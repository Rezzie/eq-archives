im a 54(soon 55) froglok paladin on cazic, and was wondering what are your methods to gain and keep agro? 

When im MT i normaly begin with Stun,FoL,Holymight and re-stun when need agro. I also use some disarm but im not very sure if it had sufficient agro to worth it. What about the lvl 9 stun call cease or desist? should i use them instead of the higher one call Stun? 
oh and does healing wave(grp heal 120hp) had in any agro?

thank in advance

I'm not a fan of Flash of Light...unless you are with an experienced team that definately knows what they are doing.  BUT, if that's the case you shouldn't need it.

First of all, understand that keeping aggro isn't just your duty but the whole group's responsibility.

That being said, you're going overboard.

Frankly, I keep 3 stuns loaded - Cease, Stun, and Force of Akera (the level 52 stun).  Even if a stun is resisted, it garners aggro.  Cease costs very little mana and casts fairly quickly.  Stun is better than Desist comparing mana cost to effectiveness of the stun itself.  Force of Akera is fast casting, and lands on mobs up to level 61 (I think, might be 60 or 62...I can never remember - but I doubt it's 62, most likely 60).

FoA is your primary stun when you get up to 55-61.  It's the one that's more guaranteed to land to interrupt.  But use the other two to get aggro or even pull (I use Cease as my pull spell all the time).

I usually pull with Cease, and run back to camp.  When the mob arrives, I then hit them with FoA - it keeps them stunned for approx 4 secs (IIRC).  By that time, the slower should be casting their slow.  Just this amount of hate is usually enough to keep the mob from aggroing the slower.  But, I usually hit taunt the second I see the slow spell message land.

By this time, Cease has already refreshed...I hit it again for good measure, as it never hurts to have too much aggro.  This could be considered overboard as well, but the mana usage is negligible.

I don't even touch disarm anymore.  It's worthless.  I haven't seen a success in ages, and the hate garnered is little.

I think that answers your question.  I rarely need to do more than that.  I will hit taunt whenever I see a huge critical DD land, just in case.  If using 1h/shield, try to time a bash just after a huge heal/DD/etc (any possible aggro-stealing spell).  That way they are bashed for a sec so you can then taunt/stun.

Disarm is a zero agro attack, in other words it will not generate any additional agro, or at least no measurable agro.

if you insist on using it though, then save yourself the hotkey and time, find out what number button it is on from the menu that generates the disarm, taunt etc buttons (alt-M) then make the following hotkey:

/doability 1 (where 1 is the button number for taunt)
/doability 2 (where 2 is the number for Disarm)

If you are bashing with a shield or 2-hand bash, then you can also add that into the same button as well. I wouldn't bother though, disarm really has no agro effect.

Generally, though use your most mana efficient stuns for agro. Cease for pulling, since it generates agro, does no damage (so mob won't summon you) and has a zero duration. Once in camp, use the cheapest stun that will land and has a duration, especially right off the bat when it isn't slowed yet. You will want to favour stuns that have a duration, rather then spamming cease and desist, because you will mitigate a considerable amount of damage by having the mob stunned. The amount of stuns needed are dependent on how much agro is needed (some groups manage agro better then others, ala-wizard sho starts off by nuking the incoming critter) and how much mana you have available.

I couldn't agree more with that last paragraph.  Well written and exactly what I would do.

However, I disagree with the most of the rest of the post.  Every study I've seen, says that disarm does add to aggro.  But yes, it is minimal and usually just not worth it.  I suppose it doesn't hurt anything to tie it into Taunt...just doesn't seem worth it, since your hotkey doesn't grey out to let you know it's unavailable.  IMO, you need to know when it's available, and not to use it until needed.  Spamming the taunt key is just a waste of energy, and sets you up to not have it when needed.

To add bash to that is scary.  Bash, while adding some decent damage, sometimes, is best for interruptions on casters.  To again, not know when it's available or use it when not needed can be detrimental.

To each his own though.  I'm not saying you are wrong, just that I wouldn't do it that way...and the above are my reasons. :)

I use Stun to tag off the puller when I am MA.  It is useful because it has low mana consumption and high aggro component.  I am level 65 and fight fairly exclusively in PoP and GoD nowadays.  The great thing about using Stun to attract attention at this level is that it will be resisted, but still generates aggro.  You can literally watch the mob change course as it stops following the puller and starts running toward you instead.

After that, when the mob is up close and personal, I lead with a Taunt, hotly followed by alternating Akilae then Akera.  This is usually enough to keep attention on me while slowing happens.  After that I alternate between Akilae and Akera.  I use Akilae most for several reasons: it is more mana efficient than Akera, it is resisted less, and recast time is slightly faster.

On a multi-pull situation I will lead with an early Group Heal even though it is possible that nobody needs healing.  Wave of Marr (don't have Wave of Trushar yet) brings plenty of aggro.  All the MoBs will be on my tail, leaving the crowd control folks to do their thing without fear of interrupts.  Also, this means the healer only needs to focus on me rather than dividing their attention between MA, puller, and chanter.

Root aggro is sometimes useful too, especially Shackles of Tunare which I understand is the fastest Root spell in the game.

I realise many of the spells I've mentioned are a bit above your level right now, but hopefully it will trigger a few thoughts for you about trying different techniques with the spells you have on hand already.

/agree Kohi

I generally have FoAkilae, FoAkera, QWoSerenity, and Cease up. I like my stuns, as you can see. :)

How I use them depends on the situation of course, but if I have adequate time, I'll use Cease to grab initial aggro off the puller. It goes just like Kohi described with Stun; even on a resist, he should come straight toward me.

As soon as the mob gets to me, I do the same as Kohi. I'll hit it with Akilae, generally followed immediately after with Akera. This serves not only to generate aggro, but to act as kind of a "ghetto slow" while the mob is being properly slowed. :)

I keep serenity up mostly for positioning, but also because it's one of only two stuns that work on some mobs, such as "militis" and higher mobs in BoT (Akera should land on casters: tyv, hellig, etc.).

If I'm having more trouble than usual keeping aggro for whatever reason, I'll keep using Akera/Cease, even if they may not take effect.

Hmm, bit of a ramble...but nothing else to do while waiting for vkr in KC...I want my VP key! ;)

Quellios' Words of <B>Tranquility</b> :P

I used to use that and force for positioning...but too many melee's bitched about it - even when I hade a /gsay "Pushing %T with stun in the direction I'm facing" macro.

I may load on times when I'm the sole melee (with pets as other melee), because it doesn't inconvenience anyone then.

I never cast a single spell on a mob until it's almost on top of the camp.  In fact, I've gotten pretty good at timing the cast time of Akilae so that it lands right when the mob is in front of me. :)  Then, I start melee and hit taunt right away.  This way I'm guaranteed on top of the aggro list (provided taunt is successful).  Then I let off 2-3 more stuns as they repop, and can then usually go afk for the rest of the fight if I want to.  ;)

As far as positioning with stuns... who cares if the other melees bitch?  Screw em.  ;)  If you're tanking it's your job to make sure the mob is in the best tactical position available... and if that means pushing the mob around some, then do it.  I for one do whatever it takes to keep the mob in a good position so pets are on the rear and so I'm far enough away from any rooted/mezzed mobs to avoid any danger of mistargeting/waking up.  As a result, I sometimes move all over the place when I MT.  :)

Wave heals do generate aggro, but in my experience, they're not something to rely on for aggro unless you have a few party members getting beat on at the time you cast it.  And even then, if they've done more to a mob than you have, you still may not pull aggro.  For example, one of the shamen I group with a lot usually has 4-5 dots on any given mob at any given time... unless I'm right on top of things and chain stun my mana out, he usually ends up tanking.  heh

Hope that helps. :)

Problem is that you can inadvertently push into the aggro range of previously contented nasty critters.  I used to use QWoT a lot too but barely use it at all nowadays.

True, but when I load a push stun, I pay damn close attention to when I use it and all objects (people/mobs/etc) around me.  Keep in mind that the stun pushes in the direction you are facing.  QWoT takes so long to cast, that it is quite easy to turn completely 180&deg; if need be.
