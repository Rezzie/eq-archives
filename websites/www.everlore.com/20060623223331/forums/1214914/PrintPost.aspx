I was bored the other night, so decided to take VI up on the DX8 test thing. I hit the testEQ thing and then changed the .ini file from DX7 to DX8.  I ran the game and all loading screens and main character menu is all blurry and half working.  Is this it?  Or am I missing something?  I hope its not fully implemented yet, because with performance like this, I won't be playing the game much if this is the final result...

Also, once they switch all servers to DX8, and it doesn't work for some of us, will the DX7 still be an option to even play or is it finished? If this isn't an option, VI is going to lose a ton of players...

All of you switching to DX8.. if your a tester great... Love yer work.. if your not.. please.. from a design perspective wait for the beta testing to complete before you load it.. all your doing by loading it early is ASKING for problems if you load it before then. After they make it for all servers Im sure *being its a setting already changeable* that you can switch back. Also I remember that they have had DX issues before and if you do have trouble please report them via the reporting method already described by VI. If you dont know that method then you really should not be trying DX8.

aye,

 If you have DX8 loaded on your machine.  Be sure to edit the eqclient.ini file back down to dx7 before playing on the live servers.

Yeah, but they asked to test it out.  I wasn't "looking for trouble", it found me!  Anyhow, if it is still in testing, then that would explain why it isn't working 100% yet. (or should it and something isn't right with my machine, which is the part that concerns me and my future with EQ)

If you report your config and bug.. as per the way VI said..  and your config is not one of the out of the ordinary situations.. VI will most likely fix the problem.. VI gave explicit instructions on how to report DX8 bugs.. as for switching things back they gave instructions on that as well and even in this post they said how.. so you should be all set. :)

OK, I'm starting to get a little pissed about this subject.  Clearly it is not working on my system.  No one seems to give a crap that it doesn't.  Is my system the only one that won't work with this test?  I find that hard to believe.  I guess, when all servers go and upgrade next week, then we'll start to hear the complaints more than just me.

And yes, I emailed the problems to VI, but doubt they care about suporting the Voodoo 3 anymore.  I guess they will loose me as a customer as I am NOT going to upgrade my video card just to continue playing this game as much as I want to.  My Voodoo 3 works for every other game I own.

Have you tried .. fdisk.. reformat ..reload from scratch the OS.. load the motherboard drivers.. load the DX drivers that came for your motherboard *if any* I know some asus motherboards hadem.. .. load the current voodoo video drivers that came for the voodoo3 and upgrade to dx8 via the usual way..Rebooting after each modification. Then load EQ .. patch it.. reboot.. patch it.. reboot patch it reboot.. then try it? with nothing else loaded on your system except those?

Actually Katarr, I do have a machine where this problem has occurred. I only use that machine for the test server. The problem I had (post DX 8.0) was that the buttons available would be obscured by blurred overlays. In fact, outside of the full screen view I could not even see the menus. This generally happened after I tried to view my inventory, and stayed as an effect thereafter. The only way to see the button format, blurred though it was, was to f10 to the full screen view and then click where the buttons showed, being that we all probably remember what each button corresponded to prior to this problem (or maybe not..sorry if ya don't).

Anyway...I did make the report for this specific video card. If you're interested, the card is a 64 mb Rage Fury Maxx. It SHOULD be supported but has NOT been tested by VI. If I recall correctly there was specific information re: YOUR card on the official Luclin support page. Anyone can go there and look up their chipset , and likely their specific card, and find out if it's supported. Just for your info, I do think that if you intend to play many more games for much longer, including this one, you will HAVE to upgrade that card sooner rather than later. It's the shits, I know, but there are other options that are cheap and readily available. For example, two days ago I bought 12 GF2 GTS 32 mb DDR cards made by visiontek for 37 dollars each. That is the card that is NOT one of the MX cards..has the T&L implemented , and will be a primary supported card for EQ. They are for machines ordered by clients of mine, but just as an example it wouldn't be difficult or too expensive to bring your rig up to spec in the vid department. BTW...I bought those cards at Ubid as package. Singles or doubles might be a few dollars more (literally, just a few).

Sharvaysta is correct...and that does pain me to say it...but you must follow the instructions given following the test patch , and report along with the text logs to VI. Also, VI HAS stated that they strongly recommend DX 8.1 , which is a larger download, so perhaps they already know of this particular issue and that it has been resolved in some way in 8.1 . I have 8.1 on my live server machine but NOT on the test bed. I'll run the test server on that machine and see what happens. If there's anything significant to say I'll post ya back...

Good luck!
