INTRODUCTION
If you have dared venture to the perilous land of Kunark,and have emerged at the Nexus and started to explore,you will notice a few buildings,with appears to be Wizard Spires.These are are not,were not,and will never be.For in those buildings,live-or haunt,skeletons of great power.As the story goes...
*******************************************************
 There lived,in the days before ogres were ugly,dumb creatures with short memory and speach,and Elves still one,a great fortress of Darkness.It was the small,but growing village of Evil.
Even then there were Necromancers,of such great power,it would put the magic users of today to shame.
Among them was Salazz,an Iksar hated and feared by all,wich was unusuall because every race hates the Iksar.Salazz though....He was immensely powerful,more than any other and none dared to challenge him.The Paladins of Tunare tried many times,and only suceeded in losing another of thier number.
  But Salazz wasn't the only one to worry about.Many good races and evil flocked to his side with the promise of riches and power.He granted them that,but also he gave them the best of the best armor and weapons,shields,and steeds.He cast illusions to make them appear as giants.
The 'Spires' were for Salazz's personal use for a point of teleportation and also generated a magical shield so powerful that no dragon could get over it and live.
 Salazz searched for an item of great value,to see into the council of the gods....for he was afraid they might plan against him.If only he knew...
*******************************************************
 It was gloomy,as had become usual,tension was high in the air of every city.A bard,shivering in her thin cloak headed towards a temple of Tunare,to pay homage and get herself warm.
As she entered the Temple and knelt before and alter,a wind,though warm and pleasant,swept through the room without rustling and fabric...a voice formed in Lillarya's head...an image of an Elf in green robes and a crown of vines formed.The voice in her head whispered;<i>'You must help us,Lillarya...'</i>
  Lillarya bowed to the alter."What must I do?"she asked,not sure where to look.The answer came as a hint in a faint whisper.<i>'Use the orb of God Sight...Salazz wants it..'</i>
*******************************************************
 Lillarya approached the spires trembling.The aura of Evil here was obvious to even a human.She stopped as soon as the was near the spires."Let me see you Salazz...I come as a friend with a warning."
A sharp,unnatural wind blew and green light filled a square foot of space.The necromancer appeared,floating several feet in the air."What warning of yours could worry me?" The necromancer said,laughing.I have seen in the Orb of God-Sight that-"She was cut short by a thunderbolt rushing to her-she jumped to the side as the ground burned where the bolt touched it.
 "Give me the Orb!" the Iksar shouted.He waited.Lillarya drew forth a crystal sphere as big as her fist.It swirled with blues and purples and gold sparks flared within.The necromancer bared his teeth."Well..I won't give it to you!"Lillarya shouted,throwing the crystal at the spires where the Sorcerer caught it.He advanced a few steps outside the bounds of the gate,and screamed.An explosion of fire,lightning rained from the sky and an odor of decay spread.The Iksar screamed as he and his followers were sucked of body and soul and Lillarya ran.She wasn't afraid of the Gods,she wasn't thier object of anger.She ran in case the undead that she knew would lurk their,wallowing in thier misery would attack her when the storm of rage subsided.
  The villagers rejoiced,and Lillarya was made a hero.
*******************************************************
And so,the 'Spires' and undead within remain.An Evil the Paladins of all good deities shall destroy with pleasure.
                   ***********
                     THE END
 Was that ok?It's kind of a first attempt..I just know about this because mu lvl 5 enchanter was exploring kunark invis.
