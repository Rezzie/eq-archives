Copied from eqbeastlord.com:

"My name is Johnnymc, and I'm addicted to Evercrack.

I tried to quit about a year ago, but I've secretly been missing it. Suddenly, however, my buddies at school want to play. We've decided to make things a bit more challenging than usual by following this rule:

No communications at all with other people besides each other. That means no grouping, no bartering, no buffing/recieving buffs, and no chatting with people who don't go to our school."

Because I won't be able to trade for higher lvl armors and camping for them would be tough if not impossible, I thought that maybe tailoring would be a good idea. Studded Acrylia is pretty nice stuff for a mid30s-40s beastlord. In fact, considering that I'll probably use PSU's til the mid 30s, studded acrylia armor would be very nice.

I'm going to have to camp everything myself, except what friends will trade me. Where should I hunt for stuff and what should I make? I don't want to do multiple skills but I will if I have to.

Note: a friend will probably be BSing to help me with studs.

heh, that seems like an awesome way to play. take a look at this:

<A HREF="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipesearch.html?tradeskill=Tailoring" TARGET="_BLANK">http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/recipesearch.html?tradeskill=Tailoring</A>

that has all the recipes for tailoring, in case you didnt have them already. to me, the only challenging part would be getting the rockhopper pelts, which even to a 56 bst can get a little annoying, seeing as how they occasionally blind me (about 1/100 though). you also will probably have to do multiple tradeskills to make the armor if your friends arent training smithing and brewing for the other materials you need. also, good luck getting the armor at lvl 30, the hoppers are pretty tough to kill, even with a group. your best bet would be to concentrate on making wu's armor, which will get you some nice gear, considering your making it yourself, as well as major TS increase. hope this info helps you, good luck!
