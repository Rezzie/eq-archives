OK I made an Iskar Monk, he just turned 10 a few mins ago... Does Tiger Strike ever go up in damage?? mine seems to be hitting for 8-9 dmg...I found some Heavy Ulak (something or other) and vendors and am using them.  How does Mend work now, that is do I still keep hitting the button when it pops up, or do I wait till I have damage??  Also, does the sucess rate go up on it, mine usually says it fails.
I am mainly wearing Curscale armor, what armor should I be trying to obtain next?
where is a good place for me to hunt at this level?

these are just a few questions, thanks in advance for the input.

As far as damage on tiger strike, I don't really know.  I have an 18 monk and I just move to the next special ability and don't really worry about it.

As far as mend, though I haven't tried it myself, I have been told that it only works now when you are damaged.

A great way to do this is to run down a wall.  you're raising your safe fall and mend skills.

I haven't heard that about mend, but I'm doubting it.  Mend works like LoH but just less of a heal.  There would be no reason to make it not work when full HP.

Mend will fail, and fail a LOT until you reach 100 skill.  After that it will work quite a bit, with just a few fails.  My monk, when she was in her low 30s, had about a 98% success rate with it.

Hit it every time it ungrays...unless you are solo'ing, in which you don't want to do that and get a critical failure (it hurts you).  Once you have it capped for your level, which you won't, you can stop hitting it.

I wish I could tell you more on the special attacks, but I've forgotten almost everything I knew about my monk...I stopped playing her ages ago, and deleted her shortly after LDoN to make her into a cleric.

Mend:  Macro your mend with your special attack at your level.  It will never / rarely work but you will have a chance of getting a point every time it is ungreyed and you use your special attack - essentially macro it and forget about it.  Once you get to about 60-70 skill unmacro it and start using it as a useful skill.  It has saved me many many times and you will not want to be without it.

Tiger Strike:  It wont go up in damage too much between your level and the level you get your next attack.  Always use your most recent attack.  I have maxed my Flying Kick now and now I am working on my Tail Rake,  then Eagle Strike.  Those are the only 3 I will max because they are associated with Disciplines at high levels.

FD:  Mend and FD will be your coup de force.  Save ALL of your training points and when you get to 16 (i think it was 16, maybe 17) put all of them into FD.  That will define you as a puller and make it so you can solo well.

Learn to pull.  Lots of guides on pulling. 

Good Luck.

I would disagree with putting all the points into FD.  FD is very easy to skill up.  Hell, I had a macro that would FD, ID, and sneak all in one.  Just target a group member and hit it now and then.

Or, if you don't want to worry about the accidental ID causing a feared mob to run away starting a train...then just hit FD every time it pops up...even while running.

Hell, I advise making a macro that makes you FD and then stand up again to work on it.  It's great to have when running away from a MOB but you don't want to waste time finding the stand button (or hitting CTRL-S) in case it fails.

However, MEND is a bitch to skill up.  Definately put as many points into it as you can...it's worth it.

Here is an FDPractice macro I used when fighting to practice FD - your skill will go up quick.  Now here is the kicker - As a Monk, if you are not the Main Tank.. You do not want Aggro - it makes your Healers job harder.  Now that my FD is close to maxed I dont use it much to practice but I use it to drop aggro in groups.  It works well and helps me to keep Aggro on the MT (Main Tank).

/attack off
/doability # (the number assigned to fd)
/stand
/attack on

You get aggro - hit this and aggro will (90% of the time) go back to MT.

The only thing I would leave off, is the last line - /attack on.

By keeping it in there, it wouldn't be a usable macro during downtime, just in case you hit it while shopping or talking to any NPC.

It's not that hard to just re-engage auto-attack after using your "evade" (that's what I would call it) macro.  Hell, every second your late in re-engaging auto-attack is less aggro you're building up (granted, less DPS, too).

I had more macros on my monk than any other character.  I had combined skill macros to hit while just chatting with friends.  I had macros to use while travelling to work on skills.  Monks just have so many damn clickable skills to work on. :)
