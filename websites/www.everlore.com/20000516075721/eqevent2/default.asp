The EverQuest Gathering II in Saint Louis was a complete Success. Originally there were about 150 people
 signed up, but over 260 people attended! We were let in early to help setup and get our netcam online.
  Throughout the entire day our cam was streaming pictures every 30 seconds. The Everlore &quot;EverQuest
   is our Bitch&quot; T-Shirts were also a hit. We sold almost all of our T-Shirts, which were a little
    over 100.</p>
    <p>
At 9:00 AM the doors were opened and people started pouring in the hall. As soon as everyone was seated,
 Kevin Scott, (one of the event organizers) made a few introduction announcements. Many things were planned
  such as a Real Life Quest and a group EverQuest trivia game. The winners were awarded with free copies of
   the Expansion pack when it becomes available. After the initial announcement the event got started.</p>
<p>
Verant was having some technical difficulties setting up the Kunark showcase but that was soon resolved.
 Crowds of people formed around the two displays as Brad McQuaid and others showed them the new world.
  We will be releasing videos of Kunark demonstration later this week. The demonstration was basically
   the highlight of the event. It went on for many hours and there was always a large crowd of people
    watching and taking pictures. </p>
<p>
The first planned event took place right after lunch. It was the &quot;Real Life Quest&quot;. People
 formed into groups and received a listing of quest items that they were supposed to find around the area.
  People came in with all sorts of things such as pieces of a tire, rug, etc. Stuff they found downtown and
   in the hotel! After a few hours, awards were handed out to the winners of the Quest Event. The next event
    was the Trivia game. People organized into groups and received a list of things such as name all the zones
     in Norrath or explain the history. Stryder and myself really needed to get some fresh air so we took off
      down town for a bit. We tried to go to the top of the arch but unfortunately they were sold out :(. When we
       returned the trivia was just about over. </p>
<p>
The next few hours were basically the Q&amp;A time for Brad McQuaid and other Verant staff. At one point
 there was a circle of over 100 people around Brad. We managed to have a long chat with a few guys and do
  two video interviews. Hopefully after some editing, we can get them online this week. We took about 65
   pictures including the arch, and all the netcam shots, which is well over 500.</p>
<p>
Lastly the event came to a close. Kevin gave some last words and more prizes were handed out. He then
 uncovered Verant's huge box of Kunark posters, stickers and more. Everyone went into a poster grabbing
  frenzy and mobbing the Verant crew for autographs. Thanks goes out to Verant for sponsoring the event
  , Kevin and Cindy for organization and Nick Kremenek for the great event artwork! Hopefully the Gathering
   III will be even bigger! You can also find another great report of events at <a href="http://www.makeitsimple.com/news/gamenews/everquest_g2/default.htm"> MakeitSimple.com</a><br><br>
