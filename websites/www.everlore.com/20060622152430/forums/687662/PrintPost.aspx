What would be the quickest path to level 60ish and how long do you estimate it would take? 

I have been considering trying an enchanter character after comparing classes.  I noticed that the enchanter class is actually the class I find the most interesting.  The problem is that I only decided this long after trying out other classes (one of them to level 54) so now I must start from level 1.  I do not have the option to twink any characters anymore so I will have to start from scratch entirely.  I cannot afford to spend extremely long periods of time on the game therefore I seek very quick leveling.

I need advice on how one would level an enchanter quickly to level 50 (if I can get there then the character is high enough I can continue without worrying about rushing as much).  Do to the nature of this strategy I would only be soloing (not a problem since I tend to do things that making soloing interesting).

My current theory is this: 
Post level 12 I would buy the charm spell, the psell memory blur, whatever other spells can be afforded (as most of these are less important in these strategy they come next), and keep a supply of SoW potions on hands whenever money permits.  Then if possible I would consider buying mana regen buffs (although this would be not necessary).  I would then proceed to go to a zone which has effective creatures that can be charmed and have them defeat lesser npcs very rapidly.  Perhaps for example Griffawns against Carrion beetles.  If charm breaks I can run and root then enemy due to the SoW potions.  Also, memory blur can perhaps substitute if I cannot afford SoW potions.  I have heard memory blur wipes out all argo from nps which causes them to quit attacking you.  

Does anyone have any type of advice?  Questions of particular interest include:
Where to hunt?
Which npcs to charm?
Which techniques work best?
How long do you estimate it would take to get around at least level 45 or so?  This is very important because I cannot really afford to spend extremely long periods of time on the game.  I am hoping level 45 or even 50 can be achieved in one month.... although my last character took much longer to get to that point.....

All help is appreciated.
