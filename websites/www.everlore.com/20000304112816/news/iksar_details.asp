<font size="2"><b><font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2">Welcome to Cabilis!</font></b>
  <hr>
  <font face="Verdana,Arial" size="2"><b>Iksar Monks</b><br>
  Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, or
  New Sebilis as some may call it, is a great walled city located deep in the
  heart of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis
  foresaw your inner strength. It was then that your path was chosen for you.
  Now that you have reached the season of rebirth you have been summoned to the
  Court of Pain, training grounds and temple of the Swifttail Caste. There you
  shall learn the ancient combat arts of the monk. Through discipline and
  sacrifice your body, mind and soul shall be forged into a weapon. Being an
  Iksar you know that your race stands alone and allies are few and not to be
  trusted. It is only within the city of Cabilis that you are truly safe.<br>
  <hr>
  This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY

  <b>Iksar Necromancer</b><br>
  Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, or
  New Sebilis as some may call it, is a great walled city located deep in the
  heart of the continent of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the
  Hierophants of Cabilis detected the mana surging within your life force and
  thus your path was chosen for you. Now that you have reached the season of
  rebirth you have been summoned to the infamous Tower of Death. It is there
  that you shall be introduced to the dark circle of magic known as necromancy.
  The scholars of the temple shall welcome you into the Brood of Kotiz to begin
  your studies. Most Iksar residents fear and respect the Brood of Kotiz. The
  rumors of experiments performed on fellow Iksar run rampant. All other Iksar
  castes have respect for the Brood. Beware of other races as well as outsiders
  from abroad. They have no love for the Iksar. It is only within Cabilis that
  you are truly safe.

  <b>Iksar Shamans</b><br>
  Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, or
  New Sebilis as some call it, is a great walled city located deep in the heart
  of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, the Hierophants of Cabilis detected a
  spark of great wisdom within your life force. It was then that your path was
  chosen. Having reached the season of rebirth you have been summoned to the
  Temple of Terror. It is there that you shall study the ways of the unholy
  shaman known as the Scaled Mystics. Through the Hierophants, ancient Iksar
  ancestors shall guide you through the stages of the Scaled Mystics so that one
  day you may become a vessel of great power. Together with the Crusaders of
  Greenmist you form the religious backbone of the Iksar empire. The Iksar
  Legion does not act without the aid of the Scaled Mystics. Know that all other
  nations upon Norrath fear and dislike the Iksar and cannot be trusted. Only
  within Cabilis are you truly safe.

  rebirth, it is time to abandon your life and journey to the Temple of Terror
  to begin your training in the brotherhood of the Crusaders of Greenmist,
  shadowknights of Cabilis. There you shall learn the ways of torture and
  discipline under the direction of the Lords of Pain. You shall prepare
  yourself for the crusades to come. Know that all other nations fear you. The

  <b>Iksar Warriors</b><br>
  Welcome to Cabilis, the new capitol of the reborn Iksar empire. Cabilis, or
  New Sebilis as some call it, is a great walled city which lies deep in the
  heart of the continent of Kunark. Long before you were hatched, your path was
  chosen for you by the Hierophants of Cabilis. Now that you have reached the
  appropriate season of your long life it is time for you to abandon the
  innocence of a broodling and report for duty as a new recruit within the
  Legion of Cabilis. Under the tutorage of the Drill Masters you shall become a
  great warrior. You shall protect your people with pride for there are many
  dangers within the untamed lands of Kunark as well as the rumor of the arrival
  of adventurers from abroad. As a member of the once great Iksar Empire you are
  aware of the hatred and fear other races have of you. Only within Cabilis are
  you truly safe.
