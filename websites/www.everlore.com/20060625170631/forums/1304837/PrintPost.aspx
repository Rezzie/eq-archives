Hey everyone, I have all the pieces for my epic except the gnarled staff off Venril Sathir.  I never played Kunark before, but I bought it recently so I can obtain my epic.  Can anyone who has already done this part please tell me how this is done, how many people I would need to get to him and camp him, and approx how long it will take for the staff to drop as well as his spawn time.
Even if you just have some pieces of info not all of it, it would be greatly appreciated.

Venril Sathir is a lvl 55 Warrior...he has some mobs tha can CH with him. He has about 18k hit points.....when i killed him i did it with around 30 guys, but depending on your lvls maybe 3-4 grps can handle him...he hits hard and can proc a 1500 dmg lifetap. The key is to kill him very fast (wizards, rogues, and monks) his spawn time is about 3 days i think....and the Gnarled Staff is a common drop....hiope this helps

I did Venril Sathir yesterday, so might as well post here now though the post is a bit old...

We did it with about 4 groups of lvl 50+ ppl, maybe a bit less, about 20 ppl.. But it cant be done with less..

The trick is to have a lvl 60+ tank with about 6K hp, and at least 3 chanters with Rune 5, and at least 2 clerics with CH...

The prep room in KC need to be cleared, and you need an FD puller to clear ANY adds from VS room... (If VS aggroes before room is clear, FD need to just stand and die, if VS aggroes the rest of the raiding party you will, and i repeat, you WILL ALL die!

When VS room is clear, MT need to be fully buffed and have Rune 5 up... No need in buffing everyone else cos' if ANYONE else than MT gets aggro you WILL ALL die!

MT attacks VS and builds aggro, with 3 chanters Chain Rune 5 him... VS procs 1500 lifetap VERY VERY often, but with Rune he wont get any life back, just tap the runes... So Rune 5 is even more important than CH, and without it VS cant be done!

3-4 patch healers like shammies, druids will be good as they chain cast 3-400hp heals on MT, which wont get aggro, and will save him if a CH lands too late! Clerics cast CH randomly with a 5 second interval! CH shouldnt be needed if Chain runing, but it should be done for safety reasons!

Tank should use 5+ secs to get aggro and then call assist! It is VERY important tank have aggro, cos' if VS bounces and starts attacking others his procs will heal him instantly and you will all die!

When tank calls aggro every melee jump in (You should have about 14 melees+)...

When VS is at about 40% health ALL wizzies nuke him with Lure spells like Lure of Flame.. You MUST use lure spells cos' they cant be resisted... VS will resist all other nukes and it will be useless.. When Wizzies Chain cast lure spells VS should go down in a few seconds...

If the fight lasts longer than 30-45 seconds, or MT dies you will get wipe!


This was done yesterday, and it worked like a charm with only one Necro casualty cos' he had pet on VS in front of him!

Plan this good, and you will get VS easily... You're welcome to e-mail me with questions

Regards...

I have already taking downs VS 2 times neither time he has dropped the Staff for me.
classes you need is Enchanters Wizards Monks and Rogues. With a good pulling monk you don't have to worry about his healers because you can single pull them gisrt kill them and then pull VS. VS is a Warrior this is stated on EVERY board that you look at to do the epic he does life tap for 1500.
you have to make sure that the MA gets good argo because if he starts to pingpong your raid will be over very quickly with him lifetaping everything. He is simple to take down. you must have lvl 60 Enchanters that can chain rune the tank( this is a absolute must ! )  have 2 lvl 60 chanters and take him pull the room single and you'll have no problem killing him 

be safe all

How can he life tap for 1500 unless he is a necro or a shadowknight? Those are the really only ways you can proc a lifetap unless he has a weapon that procs for him

you're an idiot, Venril Sathir is a warrior.  Let me ask you this, if he was a Shadowknight, why doesnt he cast? He doesnt Harm Touch, Fear or cast any spells.  Mobs work the same as PCs for the most part, a warrior can wield a weapon with a proc and that's what VS is doing, only it doesnt drop off of him becuase a 1500LT proc would ruin the game as well as the purpose of a cleric.  Think before you call people "flakes" and its obviously you're obscurity that makes you want't to drive an axe through your computer.

Venril Sathir is a warrior 4 reasons hes a war he quads, he doesnt harmtouch, never has a pet up, and doesnt cast anything(lifetap is a proc if he was a sk he would dot sometime you know...). His 1500 lifetap isnt single its an ae proc and its a weapon that doesnt drop. to everything in front of him so when you single pull him have the warrior stand where vs is not facing the raid because he will ae lifetap everyone in front of him and you will wipe. I have heard of a strategy of putting rune V on mt and it will counteract the lifetap and null the effect. Need dps for this mob 30k hp not that hard especially since velious etc. Just watch agro. I have my epic this mob isnt all that hard.
