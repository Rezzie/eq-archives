Just wondering if anyone has an idea of Faelin Bloodbriar's spawn time, and a better location of where she spawns rather then a loc. Thank you, 
Kerenaa

She spawns around 1500, 500 near Orc Hill and the entrance to Crushbone. 

 

She has an Orc Pawn placeholder that is standing between two trees. An easy way to make sure this pawn is killed is to sit.  The pawn will immediately attack you when it spawns.

 

Make sure that you continue to SoW yourself. When Faelin does spawn, she immediately SoWs herself and takes off running! 

 

When you see her on tracking take out the note and start running to her. She runs in a circular pattern and will not stop if hailed. 

 

Run up behind her and give her the note. Once you have given her the note you will receive a ring and she will despawn.

Just to clarify a bit more, I've camped Faelin on numerous occasions for my own epic and to help out friends.

To get to her general spawn loc: from the orc lift in kelethin head straight toward CB, right before the path ends, hook a half-left and the hill on which she spawns will be a short click away from you.  Double check your /loc to be sure you are in the right spot, but hopefully that will give you an easy starting point to get to it.

The previous poster is correct, if you sit right at the edge of the flat spot on the hill where she spawns, her PH will agro and you can kill it easily.  Sit so that the tree city is somewhat behind and to the left of you and you will be facing her spawn point.

She does not only SoW herself on spawn, she actually seems to cast 2-3 buffs before running off.  If you are watching for her carefully, you will have enough time to jump up and hand her the turn in before she takes off.  She seems to be a rather random spawn, I've seen her pop in 20 minutes or as long as 4 hours.

Hope this helps a bit and good luck to you =)
