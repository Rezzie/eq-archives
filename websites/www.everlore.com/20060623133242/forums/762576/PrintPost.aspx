Hey I am a lvl 55 paladin on Zeb.  For some reason, I have not been able to gather too many pp in my travels (the most I have ever had at once was 2,700 pp) so I may have leveled past my armor.  So at 55 I went 100% AA and have gotten run3 and regen3.  I have one more and am halfway through another to get CS 1 (or should i get ND?).  I was wondering if it was bright to stay at 55 and wait till I get some more AA's to move on or should I stop and start leveling again.  For some reason I cant get enough money to get any good armor (I have had one armor upgrade since lvl 48 heh) so I don't know what to do.  Where can I go at 56 anyway?  I currently mostly hunt PoI and PoN.  I hear PoV is great but I don't have a flag and I would have a hard time getting group.
Thanks
Elfhame

Woot, Z-town represent! Err, okay that was lame.

I am a firm believer in levels > AA. I think run3 is good to stop leveling to get, but for everything else, I'd wait until 62+ (so you can get into BoT), but preferably 65.

However, if you're that close to getting a level 1 archetype AA, you might as well finish it out. I would suggest putting it into CA as opposed to CS or ND, as I am also a believer in avoidance > mitigation.

PoV is indeed great, and unless I am mistaken, the level limit for unflagged folks is 55, so you should be able to get in. However, I'd also suggest looking into LDoN missions, for the drops, the faction/charm aug, and the points...and the experience isn't too bad to boot. There's a nice mask in EF, a nice BP in Tak, a nice cape in BB, etc.

Also, do you have a Magelo profile? It would make it a little easier to offer some more accurate advice.

Thanks for the input occam.  Now, you said the level limit for PoV is 55 "unflagged".  Now, I know what a flag is and does (well kinda not really).  All I know is that it lets you into certain zones.  When you say "unflagged does that mean I can go there wiithout a flag?  Lol, I don't know where PoV is either.  Is it connected to one of the other Planes?  Come to think of it I don't have the slightest idea how people get into the second tier planes.  
thanks,
Elfhame

A flag is basically a trait your character obtains that allows you to access something. You can't outwardly tell what flags someone has; to find out, you must talk to the Seer in PoK.

For example, if you're level 50 and try to zone into PoV and you aren't flagged, it will give you a message telling you you can't get in. If you complete a trial in Plane of Justice, however, you'll see a message saying "You have received a character flag!" From then on, you can zone into PoV no matter what your level. Alternatively, if you're 55+, you can just zone in (same goes for PoStorms and CoD). At level 62, you can get into BoT and HoH, but beyond that, you'll need flags.

Flags are different from keys in that they are not actual objects, and they can be taken into consideration for other flags. For example, you can't ever get into the Elemental Planes unaided without having done a PoJ trial, no matter what other flags you have. Though you can get in now, you'll still need a PoJ flag to progress. EQ will be able to track what flags you have.

There are some exceptions. If you are part of a raid of at least 36 people, and at least 85% of them are flagged for the zone and are currently in the zone, then the remainder can get in without flags.

The zone in to the Plane of Valor is in the Plane of Tranquility. It's up on the hill near the Plane of Justice. Look for a small castle-like structure which is the opening of a short cave. Inside that cave are several stones which serve as the zone-ins to PoV, PoTactics, Halls of Honor, Tower of Solusek Ro, and a couple unused ones.

Plane of Storms is further down, lower on the hill, near PoI and PoN. There's another tunnel, which leads to a large hill covered by a force field of some sort; that's PoStorms. Past that is a stone with lightning on it that goes to Bastion of Thunder.

Okay, a few suggestions (though I'm not terribly good at equipment checks, so you may want to check with the people at <a href="http://p202.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathfrm12">Paladins of Norrath</a>.)

A mask...pretty much any mask. The mask from EF adventures is great, but there are various options in the Bazaar for cheap that would be an upgrade. Acrylia Studded/Reinforced for example.
A back item...White Bear Pelt Cloak can be pretty cheap these days.
BP...the Architect's Bejeweled Chestplate from Takish.
Rings...Valorium Rings of Gallantry are nice, or at least Velium Fire Wedding Rings (6 ac/65 hp)

Not many other suggestions...I suck at this. :P Definitely start doing some LDoN missions if you have the expansions, and get the free PoP charm and augment it with the adventurer's stone. If you don't have LDoN, I'd seriously consider looking into it. In my opinion, it's the best expansion for the casual player.
