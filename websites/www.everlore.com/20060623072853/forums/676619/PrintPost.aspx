I wish SOE had never made PoK books!  I was really looking forward to porting people around for some extra cash and juuuuuuust before i got to level 29, THEY MADE THE STUPID POK BOOKS!!!  Now like 99.999999% of ppl have PoP (I don't :(  Wish i did) and they aaaaaallll use PoK books.  I think SOE really shouldn't of even thought about making those books, now its way too easy to port around and mnay druids and wizards are going out of bussiness :(.  If they only had PoK books in hard to reach zones even with a tp like OT and such, then i'd be fine because there would still be plenty of ppl wanting ports.  But nooooo, now they are in like every other zone!  I'm mad!  People used to give anything for ports and now since SOE had to go and screw up the EQ econamy We are lucky if we get 1 port a week!  Geez!  They make me sick!  ERG!!!  I'm soo mad! AGH!!!! *bangs head on keyboard* I! HATE! THE! STUPID! POK! BOOKS!  WHY! WHY! WHY! JGHFKHFGYK!!!!!!!!! *bashes computer* ARG!!!!!  COME ON FELLOW DRUIDS!  LETS GO HURT WHOEVER THOUGHT OF POK BOOKS!

/e hands the wood elf a batwing crunchie

Easy there..... I'm a druid as well, and yes I'm not to thrilled about the books either... Just not for the same reasons.

I can still make some plat porting people to stoneburnt (to get players to LoY zones) and good old CS for some wyvern hunting, but most of the time if Im not doing anything I'll port for free.

/e ducks 

Okay... The real reason why I'm not happy with the books is that it has taken a lot of the adventure out of the game.  Used to be quite a run to get to The Overthere.  But now, click a book.  In Butcherblock and want to go to Freeport? Take a boat? Not now.. How about FV zone to go into the LoIO? Granted not as many people hunt there in their mid 20s or so any more, but some people are realizing that sometimes, the old ways can be the best ways (see about the battle wizzard later in my post *shudder*)

Used to take time to get to places.  It has, in my opinion, made the game more for the 'just give it to me now, I don't realy want to work for it' kind of player.  You know the kind.. The people who don't play their class well because they got PLed from day one.  Like a battle wizzard (yeah... you heard me) who would rather melee than cast because that way he won't get hit by the mob.

*sigh*

/e goes back to making batwing crunchies....

Are you kidding?!  PoK books were the greatest addition they, well, added!  It eliminated one of the most annoying time sinks in the game.

If a city like Erudin can have teleports, why can't the whole world of Norath have them?

Oh boo-hoo, you can't make a few extra plat.  Well they fixed KEI just before my enchanter was high enough to cast it.  That eliminated more than half the possible customer base.

I have no sympathy for this kind of whining. Actually, it churns my stomach to hear it.  Spend your time getting experience.  Get an LDoN group and do an adventure, they have pretty good loot.

They made the game easier, and hence more fun, for 90% of the population.  If you were counting on making big bucks from porting, then you had a bad plan all along.

Okay problem with post above:
You just love PoK books because you are too lazy to have a little adventure and go the long way.  I agree with post above that, PoK books take out the fun of adventuring and now barely any of the noobs know the world around their starting zone because almost all of them used the pok books to port around.  Seriously, SOE really screwed up the EQ econamy, and yes EQ does have an econamy.  If EQ were real life and the econamy was just as important as the US's econamy, then SOE would've just ruined it because the druids and wizzy's wont be making all that much money any more, and without any money, they can't pay taxes, and without taxes, norrath would fall apart.  And plus in the EQ world if you couldn't pay taxes then theyd hang you :(.  What i'm trying to say is that SOE really screwed up the econamy and just helped those lazy ppl like you who have absolutely no sense of adventure, and hurt those who wish to have a little bit of chalenge in the game.  EQ was perfect the way it was without PoK books, and they have to go and screw it up.

And no i didn't create my druid just to make cash by tping ppl, i made him cuz druids are so freakin kewl :)

I'm not too worried about the economy, honestly, if you hang out in the PoK for a while you will see people

/ooc paying for port to ...

My druid was of porting level before PoK came out, and trust me, the mad plat you seem to think that was to have, just wasn't there... You and 30 other druids sitting in the Nexus all fighting for the one or two ports here and there.... Trust me.. the plat did not roll in hand over fist.

Honestly, people missing out on the adventure of exploring their newbie area or the connecting zones.  I'm a halfling for example, and when I go into Mistythicket I kinda expect to see halfling newbies running around.  Instead, when PoK came out, there where Eurds, Woodies, Gnome, and Dwarfs running around.  Kind of takes the roleplaying out of the roleplay game.

:)

Adventure?!  Where's the adventure in sitting on a boat for fifteen minutes?  Where's the adventure in sitting *waiting* for a boat for even longer before that?  Where's the adventure in running across a barren landscape like West Karana?  Sure you might run into a giant, and if it is close enough it will most like wipe you out in two hits.  Woohoo!  Fun times!

I'd prefer to get where I want to go, do what I want to do, without waiting for some uppity druid to port me there.

If anything I'd say it *helped* the economy (spelled with an "O", not an "A" btw).  Now people can spend their time being productive instead of sitting and waiting.  The only thing it hurt were the few druids that sat around fighting over the few ports that were requested.

I was in a similar situation when PoP came out. I had just reached the level where I could port to almost all the wizzy locations.  However, I have never and will never complain about the addition of the teleportation books. Hell, I use them all the time with my wizzy. :)

My only complaint would be wishing they would add a couple more so people would choose to group in some of the zones that are harder to get to now.

Anyway, you still have the Luclin zones to port people to. :)

well like i said, you just dont like adventure just cuz your too lazy to do a little bit of walking.  And sorry if i spelled "economy" wrong, i'm a bad speller =/, some words i spell right, some i dont, live with it :).  Well anyway i just think that SOE really hates Druids and Wizzy's, or else they wouldn't of done that.  Yes, summoner of pets, you have good ideas.  PoK books really take all of the adventure and roleplaying out of EQ, if EQ were real, why would there be other races running around everywhere? and plus the only reason erudin has teleports is because the erudites are so freakin smart!  If we humans in the real world found out about some mystic portal that can teleport anybody absolutely anywhere in the world in just a few seconds, do you think thered immediatly be 7564786590498649864987687543956 portals world-wide?  No, there wouldn't, because it takes time to build stuff.  Second, if there were some kind of travel like PoK books in the real world, wouldn't we have to pay to use them?  Yes i beleive we would.  Nothing is free, there would always be somekind of fee to pay because whoever is running the portals would have to make money in some way, all the research and stuff for upgrades on the portal.  Thirdly, why would there be a PoK book in almost every freakin city?  Wouldn't that make it sooooo easy for bad guys to just port from their cities and immediatly be able to attack the other city?  And think about it, look at how plain in sight those books are? I do agree that they are hidden in a way, but to have billions of ppl porting in and out, dont you think someone would notice them?  And because it would make it soooo easy for armies to break into the city that way, wouldn't the city send out some ppl to destroy the books?  Think about it, PoK books just don't keep the old roleplaying feel to EQ, no one adventures anymore, more newbies are dying because they may have takne the wrong book, etc.  I thnik adventuing is good for you, yes being kill;ed by a giant is no fun, and sitting waiting for a boat for 15 minutes is no fun, but where is the feel of adventure?  Have you read any fantasy books that have portals that characters can easily port around to the place that they need to go in 5 seconds? no, that would make the book amazingly boring, while it may make EQ easier for some ppl, for others, it just takes out all the fun of EQ.

Ok, now you're just being silly.

Armies invading cities?  When was the last time an army of anything invaded anywhere in EQ?  Or was that just another over-extended "If EQ were real" analogy?  EQ is not real.  You can't cast a spell to get to the other side of the world.  You can't really compare economies since EQ has an unlimited source of income.  The real world doesn't have people who will buy any peice of junk you find laying on the ground.  It doesn't have caves full of monsters that automatically fills up even after you kill everything in sight.

As for the adventure, I already addressed that part, but you seemed to ignore it and simply restate your claim.  Adventurers in books may not teleport around much, but how often does it take two sentences for them to cross the continent?  It may take them two weeks, but the author doesn't describe all the mundane details because *that* would be boring.  He cuts to the action.

If you enjoy riding on a boat with nothing to do (can't even fish!), then more power to you.  Adventure away.  Me?  I'd prefer to get a group and go kill things.  Lazy?  No.  I've done my share of boat-riding and running cross-country pre-portal.  I don't play the game to waste my time with pointless tasks.  

"It takes time to build stuff."  Ok, if you want to use that logic, then that's why there weren't portals at the very beginning.  That's why there aren't portals all over Norath.

"Newbies dying because they took the wrong book."  Is that any different than a newbie getting killed in the middle of a desert with no idea where they are?  Both sound like the same kind of "adventure" to me.

If you dislike the portals so much (and you knew this was coming) -- don't use them.  But don't take them away for the other 95%+ that don't enjoy the monotony of long travel times.


I've made my point.
-- C.

EDIT:
PS:  Let's use your real world analogy.  Say you work in New York and need to go to California.  Work is paying for it, so as far as you are concerned it is free.  Do you walk?  Ride a bike?  Drive?  No, you take a plane.  Lazy?  No.  Practical.  But just think of all the adventures you could have along the way and all the people you could meet in the small towns.  It doesn't matter.  You need to get to Cali and do your thing.  If there were a faster way, say a teleporter with a free, unlimited supply of energy, I'm sure you'd even use it.  Get to Cali, and then worry about having an adventure.

If you want a vacation/adventure, you can still do that, but don't eliminate airplanes for all the other people that still need a fast mode of transportation.

Ok, *now* I've had my say.
-- C.

I admit the boat rides where boring... but I do remember way back when i was level 10 or so riding the boat from BB to Freeport.... or was it the other way... anyway... looking out over the edge of the boat, in the rain... all dark.. can't see much... a flash of lightning....

In the distance I see a mob, huge.. has to be or i wouldn't see him all the way over here, just trudging along a shoreline..

OMG.... what the hell was that?


Okay we all now know his name is Gornit and he looks like a Hill Giant, but at that time I had never seen one. But it is that experiance that is now going to be missed... who goes to OOT now? Druids who are looking for a tainted, or those crazy trade skillers picking up some fishing gear (tackle boxs and hooks)

Or how about the many good conversations I've had with people while waiting for or on the boat? It's good sometimes to have some downtime and get away from the grind...

but that's just my opinion.

Dude, Cerpicio.

I'm not saying that EQ IS real, and you know that, i'm saying that all roleplaying games are supposed to have ROLEPLAYING in them!  I'm not saying that armies have ever attacked other cities, but think about it, if EQ werer a book, what would the author have them do?  They would want to get into the city the easiest and fastest way.  And which way is that?  PoK BOOKS!!!  And while PoK books may seem to make things easier, they really make the game boring.  Games are supposed to be challenging, not so easy that you can get to where you want to go in 5 seconds.

If i could get PoP, then i would, but I would never use the PoK books unless i had to get somewhere that was no where near any druid portals in a hurry.  I thnik that PoK books were added at the last minute, by someone who cares about money and only money, saying that, "if we put these in, we'll make more money!!!"  And of course all those Trolls at SOE who's IQ is less than 4, decided it was a good idea.

Seriously, SOE should think about the players before they put something waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to easy in there, maybe have a poll on their website asking what players would like in the new expansion.  Believe me, since PoK books make the game soooooo much easier, many people are hitting high levels faster, and are quitting the game, ending up with SOE losing another account.

Okay, i took the time to carefully put this post into paragraphs, now read it carefully first before you decide to defend your precious books in another post.

I *have* read your posts carefully, regardless of their structure or lack of it.  You've said nothing to refute any of my comments, only tried to come up with new excuses.

1) "Ooo, I hate them!  I can't make mega-bucks like I planned on even though other druids admit there really wasn't mega-bucks to be made!"

2) "Oh, no wait!  Adventure!  They've taken all the adventure out of the game!  The game is so boring now."

3) "No, what I meant was role-playing!  They've elimintated all role-play from the game. Yeah, *that's* why I hate the books!"

EQ is not real life, even though you aren't saying it is real, you are using it as a comparison, which you shouldn't.  EQ isn't even a book.  EQ is a game.  People play games to have fun.  Sitting and waiting is not fun.  Fighting and action is fun.

If you think role-playing is fun (and if you really think EQ is a role-playing game, that's another story.  When's the last time you saw anyone actually role-play for more then a few lines of text?), then role-play all you want.  You can still RP even though there are easy portals for travelling.  There are plenty of people in PoK (or EC, BB, etc now if you don't have PoP) to interact with.  Portals didn't change that.

Sony was thinking about money?!  *gasp!*  Of course they were.  They knew if they added portals more people would enjoy the game and play more since they wouldn't have to sit and wait and be bored.  

Oh, and now:
4) "No, no, no, forget all that other stuff.  They've made the game far too easy!  That's really why I hate the PoK portals."

They may have made the game a little easier, but I don't think it has had the drastic affect of people leveling noticibly quicker.

Pick an arguement and stick with it.

Anyway, I've said all I have to say.  Feel free to have the last word, I'm done with this discussion.

PS:  Summoner of Pets -- Couldn't you get the same excitement from going to any new zone?  The first time I see any new monster I think it's pretty neat.  People can still see giants in other zones, even named ones.

I have to agree with Cerpicio. Even with PoK books you can still have fun in the game. Personally, I love the PoK books; fast, effective, and productive. Ive played a druid to 56 (started him long before PoP came out). The books didnt bother me in anyway. In fact, I was happier. No more spam from strangers asking for ports while I am trying to xp or quest. Finally some peace. If you dont like the books, dont use them. Walk or use your self ports to get around. But we all know, even if your druid or wizard, you will use the books to get where you want to go faster, if the locations is closer then what your ports can get you, of course.  
      Although I do not play my druid anymore (quit at 56) I do know alot about them. I now happily play my 62 Necromancer /flex. Well, I suppose my point is to not complain. No one cares to hear your complaints, especially if you dont have your facts together. Just accept the changes, dont buy the expansion, or just quit. I wish you luck.
