I recently have installed the ruins of kunark into my new (slow) computer.  But to get to the point reason i am on a new computer is our old one was in a flood and was lost along with the cd case somewhere along the line i did come up with the cd and the books for the game.... when doing the registration after installing the game it asked for an account key code from the cd or cd case well i dont see one on the cd and as i said the case was lost in the flood.... is there a default code i can use to finish the registration or does anyone know what i can do to get a code?

Any and all help anyone can and does provide would be greatly appreciate and thank you in advance as well~!!

Long time since I installed anything from disc, but I always kinda thought the reg code only mattered when signing up or attributing an install to an account THE FIRST TIME...

...I could be wrong there, like I said...long time since I did an actual disc install..

but of you have an active account, and have paid for and previously registered your expansion(s), then all you should need to do is log on...

If (s)he ever installed RoK prior to this, the account is "branded" with the cd-key and it is never needed again.

However, if (s)he did not install RoK on that old machine, then it will ask for it.

Sorry, but it's on the case...you are pretty much SoL.  I would advise buying Everquest:Evolutions.  It costs aroudn $20, I think (if not less), and contains everything from original EQ through Luclin (SoL), IIRC.

That is exactly what i told my fiancee (who i am trying to get this working for) and he said that when he had initially tried to set it all up he had no credit card and at the time his mother wouldnt let him use hers for fear of him not paying.  Now we have our own and are able to set it up just cant find the code for the game after losing the darn case!!! i know there has got to be a way and the eq technical support i think NEVER reads their email.  Thank you very much for your reply Anya as i totally agree with you and i just wish it were that easy :)

Well i didnt mean to be rude and not thank you Nosferatu but i just realized there were more then one posts there.  I appreciate your advice i think i will give the tech support another day or so to take 2 minutes and read my email n respond and if i then havent heard i will buy a new one for him.  Just seems assinine to me to purchase a new one till i know if he likes it!! (if ya can understand that) not sure if he will like it but all the guys at work are telling him to get on here and get it installed so not sure if he is doin it cuz he wants too or for them was my theory before buying a new one but thank you very much for your time it is greatly appreciated.

If you only have the standard EQ and Kunark...it is truly worth it to go buy Evolutions.  You get MUCH more and it's really not that expensive.
