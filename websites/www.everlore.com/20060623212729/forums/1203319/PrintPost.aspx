Im ready to start up again. I havent played Eq in a lil over 1 year. I had personal bussiness to attend. But this point is im back. And i think im going back to RZ. Guys i havent been on in awhile and i need some briefing on whats goin on before i start back up. What are the major changes after POP.  I am an old member of FLOWERS OF THE DARK.....and the PINT SIZE CLAN.... I am not sure what i am gonna start up if my chars are gone. Previously i had a 47-iksar SK, 34 Halfling DRU, 29 Troll SK, and my favorite 60 Iksar MNK.  

I was loading my first CD today the Kunark Expansions , to get started back up so i could get starteed on some patches. It wont work. Still remember my code from kunark and still have my Luclin cds and everything but i dont wanna haveta buy another kunark. Does anyone think they could help me out?  I would be forever in ur debt if someone could sell there old disc for cheap or maybe gear and pp if i can get my account going again. I will pretty much do whatever i can to atleast get the Kunark disc, like i said i have luclin still. my email is parkerpiper@hotmail.com i thank u for informative responses. I know i will probably haveta buy the CD but thought i might atleast try looking here among EQers first. Thank u all for consideration.

Maybe you could buy EQ Evolutions for about $25-29 and get all expansions to date except for LDoN and the new GoD?

Yep, it's all those old school expansions for $30 or less.  Of course after you install it from cd there's still quite a bit of downloading before you can get into the game again.  

Lost Dungeons of Norath was the the most recently released expansion that revolves mostly around group level instanced dungeon crawls from levels 20+.  There are four different types of missions you take on with your group and you get your own private zone to play in.  As you win missions, you get adventure points that can be used to buy some pretty sweet stuff (similar to guild point systems but without the requirement of being in a guild).  It's good experience and good cash bundled into 90 minute timed missions (well more if you count group setup and splitting).

Gates of Discord is shipping in February.  Seems to be aimed at levels 50+ and uses a little bit of the instanced zones concept.  Highlights include new AA's, a tribute system, and a new class, the berserker.

I started the game shortly after Evolutions was released, so I'm one of those spoiled newbs that never experienced the old world when it was new.  I tip my hat to all you veterans though, I can't imagine the difficulty of the game years ago compared to now.

Had an old friend that was sorta in the same spot, he had played, then quit for some time then wanted to start up again. Loading the game was first.. now because you used the key for the game previously there is no need to register the code..  Loaded the game, had to go to the accounts tab and resign up.. all that really was needed was his sony station name and his password. If you dont remember those you will probably have to go through support. Lets hope that all your characters are still there. My 2 cp
