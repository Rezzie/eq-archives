Things I've read out of official text--
(any edits of mine are in parenthesis)

Strength: `Physical Strength`; affects:
1) how much you can carry
2) how much melee damage you deliver to a target
3) how fast you learn some (offensive) skills

Stamina: `Health and Constitution`; affects:
1) maximum number of hit points at each level

Dexterity: `Coordination`; affects:
1) how much damage you deliver with a bow/thrown weapon
2) time between attacks
3) how fast you learn certain skills
4) how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark

Agility: `Physical agility`; affects:
1) your probability of being hit in combat
2) how much damage you take per hit
3) how fast you learn some (defensive) skills

Wisdom: affects:
1) how fast you learn specific skills.
2) maximum mana at each level.

Ranger Statistic Modifiers:
+5 Strength, +10 Stamina, +10 Agility, +5 Wisdom

Questions I have about Ranger statistics--
1) Does Strength, in any way, affect the damage output of a ranger-wielded bow?
2) Does Agility, in any way, affect the speed or haste of a ranger-wielded bow?
3) Does Agility have any effect on a ranger's offense of any kind? Can it be considered a 100% Defensive Statistic?
4) At low-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?
5) At high-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?
6) If "attack" is the most important statistic, does this mean Dexterity is the reigning king of ranger statistics? or rather, is it Strength? or possibly, a comination?
7) If one asked you to assign the following choices of statistics in the order--from highest to lowest--in which they are most relevant to a ranger's needs, how would you answer them?
Your choices of statistics to assign are:
"Stength" "Stamina" "Dexterity" "Agility" "Wisdom"

Thank you for reading this, and if you answered even one question, I bow to you.  Hopefully your wisdom

WARNING! 
/jerk mode on

You think you are the only one that's ever had these questions?  Everquest has been out for five years now.  There are tons of message boards and webs sites with answers to these questions.  FAQ-a-plenty.  Did you look around for the answers yourself?

Here's one site, probably one of the most popular for rangers: <A HREF="http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/index.php" TARGET="_BLANK">http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/index.php</A>

There the have a specific forum called Skills and Stats.  The very first message is "FAQ Thread - READ THIS BEFORE POSTING QUESTIONS".

Under stats are the questions "What effect does DEX have?" and "What affect does AGI have?"
A1: <A HREF="http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=11898#FAQDEX" TARGET="_BLANK">http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=11898#FAQDEX</A>
A2: <A HREF="http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=11898#FAQAC" TARGET="_BLANK">http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=11898#FAQAC</A>

And a follow-up link:
<A HREF="http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=121" TARGET="_BLANK">http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=121</A>

And a discussion on ATK:
<A HREF="http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=9616" TARGET="_BLANK">http://69.93.210.2:8080/ranger/showthread.php?threadid=9616</A>

There are plenty of other threads there too, dicussing similar questions.

The internet is a vast resource of information.  Pull up Yahoo or Google and try a little seach on "EverQuest Ranger" and see what you come up with.


-- C.



Oh yeah, /jerk mode off
Enjoy your new ranger!

Given all the errors in that list of affects of stats, I question how "official" the text you found was.  The poster before me though gave you some good links.  Unfortunately the Glade has just changed sites, so some of the links inside Vlad's post (hes a paladin btw, but good with numbers) to other Glade threads won't work, but the search feature on the Glade is satisfactory.


<i>"2) Does Agility, in any way, affect the speed or haste of a ranger-wielded bow?"</i>

No.


<i>"3) Does Agility have any effect on a ranger's offense of any kind? Can it be considered a 100% Defensive Statistic?"</i>

Agility is, according to SOE, one of the statitics used to determine your Endurance pool, so technically, it could be used for Offensive power (Trueshot), but otherwise, yes, its primarily a defensive skills.


<i>"4) At low-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?

5) At high-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?"</i>

Because the Sta to HP ratio is so small, its generally better to go with pure HP gear than Stamina gear when you are starting out, unless you are trying to decide between a +30 Sta item, or one with +5 HP.  As you level, and the quality of your gear increases, that switches.  You just need to periodically check by removing a pure Sta item and seeing how many HP you lose to figure out the ratio.


<i>"6) If "attack" is the most important statistic, does this mean Dexterity is the reigning king of ranger statistics? or rather, is it Strength? or possibly, a comination?"</i>

The "most important" statistic is going to change as you level and your gear changes.   Attack is good, but it has a hard cap for worn gear.  Stats are good, but they all also have hard caps.  Resists are good, but again, have hard caps.  AC, HP and Mana are good, and don't have any hard caps we have seen yet.  Focus items are nice, etc.


<i>"7) If one asked you to assign the following choices of statistics in the order--from highest to lowest--in which they are most relevant to a ranger's needs, how would you answer them?
Your choices of statistics to assign are:
"Stength" "Stamina" "Dexterity" "Agility" "Wisdom""</i>

It depends on your target levels/play style, but those stats in general don't mean much.

1) Does Strength, in any way, affect the damage output of a ranger-wielded bow?

No. Higher DEX will yield higher damage with a bow.


2) Does Agility, in any way, affect the speed or haste 
of a ranger-wielded bow?

No. Only equipment and haste buffs change the speed of your attacks (including bows). Equipment haste (the single highest of any you are wearing), Quivers (the weight reduction fo the quiver results in bow haste (lower appearant delay) the higher the weight reduction, the greater the benefit). Haste buffs (from enchanters, shaman, beastlors, procs or bard songs). Some high end bard songs will stack with other haste buffs).


3) Does Agility have any effect on a ranger's offense of any kind? Can it be considered a 100% Defensive Statistic?

In general it is defensive in nature (higher AGI yields a higher chance to successfully dodge, paryy repoiste attacks).


4) At low-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?
5) At high-end levels are Hit point modifiers more effective than added stamina, or vice versa?

See Fletcher's comments. In general, when choosing between HPs and STA, I stack to whichever pieces gives me the greatest number of HPs.


6) If "attack" is the most important statistic, does this mean Dexterity is the reigning king of ranger statistics? or rather, is it Strength? or possibly, a comination?

You can see your character's modified "attack" total. But that is the value as listed for the primary hand. That value changes based on skill, strength (up to the CAP) equipment bonuses and other attack buffs.

There is no show "attack" for archery. There are some threads where people discuss their tests etc. One thing that can be easily tested is that higher DEX yields higher possible damage (close to double possible damage when comparing undrer 150 DEX to 255+ DEX).


7) If one asked you to assign the following choices of statistics in the order--from highest to lowest--in which they are most relevant to a ranger's needs, how would you answer them?
Your choices of statistics to assign are:
"Stength" "Stamina" "Dexterity" "Agility" "Wisdom"

Strength: comes on a lot of your gear and (especially later) there are lots of strength buffs avalable. This is generally the easiest to max. Benefits are carry more, 1 to 1 increase in attack value until you reach your CAP. It helps at lower levels, but if you are twinked / leveling fast, I would not worry about this stat.

Stamina: generally the hardest statistic to raise as a ranger. Stamina = HPs until you hit your cap (255 for below level 61) and more HPs are always good, but as mentioned it is more important later than earlier. If you plan on taking on roll as tank, then this is a stat you need to get capped.

Dexterity: this is important if you like and want to use archery. Lower level archery is not nearly as effective as the Alternate Advancement ablities later, but I used it a lot as a soloing tool. If you are going to use archery I would suggest getting as much DEX as you can.

Agility: helps rangers avoid damage. Id you plan on tanking, the combination of high AGI and defensive AAs are the route you want to take.

Wisdom: is the stat that is used to determine the size of your mana pool. More WIS = more mana, but in my opinion this is more of a nice to have stat verses the must have stat. There are plnety of pieces of equipment available now with nice WIS as well as having HPs and the other more desirable stats.
