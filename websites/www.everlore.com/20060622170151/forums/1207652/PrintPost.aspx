Greetings and well met travelers of Norrath, my name is Sidrak Kirdas a former Wizard of the 31st Circle. I played on Solusek Ro for over a year and a half, one time member of the Erud's Elite , all you EQ old timers out there should remember the guild. Anyhow, even though I know this board is rarely in use I do have some questions that I would like to post to the void and with hope I get a few responses... For starters, with the release of Lucilin did they finally do an overhaul on the graphics in the old world?? What is the current quality of the server?, aka is it still a descent one to play on, is lagging still a bad issue, have they finally started doing more gm events?, and finally should I even come back to Sol Ro when I reinstate my account, or should I take advantage of the new option to do a server switch?? Well thanks to all of you that consider responding ;) Good Day and Happy Hunting well met traveler,

Sidrak Kirdas
Wizard of the 31st Circle

ps. should I return to Sol Ro I will be looking to join a new guild so if any guilds need a new taxi or nuker gladly send tells in game or email me.

Righto.  I'm desperately newbie still (being slightly younger than the oldest Vah Shir PC) but I'll take a stab at the questions. . .

All information given applies to the original Everquest lands only.  Too low for Velious and too lazy to go to Kunark, I am.

Play Quality, Technical:

Luclin graphics are much cleaner and more detailed (Freeport doesn't look quite so much like a dive anymore), but some people hate the new character models.  Sol Ro only gives me, in GMT -5 (East Coast of the U.S.A.), linkdeath problems at 12:00 server time (GMT -8, West Coast of the U.S.A.).  A recent patch resulted in many more zones to desktop in the game population, but so far I haven't been affected.  Greater Faydark fluctuates between 50 and 130 people, East Commonlands from 20 to 80.

Play Quality, Roleplaying:

Flat out roleplaying is rare as hen's teeth (and the so-called "dumb races" are FAR in advance of their smaller, smarter brethren there), but outright /shout rudeness isn't very frequent either, and quickly gets chastised.  I've heard of four GM events in two months, and witnessed/participated in one (named griffons in West Commonlands).

Hoping this was helpful:

Tzimaoa, paladin of 15 seasons
"I'd rather be naked.  Plate itches."

Rydiarose, 8th level ranger (on standby)
(a willowisp floats by) "ooOOOOOoooo, shiny!"

Minta, necromantic child
"I made twelve explosions already!"

Legion of the White Rose, Solusek Ro
