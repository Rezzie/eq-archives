(Please don't flame me if you think this post sucks)

I know theres a few posts like this but I'm new here so I never saw them. I'm a lv 24 Ranger right now with most of the major (Chest and sleeves ,etc) armor pieces and love how much they drop off. But I notice that first I am bieng hit hard. I'm working on getting a full set of cheep upgrades. Second the xp is very poor here for me. I had a full group but I only got half a bubbel after a hour! Finnaly I get attacked. I know how to taunt well by Doting,snaring, and taunting, but so are the other SK's and Rangers too with higher damages and spells. BUT I get attacked. So my question is What kind of armor can I buy (about 100-50pp per armor and maybe a spefic weapon up to 100pp) and a question why I get attacked? This is my combo: DoT,Snare, and DD, and taunt. but other hybdrids do the same and do even more damage. But I get bullied. I have only played for a year and have no high lvevels yet. I have lost 2 characters already a 17SK and 20 Druid but now with more expioerence and more confidents I made up to HPK. Now I need help before I lose him. I's sorry I wrote a long paragraph but I want to make sure any of you willing to help me please again don't flame me! I'm prety new to EQ and new to this site. Thanks for reading this.

To solve your agro issue, i'd recommend not taunting at all, since all taunt does is put you on the very top of the mob's hate list.  If you continue to get agro off of the tank, then stop snaring (unless it's your job in the group), DDing or Doting.  Hope this helps =)

One thing to check also is the delay of your weapons, if the main tank is using a slow two handed weapon, and you are using two very fast one handed weapons, you will probably pull the agro every now and then.  As for the rest I would go with Mathezar's suggestions, though DDing and Doting should be fine if you let the mob get to 70%hp before you start.  This gives the tank plenty of time to build up agro and keep it.

If you don't want to be the one getting hit....

1) Stop using the Taunt button.  The only time to use Taunt is when you want to be hit.

2) Don't cast more than 1 snare per mob, unless that snare was resisted.  And if there is another ranger that higher in level that is supposed to be the one getting hit, let him Snare.  If you have an SK in the group, ask if he is using Darkness, and if so, let him use that instead of you using Snare.

3) At 24th level, the only DOT you have Flamelick.  Stop using it.  Its a spell purely for getting aggro, since at your level, the AC debuff on it is meaningless, and the 20 points of DOT damage is too low to matter compared to casting time.

All of the above is good advice, but let me add to it.  Don't snare right away, wait till the mob is under 50% or maybe even 30% or 20%.  Snaring something while the melees have it engaged isn't going to help much, you just want to make sure it is snared before it starts running.

There are exceptions of course.  If you are kiting, then you obiously want to snare it asap.  But you said people were getting hit, which doesn't happen much if you are kiting, so I doubt that's your tactic.  

If the casters are always getting agro, an early snare could help.  The main tank will have a more time to taunt before it gets to the caster.

And let me stress it again...do *not* taunt unless you *want* to get hit.  That's all it is good for.  If you are trying to get a mob off a caster, taunt away.  But if the mob is already on the group's tank, let him do all the taunting.



-- C.

Also, you never say where "here" is that you are getting crappy XP.  PC maybe?  If so then yes, time to move to a new zone.  Try Marus Seru, or HHP/HHK, and maybe even Dawnshroud Peaks in another few levels.

And you never mentioned what equipment you currently have, so we can't easily suggest upgrades.  Off the top of my head, for 2hs, Weighty Polearms have been pretty cheap lately and have a good ratio.  For 1hs ... the only thing that comes to mind is centi shortsword, but I think they are a few hundred.

You have "most of the major armor peices?"  Does that mean you have slots with no armor?  If so, then I'd make that your number one priority.  Fill in missing slots before upgrading existing armor.


Best of luck, and enjoy being a ranger!

Thank you for your advice I'm going to HPK right now. I hope I can get more money to buy a full set of new armor and a centi short sword. I learned when to use spells for Rangers. Thank you for all your advice I know this will help me. Good Luck to you all and thank you so much.
