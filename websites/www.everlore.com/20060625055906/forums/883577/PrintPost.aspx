I realize this may not be the best place to ask, but I've become frustrated with the bugs I've ran into while trying to sign up for the Steel Warrior boards. Anyway, my guild is intending to raid Nagafen's Lair in the near future, and I'm very much intending to participate - I'm level 52, have Evasive Discipline, am decently-well-geared, and dual wield two proccing weapons (Snowchipper and Frostbringer) perfect for taking on the great Nagafen himself. Now, while I've been playing Everquest since September, 2000, and been playing my warrior 95% of that time (if not more than that), I don't really have much experience in raiding. As with class knowledge and general Everquest knowledge, I know quite a bit about it even without having experienced it (I devour as much EQ knowledge as I can, talking to many high-levels, going through many big forums, etc. - and just plain experience in playing the game). Anyway, I figured it would be most beneficial to ask you grizzled veterans of raiding how exactly I should prepare myself for Nagafen. Here's my notes/questions:

- My resists vary from 30s to 60s unbuffed (42-ish fr and 65-ish mr) - is this enough for Nagafen, factoring in the summoned Elemental Blanket, the Resist Fire/Resist Magic buffs, and the Bard Songs that add to resists, and possibly the Resistant discipline, all of which should be present at the raid? If not, what would you suggest for resistances that would be cheap and easy to acquire?

- As you likely know, the Resistant and Fearless disciplines are both on the same timer - which should I use? Of course, +20 to all resists helps tremendously against Nagafen's numerous detrimental spells, but I've heard his AoE fear is likely his most damaging overall. Your thoughts?

- I currently have around 2350 HP unbuffed and 975 AC unbuffed - is this enough to successfully tank Nagafen, factoring in the Discipline "Evasive"?

 Comments would be appreciated.

 - Zanakus

Use Fearless, if you can time it right.  Resistance isn't really all that great.  Though, your resists are fairly low. If you can afford FR gear, do so.

It's fairly simple - make sure you get healed as much as Naggy damages you. :) (I'm joking)

Maintain aggro as best as possible.  Don't call assist right away.  Wait until you are sure you've done so much damage, that no matter what happens you'll keep aggro.  There's no formula for this.  It's just something you learn.  As a Paladin, I can pretty much call assist from the getgo, because I can keep aggro with no problem (or, worse case scenario, get it back in 1.0 secs).

Good luck and don't get too upset if you wipe.  First time raiders on a dragon don't tend to make it.  Listen to your raid leader...chances are, they've done it before and can give you hints.

You really need to improve fire and magic resists...get them as close to 100 as you can unbuffed. Otherwise his AOE spells will take you out.  Get Feared (MR) and you are useless as Naggy will begin chewing up the rest of the Raid force since you no longer have agro...Get Blasted by the Fire, and you are a roasted tank faster than the Clerics can heal you.

The Naggy raids I was on, the MT Engaged and didn't call for assists from melees until Naggy was at 80%.  Nukers joined in at 60%....and Nukers have to be in Melee range to land a spell.

Kalandr you're a moron, get your facts straight before posting here.  52 is the limit, any class can participate up to lvl 52.  This is why lvl 52 tanks with massive AA investments are the most sought after tanks for Naggy and Vox raids and often lead them.

I would work on your resists  because that is the only hard part of the battle -- getting feared and running into stuff you don't want to. You should buy some easy resist gear, since you will need it later on in higher end raids. Nagafen doesn't hit hard at all and doesn't have alot of hps either. On my server a 52 Warrior, 65 shaman and 65 cleric killed nagafen. The warrior did ALL the damage the the cleric healed and shamn buffed and what not. Though the Warrior was twinked beyond belief somewhere around 4k. So I would recommend using 'Fearless' instead of evasive or resistant. I went on a Vox raid around 48 or so and was around 2.3k as well and I did fine. If the clerics know what they are doing you will be fine.

Sorry, but that's not possible.

The moment a heal lands on the warrior, the healer is placed on Naggy's (or Vox's for that matter) hate list.  If anyone over level 52 gets on their hate list, they are instantly ported (IIRC) out of the zone - or at least, far away from the dragon(s).
