If you mean Wu's fighting gear it is more of matter of coin (pp) then level unfortunately.

It would be nice if Monk's could make these items at about a lvl they can use them but I think with the bazaar and the availability of cheaper items making these probably does not make sense.

However this is all speculation as I do not have a monk and am not sure what compairable items cost.  But I have seen the Wu's stuff running for 20 to 50 pp in the bazaar, it will cost you MUCH more than that to make it yourself.  A lot of that cost is getting to the stage where you can make it.

Their are better guides but the Wu's Fighting gear recipies are

pattern       (&lt; 1 gp)
viscous mana  (~ 7-10 pp bought from a chanter)
4 heady kiola (~ 1gp if you make them ~4pp if you buy)
  2 kiola sap, 1 water, 1 bottle, 
  mid 40's brewing skill
1,2,3 silk swatch(s) (depending on pattern)

The tailoring skill needed is in the 135 to 155 range so you will probably need to go the crystalline silk route or medium pelt route to get that high.

For me the problem was silk, it was expensive to buy in the bazaar and very tedious to get myself.  I had good luck collecting crystalline silk in the crystal caves but it was still slow going.

Wu's armor is silly. However, I have heard that many monk armor pieces are very expensive.

I can tell you that I have finally made it to 158 in tailoring and I hope to never make another piece of Wu's armor again. :)

Azzara is right. If you choose to make it yourself, you have to spend a lot of time and money to get your tailoring to that level, and then making the Wu's armor is not cheap either. I farmed the silks myself and made the Kiolas myself and even made a level 12 chanter to make viscous mana for me and I still spent too much of my own money, not to mention many hours making those stinking kiolas.

Anyway, my advice......get some cash and buy something in the bazaar that is better than Wu's.


Wizard of the 57th Circle of Knowledge.
Bard of the 51st silly song.
Beasty of the 25th soloing level.
Shadow Knight of the 8th level of Evil.
12th level maker of viscous mana (Enchanter)

Being and Erudite, I had this silly notion I would tailor my own: Robe of the Tempest

Probably 1K pp later (and that was farming my own spider silk and crystalline silk and making my own heady's) I am at a skill of 136.

I thought about making a chanter for the purposes of making the viscous mana but I came to the conclusion it just was not worth it.  The components cost 5pp so it was worth it for me to pay 7pp (usually) and not have to lvl a chanter to lvl 12, get the spell, then buy the pearls, then cast the spell which is a 200 mana hit which slows you down.

Skills in EQ are tedious, there can be a decent reward for a few items, but for the most part you can buy MUCH better for MUCH cheaper (considering the cost of raising your skill).  They need to rebalance things a bit, still make it worth while but avoid abuse.  Chasing around little spiders around at lvl 49 is silly but paying 5 to 10 pp PER silk is also out of whack.

Instead of wu become a human at Qeynos. Besides tunic (It requires a shadowwolf paw) all of the armor is easy and has nice stats. It has sta and str. The AC is preety good and as a newb I had descent 100+str and sta, 90+dex,85+ agi. These are newbie armor so there will be much better ones and All I had was a fine steel ulak.

To the above post...which armor do you refer to.  I made a human monk, he is lvl 4 in Freeport right now, thought about getting rid of him and making an Iskar(just because they have a low lvl armor quest). But I am up for the idea of makin a human over in qeynos if they too have a low level armor quest.
