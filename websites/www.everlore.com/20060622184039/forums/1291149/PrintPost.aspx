Valor Reborn has several seats on it's Executive Council open. We are looking outside of guild for new leaders so we might learn more and gain from others experiences. We have offered these positions within guild first but many players due to RL issues could not commit to become an officer in VR. Please visit our website at WWW.Valorreborn.org and read our charter. We are a very democratic guild with a sound charter.

If you are not interested in being a leader we are always looking for more good players to add to our family. Feel free to send tells to Wrathian in game. 


Here are the prerequisets for guild leadership:

-Council members will lead and organize one raid per month. This will not be an impromtu raid. It must be a formal guild raid posted on Everquestraids.com and the guild web site. Only properly promoted raids will count. 

-Council members will be expected to help recruit and find new talent to help build the guild.

-Council members will need to visit and post on the guild message boards (Guild Web Site: www.valorreborn.org)) on a regular basis. This means responding to other posts and creating new threads.

-Council members will make every effort to attend guild meetings and guild promotional events such as Buff Heal Stations, and socials. We do not leaders who are only interested in doing raids for themselves, they need to be willing to organize raids for others and varying levels.

-Council members need to be willing to give to the guild without regard for one's own self interest. Leaders need to understand that a large part of leadership is helping others.

We need to know that leadership cares about the guild and is willing to do what it takes to ensure it's survival.
