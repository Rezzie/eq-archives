i was just wondering how are warriors fun to play

nothing against all you warriors out there but i find it extreemly boring to play warriors.
and mayby its just me but i don't really see many advantages that they have other then high defence.

P.S. this is not meant to effend anyone. i just want positive input on you warriors

Sometimes you just want to go out and bash stuff.

shrug

Not every class is meant for every player.  The Nice Dwarf started out life on Norrath as a bearded warrior maiden.  Later, we decided for more hair and went with a Vah Shir warrior.  The Vah Shir has no worry for her own life and just wants to kill everything that moves.

I agree with the just bashing things and with a warrior all you have to do is hit the mob.  There are no worries about not having enough mana, or missing a note or a seeing a spell resisted or interrupted, simply the pure joy of crushing, slashing, piercing, bashing, kicking.  Seeing a critical hit is always fun
even though by the 30's you really need a healing partner unless you like loads of downtime to play Gems.

<i>I agree with the just bashing things and with a warrior all you have to do is hit the mob</i>

There's a little more to it.  A warrior's main role is to stand in front of the mob and take abuse.  You will not be the main damage producer.  You are also responsible for keeping your casters safe...without them you won't last too long.  When you are the puller you have to make sure you pull smart, over pull and you risk everyone's life.  

I like being a warrior.  I have other classes, but I like the feeling of being in the thick of it and holding aggro.  Sometimes that can be a challenge.  When you are high enough (30th I believe) make sure you use your shield to help a cleric or wiz that may have pulled aggro off you.  They will thank you for it.  Playing a caster is fun, but the medding bores me to tears.  Not to mention because I know how to play my warrior, it bugs me if I'm in a group and see a warrior not playing his class effectively.  It's fun to see your warrior progress with his hp/ac/atk and you have a full range of weapons at your disposal, plus almost any armor you want.

With that said there are a few drawbacks.  Sometimes aggro is tough to get and hold onto (this is something warriors having been begging to have fixed for awhile now), soloing at higher levels is near impossible, and on that note sometimes you may find your self LFG for extended periods.  It just depends.

That's my 2cp. :)

There's *much* more to being a warrior than just bashing things (LOL).  There are so many different abilities, and different ways to use those abilities.  Taunting isn't just about punching the button every time it lets you.  When you taunt is as important as the taunt itself.  Then you have other choices, like bashing or kicking.  Dual weilding, weilding a sheild, or using the so-called "ghetto bash" of swapping the shield in and out.  There's weapons choices, 2 hand for damage per hit or dual weild for hitting more often.  Do you want the weapon that hits for more or has a better proc or stats?  When do you use your Sheild capability and when do you save it.

I always played casters until I started my warrior earlier this year.  She is by far my favorite character to play now.  There's just so much to do in a fight, and nothing makes you feel better than standing your line and keeping aggro and dying so that the cleric can gate out to rezz your sorry warrior butt later (lol).
