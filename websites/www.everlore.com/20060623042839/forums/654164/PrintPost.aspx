Yes, while we're on the subject...Was just wondering on some good spots for a cleric/ranger duo.  

My cleric is just 3 blues shy of 51 and my friend has a ranger that will shortly be 50 and we find it difficult to find mobs that we can duo without me having to heal him to death.  He probably needs better armor, that goes without saying, just wondered if there's a zone that isn't too bad without needing a third person.

I don't have Sol, so those zones are out.  Is SolB the best option?  We've done DL and most mobs are DB or lighter now.  

Plus how do you start getting flags for the planes?

Ok, flame now.

Griz, try KC and SolB if you have to duo. My first suggestion would be open up the LFG tool and get yourself a full group. XP will come much faster to you than with the Ranger/Cleric Duo. Also, many other zones will be options with a full group.

As far as getting flags for the planes just get into raids when you can. If you are not in a guild that is working on planar progression this will certainly be more difficult for you but it can be done. At your level you probably won't be able to raid to heavily due to your level since many raids will have a level limit for "tag alongs".

However, you do have one thing going for you, you are a cleric. Many times raids are short on clerics or could always use more especially if you have your epic. 

If you are not in a guild that is working on planar progression you will just have to pay attention and be sneaky.Personally, I liked being guildless when I was doing most of my flagging because guilds started to know my name and I observed how well they raided. I really dodged some bullets and ended in the best guild on the server(for what I was looking for). Anyway,basically find out what guilds are doing planar flagging and find out who their guild leaders are. Add the guild leaders to your friends list, do /who all &lt;guildname(firstword)> and watch when people are forming up in PoT and planes zones. Eventually you will become very good at tracking raids. You will also learn when targets are killed and when they will be ready to kil again.

Goodluck.

Karnor's may be a bit difficult, depending on how camped and trained it is.  The Burning Woods is an ok zone, but the exp isn't that great.  SolB is decent, just be ready to handle adds.  Velks is a good zone to duo, if you can get an open camp.  Another great exp spot for your level is the enterance area of the Hole.  Some of these area may require some nifty root parking or the cleric to pacify.

If you haven't, I would have the ranger invest in a Swarmcaller.  If you do not have a weapon that procs a slow, this is definitely worth it.

As far as planar flags, you probably won't be able to get those started with those until you are in your mid to high 50s.  If your guild is doing a raid you can get in on, do so.
