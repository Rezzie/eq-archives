Hello all, I have a great thing to livin up this server.  Its the GREAT loot giveaway, a ne competition I have come up with.  I have a level 60 UBER DRUID with TONS OF PLAT but have started a lvl 3 human monk in freeport, yes he is human since i do not care for Iskars, no offense I just dont like lizards, LOLOLOLOL

Well, I am in the tunnel near shady on my other computer and the name is Shassnir, named after my battles with the shissar..

Well, he is naked. We all know about games of chance, and I have a GREAT ONE

Shissar is a poor monk trying to make his way n the world, he has had hard times since the dark elves took his family, he has to learnthe ways of the monk on his own.  It has been very hard but he is inspired by his name to go after the elves with furry anf anger to avenge all those betrayed and murderwed by the dark skins.  But, Shissnir is an orphan and cannot battle alone or naked

So he calls upon his kin of good people in Norath to help him in his struggle, SO IF YOU ARE GOOD IN HEART and HAVE ONE SINGLE CARING BONE yuo will herlp him avenge his family and to defend all that is honest and good.....How do you do that yuo Say???

Shissnar is cold and lonely by shady , needing help.  Please help him, he needs LOOTS to help him start his quest, so please post here or send him a tell in game to help him avenge his family,  He needs a Shissar Head band, haste item (not a crappy FBSS) and some GREAT WEAPONS not to mention armor, and he knows many of you and wants to see who is kindess in heart to help this poor orphanmonk avenge his family, a Fungi Tunic would the the ULTIMATE proof that you are a caring soul and youwill be praised forever in game for tgat gesture of kindness and my druid willport you anywehere and pay you back later after I recieve the gifts of kindness and I will MAKE MY SURENAME to honor you when I get 20 so you and your kindness will be IMORTALIZED in all of Norath,

SO PLEASE good people,Help Shissar, no crapo loot wanted cause the dark elves will just take it, 

Shissnar will become the Server wide poster child of revenge and kindess and honesty and the sould that is the most help will be imortalized

So send me a tell in game of what youwill give me and give it to me, and Plat is accepted also---

THIS IS NOT BEGGING cause I have a story togo along with it...or e-mail me at ShadySpine@yahoo.com with the loots you will give me, let the fun begin

My name
Shissnar surname is (put your name here) if you are the kindess sould ifn Norath

P.S.  A fungi tunic is a gaurunteed winner of getting your name as my future surname

Wait, if you have a level 60 druid then why do you need stuff from us?

wow anyone stupid enough to fall for this is, is well, stupid. " I have a lvl 60 UBER druid " theres one give away! and he goes on to say, give me stuff and i will give you stuff back, another dead give away that he is an asshole. If you have such and "uber" druid, and such "uber" stuff, buy the shit!!! log on your druid with your so called "other comp" take him to bazaar, and leave him there selling the stuff! shesh, i have a feeling that theres a big hole with nothing in it inside your head.

This post is old, but I felt like flaming it anyway.

Never before have I seen such a disgrace on these boards. 

This long attempt at begging is revolting. I must say, I hope that you die many times. 1) You have no druid (maybe a level one) 2) You are a newbie beggar 3) This is such a disgusting scam it deserves to be deleted.
