The problem I have playing a mage is that, overall they offer very little to a group or a raid. About the only thing most 60+ level raids will require from a mage is CoH! Face it, as mages go we're not setup for high level raiding. Every supposed upgrade magicians have had from the expansions, is really stuff that's been added as an after though. These are ablilities that we should of had from the start. The spells that are bearly worth having are all 60th or higher, and tend to be far too specialized to be used often. (These spells need to have the level requirements lowered, IMO)

As far as the pets go, consider that any unfocused pet will be about 3 to 4 levels lower then the mage summoning it. (Hence it being the agro magnet from hell) Worst of all, we just don't have "a" pet, we have 4 different types. Each with their own abilities depending on the element they are summoned from, which sounds great in theory, but hasn't worked out very well in practice. Lets take the Fire pet for instance... It's modeled after the wizard, and can cast and buff as one. This would be very useful if it weren't for two things. The pet goes OOM after buffing / first 2 nukes, and jumps into melee agroing and dying rather quickly because it has nothing for hit points or AC. Makes me wonder what Verant / Sony was smoking to think this pet model would be a great idea?

Adding insult to injury, our epic just about blows! First off we have the hardest Epic in the game bar none. Second, most guilds will not assist a magician with their epic's, as it offers nothing to improve the overall strength of the guild. Sure the pet is great, as long as your fighting mobs &lt; 60th level, and you don't have any of the post 60th level pets. Beyond that it's ends up being the "Back-up pet", as most mages I know won't use them without a focus item.

Lets not even start me on pet weapons...!

The really sad thing is, I have to 2'Box my 65th mage with a 56th cleric, to keep up with a beastlord of the same level! (Not considering AA's and gear)

Overall, I believe mages need a major overhaul to be a worthwhile class with in EQ. Other wise, it's just a class to play as an Alt, not as a Main.

I believe a friend in SoU, Rolstin, would disagree with you.  He's a very good mage and almost has his epic done.  Yes it is hard, but he has all but 1 crown (Air I think is the one he hasn't got), but that's because his guild doesn't have the man-power for the 7th isle in that plane. 

Otherwise, he's more than willing to go toe-to-toe with most mobs. hehe  Basically the only thing he needs besides "fluffy" (his pet) is either a cleric or a druid to group with him.  (trackers please sign up here!)

You obviously dont play a high end mage and have never been on a high end raid. 

Mages put out crazy DPS in groups and raids. CotH is overrated IMO.  Also mod rods are invaluable on high end raids (encounters that last longer than 5 min).  They also summon great focus items that you dont have to pay 100k for. 

Either quit yer bitching or play another class if you cant hang.

I think it's OK if they want to rant about Verant because Verant means We rant.  So what if they can't spell or if they have some really big accent.  Let them rant and let the people who want to rant after Verant rant to their heart's content.  It's SOE now anyway so I don't see what's the problem with someone ranting about Werant or Verant or whatever they want to call themselves now.

dude you are a fool, yes at low lvls magis dont get many groups, but we are the best friggen dps in the game, and i realy wouldnt say that our epic is that hard, if your having trouble with quillmain just go into SK after patch or restart and it will be spawned, thats realy the only hard one, get a high lvl wizzy for phinny to zin pull him, neh`ashirr is a push over, and magi`pitasa you just need a group for, the rest of em are easy, besides captain rottgrime who you just need a mezzer to help with the agroes.. and to get the elemental crown of mastery you just need realy need the pp or start a plain of air raid. if every thing goes right and every thing drops.. wich isnt likely but if you work realy hard you can get it done in a week
