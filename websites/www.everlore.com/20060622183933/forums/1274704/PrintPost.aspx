It depends on whether you plan to level this character up to be able to get the materials for smithing themself, or are they just for doing the combines and another high-level character will farm for them.

I don't know why you would do the latter for smithing, so I will go with the first theory....

You have to choose between strength, intelligence and wisdom as your primary smithing stat. I use a wizard for trade skilling, but it is sometimes a pain to farm stuff from greenies because eventually, you need to take a med break. Also, smithing ingredients are sometimes heavy. So, I require weight reduction packs to carry ore and stuff. However, I do like the ability to AE nuke greenies. Although, later smithing components don't allow for that kind of killing either.

Also, you have to decide if you are going to do other trade skills with this character too. If you are going to do more than smithing, go with an enchanter. Good Int and Cha plus has spells required for jewelcraft and tailoring.

If you are just smithing, I would say a melee class with very high strength and decent charisma for lower costs and better sell prices.

As far as location, it doesn't matter with shadowhaven and PoK....smithing can be done using those two zones exclusively, besides farmed components.

Any other suggestions?.....I am curious what others think as well.
