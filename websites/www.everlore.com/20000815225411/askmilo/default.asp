Milo D. Cooper is the man behind the models. Most of the 3D characters from the strong and hardy Dwarves, 
to the elegant and graceful Elves, and even the rare and powerful Dragons of EverQuest; all of which 
were beautifully produced by Milo's skilled hand. As such because of Milo's excellent work in EQ he's 
become highly respected in the 3D Modeling industry.</p>
<p>
Milo is the 3D Character artist at Verant Interactive, and he allows us to ask him a barrage of 
questions, about the models in EverQuest to character modeling in general. So if it's 3D and you want 
to know something about it, this is the guy to ask. There are a few guidelines to look over BEFORE you 
send him a question though, please read these over carefully.</p>
<ul>  
<li>No "I wanna work at Verant" stuff.
<li>No "I wanna play Barbie with my character" stuff.
<li>Look around a bit to make sure your question can't be easily found else where.
<li>No questions about his underwear.
<li>No "help me, the game won't run properly on my computer" questions.
</ul>

If you have a question for milo email him at <a href="mailto:askmilo@everlore.com">askmilo@everlore.com</a>. Also 
from time to time Milo has a guest host from Verant field a question or add a comment, like Rosie Cosgrove 
or Rick Schmitz just to keep you on your toes. Milo also LOVES to pick on bad spellers so run your email 
through a spell checker a few times before clicking send, consider this your fair warning. ;)<br><br>

 Hello Milo,<P>

          I've played Online games for quite some time I feel in love with huge multi-player games. (like EQ, Ultima Online) Where UO failed to keep me hooked EQ has succeded. Iksar add on was a great Idea, and the graphics are just stunning. I've been thinking about how EQ would be better and where it occured to me. Even though the Iksar are a great idea, what about adding another race in the future. That are like the iksar, but realated to the dragons... I read that little intro to the begging of that dumb little book that game with the kunark exspansion.<P>

 What if, now roll with me here, the dragons in an attempt to regain something, whatever, created a new race of  dragon men .  EQ has every great thing a game needs, Role Playing, Semi-Evil villians, fare maidens, and goofy dwarfs. Now this new race would be the scourge of the whole eq world, like the iksar. However, the special thing of these they would have a new class specifically suited for these mandragons :) Also, like the iksar who start with 100swiming what if this new race has a new skill called glide? or Fly? those alone would open up whole new adventures. Being able to have a whole dungeon in the skys opening up a great new experiance. The new class could be like demonicism (sp) . The story could be like, the dragonmen rebeled from the dragons and escaped and started a new city in the skys. Where they created a new religon of a type of satanism? Where as the necros have their skeletons. These guys could have their deamons? whatever? Its your game. Just something that I thought would be fun to see and play in the future. I know you guys dont have the time/resources. But maybe at your next staff meeting bring something up about another new race for next year. (too keep bussines up, so you can all have nice big red sports cars). Just a dream I had thanks for even reading it. Great work all around. <P>

 Dear Milo,<P>


     I dont know if anyone has asked you this question but do you have a everquest character of your very own. I have a necromancer and a shaman. I dont know if you have one or not but i would be glad to  see your own character on the tallon zek server because that is the server i am on all
the time. If you have a human necronacer that is high level I would be glad to get some tips from you. If you can since  love dragons alot can you draw
me a picture of veeshan the crystalline dragon and ruler of the plane of sky?
I must go now I have high hopes that you e mail me back. Have a great day :) :) :)<P>

   Hello, Kristina.  Yes, I do have an EQ character of whom
I've grown rather fond: she's a gnomish wizard.  Until
recently, I haven't been able to play her, but now that I've
had to format my hard drive and re-install Windows 98,
I'm able to play the game again, so I might again step
into her shoes from time to time.  I won't reveal her name
or the server on which I play her, for obvious reasons.<P>

   As for drawing a picture of Veeshan, you can understand
that I don't do requests, but if I ever get the urge to do
something like that, I'll probably put the picture on my web
site, somewhere.  (<a href="http://www.milospace.net/">http://www.milospace.net/</a>)<P>

 Hey Milo..are you going to talk about EQ or are you going to act smart and talk about grammar all damn day. You are a pixel pusher, and having worked in the game industry for 6+ years I know your not talented enough to be such a condescending jerk.<P>
 
 The art in EQ is acceptable...that's it...nothing more and nothing less. Get off your high horse.  You make me NOT want to support Verant any longer.  Id had a guy like you working for them..Paul Steed...he got fired recently..lets hope Vertant follows suit.

 Since i have yet to see this question asked, I feel obligated to ask it. If every employee at Verant had a huge brawl, who would be the winner? I imagine it would be either you or Brad McQuaid since you both sound hardcore.

   That depends on the nature of the fight.<P>

   Physical brawl: Tony Garcia or Vu Nguyen.  Tony practices bodybuilding,
and Vu is well experienced in martial arts.<P>

   Intellectual brawl: Some programmer.  My money would be on Roger
Uzun, but there are also John Buckley and the illustrious Brian Hook to
consider, among others.<P>

   Creativity brawl: Rick Schmitz, EQ's chief character designer and
animator, or Bill Trost, EQ's senior game designer.  I would hate to
get into a fight of imagination with either of these guys.<P>

   I haven't mentioned Brad because any fight he'd be in wouldn't be
fair.  He's the company VP; you always let the wookie win.<P>

      I have always enjoyed listening to all types of music - from
bluegrass to grunge to speed metal. Of late, I've gotten more into Jazz. My
main source of it is on NPR. The only Jazz CD I actually own is a Louis Armstrong compilation featuring many of his most well-known hits.<P>

      What is a good source for finding out other artists, be they Jazz mega-stars like Billy Holiday and Louis Armstrong, or fairly unknown types only listened to by afficionados?<P>

 Also, I imagine there are different flavours of Jazz, as I haven't really found a radio station that plays Jazz I enjoy (other than NPR)...might there be someplace to go to learn more about this?<P>

      Thanks,<BR>
      --Mike<P>

   I don't care for Jazz, actually.  I've heard some very little that I
like,
but overall I never got into it.  My father played Jazz/Jazz-related
recordings a lot when I was a child, and my maternal uncle has always
been a very good Jazz saxophonist, but that type of music generally
just went into one of my ears and out the other.  I'm sorry that I can't
be of help to you.<P>

 My question is this.  There have been several posts by Gordon saying that the lack of models has something to do with the limitations of the Voodoo

 Hi Milo!  I never believed that starting this conversation would lead to such an interesting 'thread' so to speak.  However, I am glad it did

 I had to laugh at the indignant repsonses to your dismissal of Chris's irrelevant question. What makes me laugh even harder is that the question of level-caps on dragon raids had already been dealt with and was busy provoking a new and even loader uproar on the gameplay board that week.<P>

 Milo,<BR>
     I noticed that someone tried to correct your grammar by stating you used the word "whom" incorrectly; I found this quite entertaining. I am by no means a scholar of the English language. I, as you so eloquently put it, showed an incredible amount of disinterest when it came to education. On top of that, I am by far better with mathematics than I ever will be with the English language. With that said, I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the "correction" on the user of the word "whom" and the garble that followed. Using whom, as opposed to who, was entirely correct. I always seemed to think this was as common as knowing when to use lesser as opposed to fewer. Obviously I've been wrong. At any rate, my only real motive for posting this, besides to make someone look like a fool, was to agree with you on the point that people should at least have the decency to have a fair understanding of the language, as it reflects very badly on themselves, and generally makes communication more difficult, to not.<P>

     Also, to the person who had the audacity to state that programmers with bad grammar are lazy, you have a serious misunderstanding of a programmer(I would like to hope I do not being one myself, albeit not a incredibly knowledgeable one yet). Programming, is a form of expression that rivals all others. It requires you to learn at least one new language, though it is often more. You must master this language, to some extent, far more than any spoken language, and it is far less forgiving. I never have, nor will, find a greater outlet for my creativity and skills.<P>

 Ellegon<P> <P>



 The idiot with the argument against 'of whom are.'  You didn't rip the pompous ass up the way he so richly deserved.  When my daughter was in
high school she used to come home with questions like, "you know how you always taught me  blah blah?...Well the teacher says blah blah."  If she argued with the teacher (English was the teacher's second language for God's
sake!) the teacher threatened her grade.  So what did my daughter learn?  Power
in the face of ignorance is still power.  Did she learn any English?  Yes,
from me (not "from I").<P>

 Keep up the good work.  I have studied computer generated graphics and animation, and I am impressed with your work.  And your English.<P>

 I recently read your answer to a question concerning UO2 and was completely blown away.<P>

 I can understand you not liking the graphical style of the game, and can respect that you dont like it. That is fine. But, in all honesty, saying that "UO2 doesn't even look as good as EverQuest, in many ways" just makes me blink in confusion. Can you PLEASE tell me how EQ looks better. Even one example would please me.<P>

 The fact that you bash it's textures, "blocky" models, and non-next gen game look seems like bitterness on your behalf. EQ has huge, low res, pixelated textures(not to mention tiresome and repetitive), INCREDIBLY blocky character/monster models, and pretty lame character animation.<P>

 I'm sure you are aware that no MMORPG can ever have the quality of graphics as a single-player FPS. Afterall all, having dozens of super-smooth models and hi-res textures moving around on the screen at once would cause most up-to-date computers to chug.<P>

 For the record, bump-mapped, varied and colourful textures don't seem "non-commital" to me.

   I could very easily and very specifically name several ways in which
EQ has better graphics, but unfortunately, the intolerance of some game
players and industry "professionals" has made it bad business for me to
speak or write negatively of the game any further.  In light of this, I have

to the public.  While everyone seems to have his/her own version of the
"Perfect Game", I have found that Verant has done a damn good job of creating a thoroughly immersive environment with awesome graphics, superb character animations and models, and the best in-game support staff of all the
online games out there that I have played to date.  Having jumped the sinking
ship of the forerunner to the game you are no longer allowed to discuss due to threats to your manhood and personal wealth, and having also viewed the unmentionable pile of pixelated trash that is to be the graphics for said "unmentionable" product...I can only agree with your views.  I am sure as soon as it is released, all "da pimp masta sword butt stallionz" as they
call their online personas by name, that do their best to ruin all online games (but seem to live in larger numbers in said competitors online world, especially after in game support turns the lights off) with their moronic speech and actions, will no doubt also complain what trash it is, and pray that {insert competitor's parent company name and logo here} sends a team
of commandos to forcibly procure Rick Schmitz and yourself, to turn it into something worth looking at.  Having spouted off for the last 40 paragraphs without actually making some kind of point...I leave it at this. YOU ROCK!<BR>
 Now for my Questions...<P>

 1.)  Having read through some of the emails sent to you, I have to
ask...Do the veins in your head ever threaten to pop out and explode from the sheer volume of morons out there?  Furthermore, Do you condone choking people
that obviously appear to need it?<P>

 2.)  If a troll was running backwards at the speed of light, and it
scratched it's big flea bitten arse would it explode? (I'm sorry...I really am,
having read some of the posts sent to you has really warped my mind, or as they would've spelled it "wrapped my monded.")  8-)~<P>

 PS  Keep being yourself, you sound like a man after my own heart.  I get accused of being mean natured all the time, simply because my tolerance
level for stupidity and ignorance have been decreased over the last 29 years,
(as have my grammar skills no doubt) and sometimes you just have to say what's
on your mind, and have to do it the "nicest" way possible...and it is SooooOOOooooOo hard not to add in those hidden slams that I have
ROFLMAO'ed over as I caught them hidden but in such plain sight in your replies. Oh
what a world this would be if there was a minimum IQ level to be allowed to breathe.<P>

 Yours truly,<BR>

   (1) Of course, and absolutely.<P>

   (2) That question is just *too* stupid for me to answer.<P>

   Thanks for your compliments, and for concurring with my appraisal of
the "unmentionable" software.<P>

    What modelers in the video game industry do you currently look up to, or respect for the work they've done on recent products? I thought the work on Quake 2, EverQuest, MDK2 and Bungie's upcoming game Halo are all excellent examples; they gave the models a personality and lifelike quality animation that very few other games can even come close to, and made those respective games that much more enjoyable to play. Anyway, would love to hear who you think does good work in your area of expertise.<P>

   Namco's Soul Calibur has very sweet character models.  Lots of polygons,
anatomically detailed, motion-captured movement, and wonderful hair and
clothing physics.  Imagine a MMORPG with graphics like that!  The next
Metal Gear game, developed for PlayStation 2, looks spectacular as well.<P>

   Actually, though, I think that it would be really neat to work on a 2D
game.
I love what Capcom's artists have done with their post-Street Fighter II
Super Turbo games; when I first saw Darkstalkers, I felt as though I was
actually watching an anime cartoon.  The graphics in Capcom's fighting
games are very vibrant and very exaggerated, just the kind of stuff I like
to
create.  Working on something like that would be a blast, and a nice change
of pace for me.  Oh, well!<P>

     First let me say that I love your models.  My character is a Wood Elf so when I'm fighting the Orcs in Highpass Pass, I have to tilt the "camera" up so I can see them.  I simply enjoy that I am fighting something that is a lot bigger than I am.  The sizes of the different creatures is amazing.  My hat is off to you.  Please pass on to the respective people, that the character animation and texture art are extrememly well done.  I love them too.  =)<P>

 My questions:<BR>
 1) Can you divuldge what software you use?  (Lightwave 3D, 3D Studio, etc.)<BR>
 2) Did you have any inspiration for your models like a movie or comic book or TV show?<BR>
 3) Do you have a bachelor's or master's degree in computer graphic art? If not, did you teach yourself?<P>
 
 Thanks in advance,<P>

   I'm asked these questions all the time.  I think I'm going to put an Ask
Milo FAQ on my web site, since people don't seem to want to use the
archives, here.<P>

   I use Maya and 3D Studio MAX (mostly).  My main inspirations are
the comic book art of Mike Mignola, Rick Schmitz's character designs,
and music in general.  I have had no formal training (beyond a few brief
classes on the use of Maya and PowerAnimator) in the field of computer
graphics -- so yes, I am self-taught.<P>

   I'm sure that Rick Schmitz (animator) and Rick Johnson (textures)
appreciate your compliments about their work.<P>

 Dear Milo,<BR>
     I would first like to congradulate you and thank you for taking our questions!  Personally, I think I play the game too much, and I think I'm
not the only one. =P<P>

 When you were a kid what did you want to be when you grew up? Being that
I'm still a kid, I have a lot of dreams.  The rest of what I wanted to say was pretty much covered already.<P>

 Sincerely,<BR>
         Phil

   As I child, I developed several ambitions.  Doctor, composer, writer,
husband
and father, architect, comic book artist, programmer, grandmaster chess
player,
film director, superhero... but never a computer graphics artist!  With the
exception of composer, I've given up on all of those things; life has pretty
much
narrowed it all down, for me.<P>

 Milo,<BR>
     Heya there.  I want to thank you on all your good information and stuff that you have provided to all us people (can't do grammer, go
 figure) who needed it.  Thanks =).<P>

     Now for my question.  If you, of all people, built charatacter modles (and monster modles), why do you use the same one for so many things?  Stupid leech things n Kunark that look like semen are used in over 5 different monsters.  Why?  And another one.  Goblins.  Fire, ice, aqua, and regular goblins are still the same, only different colors. Place the fire goblins head on fire or something.  Jesus.  Another question.  You people at Verant need to stress that fact that this is only a game =).  Seems to me whenever all kinds of people get pissed at me, I say it's a game, and they get even more pissed.  Why?  It's the truth, ain't it?  Cmon.  As one of the few female characters who are actually females, I feel that this should be changed.  My 2 copper.<P>
  
 I don't want to be sought out and raped, so I remain anon ;)<BR>

   What are these, trick questions?  Pass me that pipe.<P>

   I am not God.  I cannot bring a character model into existence merely
by uttering a magic word.  They take time to create, and when my bosses
want to put a few hundred different monsters in the game, well baby,
some geometry is going to get recycled.<P>

I have read a few of your answers Milo, and frankly I have to say that you must probably be one of the most cynical bastards around.<P>
 
 If you don't like people, then why don't you just quit "Ask Milo"?<P>

 Making jokes of people not being able to write decent English? Are you sure they even has English as their first language? What do you think a French would say about your language skills in his native language?<P>

 Making people feel like pricks because they write long letters, which they have invested a lot of time in?<P>

 Making fun about questions people think are serious enough to ask you?<P>
 
 I suggest that you don't answer the question if you don't like it. Don't make jokes on others, they might get hurt, and hurting people intentionally isn't very nice, is it?<P>

 And before you get sarcastic about my grammars, my first language isn't English.<P>

   (1) What have you got against cynical bastards?  By the way, get a
dictionary and look for the word "cynic."  It doesn't mean what you
think it means.<P>

   (2) On the contrary, a web page like this is the perfect place for
someone who doesn't like people!<P>

   (3) I've been to France, and I've spoken French to the natives (I've
had a few years of formal training).  They complimented me on my
(admittedly very rough) skills.  Mordez-moi, chienne.<P>

   (4) What does the length of a letter have to do with its value?  What,
all short letters are worthless?  Ten pages of crap is a gold mine?
Help me out.<P>

   (5) You know whose name I see at the top of this web page?
MINE.  If I don't think that a question deserves a serious answer, then
the person who asked it is just going to have to eat it and smile.<P>

   (6) I've tried to answer your last question, but I'm falling asleep at
the keybo....<P>
