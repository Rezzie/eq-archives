Hello. I am a level 15 Dwarf Cleric who is searching for a new place to call home. I know that I am still pretty young, but I have been leveling quite fast and I have played characters well past this level so I do know what I am doing. I am interested in concentrating on this one and making her my main.

I am looking for a friendly guild that I will be able to call home for a while. I am looking for a guild that does raid. I am not looking for a guild that has mandatory nightly raids. One or two mandatory a week will be fine. 

Please contact me while I am on Donamaria or email me at Shapeshifterdzs@aol.com

Thank you.

THE DESIDERATA
The Desiderata of Happiness by Max Ehlrmann (1948 and 1967)
Desiderata =  the sense of something missing, the thing desired,
- Oxford Concise Dictionary


Go placidly among the noise and haste and remember what peace there may be in silence. As far as possible without surrender be on good terms with all persons.

Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even the dull and ignorant; they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit. If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time. Exercise caution in your business affairs; for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself.

Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love; for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass. Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings.

Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the Universe; no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.

Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labours and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life keep peace with your soul. With all its sham and drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be careful. Strive to be happy.
