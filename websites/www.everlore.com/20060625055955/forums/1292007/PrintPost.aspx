All right, here's the deal...I've been playing EQ since before any expansions. I can remember when level 50 was the highest level. No epic weapons, except for the Paladin's. That was a long time ago. I left just before the release of Luclin. I don't have Luclin or PoP installed. It's a shame, really. My question is this, what is it about EQ that makes you guys still want to play? I played because at the time, it was one-of-a-kind. Sure there were other MMORPGs around when Everquest first made it's debut, but nothing imemrsed a player into a fictional world so well as EQ. But now, now there are plenty of options for the fantasy gamer. Don't take this post the wrong way. It's not a flame against EQ, and I don't regret any time I spent playing it. In fact, I credit EQ with providing me with coutless hours of enjoyment, an enjoyment that I could never find anywhere else. My name is Daekin Soulblaide. I am a level 51 Paladin on Rallos Zek. Answer me this, if most of us started playing EQ for the thrill of going on new adventures, why do we continue to play EQ when it is near impossible to adventure on ones own? Gaining experience or items of any worth require large groups. Shouldn't players have the option of grouping or not without getting left in the dust financialy or level wise? If this post seems like it's all over the place, that's because it's 3am and I'm a bit tired. I'm feeling the urge to come back (my character is still there, I checked recently), and I need to hear something positive from current players. I'm playing DAoC at the moment and have a level 43 Warden named Mythram Soulblaide on the Percival server. If anyone would like to offer their opinion on which game is better and why it would be much appreciated. No flames, just honest opinions.

P.S. Before I left EQ I gave the account to my kid brother who had never played before. He died and didn't tell me about it, resulting in the lose of all of my items, including a full suit of Valorium (probably not that good now) and whatever else I had. This is going to make my return to EQ even more difficult so let me know what I'm missing by playing another game, if I am indeed missing anything at all.

You agreed that it <b>was</b> one of a kind...Ok, so how do you explain the other massives? EQ spawn, thats how. Granted, most of us will leave when Planetside/SWG come out, but untill than; I don't think everyone ready to give up their chars that they've worked so hard to attain.

I started to play eq cause i was tired of the first person shooters out there. Tired of the Muds and the Ultima online crap. I wanted to try something new. So i started to play eq. I have found many friends on eq and i have found my goddess on eq. I would never leave even if there was a better game out there to play because eq is one of a kind when it comes to making the player feel that their charater is an extension of their being. Most online games pit teams against teams. but eq is one that promotes team work. that is my 2 cents. Do what you will with it.

Maybe you'd derive some enjoyment in running around and getting new stuff for your nekkid toon? There's an awful lot of stuff to do around the world(s)...also, I dunno what you're talking about as far as being left "financially....in the dust..."....the bazaar took care of that and you'll now be able to outfit yourself for a surprisingly low amount of plat.

...I've seen a few postslike this one lately where the theme seems to be that a person HAS to do something specific to "get anywhere". Well, first of all...you never HAVE to do anything you don't want to, and with new additions to the game there are opportunities to either group OR go solo and still get decent rewards/items...

Now, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that the game IS biased toward groups. Anyone who's been here for any length of time knows that...so there should really be no whining about that focus. It'll never change, and if that's the deal breaker, well, then happy trails to you and good luck!

I play both games, DAoC as well as EQ, and for me personally I like EQ better. Always have actually. DAoC was a neat diversion for about amonth for me...

...but, no one can tell you how YOUR experience is going to be....my experience has no bearing whatsoever on yours, so I can't help ya there. My advice....come back on for a month..try it out..see if it's changed to YOUR satisfaction, and make your decsion, long term, from that...

I've plaid EQ, AO, UO and oh Linage or some crap like that ... heheh 

EQ beets em all , I love the fact you can round up 40ppl and raid a dragon...  a god or any huge mob that makes news once you've downed him. 

AO was all nice and crisp... but it kinda ends there. 

UO was great, why ... one reason ownership. ( house cabin tower etc... ) 

Somehow I doubt we'll see another EQ ... perhaps EQ2 after a few months of patching will be worth getting into. 

( All this is only based on my little 3 yrs exp in MMORPG's though )

I too have played since before Kunark...and gave it up for a bit only to join a blue server and see the other side.  Unto you I ask...Do you remember the first time you saw Naggy brought down or how special it was when the hard work or period of waiting was finally over to get CPT Rubicite to drop his breastplate...These are "the moments" or the hook that brings me back.  Players have come and gone over the years just as they did when I play dungeons and dragons but it's "the moment" that I enjoy so much. 
As a cleric waiting for Bildge
As a lowbie warrior awaiting the froglok squire to spawn with fork in hand...
Not to be twinked, not to be powerleveled, but to achieve on my own.  You ask why it's worth it now if it requires uber guilds or levels to get the loot but I assure you that "the moment" is still out there.  Not having the latest gear will not keep you down when you group with good people.  Passing on a wealth of knowledge as a veteran player to the new, young, and sometimes foolish I now look to organizing groups to gain a net worth goal.  My guild "The Phoenix Legion" gathers together to help accomplish goals for one another.  We are by no means a superpower guild because real life takes precedence.  We don't raid huge places every night or farm planes but we gather to help one another.  Even now the newness of someone finishing their epic or completing something like Greenmist is "the moments" that make it still a wonderful game.  People will say that the mobs are canned and repetitive but Norrath has grown with new revamps to zones making for new challenges.  Please don't misunderstand there are a lot of incredible games out there other than EQ but for me "the moment" is all I need to stay in Norrath.

I have always believed that parents should get down on the floor and play with their children. My children grew up and no longer played on the floor so I got off the floor with them. We graduated to computers, positioned side-by-side in the same room. I struggled to keep up with my son in all the computer games we played. He was constantly leaving me dead or in the dust. I was frustrated trying to enjoy the experience. A friend from work recommended EQ. I bought the game and opened an account when my youngest was 15. The first few months he just wasn't interested. In fact the roles were reversed with my sons telling me to get off the computer. Ha! 

Then my yougest became more interested and began to play. My sons live with their father so they are here two or three weekends out of the month. I then opened a second account. And we were hooked. By this time I had gotten involved in a guild (no longer in existance but at one time it was one of the most popular and active guilds). But then when my eledest son was visiting at the same time mom was left in the background to watch them play EQ. That wouldn't work so I bought an account with a 51 Shammy and loaded EQ on my laptop. Now we are just EQ fools when we are together. My sons are now 18 and 21 and we don't threesome as much as we used to but at least two weekends out of the monthe you will find me EQing with the 18 yr old. 

Oh, and a year ago I took over the advisorship of the Gamer's Club at the college I work at. The Gamer's Club has monthly lock-ins. About 40 members attend these all night affairs. Many bring their own systems and join in the LAN. The computer game most often played is EQ. The members also play D & D, and Magic. The old lady advisor (that's me) has spent the night playing EQ, Vampire, or War Craft. 

Since the beginning I have built two computers for the purpose of being able to handle the graphics on EQ. When we are together we don't group with others because it leads to ackward moments. Since the three of us are in the same room we have no need to communicate on-line. After all, we are in the same room. It has lead to a couple of fights here though. When my eldest son felt that my youngest sons actions lead to mom's death or my youngest son didn't like the way the eldest was pulling. But for the most part we have a blast. Oh, did I mention that I am referred to as the "kick ass mom"?

I highly recommend EQ to other parents who want know the children and communicate with the. I have suggested several time to my ex that he should play something with the boys. But he is too much of an adult to stoop to playing on the floor. He has forgotten what it is like to be a kid. 

I play mostly on Cazic Thule now because most of the kids from school play on that server. We still occasionally play on TP but not often. If you are interested in seeing what characters we have on our three accounts you can check out my Character Stats page on my web site. Goe to my main page and follow the link to EverQuest. www.zoobecca.com

Now go, play and have fun.
It's listed under the EverQuest link on my main page.
