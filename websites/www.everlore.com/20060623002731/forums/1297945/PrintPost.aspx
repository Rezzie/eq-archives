this  post is going to be kind of long i know and the info for  it i got off of <A HREF="HTTP://www.monkly-buiness.com" TARGET="_BLANK">www.monkly-buiness.com</A>

 Well, it's done, and it's a doozy. The entry fee to get your monk FA is to be level 46, and to have done the whole freaking ROWF quest. To be fair, though, this is *exactly* what an FA quest should be. Due to needing a ROWF, the monk FA is going to be very very rare, but it builds on quests from level 1 on. 

Step 1: I wanna be a bookworm, yo! 

Get a Book of Immortals from any named mob in Skyfire and take it to Tomekeeper Danl in the Erudin library. Get faction, xp, and a reference from Danl. You also get told about Lhaeo. 

Step 2: The search for Lhaeo. 

In the hidden cove in Timorous Deep you will find Lhaeo. When queried he will give hints about the book of the Celestial Fists. To get this book you turn in your reference from Danl and your ROWF. The monks who first did this had balls of steel, no doubt. They did this on faith and desperation. 

Step 3: Bondage in Trak's Teeth. 

After receiving the book head over to TT. Somewhere in the vicinity of the OS tunnel, about the ruins, you will find a level 45 NPC named Kaiaren. When hailed he will act all whiney. When asked about the Celestial Fists he has something to say. Turn your book in to him and you get the same book back, and he gets unhappy with you. Just have an enchanter use blanket of forgetfulness on him and go see his true form. When you talk to the true form he will send you on a mission to destroy the fist of fire. Note: After a certain patch, you now have to turn your book in to get the Eejag quest, and the book you get back *is not* the same one you gave him before, so do not turn this book in to anyone other than the true form. 

Step 4: Come out, come out wherever you are! 

The fist of fire is named Eejag, and will come out if challenged. Time to round up a group and head to LS. Find the mob 'fire sprite' and say to it 'I challenge you, Eejag'. At this point Eejag will spawn and shout to the entire zone. If he's already spawned he doesn't shout, but he'll be there for you all the same. Eejag is in the lava pit by sol a, b, temple, so bring a porter with you. A well balanced group will have no problems with this fight if well prepared. Bump FR as high as you can get it, because you have to fight Eejag in the lava. The simplest way to do this is to have regrowth and a bard with you. Shaman casts regrowth, and bard plays whatever hp song it has. Tanks go under and beat Eejag up while nukers and healers lev up on the wall. When a tank needs a heal, swim to the surface and get one. Nukers only go under to cast then go back up. Eejag drops some scales. Take these back to Kaiaren's true form for directions on the rest of the quest, and the scales back. 

Step 5: Up, up, and away! 

Take the scales up to the Plane of Air. On Dojorn's island you will find 'a presence'. Hand the scales to this mob and Gwan will spawn. Gwan hits for 160ish, and the same group that took out Eejag will have no problems here. Fight Gwan away from the edge, though, as she procs a minor knockback and stun. MR will help here. Once Gwan bites the dust, get your Breath of Gwan and move on. 

Step 6: Hi ho! Hi ho! It's off to Earth we go! 

The next fist is Trunt, the Fist of Earth. His hidden form is 'a sleeping ogre' in the Mines of Nurga. Hand your breath to the ogre, and Trunt will spawn and immediately try to kill you. He hits for 176, double attacks, and hits fairly fast so you'll want a backup healer or a second cleric at this point, but otherwise 1 group can do it easy. When Trunt dies you get his rockfilled head (really, it weighs 20!). 

Step 7: Splish splash, let's take a bath. 

The Fist of Water is a no-fight, so this is very easy. In the underwater caverns of Lake Rathe you will find a DE named Deep. Hand her the head, and she will hand it back and despawn after telling you to take it to her master. 

Step 8: Over there! Over there! 

In OT you will find a monk named Astral Projection. Hand him the head and receive Eye of Kaiaren. Follow the dialogue and he despawns, telling you where to meet him next. 

Step 9: Master Vorash 

In Lake of Ill Omen, out on the platform in the middle of the lake you will find Astral Projection again. This fight is a tough one, so I'd suggest at least 3 groups. Once you hand Astral Projection the Eye it will spawn Vorash and Deep, who immediately start kicking butt and taking names. Have one group take Deep out. She hits for 160ish, and procs Fist of Water, so that group will want lots of CR. Master Vorash procs Fist of Mastery, which is a mean stun and DD, so those two groups will want MR. I don't know how hard he hits yet, I'll edit that in later. Once both mobs are dead Xenovorash will spawn. He's mean. Very mean. I believe he will be proccing Fist of Sentience which is a megastun and 500DD. So everyone will want MR at this point. Again, don't know what he hits for, but 3 groups shouldn't have too much trouble. Xenovorash drops a Demon's Fang. 

Step 10: Home again. 

Kaiaren's true form wanted proof of Vorash's defeat, and now you have it, so off to TT for you again. Hand in your fang and book of Celestial Fists to get your FA. This quest is level locked, so no need to worry about twinkies running around with monk FAs who haven't earned them. 

Step 11: Game Over 

Hooray for you and your friends. You have completed an Epic Quest (tm). Enjoy your booty. 

The Item: Celestial Fists 15AC, 20STR, 10DEX, 10STA, 10AGI, 100hp, 10 vs all, 0.1 weight, magic nodrop lore, effect: Celestial Tranquility - 12AC 54atk and 40% haste. The effect is a bard song effect, and doesn't as yet stack with the pure haste spells from enchanters. The only song or spell it stacks with is Verses of Victory. Also, by just equipping the gloves your fists become 9/16 weapons before any haste items or spells, meaning your fist is now the best primary hand weapon in the game for a monk. For your off hand just get a adamantite club or stave of shielding (both if you can) for extra damage and awesome procs. Nobody is going to be outdamaging a monk with his fists anymore, so kudos to Verant on an awesome reward. 


if you have read all that and need to know where to find ROWF to to my link above then find   epic

i hope this helps some of you
