My, it's gotten quiet around these parts during my extended absence - any of the old crowd still hanging about?

Hey Neptu

I'm still checking this board occasionally but I must say there really hasn't been much here worth responding to in a while.  I really don't want to write one more time about what Race is best for an SK, or tell someone what class they should chose.  It also seems like must of the boards I was reading have gone the same way, so now I just play and only check the boards during patch day.

But that has given me a chance to show some improvements.  I'm finally moving up again with some real advances in power.  I find Soul Abrasion 3 is absolutely awesome, but am somewhat disappointed in Shroud of Chaos (I perfer the mana from Mental Corruption to keep me casting).  Combat Agility 3 has given me the biggest improvement in tanking I have seen in a long time, anyone questioning the value of this one can stop, it's HUGELY more benefitial than a few more HP's.  Now moving on to get the rest of those available HP's with Natural Durability 3 next.

It is good to see you post again, is this going to be a regular occurance again?

Yeah I'm still browsing the boards myself. No new aspects to comment on, just the same old threads. Whats the best ____,_____,____, etc...., that I should play. Nice to see that some of the oldtimers still visit though. 


Only in Darkness may the truth be known.

Woot, nice to see you're still here, Neptunis.  

Yeah, I intend to troll the board semi-regularly ;)  The dimwitted what race/twink gear stuff is hardly anything new here, but Damn, Shadowknight.org has gone to hell in a handbasket - is there ANYWHERE to find meaningful class debate?  Having been largely out of SK play for about a year, I'm a bit behind the times :eek

The AA info is very interesting, I just got done the generals (RS3, Innate Stamina 3, since I never solo & almost always have KEI+ thanks to being married to an Enchanter) and I'm looking to decide where to put my archetype points - I'm waffling on the combination of Natural Durability, Combat Agility, Combat Stability (Defensive skills) versus Spell Casting Fury / Combat Fury / Soul Abrasion (the prime offensive ones) - how do you see the logical order?

On the whole, except for Spear of Decay and Scythe of Innoruuk, I'm not seeing much that's really compelling in our 63-65 lineup for combat spells.  Conjure corpse is a great utility, but that's about it, really - am I missing something?

Damn, I love LDoN - that expansion has been really good to us.

Well there realy isn't anywhere I found that has a good intelligent board for SK's going with good discussions.  Maybe after almost 3 years everything has been said.

I personally like the Blod of Pain lvl 63 DoT, and I just got the Aura of Hate so I still have to play with that 1 a bit.  Shroud of Chaos is a nice damage dealer and HP restorer, it's just that my play style makes me need the mana more.  Shroud proc's about twice as often as the previous taps for 195 damage/HP restored with Soul Abrasion 3 as opposed to 150 damage/mana stolen with Mental Corruption.

I think Combat Agility is FAR superior to Natural Durability.  For me avoiding getting hit once or twice when the MOB is hitting for 200+ outweighs the 300 extra HP's total you get with Natural Duability.  I have done less with Combat Stability but it seems to be the most problematic of the 3 for real tangible improvements (it supposedly reduces only a percentage of the time so not a flat 2% reduction of damage off every hit).  I have also put the least effort into this 1 so I can't speak for alot of personal experience.

Good to see you back, and I hope we can get some intelligent posting back here.

Blood of Pain - I just revisited it (I was thinking it was a sequel to Ignite Blood, doh!) - nice, a fast poison DoT, pretty handy, sort of a souped up Venom of Snake.

Still mucking about with my Archetype AAs - since I mostly do LDoN, I'm thinking about going more offensive AA heavy.  We'll see - I'm not in any rush to start spending those AAs anyway.

Well I did some Offensive AA's as well, but they seem to not add as much as I'd want.  Combat Fury is ok, and I see it helping often when I use the Leech discipline, extra damage is extra healing.  I also am working Speed of the Knight, Knights Advantage and Double Rippost, all of which seem to help but just not a big improvement in DPS.  Spell Casting Fury I passed on for now since I use so few DD spells, but the ability to get exceptional heals off lifetaps I did get and it's a good way to upset the Druids with how often you exceptional compared to them.  My record was 3 exceptional heals in one cast of Zepher's Bite, that got peoples attention, not that it helped alot but it sure looked cool.

As you can see I've spread out my AA's a bunch and tried to see what was worth while.  Combat Fury I think is good, Finishing Blow I think was a waste of my AA.  Otherwise I think almost everything except spell casting subtlety (why would they give that to a class that uses spells for agro???) have use.  However I find that in LDoN I spend more time as primary tank than ever before.  As such I have had to go back and start working more defensive AA's than I initially planned.  As always I think what AA's will do you the most good is going to be very dependant on play style and your typical group composition.

I'm definitely LDoN heavy..raiding a moderate amount, but probably 70% of my play time is in LDoN.  Mostly I'm debating an "eliminate the negative" strategy to improve damage, versus an "Accentuate the positive" to improve tanking - I'm leaning to the latter, as shadowknight IS a defensive class.

Because of the 2,4,6 costs on archetype AAs, I'm quite strongly inclined to get multiple AAs at level one rather than one at level 3 - it's worth noting that for 12 points you can get:
1 Ability at level 3
2 Abilities at level 2
1 Ability at level 2 and 3 at level 1
6 Abilities at level 1

One factor I'm considering is that CA, CS and ND all can be enhanced by the Class Physical Enhancement ability.  At present, I'm leaning to:
(Archetype) CF1, CA1, SCF1, ND1, CS1, CA2 (14 points total)
(Class) Physical Enhancement

As you can see, that's pretty heavily defensive - I don't see much reason to plan beyond that at this point - I may go PoP abilities (Knight's advantage / Speed of the Knight), fill up on Archetype AAs or even get my horsie first (pure vanity, I know).

I'm thinking SCF because I use Spears constantly - since I almost invariably have KEI or better for regen, I'm usually pretty free in my casting

I choce PE first because it enhances all three defenive archetype abilities.

Oh, there's a simple answer on why we get spell casting subtlety - ALL spell users get it.  I just pity the poor fool SK who picks it ;)

Cheers!

LOL I just came back to this forum for the first time in at least a year to see what you guys were up to.  Good to see Nephtu and Neptunis again.

My character isn't active ATM  and probably won't ever be.  I'm holding out for Lineage 2 and Worlds Of Warcraft ATM.

All that stuff you guys just talked about went over my head.  My sk only got to 42 before I quit.  Its been 2-3 expansions since then so I have no idea WTH is going on in this game anymore.  

It is good to see you guys are well and still here.  Shadowknight.org was just too much information to take it. Some bum peeps as well.

Have a great time on the game guys, maybe we'll hook up on some other title in the future ???

But if evil is so lame and stupid as you say it is, why is good so preoccupied with us?  Could it be perhaps that good has a crush on evil? :P

Hi, Seph!

Hope you enjoy Lineage - FFXI also might be worthwhile - if that androgynous anime look is your bag, the game is getting a pretty good rap.  I'm kind of skeptical about WoW, but time will tell.

EQ is much the same, still knocking monsters over the head for cash & prizes.  The level grind just goes to about 65+150 AA, so it's that much longer.  

Lost Dungeons of Norrath has somewhat changed the EXP scene however - it's all isntanced semi-randomized dungeons  you have to crawl (no respawns) on a 90 minute timer to kill x monsters, collect x items or assasinate/rescue an NPC with only the initial group (of 3-6 players) for whom the dungeon was spawned being able to enter it.  It's been very good to knights, IMAO - it's even gotten me EXPing again - I loathed EXP camping, especially 50+ because the pace was so slow.

Well I can't enjoy Lineage ATm because they haven't released the beta in the U.S yet.  I hope they don't push it back too long.

That's cool lost dungeons of Norrath put all that in.

Although I have to say, Everquest is basically ripping off everything from Anarchy online.  Ao had the random dungeon thing, and the new interface designs (i.e linking  items in chat, chat servers, etc)

The boys @ verant are just ripping them off, but hey do what you gotta do to get money right?

Currentely if I had a choice I'd play Final Fantasy XI, Anarchy online, or Eve Online, Horizons also has an interesting storyline and characters.  I think the combat system is very suspect.

Lineage 2 is turning me off abit since so far its pretty much full pvp.  Hopefully WOW will be something to behold.

I hear they killed the sleeper on Rallos.  Given enough time I'm sure there is a guild out there who could kill an npc will a billion hps.
