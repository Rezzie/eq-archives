<b><u><a href="http://www.eqastronomy.cjb.net">Hall of the Astronomers of Norrath</a></b></u>

<b>Updated:</b> 18 December, 2002

We have developed research in an astronomical construct of the Norrath System. A greater indepth research into the past findings have been conducted, and we are therefore releasing the 3rd Edition of the Astronomical Findings of Norrath.

<b>New Additions to Version:</b>

Updated information of Drinal and Morrell, the other two moons of Norrath 

Change in the view of Luclin's relationship to Norrath.

A more thorough revised concept of Tidal Lock and the proof of Norrath Tides.

Explanation for perpetual Cloud motion and not being able to see Luclin, Morrell and Starfields from Norrath.

Addition of the Gravitational Theory of Luclin's relationship to Norrath

The following will state our findings and analyzation of the over all astronomical system of Norrath:

<b><u>Luclin:</u></b>

Luclin has a 35 - 40 degree tilt perpendicualr to its axis of rotation where its axis of rotation is pointed almost directly at Norrath.. This is evident with the location of NOrrath near the zenith. All the currenly known inhabited areas of Luclin are in its North Western and Eastern Hemisphere while the Light side is found on Luclin's South Western and Eastern Hemisphere.

It is Tidal Locked to Norrath where due to slowing down of the rotational period of Norrath, the rotational period of Drinal is proportional to Norrath's where as Drinal orbits Norrath the same side of Drinal faces Norrath as the gravitational pull of Norrath maintains the perpectual facing.

When viewing Norrath from Luclin, one can see that in addition to Luclin perpetually facing Norrath with the same side, Norrath too faces Luclin with the same side which is called a Geosynchronous Orbit. This is caused when back in Luclins past Norraths gravitational pull has slowed down Luclin where it no longer Orbits, but is not locked in a perminant gravitational hold where its rotation is proportional to Norraths. Ans Norrath Rotates Luclin maintains a perpetual lock above the same part of the sky with the same face facing Norrath. This evidence being when you observe Norrath from the surface of Luclin one can see that the Eastern Hemisphere where both Faydwer and Kunark are located are perpetually facing Luclin. Using this logic one could state that Luclin is perpetually at the zenith over both Faydwer and Kunark. Due to the Veil and other conditions, one can not see Luclin from Norrath.

Luclin has no phases. Currently this is proven by the fact that as Luclin continues to orbit Norrath in its geosynchonized orbit, the dark side, which the populous of Luclin resides, is never lit. 

When viewing current charts of Luclin, its axis appears to be oriented 90 degrees perpendicular to Norrath, meaning, it rotates about its access perpendicular on its end, which would result in no precession, meaning it does not wobble about its axis over a given period of time where its northern axis point towards a different part of the sky. But, being there are no past records found, this may need more looking into over thousands of years to see if indeed it is wobbling. Even though one can not see Luclin from Norrath and it is locked in a geosynchronized orbit over the Eastern Hemisphere of Norrath, the sun does appear to move across the sky daily, there is no occurance of phases, which it should occur.

<b><u>Norrath:</u></b>

Norrath rotates about its axis on its side. This evidence being shown by the observation of the suns movement about the sky. The sun rises due north and sets due south. No matter the orbital plane and path that Norrath takes orbiting the Sun, the path determines the rotational direction and position of Norrath that the Sun moves across the sky of Norrath.

Norrath rotates every 24hours, which equals the time for one Norrath Day. Norrath rotates about its axis on it side. Its pose are located Due East and Due West where it spins about its axis from Due North to Due South.

Norrath DOES have Tides. This is explained by the observation of Drinal and Luclin representing a basic property called Tidal Lock. This is displayed by the fact that the Rotational period of the moons are directly proportional to the rotational period of Norrath and their orbital period around Norrath due to the gravitational forces of the Tides to the rotational spin of the Moons and Norrath itself.

Norraths Orbital plane about the Sun is equal to its Tilt Plane.

The sun when seen from Luclin is perpetually behind Luclin, so as Luclin orbits about Norrath the Sun continues to stay behind Luclin all year round. So with this you can come up with the conjecture that as Norrath and Luclin perpetually face each other as they are locked in a geosynchonized orbit where as the rotational period of both Luclin and Norrath are inversely proportion to Luclin’s Orbital period about Norrath, where the same face of both bodies face each other. At the same time, Luclin’s rotational period in reference to Norrath’s is inversely proportional to the sun, where upon Norrath’s yearly orbit about the sun with the same face of Luclin perpetually faces the sun, thus giving evidence to the perpetual day/night sides of Luclin. If we were to see Luclin from Norrath, the sun and Luclin would be in a perpetual Eclipse, either being total or partial. But since this is not seen, Luclin is offset in respect to the sun as to not show this affect.

Right now the leading thought on why the clouds seen from Norrath do not move is that there are really two layers of a cloud type. The lower level seen on Norrath moving across the sky with the wind current, and an outer layer, may haps a result of the Veil, which is perpetually engulfing Norrath and does not move. This view will satisfy both events. But why the outer layer seen from Luclin seems to have open areas light you would think of a cloud system, I don't know why.


<b>Luclin Gravitational Field</b>

The basic principle which would establish a gravitational field for a celestial body is the rotational spin about its axis. If any object is spinning at an approprate speed the outcome would be an increase in centripical force which would result in a gravitational field. Now because Luclin is both Tidal Locked and in a Geosynchronized orbit with Norrath, where it is spinning at the same interval as Norrath, then IF Luclin is smaller, which has not yet been determined, then Luclin would need to spin faster to have an equal gravity with Norrath. Since they are spinning at the same interval, then Luclin would have less gravity.

Two Things to Consider:

1. Luclin and Norrath are the same diameter, therefore along with their geosynchronized orbit and tidal lock, they have the same gravity.

2. Luclin could be slightly smaller then Norrath, which would result in a slighly less gravity, too small for us to notice. This would still maintain the principle of why Luclin Orbits Norrath and not the other way around. A smaller body, having a lower gravitational field will orbit another with a larger mass and gravity. Luclin and Norrath could indeed share a near same size, again sharing a binary system where both over a given period of time will orbit about each other. This has never been observed. Only time and observation can yield a truth to this idea.

Remember, that there is still a whole other half, most of the light side and 1/3 of the dark side of Luclin still unexplored, so indeed Luclin is quite larger then one may think. The area which we currently have access to on Luclin seems to be about the same size area as Faydwer and Antonica Occupies.

Until we are able to observe Luclin from Norrath, we will not be able to give a more precise distance and size of Luclin.

As for the chunk of land jedisoned from Odus, indeed the debris has a high chance of being one of the reasons why we can not see a star field. But, it is unlikely that this chunk contacted with Luclin because we do not know how far Luclin is from Norrath and because Norrath's gavity maybe too great to allow the piece of land to excape completly, that the idea that this piece of land is infact either Drinal or the 3rd un-named moon. If evidense is found other wise, then of course it is quite welcome. But who knows. If indeed the chunck did impact Luclin, it could have resulted in the beginning of life there. But of course, it is only speculation. 

<b><u>Drinal:</u></b>

Drinal is one of the total three confirmed moons of Norrath. This moon we see nightly as it rises from the north and sets in the south. I have let to gain the use of a telescope any information to verify this, but with the naked eye, Drinal looks to be a dead world with no presence of an Atmosphere, vegitation, or water. It is seen to be littered with craters and valleys. The surface of it may contain very finely groud soil simular to a powder.

It rises at about 8 pm and sets at about 8 am where due to Norraths rotation about its axis it takes about 24 hours for 1 complete revolution. Drinal is seen to orbit about Norrath along its equator. So, as it moves about the sky ans NOrrath spins on its axis it is also orbiting around the same path. The reason this is found is because if Drinal did orbit about a path different then along Norrath's Equator we would see a deviation in the rise and set locations of Drinal. But, it consistanly rises due North and sets Due South.

Distance: Unknown

It is Tidal Locked to Norrath where due to slowing down of the rotational period of Norrath, the rotational period of Drinal is proportional to Norrath's where as Drinal orbits Norrath the same side of Drinal faces Norrath as the gravitational pull of Norrath maintains the perpectual facing.
IF when observed from Norrath the sun moves about the sky as Norrath rotates about its axis, then because Luclin is locked in a geosynchonized orbit, why at no point is the sun ever found at opposition to Luclin, thus during a period of time Luclin observing phases. Where even though not see from Norrath, Luclin should observed phases which can be seen from Luclin itself. 

Being that Norrath does rotate on its side, and the Sun moves about the sky from North to South, at which point we do not observe any changes in Seasons, and the temperature staying constant through out the year, then why is it that Velious, lying in the South, where the sun would move across the Ecliptic and across the zenith of a Norrath day for 12 hours, or half a Norrath day, and that being it does not contain a off set tilt to its axis, then why is it that Velious itself continues to stay the same temperature and continue to hold the same mass of ice. And if the sun is moving about the sky along Norrath’s Equator, why are there no Polar Ice caps on the Western and Eastern Poles of Norrath due to the fact that there is less of a direct contact with the radiation from the sun.

<b>Morrell</b> - Third Moon of Norrath

No direct info has been specifically released or found that is ready to be released to the public about Norrath's Third moon that is said to be named after Morrell-Thule, the SubDiety Lord of Dreams. Screen shots are still in the process of being taken from the Plane of Sky


<b>Fennin Ro</b> 

Norrath's Sun aka Fennin Ro, named after the Tyrrant Diety of Fire, when seen from Luclin is perpetually behind Luclin, so as Luclin orbits about Norrath the Sun continues to stay behind Luclin all year round. If we were to see Luclin from Norrath, the sun and Luclin would be in a perpetual Eclipse, either being total or partial. But since this is not seen, Luclin is offset in respect to the sun as to not show this affect.

Distance: Unknown

<b><u>Stars, Luclin, and Morrell not visible from Norrath</u></b>

A new theory for why Norrath is seen from Luclin, and not Luclin from Norrath. As short wavelength light from Luclin attempts to pass through the VEIL it is repelled or reflected away, if not absorved. But, the sun having higher frequency wavelengths, the VEIL repels partial waves while the rest reaches the surface as the sunlight we see. This will explain why we can see the Sun and Not Luclin or Morrell. Drinal is placed in between Norrath and the Veil, thus will not be influenced by the Veils properties.

Because of the Veil's presence this would explain why we can not see any star field. I visited Erudin a time ago and was present when the Casters of the Great City tested their great teleportation abilities to the great Plane of Power. During that time Drinal seemed to be in a Waxing Crescent Phase. To be in this phase, Drinal would have to have gone from a Full Moon, which is what we see, to a 3rd Quarter, New Moon, then at the time, a waxing crescent which is halfway between the New Moon and 1st Quarter Moon Phase. Some how when this casting of arcane occurred the Veil may have be been temporally lifted or pushed back, because I too observed star fields. That has been the first and last time I have seen Drinal in a Phase and visible Star Fields.

<b><u>The "Nameless" and the Physical Laws of the Universe</U></b>

I have heard tales that in the beginning the "Nameless" came upon the laws of the universe and set them in motion. If this is true, then there must have been something before him.
