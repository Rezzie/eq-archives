take a minute and look at all the classes on Everquest... now take a second look at the warrior class... anyone else have a feeling that warriors got shafted?? with most new expansions that came out, most classes got at least a couple spells or even abilities... now of course warriors got something right? well wasnt it the same as paladins / shadow knights? so in fact, those hybrid classes got more from any expansion. so why not do something for just the warrior class. they should be the strongest class in the game but i have seen paladins and shadowknights out-do them on several occasions. this is what i propose... give the warrior class a familiar called a squire, and make it similar to the wizard class's imp familiar in the sense that the warrior would gain perhaps hp / ac increases as long as the squire is within the warrior's side.
what do you think about that? theguywhoisalwaysbored@yahoo.com

I can picture it now..... the warrior is all set to MT the mob with the squire dancing around next to him just as the mob casts an AE nuke and obliderates the squire instantly.

Familiars are silly. I make mine "get lost" every time I conjur/zone. I keep the buff, but not the flappy following me causing everyone extra lag.

So, basically it is a self-only buff (Big surprise there....the only buffs wizards have that are useful.)

Warriors don't cast buffs on themselves. Except from equipment that has spells.

Warriors due exactly what they are supposed to do (absorb massive amounts of damage) and they do it better than any other class in the game, hands down.

If you want to play the highest damage melee character in the game, start up a Rogue.

If you want to solo, a Necro would be a good choice.

Do you want to have awesome hitpoints and be able to trade blows with a mob better than any other class?  Be a Warrior.

See what I'm getting at?  Everyone has thier place. Everyone has thier role.  There is nothing wrong with the warrior class.  They do thier job and do it well.

He has a problem that no one here can help him with.  It's called being delusional.

<I>they should be the strongest class in the game but i have seen paladins and shadowknights out-do them on several occasions</i>

See?  If you saw a PAL/SHD "out-doing" a warrior in HP/DMG, then you saw a very well equipped PAL/SHD versus a very badly equipped WAR.

The ONLY thing, and I mean only thing, that's even remotely needed for warriors is some kind of Taunt tweak.  However, only a very slight Taunt tweak is needed...nothing grandiose.

I can think of two things that would help the warrior class without unbalancing them.  Improve their taunt so that it generates a certain percent more hate than other classes' taunts (let's say 25-35%), and give them all a stunning attack that doesn't need a sheild.  Nothing big...something like the large race's "slam" ability, but exclusive to warriors and not limited to large races.  Stunning abilities are increasingly important as levels go up...which is why most LDON groups want paladins and shadowknights.  Most warriors drop sheild use once they get dual wield, in favor of the higher damage output they can do with two weapons.

I think those two things would improve their ability to keep aggro as the MT without making them too powerful.  After all, they get all those hit points so they can take more damage than anyone else.  What's the point if they can't hold the mob's attention?

People make warriors so that they can be in the front line, not to solo or chase the mobs around trying to regain aggro.  All those nice hit points go to waste, and I'm beginning to understand why I see so many warriors between level 50-65 using two handed blunt (that staff of thunder or whatever from LDON is very popular now).  If using fast weapons for aggro isn't doing you any good, you might as well go for the higher damaging weapons, right?

Agreed!  I play a 50+ lvl warr, and I made a rant post on Bogmaster's guid (wink check it out lol)about the various situations in which a Warrior is unequipped for the jobs other chars ask of her. 
    Yes, an intelligent player can get the gear to vastly improve her warrior, but at the cost of massive PP. Ask any warrior how easy it is for them to make PP and they will probably cry. We can't sell buffs or services (at least a rogue can sell his lockpick for **** sake!) or easily solo mobs to "farm" cash.  The most we can hope for is to win the roll on a decent drop and sell it. So, making PP is an issue.  So, we can't buy the gear we need (or u can spend hard earned RL cash and BUY your pp...but that's not an option all of us have). 
    Allright, so now you're just a warrior with the items you've managed to glean,beg,borrow in your travels. YES an SK or a PALLY can MT over you! Many raids/groups PREFER this! You are a liability! they will spend precious mana/time healing you, dragging your corpse, porting you from zone to zone! I had a druid get crabby with me once because she had to port back to save me from a dragon - since everyone else had gated. Srry Ms. Druid I dont have gate. 
   Ok, so you lvl some more and all your friends start getting their epics. Where's your epic?? Haha my little warrior friends..your epic is LONG, HARD, requires much usage of other player's kindness and in the end isn't that great (you can BUY better weps for less effort!) PLEASE PLEASE get us a better epic! Make it worth our while! Give us something that will actually make us proud to carry and say "ha! look at my epic! whats up now??" 
    Please help warriors. I know everyoen says "well if you want to do this blah blah blah play another class" the point is we dont want another class! We want warriors who are truely the masters of fighting! Who can taunt better! Who can take more damage! Deal more damage! Ok I can live with begging for ports, rezzes and heals (im used to it by now) but give us something that will truly make us stand out above other melees. Someone in another post (sorry if i didnt catch your name) mentioned that in the world of healer hybrids, of course, clerics are the ones groups want most.  So how come in the world of melee hybrids warriors arent most wanted? We should BE THE BEST melee! 
   GRRR lol I'm done..sorry this was so long but I needed to vent. Catch y'all in game..

I agree wholeheartedly with the two above posters.  Platinum has been the hardest thing for me to aquire, especially with my warrior as my main.  

After hitting 51, I've noticed I can hold aggro much better, but it still isn't good enough at times.  I like the ideas of giving us a higher taunt or maybe the possibility of stun...no familiars, please. :lol
