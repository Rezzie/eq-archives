Hey, this is Nizamnoly... Maybe you've met me... but here's my problem:

Ok, so I brought all my alt's to EC to get rid of their valuables and give em to my main to sell, cuz my main had like 18 pp to her name. I got my bank items and all my stuff I could sell, and put it in my most precious bag (only a 400pp 70% one) and so I put the bag in trade slot, and a bug hit, and the bag disapeared. I tried petitioning but nothing happened, and I waited it out, but nothing happened.
I don't really want to risk doing stein quest cuz of screwing something up, and dyingm or having to bind myself for some reason, because im bound in OT. I dont want to go hunt because I always hunt in OT and im looking for fast money not fast levels. I know lots of you may say you can solo in certain places, but I suck at soloing 8(. 
Should I start selling my clothes for money or what? I need help!
Thanks,
-NizzyDLizzy

Hey, it's Niz again. So far, no help, BUT I have some good news.

I decided (with a little convincing from a friend) to gate to OT and hunt for a bit, since it would help my money problems a bit, and also get my stubborn self to level up a bit. Well, now I get about 20 plat every 3 hours, which is ok, and I got to level 35 in 12 hours of playing. I'll be satisfied for awhile (until I find I'm screwing myself for some reason).

I swear this exp looks like it's sucking, but maybe it's just my impatience. I get 1 blue pixel every kill (reds, yellows), and that's why it takes me so long to level. I estimate in about 4 months I'll get sick of this levelinging in OT, and go to EC with a couple hundred plat, and my newly achieved level 40. I hope I have Velious by level 40, hehehe. 

Tomarrow I'll be smacking myself for saying a few stupid things here, but ahh well; time for RL to kick in. Cya laterz)

UPDATE:
I got out of boring OT and went to Upper Guk. Got me-self a map of Up. Guk, and when I got in zone, someone offered AC camp to anyone who wanted it, because he had been there for 8 hours with nothing, and decided to leave. I decided to camp it because I could handle it, so he helped me find it, buffed me up, and I started killing the crocs for exp. (1-5 crocs spawn every 20 min as place holders, AC is random) So, when mez broke and all four spawns attacked me at once in one of the spawns, I died. I got myself to L. Guk ent, dead side, without the map (from memory) and someone who was interested in the camp sent me a tell asking if it was still camped. I said yeah but I just died, so she offered some help, and by the time we got to the camp and we were both settled, we agreed to help each other kill the spawns. I got them to more then half with my pet and some nukes, and then she killed them off with her pet. It worked out really well, and sure enough, about 2 hours later, the AC popped. It dropped pants the first time (which was what she wanted, so she got them), but I got the exp. The second time it spawned was about 2 hours later, while I was AFK. She killed it, and when I came back she presented me with my arms that I wanted. We amused ourselves in between the spawns very well, and what once was a boring camp, turned into a fun time. After I got my arms, we both parted. I would have stayed if it wasn't for boredom and fear of dying from 4 spawns. I got a new friend, some pride, exp, and arms out of this situation. 
After this, I found my way back to Feerrott, and quickly got myself a port to WC seeing as I had never gotten from Feerrott to WC on my own. When I got to WC I was having fun killing the bears and willowisps. I got a GLS and 3 Lightstones, and some gold and silver from it. I twice accidentally killed another PC's bear, so to reimburse them, I apologized, buffed them, and gave them a lightstone and some other newbie gifts that someone my level (even as badly equipped as me) wouldn't appreciate. Then, I finally found some MQ and HQ bear skins, and sold them. The MQ brought me 5pp, while the HQ got me a crushed jaundice gem, and an opal. Soon, I got bored and since I only had about 15pp to my name, I shouted my offering of buffs, with donations not required but appreciated. I got about 40pp from this in 20 min, and then it was getting late so I decided to log off.
While I was camping the AC, I logged off for about 5 min, and emailed my guild's raid coordinator, to talk to her about a raid to kill the AC in Sro. I've already gotten the Shadow Dagger (or whatever it's called) before, so I know how/where to kill it. And soon when I finish doing a few Stein of Moggok quests, I'll have more than enough money for Hasten Bootstrutter. 
It seems that since I have the weight of being bound in OT off my shoulders, I can do whatever I want! I was always worried that if I bound myself somewhere else, then I would have a tough time getting back to OT, but when I think about it, it's not that hard running from giants in FM to get to OT. 
So, I guess now that I'm care-free about running around Norrath, and I've made my own little EQ-path for the future, I can play EQ for fun, and not just leveling and equip (even though both are fun!).
