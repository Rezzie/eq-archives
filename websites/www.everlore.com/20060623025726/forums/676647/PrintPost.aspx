this is my post to all newbs with no maney or exp. I am writing this b/c i have searched through so many sites and posts, but have found nothing that is really meant for people who don't know what is going on. most of it will help, but you have to put bits and peice s together. So i am puttig all that i know together and hoping other wth more knowledge than me will add on to the post.

first the levels. 1-5 kill decaying skeletons and spiderlings. Sell everything you get except for bone chips and spiderling silks. For the equipment just use whatever you find or can afford to buy from the vendors withiout spending to much money. Buy all of the bone chips you find. If you can afford to buy spider or spiderling silks then do so. you can turn in bone chi8ps in kaladim for exp and if you want in kaladim. Also, if you find any low quality pelts and can affor them buy them as well.

5-7 kill orc centurions for the belts and spiders for the silks. For the orcs you can turn in the belts. Otherwise just kill anyting that you can.

8-10 go to butcherblock mountains and kill goblins. YOu may level kinda slow, but the plat for goblin heads and vials of blood is to good to pass up. You will need this money.

10-14/15 go to kurns tower. try to get a bind, but it is not neccisary. Go inside and kill whatever you can. at first if you ccan find a group then join them. towards the end you want to try to solo and melle as much as you can without putting yourself in danger to get your defence and offence up. Once again get as many bone chips as you can.

15-24 Go to the paladial caverns. Find a group. at first pretty much all you will do is heal and snare, but both of those are much requestied here, so you should have little problemms finding a group. when you first get ther you will want to have someone show you how to skirt the edges to get around the first village. If you do not go behind the village you will die. 

I don't know where to go from here yet, but when i do find smeplace i will add on.

Now for the money. Whenever you decide you are done for the day go to the Bazaar. If you do not kow where it is you can find it through the nexus. YOu can enter the nexus from nexus portals or through the nexus stone in the POK. You will need a liilt over 1p to buy a traders sachel.Once you have the sachel go to any open area one one of the steps and type in /trader to set up your stand.

Type in /bazaar to search the other vendors and find out how much to sell your wares for. 

My serrver is crowded, so prices are pretty low i think. 
Bone chips sell for about 5g. That is a huge profit margin considering if you can find them they sell for about 5s. 
spider and spiderling silks sell for about 3p apiece. not bad money.
If you have low quality pelts you can combine them with a silk thread to make leather padding that sells for about 15p. very nice progfit margin, but you need to work on tailoring for that.
now for the big money maker....celestial essence.
You can buy celestial solvent from ne of the one of the NPC's for about five s in th bazaar. If you go to the POK you can buy essence of marr for abnout 1.5p. you combine those with a mortar and pestal, which is a no fail combine, and you ahve celestail essence. i sell this for about 5p apiece. that is a profit of 60p per stack. I made 3k off of these in one weeekend.

Also, if you find any medium or high quality pelts they also sell well. 

To find out what price to sell for just do a search for that item and sell for a mid price. 

I have ywt to find other items that sell well, but anyone else who knows, please add on. I know i am more than happy to do the grunt work and sell things if i can make some money to get better equipment.

As for equipment...before 14 you want to get a decent damage weapon and sme items with increased AC. Don't spend to much money on this, even if you can afford to. These levels will pass by quick and you will not need that type of equipment for very long. 
When you get to 14 you want to start looking for focus effect items. The first itme you want is mana conservation, as it decreases mana cost by 10%. i  found earings with this on them for only 35p. Next, as you are a healer in PC most of the time try to find improved healing. Ou can find it for about 100p and it will serve you until level 29. Also, if you can find improve damage 1 then get it, as your 19 level dd will be your best until 29. For the rest of the items, if you want you can find extra wisdom, but don't spend to much on it.

As you start making money you will want to look for focus II items. They will work with all spells till 40
which will take a druid all the way to level 44 spells. You really want mana preservation and all of the afflictions(which work on your DoT spells). If you search carefully you can find some of these for pretty low prices, but some of them are always going to be pretty expensive. Pay the price. focus items are just to good. and they will take you till level 44 before you need to start thinking of upgrading equipment, and by then you should be able to find better ways of making money. For better information about focus items go to castersrealm.com.

If you follow this you will level pretty quick, you will  make good money, and you will have very good equipment for your level.
THis is all of the really good info i have. I know i am a newb, but i know this will help other newbs, and i am hoping others with more knowledge than me can add on so i can learn more as well(that was a thinly disguised plea for help). Soo, add on ore use and happy hunting.

I'm guessing that you are a wood elf druid...

My path? As a halfling...

Kill the rats that are infesting the city for exp.  Easy kills and can get you to level 3 in no time.  Don't forget to turn in the wiskers (in fours) for more exp and some change.  Talk to Rebo Leafsway about Deputy Tagil, he will give you a note to give to Tagil (who is right outside the city in Misty Thicket). Tagil will give you a coin to return to Rebo. Give the coin to Rebo and get some exp and some cash.

  Fist thing to do when you hit level 5? Kill a fire beatle.  You need one of their eyes on you at all times for your 'fire' line of spells to work, EVEN at the high end of the game!!!  Hunt within the wall ( find maps on <A HREF="HTTP://www.eqatlas.com" TARGET="_BLANK">www.eqatlas.com</A> ) killing rats, bats, beatles, snakes and bixies.  You 'can' kill the wolves as well.. but if you want to roleplay a druid you won't.

  Once you have snare and a harmony spell look towards the deseased rats and skellies that are in clusters within some ruined walls.  Harmony as many as possible and snare one. DoT (yes flamelick is a Dot) blast it and melee, rince repeat.  The rats and plauge rats can sometimes drop plague rat tails that sell for over 1pp each.  These rats are also the ones that drop the pelts you need for your moss toe newbie gear.

On the other side of that wall are creatures that can be taken at level 12(ish).  Stick close to the guards but be carefull when using them.  Halfling guards are known to get a little jumpy and end up clearing the zone of MOBs if they get pulled out too far.  The Giant Wood spiders and Giant rats and Wasps are targets if you wish to finish off your moss toe gear.

I skipped PDC myself and went solo in North Karana picking off the giant beatles and borer beatles until I could take on the Griffawns.. Remember /consider is your friend.  If Grimfeather or The Silver Griffon are near by run for your life.... really.... they can take the guards at the towers down and use you as a light desert.

After the griffawns and griffens became light blue or green to me, I moved into South Karana and soloed the Tismak Gnolls (spelling)  at the spires.  To find the spires hug the left side of the bridge after zoneing in and head south (now that your compas will work no matter what, these directions should not be a problem).  Gnolls will get you well into your 30's.

After hitting your 30's you can now make the trek to Rathe Mountains.  Check maps on eq atlas to find the way to the Hill Giants.  You CAN solo these at 30 if you are careful and if you only have ONE. DoT damage and snare are the way to go here, and get used to the "Root Rot" method... These mobs are great exp and "can" drop up to 45pp a kill, not including fine steel weapons that can sell for 4-5 platinum to vendors.  **Warning** this zone is normaly swamped with people farming for plat... if there are more than 8 people in the zone, pass on it and go somewhere else like Dawnshroud Peaks or Mar Saru.


Personally, I would not waste my hard earned plat to buy spiderling or spider silks or bone chips to sell in the bazaar.. Too much time and plat wasted when you can kill for the plat.. The only time I found myself wanting for more platinum was when I needed 10k to buy a jade reaver for my epic ( good luck getting one in CoM start saving now :) )

That's all for now.

I only set up and sell at the bazaar when i cannot play. It doesn't take to much time, especially once you get prts, and with the money i have better equipment so i can solo much batter and faster. I think the extra speed from the good equipment is worth the effort, but that is just my thought. I tried the gnolls, and they are pretty good for soloing, but I am 26 and trying Highhold keep, and it is faster, if less loot.
