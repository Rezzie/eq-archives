I play EQ on Vie for one week now and somehow i wonder why i ever stopped playing baldurs gate because most conversations i habd with npcs there lasted longer then those with the players.

under 10th level everone is too busy leveling up to talk and over 10th talking in the wilderness seems most players too risky because something could hit em from behind. sometimes the athmosphere felt more like playing some kind of economy real-time sim than a roleplaying game....

i grouped 7 times with 5-13 level chars while I advanced over 10th but left every time because instead of planning tactically how to take on a dervish camp (p.e.) - bashing single creatures (to "lvl up") was the rule.

I based in freeport and some people even got pissed off because i obviously created a lot of conversation hot-buttons with 20-30 word-long texts (which takes some chat-screen room i admit) and because i explained locations as i remembered them looking from the first-person view instead of referring to the "official" map termini. asking first if i may ASK a favour and then even dare to explain what i needed and why seemed also only annoying. 

and someone refered to me as an asshole because i made my based own motivation for beeing around on the search for two people and a wolf and refused to accept that this certain animal has been killed by a low level char outside the freeport gates....

I also had some RPG-worth experiences i have to admit, the most noticingably beeing a conversation with a hooded troll on a rainy night in nektulos forrest who tried to learn elvish from me while we both and his halfling comrade waited for daylight. stumbling over his corpse later that (real-time)day even somehow touched me.

but if generally all i get on Vie is "which lvl?" and beeing bombarded with spells on every occasion because it means practice for the caster i wonder what i will get on other servers :(

I also think that F.V. is not realy "role-playing prefered". It realy ticks me of.The closest thing I've goten to role-playing is my search to up grade the sachal from Lost Dungens(which nearly noone has).
I was got onto by a char that I asked about the purpal
names(OOC isint allowed on F.V.). I was vary dissapointed when I made my char on F.V. but I'm over it now.

I think this is one of the most interesting and smartest post i've read in weeks.  8)

Its true that we should take a little bit more time and be more in character.  Fear the Ogre warrior as his taunts elven wizards.  To be curteous to our female adventurers.  And to boast our exploits and share our stories.

Instead we create mules and try to level up characters so that we can live the fast life in EQ, farm things and make cash.

I feel for you friend, for the lack of essence in our everyday gameplay in this game.  We could make it more, Sony is doing their best, we have to chip in too.

The feeling also is, especially if you're a new, 'shut up, level, and go train elsewhere'..

*sigh*  8P

I would like to say, I just came back to EQ (left when Legends of Ykesha came out) and I have spent just as much time roleplaying on this server as I have doing everything else combined at lvl 13. You have to put a little effort in and make people think you want to hear them roleplay. Take time to do your farming and powerleveling, but then take some time away from that to put into adding to the storyline, sit down in a bar and offer to buy someone a drink. If your over 30, come back to some of the beginner cities and spend time talking with others, even if they are lowbies. Sure there are gonna be times when you find people who don't roleplay at all, maybe even long periods of time where you fall out of character (thats right try to invision your toons unique background and personality.. might be a good idea to write it down before you even make your character), but it will come back. If someone has an idea about their character go with it.
For example I'm serving a Tier`dal Ambassador to Paineel, well I'll tell you the rest of whats going on later, I don't want to ruin the story for anyone who knows me that might come across this, but you have to be creative and even make things up. Why can't you be a gnomish Librarian for Akanon? If someone goes looking for a spell or component, you can tell them just where to look.
Well thats my take on it.

I play on Xegony with a Wood Elf Bard as my main character and have been ridculed and laughed at for trying to add a bit of roleplaying to the game.  My hot key for a congratualtions is "Bristlebane [my deity of choice] sings praises for your new status."
This has been atatcked by other players, even ones I have just acknowledged!!!
As a bard I want to learn all the languagues I can but this too meets with a who cares - oh look at this guy- attitude.  Everyone seems to be interested in gaining levels and gear.

Roleplaying seems to be vaporware nowadays.

And yet, I still log on and play.....
