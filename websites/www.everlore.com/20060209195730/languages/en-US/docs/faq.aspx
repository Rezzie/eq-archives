      Depending upon how Community Server is installed you may be required to create an account before posting. Community Server supports anonymous contributions, but this option must be enabled by an administrator. To take advantage of all the features offered by Community Server, such as setting your own avatar, tracking post counts, emailing users, private messages, access private forums, and many other you will need to have an account. It only takes a few seconds to register, and it is recommended you do so.

      To create an account you will need to visit the Registration page and complete the form for creating a new account. Here you will specify details such as your login name and email address – depending upon how Community Server is configured you may also be asked to specify a password. If you are not asked to specify a password, one will be emailed to you after successfully registering.

      If you forgot your username and/or password you can visit the Forget Your Password page and have both your username and a new password emailed to you by entering the email account you're registered with. You will be sent a new password since we store your password encrypted and have no way of retrieving the original value. Once you receive your username and new password you can login and change your password.

      You can post a new message to a forum in several ways depending upon how the administrator has configured the site. When viewing a forum you should see an image button reading New Topic. Clicking on this image button will take you to a form for posting a message or ask you to login first. Depending upon how the administrator has configured the site you may be able to post anonymously, i.e. no login required. If you do not see the New Topic image button you may not have enough permissions – even after logging in – to post a message to the forum even though you are allowed to view the forum.

      <br>
      A user group, also known as a role, is grouping of common users for the purpose of assigning permissions. In addition to common permission assignment a role can also be used to display an image for a user in that role. Roles make the job of administering and moderating the site easier since users can be assigned to roles and then permission applied based on those roles.
