So, I'm in WC and i'm at the Derv Camp. You know the one with the thug. Anyways, I had camped there from the night before. When I logged in the next day, I notice that I had taken a beating and should probably rest up a bit before I slay anymore Dervs. I did the usual look around to see if I was the only one in the area. Looks clear. I rest. Pop! there's a derv. I decide to use my bow and call him over for a bite to eat.OOps, looks like his friends want to come too. I ended up pulling 3 of them. I pulled them away from the camp and start fighting. One down and two to go. At this point, I've got about half my life left but I know I can take these guys. As long as nothing else comes along, i'm good. But wait, whats this?? I can see in the distance between whacks, that a little halfing is pulling the Thug and he's headed right for me. In my head, i'm yelling "no,no, go away, take that guy somewhere else". But he ends up training the Thug right next to me. I see the little halfling come around and sit right smack dab in front of me , looks like he's enjoying the show. Well, a minute or so passes and bingo! i die. That cost me two blues and almost sent me back to 18. I was pretty angry. I made the long run back to retrieve my body and guess who shows up?? The halfling and his cohorts. As i'm recovering my items he's laughing at me and telling me my gear sucks. Well, I choose to ignore him. But he's still going on. "Let's duel" he says. He's a 32 pally and he wants to duel me, a 19 warr ?? I refuse his ridculous offer and go on my way to a safe spot to sit. He follows me and asks me "what's up." I tell him i'm a bit sore that he trained that Thug on me and I don't wish to speak with him. He tells me that" I was going to die anyway". This is just not cool! Never have I encountered such an ass on EQ. I know that this post is a bit long but I had to vent. There was no good reason for this little guy to do what he did. If you had a problem with me pulling those dervs little guy, you could have just told me you were there hiding in the shadows, but instead you resorted to hostility and you lost any chances of gaining a fun loving warrior as a friend. I hope the next person you do this to is a GM or Guide and he/she might whoop your ass and teach you a lesson. Just because you are quite a few levels higher than someone and have better gear or are "Twinked" dosen't mean you are any better of a person.

Next time, catch his name. I assume we can all guess his slightly post-pubescent age. Good people deserve a pat on the back and bad people deserve their reputation.
