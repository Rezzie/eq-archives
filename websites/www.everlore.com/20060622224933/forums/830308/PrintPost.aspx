I saw the article in a game mag about EQ II finally coming after we've waited all this time.  So, what are your hopes both in general and for shadow knights specifically for EQ II?  Here are some of the things I hope to see.  Note I never had the chance to see the effects of AA in game so some of these things may be irrelevant.

In General:

1. Stop sending the monster mages to the warrior gym.  It ticked me off everytime I would see both the mages and the warriors of a race hitting me four times in two seconds for 90 damage a pop.  The mages are already annoying with the spells they keep flinging, we don't need them to be kung fu experts too.

2. Either make bash better at interrupting spells or nerf the monsters' ability to interrupt our spells.  Almost without fail despite having max skill levels any hit from a monster would cause my spells to fizzle while after bashing a mage mob a hundred times in the middle of casting their spells I might interrupt them once if I was lucky.

3. Nerf the melee effectiveness of bards and rangers.  If paladins are supposed to be the defensive hybrid and shadow knights are supposed to be the offensive hybrid then we should be able to out damage these classes without having to blow our entire load of mana casting DOTs and still being outstripped by them in the damage department (rangers).

Shadow Knight Specific

1. Give us better debuffers.  Shadow Knights are meant to be able to cripple their enemy through the use of debuffers and a pet helper.  While the pet helper will almost always be crappy our debuff spells should at least have a noticable effect on the mob.  Repeatedly I would see a mob that wouldn't even break its stride due to my debuffs despite stacking every single one I had that was stackable on the damn thing.  I hope that they expand on the idea of a SK only debuff line and make it effective.  In terms of pets and DOTs I can understand why we have a fourth of the power of necros at our level but in terms of debuffs we should have it at somewhere between a half to three-fourths of a necros power at a given level.

2.  Make SKs a real offensive threat in the game.  I don't mind doing less damage than a Warrior melee-wise, but combined with our spells SKs should be able to due an aprreciable amount of damage by comparison.  I wouldn't mind taking a defense hit in order to do a larger chunk of the damage in combat.  SKs are not poor man's paladins make them the offensive terrors they're supposed to be.

3. More SK specific equipment and quests.  I think all classes should be getting this.  I got sick of the lame quests at the beginning of the game that came around to absolutely no quests for most of the middle of the game and having to wait for the big class specific quests until the end game.  I think it would be cool to have a quest that spanned your entire career as a SK.  Similarly I think more personalized weapons and maybe even a special SK only weapon subtype might be cool.

4. More options for hiding from the guards.  Maybe a disguise skill of some sort.  The absolutely omniscient guards really ticked me off.  The disguise skill wouldn't be perfect, and enchanters would be better at it with their spells but it would add depth to the game and also help with the quest npc x hates your race problem.

/slaps Harok_Nist For saying: 3. Nerf the melee effectiveness of bards and rangers. If paladins are supposed to be the defensive hybrid and shadow knights are supposed to be the offensive hybrid then we should be able to out damage these classes without having to blow our entire load of mana casting DOTs and still being outstripped by them in the damage department (rangers).


 Hehe no Bard or ranger ever Out meleed My Pally or Sk.Either your crazy or you just Suck.

 Btw: Your #1 was corny.They do that so you dont Beat a friggin wizard up in two seconds and he cant land a spell on you.(Shoot i would beat the hell outta you too if you smacked me nd I couldnt get a spell down.)

there is no way in hell an SK kept up with a bard in the higher end of the game, im sorry but you need to shut up and eat it cuz ne bard in your group is casting haste FOR YOU when he could be casting DoTs self haste ... who knows what else, you would be left in the dust be either class with the same amount of AAs and planar gear.

BUT if you werent talking 60+ then your argument holds no case so either way thaxtan ur postn just to do something which isnt all that great
