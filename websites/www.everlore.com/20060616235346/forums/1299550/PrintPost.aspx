I am a Pally of 53 seasons and have read some of the comments on being a Paladin and I have to agree with most of them.

First, it is a difficult class to level.  I know there are those out there that can take any character and get to 30 in just a few days, but I have had days where I worked hard and only got 1 lvl.  You must do like someone said, be a Paladin and love it.  Stick with it.  

Second, I have played other games, i.e. War Craft, and the Paladin was the best fighter in the game.  With this in mind, I do believe that the Sony gods really need to turn the Paladin into a Holy Warrior.  Give him some powerful weapons with easily attainable heavy duty armor and a few really good healing and damage spells.

Third, if you are going to keep your pally, upgrade your armor as quickly as possible.  Also, get temp/virtue and kei along with your own spell of Divine Purpose(which is a mana to hp spell) and become the best tank possible.  I love to do it on a raid or Ldon.

The Paladin is hard to play, because it is not a spellcaster/healer, but not a warrior either.

Good luck and safe hunting.

I have a few questions I'm hoping you have time to answer; I'm a rank newbie Pally (I'm talking level 4 here).  Which, if any, of the epic quests would you recommend I start with?  Are epic quests both solo and group?  I really appreciated your comments BTW on Paladin abilities here as opposed to that class in other RPGs. But I am having fun, which is the point, right?
