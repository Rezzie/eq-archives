I can't find any way to get into the tower. I went all around it and found nothing. I see this one part that's blocked off by ice. I dunno. I'm confused. Can anyone help?

Never been in there myself but i think there is some kind of mirror looking thing that teleports you inside, think it is on the side facing the ocean, but that is a wild guess, never seen it up close, since i'm a bit to low level for it.

Click on the thing that looks like ice and you will be teleported in.  To get out there is a small mirror on the wall where you port in, click on that and you are back outside.

They are both right it is a portal type thing on one side of the tower you click on it and you are teleported in. I go there all the time to get some exp and the 11 plat+ items they drop are nice. Only thing is you have to get they keys to go from floor to floor in the tower the key you get on the 1st floor to go to the 2nd floor is easy to get when you go in you will see a big room with a pit in the middle and 2 grim reaper guys on the opposite side of the room. The thing is that as it was said in a previous post you need lev because the floor in the big room is ice so you slide around. Pull the skeletons out of the pit by standing on the side of the pit and nuking one of they they are just piles of bones till you pull them. When you kill the skeletons sooner or later one of the skeletons will die and in its place will be a undead gnoll that drops the key. The key on the 2nd floor to get 2 the 3rd floor drops off a angry librarian. An angry librarian is a rare spawn that also drops the tracher sellbus and students homework drops off this mob too I think. After you get to the 3rd floor you have to kill a angry cook to get the key for the 4th floor. WARNING!!! The 4th floor is a hell hole of a maze and the mob that drops the key there is the mob that you lose faction with every time you kill something it is hard to get this key and the mob wanders the maze which has 2 floors so even if you are good at tracking even in a maze it will not hlp much. This key is the hardest one to get my friend took about 4 weeks to get this key and I have still not gotten it. If you do get it then the 5th floor is very nice you can get 1k drops there. The 5th floor key drops from mob that will appear at random when any other mob is killed its a grim reaper guy and is pretty hard.As for the mirrors that you use to get from floor to floor thew one on 1st floor is past the grim reapers on the right the mirrior on the left only works if you have all the keys then it brings you to top floor. on the 2nd floor it is all the was across from where you appear as for the 3rd floor I cant explain you have to get someone to show you and the 4th is the same way. Get someone to guide you through the floors the 1st time you go in so that you can learn how to survive like what invis to use on what floors. I really hope this helps you out and I hope you don't die too much like I did on the 4th floor b/c my invis dropped while running through.

"As for the mirrors that you use to get from floor to floor thew one on 1st floor is past the grim reapers on the right the mirrior on the left only works if you have all the keys then it brings you to top floor."

I don't think that's entirely accruate.  You don't need all the keys in order to use the mirror on the left, you just need to have the key to the 7th floor.  Then you can use the mirror on the left (on the first floor) and it will take you up there.

You can get detailed information on each floor and what drops the keys at the EQATLAS site. <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/towerfrozenshadow.html" TARGET="_BLANK">http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/towerfrozenshadow.html</A>
