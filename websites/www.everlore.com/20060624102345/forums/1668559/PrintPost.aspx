Saw some mention of this (new to PVP btw) It seems as though you score points for killing opposing team members - but what points do you get? how many per kill? etc any info would be nice =D

Ok, because (a) I'm a nice guy, and (b) no one else comes here, this is what Verant/Sony posted back when Sullon was new.  I've edited and compiled a bit:

<blockquote>
Sullon Zek point system
Hello all.
I've removed the initial rules from this post and replaced them with the new ones below. There are a few minor changes, as well as a new short FAQ section.


Deity Alliance Score System

- A base number of 100 points are awarded for a PvP kill when the victim is over level 20. Then 2 points are added per level difference of the killer and the victim. Example: If the killer was level 30 and the victim was level 35, the killer would receive 100 pts + (35 - 30) X 2 for 110pts total. If it was the other way around, the score would be 100pts + (30 - 35) X 2 for 90pts.
- There is a soft time limit of 1 hour for PvP kills. This means that killing the same person within the time limit will have diminished returns.
- Killing the same person again within the time limit will reward only 50pts. 25 points for the 3rd kill. Zero points for the 4th kill. And finally -25pts for each additional kill after 4 for the time limit.
- Being killed in PvP combat in the + or 5 level range will result in a loss of 25 points.


Deity Insignias
- Insignias come in 4 flavors. Minor, Normal, Greater, and Superior. Only the first 3 can be obtained by looting. Ten lesser insignias can be combined in a forge to produce a normal insignia. Ten normal insignias can be combined to produce a greater insignia. You then may combine the 10 greater insignias to produce a superior deity token.
- The insignias themselves each have a point value. 1 pt for lesser, 5 pts for normal, 10 pts for greater, and finally 25 pts for a superior.
- The superior tokens can be turned in for ingame rewards. This will be done either by quests or through a GM event.


FAQ:

[PvPer01 says], Say I'm level 40 and this guys that's level 20 has just annoyed me to the point where I kill him a few extra times. Say 3 times within your soft time limit of one hour. How many points would I get for those 3 kills?

Answer: For the first kill you would get 60pts. For the second kill you would get 10pts, and for the 3rd kill you would get 15pts. For a total of 55 pts. The next time, which would be the 4th kill, you would get 40pts. For each additional time that you killed that player, you would get -65pts for each kill. Assuming all these kills were within 1 hour.

[PvPer01 says], How come I lose points when I combine my insignias the forge?

Answer: This is the reason for the point loss. I consider it more of a sacrifice. When we do implement rewards for insignias, the turn in insignia will be one of the higher rank insignias. You must either choose to turn them in for rewards and lose points, or keep the insignias and not get the reward.

[PvPer01 says], Say I quit playing for a while and I have my name on the leader boards for PvP kills. How long will I stay up there?

Answer: You have approx. 30days and then you will be dropped from the boards and your points removed. Basically, if your character remains inactive for 30 days, it's as if you never played on the server.

{Edit - Kharlisht. Following are some other questions they answered.}

Kronx-Zeb wrote:
The real problem here is that points are only awarded for killing players, which I interpret to mean "Who cares about role-playing anymore? Here's Quake with swords."

Of course, it's only on one server so what's the big deal? Well, if it works well, it may spread to other PvP servers, then who knows?

Points just seem an exact contradiction to the nature of EQ. No, we don't know how much mana we have, but we know who's killing the most team members and racking up the points.

I just hope this is presented in the appropriate manner if it crosses to other servers. Indeed, I wouldn't mind getting bonuses for killing a bzillion orcs. I'll probably have to do that anyway, since the questing system is so screwy.

Answer: The points will only be visible outside the game on our site, there won't be any in-game ranking boards (as far as I know), so that should reduce the Quake feeling.

The idea is to encourage PvP. Me, I won't be looking at the point totals (except as required by my job to make sure they actually work), so they probably won't affect my gameplay in any case.

I certainly understand your point. No, I don't think you'll ever see anything like this on a standard server. The Orcs will be keeping their tallies on little notepads or in their heads, but not on a leader board...

Q. Will the insignia's of like type be stackable? If not I just could see inventorys of nothing but insignias. 

Also in the most recent posts it seems to be that you've given up on the idea of insignias being for a team reward. Is this point system to replace that and the insignias will be for personal reward now? I know nothing is final yet, just wondering if the direction it seems things are going are how you think they are going.

Answer: Right now, yes. We're still looking into ways to award the team, but individual point scores are easy enough to do, and don't prevent us from creating team awards. But by far the easiest thing to do is award individuals, and that's the current setup. We've not given up on the idea of team awards yet, though.


This has probably been covered and I just missed it.
Q: Are the insignia stackable?
Q: Will we be able to turn in multiple insignia for greater reward?
Q: What about some unique (to this server) tradeskill items made from the insignia (similar to making a necklace from the ears of your foe)?

Nill
Tribunal

Answer: Yes, sorta... there are several types of insignia (4 for each god) and those will stack (you can stack minor Innoruuk insignia together, but not minor and normal; nor can you stack minor Karana with minor Brell).
Answer: Yes, sorta... Insignia will be combinable. 10 of one will give you the next one up. In fact, you can only get a Superior insignia by combining 10 Greater insignia. It will be an interesting conflict. Do I keep the 10 minor, which are worth more points, or combine them into one normal insignia that takes up less inventory space but worth less points...
Answer: Probably won't be a tradeskill. Probably will be a quest.

Does this point system reward grief play ?

A level 45 makes more points off a 3 man group of level 20's than he does off of pulling a near miracle kill on a level 60. Math is below.

You are level 45

1 level 60 kill = 100 + 15*2 = 130 points + 10 points for a greater insignia = 140

1 level 20 kill = 100 + (-25)*2 = 50 points

So at level 45 you get more exp from taking out a 3 man group of level 20's than you do from one level 60.

Answer: That's true, he would get 20 more points. But no insignia and no cash.

I wonder if that group of 3 20 levels would be harder to kill? I'd be willing to bet that at least one of them gets away...

{Edited - Kharlisht}

Korgarl asked:

Questions:
1. Do you have to strike the killing blow to be awarded the insignia?

Answer: Yes.

We have the Sullon Zek PvP stats page up.
It's very interesting. Go on and take a look...

Well, that's an interesting question.  The points board can be manipulated, I think - at least, I saw a post once by someone claiming to know how to do that. The negative points were supposed to frustrate griefing, but instead for a lot of folks, it promotes it - if you don't care about being the top PvPer, who cares if you bind-camp some 15th level snot?

It's interesting to look at the page from time to time, but I don't think that at an individual level people pay much attention to it.  At a collective - guild - level, it's still useful.  Nice to see when your guild makes the top ten or twenty for the day.

I have read many of the post from all of the PvP servers and found that their is a recuring theme of greif killing, corpse camping, bored level 50+ chars. slaughtering newbs, ect.  I currently have 3 chars. on Sullon all of which are untwinked and newly created.  One of my chars. is a good wood elf ranger so I know first hand what it is to be repeatedly pked by chars. 40 levels higher than me.  When I get pked, it doesn't really bother me unless the frequency of my deaths makes the game unplayable.  When this happens I still dont let it bother me, I simply play one of my other chars.  I was talking with my brother, who also has 3 chars. on Sullon, about some things that could add an iteresting twist to the game and a point came up about practicing skills.  The idea was basically that if you didn't practice a known skill for a long time, you should LOSE skill points in it. Ater all, thats kinda how things work in real life.  i/e if you don't speak your second language, you become less fluent in it.  Well to get back to my original point, what if a high level char. did nothing else in their life but pk people 40 levels lower than they were and didn't do much else to challenge their own development?  I think that they would eventually go soft, perhaps even get a beer belly.  Along these lines, I think that unneccesary greif killing, corpse camping, ect. would slow to a trickle if people lost experience for doing so.  I dont think that they should lose a lot of experience for the occasional pk but they sould lose more as their griefing increases.  Since on Sullon it doesn't seem that points really mean anything, why not turn the top 20 negative points into the top 20 negative experience.  After losing a couple of levels due to casual greifing do you think anyone would continue to do it?  Maybe this would finally change the chars. currently listed on the the top 20 negative points so that I could be greifed by newer and more exciting players. One final note, there would be no experience loss if a fight was instigated by a lowbie.  Anyway, this was just one idea.

"After losing a couple of levels due to casual greifing do you think anyone would continue to do it?"

Yes, if their skills didn't decrease. That was the whole problem with de-levelling - Hit a high level, get Offense, Defense, and 1HS at 150+ or something, then de-level to your teens and kill lowbies all day.  Now, you can only lose something like two levels.

On Sullon, it might be more meaningful to lose a level, however, since there are no level restrictions.  On the other Zeks, de-levelling was a real problem, from what I gather.

Good point! De-leveling to kill lowbies never even occurred to me.  I guess I never had the time nor inclination to do so.  In my experience with de-leveling, I've only noticed that you could lose the ability to cast certain spells.  I guess I just assumed that your skill points would also drop to your level appropriate cap in the unfortunate event that your character lost a level.  If skill points were also lost on PvP servers do you think that would be enough to discourage casual griefing?  Also I want to make it clear that griefing should be alowed in the PvP environment but should also carry some sort of price to the person doing it.
