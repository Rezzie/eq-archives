Now froglocks will be coming out....what team will they be on? i personally think they should start a new team with them and the vah shir....i think its dumb that cats are considered human, and i have no idea what team a froglock would fit onto.

For those that dont know what i am talking about they announced today that they are gonna make froglocks playable.

nebac, frogs will be on the short team because they are short,  go figure. 

so now every team has four members except the elves which was the weakest team all along.

nebac i once posted as krysalis when i used to play on talon. you remember me. i don't even play eq anymore but i was so addicted when i did play that i still check out the boards several times a year and still read up on expansions when they come out, plus my brother plays so i am always exposed to eq.

Anyway, maybe when the elf team gets a new race added to their ranks i'll regain my interest, but until then i'll enjoy life outside of eq. 

Just before I stopped playing i got a friend to play and tried to get him into the one team ideals...

he's been playing for about 4 or 5 months and already has several high level accounts and is trying to get into pande. I used to hang out with this friend very much and now i hardly see him. Every time i see him play i get more disgusted with everquest and the talon zek server.

take it easy nebac, and a little tip for people who have all these ideas for eq, take that creative energy and put it somewhere useful, write a book or something. 

play the stock markets instead of going to the bazaar and use those marketing skills to earn real money. 

work on your own ideals instead of creating ones for your alter ego,

later,
bezzinal
