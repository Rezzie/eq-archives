I have a:
LVL 29 CLERIC
LVL 29 MAGE
LVL 15 RANGER
LVL 30 ROGUE
LVL 25 WARRIOR

I wanted to get a good feel for a handfull of classes then take one, possibly two, into the high end of the game.

I'm looking for any opinions on what class I should choose. I know the whole, only you can decide thing, but I am really having a tough time deciding and would like some input from people that have already been to the high end.

some notes:

CLERIC: Having so much responsibility is cool. Auto-group is also very nice : )/ can get very repetitive.

MAGE: PETS ROCK!!, summoning stuff for people is cool too./it's so annoying how you can't just quickly melee a green mob away if you dont have your pet up or he is occupied.

RANGER: Tracking, Fletching, Archery, TIGHT!!/ kinda tough to find a group.

ROGUE: Hide and sneak is sweet, massive amounts of damage non-stop in a group, BACKSTAB!!/ no soloing capability whatsoever, no spells : (

WARRIOR: Gotta love all the attention you get from being main tank : ), taunting mobs off others and beating them down is very fun, non-stop action/ soloing is pretty much not an option, no spells : (

Theres the notes : )
Any opinions on this would be great, especially end game info, THANKS A BUNCH : )

Ok heres what i would do since i like melee more than magic i would put them in this order

1.Warrior: My hearts are with warrior just because i like to log in and don't worry about mana and go kick some azz.

2.Rougues: I don't find to many rougues and i think they rock and they can deal leathal damage.

3.Cleric: I personally like groups and clerics play a very important part they also can deal nice dd damage and heal for some wicked numbers.

4.Mage: there pets are sweet and there super fun but since i'm not a huge magic guy i put them here

5.Ranger: I know there melee but I would play a drood before them they get lvl 1 spells at 2. I just don't enjoy them much.
            Ok thats my sense on it but its just my opinion since warriors are sweet and look cool i have to give it to them. By the way i need to start my barb warrior soon. My friends gonna give him a lammy.

All of them, so you can keep them in a "2v1 Loop"

I can tell right now that you like spells...so even though I'm a melee-guy, I'm going to say you might as well forget the Warrior and the Rogue.  Not only that, but you mention solo'ing quite a bit, so that's another reason to forget them.

Now, Clerics have tough solo'ing as well...and you're right, they are repetitive.  Keep this one around, but probably not as a main or secondary main.

That leaves Ranger and Mage.  Hybrid and Int Caster.  Not a bad couple of classes, either.

Both of them can solo, albeit the Ranger might have a bit tougher of a time due to being limited to soloing animals only (more on this, however).

Mages - well, I hate playing INT classes.  But that's just me.  They are awesome classes, don't get me wrong, I just can't stand them for me playing them.  Others, with me in a group, are fun as hell...and very important, too.

Your mage is already 29, so you've already dealth with the biggest problem of Int Casters - research.  You don't get all your spells w/o doing research.  It's a PITA (Pain In The Ass).

But, the fact that you're 29 screams to me to keep it. (Another reason I said to keep the cleric...5 more levels to CH, and you can get in almost any group).

I recommend soloing your Mage in Echo Caverns, on Needlites.  Put a DS (Damage Shield) on your pet (my mage newbness is showing - isn't the fire pet auto ds?) and kill needlites until 32/33.  Then head to DSP (Dawnshroud Peaks).

Take your ranger and solo/group in PC.  Everyone can solo to 22-25, though once you hit your low 20s, the bandit camp groups are best.  DPS and Snare are lovely for them, so Rangers should be taken in quickly if spots are open.  If not, then solo the shrooms.

Once mid 20s, take your Ranger to Needlites and use those awesome DS spells, snare, and your DPS to wipe them out to low 30s.  Then go to DSP and, using animal fear spells, solo the Zelniaks to your heart's content (ie around level 40).


[edit: when I say drop your warrior and rogue, I do NOT mean delete them.  You never know when you might want to play them again.  I made my ranger in Feb 2001.  She didn't get played, pretty much at all, during the whole of 2002 or was it 2003?  Almost a year of not even being logged in.  She was in her mid 20s or so.  Now, she is 36 and flying through her levels.]

Out of all of them, the cleric and the mage have the best longevity when compared to what you want at their levels now.  Nothing wrong with the ranger, and they become quite the DPS machines in the upper levels.  But I know mages solo'ing Tier 1 zones with no problem - granted, level 65 with a large number of AA and very decent equipment.

If it were me, I'd pick the cleric.  Get the LoY Temp spell, then sit in the baz and charge 2 peridots for temp while using only one and make some phat cash.

Seriously though, you need to decide how much grouping you will do.  If you stick with cleric or warrior, you are assured a group very quickly in the high end, if that's your bag.  I'd pick rogue if I had a good guild to run with all the time, since you are utterly group/raid melee DPS and that's it.  If you find more fun in soloing or farming tradeskill stuff, go with the mage.  As for the ranger, feh, seems more trouble than it's worth.

Course, I'm a necro, so I'm a little biased. My view on what's a fun class is a little warped since I get a kick out of mobs dying in pitiful ways to my dot's or pet. :)
