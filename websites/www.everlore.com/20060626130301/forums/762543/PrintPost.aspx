First, let me preface this by a) thank you and b) don't take offense if I don't follow what you post.

I'm looking for ideas, and lists of how other paladins are progressing in their AAs.  Erobate finally hit 62 (with a small buffer) and I plan on going 100% AAxp for about 6-12 months (or until I have all the most important AAs).

My current plan is this:

Run Speed 3 - done
Regen 3 - done
Combat Fury 3 - 1 of 3
Natural Durability - 0 of 3
Slay Undead - 0 of 3

I'm wondering if I should switch SU3 and ND3...get Slay Undead first, as it will assist me in getting faster AAs.  ND3 won't, not really.  It'll help in the long run, of course, when tanking.  But in the quick, down and dirty, AAxp grind...SU3 should help more.

Raid buffed, I come in at 5555hp and around 1200 ac (might be a bit higher, I think - I don't pay too close attention to the exact #).  From what I understand, this isn't bad.  No, it's not great, but it's not bad either.  It's just shy of the 6K that a warrior friend had at 60, IIRC.

Anyway, gimme some of the AA orders that you guys did, are doing, will be doing.  Just so I can see how odd my list is in comparison...or if I'm even making a huge mistake somewhere down the line.

Thanks, Teluas...that (and hopefully more from others) is exactly what I was looking for.  What you got, when, and even why.

I don't know half those abbreviations off the top of my head, as AAs are still rather new to me, but it looks like you are going along the exact lines I want to go on.  The steed may come a bit earlier for me, though, as a status symbol. ;)

I'll bring up a list of Paladin AAs (including non-class specific of course) to compare your abbreviations so I know exactly what you meant.

Here's my list in order and why:

-Run 3:  uh, yeah.  Staple item

-Metabolism 3: I use a LOT of stat food, and this makes it so I need to buy it like, once every couple months or so

-CF3: I wanted SU so bad I could taste it... got as prereq

-SU3: See CF3.  I just wanted this skill SO bad.  And I'm glad I got it right away, as my guild spends a lot of time in ssra now

-ND3: NEED those hp's.  If yer in a raiding guild, this is VERY important

-Phys Enhancement: I actually got CS and CA 1 before getting this... was a little more of a boost to all

-Act of Valor (I wanted my title... shush)

-Horse: Best mode of travel in the game IMO... when it works.  /rude SoE

-Planar Durability3: more hp... I was and am still being called on as a OT and even a MT for my guild, so hp hp hp.

-Knight's Advantage 3: With SU3, more swings = more crits = more Slays.  This AA increases double attacks

-Speed of the Knight 3: Gives chance for triple attack.  I got this for the same reason I got KA.  However, since you only get the chance to triple on a successful double, get KA first

-Spell Casting Fury 1 (for fun)

-Combat Agility 3: tanking purposes

-Lightning Reflexes 5: same as CA

-Combat Stability 3: Same as CA and LR

-Working on ID now: See above

If ya look at my magelo, I'm pretty sure that comes close to adding up (too lazy to go add atm... it's late).

Hope that helps. :)

EDIT: Changed abbreviations to full names for most of my entries. :)  Sorry about that Nos.

As an addendum, I definitely recommend metabolism 3.  I use halas 10lb meat Pies and Qeynos Afternoon Tea as my food and drink.  Both are miraculous level, and like I said, they last me well over a month, close to 2.  And I get str, sta, dex, wis, and hp out of those.  Think of it this way... for 3 AA and a bit of pp every month, you basically get the innate str, dex, wis, sta, etc AA skills.

Very worthwhile. :)

Actually, I didn't shrug off Metabolism...it's something I definately want to get.  Nothing more annoying than "You are low on food/drink" messages.

I don't understand your decision to put off leveling for AA points.  Even with casual play, you could be 65th level within a few weeks, and the power gains from that alone would match what you could pick up in a few AA, not to mention open more potential for gaining experience post 65, making AA go even faster.

That's where I disagree...too many thigns are no longer even LB when you hit 65.  I have many more options at 62 and it's just enough to enter BoT.  See below for why "even with casual play, you could be 65th level within a few weeks" doesn't work for me.

Also, AA points for me are more important than 65.  You have to understand a major problem I have, Fletcher, and that's - I don't get to play often and when I do...it's rarely exp grinding (reg exp that is).  I have zero flags.  Why? Not from lack of hoping for a chance to.  I'm just never on when my guild goes after them...and if I won't even join a pick-up group for reg exp, you can assume I wouldn't touch a flagging pick-up group.

Most of the time, I'm helping people farm lbs and dbs for high level tradeskilling.  It would take forever to get the exp to gain a level...however, the aaxp flows like water.

I want those huge hits against undead that SU3 will give me.  The enjoyment of seeing those will override the minor feeling of loss towards not getting 65.  I want to sit astride my summoned horse, more than I want 65.

My normal EQ session goes like this: I log on with my main.  Very few people on (in my guild), they are still at work.  Slowly, people log on.  Usually it's the lower levels or alts playing.  So I'll join them.  The upper levels, they will either not log on or not want to play them.  Therefore we do alts/low levels.  On the days they do want to play their upper levels, it's usually to farm something before heading off to massive exp grindage - that happens after I log off.

If I did pick-up groups...sure, I can see making 65 in about 1.5-2 months.  But I refuse to.  Pick-up groups cause me to get angry, annoyed, or frustrated.  Frustration with others is something I don't handle well.  I get very angry and end up hurting people's feelings.

Bah, I've rambled enough to bore even the scholarly. :)

Yours is probably the only situation I have ever seen that I would agree... AA instead of leveling.

The only problem I can see you bumping into is if you decide to work on some of the PoP aa's.  Some of those have a required level, so you may be blocked in progression at some point.

But, if yer gonna fill out general/arch/class, it doesn't really matter anyways/ :)  So ya... just go at yer own pace and have fun with it. :D

Actually, once I get the gen/arch/class for HP and SU3 (well, ok, maybe my horse, too), I do plan on going back to full regular exp.  I'm not too worried about PoP AAs at the moment.

i don't remember the order in which i got my aa. the only thing i *do* remember is that i didn't get my horse until just recently and SU i didn't get until ldon came out.

i basicly held out on those 2 until the very end. the more important ones i'd say to get is getting CA, CS, ND mainly.. i'd also say go for Improved LH as well it's wonderful. i'll look more at my aa when i get home and give more advice

I did the following:

Run3 (Duh)
Innate Stamina 3 (As a High Elf, I was lacking in this area)

Combat Agility 3 (IMO, this is the best of the 3 archetype tanking aas: ND, CA, CS. Basically, it's better to avoid a hit altogether than to mitigate some of the damage.)

I then went straight to class for Holy Steed, no questions asked. I just had to have it, and I still regard it as the best AA points I ever spent. :)

Back to Arch, got CF3 (everyone needs a little eye candy now and then), ND3, and CS 1, then got Physical Enhancement from Class AAs. PE boosts the bonus you get from CA, CS, and ND, so I put hps and avoidance slightly ahead of mitigation on the priority list.

Threw a quick 3 points into SU1 (the whole eye candy thing again :)), then finished out CS3. Finally, put in the rest of Slay Undead. If this weren't a requirement of the guild I'm applying to, however, I'd probably put it off.

So since then, I've done Lightning Reflexes 1-3 (yay, more avoidance), but I'm saving the last 2 for later. :) I'm currently working on Improved Lay Hands, which will be followed by Hand of Piety and Radiant Cure 1, then back to tanking. (LR4-5, Innate Defense 1-5, Planar Durability 3). At some point, I might throw in Healing Gift 1 for even more eye candy. :P

I haven't really thought much about after all that, but I suppose I'll continue with healing aas, including Hand of Piety 2-3, Healing Adept 3, Healing Gift 3, Hastened Piety, etc.)
