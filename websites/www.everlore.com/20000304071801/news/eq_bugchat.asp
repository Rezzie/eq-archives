<p align="center"><font size="4">Chat Log Part 1</font></p>
<p><br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Our goal for this evening is to help Verant track and understand the problems that we encounter on  a daily basis while playing EverQuest.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> This is NOT an opportunity to flame Verant, nor is it a chat that will answer specific steps to  reproduce bugs.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> If you have experienced a problem in game repeatedly, or if something has recently happened to you
that you can't explain, this is the ideal time to question why the problem occurs.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> We hope that with your help, and with Verant's interest in actively participating in chats like  this, that the development and improvement of EverQuest will always continue.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Now Soy, our moderator this evening, will explain what you need to know to participate.<br>
&lt;soy> Hello Everyone!  Once again I would like to welcome you on behalf of the entire staff at The Dr.TwisTer&nbsp;<br>
  Network.<br>
&lt;soy> My name is Soy, I will be tonight's moderator and would like to discuss the format and procedures for  tonight's Bug Chat.<br>
&lt;soy> Those of you wishing to participate in tonight's chat, and would like to ask a question to one of the  participants, send your messages to any of the users with + signs next to their names.<br>
&lt;soy> This includes : Chosen, Duriel, J, Night, Ravage, RevFluffy, Adambomb and Twiggy-2,<br>
&lt;soy> We have very limited time tonight.  Please keep your questions simple, and try to stick to one topic.<br>
&lt;soy> So that we may fit as many of your questions into the evening.<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Thanks Soy! Adambomb and Twiggy-2,'<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Now if we could ask the folks from Verant to quickly say Hi and let us know who they are.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Abashi> Hello all, I'm Gordon Wrinn, aka Abashi, Internet Relations Manager for Verant.  Greetings!</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Carwasher> HI I am one of the EQ Programmers</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> I'm one of the Game Designers  ;)</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> I'm Robert Hill, Testing Manager for Verant to the first ever Bug Chat. Topics for tonight's chat include current game problems, new problems or bugs, and
future development issues. Please send your questions by /msg to Chosen, Duriel, J, Night, Ravage, RevFluffy or Twig'</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Hutch> I'm Mike Hutchins, Assistant Producer</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Bargash> One of the game designers here.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> I'm Aradune, some guy with a flaming sword others will be able to get soon, I promise.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> (lots of other Verant guys are here too, watching over others' shoulders)</font><br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Well once again, thank you for visiting with us, let's begin.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Narris> Oh and me... I'm narris , EQ network tech..</font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: [Phar(~asd@drtwister.ozemail.com.au)] The zoning bug .. the one that if your low on hp,&nbsp;
(normally trained to zone .. possible dying while zoning) throws you out of the bounds of the map, in  lavastorm this results in a death in lava<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Carwasher> We are looking into that bug, we put in some changes to try and reduce the problem, but we  cannot reproduce it at all locally.. we believe it is related to older AMD and some Cyrix Processors.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Carwasher> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: &lt;Night> How long will it be until the Temple of Solusek Ro armor quests will be revamped?  Most clerics I know are getting a bit irritated at having to camp rare drops on rare spawns, and you said you  were looking into it... (cont.)<br>
&lt;soy> &lt;Night> I seem to recall a post from Gordon stating that you didn't want random spawns, as someting might
spawn every minute, or never again....  But if this is the case, why the rare drop on a rare spawn?  Several  clerics have camped various quest armor
monsters(babbinsport/Gull/Bilge) for days of online time without  seeing the rare monster even once.  It seems to be exactly the same thing, but with a much longer minimum  spawn time. :)<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Abashi> These quests are currently being revamped by our Live Team, and changes should be going in over the  next few patches.  Several things will be done that I'm not prepared to comment specificially on.  As a note,  we need to keep the subject here to bugs.  This is really a design issue.  &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: [Kaiser(Kaiser@drtwister.home.com)] why do monsters "poof" meaning, when you fight them, they  go to run, then all of a sudden they are gone.  There are several places in eq that this happens<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Carwasher> That is a known bug that is being worked on. It has to do with the pathing algorithm used.  No  specific date on when it wll be fixed. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: [Jarax-40Pal-Quellious:not@drtwister.rdr.net] Can you Please Make an Inquiry about the  Packetloss at Primetime. It doesnt matter if Modem or T3 the big lag spikes still sweep the servers<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> I'll take this one</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> Basically, the Packet Loss you see at Primetime is in almost every case the result of Peering Points  of ISP's being flooded</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> We keep a really close eye on our routers and those along the points of our ISP's, and they stay  fairly clean</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> the packet loss you can see is usually attributed to different ISP's simply not having enough  bandwidth</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> I know that isn't the popular answer</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> but it is accurate</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> and those of you that say "CERFNET SUCKS" or "UUNET SUCKS" the bottom line is that whatever ISP we  use,</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> when you have this many people on it can drag down different parts of the Net</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Smed> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Bodkin* Hate Plane is currently bugged to all hell due to poor pathing with mob pets, pets  get stuck from across the zone and pull massive trains with them when pulled to any spot. Given that GM's are  not allowed to interfere with the planes, how do you suggest avoiding this technical error without the "die  until its safe" method?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> We will continue to work with the pathing in PoH, but there is only so much we can do given the  geometry of the zone.  It will just continue to get incrementally better as we tune it. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Uthen* Some quests such as the Kelethin to Freeport mail run sometimes do not work at all,  the NPC just says 'Thank you' and there is no faction change.<br>
&lt;soy> Note: Do not message soy, you will be ignored.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> E-mail rhill@verant.com - But the last time we checked</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> The quests all worked.  The only time that we experienced problems</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> Was when we turned in the mail to the wrong NPC.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> &lt;end></font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> We will double check it ourselves - but please do e-mail rhill@verant.com</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Uthen* Will pathing be implemented for NPCs such that they return to their shop or wherever  after they are done chasing a player or other NPC?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> &lt;Pathing guy stepping in here> The nature of a wide open zone hinders them from correctly  pathing back to their shop.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> We are currently working on a fix - if you know of a specific NPC and their names, we would  appreciate getting them e-mailed to rhill@verant.com</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> for the tiny percent that don't work</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Ramagh* charm/fear bug (also noticed with intensive begging): after breaking charm or fear,  the interface sometimes doesn't answer for some time (hotkeys or mouse clicks), leading to some (frustrating)  untimely deaths<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> We haven't been able to reproduce this since the last fix. Please e-mail specifics you have,  including hardware specs at rhill@verant.com</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> We'll check into it again.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Murgos* When an Ogre uses a mask of the deceiver a minor bug occurs that when someone zones  in after the mask has been activiated the illusioned person appears as an ogre sized dark elf. Are there any  plans to fix this bug?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Carwasher> We will look into the ogre sized dk elf bug, sounds easy to reproduce if so we will fix it after  next patch.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Carwasher> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Bodkin* Cazic Thule used to be a work of art, excellent pathing and reasonable difficulty...  now when I go back there with my twink its turned into a living hell of trains and mob-warping, has Cazic  Thule ( the zone ) been silently altered in any recent patches?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> We haven't made any changes to Cazic pathing in over 5 months, but we will look into this. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Murten* Anything being done about Group bugs? Usually occurs when a member goes LD or when  members disband while another member is zoning. results in players not being able to join/invite. Only fix  now is to camp...<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> We acknowledge that bug and think we can reproduce it -- should be fixed soon. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Mercenary* Have they fixed that bug that when you zone as soon as you die, your corpse will  appear in random parts of the zone?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> That is not a bug - that means that when you zoned, your corpse somehow ended up out of the world</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> We instead dump it back to a "safe point" - always the same point in every zone</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Phar* I would like to bring up the mass zoning linkdead bug. The one that happens alot in the  planes where if 12 or more people zone in roughly the same time, everyone in the zone goes linkdead.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> We made a change recently to help this problem for people with fast connections, but are still  working on a way to handle this for slower connections -- there's simply a LOT of information going through  to people's machines. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: &lt;_HellMngr> What is your response to ShowEQ and what do you intend to do about the problem it  presents?  Will people who release new versions be harrassed legally?  Why was this allowed to occur when you  were warned prior about the weak security in your network protocol and even had the UO people to talk about  it happening, as UO Extreme was already out and being dealt with by OSI.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> We are aware of the program and are taking measures to deal with it, both legally and with our  client and server programs. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Murgos* On the pvp teams server Monks Bards and Rogues are still capable fearing hostile team  members through the use of spells or skils despite that a recent patch msg claimed that fearing (and  charming) of PC's would not be allowed on the pvp team servers.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> That is an honest to god bug - thanks.  We are currently in the process of fixing it,</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> and it should be live, not on this patch, but on the next one</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_GeoffreyZ> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Devastator* Is Verant aware that Fear's drop rate wasn't increased after the "enhancing"  plane drop patch, yet hate was.  Fear still drops around 5-10 things on a full clearing.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Abashi> It's apparent that we forgot (*blush*) to export the data.  We are also looking into issues  surrounding rareness and spawntimes on the zones.  We'll see improvement in the next patch.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Abashi> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Questioon: *Eth* In Nagafens Lair often times you can not see several people, they are there, you can  trade with them (if they bring up the window), but you can't physically see them, going to be fixed?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> Sometimes when there are lag spikes for whatever reason, and if the client hasn't heard from  another player for a while, it will cease drawing that player. Not much we can do about that.  &lt;end></font><br>

<p align="center"><font size="4">Chat Log Part 2</font></p>

<p>&lt;DrTwisTer> We are going to get started again.  Sorry for the down time, please resubmit your questions.&nbsp;<br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Nox* rogues when using poison have to pause for a while because the poison application gets interrupted as if it were a spell, is this going to be fixed soon?  Rogues move around a lot =)<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> We currently have a fix that is being tested.  There is always a small chance of interruption.  We did limit this to as little as possible.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> So it will happen very infrequently.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Zazan> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> *Rogue_42* what is the current status on rogues fixes, like button locks, bard songs effect on hide/sneak, hide/sneak on zoning and camping.. and skill issues like picklock, and non pickable locked doors. and what is to be done with the trap skills?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> a couple of different questions there; I'll get a couple</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> picklock works fine and there will be many more locked doors with no keys in the Expansion</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> the trap skills are not broken, but there are issues with traps that we have no short term plans of addressing</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> hide/sneak is not meant to stay after camping/zoning</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> we'll look into the bard song issue -- we're undecided about it at this point.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> *mixoplix* why is mob pathing so much better than pet pathing?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> It should be identical -- if someone has an example otherwise, please email us the details. &lt;end></font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> that said, pets who are not 'mad' at you may take a more round about way of following you than an NPC who is 'mad' at you. but it is the same AI routines and pathing &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> *whit* any fix due for the /consent command to keep it from being used by corpse looters who run off with your stuff?  How about a "/consent drag name" option to allow someone to just drag your corpse to safety?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> that's not a bug, but we did talk about it, and feel the 'trust' issue should be the same in both cases and we don't plan on adding another /consent variant. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Sam* When you're invisible and a spell (like clarity) is cast on you, or a bard is in the party singing a song, your invisibility goes away-- even though the icon is still on the screen. Basically, monsters can see you while players can't. Why is that?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> it's a known bug and on the list to be fixed. &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Nox*  if you get hit by a bard spell, even one that is an offensive spell that you cannot be affected by it makes you visible (now I am uncertain) assuming I am not mistaken, how about giving us this fix?<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> same answer &lt;end></font><br>
&lt;soy> Next question will be the last question.<br>
&lt;soy> Question: *Narciss* Hello Aradune, I was wondering what you are planning to do about the spectre cave in Feerott. No one can fight them... and when you run they have skipping problems.<br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> Our pathing game designer will look into the Spectre tunnels and see if he can figure out what's wrong. &lt;end></font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> ok, all, thanks much for coming.  we look forward to doing more of these in the future.</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Aradune> thanks!</font><br>
<font color="blue">&lt;EQ_Bargash> Thanks</font><br>
&lt;soy> I'll let dr. twister wrap it up!<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Well thank you everyone for coming.  Thank you to Verant for their time.  We look forward to seeing more chats in the future.  If you have questions or comments, please email me at drtwister@drtwister.com otherwise, the log will be posted later at http://eq.drtwister.com<br>
&lt;DrTwisTer> Thank you again.</p>
