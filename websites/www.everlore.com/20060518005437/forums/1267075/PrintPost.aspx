I'd like to offer some of my own knoledge of jewelry Crafting. This trade skill is THE skill to have in the game.

(all Classes can make jewelry but enchanters will probable end up making more money then other class making Jewelry, due to the fact that enchanters can lower there service price much more then others cause, most other classes have to pay enchanters to enchant there metal, and would end up going in the hole if they lowered there Jc prices to enchanter standards)

but if your a non-enchanter and have a good money resource other then JC, by all means JC away.

 Making the supply naturally lower than say smithing.. Less supply of quality jewlery means higher prices, and profits. Where else can you consistiently make a 33-50% profit per item made?

Now, in the "silver" phase, the beginning enchanter is in the mode of investment for the future, early silver jewlery is not that easy to sell because most low level characters are in the same boat as you are, no money yet.. So, don't bother enchanting metal that you use to make the early jewlery, it just wastes time. As you probably already now know, sell it back to the merchants. You won't make a profit here, but the key is the skill gain.. 

With that in mind, all you have to do now is find some source of cash to fund your fledgling craft. i had a farely good cash flow for a newbie in 
g-faydark/crushbone gathering cb (crush bone) belts and pads from orc Centrons and orc legenairs. and selling them to newbie/lowbie players 1pp each for belts and 2pp each for pads so they can go do an exp. quest in kaladim

 if you are lets say... an evil race and a highly intelligent enchanter, you should be able to find some kind of cash flow.

From one enchanter to another, I hope you hang with it, and someday you will thank me.

also i found an awsome Sight today on one of theese posts for a jewelry crafting guide at
