Who would you fight against a Beastlord ? The warder or the beastlord ?
How much damage a beastlord pet do at lev 15 ?
Well read on, never had so much fun in PvP than with my beastlord so far :)

After lev 15, the proc of the pet is just awesome  basically PvP is simple, whether you do melee / Heal pet if the opponent is an intelligent one who understood the pet was the real threat at my level, whether you heal yourself and run letting the pet kill your opponent when he'ss notice the "blue" pet is casting DD for over 65 in dmg 

After I killed at lev 16 a lev 15 Ogre sk (really easy sk's for a beastlord  ), I had a DE caster coming in invis mode around me while I was medding  Well he said things like "hummm, yummy !" while inspecting me. Then he appeared and attacked ...
He was over lev 20 (had his surname) necro , was a 16 untwinked vah shir beastlord. Basically was so sure of himself he did not summon his skel pet  So he dotted me, dqrkness etc ... while the pet was attacking him. After a few proc ( DD) fro, the pet, the necro was already starting lifespike on me as he was around & bubble of life when I was still at about 50%. Qt that time, I offered to stop the fight and made my pet back off (could have won interrupting his spells but also palying darks and did not want to get him looking stupid with his friends around when he came first to show off  ).
But well, as soon as I ordered my pet to back off, he did cast again some lifespike on me to get some life back and then did choose to go on with attaking me :/
After these two more lifespike from a lev 20 necro, my life was running quite low and finally deciding to run towards the nearest zone (Necro's haven't DD  ). 

All the time, the necro's NEVER did pay any attention to my pet who did basically 80% of the dammage and DD. While I was running away, the necro ran after me a little while but then had to stop as his life was running low again (pet). He then did choose to get rid of the pet and to let me escape BUT .... the pet (green at lev 20 ) wqs still full life when he wasn't and a few DD proc later , had the message "Tiote's warder killed the necro" and was fun to come back ans say hi to the the darks who called their lev 20 plus friend to get rid of me  No one attacked hehe 

So Beastlord sucks in PvP, do not think so, it's just easy, the pet do not suck in PvP as most other pet class, we can easily heal the pet, we are 70% of a monk who can buff, and we can reduce downtime healing.

PvP was really nice without twinking, now I spent about 35k pp in gear for Fiavy, gave 35k to my friend Flavy and we are going to test these new lev 1 char (Beast / Drood ) around Qeynos tonight .

Beastlord rocks !

BEatlords rock in PvP, i have fought a few tand the are pretty good, but saying an SK is easy to a BST? heh, I play an sk while i have fought a few BST's i have never died to one, the only time i went below 2 bubs before killing one is when i had a mag on me too, and the mag did far more dmg than the BST, many  SK's are dumb though, every time i fight a BST i fear the pet, then it's all downhill for my victim. The first fight i had with a BST was when i was 16 and he was 20, i feared the pet and had done 2 bubs to him before he realized what had happened. =)
i will however say that Beastlord is the best non-twinked class to pk with.  That can't even be argued with.
So i choose to hit the beastlord, not the pet.

yes, sorry should not have said sk were easy but it's right I only met some easy one's :)
But well my tactic is simple, I never fight without my pet. Pet is there, I fight, no pet I run (with some variants depending of the level of my ennemy :) )
If you succeed to ca a fear on my pet, won't wait for it to come back, I'll whether run on its side or hit "go away" and summon a new one, specially now that I'm a 40k twink :)
Basically doing so, I killed the 4 sk I did meet so far around EC, it's right none of them had their HT up. But against anyone trying to root/snare/mez/fear etc... your pet, summoning a new one is possible during the fight, as well as the proc and doing so will perhaps make you use your mana but 1) you do not really need it in PvP anyway and 2) it will force the ennemy to use some more mana on your pet again and this will be less damage on you.

When things turn bad, just play as a necro, run around your pet and try to live long enough for the pet to kill your ennemy, the pet will show you who is the real warder :)

Fiavy the Beastlord 
always grouped with Flavy the drood
