I started EQ in Oct of 99. I was told "play a Necro, they are the most powerful class!". I started as a Necro, got tired of nerfs, then somehow I stupidly started my Ogre warrior in December, more as a distraction than anything else.
   Verant (then) could care less that a 49 necro pet could whip ANY warrior, except an Ogre warrior, in full Indocolite, with FBSS, and 2 YK's (NO Warrior existed at this time that met those requirements!).
Verant didn't care that no one wanted a warrior in a group, because they could solo for more exp.
   Kunark, glorious Kunark was then brought out, Warriors finally began to shine. Then it seemed Sony was hell bent to screw the warrior class up again.
    Now a sit-in is finally brought up, I had bitched enough between beginning this game, took a break in Kunark (cause Warrior was finally almost perfect), to restarting again complaining, to getting and banned from 3 message boards for shouting the truth! 
    I sold my warrior and his equipment for nearly $1000, just before the roof fell in. Paladins MT time, Paladins and SKs get all the groups. The same classes that soloed for 50+ levels, while Warriors can solo for 15! 
    Don't buy this crap, that Sony will fix warriors. They don't understand the mechanics of their own game enough to fix anything. Go ahead and de-install EQ, as I have, and wait for another game. Or quit online gaming, as a waste of time/money.

And you wonder why you were banned.  You aren't spouting the truth, you are spouting your opinion...and in a trolling manner.

More importantly, and probably the main reason I have zero respect for you - <I>I sold my warrior and his equipment for nearly $1000...</i>

I literally have to stop myself from flaming you to hell for your stupidity.  You have no idea how the game it now, because you don't play.

Lastly, you obviously haven't been paying attention to the EQ world when you say, "<I>don't understand the mechanics of their own game enough to fix anything.</i>"

So, I end with this...take your trolling elsewhere (if there's anywhere else you haven't already been banned from).
