Good Enchanters are extremely competitive, but you'd never know it from the way we act.  Why?

We're cool under fire.  If we weren't we'd wash out around level 30 or so.

We don't lose our temper (much).  If we did we'd wash out around level 49.

We're good communicators.  I was terse; others are chatty, but we all get our message across, or we wash out around level 30.

We tend to have fast reflexes and are often hyperactive in RL.  This isn't strictly necessary for survival, though.  Slow Enchanters get yelled at and complained about a lot, but don't seem to actually wash out.

The question, 2 years after giving away my account and never even thinking about the game again until today, the question that brought me here is, "Why are we so competitive?"

I was driven to be The Best, and I was shocked to discover I was not alone in that regard.  The other "good" Enchanters weren't born that way; they were pushing themselves just like me.  We all tried to hide it, another thing that baffles me, and we do a hell of a job hiding it, but we were all clandestinely measuring ourselves against each other, straining to be The One They Talk About when the topic of Enchanters is broached.

Why?  I'm not like that in RL -- "good enough" has always been, well, good enough.

It's not as though Enchanters can't tell if they're good enough.  If you're good, you know it.  Maybe modesty keeps you from admitting it, but you know if you're good.  This isn't the sort of job you can screw up and not know it.  What you DON'T know is how good the other Enchanters are.

Others in the group start idle chatter about so-and-so Enchanter, and it's all you can do to keep quiet, when you want to pump them for information:  who is faster, do they move around a lot or stand in place, are they good, and -- more to the point -- are they better than me?  (I was a move-arounder, FYI, and always wondered whether the stand-stillers who were called "good" had some kind of edge I didn't know about ...)

But I never asked any question more direct than, "How'd you guys make out?" (hoping they'd talk about the Enchanter).  If they knew I was "keeping score" they would think I was arrogant, and that would be bad for morale.  "Good" Enchanters don't worry about things like that.  They just ARE.  So I kept quiet.

Honestly we really are in a kind of "rapture" when we do our thing, a constant press of pounding awareness, an immersion that transcends the game genre's "escapist" model.  It's more like an altered state of consciousness.  (When this "natural high" wore off, as one expects of all such things, I stopped playing and found a new hobby.)

But even the intensity of the experience, the purity of focus channeling every concious thought into situational awareness, the almost terrifying pleasure that came day after day hitting the same dungeons over and over (there are only so many), didn't wash away that competitive urge, that starved hunger to be The Best, that worry that I didn't measure up, that someone else's name was being bandied about instead of mine.

When I hit 60 I started doing AE groups, which means making close friendships with other Enchanters, good ones, and that "who's better?" meme mutated into "who should I group with?"  It was only then I learned that I wasn't the only one who waged a secret war for supremacy.  It seems to be a common condition.

Why?

It's been 2 years, maybe more, since I have even thought about this game, but I thought about it tonight, and this is the question that percolated up and nagged at me until I decided to ask it here.

Why are Enchanters so competitive, and why do they keep that competitive streak hidden?

Mr. Unregistered Guest, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

The same thing could be said about pornstars and midgets.

Though I am neither, both are very competitive.

Only the midget that becomes a pornstar is the real winner.

Never forget that!

Dolphins are said to jump out of the water when sharks are near...if you see a dolphin jump out of the water, look out for sharks!

No, seriously...all of you ppl who said the person who posted this was insane...they're really not.  Lol. There is some truth to it.  Hate to break it to ya...read it more carefully if you are an enchanter, it'll come to you.
