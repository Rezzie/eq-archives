I am a level 12 mage and to put it bluntly I am bored.

I am High Elf so started in Felwithe/Faydark area. I am untwinked, I have done the armour quest including getting the unhelpful staff just to have something to do but what do I do now?   I have searched the web looking to see what quests I can take on but most available to my level just give me items I cannot use and the Mage quests are for players at a much higher level.

I suppose it boils down to two questions

1) Are there quests that are worth a level 12 High Elf Mage doing anywhere on the map?

2) Are there places I can go to kill mobs to better armour or weapons?  I know I can get a better dagger (Dragoon) off D'Vinn in crushbone when I a few levels higher.  Any other suggestions?

BTW, I have about 100pp and do not own any expansions yet. Actually I am still on the 30 day trial which is why I am asking; so far I have been kept glued to the PC playing EQ but now as my trial subscription is about to die I have reached a dull patch. Bad timing :)   Maybe Sony should give a bit of thought to how high a player is likely to have gone after 30 days and whether the game is still gripping enough at that level to make them subscribe.

Woot old School. :)

When I was level 16 I did the Band of Rodcet Knife quest. (+3 Int + 10 mana) You should have no problem doing it at level 12.  Do the quest without getting someone else to kill a fish for you and its kind of cool. 

The way it works.  Go To Surefall Glade and talk to the general there.  Get a Nitrates potion (sp).  Take the potion and walk to Ak'Anon.  (Yes with out PoP thats a long walk but kind of fun).  Give the potion to the zoo keeper down below the zoo in Ak'Anon and he will give you the potion of regurgetronics.  Walk back to West Karana and give the potion to Frosty the wolf at the barbarrian fishing camp. He'll give you a fish.  Take the fish back to the temple of rodcet knife.  

Make sure you have amiable or above faction with the quest giver before giving him the fish our he'll eat it and you won't gain anything in return.  If you need to raise your faction you can do the bandit sash quest also located in Qeynos.

There are a lot of other old quests.  The rewards are no longer worth the time with the mudflation of pricing but they are fun to do.  

Good luck

Thanks,  That sounds interesting.  It *will* be a lot of walking but I don't have any other appointments :)
I have to say I am baffled as to why Sony gave us the instant travel of PoP!

Rob... I just gotta say... LEVEL MAN!  12 is NOT the pinnacle of EQ, TRUST ME!  Get to at least 40.  That is when the fun quests start.  Or 46 is planal.  You don't HAVE to equipt your guys to BTW.  I went from 1-20 with my druid just hard leveling.  By 20 he had, Velium Round Shield, Turtle Shell Cap and Velium Morning Star.  At 12 you should be focusing on leveling.  Trust me 30 days you should be to at least level 20.  I go from 1-15 in less then 2 hours.
