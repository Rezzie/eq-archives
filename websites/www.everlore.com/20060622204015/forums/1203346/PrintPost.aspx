Nos it was an innocent post and if you think I'm a complaining, stupid, whinny pk then obviously you're no genius yourself. If I had enough intelligence to figure out half the things I did on RZ then obviously I wouldn't be dummy. And where in my posts do you take  me to be a whiny pk? How did i "troll" you. I don't get that from my replies. "whiny thread"? You put me in the same class as those who "haven't a shread of intelligence" and people around me "go insane"? Come on you're just looking for the nitty gritty and not finding it so you're making shit up and assuming things without proof.
You just dont like me, just admit it. Did I grief you in gfay when I was level 10 years ago or what. 

"Your post was fine, until you decided to troll me and the board in general. Now, I get the pleasure of locking another useless, whiny thread on a PK server forum. It's odd how those tend to pop up mostly on PK server forums. Maybe because a large percentage of the population of PK servers are whiny, useless members of Everquest. I pity those PK members who actually have a shread of intelligence, as they must go insanse dealing with you lot."

Its roleplaying anti-pk's on rallos zek like you who made RZ fun, thanks for playing with us and thanks for the loot ;D

You crack me up.  You really have no idea how wrong you are, do you?

First - I've never played on a PvP server.  Why?  Because I know I wouldn't like it.  I've seen enough to know that there are too many people like yourself there.  So, no, you didn't Pk me in Gfay.  And no, you didn't take any loot from me.

You assume I don't like you.  Well, that's probably not too far off...but only because you're a pain in the ass here on Everlore.  Has nothing, absolutely nothing, to do with EQ or PvP.

I don't stereotype as far as you think I do.  You'd be surprised just how many PvP players are extremely annoying.  I know now everyone who is PvP is, but the majority are.  It takes a certain mindset to enjoy PvP w/o becoming an ass...very, very, very few people can do it.  There's a person in the Main Hall who can, unfortunately I don't recall his name.

You trolled me by specifically attacking me.  Your thread was "whiny" because, besides the attacks on me, that's all it was.  "Why did you lock my thread?" Waaah.

Look, I'm done.  I told you in the last thread, and I'll tell you one more time.  If all you want to do is complain about your thread(s) being locked, then e-mail me.  Though, I'll be honest with you...I'll probably ignore you there.  However, you keep posting threads just to complain about the lock(s)...I'll keep locking the new threads.

Warning, though...one more, and I'm banning you.  Not even suspending...banning, permanently.  I have no patience with unregistered jackasses who can't follow the rules.  And, I've already given you plenty of "get out of jail (read suspension) free" cards.

Deal with it and grow up.
