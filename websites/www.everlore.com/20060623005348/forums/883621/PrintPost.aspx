I apologise if this has been asked before. My main is a Shammy - yup he's cool and I like him heaps. I created a SK to specifically play with one person and got addicted to the amount of damage they could do when in front of a mob compared to my shammy who does most of his damage with spells/pets etc. So I decided to make another melee character to play when my SK was unable to play with my other character. As I mentioned, doing some damage was my main aim so I decided to go for an Ogre for the Strength/Stamina thing... also I had grouped with a couple of real characters who roleplayed their Warriors fantastically and I liked that idead.

So my L12 Warrior is running around with massive strength and not alot of intelligence (he get's distracted by shiny things very frequently)... my question is, should my weapon skills be raising very slowly? I'm only soloing atm until I get to L15 when I plan on getting him to go into LDoN adv. I'm using 2hb mostly at the moment as I got one of the steel rods from the 5th Anviersery - the 40 dmg life proc is great for a class that can't heal themselves except through bind wounds. His Weapon skills in 2hb is currently sitting at 32 (I think, low 30's anyway) and I just seem to remember my SK raising those skills alot quicker. I expected a little bit slower raising of these skills and I imagine this is normal but it seems to be such a slog to raise just one point... is there anything I can do to help this? Should be going back to pok to get a mind buff before heading back into the wilderness?

Thanks in advance.

INT does have a huge link to raising weapon skills.  But, it isn't abnormal for weapon skills to move slowly in your low levels.  Just keep at it.

Dex raises weapon skills faster. I have never heard about int raising weapon skills.

You can't get LDoN until level 20.  At least not that I know of.

In my experience, Dex alone will increase weapon skills for a warrior...although ive noticed i have more successes with my fletching when my Str is maxed; some high-level shammy buffs give me 255 Str and Dex, then my skills go up AND i get alot of arrows to pull with =P

 I had the same problem with 2hb...i was in my low 50's and all my other weapon skills were maxed for my level, so i picked up a Greatstaff of Thunder(saw it for 85pp in the bazaar what a steal!), switched some equipment around (i keep a few Dex-increasing items in the bank for this)and got some buffs from a shammy friend to max out my other stats(can't hurt, right?)...then my friend and guild leader(a 65 mage) summoned a pet and i /duel'd...got some heals from a cleric friend(mage pets are tough!) and within the hour my skill was maxxed for my level! (i also 'primed' the skill with about ten points in training just before...maybe its just placebo but it seems to help)

 So, if you have the Dex and a few friends with time to kill, you can use the method above. It worked for me!

Seriously?  I would have sworn it was INT.  Will have to look into this.

As for LDON...you can, conceivably, get into an LDON at 15.  As long as all 5 of the other members are level 22, that is.  The goal, is to get an average level of 20+.  Since you can't group with anyone 7 levels higher, 15 is where it works out to be.  Also, you get the message about your LDON stone at level 15, IIRC.  But I could be wrong about that last part.

My INT and WIS are both horribly low, but my weapon skills are maxed for my level...tradeskills are a different story though...ive had old-school warriors tell me that Str acts for us on tradeskills like INT/WIS does for other classes...but ive seen no evidence...not enough time to test it myself, i set aside certain time for tradeskilling, and i always have Fo7 or somesuch buff on when i do it.

 Thanks for the info on LDoN, that's good to know...maybe i can coerce some guildies to bring in low level alts with my newb toons =)

Tradeskills are stat specific.  All work with INT/WIS, whichever is higher.  However, some have tertiary stats...such as STR for Blacksmithing, DEX for Fletching and, I think, Jewelcraft.

Thats why this board is dead, you can find all manner of misinformation here. DEXTERITY is what affects weapon skill ups. There have been multiple posts about this, look up answers by Axem or EQ_Warlord.

If you say so...this is a community, where people discuss stuff.  I was wrong, and it was corrected.  This board is suffering a slow down, because it's not needed nearly as much.  People go to one of the many other sites instead.  All the excellent class specific sites, for example.

all i can say on the subject of INT vs DEX for weapon skill ups is this.

a gnome warrior with a much higher base INT and about the same DEX as an Ogre will get weapon skill ups about 3x faster.

the only conclusion is simple math.  higher INT = faster weapon skill up.

DEX = proc rate from what i have seen.  esspecialy with my bard.  with a large amount of ranger or monks in group with proc weapons i would sing my dex buff/debuff song and the procs would jump out the roof.  


56 bard
61 nec
37 war (both ogre and gnome)

so that is what i have seen.

Purely personal experience, but I came to the same conclusion that INT does factor into weapon skillups.  I have a dark elf SK who as soon as he levels bumps up all his skills very quickly, compared to a couple barbarian melee types I play that are very slow to learn.

DEX is pretty much the stat for procs, among other things.  Once you've been buffed with Boon of the Garou you'll see.

/em looks around to see if he's still on Warrior Forum...thinks that INT might indeed help weapon skill-up's for a SK...wonders what SK skill-ups have to do with WARRIOR weapon skills...shakes head, decides to leave the matter to those with the cognitive capacity to figure this sort of thing out; goes back to perfecting his 2hb...

Wanna raise your weapon skills?  Theres a named mob in SRO, a woman, cant remember her name.  Shes level 60 + and sortof a rare spawn.  She will not attack anyone, even if she is attacked.  Just go up to her and hack away, she will reposte for about (150), so attack from behind.  I got my piercing from 1 - 200 in about 1 hour.  The higher the dex the faster it will go.  The faster the weapon the faster it will go.

Another excellent way to raise your weapon skills is to go to a higher level zone and ooc that you would like to beat on a groups mobs for no exp/loot.  Let them know you are just trying to raise weapon skills.  As long as you dont cause the group any trouble they will usually let you beat on their mobs.

I've heard of a mob in Paineel that HT's once, then only hits for max 19, yet is probably about 30-40 in level.  Often referred to as the "dummy".  Does this guy still exsist or has he been fixed?
