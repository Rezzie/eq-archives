12.31.02 - Tholuxe Paells server

Last night we went to the City of Mist for my shaman Epic (i had to kill Lord Ghiosk who spawn from reavers). We engaged 1 reaver who chain respawn...67 (yes, sixty seven) times, all this started from a single reaver ! Lord Ghiosk spawned on the 5th reaver, along with a new reaver. I went there with 10 people from guild, all lvl 55 to 65. From those 67 unstoppable respawn chain, we only had a single member who died around the 30th reaver (a blind wizard, went down in 3 sec).

So, be warned that when  you pull a single reaver you can, in fact, pull an entire chain (thought they will come 1 by 1). Groups who don't bring in CoM the forces i had the chance to bring with me can avoid such a situation by having a wizard/druid having an evac ready so if Lord Ghiosk spawn along with a new reaver, let the shaman loot his 3 books then evac :-)

Also, notice that the reavers are unslowable and will resist ALL spells requiering ANY resist check (spells without check will land). 

Last, keep in mind that the reavers have the abilty to blind you, and it will happen at least once each fight on each people meleing them. For your information, we looted 7 Jade Reavers and 1 Shimmering Partisan out of this 67 respawn chain. Even if they usualy dont respawn more than 4/5 times, keep this info in mind for your futur raids in the CoM.

HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE !

67 times? geez thats alot of Reavers we got lucky when I did mine managed to get him on the way to Rak for another shaman's epic, I don't think he lasted more than a minute =).

  Just a suggestion for anyone going to do Rak hes easily done with 1 group

The shaman handing in the epic tear( to trigger aggro) Now people say you are supposed to die when you hand it in but I managed to live.

2 Mage fire pets perferably as close to lvl 60 as possible(I did mine before the PoP)
 2 50-60 clerics for healing.  

This is all it took to down Rak himself I had others with me to help get there but once we got him spawned he  went down rather quick even ch'd himself once.  Near the end we jumped him and finished it off but the fire pets made quick work of him.  

Again really easy since Rak shouldn't aggro the clerics if they are healing the pets just as long as no one tries to heal the shaman Rak will not aggro. Final battle maybe took 5 minutes tops 

sorry had to put that there )
