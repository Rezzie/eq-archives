This is only a personal observation but here is an excellent idea for all. I run a guild of over 100 on the Solusek Ro server, and I am finding that unless main tank in the guild IS soloing, at higher levels there is little to NO time whatsoever for the tank to fletch. If you have any luck getting your main tank to sit down please let me know how as I can hardly get mine to sit still for a heal that is much needed. Since the biggest joke/complaint I hear on any server is about sitting casters then try this out.
Pick out the caster in your group/guild that has the most downtime.. Have that caster put a few points into fletching and just start making arrows. The guild and/or the caster themselves can get their ingredients ( They do not cost that much for what they save...i.e. tank taking damage running mobs across to camp sites, constant healing from multiple accidental pulls etc etc) In larger raids and with the addition of KEI there is little to no downtime even on the larger raids but as long as your caster is making arrows then they are a seriously effective member of the group/guild. To avoid having only one skilled fletcher you can always pass the kit to the tank or anyone else who is interested. Not to mention and by far the most important is the happiness of your tank who instead of bashing casters for sitting (which they MUST do... hehe myself included) they get to see -->>Soulhavoc has succeeded in creating a class 8 steel tipped arrow&lt;&lt;--- Yay. For some it would seem that this skill notice would irritate the tank while hes killing/being killed... but trust me.. it bothers him a lot less then sitting casters talking about where he almost died last night. When in the rare instance we do have downtime I simply hand my kit to the main tank to practice his while we meditate. My fletching skill is now 195 , my tanks is at 150. By the way, at higher levels the arrows DO pay off, ex. when making silver tipped arrows with ceramic vanes.. and with a shadowhaven faction modifier (See the quest if you are not sure) my own decent charisma buff and a couple of Opal Encrusted Steins in my hands (Charisma 158) I can sell back these arrows for only 2 silver less then I paid for them... which means... less arrows in my inventory slot and more room for more ingredients for more.. yes.. skill.
