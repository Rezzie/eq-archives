This is on the EverquestLive.com page from the dev team:

You've been asking for them and now we're ready to discuss them. We're taking a big departure from what many of you are used to when it comes to combat. With that in mind, here is a brief summary of these exciting enhancements to better help you target your questions to us during the live chat. Don't worry if you miss the chat, we'll post the logs on EverQuestLive.com 

Increase the contributions melee classes provide in a group setting 
Address the current deficit between the pure melee classes and other classes 
Add more depth and potential for skilled play to melee combat 
Provide a system that encourages attentiveness and decision-making skills, without focusing heavily on twitch gameplay

Take advantage of an opponent's weakness. See an opening, strike home for the kill! 

Monks, Rogues and Warriors will gain the ability to recognize certain weaknesses in an opponent's defense. These "Openings" will be a variety of types and can occur based on several different situations during combat. Be quick though, an opening will not present itself for long. Strike quick with a new combat skill once your character recognizes an opening. These new combat skills are being designed just for this combat system revision. Using and maintaining these skills expends the character's Endurance (a new statistic, calculated from the character's basic stats). 

Increasing Your Endurance and Learning New Skills 


Increase Endurance by increasing attributes or by acquiring special items that directly increase your Endurance pool 
Find tomes or instructions manuals and take them to specific trainers to learn new skills 
Choose your skills from skill categories (such as Tactical) containing skills focused to a purpose 
Most openings are available only to a single character, but some are available to all nearby characters 
Disciplines will be transferred to this new system 
Existing Discipline timers will be reviewed, and several will probably be set to their own timer 
Disciplines will require an Endurance cost 
Hybrids will receive a limited Endurance pool for their disciplines
There will be other changes as well. Keep your eyes on the Test server and our update messages for more details as we move forward. 

This new system is much more flexible than the existing disciplines. It will be relatively easy to add new combat skills, as well as new skills that are not limited to openings. This system creates the possibility for tremendous enhancement in the future, allowing groups a large number of options when it comes to melee combat.

In my opinion the best way to read this board is to just click on most recent.  The board just isn't busy enough to warrant filtering.

I wouldn't say he was saying you're an idiot.  However, he was pointing out that a thread was already started on it.  Not that you not knowing it was there is really a big deal.  I think you're just blowing it a bit out of proportion.

DAoC, anyone?

Hey, Nosferatu, glad to see you're still here.  Debating returning to EQ...either restarting my monk or making yet another enchanter (a class I was always far better with, even pre-Kunark).

Hizuka...don't start the DAoC stuff.  Yes, it's similar to some of DAoC's stuff.  Yet, there were non-MMORPGs out long aog with similar tactics, which is <I>probably</i> where Mythic got it.

You might want to think about bringing back your monk...it seems these new changes will be doing some really cool things for monks.  Also, I read something about Monks mitigating some damage that was dealt to them from behind, making pulling a LOT less dangerous.

LDoN is great, though you'll find that monks have had pulling taken from them in this situation.  Pacify pulls are much safer and quicker than Monk splits - though combined together...monk pull a few, and clr/pal/ench pacify them as they walk back...is a great tactic.

Hehe Ok, I'll lay off the DAoC; that's just what popped to mind when I heard them talking about endurance.  :-)  That game had its own problems, anyway - I left it, too.

To be honest, I started the monk when I retured from my FIRST retirement, mainly because I had retired shortly after Kunark came out and sold my enchanter that fall.  Whoops.  At least the buyer was an acquaintance of mine.  Anyway, I truly enjoyed the class, and I was damned good at it, but shortly after SoV came out, I tried EQ again as an enchanter on a friend's account, got up to the mid-30's in a few weeks (hey, I was rusty!), and discovered the magic resist hell that is/was Velious.  So when I got my own new account, I decided to try the only other class that interested me, the monk.

It was fun, both the insane melee and the pulling.  (You'll always endear yourself to a monk with comments like 'I've never SEEN so much damange spam go by so fast'.)  I've good memories of both, honestly, although, as you said, some of the later pulling could get a bit painful.

My problem is the tedium - I grew amazingly tired of spending 6+ hours LFG as a monk, being told they'd rather have a 50 rogue or beastlord.  I wanted to fight; I wanted to perma-pull (even if some whiners complained I spent more time out bringing mobs to the group than standing there fighting in PoN).  I didn't want to sit on my tail all night long shouting for a group and hoping some desperate group took pity.  Add in the AC nerf from last year, and I had suddenly lost even most of my ability to solo, as my gear was a bit sub-standard, since I preferred to let people who needed the drops get them rather than getting them myself and selling them.  I don't mind soloing on occasion, but after 3 weeks of alternating soloing (slowly, as even LDC's did a lot of damage to scaled arse now) and fruitless evenings LFG, I got fed up and left.

(And I don't join guilds to get stuff; I join guids with people I want to be around, and mine had fallen apart previously.)

If I come back, all of the above will almost definitely lead me to going back to enchanting, even though the thought of practicing JC back up is...painful.  All because the changes sucked away any of the joy that was Hizuka.  He'll still be there for emergencies, but unless things have drastically changed, and by the talks about melee balancing, they haven't, then I'll probaby be going enchanter again.  We play to enjoy ourselves, after all.

Do what you will. :)

You mention solo'ing.  You already have experience with Enchanters, so you know they can - though it "ain't easy".

Ever try a necro?  They are amazingly adept at solo'ing (I know...duh!) but they, when you have intelligent people that know it, offer excellent support and DPS to a group.

Or, if you like Enchanters, did you ever think about bards?  Bards are the new kings of pulling in LDoN.  And, you get a similar feel from the mezzes/charms.  Though a bard is again, "ain't easy".

Anyway, you'll be back. :D - everyone who even thinks about posting the words, "Thinking of coming back", does.  It's like a 99.999% probability. :)

Oh, I've tried both necro and bard.  The necro bored me, since they're not amazingly group friendly and I prefer not to solo (I'm just not averse to it).  Bard?  Yeah, he was ok, but twisting just irritated the **** out of me (got the bard to 20 before giving up).

Enchanters aren't difficult to solo at all, you just need to find spaces with some maneuver room and multiple blues to fight at the same time - Oasis was great back in the day.  Pull 3-5 spectres, get xp from all but 1, and be happy.  With an enchanter, it's way way WAY harder to solo one mob than it is to solo a few simultaneously.

Yeah, I'll probably be back again, just read the Kerafyrm RZ stuff and got a bit geeked for them.

I have ZERO respect for the soloers who play EQ set to "easy" mode. You are just to lazy to group, and want easy exp/loot. Quad kiting mobs and emptying zones/spawns meant for groups. Yea, give him more ideas how to screw this game up worse than it is by broken over-powered chars. While these same broken over-powered chars make STUPID comments on how warrior isn't broken. Then they selfishly hog spawns or even entire zones. I have zero respect for you!

You have NO idea who I am or my history on these boards.  Hell, if you think I WANT to solo, then you apparently couldn't even be bothered to actually read what I wrote.  I solo when I have an hour or two to play, or when I cannot find a group (since the AC nerf, monks have had it very bad, too).  Was it too difficult to read the part about me spending 6 hours a night for WEEKS looking for a group?  How is that being too freaking lazy to find a group?

You obviously have NO clue how to play this game if you think enchanter soloing involves kiting a mob.  We won't even get into your not understanding why enchanters have to solo multiples at the same time.  Little clue for you, though - druids and wizards quad at high level because it's the only way to efficiently do it.  Enchanters do multiples because it's the only reasonable way to do it.  (My best, pre-Kunark, was accidentally pulling all 7 spectres in Oasis and having to put them all down, a) because there was no one else in the zone capable of killing them, and b) because if I zoned, they'd go kill the lowbies.)

For the record, though, if you really were an old fart warrior, you'd remember me and my support of the warrior class, through highs and lows.  Just because I don't enjoy playing them has never meant I didn't respect them.

What else can I expect from an anon troll, though, someone without enough guts to use their real name?  When you grow up and learn to play an enchanter and learn there's far, far more to it than mez and clarity, then you can speak.  Until then, leave the discussion to your betters.

Please...he's a) unregistered and b) a troll.  Wait, let me rephrase, an ignorant troll.  Just ignore him.  He has no idea what the hell he's talking about.

Yeah, sorry, was feeling a bit pugnacious last night.  Have a happy Turkey Day!
