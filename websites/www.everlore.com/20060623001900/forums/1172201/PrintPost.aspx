I'm a newbie.  I've been playing EQ for almost a week.  I really need pointers or any items that would help me out if anyone would be so kind as to help me out.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanx.

It would help if you told us what class you are playing.

Allright, here we go :)

1.) Always shout out a PC(Price check) on all of the items you buy/sell. It will save you from being cheated out of a deal :)

2.) Don't Train. Training is where you get a lot of monsters attacking you and you get rid of them by having them attack someone else.

3.) Be courteous. I can't stress this enough. 

4.)I would advise you to start one of the "Melee" classes or a "Hybrid" as your first character. Starting out with one of the "Pure spellcasters" or "Priest Class" char.'s can be tough as a newbie.

5.) Learn the lingo. SBS stands for Shiny Brass Shield. This will be very handy when you are trying to sell/buy items :)

6.)Use the right chat channels! Use /auction for selling/buying, /shout for warning about trains or other emergency like stuff, and /ooc as a general chat channel to talk about anything. People get, um..., upset when noobs use them wrong ;)

7.) Don't beg. If you ever want any help from someone only ask for buffs, and if you do so, make sure you thank them. Also, if someone offers you sometin, don't hesitate to take it, LOL. Like I really needed to explain that one :P

8.) Have fun. Don't get too serious with EQ. It's just a game, make sure you do somethin else with your time. 


Hope this helps :)

I am sedentary by nature, enjoying passive entertainment, eating when the mood takes me, and playing with my food. I try to avoid conflict, but when I'm angered, I can be a devil - if you force me to fight, I will crush you. With apples. <A HREF="http://blog.ravenblack.net/quiz/videogame.pl">What Video Game Character Are You?</A></TD></TR></TABLE>
