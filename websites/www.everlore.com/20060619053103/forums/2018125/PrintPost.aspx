I would love to see a classic server with none of the expansions.  Of course not many would want to play it, but I guess I just miss the old days of playing EQ when the game was fun and a little more simple.  When getting a full set of banded was a huge goal for everyone.  Where traveling from Freeport to Qeynos was a huge journey few had taken.  When Blackburrow was full and everyone begged for sows and mino axes were all the rage.  I truly miss those times, but I guess you can never go back.  Maybe a classic version for gameboy? =P

I have now noticed from reading other posts that Im not alone.  Sorry if this seems like it's been posted over and over.  I have not played the game in over a year now and have recently just logged on because I miss some of the aspects of the game (running around Qeynos and stuff).  I had quit shortly after SOL because something about the game lost its appeal.  It became too chaotic and confusing and it was like logging on to a totally different game.  My mistake which really wasnt my fault was not finding a guild that became a powerguild which ultimately kept me from good items and spots in fun to go to raids.  I ultimately became a helper and took joy in helping lower levels (most of them are higher than me and have no time to stop to say hi) or just starting a new character to play. It's sad to see now all the zones I loved so much growing up in spending countless hours in are all now completely dead.  I'm a level 56 shaman and I totally feel like a newbie and getting up to 60 seems hard enough, now I need to get up to 65 and find massive sums of money for spells and items (500,000pp items? 1000pp seems like a lot to me) just so I can enjoy the game better with others?  Id rather dedicate more time to my personal life for huge gains.  I spend most of my time at the Ice Giant area.  Thank goodness for LDON though so I don't completely feel alone in that zone.

My idea for the classic server is newly dropped items, same zones with different spawns and rare spawns.  More combinable items, better trade items combined with rare drops and tougher quests, one time quests, and rare specialized abilities an average leveler could obtain to become highly desireable in guilds. Better announcements on GM events like posters on city walls. Why leave out the nonpowergamer in on the fun?  It shouldnt be all "smash and grab look at me I have all the best items in the game".  What special abilty could I gain that those people would look at a player like me and awe?  Rather than dumping more and more expansions, why not make the game better on one server with one expansion and give everyone there some fun?  My best days were level 1-25.  After that it became a rat race with only a top goal of "look at me".

I'm glad to see people saying what I have been wishing for for months. I truly miss the old game.&nbsp; I would deffinitely start playing again if they put up an old school server.

<P>I've been playing EQ since June 2000.&nbsp; I, too would prefer a classic game where everyone is on equal terms facing the same challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm tired of obtaining keys to advance.&nbsp; I did my Vex Thal key only to head there 6 times.&nbsp; I am flagged for Time and raided in that zone longer, but not enough to merit the year long goals of becoming flagged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I don't have time to put together my Anguish Key and frankly, I'm burned out on the whole flagging / keying part of EQ.&nbsp; I'm flagged / keyed for zones no one groups in.&nbsp; No one groups on the planes anymore, no one really wants to.&nbsp; And why is that?&nbsp; Loot?&nbsp; Exp?&nbsp; Boredom?&nbsp; Heck, I was in Plane of Torment for 2 weeks, gathering baking supplies.&nbsp; I was the only one there, well, except for the odd player running deeper into the zone.</P>
<P>Raid zones take hours.&nbsp; Gaining flags, keys, or even runes more time.&nbsp; The game isn't about a casual player anymore.&nbsp; If you want to keep up or remain in a raiding type guild, you have to commit to long hours.&nbsp; And I am a casual player.&nbsp; As the age base of the game is growing older, their lives change, and I bet most don't have the time for EQ as they used to.&nbsp; Of course there's always the die hard fan but I've seen more and more become casual players before finally leaving the game.</P>
<P>The game was about&nbsp;casual groupings&nbsp;of players learning a zone and learning their character to where it is now.&nbsp; Waiting on groups.&nbsp; Waiting for the right players for those groups.&nbsp; Taking up to half an hour to get to the group spot.&nbsp; Not being able to group.&nbsp; </P>
<P>Lower to mid level characters have difficulty finding players to group.&nbsp; High levels are in the same situation but theirs is by choice.&nbsp; Either they are tired of the same exp spots, they are too picky of classes in the group, they're still banned from a mission and they'd rather do that mission than anything else, or they're more interested in loot and would rather group where the loot is prime.&nbsp; Or in my case it's being burned out by long nightly raids and not wanting to spend time grouping.&nbsp; Lately I've just been logging in to raid.&nbsp; If I log in.</P>
<P>General impression here, but I feel that the upper levels aren't grouping for fun.&nbsp; It's about what they want out of the game, more self interest and goals.&nbsp; It's about gear, AA's, levels, achievements, keys, flags, and what not and it's doing all those in the most efficient manner possible.</P>
<P>I had more fun starting a newbie in the tutorial this week than I've had for a month playing my level 70 cleric.&nbsp; I have plenty of content.&nbsp; I don't want any more expansions.&nbsp; I would like to see more quality in the exsisting content.</P>

I just recently started playing EQ again after 2 years and I am shocked to see what has happened.&nbsp; This isn't the same game I had played a couple years ago.&nbsp; After being on for only 2 months I am already longing for all of the things I remember that made the game so great to play.&nbsp; No more overcrowded EC tunnel with /auction making it impossible to carry on a conversation, or the occasional /shout SLATE TO TUNNEL!!!.&nbsp; Armor prices were all PP per AC and bronze armor was uber at lv 15.&nbsp; No more boats to sit on for 30 minutes just trying to get from FP to BB.&nbsp; I made 90% of my old EQ friends sitting on boats passing time. &nbsp;The game just isn't the same and if there is anyway to bring the real EQ back please let me know how and when and I'll be there in a heartbeat.

Velious, Kunark, and Luclin are better than any other SOE expansion
combined. Its in the back of all of our minds, SOE killed Everquest.
Verant was awesome. Yes the game was difficult, some things were
tedious to the point of downright frustration, but the first 3 were
incredible pieces to the game. When Velious came out, Temple of Veeshan
was THE place to work toward Then Luclin came out. Oh god was Ssra the
baddest thing ever? Vex thal? I remember finding Netherbian Lair for
the first time, and i thought it was awesome. What happened to Lammys
being uber? What happened to "hey lets camp Lodi"? When it was HARD to
get on the lift to Gfay cuz it was so damn crowded, not to mention
crushbone. AoW was considered near impossible. Here comes PoP. This
expansion was good to say the most. Great xp, good game expansion. Then
came the other 23407230987 expansions that released weapons and armor
that were so ridiculously powerful it tilted the game completely to one
side. Nothing is difficult anymore, theyve tailored the game to baby
newbies, and the new interface sucks. I miss the classicness.<br>

I would LOVE if Verant, or whoever is in charge of the game now, would
set up original EQ I servers with no expansions and start everyone off
at the same level.&nbsp; This would be the best thing they could do to
keep Everquest alive.&nbsp; All of my best memories from playing
Everquest came from the beginning when everyone was in the same
boat.&nbsp; Starting out now you have to compete with level 50's and
60's and there are no newbs to help you out or group with.<br>
<br>
Seriously, someone in the know, forward our wishes on and maybe if they
generate enough feedback we can have EQ again the way it used to be =).<br>

Ah, good news.&nbsp; I just checked sony's everquest forums and they
ARE planning a progressive server.&nbsp; Starting from the classic and
adding on the expansions after a period of time.<br>
<br>
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board?board.id=Progression<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all there when it comes out =) <br>

<P>Actually, unlocking expansions will probably not be time based but event based such as, killing Vox, Naggy, CT and Inny.&nbsp; Apparently, just like the FV roleplay preferred server, there are several 'uber' guilds lining up to run through content, unlocking expansions as rapidly as possible.&nbsp; Personally, I hope they find doing so much more difficult than they think it will be.&nbsp; Regardless, I don't think this server will be very much different from most other servers within a year to 18 months.&nbsp; Still, I'll try it out for a while.</P>
