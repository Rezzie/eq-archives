<P>I've included the old Dark Army charter for anyone who played EQ on the Rallos Zek server shortly after the game came out.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you could kill&nbsp;another player&nbsp;who was within four levels&nbsp;and take all of their coin and one item, the PvP was a free for all.&nbsp; Guilds hunting other guilds and individual PvPs hunting down anyone in striking range.</P>
<P>A great time for PvP, and at the height, I established the Dark Army to organize PvP wizards into a cohesive strike force.&nbsp;Of course this will be lost on most who never played back then, ridiculed by the few that did and were ganked by the Dark Army's kill squads, and a good read for those that we fought against or along side.</P>
<P>I dug this out of the archives for anyone who remembers the old EQ days on Rallos when PvP was fun.</P>
<P>Enjoy,</P>

<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>"Hail Dark Army, </SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN>We are in need of members who can agree to show up one day a week for guild hunt nights in a certain zone that we are controlling.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Currently the guild hunt nights are Monday, from </SPAN><SPAN>8pm</SPAN><SPAN> to </SPAN><SPAN>12am EST.</SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp; Our strength comes from being a team. We have a blast attacking other guilds and players, but without unity any guild is destined to fail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I guarantee you'll enjoy the experience!&nbsp; I've included our charter so you can understand what the Dark Army stands for.&nbsp; We must be unified in our ways if we are to succeed in our goals. </SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR></SPAN><B><U><SPAN>DARK ARMY CHARTER:</SPAN></U></B><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN>Our goal is to build the largest standing army of player killing wizards on the server.&nbsp; But not an army of weak, second-rate PKers, we want experienced killers working with us.&nbsp; The only way to get this experience is to get out and battle with other players and guilds.&nbsp; Only by fighting other players will we grow in strength and learn the skills needed to destroy our enemies.&nbsp; The following are the goals and obligations we must observe to obtain our destined greatness. </SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR></SPAN><B><U><SPAN>Level 12 WIZARDS ONLY guild:</SPAN></U></B><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR>The goal is to build a circle of 12 wizards that will be the center of the Dark Army.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>That’s one officer and two other wizards per attack squad.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN>All Wizards need to reach level 12 and stop at that point.&nbsp; When we are all the same level we can attack the same targets; this way our numbers count for more.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>We can take out buffed or twinked enemies that are four levels higher when we attack as one force. In addition, anyone that attacks any of our members can be attacked by all of us.&nbsp; We are the wolf pack that takes down the lion.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>When we have twelve wizards working together we will own anyone we meet regardless of buffs, level or healers.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>That day is coming, but until then we must work as a team to maximize our power.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR></SPAN><B><U><SPAN>Battle</SPAN></U></B><B><U><SPAN> Conduct:</SPAN></U></B><SPAN> </SPAN><SPAN><BR><BR></SPAN><SPAN>During guild events all members are required to show their guild tags.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The ranking officer at the hunt will use their hotkeys to declare who the next target to kill is.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>All members need to create a hotkey to show that they are targeting the same victim.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The standard hotkey is something like: ”Preparing to fire on %t” (Percent ‘T’ will say the name of the victim that has been targeted.)<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><SPAN>Fire upon the target until he is killed or an order to fall back has been given. </SPAN><U><SPAN><BR><BR><o:p></o:p></SPAN></U></P>

We don't care how you do it or whether it is legal or not.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Anyone that crosses our path is subject to immediate attack.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
