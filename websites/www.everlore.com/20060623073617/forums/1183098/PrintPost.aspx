This is a little post to Sharvaysta.
I've been reading these forums for a good 2-3 months now ( restarted my EQ account after doing 9 months military training ),  and almost every post having to do with anything that MIGHT be controversial (sp?) or sexist or in any AMERICAN ( that whole freedom of speech thing ) ,  YOU have put in yer two sense about how WRONG it is, then killed the Topic.  You have done this on atleast 5 posts that I have read in the past hour ( waiting for patch of course ). 
So, to get to the point,  COULD YOU PLEASE QUIT YER BITCHING ?  WE really don't care ! We might argue back with you like we care about what you have to say, but alas, its only in hopes to shut you up, or even try to teach you the blindness of your retaliations.

Note: please excuse run-on sentances and CAPS
P.S. I do realize the whole hypocritical part about Free Speech

TO SUMMARIZE:
- Shut up, we don't care
- Keep Replies on Subject
- Women are not the dominate sex in the human race, live with it, if you can't, pretend to be a... black widow spider..
- People who make a big deal about nothing cause the world to suck ( that guy who wants "under god" out of the pledge for example, your no better than him )
- EQ is addictive, it is a game, but in the future ALL games will be like EQ, all MMORPG's and the like


RELATED SUBJECT: EQ 2  means no char transfers, what will happen then ? EQ 1 loyalists staying forever ? or a mass cleansing that is needed when everyone moves to EQ 2 ???    I can't wait till that release !!! heehhe

Hey Krazy,

  Since this is a public board, and since Sharvausta hasn't broken any forum rules, she has done nothing wrong.

  You may not like the posts ... tough luck.  Just as Sharvausta has the privilage to post a opinion, so do you, but no one is forcing you or anyone else to read it.
 
  Just as you are annoyed at Sharvausta's posts, I am annoyed at your post attacking her.  Luckily, Elore allows such posts within reason.

"Keep replies on subject"-TheKrazyOne

Shar does keep her replies on subject.  Just because you don't agree with her replies or can't understand them doesn't mean she's hijacking the threads.  I've never seen her comments go off-topic (unlike some of mine).

"Women are not the dominate sex in the human race, live with it, if you can't, pretend to be a... black widow spider.."-TheKrazyOne

Where the fuck did that come from?  She's never put up an "anti-man" post that I've ever seen.  The only thing that came close was her poking fun at the guys for drooling over a bunch of pixels.  Hit a little too close to home for ya, did it?  FYI, there is no such thing as a "dominate" sex.  The word you're looking for is "dominant", and frankly, there's not really a dominant sex, either...there's only idiots that think they're superior due to gender (that goes for both men and women, btw).

 "People who make a big deal about nothing cause the world to suck ( that guy who wants "under god" out of the pledge for example, your no better than him )"-TheKrazyOne

Oh yeah?  And likewise, people that don't give a shit are the kind that let the world go to hell.  Sounds like you need to pull your head out of your ass and step into the twenty-first century with the rest of us.  Not everyone is Christian, and like it or not, women can vote.  I think you're still stuck back in the puritan days.
