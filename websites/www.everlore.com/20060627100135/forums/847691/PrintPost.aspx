Ive obtained level 55 and i am now welcome along on every raid the guild offers. My delema is... There are at any time around 5 shamans along with us in a given raid. Im running out of stuff to do.. I buff my group then just watch haste the whole fight. They do not like me sending pet it because it could gather argo and they do not want me to stack dots? So is all im going to be doing in raids hasting , seems silly to me my dots do so much dmg why not add them on? about slow.. they is a "main slower" a level 65 sham im assuming he has the highest slow % or something..

There's no reason why you shouldn't stack your DoTs.  Depending on the area/mob you are raiding, there's no reason you shouldn't have your pet (remember, it does depend greatly on the mob/area).

You should also know how to /assist heal.  If you do not, ask a cleric to teach you.  It's easy.

Haste is very important...don't take that as a punishment.  The overall DPS of the raid drops conciderably if haste is down too long.

I understand why it's frustrating sometimes.

esp when there's a chanter for haste and tash, 2 or more MGB shaman with SCRM & IEE4 doing all the buffing, plenty of druids and clerics,  a mage doing malosomething.

at 65, you can just ferine avatar a melee class every minute I guess.

I've been there and it does get pretty boring. Oh.. and if the raid mob isn't slowable. heh

Other than that, shaman are a blast to play.

If your MT is in any danger of losing aggro to your pet, your guild has bigger problems than you adding dots.

/agree Moshank

It's true also that each fight is different and there may be times when a pet or DoTs aren't tactically sound. But honestly, I can't think of any.

The only reason I can think to not stack DoTs would be on mobs that you want mezzed or mobs that you want to keep at a certain health level (Rathe Council event, but at 56, I do not believe you will be seeing that soon).

Otherwise, as long as you are assisting the MT on a mob that the guild means to kill, DoT stacking should be fine... it's damage after all. But don't piss off your officers, don't want you booted from your guild just cause we said DoT stacking was alright. Use your best judgement and communicate with your raid officers.

Being the 5th or 6th Shaman on a raid can definately be boring, especially at your level. For me however, it was the event itself and the comraderie with guild mates that I enjoyed most. I would fit in wherever I could on the raid, Buffing (especially those recently rezzed), healing, debuffing (slow, cripple, disease, maloxxx) and if my support role was being handled just fine, I would even melee and work on a weapon skill (still want that max hand to hand.. /snicker).

I hope you can find your nitch in the raiding schema of your guild... 

Be safe and hunt well friend

Um, folks, you can't lose aggro to a pet...it's impossible.  They are treated as NPCs to the MOB.  ONLY, and ONLY if they are the closest object on the MOB's hate list will a mob target a pet.  The moment a PC moves in distance, and is on it's hate list, that PC will take aggro.

I think a few of you are missing the role of a Shaman in raids. The role of the shaman can depend on where you are raiding however.

When we raid we need shamas for MANY MANY critical roles.

1. A shaman is usually designated as buffer for the raid.(will rebuff when people are rez'd)
2. Many times shaman's act as group healers.
3. Several Shaman's are usually designated Malos duty and others slow duty. We usually have 5-6 shaman's per raid and they are always busy and none of us have time for casting dots or nessing with pets.

Shaman's are a very very very critical class for raids. So, if you are sitting around bored your raid isn't moving fast enough and many other people will be bored or you need to re-evaluate what you are doing on the raid.

/pet taunt &lt;---turns pet taunt off if they are worried about getting aggro (which really should never be a problem)

<p>Work on getting those levels! 

<p>You can get the DoT 'Anthema' from BB adventures for 410 pts, It does quite a bit of damage and only lasts for 30 seconds (and it is great to have for undead when your poison/disease DoT's won't land)

<p>You also have a couple of DD's, use them once the mob is down to 40% health or so

<p>If all this fails to make being a shaman fun, spend some quality time shrinking the barbarians, trolls and ogres, and growing the dwarves, gnomes and halflings :p

Jobeker...

I don't think I'm missing the role of a raid Shaman at all...

*** You wrote:
1. A shaman is usually designated as buffer for the raid.(will rebuff when people are rez'd
***

First, people have to die for this person to do their job. In the early stages of the fight, when no one is needing rez buffs, why not throw a DoT or two on the target mob?

*** You wrote:
2. Many times shaman's act as group healers.
***

This is of course, assuming no Cleric, Druid or Paladin in group. But you are correct, in some situations, a Shaman needs to focus on group members health. There may also be situations where, for a Shaman in this role, his group members aren't taking much damage. In this case, why couldn't he slap a DoT or two on the target mob?

*** You wrote:
3. Several Shaman's are usually designated Malos duty and others slow duty. 
***

In most raiding situations, this will be the most important role for a Shaman. However, Once Malo'd and Slow'd (maybe even Crippled)... there is a seven minute window before Turgur's needs to be re-applied. Why couldn't a Shaman throw a DoT or two on the target mob while they're waiting?

Just remember, it's ALL about the scenario. There are many factors that will determine how busy a Shaman will be during a raid. Use your best judgement, if the role that has been given to you for a particular raid allows you the chance to add DoT damage to the kill... by all means, do that.

Let me give an example... and qualify this bay saying that my guild is not Elemental, we are just now getting into the meat of Vex Thal, although we do take out the PoP targets of opportunity (like VZ last night). So we are not Ele/Time uber, but we are far from weak. Anyway, last night my guild did the Emp in Ssra... We had five Shaman on the raid... One Shaman was designated solely to the CC group, maintaining Turgur's on the four slowable, but unmezzable mobs. Another Shaman was responsible for landing Malos and Malicious Decay on the Emp (refreshing every few minutes if they wanted), once debuffed, this Shaman could pretty much do as they pleased. Another Shaman was responsible for maintaining Disease slow (Grummus) on the Emp, inbetween which he could do as he pleased. Another Shaman was the rez buffer, responsible for getting those rezzed buffed and back on their feet ASAP (FYI - Only three people died during the whole fight). Another Shaman had no direct role, except to fill in where needed. 

This being the scenario... I was the rez buffer... during the fight, I maintained FA on a five melee list, I maintained Breath of Ultor, Pox of Bert and Plague on the Emp the entire fight. And I was still able to perform my role well, only three died and were buffed within seconds of popping into zone. And, even with all this going on, there were moments where I had nothing to do, brief though they were.

So use your best judgement... your role on the raid is your priority and responsibility. If you are not jeopardizing your role, add Damage on the target mob (DoT, DD, Spirit Call, Puppy (assuming he is permitted)).

Fynris, I don't think you're missing the role of the Shaman in a raid. I just didn't want to specifically name anyone. I agree with most everything you say above. 

I am in an EP capable guild(almost time) but I don't think that matters here. However, we do move very quickly and efficiently through our raids which keeps our Shamans very busy all the time. That is clearly one difference. However, a poster above mentions casting DoTs because their are to many shamans and they get bored. Well their is nothing wrong with two shamans casting slow on the same target if you start to get bored. If someone is on Malos you go on Malosinia to even reduce resists further. Their is always something to do and debuffing we do best.

I hope I didn't come across as suggesting that you didn't know the role of a Shaman either, pardon me if it did.

I hope that perhaps, the comments made here, might help the original poster and others get a clearer picture of the Shaman role during raid. I believe, and I think you do to, that there is always something for a Shaman to do during a raid. Knowing our class and it's capabilities will aid a Shaman keep bust during raids.

How far til Time?

I'ma new recruit with Hooac, still on Trial status, but I'm five events shy of Time myself. Kinda funny, I was a recruit for Coirnav and Xegony, but still don't have Behemoth, Bert or MM.

No, you didn't.

I still need Fennin RO which I am having difficulty getting because a particular Euro guild has been killing him every Cycle so our guild can't hit Time.

Actually you should also slow dont wory about the lead slower but remember there will be times he wont land slow on the first try also so who knows maybe yours will land so alway always try to slow to and then dot once cause two or more can actually get agro on you and you really dont want that then mainly keep others buffed and watch for deaths to rebuff them as soon as they are rezzed and then really help and believe me you will be great great help as patching heals to all you can . Hope this helps I have lvl 65 shaman all flagged all the way to Time and elemental and Kod Taz also and patching as you gain levels will be a big big requirement.
             Be safe and good luck brother shaman!
