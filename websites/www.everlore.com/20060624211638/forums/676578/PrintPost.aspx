As a druid, is a mount helpfull for any reasons beside the fact of sitless med, i ask because moneys tight, usually i think of a mounts purpose as being a way to draw less argo when casting but druids dont really have that problem when played right unless chealing i suppose.. big nukes maybe but is it worth it for the money, rather broke at the moment.

Druids not drawing aggro?  I know for a fact in Jaggedpine, that when a Pomenaide comes out of the water, the Druids' first to get attacked.  Why?  No clue.  But eliminating the sit down aggro is a defiante plus for the mount.

You really have to prioritize. What kind of player are you? Group or solo? What zones do you visit most often? Inside zones, where the only luxury of owning a drum (I'm partial to drogmirs) is to fill up the Ammo slot; or, do you visit primarily outdoor zones? (IE, PoP vs LDoN). 

If you group, how do you group? Druids who do group can easily obtain aggro at some points, even when being careful. Often, when I group or raid I'm with another, higher level druid. Rather than trying to do what that druid does, I typically assume the role of debuffing. I've learned how to control aggro, however, if I sit--even as far away as is safe--I'll often obtain aggro of the mob (or worse, get summoned..eww). However, most of the zones I fight in are indoor zones, so a horse still won't do any good. I just have to be careful with my mana. But, if I did play in outdoor zones, I probably would be more inclined to invest in a horse. With the release of LDoN, and my overwhelming preference of it, I doubt my choice in zone types will change much though. Bottom line is, if you value your meditate skill, and group in outdoor zones, buying a horse seems very worthwhile. If you solo, horses are really too slow to have an extreme value, unless you root/dot, but that isn't the most efficient way for us to use our solo ing skills anyway. 

Instead, I offer you this. If you solo or group primarily indoors, invest your time and money into items that save you mana. You could get a focus item, mana regen spells druid get in their later levels, items with Flowing Thought, or items with significant clicky effects (such as the ES BP w/chloro, or velious armor MQs). If you group outdoors, such as most planes, go for the horse. It probably would be more valuable. 

Or, if you just want to get a horse because they're cool, then spend the stupid 10k. It's only money after all, and if a horse would make you happy, then go for it. That's the whole point of the game anyway.

Like said before, depends on your play style. But if it is possible pp wise then get a mount. When I can use it, i will use it. It is reduces aggro, you keep medding even during casts, in all a big help I have found.

And although 10kp may sound like a lot at the moment, it isn't that much.. just go hunting in JPF for some time. anaconda meat 50pp a piece, Griffon meat 30pp a piece, plantshoot (foraged) 30pp a piece. Then with luck the griffons eye, 1Kp..

On good day I make 3Kp there easy.. (playing for just a few hours..)

Hmmm...

All I can say is from spending a lot of time in the bazaar, and a LOT of time in Jagged Pine....

you won't find THAT kind of money there, in JP. 

The Griffon that drops the Griffon's eye is INCREDIBLY rare. Did i say INCREDIBLY? lol. Let me reiterate that----I've killed literally hundreds (maybe thousands) of griffons and griffenes in that zone...and I've gotten 1 eye of griffon to drop. And, that was after reading every little peice of info on it, and chain nuking to kill the griffon when a group was just around the corner to get it (it really does glow, and spawns near the poachers---and no, i didn't ks it, the other group didn't see it, and I didn't want them too lol Glowing griffons=the whole of that group chain nuking hehe). 

The most I've seen anaconda meet or griffon meet sell for in the bazaar is 1p. Yes. 1p. A lot more than what they'll sell for to a merchant, but not worth it IMHO. What I've done is keep all my stacks of both those meets because its pretty much the only feasible way I can find to bring my baking to 250 w/out spending big buckets of money I don't have. 

However, this isn't to say JP is a bad zone to get some dough and exp in. Quite the contrary, its a good zone. It isn't HG kind of money, but what really is? What you have to do is root/dot the willowhisps in that zone. They're good exp, easy kills, and drop at least 10p every time. They usually drop like 3-5 platinum, and drop a Greater light stone everytime (or better, but the better stones, which have some blind spell thingy w/1 charge, or maybe its a stun, isn't really as good to sell). Don't sell these to merchants. There's 2 different quests that use these, 1 for good people and 1 for bad. If you're of a good race, go to the NK gypsy camp. There's a female gypsy that wants them, and gives you a book in return. W/max cha, that book sells for around 10p. Which means on top of the 3-5pp and occasional gem, you get 100p for every 10 kills (which are easy, and good exp at around lvl 45-52ish). 

Even better for platinum tho & exp, I suggest quadding Rockhoppers for their superb and flawless hides in either scarlet desert or DSP. DSP is busy, and they're not always up. I'm not sure about the scarlet desert ones, I just know they're there and that a guildie used to quad them there instead because it isn't so busy...but I know its a bit more dangerous tho. 

Also, quadding wveryns late at night (when CS isn't busy) can be pretty decent exp/loot too. 


All of these places tho are real good zones, in which 1k pp will come faster than you'd realize...and you just need to duplicate that hehe. GL if you so choose to get a horse.

I play a necro. I agro kite <b>ALOT</b> as Im sure most druids do as well. A mount is about the single most worthless item in the game for agro kiteing. Its slow, unresponsive and reduces agro.  

If you dont agro kite, start. If you do, a mount is a waist of money.

lol after playing the bazaar pretty smart and making some cash from various means, I bought a horse (= Just a cheapy. 

I just got one because I really wanted one, not for its practicality or non practicality. Its speed I'd say is about what I walk at; I have run 2 tho, so it isn't exactly slow. I doubt it'd be fast enough to quad effectively with, but I'm certain I could kite Elysians in UP with it...which is well worth it cuz I have JUST enough mana w/a kei to kill those things if I don't get adds. Even knowing how to pull them tho, I often will get a second aggro when I pull...and that's a dangerous thing. (lag=DEATH, so don't do it unless you're system runs well and fast). 

Anyway, I plan on using the horse just walking around. I have zero site problems, and I've even been able to melee fine with it (no teasing that i'm a melee'ing druid in my mid 50s!). I only really plan on using the horse in UP and if I group in the planes...which have been fairly empty since LDoN came out /sigh. 

It's uses are minimal, but I just really wanted a horse (= and when I can use it, 100% med time is better than any FT item I could ever get my hands on.

Mounts for druids are really just medding machines.  The drogmars are even better than the horses because you have no big horses head in the way when you cast.  In a group situation, being able to med on your mount and still cast is invaluable.  Other than that, save your money.
