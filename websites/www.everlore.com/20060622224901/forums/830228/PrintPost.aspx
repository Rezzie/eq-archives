There have got be some good reasons to be a troll sk.  I have seen alot of slams on the boards against being a troll sk.  I was trying to do some research and was hoping to see some positive posts on trolls...alas it seems troll sk's arent speaking up much.  Could I get some positive advice on trolls as sk's?  I like the regen and the look of trolls.  The starting stats seem to do well for me.  Well, mostly wanted to give atleast somewhat of a positive point for those considering trolls as sk's.

Why not?  Play what you like.

Ok, so the trolls got kicked out of their swamp by a bunch of hoppers and had to move in with the dark elves who don't particularly like them.  It happens.

They did pick up some newbie quests along the way.  Nektulos isn't so bad.  Lavastorm isn't either, and is typically a wide-open zone for a youngish troll to explore.

With books now, faction and newbie zones are largely a problem of the past.  You can hunt anywhere until your packs are full, book up to PoK, sell off, and book back down.

No light at the end of the tunnel, Trolls are as good in the early game as they are at the end.  You see no huge gains later like the small races do with 2hb AA or the bigger HP additions.  

Trolls are a solid Race, we have a 61 Troll SK in my Guild who just Tanked Executioner Trial.  The fact that he survived and won surprised many.  At that point he's a very solid tank, and even though I think he looses DPS to more intelligent Races do to their higher mana pool, he's no slouch.

The regen at higher levels is really a non issue.  Unless you constantly go in Skell form (which negates all your Large Race bonuses) the HP replacement just isn't enough to make a big difference once you have 4k HP's

The one piece of advice I'd add is to make sure you keep at least 1 1 hand weapon skill maxed.  A sword and shield is a HUGE help along the way for extra tanking power and resist gear as needed.
