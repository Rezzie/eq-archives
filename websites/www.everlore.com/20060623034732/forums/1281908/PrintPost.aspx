Ok...so far we have the extremes of PvP...Sullon is harcoded, teams rule all, and being mean as sh!t is part of the moral code...i like it =). Then you have Rallos where it is everyone for themselves and some people will kill you after they group with you and realize they are stronger than you...also fun.
Then tallon...alot of whiny babies with uber gear bragging that they deleveled from 51 to 35(everyone knows who that is lol) vs. people who want to play true pvp team and have no chance against a 4 team guild...so it is basically guildwar between the 4 team guilds. Haven't play on Vallon so i can't give my opinion...sorry.
Why not make a server with a mix and match of all the rules.  Not exactly hardcoded...but it has an exp bonus if you are only grouped with your own team. Bring back the rule where you can pk at lvl one cause that was cool(i got killed by alot of lvl 9 druids when i harmtouched them for 11) and the old con system they had way back then (where people could con blue and yellow like a mob would)....or something similar. And make newbie armour quests a little easier cause new servers are always flooded with people who get the rare items people need...then they quit the server when they realize they suck at PvP. And use the Race teams (preferably cause it sux to have to go con everone before inviting them to group on sullon) or the Diety teams(keep agnostic for chanters though....greatly helps out faction and increases the number of chanters on a server..just make agnostic on the nuet team) with the 8 lvl pk limit that is on Tallon and Vallon. 
It's sorta in the middle....if anyone has an i dea or a change they think would help the server add it(not that they will likely make this server any time soon if at all) but hey...it could happen(yeah right....and verant can bring back the moss covered twig)
Just my 2 copper....than a few more plat =)

I like the idea...and i like the con system described on wish list page,
  "Friend had idea for con where your lvl, and the    lvls above and below it cones black....4 lvls below that are blue and the 4 above conning black are yelow...then above yellow is orange and below blue is light blue....out of range is green if it is too low and a red if it is too high....this is just for pk though...mobs still would con the same. 
if you were 14 like this,then 5 and under would be green,6 7 and 8 would be light blue, 9-12 would be blue 13 14 and 15 would con black, 16-19 would be yellow, 20-22 would be orange, and 23 and up (out of range) is red."
It sounds cool...i don't like the new con system cause it's annoying when someone 8 lvl's below you attacks you and dishes out a great deal of 10 hp to take off of your 600....almost makes you feel bad for them...then you think "nah i got a cool screenshot of him dead =)" and the old one sucked cause you would hit a greenie with a spell to find out they weren't in range and that you wasted mana(but the old one was beter than the new in my opinion)
I like it.

I think that the con system would be better if it was all yellow for above you in range and red for out of range above youe...all blue for below you in range and green for below you in range....that way you never are sure if you are going to win or not....adds some suspense to it.
just my opinion though.

any difference in the con takes out the suspense. They had it before and they found out that allowing characters to see by way of con another level allowed too much ganking based on Ooo I can definitly beat him!... If you really want a challenge in the higher levels vs lower levels stuff.. go to Sullon .. any level can attack any level there.. WOnt cost you anything but time either cause they cant loot. Well PP but who really goes around with PP on them?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i have an idea for a pvp server also

its ROLEPLAYING
4 lvl range
everyone for them selves
you can loot in bags
necros can fear/chanters can charm(for roleplaying purposes... i mean necros strike fear into the hearts of everyone... and chanters are very charming...)
language barrier
ROLEPLAY MODE ONLY(like firiona vie was a few months ago)
And i also think that rangers should be THE masters of the bows... i mean warriors are just about equal to us in archery(excluding the occasional critical hit) rangers should have a MAJOR bow bonus dmg/dly wise and quivers should be able to be worn on the backslot)

and i think the language barrier shouldnt be so easy to raise cause on firiona vie.... you sit at a zoneline with someone that can teach you a language.. it clicks up.. you zone... do it again... zone... do it again... etc etc etc
i think it should be it can click up every 15 minutes 
and i mean that it doesnt refresh so you can zone and make it click raise it...(btw i think this way of raising skill should be an exploit)

and when you hail an NPC... say a gnome... and your a wood elf... you shouldnt be able to understand the gnome NPC... just like Gnolls when they shout at you about ruining thier land... shouldnt be able to understand them till you learn their language...

ill post some more on this later.. .my fingers are tired from typing this...
