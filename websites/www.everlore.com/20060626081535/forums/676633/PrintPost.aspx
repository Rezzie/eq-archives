Jaggedpine.  Which is not safe zone to wander around in if you are less than 50 or so, but you can forage the shoots anywhere in the zone.

While you are there, you might check the vendors for plantshoots, grif meat, and ananconda meat.  All sell well. 

Plant shoots are used both for cooking and for tailoring now.

I disagree that you need to be 50 for Jaggedpine.  I began soloing Griffawns at 41.  Yes, I would agree that you don't want to venture too far out, but you can go there sooner.

I didn't know that stuff sold for 30 pp.  Wonder if I kept mine or sold it to a vendor.  Hmmm....

Jaggedpine is the place to go young druid. you don't have to be 50+ but at lower lvls stay close to vendors and when they get attacked gate out. )

Those female mobs in the stream drop the shoots at a pretty decent rate as well.

As others have said, and I'll agree, Jaggedpine is the place to get these.  This zone is ideal for Druids needing to increase their bank account in a fast way.  Not only with the foraging of Plant shoots, butr also with the Griffon and Anaconda meat.  On my server, Plant Shoots sell for an average of 40pp a piece, and Griffon/Anaconda meat from anywhere from 20pp to 50pp each.  Wolf Form is a key necessity here to reduce the aggro from mobs, but the poachers and gnolls will still attack you there no matter what form you're in.  

I think this zone offers alot to Druids and is a way for SoE to make up for all the money we lost or are losing due to the introduction of the PoK Books that have popped up all over the place.  

Good Luck and Happy Hunting!!

ummm.........did I miss something here?


not only is Jagged Pine safe, if it were ANY safer, I'd think I was in Gfay. 

Any druid with a right mind should know that its the KILLER zone for exp, semi decent loot (if you take the time to sell it), and to bake in (one of the reasons why the loot sells well). 

The key to venturing into Jagged Pine is wolf form, as almost all mobs will love you if you wear the form of a wolf. Just don't bother the poachers, gnolls and potomaids and they won't bother you. Don't go killing bears, wolves, etc (stick to griffons, griffawns, wisps (for loot) and :eek: anacondas--more for around 50, but killable in low 40s). 

You'll certainly be able to sell plant shoots. Its called for in many recipes with high trivials, so they can be used to build towards that elusive trophy. That said, few people are willing to pay more than 10p per in any of those things. If you kill griffons, griffawns and anacondas, you'll get lots of meat that sell for the very same reason. However, like I said, at least on my server, you're not gonna make 30p off any of those things lol. Maybe 10, and then you'll have to wait for someone working on their baking skills, which at that skill is once in a blue moon. 

If you really want to make money foraging, go to PoG and forage some planar branches. I sold one of those for 150 once (= Made me very sad when I had destroyed about 3 or 4 of them not knowing what they were used for.

lots of great zones to forage stuff. Western Wastes, PoG, JP, most of the planes, LoY and LDoN (newer recipes are more desired). That said, if you want to make cash at that lvl probably your best bet is Hill Giants in mostly RM. You won't bring them down too quick, but I started around 40, 41 on those. I bet I could have taken them at 39. I saved up a lot of money from that time, and still wear some of the things that I bought back then (mostly Acrylia stuff). 

most of the zones that you could forage stuff to sell off of would be fairly high lvl for you. While you could venture in safely to JP (you have wolf form), the kills at 39 wouldn't be easy. You could do it, but not overly efficiently, and some of the mobs there can be resisty. Most of them aren't, but you'd definately want to stay away from anacondas. You'd probably have to stick to Willowhisps and Griffenes there (not griffons, those are harder by almost twice as much). 

Hmmm...can't really remember what i was doing at 39. I think I may have been solo ing in Fronteir mountains, fighting those ugly giants /smile. There's a nice and safe spot nearby the fort on a hill, but its a real specific spot that someone would need to take you to. I also had the ability to KEI back then, so root/dotting would be a LOT more tedious for you. Heeh. Was so sad when they did that nerf. I was able to solo w/my ranger W/out EVER stopping lol. Eh, he'll soon be able to again.

I'm a human druid, just made 39 today. Been hunting HGs solo since 32. The trick is using snare and dot kiting.. too many resists and brief duration for roots to be efficient. Snare giant keep ahead just far enough to land 3 dots.. then run ahead a good ways and sit til it catches up. ;) Was kinda not so worth it til 34.. but after 34 it's easy.

I've also found that the cave basilisks in Jaggedpine are awesome from lo-mid 30's, as well. Being a skill freak, I like to keep even my melee skills max. Fear kiting basilisks, I have maintained max def 190 @ L38, with my offense lagging a bit at 188. At 5 AC per 2 def points, I think it's worth it. Besides when a giant lands a few hits, I'm hardly devastated ;)

Have kept all 3 weapon skills max for last 3 lvls.. I did however dump a lot of TPs in 2BH @ L35 when given an awesome weapon.

Also, I melee down in HPs often enough til I get bind max.. usually max defense before bind wound, but it works out pretty close.

I just did ding 39 and haven't checked yet, but at 38 all the cave basilisks and cb genitors were dk blue.

Hehe..I can see the use in maxing Defense, and offense..and I wield weapons and have a high 1hb skill for fun (may as well do something when I have too much aggro to sit)...but Bind Wound? Would have to be pretty dire circumstances to need it. I'd just assume wait a few extra secs to med and cast another heal. It would probably be more time efficient. Then again, you could be doing it just for fun (=

Bind wound is insanely useful for rangers tho, well, those who solo. Especially now that kei has been taken away till mid 40s. When I had a kei, it wasn't a very big deal using mana w/my Rangers lowly heals, but now it really is a huge mana sucker. So, I use my peircer that procs stacks of bandages till I get 5 or 6 stacks and bind when I go below 50 %. If I have mana at the time, I'll bring myself up to around 70 % or so, but as long as i'm at 50% it doesn't really matter. WHen I'm soloing if I lose any more than 5% of my HP, I didn't really do my best (this is against animals, mind you). However, I've been known to get hit for like 10% before...and a lot when fighting pretty tough things in which its hard to stick fear. That's when I'm being risky tho, and I can always run (=

If you are smart, you remove your +HP gear when you need to Bind Wounds and get some extra healing out of it... depending on how much of your total HP is the result of gear.

ie... if you have 2500 HP and 500 of that is from gear, with all your gear on, you could bind would to 1250 (50%).  If you take that gear off, you drop down to 750 out of 2000, which means you can keep binding till you have 1000 out of 2000 (50%).  Put your gear back on and you now have 1500 out of 2500 (60%).

Clever trick, Fletcher, I like it.

I've been soloing JP with my ranger for a few levels (48-51).  I wish I started there sooner!  It's great XP and pretty safe.  Rangers don't get Wolf Form till 49, and then it gets even safer.  But even before that the only thing that would add were griffon-types, and all you have to do is fear them and put some distance between you.  Get far enough away and they'll forget about you (until you get close again -- they must have bad eye-sight).

I soloed there a little bit in 51, but the XP didn't seem as good.  But still, if you want to solo for a little while and don't have time for a group, JP should still be okay for another level or two (with griffs at least, I haven't fought anything else there).
