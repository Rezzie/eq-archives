I want to kill Phinny and need some proven tactics for killing him.  I will not be able to get more than 2-3 groups together, because all my friends hate Kedge.

Does anyone have any good tactics on pulling his lair, and killing him and his seahorse friends?

Thanks.

This guy sux, lvl 53 wiz, 4 lvl 51 clerics, if you kill them , 2 lvl 54 clerics spawn next to phinny. Key to this is a good pull, every time ive gone, had to camp a cleric twice, if they pull more than 2 mobs, camp a cleric dude cuz its gonna be a cr. Good luck on the drop as well, ive killed phinny 7 times and no staff. Most people on Xev server semm to think it drops 
@ 1 in 20.
 Just my 2cp Goodd Luck

Have a 63+ Enchanter paicfy his guardians and then single pull him with a tank. All you need from there is a cleric. I took him out the other day with one cleric, enchanter, ranger.

What level are you?

I just finally finished up my epic about a month ago after a year of trying. I've went through about 50 Phinny kills. I finally decided to get it over with after I finally got the Fear piece after have the VS staff for several months. I placed a tracker in Kedge to keep track of his spawn times, and killed him about 4 times back to back. Had a shaman friend to help me camp his spawn when I wasnt online. He had to log ~ adn a bard came in to get Phinny, and shaman friend told him I've been on the lookout for the staff. The BCS dropped for the bard, so he informed me and we MQ'd it ~ and grats me on the Staff of the Four.

Anyways, I've tried soloing Phinny, I got him to about 10% life when I died. yay for him dispelling my forceshield. I never got to try my new altered plan of putting up junk buffs before my important ones. I've duoed Phinny with my shaman friend, was cake.

I have a guildie wizard who need the bard drop for her bard. Phinny was up, and we decided to go duo him. We got to the ledge, and we used Eye of Tallon to see if any of the sea horses saw invis, none did, so we invis'd up, and dropped down to Phinny's lair. Saw phinny, but he was a bit far away to pull with a spell, so I tried to edge closer, and I aggroed him. Me and the other wizard used a mix of Telekin and Strike of Solusek to kill him. Phinny never once dispelled us or tore through our rune. I think now I can prolly solo him now that I have the tactic down. He dropped 2 mage staffs that time >.&lt;

If you can't solo him, best thing to do is to get a chanter to help you out by pacifying the sea horses, and a puller to pull Phinny. I saw a grp of 58 cleric, 57 mage, 65 chanter, 56 monk, and a 61 bard do Phinny with no probelms. (the monk was the tank lol)

It make take you a time or two to get the strat down, but once you do it's easy. Good luck on the piece :)
