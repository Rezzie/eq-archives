This is my oppinion on zeb economy:it doesn't matter. You play on Zeb and thus pay Zeb prices, and if you feel a price is outrageous (as many many have said to mine ;) then don't buy it. Period.
I personally am very depressed with the market, as I see Lammies trading STRAIGHT ACROSS (thats right, STRAIGHT across) for a Centi. But hey, I do all i can selling my Centi LS for 1500-2k plat.
On the note of you noobs with no money. Your broke and you don't know what to do. Make a higher lvl friend/guild and borrow money. It works. I always pay my guild back--I think/hope--and I have very decent equipment (700 AC, 1500 hp, 246 unbuffed str/200+ sta) at lvl 32. This takes time, but you need to buy a good weapon or piece of armor that sells often- I use my TBB now, although patience if a virtue I sometimes don't seem to have in EC- but I would recomend buying an FBSS and selling it, and buying it, and selling it, and buying it and selling it, and buying it and selling  it, etc. It really works. Buy one fore 3k and sell it for 3500. You will sell fast. Some people have told me this is an evil way to get money...but they can be no less wrong. With me buying and selling Centi LSs or whatever, I am developing the economy and saving YOU time in EC buy buying what your selling for a lesser price or selling what you want for a marked up price. Now you noobs who are laughing, "How the f*ck am I going to get 3k!!! 8(" Well, as I admittedly did as a newby was beg. Be honest, however. Just say that your a noob who needs money to make money, but you don't have any. Now, i am not encouaging shouting, or repeating things, or being mean to those who don' give you money, just ask politly. This should be a last resort, but it may be usefull. As one person said, helping others works too. Bandaids, food, and water have a nice market, especially in the LoIO-- just shout that you are buying food and water for those who need the help for 1pp. This is a good way to make friends while making some money.
Also, for you sadly poor people around lvl 20&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CAMP IBC&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It is a great, easy camp (off a lvl 20 mob, easy for a lvl 25 char). It takes about 24 hours played time, but it gets you an Iksar Beserkers Club--sells for 2k I believe. Awesome. Simply amazing.
After rampling on about my personal beliefs (and contradicting myself once), I am finished.

Just curious, but why did you post this? Now, everyone knows that you mark-up your items, and consequentially WONT buy from you.     

What were you thinking?
