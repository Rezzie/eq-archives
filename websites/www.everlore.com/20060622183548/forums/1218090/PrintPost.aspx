I'm switching my main server from Stromm to the Rathe, and I have quite a bit of nice stuff on Stromm to trade for some decent stuff on Rathe.  Basically, I have a lot of tank and wisdom gear for trade while my friend who is also joining me on Rathe has some pretty good Int-caster items to trade.  What we ask in return is:

Decent stuff for an Iksar Shadowknight, mid-range stuff would be fine as long as I have a good amount of it.

Likewise, good mid-range stuff for a Gnome Magician.

So here's more info for what we have for trade on Stromm:

3 pieces of High Elven cultural armor (Blessed Full Mithril).  Specifically the Breastplate, Greaves, and Vambraces.  They have strict requirements (Only useable by 3 races and classes, and diety must be Tunare), and a recommended level of 46, but it is very nice armor.  If you cannot use it, you can always sell all 3 pieces.  On Stromm you'd get about 30k-35k for all three.

I have an abundance of mid-level melee armor.  My Cleric has most pieces of Sandblasted armor and my warrior has quite a few pieces of Crustacean armor along with a Kunzar Ku'juch.  You'll have to forgive me because I don't know off the top of my head every single piece of equipment I have, but it is fairly decent mid-to-high level stuff, most of which is great for twinking.

My friend has some good Int caster gear, including a cloak that's worth 14k among other things.  I don't know the details on what he has exactly because it's not my toon :P

If you're interested, contact me on Rathe.  I haven't created my SK yet but his name will either be Armodeus, Valdruss, or Daedriss.  If all those names are taken then I'll simply come back and tell you what mine is.
