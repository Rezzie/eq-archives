Boscarian,

Welcome to what may well be the biggest money sink in all of EQ.  First of all, while you can begin alchemy at lvl 25 you probably should wait until at least 29.  The reason for this is you can only raise alchemy skill to 5 at lvl 25 and 5/level after that.  Drop 20 trains into it at 29 and skillup the remainder doing potions.  What potions?  Personally I started making SoW potions since that's why I started alchemy in the first place.  Failure rate is high but at least you have something your alts can use (my cleric was VERY happy) or sell for a decent profit.

It will cost you approx (depending on faction and cha) 105pp for enough herbs to attempt 20 combines on SoW potions.  There are cheaper potions to make and skillup on but they don't sell well, so skilling up on SoW at least gives some return.  Once SoW goes trivial try IVU or shrink.  I've had limited success selling those to players.  I emphasize the selling to players bit because this represents the most economical path to skilling up.  If you are a high level shaman and not worried about plat dump the 20 training points and then just start pumping potions.  First SoW until it is trivial, then pick another off the list... and so on.

For a very complete guide to potions, costs, etc. go to <A HREF="HTTP://www.eqtraders.com" TARGET="_BLANK">www.eqtraders.com</A> and check out their alchemy pages.

I agree with the previous poster.  My shaman is 51 and has alchemy skill around 128, higher than anyone else I know personally.  I cannot tell you HOW MANY THOUSANDS of pp I have sunk into this addiction.

My advice to young shamans is to (a) save their money up, should have at least a K to start alchemy, and (b) save up your training points.  Dump them all (21 points) into alchemy at once at level 29 or 30.

DON'T do what I did and start alchemy with 5 points at level 25.  Really.  Waste of time and money and will just frustrate you.

And then think long and hard about progressing must past SoW potions. Ok, ok, there are high end potions wanted on raids.  Great, but that will take 10s of K out of YOUR pocket and nobody elses and you will never make any money from anything other than SoW, Ant (shrink), and ITU (invis to undead), and most of that will be from SoW.
