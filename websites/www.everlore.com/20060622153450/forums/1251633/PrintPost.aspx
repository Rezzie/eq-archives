Twinks...theres always going to be twinks, the Decade old discussion has been thrashed and killed and kicked so many different ways its sick.  This is not that topic, this is about the people being pked by twinks who fucking cry about it.  My names Rexlar, I'm a 23 ranger on Vallon Zek, just started 3 days ago, I'm wearing 3ac pants and 1ac boots, I am as noobie as it comes.  But I also am a veteran pker/dueler, I have a 65 rogue main on Test so I guess, not bragging here, but I know my shit when it comes to pvp.  Doesnt mean I dont get killed, shit happens, its war...

I guess my main bitch is the people that KNOW its PvP(Player Versus Player) when they hit "enter world" or "creat new character", and they should have known it was an 8 lvl differance.  But constantly I see ranting and raiving through just about every g'damn zone I walk into about people crying about being killed, or calling some twink an asshole cuz he has uber gear and he killed some "poor noobie", oh boo hoo, go tell someone who actually cares, which is probably your geek whiny friend standing right next to helping you cry at the zone.  

This is the way I look at it, I'm not crying cuz my gear sucks ass or I get smoked by some twink, which honestly isnt that often because I'm smart enough to know when to run and I know how to evade, or even kill them, if your on PvP..theres going to be twinks, theres going to be insane twinks, theres going to be twinks that know how to pvp, theres going to be twinks that shouldnt even play EQ because they suck so bad, theres all kinds, deal with it.  Or put that "twink" that just killed you on your friends list, get your ass in gear and lvl faster then him, and find that sob and kill him if it means that much to you, and your feelings are hurt that bad, or......plain and simple, get better at pvp, or learn how to run
