Are the people to talk to twinked?

At 19 about the only thing I can suggest is: Kill everything you can and loot everything you find and sell it to the NPC merchants.

If you can let your character sit in the Bazaar overnight, try selling stacks of spider(ling) silks or swatches or bone chips or snake eggs or rare things you forage.

Get your baking up and sell stacks of fish rolls.

Get your fletching up and try selling arrows?

With your main only being 19 you aren't going to be able to kill anything that carries tons of cash or even items that are worth more than a few plat each.

I think bandits in N.Ro carry weapons that sell for a few plat.  And I think there is a quest in East or West Karana where you can kill bandits, get an occasional sash, go to Qeynos and turn them in for items that sell for a few plat.

If you were an enchanter I'd say make Viscous Mana and sell it in the Bazaar.

If you were a shaman of high enough level you could make and sell SoW potions (and probably other potions).

If you were a gnome you could make and sell fireworks (actually I hear anyone has a chance of tinkering something, you just can't raise your skill).

Though the trade skill methods require a little bit of starting cash to get you started...

But basically, loot everything you can and sell it.  And level so you can kill tougher things that carry 
more loot.

Go to Erud's crossing and kill wisps. Collect all greater lightstones. Go to NK and give the greater lightstones to a woman gypsie in front of a wagon. She gives you a concordance of research for each greater lightstone you give her. Sell the concordance to another gypsie at the camp for roughly 8pp. Rinse repeat.

Hunt spiders, make silk swatches and sell them in the bazaar. Swatches sell on my server for 5-10 PP each, so if you get 1 stack of them that is 100-200 PP. Not bad for a couple hours work at 19th.

Hunt for pelts (LQ/MQ/HQ Wolf/Cat/Bear) which sell for 1PP-30PP each. I must admit I had 10K by the time I was 25th level, but I am a master potter and I got into the Small Wisdom Deity craze back when they sold for 200-250 each.

Listen to Raidel's method. That is EXACTLY what I did with my first character. The druid will get platinum quickly at higher levels with quad kiting mobs.

Some hunting and loot spots the solo way except for paludal and HHK.

Paludal Caverns from 14 - 24, tou can actually start even earlier. But anyway, bandits have good drops.

HHK 24-34 Good loot here to for your level.

EW 34-41 - Do Ulthork tusk quest and collect Veliun weapons I believe. This can be done at lvl 34 or so. Quad Kite here. Great XP and loot.

Oasis 42-48 - Kill spectres. Easy, good , XP and Loot isn't bad. Quad.

Spirocs in TD I believe 48-51. Bad Loot BUT greta XP . Quad

51- ? - I have a druid that hunts in CS but haven't played him for 6 mos. got bored. Great loot and XP killing Wyverns here!

You can also go to Rathe Mountains and kill hill giants. I'm not sure what level a druid can do this. I just went there at High levels for quick cash. Don't have to worry about KSr's ussually being a druid. Some silly Wizzies would get me every once in a while.

I have worked out a method for my money.  It keeps me occupied and I get to know how Norath can be scaled easily.  First off head to FP and collect about 20 stacks of spider silk it's realy easy in the commons (they sell about 3 pp each 60 pp per stack easily).  Then I take a boat ride over to the elven lands (fishing all the way in the ocean of tears, picking up some rare fish and stuff).  Then when I get their I go to the moon.  On the moon you sell the silks and the fish for around 500 pp and then take your time to find any piece of armor with plus stats that is from 5 - 20 pp and buy it.  Then when you head back to norath to pick up more spider you make a hotkey that states the stats asking people to please send tells.  People will send tells and because of the +stats, try to look for the biggest newbie Ebay/twink.  They tend to WAY overpay.  You can make anywhere from 25 - 75 pp on each of the items that you bought it you hold out long enough.  Then when you have all of the spider silks time for another long haul to the moon (druids can port near norath spires in you want to be spead up).  Back at the moon... Sell the spider silks for another 500 pp and take all the extra money you made off of the items.  This is all money in the bag.  Take about 1 1/2 hours if you speed kill.  Depending on the zone you go to for spider silks also.  Remeber just because one spider silk only sells for 3 pp does make it bad 20 sells for 60 pp and that only takes one inventory slot.  Try auctioning in the bazaar the silks.  Spiderling silks go for 30 pp per stack.  If you want to speed up the process head to the barbian tundra and collect the spiderling silks.  Hope this helps all of you.
