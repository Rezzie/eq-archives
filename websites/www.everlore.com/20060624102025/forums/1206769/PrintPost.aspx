Is it just me or do a lot of people on our server act like children and try to bully from behind their keyboards?  I will only cite one example and it is a rather annoying example, but it is only one of MANY examples of the dredge of players that are (unfortunately) gaining higher levels.

I myself have only two characters that are above level 30.  I spend quite a bit of time in South Karana and know if quite well.  I currently solo Tecsh Mas Gnolls at the spires for relatively stress-free albeit somewhat slow XP gain.  I've grouped in HPK and Paw but usually find that the gain is faster and less stress-inducing while soloing outside.  Don't think that I don't like grouping, but I spend most of my time online talking to another guildmate on the phone while playing.  In groups this is iffy at best and usually results in me standing around looking like I'm comatose due to trying to pay attention to too many things.  When not on the phone I love to group.

Now, on the annoying story.  While soloing the hill in South Karana someone shouts that they want to know if Brother Qwinn is up and they offer a 2pp reward for a location.  I (of course, since I'm soloing AND always trying to have fun and poke fun at EQ) reply with a comment about 2pp being a great bounty if you're ready to die by Brother Qwinn's hand.  Basically, if 2pp is all you an afford, then methinks Brother Qwinn would whoopa you good.  Several people in the zone agreed with me immediately.  Of course this totally pissed off the 42 Iksar Monk who obviously can't take a joke, but the guy /shouting in the first place was only level 29 or so.

So, why is this a stupid and annoying story?  Well, the 42 Iksar Monk had his 29 druid friend track me.  They found me about two minutes after I stated that they would most likely be killed by Brother Qwinn.  I was soloing many, many gnolls and at the time they found me I was engaging yet another runner at the hill.  I had about 5 mana (enough for a Yaulp) and almost two whole life bubbles left.  I'm level 32 when this happens.  So I have maybe 250hp give or take.  I'm a Half-Elf Paladin so hit points aren't my strong suit. =)  So Iksar boy, WHILE I'm getting beat up by this gnoll, and kind of losing, /duels me and says, "let's do thiz thang! =p"....

To which I replied, "If you haven't noticed, I am a tad busy at the moment."

So the big bad Iksar 42 monk wanted to duel someone 9 levels lower than him simply because he offered 2pp for a location and got zinged.  Ok, he wouldn't have even gotten zinged in the first place had he offered NO bounty.  In fact the day before at the south spire I actually saw Brother Qwinn FIVE times AND shouted every time I saw him!  Of course, no one that I noticed needed him at the time, but Cie La Vie I guess, eh?

So it all comes down to, and I really hate to have to say this, but the STUPID, RETARTED, LOSERS who you NEVER would have hoped got out of Oasis of Marr because they couldn't group or fight worth a plugged nickel have somehow figured out how to get past level 30 and now 40.

The only problem with this?  I keep telling my friend whom I talk on the phone with while playing that the people, generally the higher in level you go, DON'T take themselves THAT seriously AND are nice, as far as I've seen anyway up until now, AND almost always result in a pleasant experience.

I hope that this is the last of these said encounters or I may return to the "spooky quietness" of Anarchy Online.... simply because I don't have to listen to it.

Note for you - probably would have been better if you hadn't /shout'ed or /ooc'ed that.  Don't you think?  Sure, it doesn't excuse his stupidity, but why start a fight...yes, you did, stop saying you didn't.  You made a joke, at his expense, which basically taunted him.  Very unpaladin-like at that.

Understand that I'm not picking on you, but I wanted to make sure you realized your error.

PS - once you get up to your mid 30's, head to Dawnshroud Peaks and solo Zelniaks near the Grieg's End zonline.  I went, with my Paladin, from mid 30's to lvl 40 there, no problem. :)  Good luck.

Advice from some gay guy that likes to post a half naked female cartoon image as his sig?

Anyways...

My point is this.. if you cannot deal with a tiny bit of abuse for dishing out some abuse in OOC then you better stop playing on Saryrn now.

If you make it to post 50 you will find yourself shut out and branded unless you kiss ass.  I can tell your not the type to kiss ass.

Heh...I'd edit out your comments, but they are a good example of a) stupidity, b) ignorance, c) immaturity, and d) why anons shouldn't be allowed to post.

Instead...welcome to perma-ban. :)

Hehe Nos, I admire you =P You always seem to deal with things in the best possible way. That seems to be hard for a lot of people (including me sometimes) - But! anyway


I agree with Nos on the error part - That when you make jokes, you have to be prepaired sometimes with the people that "don't get them" or are "offended" by them - and then have respect for them (im talkin in general, not about what you did)

Some people just aren't born with a sence of humor, so no matter what we do, or what we say (or what we mean.) - things just aren't funny to them

yea, unfortunatly there are jerks on this server.  but i have also met ALOT more cool people than jerks.  too many awesome people to name, hehe, but you guys know who you are.  while I may be only 17 irl, i try to act the way i would want to be treated.  I never had a problem w/ joking around, anyone who groups or is in the same zone w/ me knows that when the mood strikes me, i will start an in zone conversation and/or argument, just to talk.  my fav convo starter is i /ooc so...who likes metallica?   there is always opposing viewpoints on Metallica =).  but anyone who knows me knows that talking in game, and even arguments, are a part of the way i play, and I never have hard feelings, and i KNOW that ALOT of people on saryrn feel the same way.  I have met more good than evil, and you just have to deal w/ the few bad eggs, and make friends w/ the good ones.  

sounded like he couldnt take the joke, but o well.  I certainly hope hte post 50 game isnt as was described a few threads up. kissing ass is never fun, i would rather get groups and raids based on my merits, not how well i shoved my head up someones ass.  

I'm looking for a place to hunt w/ my bard, so maybe i will take a look at dawnshroud peaks.  he is parked in splitpaw, where i had to log last night right after ding, and i want a change of scenery.  what would be a good zone to hunt in for my bard?  I need to learn how to kite using the bard, its alot more involved than my druid, and i'm assuming I would need wide open spaces to do so.  When I get a chance, I play around w/ him.  Charm kiting, and bellow kiting I have pretty much down.  its fear kiting, and whatever other methods a bard has at his disposale I cant get.  anyone wanna post w/ some advice? for now i'll stay in paw or SK until i get my lazy arse up to dawnshroud

Well no one will ever find me kissing ANYONE's ass so if I can't find a group in those uberzones, too bad.  I'll find my own way to the top.

As for something not being very 'paladin-like' that's kinda too bad too.  I have a great sense of humor and love it when people give strange responses to questions.  The only thing that irritated me was that someone had the nerve to duel when I am almost dead.  That kind of behaviour belongs on the PvP servers.  I don't spend $13/month to deal with babies on a daily basis.

If I wanted to deal with babies and yutzes I'd have become a Guide.
