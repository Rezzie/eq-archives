Hello, Im a person who plays on the Drinal Server and just got into trade skills for the mollah. (I need more!) I already am a master in blacksmithing, not very far...about 120...And something that seems to me to be profitable would be armor dyeing. And I have a couple of questions. (1) What professions should I be proficient in to sucessfully make dyes on my own? (2) How does one make a "Prismatic Dye"? (3) If you need a blacksmith to dye your armor, what is that "Dye" button in the invitory? (4) Lastly, Does anyone have a link to a website that can help me? or even another Forum Thread that I misses?         -Thank You For Reading

Okay, to clear a few thing up dood.
1) I have no clue how to go about making the dye, and I dont believe it really matters if you are good at smithing to be able to make it.
2) When using LoY to dye your armor, you arent really dying the armor, just the slot. If you would click on the dye button you would see that. It costs like 40pp a dye maybee less if you buy in the bazaar.
3) Anyone that has purchased the dye from the bazaar (or made it themselves)can dye thier own slots only, and you do not have to be a blacksmith to do this, anyone can dye as long as they have LoY.

So briefly, don't waste your time trying to make dyes. I think you are kind of mixing up info on how they used to make old dyes and how to apply new dyes. Have fun.

"Don't waste your time making dyes."

On the contrary...it is a great way to make money. I've made tons.

You need decent brewing (or alchemy) and pottery.  Go to the Lighthouse in Gunthak (zone off Stoneburnt).  There is a female merchant there (last name Brohat I think).  Buy the top four things in her inventory.  The crystal-thing and the jar go in a brew barrel.  Combine the vial and the sheet of metal in a kiln.  Then take those two results and combine them in a brew barrel and you get Prismatic dye.

They cost about 30p to make but sell for 45p on Lanys.  And they are still a hot seller.

And as the previous poster mentioned, anyone can dye their own armor without fear of failure.  They just need the LoY expansion.  There are seven slots you can dye and it takes one vial of Dye to change one slot. Be careful and make sure you have the colors you want.  Once you hit Save Dye you'll have to use another vial to change the color again.  

And it's more of a tint than a complete dye.  I have a yellow robe, but if I dye it blue it looks green. (You can test the colors all you like as long as you don't hit the Save button.)

So as long as you aren't on Lanys, make dye, sell it in the Bazaar, and make money!
