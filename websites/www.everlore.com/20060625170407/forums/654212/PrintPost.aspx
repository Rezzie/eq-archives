See we got LoY LDoN and GoD...

Now for the real questions:
With all these new expansions and me being a level 40 Cleric, where is the best place for me to level?  I know people say DL is good, but to tell you the truth, I don't really like DL.  Where are some good places to level with groups.  I have done LDoN from 35 and am looking for a little variety.  I wanna start doing planes groups at 46 and am looking for a good place to get it.

Also I still have tailored gear.  Good gear dont' get me wrong, but is it time for me to upgrade to plate armor?  I was thinking about spending my adv points on a good BP it had +5sta +5wis +10hp mana and end.  Even though my current chest is +8wis I think I can pick up the 3 wis in another slot.  anyone know whats a good, under 10k BP?

Mistmoore theme, 150 adventure points.  Pretty darn nice if you ask me, if you can hold out until 45.  I'd just keep doing LDoN for that, or head over to the LoY zones and start looking for the temperance quest.

I know the AC isn't as high as you might be able to get, but I love the Phase Spider Carapace for the no required level restriction and all the nice stats on it.  It doens't seem to common on my server, but it shoudl sell for less than 10k easily. Then you can resell it later when you outgrow it. Also, it isn't really plate, but it looks kinda like it when you are wearing it.

Phase Spider Carapace

AC: +28 Str: +6 Dex: +5 Sta: +9 Cha: +6 Wis: +6 Int: +7 Agi: +8 Fire Resist: -3 Disease Resist: -4 Cold Resist: +5 Magic Resist: +9 Poison Resist: +8 HP: +25

There is also a LoY drop from Gunthak that you might try. It has slightly higher AC, but overall it isn't as good.

Dented Brass Cuirass
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
Weight: 3.4 Size: LARGE 
Slot: CHEST  
AC: +30 Sta: +6 Wis: +6 Int: +6 HP: +20 Mana: +20  

Gunthak Harbor may also be a good place to try to fight for you. There are lots of undead on the beach.
DL is where the crowds are so a group may be easier to get, but it isn't the best spot for xp.

Anyway, I am not a cleric, I just wanted to give my 2cp.  Good luck.

Thanks, i think I will save up my points..I made it 40 levels withmy current gear, I think I can manage 5 more...  I was thinking about it and I kinda like the idea of doing 5 more levels of LDoN good points and good gear.

Well time to go rack up them MM Points.

There's a error on Everlore so I cannot login.

Im a 65 Dwarf Cleric, and I have been looking at these post obivously to long. I have seen so many people asking where to level what gear is the best. Did anyone that started this game from the beginging need to ask these questions? I sure didn't, why can't these kids try new places and stop repeating themselves. Drothor you have made 2 threads that I have seen so far (didn't look to much) got annoyed. You got a answer the first time why ask again? What you gained a level and decided to make another thread?

As far as your gear, I can understand you asking that. Why don't you just save your money if your doing so well with your gear atm and spend it wisely on what you need no need to upgrade and waste time buying and selling go level.

Is this your first high level character? Because you must no know to much about the game. If you wanted good experience and you could get it from DL? Go there and get it who cares if you don't like it alot of people live with things that they don't like.

If you can't decide where to level how about posting in one thread and not making more. Its not that hard to find a place to level. Just do like all the other kids that get there stuff for free without leveling and just buying and selling. Get power leveled that might work. Less fun but atleast you will know where to level as I see your in a guild. Ask one of them to show you where to level instead of filling the forums with your bs about where you need to level and you whinning about dl. If you are getting good xp why not stay there? 

You sound like a 14 year old that spent to much money on this game and just one get leveled fast and doesn't wanna spend real time finding where to go and actually learning how to play this game.

All I got to say is grow up and quit the game go find some friends and if that fails [edit].

Let me know about these, Aeg, instead of just commenting on them.  I lucked into it.

Anon wasn't really that rough until his last sentence.  W/o it, his advice is good for quite a few people.

And of course I missed out on the good stuff.  ROFL.

It is true that the people who first started out in EQ didn't go to a message board and ask where the best places to go, etc...  etc...

But, I'll bet you that most of the people who started at the beginning talked to each other and discussed what they found and what they were doing to get by.

I'm not saying it's cool to beg for a full spoiler, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with asking the advice of more seasoned players.

I did LDoN from about 35 until 46 and made myself pretty sick of it.  LDoN is a decent place for XP and equipment...  I pretty much only do adventures now if a guildy begs me..  ROFL.

I will be doing them again, though, as LDoN has gear and augs that is considerably better than anything else I can get my hands on, at least until I am elemental flagged.

Best of luck to you...

On LDoN, I played them to death until about 53 when I started trying all sorts of areas: Dulak, LGuk, PoN, PoD, PoJ.  Then I started an alt SK because my group of friends collectively started alts to balance our group out so we can go anywhere.  We started LDoN's again at 20.  My goodness, they are easy.  We do 3-4 person groups and kick ass all over the place.  I do think though, they are perhaps the best group exp and loot from 20-45 if you are strapped for cash or gear.

No im just stating, that he has posted twice about the same thing he just changed the name to All These New Expansions. Thats stupid stop asking where to level. Take the first advice someone said and stop asking you gained 1 level and that was it
