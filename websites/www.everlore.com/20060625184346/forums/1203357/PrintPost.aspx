FIRST OF ALL I DID NOT ATTACK YOU, you attacked me and I defended myself and you being a nazi admin decided to lock me out of replying to your replies. 
SECOND OF ALL, as an admin why don't you fix the site so i can register, its been 3 weeks now that I keep recieving the same unsuccessful message for registering each time i try to register. 
THIRD OF ALL if you havn't played on a pvp server how the hell you going to comment on pvp related content and then claim all pvper's as annoying; come on you just post stuff without backing it up (saying something you want to stay doesn't make it true). Stay on your blue server if you even still pvp. 
FOURTH I havn't disobeyed any forum rule so don't give me that bull. And I havn't even attacked you in any negative manner.
LASTLY grow up yourself. Does it make you feel better at night to reply to posts you dont like attacking the author and then locking it so others can't reply (thereby giving yourself last words)? THIS WILL BE MY LAST POST anyone who has reads the previous posts can see you have no pvp mindset (you just arn't quick enough for the lifestyle), you misquote, misjudge, lie your ass off and plain out say anything you want to say as FACT and not oppinion. I quit playing eq over a year ago, I'll be playing eq 2 on the first red server as Carribian. When you said "im done" in the last post I would bet everything I owned on seeing just "one more post" from a guy who obviously has nothing better to do with admin powers than to talk shit on people without a way to back it up. GO AHEAD AND BAN ME. THIS IS MY LAST POST. MY WORD IS MY WORD. 

-Carribian (only thing i did was recharge i-hoops and set up scams; hp zone trick was to answer the endless questions people were asking on red servers in /ooc. But obviously you wouldn't know this since you never played on a RED. STAY BLUE CAREBEAR im done with you)

Oh, and I won't lock this one...since I did give a "last post" and you seem so upset about me locking them so you can't respond.

But, I'll probably end up locking it because it'll just turn in to a flame thread.

<font style=font-size:7pt>FIRST OF ALL I DID NOT ATTACK YOU, you attacked me and I defended myself and you being a nazi admin decided to lock me out of replying to your replies.</font>

Yes, I minorly flamed you for your first post.  That wasn't an attack.  You did attack me first in your second post because you were upset I locked the first (and probably a bit peeved at my flamage).  See that phrase "nazi admin"?  That's an attack.  One of the worst attacks you can use a <b>Moderator</b> (I bold that for a reason, but more later).  I also told you how to reply to me, but you decided to post another attack in your third (and this, your fourth, if I remember correctly, post).
 
<font style=font-size:7pt>SECOND OF ALL, as an admin why don't you fix the site so i can register, its been 3 weeks now that I keep recieving the same unsuccessful message for registering each time i try to register.</font>

Um, not an admin...never claimed to be an admin.  I'm a Moderator.  That's a volunteer who doesn't get paid but gives up their time to help police the board and help people.  Been doing this for 3+ years now, easily.  It is nice to hear that you are trying to register - and I mean that seriously.  It means you're willing to back up your posts with an identity instead of remaining anonymous.  However, the fixing of the registration process is not in my hands.  I've e-mailed the actually admin multiple times.  That's the extent of my ability in that situation.  Sorry, wish I could do more.
 
<font style=font-size:7pt>THIRD OF ALL if you havn't played on a pvp server how the hell you going to comment on pvp related content and then claim all pvper's as annoying; come on you just post stuff without backing it up (saying something you want to stay doesn't make it true). Stay on your blue server if you even still pvp.</font>

I can comment on PvP related content quite easily.  Just because I don't play on one doesn't mean I don't read about it or talk to people who do.  I'm not a licensed or certified computer tech, either, but I know quite a bit about it.  That mean I shouldn't comment about it?

Also, I never - <B>not once</b> - claimed "all pvps are annoying".  I said the majority, and I stand by it.  All it takes is 51% to be a majority, but I'd be willing to bet it's much closer to 80% or more.  But wait, you then say, "Stay on your blue server if you even still pvp."  I just finished telling you, and you repeating it to me...I don't play on PvP servers.  You have reading comprehension problems, don't you?
 
<font style=font-size:7pt>FOURTH I havn't disobeyed any forum rule so don't give me that bull. And I havn't even attacked you in any negative manner.
LASTLY grow up yourself. Does it make you feel better at night to reply to posts you dont like attacking the author and then locking it so others can't reply (thereby giving yourself last words)?

GO AHEAD AND BAN ME. THIS IS MY LAST POST. MY WORD IS MY WORD.</font>

I've gone over the "attacking me" part, but as for forum rules.  Yes, you have.  You posted exploits, and cheats.  By nature, those are against the rules.  No, it doesn't say it verbatim in the rules, but it shouldn't need to either.  But forget that, I TOLD you in my very first post (in response to your very first post in this debacle), that it was.  I didn't punish you in any way.  I informed you, and closed the thread.  End of story.  At least it should have been.

You say I'm not "quick enough for the lifestyle"?  No, I'm too mature.  You have no idea who you're talking to, nor can you tell from my posts just how quick-witted I really am.  So who's saying something as fact when it's opinion, and bad opinion at that?

I don't misquote, or lie (now, I do misjudge - I don't think so in this case, but it's entirely possible).  You broke the rules, I stopped it.  Then you attacked me, and I stopped it again.  For a third time, you attacked me (by now, I'm sure I've attacked back...just so you know I'm not saying that I didn't) and I stopped it.  All of those times w/o any punishment when normally an unregistered person (yes, I realize you tried) would be suspended or banned for what you've already done.

As for betting for one last post?  Yep, you're damn right.  I could have just deleted this thread, banned you, and ended it there.  Frankly, you're giving me something to do.  You stopped playing EQ over a year ago, but you come here to post anyway?  Sad, man.  You thought you were helping people, but maybe you didn't read my post.  Most of your cheats/exploits...they've been fixed.  You can't use them.

So, what's even worse is, you've gotten all upset because I stopped you from posting cheating/exploiting information....and it's mostly useless.  Even more sad.

<font style=font-size:7pt>
-Carribian (only thing i did was recharge i-hoops and set up scams; hp zone trick was to answer the endless questions people were asking on red servers in /ooc. But obviously you wouldn't know this since you never played on a RED. STAY BLUE CAREBEAR im done with you)</font>

Hmm...you quite playing over a year ago, but somehow know what people are saying in /ooc.  That means that either you didn't really quit, or are posting from /ooc's over a year old.  Or, albeit, you got some info from friends that still play.  Doesn't make less pathetic, actually.

You just blatantly admitted you posted two exploits - recharging items, and the low hp / zone trick.  That's what started this all.  They are exploits, plain and simple.  Exploiters are cheaters...also plain and simple.  Cheaters, at other people's expense, are losers.  That may be opinion, but it's just slightly away from fact.

So long, it's been fun.  Have fun in EQ2, seriously.  But if you don't play EQ, and don't have any pertinent info that could help anyone...then stay away from Everlore.  I don't want you here.

As far as PvPers being annoying, that is not entirely correct.

I was surprised too when i went to Sullon, i thought i would see mass HahAhIpwnZ0r you L053R!!1!!.

But really most of PvP are people who played on another server and started anew here, as myself

But there are kids who still do that but most are weeded out past 40.

so now its..79% annoying 21% not annoying :P

Oooh, brother.  Registering...  getting locked out of one's account...

I'm not going to live that nightmare.  

As far as the post, I didn't read it.  It gave me a headache just looking at it.  I did read Nos' responses though.  I fear I got the gist...

Ah well.
