Im a lv 52 cleric. Ive been in 2 guilds since lv 1. Both being "social" guilds.  While the one im in now does do a friday night Kael raid (if we get enough people).
I have been asking the people Ive grouped with about thier guilds and what are the requirements to join, and what not.  Most have something like 3 references just to be looked at. Others have a lv min of 55 :(

What im looking for is to join a guild i see on <a href="www.everquestraids.com">Everquest Raids</a> that will have a event like 3-5 nights a week. i.e: Blood and Loyalty, of the Seekers, Pak'Cafan, The Sense, The Syndicate (wich ive been trying to get into since lv 25,wich was thier previous lv min. And Ive applyed 5 times with no reply ) 

Ive been to the Plane of Hate 1 time (while i was luckly enough to get my EM BP and EM Vambs) still. Ive only been to a plane 1 time!!!

Please tell me how to get into those guilds I mentioned above.
Am I not high enough lv for them?
Am I doing something wrong?  I like to think that I play my class well. The 1 planer raid I went on, I was commended on what a good job I did. :) I group well, always loot "need before greed" and am a prety funny guy to talk to ( at least i think)

Please, any information on how to get into the higher raiding guilds would be MUCHO appreciated.

Well, I have a friend in Blood and Loyalty I could talk to.  Also, I have a friend in Translucent who I could talk to.  If you would like to talk to them, the one in Blood and Loyalty is Teaerin and the one in Translucent is Zygat/Sspirit.  Tell em Grabe recommended you.

I hear B&L is very corrupt at the top of the chain, and getting decent loot is very hard since the officers and popular people get dibs on it. Now this is just what I've heard from 3 or 4 ppl that have since moved on to other guilds.

The synd is nice but hey are also HUGE so they can do lots of stuff =P, although it's more a zerg fest then a raid.

Pak'Cafn is very nice, a bit zergish, but lots of fun to hang out with. I did a hate raid with them once, they brought like 30ppl (I've normally done hate with 1 or 2 groups)

Of The Seekers are an ok guild, don't try to become part of the guild's governing body, because there isn't one. You have this dude and his wife who lead the guild, whatever they say goes. Not sure if your up for that.

The Sense is an interesting guild. They at one point had a very bad rep. But, seem to be cleaning up a lot. They've have several leaders lately. I don't know what's up with that. 

My Opinion.
Meet people in the guild who's rules and policy fit with your EQ playing style and desires. Then become friends with them. If you make a mark with one or 2 people when you go to apply you are sure to have their support. Which could only increase your chances of sucess. Of course provided that these people arn't the ones in the guild that people don't like.

Cheers.

Nutzy, GM of B&L, is one of the best people you could ever be lucky enough to meet in EQ.  His officers are a little sketchy at times (we've had a few run-ins with them), but Nutzy himself is a badass.

My suggestion is simply this - hang out with people, make sure to let them know that you're interested in raiding with them.  Oftentimes, guilds will gladly jot cleric's names down for contacting in the future as your class sometimes comes up short of supply.  

Good luck =)

PPS. The best way to find a guild is just ot hang out with people. get to know them. Ask to come along. make sure they know you arn't there for loot.
