</FONT><HR>What drug are you taking? With all the little nerf'ing going on, and a couple of songs getting a smaller radius, now we are even less efficient than before. Verant keeps making our character a liability in the game, and our chances of getting group'd are now less that ever. Already half the people are saying the invisible stuff doesn't work ... you see, no one at Verant plays a mid level Bard, and never will. It is all coming from the mind, of some programmer, and that turkey needs a shower ... of manure, on his desk.<P>Moshkiae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=15&topic=000329.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Bard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=bards+rule">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR><BR> Moshkiae- I have no idea what you are talking about, really.<BR>  Problems grouping at mid-level? News to me. Heck, when I zone in and call out «Silly Bard looking for a party» I have to refuse offers! Case in Point- SK . I started in SK soon after 20th and began grouping with 27th, 28th and 30s ( at Paw- no less!)and they were more than glad to have me (combat speed, restoration afterwards, AE slow, DD, mass lull, expert puller or comabt-kiter if need be and nothing else would work - I could pull more than my share of work and they all knew it)<BR>    But, to be fair and myabe provide a partial answer to your situation (maybe...), I must say that I have been told that my roleplay was as much a factor in being called in as my actual power. People love original compositions and silly bardic emotes and jests. In fact, they more or less *expect it*. <BR>  Power-wise, all bards are equal (or just about). But a Bard that enjoys his/her craft and roleplays it to the hilt IMHO (always) stands much better chances of grouping- no matter the rad os our songs )<P>   Just my two bits...<P>   Tinthin Talltales- 30th on prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=15&topic=000329.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Bard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=bards+rule">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr >

</FONT><HR>>>>Moshkiae, do yourself a favor and stop reading bulletin boards. Sure, there's a great deal of whining going on about stats and nerfing and smaller radiuses going on right now, but the only reason you'd know about it is that you've been taking other people's "facts" for granted.<<<<P>I don't think so. There is a lot of information out there and not all of is is incorrect, or off base, and you know that.<P>The Restoration radius is a fact, and my roomie can also show it. I had marked off a spot and had him move until he was no longer getting the effect -- we have a network, and three players, etc, etc, and can do this screming into the next room -- <P>If I take a sort of "yard" type of measuring stick, this has been diminished some, fo rsome reason, and not documented, or mentioned anywhere. I would say about 5 to 10%, probably relative to the same amount changed on the radius for the Accelerando and such, in the opposite direction.<P>While I can not look at all the code that goes into these things, one thing is very clear in this game ... that there is a lot of code that interplays with other schemes, and when direction changes, another is affected by it. This is making things rather difficult to fix and adjust, and even Abashi has mentioned that some changes are virtually impossible because it would require a complete code rewrite. <P>Basically, I think that some of these avenues of code need a rewrite, not just a tweak here and there, which is making things obviously convoluted codewise. It does not take a genius to notice this and the packet size variations and bruhaha's that Verant has been having issues with for months pretty much shows that there are issues that better code'ing and organization of such code would improve things significantly.<P>All in all, it is a reflection of the leadership. Period. When the leadership displays a total lack of understanding and view point in their conversations, you know that they are so wrapped up in it, that they can not see objectively enough to even answer questions in a truthful manner. Basically, it is a programmer trying to deny that things are difficult and he needs help, but he has no idea where to start to fix it ... this has been my experience in this business. Not enough humility, and desire to communicate. These people will make money for a little bit, but then their product will die. <P>I happen to like Everquest, and would like to see many things added to it. I'm sorry that to you, my view points do not display a "visionary" approach, but instead comes off as negative. Far from the truth. <P>>>>Go play. You won't even notice a difference.<<<<P>It's easily noticeable, when you use the very items that are touched.<P>>>>If you have trouble grouping, maybe it's your attitude.<<< <P>I don't have much trouble grouping, since the majority of people I work with know my abilities and that I make a strong effort to keep everyone in one piece. I get many more compliments than I do anything else, with the exception of one particular player, who was power leveling three other players of my level, and when a pop took place on top of me by accident, he would not do anything about it, and I finally shouted "Pull them off, Jerk" ... and their party members did so. I'm sure that particular player (a Bard, no less) is not gonna look kindly on me, but I did not take their kills, or raised a weapon for one second, and left the kills for them only. Yes, I was disrespectful and I apologize, but they had room in a group and could easily have taken another one, but what the heck ...<P>Other than that, yes, I do play, and I enjoy things. Not playing prime time hurts, though. I get home from work at 1AM PST, and by that time, for example, Highpass only had 8 other players and 6 of them were in a group. Kinda makes it hard to work, when the class is so group oriented. This has very little to do with personality, or attitude.<P>My abilities, at least via the majority of players I work with, are not in question, and have never been. The only thing that I have added to my character and its abilities, is that I DO read, AND study, the songs and how to use them. If you think this is not a helpfull addition to the game .. I can't help that.<P>Moshkiae</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana">IP: <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=15&topic=000329.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Bard|APO|s+Forum&TopicSubject=bards+rule">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><P>All times are PT (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana"><A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000329&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.everlore.com/boards/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum15&number=15&thisthread=000329&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
