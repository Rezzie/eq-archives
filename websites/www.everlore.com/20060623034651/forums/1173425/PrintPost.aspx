I have a Ulthork Hide Tunic AC 13/(gives me ac20)+3 Wis
+35 mana/ -5cha/ -35hp/. I'm a low level Halfling Druid
and some nice guy gave this to me. Because I'm low level I can't take the minus hit points to well. I would think a higher LVL Cleric or Druid could stand the loss not being in direct melee as much as other classes. It does give a very nice AC with Wis and Mana together whitch is hard to find. Not sure but depending on your level that wis/Mana combination could result in close to +100 mana.
Anyway, it's for sale, make an offer.

I wear one of those now at 33 and you will want it badly at 18-22 when you really begin to kite.  I understand that hp hit might be alot now, but dont swap it out so fast. You will get money later no problem but if it were me, I would save it and get a cheap reninforced leather or something.  At level 18 you also will start to notice the need for wis.  so I say keep it, put it back on at 14ish when you will stop mele any way.

I was thinking the same thing. I wear a foremans tunic now ac10/3str/3wis/wt.0.0. The only problem is MONEY NOW! I'm almost LvL 7 and those LvL 9 spells are comming up. They're about 5P EACH! and then some! That means 50p for most of the good ones. Being short and ugly my CHA is only 50 and the money making opertunities in misty thicket are not that great. The way it looks now I will be LvL 14 when I'm able to buy my 9th L. spells. I know what you're saying tho and equipment always has been my first love in this game. My LvL 18 ranger is pretty stacked for His LvL. Almost full Ivy Etched, cept boots and gloves and lots of expensive jewely ect.
I'm not even sure on a price range for this tunic. I checked everywhere. The closest I came was a guy in a post said He sold His for 800p.(not sure the server or how realistic that is.)
Anyway I might hang on to it. My ranger is "trying to help" the little guy out but it can become a strain to supply two players with one's resources!
Thanks for the advice and let me know if you know a price range or there-a-bouts.

I would think it was worth only about 150pp maybe. As for spell money you will want to go to east commons and kill orcs, sell the belts by the stack for as much as you can. You will see quickly how much they go for.  At level 6 kill bixies and get a bunch of those honey combs.  try and seel them to enchanters level 12-20 who should all be doing the Stein of Maggokk quest. Druids get rich fast.  When you get your port spells, I dont even mean the group ones, just the ones for you.  you will loot everything that drops in zones where no one can sell. You bind, port, sell, gate back. it doesnt seem like a lot but bronze will get you hundreds of plat before you even see level 20. Get in groups at 14, every one wants your sow/heal so you really only need to buy sow at 14, then go to SK and sow for donations. At 18 go to stonebrunt.  you will loot so much stuff and port to NK, sell at the ring then gate back all in a couple minutes.  my 33 druid financially supports 2 alts, and has more dough then my 51 enchanter.  I guess my point is as a druid dont even worry about money, it will come to you soon enough.

Thanks soo much for the advice! I'd been selling those honey combs to the merchants for next to nothing. I will ask ya a couple question tho. What do the combs go for and I've heard of the DFB's (orc belts) before but are they like the Crush bone belts like a plat a pc?
Thanks so much, that advice from someone who knows is REALLY valuable to someone trying to make it.
