First, I want to say that the bard rocks. I've played my pally up to 58 and got tired of waiting hours for a group, plus Half-Elf plate graphics are kinda weak.
Anyway, my Vah-Shir Bard (heavily-twinked) is lvl 25 and I know how to song twist and such. But, I am confused on what swarm kiting is, AoE kiting, charm kiting. These are a bit confusing to me. Except for AoE Kiting, I have a lvl 47 druid and kite Walruses non-stop. So....could someone explain what and how to do all these Bard Kites. Also, DDD and Cod, do very little damage, I'm guessing that these kites last a while.

Thank you

AoE Kiting:

Well, AoE kiting is out now that Sony has recently nerfed all bard AE songs. The nerf is simple, if the mob is moving, the damage from the AE does not take effect, rendering all AE damage songs useless for kiting.

Drum Kiting:

This is the most basic (and easiest) kite style. Basically, you load up your 4 best single-target Percussion-based DoT songs, load up your best Selos, and equip your drum.

You hit Selos, target a mob, and begin twisting your drum-DoTs. Run around in a wide circle with the mob chasing you, continuing to twist your single-target DoTs and remember to keep Selos up.

This style becomes even easier at level 49, when you get the 2-minute version of Selos, so you dont have to twist it in near as much and can concentrate on twisting DoTs.

Charm-Kiting
This is not quite as much Xp as swarm-kiting, but is faster than Drum-kiting and is easier/safer than swarm kiting. This method works best after level 39, when you get a 1-minute duration charm (as opposed to the older 18-second charm).

Load up your 4 best Percussion DoTs, Selos, a snare song, and your best charm song. Find a mob and charm it.

Find a second mob, and have your pet attack it while you DoT the mob. If at any time the mob starts chasing you instead of attacking your pet, twist in the snare so your pet can easily keep up and beat on the mob's rear end (also known as aggro-kiting). Re-charm your pet as needed.

If your pet is less than 50% health after a battle, locate a fresh mob, break charm, and charm the fresh mob. Have your new pet attack the old one.

Rinse and repeat. This method works great in zones where mobs are too sparse or spread out too far to effectively swarm kite.

Swarm-Kiting

This style is similar to Charm-kiting, but with more mobs and using your best charm song. Load up your percussion-based DoTs, load Selos, your best charm song, a snare, and either load your invis song or a clicky-item.

Hit selos, and aggro a bunch of mobs. Target one and charm it, then have it attack one of the other mobs. The other mobs should turn to attack your pet while you keep your distance. 

With multiple mobs hitting your pet, your pet's hps will drop MUCH faster than what you can do with DoTs alone. Just as the pet reaches about 20%, invis to break the charm. Select a fresh mob and charm it, then have it attack and kill your old pet, while you DoT your old pet for more dps. The other mobs should attack your new pet.

Rinse and repeat until the mobs are dead, then go grab more! This method is very mana-intensive, and works best if you have FT items to help regen the mana consumed from the charm song.

The nice thing is you can always switch to Drum-Kiting when your mana gets too low for swarm-kiting.
