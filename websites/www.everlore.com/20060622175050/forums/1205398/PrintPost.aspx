I've had the displeasure of grouping with two dishonorable Master Looters - Rudan and Sukulik.

Sukulik faked a Link Death (hmm, I wonder what type of software he is using on his computer to be able to do that!) and then stayed hidden from all attemptes to to find him with /who or /tell.  I finally found him doing ports for money.  When I confronted him about the money due, he just took a rider and ported away.

Rudan just up and left the group, after promising from the start he was going to share the loot.  During the fighting, when items came up that others in the group could use, he would loot them and not distribute them. In the end, although the group requested he split the loot, he just dropped out of the group (he was group leader) and vanished, just like Sukulik did.

These are two people that I will personally never group with again, and I give their names here in warning to everyone so nobody else will be ripped off by them.

If anyone else has a bad master looter list, please add to this post.  I'd like to know who to avoid.

Bad players is a different story - although they can be fatal, you have to remember that this IS a roleplaying game - I personally like to tank critters although I am a mage...

Stealing from me and others on the other hand, I do not like - especially when you are a non-twink.  I know how a lot of these twinks are getting their money now - just like Sukulik and Rudan are - by ripping hard working people off.  It is time to become united and put a stop to this!

"I know how a lot of these twinks are getting their money now - just like Sukulik and Rudan are - by ripping hard working people off. It is time to become united and put a stop to this!"

While I did read you're entire post, the paragraph posted above is not completely true, and is quite stereotypical.  I am a twink.  Though, I didn't get my stuff from ripping people off.  

I quit EQ for like 7 months, and came back and used money from a &lt;&lt;&lt;mule&gt;&gt;&gt; That I had before I quit.  

So on behalf of all twinks on the server, thanks for not including us in that paragraph.

I do understand that you posted this to get attention about them stealing from you, and I understand that, but you need to be more careful about how you say some things.  

Thanks, 
Zuukk/Thisyl
