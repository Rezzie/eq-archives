Author:  Millikin Erreene (pseudonym)

Part I


"Did you learn anything from that crystal?" 

Valdayana D`Varr's attention shifted to the Feir`Dal ranger who had silently entered her library. The ranger reached over for the amythest half buried under the scrolls the enchanter was perusing. It had been well over a year since she had last seen the ranger in person. Or had it? Valdayana sensed the inherent power that the ranger had acquired in her planes-hopping activities of late. Her equipment had also changed to reflect the demands placed on her by those whom she currently threw in her lot. Some things, however, did not change. The ranger remained aloof, unapproachable by most. There was something else though about the ranger's bearing that seemed... unsettling. 

"What is that ugly mask you're wearing?" Valdayana inquired seemingly ignoring the ranger's question.

"You like it? I got it from Rallos Zek himself. It's magical. I feel more... daring when I wear it."

"You dare much to presume to enter my home with an item bearing that sort of enchantment." Valdayana sniffed. "Take it off."

"Why?" Millikin reached up to remove the visor.

"The enchantment on that mask is designed to intimidate your opponents and I find it distracting."

"Really?" A sly grin crossed the ranger's face. "How distracting?"

"What happened to you the last time you attempted to try my patience, ranger?" Valdayana's innocent expression underscored the enchanter's barely concealed threat.

"You're in a foul mood this evening." Millikin slipped the visor into her belt.

"I am beyond such trivial emotional reactions. And I do not have time for your childish antics." Valdayana replied.

"Time. A nonspatial continuum in which events occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future." Millikin remarked flippantly.

"Your impertinence is only overshadowed by your ignorance." Valdayana commented offhandedly.

"Just as your intellect is obfuscated by your arrogance." Millikin smirked at Valdayana, still keeping hold of the amythest while pacing around the library. "Why did you send for me if not to inform me of something?"

"You said you wanted to discuss something with me that was too important to do through the usual correspondance." Valdayana waved the ranger to sit in the chair on the other side of her desk. Millikin ignored the gesture but stopped pacing. 

"I did. And so I'll ask now. What is a quintessence of the elements?"

"From an alchemical or philosophical standpoint, ranger?"

"What's the difference?" Millikin turned away, her attention momentarily drawn to the stuffed jackalope she had once inquired about and since forgotten. Valdayana raised an inquiring eyebrow at the ranger's reaction, getting the distinct impression that she wasn't telling her everything.

"If Saldaria's using you to wheedle information from me for her alchemical dabblings you can tell her to ask me herself."

"As far as I know, Saldaria knows nothing of this." Millikin responded carefully.

"How is the shaman doing?" Valdayana asked as she casually moved forward, hoping to fish out details of any falling out, if indeed there was one.

"I wouldn't know. When she wants something, she'll find me." Millikin shrugged. "Just like everyone else does." 

"Do I detect the bitter realization that your friendship means very little to someone who's lifespan doesn't hold a candle to yours and who has interests that are divergant from your own?" Valdayana queried.

"Are you going to answer my question or not?" 

Valdayana smiled despite herself, once her comment would have thrown the Feir`Dal completely off tangent and provoked her to anger. "One is a substance in it's purest state, the other a combination of the four elements into a new and separate form." She leaned back once more.

"That sounds contradictory."

"Unless you have an understanding of the major concepts of alchemy or philosophy, it would." Suddenly the realization struck the enchanter. The final component she needed to achieve immortality. No longer was it an unknown variable.

"I was entrusted with something. But I wasn't told the reason or what to do. And I wonder if you know something and didn't tell me."

"I know a lot of things and have not told you. You need to be more specific than that." Valdayana responded.

"These runes on my arm are in the Divine Language." Millikin pushed up the sleeve of her tunic.

"They enable you to traverse the elemental planes." Valdayana nodded. "I told you that already."

"I can also read and understand it." Millikin added, sliding her sleeve down.

"Are you going to come to the point anytime soon, Ranger?" Valdayana crossed her arms and waited expectantly.

"I guess it depends on you." Millikin took a packet of notes out from her tunic pocket and dropped them on the desk in front of Valdayana. "What do you make of this?"

Part 2


"Fire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, earth that of water.'' -- Heraclitis

Valdayana took the notes and scanned through them briefly. 

"They appear to be the schematics for a series of seige machines and a tactical outline for an invasion." She handed them back to the ranger, who finally decided to sit down.

"Why would the gods go to such lengths?"

"If memory serves, the House of Zek never need provocation. Warfare alone is reason enough." 

"Remember when you first mentioned Zebuxoruk to me?" Millikin absently began to tap her fingers on the arm of her chair. Valdayana silently watched the ranger's twitching as she vaguely recalled the conversation. Millikin was never good at concealing her anxiety, though it rarely manifested as bouts of anger any longer. Nonetheless, the enchanter was still tempted on occasion to test how well the ranger had learned to refocus that energy.

"Yes." The Teir` Dal nodded after a moment's deliberation.

"He is currently imprisoned by the panthenon. The sage in the cells of Justice was right."

"That is not my concern." Valdayana shrugged.

"But it doesn't make sense. Why imprison him instead of killing him outright if he's a threat."

"For the same reason Kerafyrm was not." Valdayana answered. "They aren't powerful enough."

"Surely he had help though. Just like I was given the ability to travel to the outer realms."

"True to an extent. You were tested and found fit to be granted that power."

"Why?" 

"Without knowing the extent of what you were given, I can't venture to say for certain. But in all probability it is another test of sorts. Or a trap."

"What do you mean a trap?" Millikin's eyes narrowed at the implication.

"Consider what you learned, Ranger. The gods of Norrath seek the destruction of mortals. Or at the very least, ensure mortals remain under their control." 

"Some of them." Millikin nodded.

"If they can't obtain that by overt brute force they will resort to subversion." Valdayana continued. "They could be testing to see if anyone they can control may be powerful enough to eliminate any threats to their supremacy. Or simply giving those who may challenge their divinity just enough assistance to get into a situation that inevitably results in their destruction." 

"Like letting a child play with a sword." 

"An apt analogy." Valdayana remarked. 

"I saw them die... They died and imbued me with a portion of their essence."

"Who?" Valdayana asked.

"The elder gods. Xegony, the Rathe Council, Fennin Ro, and the Coirnav of the Triumvirate of Water." Millikin whispered.

"What are you talking about?' Valdayana peered at the ranger. With the substance of her ages-long search finally within her means and likely in the possession of the Feir` Dal standing before her, Valdayana D`Varr was remarkably self-possessed.

"I encountered the elemental gods in their home planes. When they died, they imbued a part of themself within me as well as leaving a remnant behind. At times I felt it pulling at me. Shifting, I don't know really. I can't explain it. You used this to find specific memories." Millikin held up the memory crystal. "Could you do something similiar to find out what it is they put within me. And possibly remove it."

"Do you realize what you're asking me to do, Ranger?" To be sure, the irony was not lost on Valdayana D` Varr.

"I'm asking for your help to extricate myself from the control of beings who would just as soon see us all exterminated. I have seen no intercession on our behalf by the gods supposedly concerned for our welfare." Millikin answered solemnly. 

"Do you have the fragments left behind by the gods?" 

"Yes." Millikin nodded.

"Then I will see what I can do."

Part 3

"Here we belong, fighting for survival.  We've come to be the rulers of you all."  -- Freddie Mercury


Valdayana D`Varr placed her hand on the ranger's forehead and chanted an arcane incantation.  Suddenly she felt a searing heat course through her body.  She saw through the ranger's eyes the events that transpired.


The Burning Lands of Doomfire. (Plane of Fire)

"So you are to be a vessel for my power?  Fennin Ro's challenge echoed through the ranger's thoughts, a seeming impossibility since his corporeal form was lying in a heap on the ground.  

"Take the dancing flame.  In time you will be called upon to prevent a headlong charge into the total oblivion of reality."

Confused, Millikin looked around.  "What?..."  She looked around, half expecting to see the fiery countenance of the god of fire.  But through the haze borne of perpetual flame and lava, Millikin's gaze focused on Elyda.  The fair haired Feir`Dal druid was making her way towards the ranger.  The two wood elves seemed similiar to each other at first glance.  Both wore armor that resembled a mix of chain and leather and both served Tunare on a level that transcended 
divine levels and delved into the natural order of existence.  But where Millikin relied primarily on her physical prowess as her source of power and used magic secondarily, Elyda was more attuned towards matters mystical and personally shunned the marital aspects of combat as a druid.  On the field of battle, Elyda was often seen wielding a scimitar, allegedly blessed by the god Mithaniel Marr himself, but her cheerful demeanor seemed ill-suited to commanding an organized force into open combat against an elemental god.  However, appearances could be deceiving and the fact that Fennin Ro's body was currently smoldering before his very throne was stark testament to the druid's leadership abilities.

"Here."  Elyda tossed a small dark object towards the ranger who reflexively reached up to catch it with her left hand.  Millikin looked down at the object in her hand.  A small translucent orb contained a small fire flickered within its glassy housing.  She could feel the heat emanating within the globe.  Millikin looked up quizzically at the druid.

"The elemental who left them said we will need them later."  Elyda explained.  "And one of the elders in Knowledge said he could help if we gather the essences of the gods together."

Millikin nodded slightly, still remembering what she had just heard.

Part 4


Eryslai, The Kingdom of Wind (Plane of Air)

Millikin strolled through one of the corridors of Xegony's domain towards a library.  She had approached the goddess' inner sanctum and was turned away by Muzlakh, the gatekeeper of the goddess' inner sanctum.

"Be gone from here, mortal.  The fact that you serve Tunare means precious little here, so long as your kind continue to walk where they are neither wanted nor welcome."  The stormrider, a giant birdlike creatures with bee wings, hovered several feet in the air and scowled at the wood elf ranger.  But Millikin was not to be deterred so easily.  

"I have some questions."

"Then consult her chosen avatars of wind, dust, smoke, and mist."  Muzlakh replied.  "They are the ones appointed to determine if a mortal should be worthy of entering Xegony's presence.

"How do you think I got here in the first place?"  Millikin remarked.  Her patience was wearing thin.  She had spent weeks on end wandering the libraries and conversing with the various djinn, stormriders, and nilborien.  All of them claimed they had no idea of the globe's purpose that she had obtained from Fennin Ro's servant.  

"They said catastrophic events have been set in motion that may be my undoing."

"Then perhaps you should heed their warning, Feir`Dal."  Muzlakh growled.  

"Not until I find out what the globe of dancing flame is for."  Millikin answered.  The stormrider's eyes narrowed to slits.  "Stay here."   The stormrider turned and flew towards Xegony's assembly, and returned moments later, a book in hand.

"Read this and return it to any of the libraries here, mortal.  Do not leave this realm with that text in your possession."  The stormrider held out the book disdainfully towards the ranger.

"Thank you."  Millikin took the offered book.  There was no title on the cover.

"Now be gone from my sight."

Millikin turned and headed towards one of the libraries.  What she ended up reading she found quite unsettling.  She knew the story of Rallos Zek's attempt to murder the Rathe Council and his failure to do so was because as soon as one would fall another would rise up to take the place of the fallen.  The book detailed the precise reasons for Rallos' bid for power.  

The elemental gods had created a substance called the quintessence of the elements that enabled the user to alter time itself.   They had kept it hidden from the other gods in the care of the Rathe Council but somehow Rallos had learned of its existence and demanded they hand it over.  Obviously the elder gods refused, so Rallos Zek decided he would take it by force.  Once Rallos Zek was repelled and his followers were decimated by the panthenon, the elemental gods stated they would destroy the quintessence of the elements to prevent the possibility of Rallos Zek or another like minded individual would attempt to take it and abuse its power.  Xegony, the Triumvirate of Water, the Rathe Council, and Fennin Ro dismantled the quintessence and took back the portion of themself they contributed to its creation.  But the knowledge of how to create it was kept in tact.

Millikin stared down at the book in disbelief.  While she had been forbidden to leave with the book, nothing prevented her from copying its contents.  And so she copied down what she had just read into her journal before departing Eryslai, determined to return later once the information she had learned was kept safe.  

The deity of air was one of the most reclusive gods in the entire panthenon and so her entire assembly was none too pleased to see a wood elf shove past Muzlakh the Chosen and run straight towards their goddess' throne.  Several suits of armor that were gifted with the breath of life from Xegony drew their weapons and moved towards the intruder.  The elder goddess glanced in the direction of the disturbance.  Her minions were having some difficulty in apprehending the ranger who had abruptly ran in another direction, when she sensed the presence of others nearby.  She sighed inwardly and decided to bring this chase to an abrupt halt.  Tiny sylphs surrounded the ranger and she felt herself slowing down as a whirlwind engulfed her and she quickly found breathing impossible.  The ranger blacked out moments later.  Nuquernal Belegrodian, one of the elder djinn of Xegony's court, drew his dagger and moved to drive it through the ranger's back.

"Hold.  This ranger is here for a different purpose."  

"My Queen, she came with the others who are gathering for an assault."  Nuquernal slid the dagger back into his sash.  "Do you honestly think this one is any different from the other mortals?"

"We will soon find out."  

A castellan dragged the unconscious ranger across the field and dropped her on the ground a few feet in front of Xegony before returning to his post.  Millikin eventually stirred and pushed herself up to a sitting position trying to shrug aside the dizziness she was experiencing.  The sensation quickly faded away when she looked up to face the the unblinking gaze of Xegony.

"Millikin Erreene.  Why are you here?"

"How do you know who I am?  Millikin was startled.  Never before had any of Norrath's pantheon members known who she was, a thought she considered strange from ones who claimed near onmiscence.  "Never mind.  It's a stupid question."

"You are one of Tunare's adherents." It was more a statement than a question but the context was lost on the ranger.

"I don't know anymore.  It seems as if I don't exist as far as anyone is concerned."

"You are real enough.  Why are you here, Ranger?"  

"Why was I given this?"  Millikin reached for the medicine pouch worn around her neck and extracted the globe of dancing flame.  She held it up to Xegony.

"Fennin considered you worthy did he?"

"Worthy of what?"  Millikin's hand closed around the globe and she placed it back in her pouch.

"And you have displayed a remarkable level of determination and patience to reach me.  You will need this as well."  Millikin cautiously moved forward to see what the elemental god offered.  In the palm of her hand was a small white cloudlike object.  When she reached to touch it, her finger passed harmlessly through it.

"Just think about it in your hand."  Millikin glanced skeptically at the goddess then looked down to her hand.  Suddenly the tiny cloud appeared in her hand.  She glanced up to see Xegony was no longer holding the object.

"But what is it for?"

"The Quintessence is for time."  Xegony answered.  "Seek out the Rathe Council and the Triumvirate to complete it."

Part 5


At that moment, Valdayana distanced herself from the mental link with the ranger.  There was always a danger in losing one's own sense of self when experiencing another's memories, and even moreso due to the fact that the ranger's memories of the incident had not faded with the passage of time.  The enchanter decided to shift her concentration on the link to take the role of third party observer.  She watched the events unfold once more in the ranger's mind.  


Vegarlson, the Earthen Badlands  (The Plane of Earth)

To say that mortals were unwelcome in the elemental planes would be a vast understatement.  Valdayana watched as the ranger was attacked by denizens of the plane.  In a series of rituals demonstrating strength and endurance, the ranger and her companions drew the attention of the Mystical Arbitor of Earth who summoned them beneath the caves past the gigantic basilisk that stood as the sentinel to crystal caves that led to the Rathe Council's sanctum.  The earth elemental was created to arbitrate demands by the lesser gods and their demi-divine subordinates seeking audience with the Rathe Council.  It was somewhat suprised to see a group of mortals petitioning entry into Ragrax.  This was unheard of.  Mortals were not to be permitted access to the elemental planes and were to be summarily destroyed if they were found.  Invariably, the arbitor found itself crumbling into pebbles before the onslaught.  Its essense dispersed itself upon the assemblage, allowing them to pass through the mystical barriers that protected the Rathe Council's fortress.


Ragrax, the Stronghold of the Twelve, (The Plane of Earth)

Ragrax was a fortress manned by golems constructed of dirt and mud, vekerchiki, slightly more powerful versions of an earth mephit, and moss covered humanoids possessing shamantic powers.  The defense was overseen by a contingent of stone giants led by an elder giant warlord named Gintolakan.  It was a simple matter of bypassing or destroying the golems, mephits, and humanoids.  The giants were another matter.  Their defensive outline required intruders to conquer the fortress in sections.  Three watchposts formed a mystical barrier manned by several giants and commanded by a chieftain.  One pylon must be seized by potential invaders before moving to the next one.  Usually by the time the third pylon is taken, Warlord Gintolakan is alerted and arrives to challenge any who dare to attempt to breech the Rathe's inner sanctum.  Warlord Gintolakan had been blessed by the Rathe with the ability to command pebbles and dust to slow opponents as well as summon a comet to strike at his foes with bone shattering force.  But for all his formidable strength, it did not take the ranger and her companions long to realize that he was easily distracted.  Perhaps he could not see well, between the perpetual dust and comparative differences in size, or perhaps he was just slow witted.  In any event the giant was eventually slain, the key granting him access to the Rathe's inner sanctum was claimed.

The Rathe were assembled in a grove of petrified trees surrounded by a river of muddy water.  Each looked identical to the other.  A giant piece of wood with features were carved with a knife.  Their only adornments were a toga made of moss and grass and each one carried a large gnarled staff.  The ranger cautiously approached the council who were seemingly oblivious to her presence then suddenly all of them turned to face her.

"You trespass here."  They spoke in unison.

"I seek your counsel."  Millikin responded.

"Transient mortal issues do not concern us." 

"You are the ones who are to help me complete the Quintessence of the Elements."  

"Why would we do this?"

"That's what I want to know."  The ranger replied.  "What is it for?"

"It gives the bearer access to time."  The Rathe Council answered.  "But you suspect this already.  Some mortals seek to disrupt the balance of power between mortality and divinity. You will act to prevent this.  Our avatar will give you what you require."

One by one the Rathe fell to the ground, their life's blood mingled with the dirt and stone of their homeland.  The ground shook and in the center of the grove, a single entity emerged from the ground, a singular councilman rose up, much taller than the predecessors.  The Rathe's avatar began to chant as it reached down to scoop up a handful of dirt at its feet.  Primal energy surged in its hand as it closed around the earth, turning it black.  Then the avatar opened its hand and dropped the sphere onto the ground at Millikin's feet.

Part 6


The Reef of Coirnav  (The Plane of Water)

The ranger's thoughts as to her foray into the Triumvirate of Water's realm were a chaotic jumble for the enchanter.  Unlike the other planes, Millikin never actually encountered E`ci, Povar, or Tarew Marr face to face.  They chose to speak through a singular proxy, an enormous kracken revered by the plane's denizens as Coirnav.  He refused to speak with mortals under any circumstances and sent swarms of crab-men called regrua, a wide assortment of aquatic animals, and elemental creatures called slarghilugs as well as water mephits to summarily slay any non-native.  When the leaders of each race were slain, Coirnav himself appeared and attempted to forcibly expel the unwanted visitors via magic when he failed and fell before the assault of the planar raiders, his spirit drifted away in the currents and momentarily engulfed the ranger.  Suddenly the waters chilled and left behind tiny chunks of ice.  Millikin took hold of the ice and abruptly felt herself shifted to the Plane of Tranquility.

Part 7

"No one knows what power is locked inside another; no one knows what power is locked within oneself" -- Anne Rice Queen of the Damned

 

"So that's how you got these?"  Valdayana abruptly terminated the mental link she held with the ranger and indicated the objects Millikin had set out on the desk earlier. The ranger snapped back to full consciousness. She felt dizzy and did not respond immediately. Valdayana D`Varr studied the ranger intently for several minutes. Centuries of magical study had enabled the enchanter to effortlessly detect magical auras around places, people, and objects. There was clearly a magical aura surrounding the ranger that extended well beyond the typical protections the ranger employed. They did not invoke any form of magic employed by any mortal practitioner. It was also clear to the enchanter that this dweomer was linked to the ranger's life force.  She smiled inwardly at such a predictable safeguard and idly wondered if the gods had contemplated that the ranger's life would be considered an acceptable loss for the power to be gained.  But then who were they to presume to try and take what was hers by all rights?

"Ranger?" Valdayana poked the ranger.

"Yes?"

"This will not be a particularly easy or pleasant process. I can remove the ensorcelment they placed on you but I'll need a place to store the residual magics."  Valdayana neglected to mention the fact that it would entail removing the ranger's very life essence. "In fact I may need the assistance of a necromancer."

"Why?" Immediately Millikin's eyes narrowed. She suspected she knew who Valdayana already had in mind. 

"I told you this will not be easy." 

"I despise the very air Elegy breathes."

"As a disciple of Innoruuk, I'm sure she'd be pleased to know that she inspires such a reaction from you. Take solace in the fact that she is not particularly fond of you either."

"What could she possibly do that you cannot do yourself?"  Millikin asked suspiciously.

"I wish to take precautions to avoid any fatal accidents." Valdayana answered cautiously.

"So I have no choice in the matter?" 

"Not if you want my help." 

"Fine then." Millikin grudgingly conceded.

_____

"What do I owe for the privilege of your presence, Deanna?" Elegy looked up from a circle of ashes, blood, and scattered bones she had drawn around a pile of deadwood.

"I need to kill my ranger." Valdayana replied. 

"So, your pale skinned plaything has outlived its usefulness. What fortunate turn of events has brought about this decision?" A twisted grin crossed Elegy's face. "Do you tire of playing mind tricks on it?

"It serves me well enough." Valdayana shrugged. "But for now, I need her death to be slow."

"You are discarding efficiency for personal desires."

"Pragmatism requires that the ranger live long enough to complete my experiment. And possibly be restored to life later should the process not work."

"A pity. Well, hopefully you will be successful in your first attempt."  The Teir`Dal necromancer's attention focused once again upon the conjuring circle she had created.

"Your free-willed cat's paw has obviously caused you a share of annoyances on its own."

"It is a fair trade off for the effort expended." Valdayana shrugged as she examined the circle more closely and noticed the slaughtered goats and chickens. "You are summoning Ghede?" The question from the enchanter was really more of a statement.

"So my time teaching you wasn't a total waste. There is much to learn from the dead."  Elegy looked pointedly back to Valdayana.

"And more still from the living."

"Yet you are here, seeking a means to glean power from death." Elegy smirked.

"True enough. What do you suggest?" 

"Bleed it." Elegy responded.

"That's not practical." 

"On the contrary, bleeding will give you much more control on how quickly it dies. Cut out an internal body part or sever a limb and it will die quickly."

"As I said, I may need to restore her to life. Somewhat difficult if she's missing functional organs."  Valdayana commented dryly.

"Drain the blood steadily from a single puncture or cut to a vein in its wrist or near the inner elbow. It's strength will ebb away and it will fall unconscious shortly before its life expires. It will take minutes or hours depending on the precautions to slow the bleeding. Bring me the blood you spill and I shall restore it to life should you require." Elegy spoke finally. Valdayana nodded silently. 

"I know that it would despise being beholden to me for resurrecting it. And that thought gives me more satisfaction than any physical pain I could inflict upon it. How is that for irony?"

"I do believe you're developing an appreciation for mental distress."  Valdayana replied.

Part 8

Valdayana looked impassively at Millikin who was slumped in the chair, dead.  Elegy's prediction that the ranger's death would occur as slowly as necessary via controlled bleeding was correct.  Her blood ran in a steady trickle through a tube down to a rune engraved bowl.  She had turned a sickly white before falling unconscious.  As she bled, so too did the primal elemental energies that had been imbedded into her soul, drawn as if magnetized to a shadowy orb the enchanter had created.  At the moment of death there was a sudden surge of eldritch power as the remaining energies shifted to find purchase.  When it was complete Valdayana picked up the small orb.  Inside one could see a fire burning underwater and motes of air scattering dirt.

"Now this is a quintessence of the elements, Ranger."  Valdayana remarked, though Millikin was far beyond hearing.  She crushed the globe in her hand and felt a surge of energy race into her hand and through her body.  

"I didn't quite expect.... this."  The enchanter felt the elemental energies merging with her essense.  The searing heat of fire burned throughout only to be quenched by the chill of water, then the sudden pressure of stone weighed on her as she fell over, breathing became difficult and then she couldn't and then she was swept away by a gale.  And then Valdayana D`Varr died.

Death is not quite an accurate word though.  The elemental forces the enchanter had seized held the enchanter's spirit and kept it from dissipating.  The quintessence did not just grant permanent immortality to the enchanter but an understanding of the necessity of balance between order and chaos.  She glimpsed the forces of chaos that forever pushed and attempted to destroy the barriers that defined reality.  Balance was eroding on Norrath, and not just between the gods versus mortals but amongst the mortal population on the most fundamental levels of society.  Valdayana D`Varr willed herself back to her mortal form.

"So, that is what you were trying to tell me.  Your intellectual capacity was never as good as your perceptions though."  She poked the ranger's body.  Slowly the body began to warm as the ranger's spirit was recalled by the enchanter.  Millikin jerked forward as she returned to life and kicked over the bowl that contained her blood.

"Sorry."  Millikin frowned as Valdayana gave the ranger a look of mild annoyance.  She half knelt to pick up the bowl and saw the blood that had pooled on the floor.  Out of morbid curiosity, the wood elf ranger traced her first finger through it.

"All of this was mine?"  She blinked in surprise.

"Well it certainly isn't mine."  Valdayana answered.

"I'm surprised I didn't die from blood loss."  Millikin remarked offhandedly.

"You did die."  The enchanter responded.  

"You mean to say you killed me??!"  The ranger started in shock.

"And I brought you back."  Valdayana answered coolly.  "You said to do what was necessary."

"It was necessary to kill me?!?"

"No, I did it because I had absolutely nothing better to do with my time and thought that killing you then reviving you to let you kick your blood all over my clean floor would be an entertaining way to spend an evening."  Valdayana's sarcastic remark drew a silent glare from Millikin that the enchanter met with her own dispassionate gaze.

"Do you want to know what happened or are you going to continue sulking?"

"What?"  Millikin asked.  "Besides the fact that you killed me."

"That's a trivial detail."  Valdayana remarked.  "In any event, my process was a success and I removed the energies the gods placed in you and absorbed it into myself.  That's why I had to kill you, I could only draw it from your life essense as it was leaving the mortal plane, so to speak.  I decided to absorb it myself since it needs another sentient life force to sustain itself."

"What did you do that for?"  Millikin interrupted.  

"To increase my own power of course and find out what they were planning."  Valdayana answered before continuing.  "They intended to ensure no mortal achieves divinity without their collective agreement.  And they failed.  They're also neglecting other more important matters.  Hence why I brought you back."

"So now you're a cleric?"  Millikin scoffed.

"Were you not paying attention to anything I said to you?"  Valdayana peered intently at the wood elf.

"I'm sorry.  My attention was diverted at the point where you said you killed me."

"Verbatim, I never said that.  I said 'you did die'.  Valdayana paused before adding.  "Tell me, is that all you heard?"

"The meaning is the same."  Outwardly, Millikin remained calm but her eyes reflected a smoldering anger as she regarded the enchanter and paused to recall what was said, trying to stay composed.  "You made a comment about bringing me back and that killing me was necessary and a sarcastic remark about spilling my blood on your floor."  She paused.  "Then there was your pompous speech about absorbing the magical energies and it needing a sentient being to sustain itself."

"Pompous?  This is how you address me after I put myself at risk to help you."

"Spare me the acrimony, Valdayana.  You used my misfortune to your benefit.  As usual."

"True.  It was regrettable but necessary, Millikin.  Now as for..."  Valdayana replied and was interrupted.

"Wait.  Did you say regrettable?  Is this an apology?"  Millikin interrupted.

"I never apologize for my actions."  Valdayana looked askant at the ranger.

"But you just said it was regrettable."  Millikin countered.  "And you actually used my first name."

"May I continue?"  Valdayana inquired, deliberately ignoring the ranger's previous comment.

"Sorry.  Go ahead."  Millikin answered.

"As I was saying, the reason they granted you this boon is they want you to enter a node where an individual can alter time itself.  And you don't want to disappoint them now do you?

"What are you thinking?"  Millikin's eyes narrowed, not entirely sure she was going to like what she was about to hear.

Part 9

You Can't Go Home Again

"When did you get taller, Dahlia?"  Millikin looked at the silver haired girl who was nearly eye level to her.

"While you were off wandering around.  You seem different too."  She beamed at the ranger before hugging her.  "Your last letter said you went to that new continent the bards are talking about."

Millikin returned the hug and nodded.  Taelosia, it is not a pleasant place.

"It can't be worse than Terris' realm can it?  And you never finished telling me what happened after the Plane of Water."  

"I didn't?"  Millikin got a vague expression on her face at the reference.

"No.  You didn't."

"Check again."  Millikin replied.  

"I keep everything you send me and it's not there."  Dahlia rolled her eyes.  "Does it have something to do with that dark elf you associate with.  What happened?"  

"It's a rather long story."

"We have time.  Mother and Father went to Felwithe for the day." 

"Since nothing else will please you."

Millikin recounted the events to her sister as they walked along the treetop platforms of Kelethin.  

"What did the quarm look like?"

"You've seen a picture of a hydra monster, yes?"

Dahlia nodded.

"Well... He had four dragon-like heads.  Each one a different color, red, green, black, and bluish white.  His body was a deep green color.  And he had long batlike wings.  But I don't think he could fly with them.  He's too big."

"How big was he?"

"He could easily look over the platforms while standing on the ground."

"Where did it come from?"  

"Mostly, the elemental gods summoned it to guard Zebuxoruk."  Millikin explained before going into detail about how they eventually slew it. 

"Pay your tribute here!  And perhaps the gods will turn their attention to us once more!"  

The statement immediately caught the ranger's attention.

"What's this?"

"That's one of the things that's changed recently."  Dahlia whispered.  "Mother says the elders say Tunare is silent."

"And who is this person?"  Millikin asked.

"Katryn Hidken.  A tribute master.  They can grant spells or something."  Dahlia explained.

"A what?!"  Millikin stormed up to the table where a handful of elves had gathered.

"What are you doing here?"  The ranger demanded of the woman who was taking money and items from a few younger elves who had gathered.

"You must have been away for awhile."  Katryn began.  "As some of the greedy people invaded the realms of our gods, the pantheon has decided to withdraw their blessings from mortals.  However, if proper penance and offerings are provided, Tunare will provide supplicants with...."

"Money.  So now the gods demand money from us as well?"  The ranger clenched her fists and tried to keep the anger out of her voice.

"Not necessarily money.  Other goods of value can be given as a sacrifice as well.  Do you wish to make a donation as well?  It's the only way to obtain Tunare's blessing."

Millikin grabbed an end of the collection table and hurled it to the side, scattering the containers of platinum, gold, and plethora of food, weapons, and armor the tribute master had obtained.  "She can keep her blessings then."  

"Mill..."  Dahlia whispered in horrified surprise.

"How dare you!"  Katryn glared daggers at the ranger.  "It's attitudes like yours that have caused the gods to withdraw their favor from us in the first place."

"My behavior.  You don't have any idea of what you're talking about."  Millikin gave the tribute master a look of utter contempt.

"Its no secret that bands of power mongering mercenaries have trampled through the gods' realm visiting destruction on their servants and plundering."

"Then of course you are also aware that while several gods of the panthenon were plotting the genocide of every race on Norrath, the rest of them decided to sit quietly back and not interfere in the slightest.  If it wasn't for the actions of those power mongering mercenaries, the entirety of Norrath would have been reduced to ash.  And you have the audacity to tell people they should pay the gods for their continued intercession?"

"You lie."  The tribute master sneered at Millikin.

"Do I?"  Millikin countered.  "Then why don't the gods strike me down for heresy?  You're wasting your time trying to gain the approval of a god who cares nothing about our fate.  You don't even have the slightest conception of what's waiting on the edge of this world because of their petty power plays."

"Be gone."  Katryn waved a dismissive hand at Millikin and bent down to pick up the scattered coins.

"Millikin..."  Dahlia tugged at the ranger's arm.  "Let's go."  The two walked off.

"And you say nothing interesting ever happens to you."  Dahlia grinned at Millikin.

Millikin told Dahlia everything that happened that evening.  The entire story of her battle with Quarm.  How her life force was torn from her body by the elder gods to complete their conjuration and left her where she fell.  Knowing they would be weakened in their collective attempt to imprison Zebuxoruk, they elemental powers stored part of their essence to recall it again later for a trap to kill any mortals who would question their decision.  Their plan was flawed in that they did not consider the machinations of a Teir` Dal enchanter's bid for divinity.  Valdayana D`Varr had seized the power they had placed in Millikin for her own and survived the apotheosis such an act would trigger.  

That night as the ranger fell into the elven reverie, she recalled the panthenon's reaction to Valdayana's ascension and grudging acceptance...

Part 10

Convocation

"Get up."  

Millikin sat up, still somewhat dazed.  The last thing she remembered was fighting the hydra named Quarm that was summoned by the elemental gods.

"You're barely presentable."  Valdayana critically inspected the ranger.

"I had other activities take precedent."  Millikin brushed the flecks of black ice from her clothing.

"You're going to attend a convocation of sorts.  Just remain silent and listen."  Valdayana stated briskly as she pushed the ranger towards the door.

"What's this for?"  Millikin dug in her heels to stop herself from being pushed forward any further.

"You'll see soon enough."  Valdayana replied.

Suddenly everything began to fall away before Millikin's eyes and she found herself looking into a dusky haze.  Then the area turned into a large assembly hall.  Then the deities of the Norrathian panthenon arrived, each accompanied by a minion who was not quite mortal.  Some of them Millikin visibly recognized, others she had no idea of whom they were.

"I told you this would happen, Father."  Solusek Ro's gloating pronouncement held a glimmer of barely concealed accusation.

"No one refuted that it was a possibility.  The issue at hand is the details of how it came to be."  Fennin Ro responded.

"Who cares?"  Rallos Zek growled.  "We should destroy her here and now and be done with it."  The god of war stood up and reached for the war axe leaning on the table beside him.  Tallon Zek, who had shrewdly been appraising Valdayana D`Varr, spoke quietly.

"Father, perhaps we should hear Fennin out first."  Tallon advised.

"I concur.  It might be best so we can prevent this sort of thing in the future."  Vallon Zek echoed his brother's sentiments.

"You are afraid of this mere dark elf.  Stand aside, cowards."  Rallos shoved his sons aside and lifted his axe and lifted it intending to cleave the enchanter in two.  Valdayana whispered an arcane phrase and suddenly Rallos' strength drained from his body.  He stumbled back and dropped his axe unable to lift it.  The god of war gave Valdayana a look of seething hatred and Innoruuk's chilling laughter echoed in the hall.  The goddess of nightmares glanced knowingly at  her father, Cazic Thule, who nodded almost imperceptibly.

"So you can defend yourself from direct physical harm.  How is your mental stability?" Terris Thule gestured and tendrils of energy emerged from the ground and surrounded the dark elf enchanter searching for her innermost fears.  Suddenly the tendrils whiplashed back towards Terris, who's eyes widened in surprise as they disappeared.

"Quite stable."  Valdayana gazed impassively at the tall woman before turning to address the Seventh Hammer.  "Are these attempts at petty one-upmanship concluded?"  

"Well there is the question of how a new demi-god is so powerful."  Solusek Ro observed.

"She stole her power."  Bristlebane chimed in, grinning.

"Stolen?!"  The surprise of several gods was evident.

"Misplaced is a more accurate term."  Valdayana commented absently.

"Misplaced by whom?"  Mithaniel Marr inquired.

"It should be evident I think.  The elemental elders themselves."

"You lie."  Saryrn hissed.

"It's true."  Millikin interjected.  "They imbued their essence into me as part of your prison for Zebuxoruk."

"We reclaimed that power from you though."  Fennin Ro responded in surprise.

"Not all of it."  Valdayana answered.

"I demand to know what this Feir`Dal of yours has to do with all of this, Tunare."  Rallos Zek roared at the goddess of nature.  "She has been a perpetual thorn in my side since this entire fiasco started."  Tunare looked from Millikin to Rallos Zek to Xegony.

"It's not my place to say."

"Tunare abandoned her long ago."  Valdayana remarked.  "Isn't that true?"

Millikin's eyes widened in shock when there was no response forthcoming from the elven deity.

"It's okay to hate her, mortal."  Innoruuk gloated.  "I certainly do."

"If I abandoned her as you claim, then who granted her the ability to wield divine magic."

"Did you not gift your creations with the ability to attune themself to nature?"  Valdayana remarked dryly.  "You haven't bothered directly with the development of the lesser elves in eons.  You left them to their own fate and rarely meddled even while Tunaria burned."

"Astute observations, Valdayana D`Varr."  Saryrn uttered.  "It still doesn't answer the question as to how you achieved divinity."

"The ranger told you.  The elemental gods imbued some of their power into her and I took it for myself."  

"Impossible!"  Rallos Zek roared.  "They managed to summon Quarm!"

"Did you think I was stupid enough to take every ounce of power.  I left some of it so your machinations played out as you intended.  I'm not such a fool as to think godhood should be up for grabs to every sword swinging idiot or incompetent spellcaster that traipses through Norrath."  

"Why don't you just reclaim your powers from this upstart?"  Cazic Thule turned to face the elemental elder gods.

"We cannot."  The Rathe Council intoned.  "She took precautions to ensure they could not be taken from her using unknown magicks."

"She thought of everything."  Tallon Zek remarked offhandedly.

"You manipulated that ranger solely to acquire divinity."  Mithaniel Marr looked sharply at Valdayana D`Varr.

"Yes, and in the process I forwarded your plans to keep the collective mortals from gaining Zebuxoruk's knowledge."  Valdayana answered.  

"Not exactly the most honorable means to acquire an end."  Mithaniel remarked.

"Don't act like she wasn't already being manipulated by others.  When your compatriots were finished with her they left her to drift into oblivion."  Valdayana gazed coldly at the paladin god.

"The Tribunal is of the opinion that Valdayana D`Varr has earned her place among our ranks as a deity through the use of intrigue, manipulation, and acquired hidden lore.  She has broken no laws of universal balance and has acted to promote such."  The Seventh Hammer pronounced solemnly.

"So typical of the Tribunal."  Innoruuk remarked contemptuously.

"The debating raged back and forth for what seemed like hours.  The more pragmatic gods agreed that it would be better to have her amongst her ranks as opposed to running the risk of  a rogue power operating against them.  Eventually the convocation dispersed, taking their minions with them.

"Why did you take me to this?"  

"Because these convocations required a non-deific observer on behalf of each deity present."  Valdayana answered.  "And you needed to know where you stand amongst the pantheon."

"They don't care about anyone."

"We'll talk later when you aren't so angry."  

"I'm not angry..."  Millikin started but was suddenly left standing alone in the Greater Faydark.

"Through dangers untold
And hardships unnumbered,
I have fought my way here
To the castle beyond the goblin city
For my will is as strong as yours
And my kingdom as great
You have no power over me."   -- A. C. H. Smith  (The Labyrinth)


Several months later, Millikin stood on the shores of Natimbi.  She had ventured into sites once venerated by the Nihilites, a race that had since fallen to corruption and the invasion forces of an entity known as Mata`Muram.  She learned of the tragic fate of the Trusik, cursed to exist for an eternity as apparitions re-enacting the last moments of their lives just prior to their deaths.  Many of them did not even realize they were ghosts that would re-materialize later even if put to the sword or destroyed by eldritch power.  Repeated expeditions became an exercise in futility and on more than one occasion the rationale for exploring through the ruined shrines was for plundering whatever valuables could be found, not finding a way to stop Mata`Muram's forces.  Nor did any of these excursions entail freeing the living Nihilites from Muramite oppression.  Millikin found the practice personally distasteful and since the skills of a ranger are not desired or needed by other individuals belonging to her formal association, she was often dismissed from participating.  She found herself with an inordinate amount of free time on her hands to wander on her own and contemplate matters.  It was just as well since she disliked the attitudes of the current powerbase that dictated policy.  Their presumptuous arrogance and boasts of success were nothing more than thinly veiled attempts at slaking their own greedy self-interests.  The Feir`Dal ranger dismissed it as typical human behavior but was growing weary of having any involvement in it, even if her role was only peripheral at best.

For her own part, Millikin Erreene had all but verbally forsworn any devotion she once held for Tunare.  She would not bring herself to defend the derogatory slurs often thrown around by the lesser races about the elves' patron deity.  The ranger scoffed at the idea of one being so callously indifferent to their creations as deserving of such an acknowledgement in the first place.  In fact she ceased using the magic she could once call upon in the goddess' name.  Not that anyone really noticed since the gods had long ago spurned granting their militant followers spells more effective than anything they granted their significantly less skilled and experienced members of the priesthood.  The handful of spells Millikin did use derived their power directly from the forces of the four elements or aspects of nature instead.  She extracted a fishing line and bait from her backpack and decided to pursue some fishing.

"Ranger."  

Millikin recognized the voice and glanced around but didn't see anyone even though her senses had developed to the point where she could see or smell most beings that could employ magics to hide themselves from normal vision.  She resumed watching her fishing line.

"Have you gone deaf, Ranger?"

"My hearing is fine."

"You did not acknowledge me."  

"You aren't present to acknowledge, Luhtmauyar D`Varr."

"Believe it or not I have other things to do that actually require my physical presence."  

"You're showing off and I'm not impressed."  Millikin watched in mild amusement as a crab snipped her fishing line and scurried to shore with bait and lure in tow.  Moments later, light began to shimmer around the crab as it began to transform into the dark elven enchanter.  She held out the fishing wire, lure, and worm to Millikin with obvious disdain.

"Here is your toy, Ranger."

"Don't you have better things to do besides antagonize me?"  Millikin took the line from the enchanter and began to untangle the lure from the fishing wire.

"And forget the little people who helped me get where I am today?"  Valdayana remarked loftily.

"How magnanimous of you."  Millikin rolled her eyes.

"A four syllable word.  Did someone teach the Feir`Dal ranger how to read a dictionary?"  The dark elf's tone was not quite acerbic.

"Yes, a condescending Teir`Dal enchanter who was old when trakaraptors roamed the Commonlands."  Millikin pointedly ignored Valdayana's incisive gaze as she worked to unravel the hook from her fishing line.

"You aren't traipsing through the Nihilite temples with your friends."  Valdayana commented absently.

"Do not insult the handful of people I consider my friends by presuming my association with a guild also makes them my friends.  They don't qualify and in fact many of them despise me.  But so long as I have some measurable worth to them they'll tolerate me.”  Millikin paused deliberately before continuing.   “They are like you in that regard.  Now what do you want?"

'What makes you think I want or need anything from you?"  Valdayana commented loftily.

"Because the only time anyone approaches me with the pretense of friendship or interest in me is when they want something." 

"Welcome to the real world, Ranger."  Valdayana remarked.  The neo-deity's remark only drew a slight glance from the ranger as she finished disentangling her fishing lure then put it away.  Moments later she pulled out a whittling knife and piece of wood from her pocket and resumed carving a piece of wood she was working with earlier.

"You are not happy."  Valdayana stated point-blank to the ranger.  "Granted you're more sullen than the rest of your flighty hedonistic kind, so it’s kind of hard to tell in most circumstances.  But I know you well enough to know when you are and when you're not."

"Are you so bored that now you've taken an interest in my personal well-being?”  Millikin remarked absently.

"I cannot have my followers unhappy."  Valdayana replied.

"I'm not your follower."  Millikin stated simply.  "Or anyone else's for that matter."

"Of course you are, Ranger.  You've followed my orders for years."

"If I did it was because I believed it was the right course of action.  Not because I feared you or expected any reward for it."

"This age is dying, Ranger."

"What was your first indication?  When all of a sudden people with absolutely no magical training or proclivities instantly developed magical powers literally overnight that made some of the most potent spells possessed by the most talented spellcasters worthless?  Or did the realization hit you recently that a spellcaster's power is no longer determined by their years of study, innate talent, and experience but solely the types of talismans they possess?  Honestly, it doesn't take any kind of intellectual giant to realize the natural order of existence is coming undone.  The gods themselves won't be unscathed before this is done."

"You think Mata`Muram is that powerful?  He couldn't even enter this reality without the help of mere mortals."  Valdayana replied.

"Mere mortals."  Millikin sighed.  "I've seen the geomantic magic the Nihilites are capable of wielding.  And while it's destructive aspect overshadows anything I've seen wielded by a Norrathian, their potential for creation and preservation outstrips their destructive capability by far.  Yet for all that power, the Trusik who tore into Mata`Muram's reality and freed him, are damned for eternity to an existence as ghosts reliving the final months of their destruction.  Only a fool would underestimate that."

"True enough."  Valdayana mused over the ranger's observations.  "What would you do about it?"

"There's nothing I can do."  Millikin began scraping the wood into a point.  "I served my purpose to Tunare.  And since I was discarded when my usefulness ended, I'll watch and wait until oblivion claims me."

"I want you to be my eyes and ears in other realms."

"I don't care what you want."  Millikin stated succinctly.

Part 12

Clearly that was not the response Valdayana D`Varr expected.  Her gaze narrowed slightly as she silently studied the ranger for several moments.

"Did you think because my patron deity abandoned me that I would eagerly become the adherent to the next one to solicit my worship?"

"Actually, yes."  Valdayana answered calmly.

"If I did then you'd still have been too late.  Priests of Discord never cease looking for followers."  The ranger remarked dryly as she turned the piece of wood over to begin whittling on the other side.

"What if I told you that this is part of a bigger picture beyond even Norrath and their pantheon."

"And I should care because..."  Millikin answered.  "The majority of my life was dedicated to helping others.  While I never expected any gratitude for it, I certainly didn't expect being treated like trash would be the norm either.  Nor will I tolerate being treated like such by degenerates anymore."

"Hence why I want you to work as my agent in other realities.  You have no place in Norrath anymore.  And the only time you are ever happy is when you are exploring.  I need to expand my influence.  To do that I need to know which worlds where I can do that most effectively."

"I'm not a proselytizer."  

"You are an efficient scout and pay attention to details.  You will represent my accumulation of esoteric knowledge.  So you needn't worry about the moral implications of anything."  Valdayana explained.

"And what worlds specifically are you talking about?"  Millikin inquired still not looking up from her carving.  "Presuming that I'm disposed to help you."

"Abeir-Toril.  Azeroth.  Eberron.  Thestra.  It's your choice."  

"I see.  And how am I to return if I want or need to?"

"You have the means already, if you recall.  Whenever you like."  Valdayana replied.

"Those are vague directions."  Millikin finished her carving.

"I will show you more specifically how to reach them if you accept my charge."  Valdayana answered.  "Privileged information and all."

"Very well.  I will accept your charge, Tura Valdayana D`Varr."  Millikin handed the carving to the former Teir`Dal who studied the icon for several moments.  It resembled a prowling fox.  She smiled sardonically.

"Keep it in remembrance of your commitment to me."  She handed it back to the ranger.
"One other thing.  Don't be surprised to find that your appearance may change from time to time.  It's a sometimes necessary side-effect for you to most effectively adapt to a given world."  The enchanter vanished almost as quickly as she had appeared

"Thanks for the warning."  Millikin took the fox carving back which was glowing faintly.  She slipped it into her pocket and left with the knowledge of how to reach her new destination.  

Later...

The ranger knew where the abandoned druidae rings were near Kelethin.  It took less than an hour to find the exact stone with the eroded sigils engraved on its side.  She had said her goodbyes to those who mattered a while ago.  As the eldritch light engulfed the wood elf ranger, she never looked back.
