A good friend told me last night that there is only 5 core class usable for Raids. That is Warrior, Monk, Cleric, Nec and Enchanter. Is this true? U might say that it’s the reward for playing a pure class all the way to 50+ I guess.

he is an idiot. Many classes have a role, personally i can't see why he wouldn't consider a Wizard as a great Raid class, for example. Bards also rock IMO and all classes can contribute if played well

Well… you maybe right. I really don’t like this to be hole true myself as my favourite toon is my 39 level Druid which im using to level a 37 level chanter my second pc. So basically he was saying I might just as well get use to playing the enchanter because it would be hard for me to group later on with the Druid.

But I think the idea is that all of these base classes have there roll in a group. The warrior can tank, the monk can pull, the cleric can heal, the Nec… well im not sure about the Nec… steal health and heal? And the Chanter can off cause cast Clarity. So what can a Wiz do that the other classes cant? Nuke maybe but I might not cut it. I now Bards can twist but is that good enough for high level raids?

I could be quit wrong about off this as my highest toon is only level 39. And im not doing this to critises other classes. I just want you input cause I don’t know.

Thanks a lot! It was surely this kind of reply I was hoping for – right to the point. I will keep a copy off this for my own reference.

Btw I did figure out that I was wrong about the Nec – saw one complaining about only being a mana feeder. Guess itsnt that cool to be a Nec in a raid after all :)
