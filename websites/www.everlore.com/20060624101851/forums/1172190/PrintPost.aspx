I am a Guild Leader Of The Midnight Sun. We were up to 96 main chars and about 30 alts then once again we are slipping downwards. We try to have events that will be fun for all, or gain exp, or just learn to hunt together. But for the past many months we are lucky to see 5 show up for the event. About 4/5 of our members never come to the forums to catch up on guild doings either. 2-3 months ago we had almost 1/2 of members above lvl 40. All seemed well and good. Our event calendar was full mainly from our allies inviting us on hunts. In the last 3 weeks we have lost at least 2 dozen lvl 45+ members to other guilds. At least we know our past members will become an asset to that guild. It's frustrating to work long and hard to become a well known guild with a great reputation thinking we soon ready for the planes or the next uber dungeon to realize if we raid anything now it better not be any harder then Black Burrow. So tell me what does your guild do to keep your members happy and interested in staying with you and not another guild? Please reply to this post or e-mail me. Any honest answers will be welcommed as i am not ready to call this guild quits. Not until i am the only 1 left  standing then no way :) Thank you.

WEll, in "Fangs of Wrath" and "Legion of the Damned souls"...we have constant raids and contests.
Since we have a few level 60's they always give out free gear to the most active members. But we dont make meetings required to attend...but tonight, we are having a raid on The Great Oowomp, and maybe Oasis :) So theres my 2 copper worth.

I'm part of CD (Crimson Dragons) and it's the nature of the guild that keeps me in it.  It depends on the people you get into the guild that determines what will keep them there.  For CD, the entrance process is part of a "get to know us" type thing where the main point is that we're all friends having fun.  I stay in CD because of the nice people I have met there.  CD is also part of a Brotherhood now, and anything we couldn't do before, is now open to us.  

Everyone gets distraught though, and sometimes a chain of events can lead to people just needing a new place to sit.  For some people loot and raids will keep them in place, for others, all it takes is a smile.  

I recently was away from EQ for a while and had planned on leaving CD and joining a power guild when I came back, but getting back on and talking to the friends I had made swept away all those thoughts.  Find out what motivates your members, and you find your answer.

My guild *im just an officer mind ya now* is fairly small it consists of friends and that alone keeps it together. Although we might wish to do more active raids the raids are not what keep us together more than the social and psychological atmosphere that comes from knowing your among safe friends. I would think that maybe a better infrastructure that puts certain cliques with their own leader type to keep that leader satisfied and then that leader will have their own followers that stay around for the same friendship reasons might be a good tactic. I am unsure how you dole out your leaders though. It would be a personal choice thing for you. You have a very big base of users but big isnt necessarily always a good thing. You might have beuracracy over who gets to do what going on that will cause splits as some leave because so and so is a snot or so and so didnt let me loot that item or so and so can do this but Im told im not allowed etc etc.. about anything you can picture siblings in a family fighting over is what you could find among members. The more members the higher chance of sibling rivalry so to speak and power hungry toons competiting. What power is there of a lead? Not much if they have no followers be my guess.. but they still want a title *shrug* No clue if any of this helps.. I wish you luck in your keeping a guild alive.

Well we are still going strong. Lost 15 or so but holding steady at 73+ (roster keeper on vacation). When we lose an Officer i ask the membership if anyone is looking to become an Officer then i bring those names to the Officer forum to be discussed. We then vote on them and majority wins.

If i was you, plan raids often, plan get togethers, and most of all, plan FUN events! My guild planned a BoTB for the guild, all most all of the guild showed up! We did it in lvls for like 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49,etc etc, im sure you get the idea. And we rewards, and prizes. We only had a BoTB for lvls because if everyone went at it, the most higher chars would win. But after the best of the lvls went on, they wanted to have a free for all of the BoTB for lvls, so all 5 went out, the 4 of the 10-49 winners, teamed up on the 50-60 winner, he lost. Then the 2 winners from 20-39 went at, and so did 10-29, then right after that, the last to standing went at it. And of coarse there was a winnder. But that was a GREAT event. We hold events like drunken races from here to there. Parties, and other things. So keep trying to have events and raids and such, as often as you can.

I am a new member in The Nine Chambers guild. First off, these are MATURE, kind, helpful people. The guild chatter is non stop. I think these factors keep things very alive.

I just attended my first Guild event which was a language class. People who knew a language created a hot keyed phrase in an unknown tongue and clicked it over and over for the assembled group. They did this as long as someone needed to attain mastery. It was wild.

We would run back and forth across the zone to check our results. At one point I was learning Elder Dragon, Thieves chant and something else all simultaneously. I highly recommend this as a group event. People didn't want to go to bed because it was so fun. Some were still up at 3AM EST.

Raid..Raid...Raid...with the new planes coming out there is all kinds of stuff to explore AND you need to set up raid points to keep everone at the events they don't come, then they don't get the points so next time ol' lodzial pops and they need the shell the person with the most points gets.
