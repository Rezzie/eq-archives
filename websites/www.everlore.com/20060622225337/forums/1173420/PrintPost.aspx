I started EQ Dec 2001 at the vehement request of a RL friend whom I played Diablo I & II with for the last couple of years.  My main thing was when EQ came out, I did not see the point in paying a monthly fee after buying the game when Battle.net was free.  When my buddy told me he got EQ, I thought he was crazy.  Of course I didn't see him and Battle.net for the next three months, and after he talked me into EQ, I have not been on it since either!!!

As a "casual" (I guess there are several different takes on what that really means - I play one or two nights a week for a couple hours and Saturday from ~11 AM - ~5 PM) player, I have gotten my human monk to level 10, but have been a solo machine with very little interaction with other people in the game.  2 weeks ago, that changed ( and changed my whole take on the game).

I have only grouped once, and that was with my RL friend, but he usually plays with his main - a lvl 35 Druid.  As I have been shying away from grouping, I decided it was time to make some money from the stuff I killed in EC instead of selling it to the vendors.  After making a trip to Monkly-Business, I decided to collect Bone Chips, Pelts, Silks, and Lightstones.  Well, I must say that my initial experiences with auctioning have been VERY good.  I have sold Bone Chips, Silks, and Pelts to players and have put 200pp in my pocket as a result.  I believe this is the start of something good for me in my EQ experience, as I am starting to really interact with others in ONE of the ways that EQ was created for.  I think when I start grouping, I will really discover the facets of the game that have been previously lacking.  Like I said, being a true newbie, this is an overwhelming world, but as I have decided to dip my feet in the water, I have been receiving the dividends of that step forward.  I used to be afraid that others would not be so tolerant of my actions, since I had NO idea about things group-related, but I have been immersed (literally) in forums for the past two weeks - mostly as a start to discover the "secrets" of good auctioneering, but I have read MANY posts about how people really expect you to function in Norrath.  Quite a learning expereince in itself.  Though I have come across several posts that made me want to shrink back into my shell, I have realized that the majority out there are VERY tolerant of newbies &lt;breathes a sigh of relief>.  I think I am going to start slow though with a partner as opposed to a full group so I can learn the many nuances of the grouping "way" before I go full on into a group where my actions will have a greater impact on the success/failure of the group.  To say I am excited would be to understate the situation.  My goal is not "phat lewt" or xp grinding, though if that happens, I will not be upset!!!  I just want to casually become acclimated to the task of working with other people in that situation.  "Getting my feet wet" would sum up my expectations exactly.

Like I said earlier, I didn't have GREAT expectations for EQ, but as of the last couple of weeks, I have taken on a completely different attitude and have a true excitement about this world I have jumped into - and now I am addicted like a crack addict!!!!

If you are in the same boat as I am, and you want to partner up with me, feel free to send me a tell in-game or shoot me an email; I will be more than happy to conquer my "fears" and enjoy a previously unvisited aspect of the world of Norrath!!!

As these are my "simple" observations, I am welcome to any comments or suggestions from those who have a great deal more experience than I.  Thanks in advance.

You can group with me anytime. I was a newbie once too, and know what it is like. I have a lvl 11 druid currently and would be happy to group with you anytime. My main is Charbeau lvl 44 Shaman, and always happy to buff newbs and help in any way I can. Send me a tell and I'll be happy to log on my lvl 11 Druid Myara and group with you!
See online!
Charbeau.
