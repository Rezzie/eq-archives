With all the enhancements you can get with both the AA points and armor enhancements(+STR, +crack) Is it possible to make an effective meleerer out of a Cleric? 
I'm not certain that they have a cap on Cleric melee skills. I know that i cannot get over 75 skill in dodge, but with AA pts i can increase all these skills. What are you thoughts on this. 
While i love playing a cleric, i HATE sitting around and medding while everyone else fights. BUT the option of sitting around when you want to is a very nice thing...........
SO battle cleric possible? or not?

Being a battle cleric is actually encounter dependent.  It all depends on how things are going if you can melee and keep the mana good enough or if you need to sit heal sit heal.

So in one way it is possible, but it is also possible to keep us on our rumps healing healing healing.  I know that isn't the answer you were looking for but I think it is the closest to reality.

I do melee, and add to the DPS of my group, but I will never be an effective meleer the way any tank or hybrid tank is.

Where's Ramanon to see me say I melee :)

After 55+ or so, with proper gear and possibly AAs, a cleric can actually add enough DPS to warrant not sitting on their ass. (not like that's a bad thing, I only have as much HP as the cleric has mana, dontcha know! :))

I know plenty of botted clerics that melee if they aren't needed to heal.  Hell, I can vaguely picture at least 2-3 clerics that melee when not needed to heal.

But Zheldon is right on when he said "encounter dependent".  Can't be more correct with that statement.

At lvl 59 now, without any special AAs, I do melee when I am full mana, more for fun than DPS.  But if I care about DPS, I will sit and nuke.  Btw I usually never use my Stun spell line cause it move mob and tanks dont like it (main in front of it and the other in back make it difficult to them to not loose swing).

To get the feel of my tank abilities;)

my 1hb is at 175 and my pet do much more damage than me ;)

Anyway, 1st of all have fun friend!

64 Cleric here...

I melee when I'm 80% mana or more.  Normally on LDoN runs, though our group just broke into the level 65 dungeons so I've been meleeing much less.  I have actually parsed the logs...I average around 20 DPS.  So really I just like to see my summoned hammer proc :) but the added DPS is just that, and every point helps ;).

Those hammers are sweet.  With a bard or shaman or bst to up your dex, those hammers proc like no tomorrow.

Don't be afraid to use your stun spells that have knockback - though, try to save it for a good reason (such as a wiz mob that's about to IC someone or something like that).

As a tank, I don't mind those...if you include a /gsay with it - /g "Stunning %T - pushing it in the direction I'm facing!!"

With that advanced knowledge, I can watch for the "XXX is struck by a sudden force" message and move accordingly.  Best to only do that on exp grinds, though.  This can cause havoc on a raid.

I love to melee, do all the time. Get a haste item like a CoF (haha sound really strange coming from a cleric) with the combination of your hammer at 56+ and yaulp meleeing is simple. Buff up and go for it. Solo full camps in kc actually- rcy,lcy,hands,basement, or whatever im in the mood for. If your going to solo preferably go to old world zones, so much easier on the mana/hp front. Also just make sure you know what your doing and that your bound not to far away.... gating is very effective if things get out of hand. You have pacify and a memory blur (atone) by 56, you can solo pull and if neccessary mem blur. Not that hard actually. GL

yealp5 (becuase of its massive dex bonus for procing and it recorvers almost as much mana as when u sit) + godly super procing hammer + kei + your group alowing u to do it and youll be fine.  u can melee if u want but you will be farly infective and you cant get hit or your going to hit the ground

Have to disagree w/ you Anon on one point. Clerics are plate-wearing for a reason, so we don't wilt when a mob smacks us around. 

I guarantee you it doesn't take me meleeing to get the mob's attention. All I need to do is heal the enchanter who has aggro -- I get their attention fast then. So yes, I had better be able to take some hits.

at 56, with c3 and maybe a PoT9 or SD, ill conjure up my hammer and start swingin.  step back to heal once in a while.  I also like to use my hammer pet, and toss on either Mark of Karn or Mark of Retribution for some added dmg, or very light healing.  But, as stated above, its very encounter depended.  LDoN is the only time i really do this...as at my level, while i can keep up with the group easily in PoV or PoS, sometimes things can get nutty.  Prolly the one thing youll wanna remember though is try to stay behind the mob if you melee, so your not takin riposte dmg.

Prolog 

"the battle cleric is a very controversial figure in the world of everquest, sometimes, to such an extent that their motives are questioned and others flat out refuse to pvp with them, thus i believe it is my duty to enlighten those that have not yet come to understand the full glory of THE BATTLE CLERIC what he truly is and how that benefits others" 

those clerics that practice the fine arts of melee against a target are generally given the term "battle cleric". mainly attributing to there higher then normal AC, ATK, meleeing skills, equipment choices, as well as their extremely aggressive play style. 

battle clerics many times find themselves engaged in roles traditionally reserved for melees proper for pve, such as pulling, and even tanking. 

for pvp, the battle cleric's moniker is his BASH as well as geting some unresistable damage on there target. in Addison to performing there normal clerical duties. 

the battle clerics spits in the face of the tradition, that clerics are lowly heal bitchs thats only job is to read health and mana bars and squeal like stuck pigs if a, mob or player, attacks them. 


(forms of damage and spell line up) 

when mana and circumstance permit clerics are have the ability of doing damage to there targets. 

this takes the form of DD, stun dd, and other "pet"/ cleric melee 

at lvl 54 clerics can use a 5.5 sec 250 mana 7.5 sec repop DD that "possibly best case scenario does about 630 damage to a target that has been tashed PvE" 

for stuns the damage is insignificant and there main purpose is used to interrupt spells so they will not be discussed in depth 

"the pet" is a interesting beast. it only takes 2.5 seconds to cast for 175mana. it has very low hitpoints 100hp, yet it completely magic resistant fire/cold/magic maybe poison and dease too. it also is a very decent dammage dealer in its own right, double attacking for 30s or 70s .. 60-140 dammage per wave of swings. it also adds as anouther "thing" to "deal with" 

and of course the bread and butter of the battle cleric, his own personal melee. at 54 a battle cleric should have 175 1hb skill and 141 bash a delvled 55 cleric has 145 bash skill. 
with an hammer of dubious quality he can swing for 20-30 damage a hit at a rate of 20 dly + whatever haste equitment/spells + a extra weapon proc and bash for 30-70 damage. the bash also creates a stun effect and instantly interrupts its target during casting. 


Of course the spell line up on a battle cleric is METT dependant. but his 6 modular type spells are 

Stuns "stuncommand (55), stun, sounding force, etc) 
heavy heal (divine light, dot heal,CH) 
pet 
DD "reckoning" 
blind (although almost never droped from the spell line up) 
or other (dispell, cures, utility, buffs ect) 

2 divine auras, gate, and quick heal, are always loaded. 

(come on lucky 7) 

when a cleric DDs manytimes this is looked at as rolling the dice, 5.5 seconds of hand giggling required, sence MR is the number 1 most pushed resist in the game, and clerics DD is checked by that resist. it is not a reliable means of dishing out damage. 

Meleeing on the other hand is also an option because you are always going to "get some" and the "bash" is a way to help "control" the target., how many times have you seen a SK or a paladin opt for a 1h weapon so they can BASH? a battle cleric is bringing that to the table also. 

furthermore meleeing can be "turned off" instantly unlike a spell, that requires "ducking" furthermore the damage is done instantly so it isnt "wasted time" unlike a DD, that needed to be stopped because something "more important" came up, such as a reblinding, a stun, or a heal. 

although meleeing is free mana wise it takes is own toll, "target fixation" and losing situational awareness is a constant thorn in there side, yet one they try to over come with experience. 


(battle clerics love attention) 
all clerics know, folks love to kill them, battle clerics tellem to bring it on! 

with high ac and hopefully hitpoints as well as a keen finger on the DA, a battle cleric can easily keep the enemy distracted and keep the enemy from "agrooing" on weaker classes such as wizards and enchanters. also staying near the target and near there teammates without having to "run around like a chickin with there head chopped off" is a good thing because the enchanter will "eventually", get them off you, why make his job even harder? 

and if your there welcoming their blows then why would they run, maybe they can "drag the cleric down with them" hehe unlikely , but the enemy dont know that  

(battle clerics know) 
battle clerics know that they are different, and defy the norm in EQ. because they experiment and try to push the envelope trying to bring out there class's full potential, this is a good thing, yet like all new ways will have some bumps on the noggin geting perfected. also more pressure is put on them because they "have something to prove" so a higher level of performance is demanded out of them, and its to be expected, they are blazing new trails afterall. 


i could run numbers and examples with you all day, but the truth of the matter is, different people play differently. the battle cleric, is a good style of play for a certain type of person thats comfortable with that. for those of you that already have clerics, maybe its something you could try out, you might find it useful yourself, or atleast find new holes in battle clerics play style. either way you will become more informed about your class and i'm sure a better player for it. 

thanks for reading, 
frank
