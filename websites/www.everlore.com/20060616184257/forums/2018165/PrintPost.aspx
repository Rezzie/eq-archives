I'm a long retired EQ player so I don't know much about what's been going on.&nbsp; I'm just about to graduate a video game design course and I'm currently writing a thesis on MMORPGs.&nbsp; To make a long story short there was an old site I was trying to uncover but its been buried over time.&nbsp; I remember the link was through everlore so that's why I came here.&nbsp; Now here is the major dilemna, I've forgotten the name of the tavern so let me describe it to you.&nbsp; Hopefully someone can help me.<br><br>It was a story driven site dedicated to the players of Everquest.&nbsp; I seem to remember their being a Bard in the title, as well as Tavern.&nbsp; There were many colourful characters involved in the stories and they directly reflected what was going on during the early years of Everquest so this would be most useful for the research I'm embarking on.&nbsp; <br><br>My particular character was Malignus Sunslayer, a dark elf shadowknight bent on making the lives of the involved characters a living hell.&nbsp; His son Rendel soon followed.&nbsp; <br><br>If anyone can give me any information on this lost website please let me know!!!<br><br>Thanks<br>
