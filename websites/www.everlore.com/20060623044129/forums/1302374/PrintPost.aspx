Heya people. 

As i quite often posted in this forum, i let you all know i finaly finished my Epic last Saturday. Here is a summary and some pictures i took of it (link to our guild's gallery).

<A HREF="http://web1.249238.vserver.de/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=&postid=35975#post35975" TARGET="_BLANK">http://web1.249238.vserver.de/vbulletin/showthread.php?s=&postid=35975#post35975</A>

I did the Epic entirely, all the way it was supposed to be done. Didn't cheat at anytime and i can tell you it's the nicest quest i've done so far. Here are my conclusions on main points about Epic Quest :

Test of Patience : You have to wait about 30/40 mn underwater, get some fish scales to cast Enduring breath on you. Also, check you always have invisibility on you (just remove it when Abe spawns to talk to him). This part isn't hard if you take care of being invisible, just be patient.
* Forces i had with me for this event : none.

Black Dire : Easy fight when you are 45 or above. I didn't have to run through castle to kill his PH, he was up. Killed it and his 4 pets in like 1 mn.
* Forces i had with me for this event : 1 guildie shaman (lvl 60).

The REALLY boring thing for me was to get the Spectral Courrier to spawn (CoM) and drop the RIGHT item (don't drop it all the time). I had to kill it like 10 times before i got the Studend's Log. Asked other shaman among the guild, they all looted if after 1 to 4 attempts so it seems i've been quite unlucky on this one. Other 5 pages are common drop.
* Forces i had with me for this event : none.

Lord Ghiosk : He isn't hard if you got enough people. I did him when we went initialy to CoM for one of our enchanter's epic. His mob didn't spawn so we did reavers to pop Lord Ghiosk. We engaged one reaver who respawned SIXTY SEVEN times in a row. Lord Ghiosk also spawn along with the 5th reaver. Killed him really quickly. 
* Forces i had with me for this event : 10 guildies (lvl 56-65).  

High Scale Kirn : Hardest thing is to convince enough people to come with you to the Hole. An enchanter is an absolute necessity if you want it to be done smoothly, easily and quickly. Took us about 45 mn / 1 hour from zone in to the time we killed him.
* Forces i had with me for this event : 10 guildies (lvl 55-62).

The Tear : I'm lucky i'm in a guild able to clear entire Plane of Fear. As we regularly raid there to kill CT, it showed no difficulty for me to get my Tear. In fact, i looted my Tear at a time i didn't even killed Lord Ghiosk. Remember also that the tear isn't MQ'able at all anymore.
* Forces i had with me for this event : Most of the guild (lvl 55-65) (did this on a CT raid).

Neh'Ashiir : No difficulty at all, basic fight. She went down in like 25 seconds if not less. She won't really harm you if you got a good tank to hold aggro after turn in.
* Forces i had with me for this event : 10 guildies (lvl 56-65)

Lord Rak'Ashiir : Well, i died like most shaman do here. When i handled the item i was at 40% health and 15% mana (had rebuffed all people who came + pets). The fight took about 3 to 5 minutes, no one but me and Lord Rak'Ashiir died. Positionning is the key in this fight (we did it in the throne room, definitly the best spot for this, just handle the item, go in a corner and wait you die. Magician pets will continue the fight for you (we had 2 lvl 60+ magician's pet) while the rest of the team is safe on the stairs.

WOOT ! AT LAST I GOT MY SPEAR OF FATE !
(happens the same day i dinged 57, was a nice Saturday).
