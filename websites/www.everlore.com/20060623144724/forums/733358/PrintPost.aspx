Greetings other users of the dark arts.  I am still young in this world only level 11.  Just the other day I batteled a player for the frist time, he was a gnome enchanter of the same level, anyways he wiped the floor with me.  I refuse to belive that I could not have done better.  So I ask anyone who wishes to listen, what tacics I should have used to bring that little gnome down.  Any help will be appreciated.

Relisin,

Nah, seriously, you have to come with little more info about how he owned you?

more info would be great, it had to be the gear playing a necro and enchanter necros way outdamage the chanter with pets and dots, thing is you would have to be careful about mezz although it doesn't do much damage.  in all my dueling pvp encounters i never really had an offense with my chanter however i was able to escape fairly easy with a decent defense.  i'd say check out his gear see if it's equal to yours or if hes toting around a fungi/other twink gear which could be the reason you were owned.  enchanters really only get like one decent dd spell line that i'm aware of, plus they can debuff the piss out of ya.  necro stratagy send pet root chanter pet if he has one which may not be the best thing since chanter pets break thier own mezzes at least in my exp, darkness line on chanter lifetap lifetap lifetap till dead.  my advice but may not be the most effective since i havn't played either my necro or chanter in a long while.

Sadly, he is lvl 11, root for necromancers is availible at lvl 34 i belive?

Its most likely however an equipment issue.

at 11th you are a bit gimp.  no real DD spells and your taps are weak.  your pet is a tad better then his, but not so much + he will have Rune1 up on his pet (IIRC that is an 8th spell for chanter, maybe a 12th, but i think its 8th) and he may even have haste and slow by 8th.  been so long since i played a chanter that i can not remember.

both of you will have fear to send the others pet running off in the far distance.  dont snare his pet, just fear it.

best thing you can do at that low of a level is hit him with your fastest casting spell first (4th - 8th level spell, dont try any level 1 spells on him) to interupt his first spell.  then keep on him so he can not cast anything.  most chanter spells have a longer delay then necros at this level so unless as mentioned above he is twinked then you have a chance of beating him, but only if you use faster casting spells that deal some damage and can ignore his pet.

if you can get fear on his pet yours will beat it down enough to get though runeI, and chew into its HP enough that you can then still have a pet near the end of the fight.

you dont have any stun type spells, you dont have blind or anything along those lines YET so stick with your fast DoTs and your taps.

if you have shadowstep get it up and us it.  this will make it harder for him to find you, and for you to find him.  it then becomes a game of who can find who first and attack.  you can shadow step even if he roots you.

an other thing you can do is find your friendly 60+ mage and have them summon you a full set of pet toys and mana preserv, spell haste (may not be worth it as i think it only works on spells with a delay longer then 4seconds) DD, and DoT enhancements.  the last 2 are great for a necro.

get your lich line up (forget what its called but your level 8 spell) and if you start getting to low on life, click it off.

best of luck.

Thank you all for the imput.  The more I think about it the more I belive he was twinked to the extreme.  Running around with his level 55 warrior friend, and also the fact that I nailed him with all my spells till my mana was gone and never made a dent in his hp.  Next time I will inspect those so eager to duel me.  And if I run into that gnome in the future when I have established myself I will settle the score.
