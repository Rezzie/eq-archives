You can get the Power of Fire off the Blazing Elementals or the Lava Elemental. If you choose the Lava Elemental becareful you will get bad factions. I went in there at lvl 50 and could not hold down the whole room myself. The CWGs assist the wandering CWG place holder and the Lava Elemental. I brought along a lvl 50 cleric to help and could barely hold the room. I killed the Lava Twice and he doesn't drop the Power of Fire everytime it's just he drops it more often than the blazings. When the cleric left I stood no chance against the room so I went back to the blazing elementals. After about 18 hours of mostly camping the Blazings the Power of Fire dropped Twice in a row on the same room spawn.  Sucked to watch one rot after all that time spent. Hope this clears up some confusion. Good luck all.

Yesterday, myself and my guildmate decided to work on a part of our epic together. We had already gone through the lists and knew that going as a duo would be far easier to hold down than to solo it. So we refreshed our KEIs (I'm level 55 and guildie was 53) and met in Lavastorm at the SolA Entrance. Grouped up and went in, cleared out much of the entrance.
 After about an hour of wandering around searching for the elementals, I was about to kill another cinder goblin shaman when BOOM I stepped forward and right into a pit trap where 4 blazing elementals attempted to gangbang my Erudian ass back to my bind point in the Nexus. Lucky me my water pet was DS'ed and hurried down to my rescue. Out of the four kills, two bloodstones and a Power of Fire dropped! I shouted out my find, screamed my glee to my guild (who had to put up with it because I'm the leader) and did my emoted-happy dance. My guildie dropped down beside me and waited. And waited. Killed 2 spawns. And waited. I had to log for the night while he was still camping the basement spawns on a 25-minute spawn timer so I'm unsure if he got his power yet. I hope he did, it sounds pretty rare:(
