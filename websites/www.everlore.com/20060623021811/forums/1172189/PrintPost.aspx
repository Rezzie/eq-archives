The site we now have uses html and who knows what else lol. Seeing as we go through moderators slowly it still happens that we find ourselves at the mercy of a past one to update our site. Can anyone tell me of a good place to check for a simple to use webpage? We also use ezboards for our forums. I looked at Guildmagic tonight but that was not what i looking for. Thanks :)

Websites are not that hard. Get a freeware copy of a website creater and go to work.. its all pretty much plug and paste. If you need a message board using a link to a free message board that has their own moderators finegeling the code might be the option.. in which case you just add the link to your own HTML page and poof .. yer all set.

I've always liked the current MS site and layout (though your calendar is kinda ugly with the yellow and green on black).

One of the problems with a guild slipping like this (same problem with SoV, which is why I left), is that a guild can't do much as a guild unless members participate.  SoV raids usually consisted of 3 to 5 Officers, who had planned the raid in the first place, and anywhere from zero to three regular members.

It didn't help my level of frustration that most Officers were 45+ whereas regular members are 10 to 30.  Three or four 50+ Officers and two or three 20's are not a raid; they are a very-planned-in-advance powerleveling session.

You will need members to actually care about the guild.  With the number of 40+ and 50+ you had last time I had looked at your roster, you could've started doing a lot of neat stuff and grown quickly.  From the looks of it, your members were the impatient type who wanted a guild that would go to Hate as soon as they dinged 48 (some may call me impatient, but I think a year is a pretty long wait for a guild to pick itself up, sorry Krys).

Edit: Well, looks like I kinda responded to your other post in this one too.  Heh, got off on a semi-rant there.
