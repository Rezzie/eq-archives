The only item I would look into changing, but then I'm not great at "equipment checks", is that right bracer - defenders bracer.  Almost anything is going to be better than that.

Here's my suggestions, they are just my opinions and what I would do. Thought I'd give some advice :D

First, I see you have a windblade. How much do they go for on your server? On mine, they go for 70k. I would sell the windblade, and either get a War Marshall's Bladed Staff or even a Tae Ew Two Hand Sword, or for a more affordable version of Windblade, Heavy Windrider's Lance ... I'm using the Lance because the ratio is comparable to the Windblade.

Windblade has a 1.14 ratio, Heavy Windriders Lance has a 1.13 ratio, war marshalls bladed staff is 1.11. So really go with whichever is cheapest to help you get upgrades.

Now, if you do decide to sell the windblade, and get say either the Lance or the WMBS, first thing I would do is get rid of those rings. Replace them with Valorium rings of gallantry, or one Ring of Flowing Slime and one Valorium. Get rid of the Oplulant earring of ken, and get a mosquito leg earring if you cant affrod Bloodmetal Earring of Engagement. Upgrading that ear and your fingers would give you a nice boost.

Replace your lesser wrist with another Underfoot Platemail Bracer.

Shoulders - Barbed Dragonscale would be the best. Once you have the extra cash, go for Chokidai Hide Pauldrons.

Replace neck with Clattering Bone Necklace. 

You might be running out of cash by now, or close to it. Start saving up for better upgrades. One thing I would worry about once I get the above mentioned taken care if, is to replace your belt with Soulscream belt, which is 31% haste, and after that, go with Kylong Darkmail Gaunts to replace your SCHW.

thats really it ... the bad thing about being or nearing close to 60, you'll have to invest ALOT of plat in your char, especially if you're a tank. this past month alone I've spent over 200k on ornate for my paladin. My paladin's magelo is included in my sig, have a look at it, and you can see some of the items I've mentioned.

/em is done with peaking and installs a permanent wisp-light gnome tinkered camcorder under the robe.

The high 50s through lvl65 can be a tough time for equipment.  The items you've been wearing that were just fine up to the low 50s just don't get the job done anymore.

Though I used a Windblade up until a few days ago when I was able to get a nice no drop pally only weapon, I like the suggestion of selling for a WMBS or heavy windriders.  Either of those weapons is a very respectable weapon, and I see many level 60+ pallys using them.  This is only if your strapped for cash, mind you, if you have some pp to upgrade, I'd keep the windblade.

Another suggestion, I would start doing LDoNs asap.  Specifically, North Ro (or Tak themed) LDoNs.  I know it seems like a long way off, but the plate armor for 1492pts out of Tak is very respectable, and, if augmented correctly, better than ornate in terms of stats (obviously you have to consider the right click effect of ornate when comparing the two, but to me, its not worth the kind of pp being asked...currently 250K and up on my server).  The XP in a high 50s level LDoN isn't what you'll get in plane of storms or plane of valor, but its not too terrible, and you'll start earning the pts you can utilize for new armor.  In addition, you get the opportunity at aug drops and drops off named.  If you have some higher lvl friends who will allow you to go along on lvl63+ dungeons, the xp actually gets very decent.

By the way, the player makes the character, not the equipment.  Equipment can make a good player better, but it cannot make a bad player good.  There are an amazing number of lvl60+ players out there who do not have a clue as to how to play their classes...equipment upgrades won't do them any good.  I know several players in RL who are great players, but don't play enough to accumulate the pp for better gear.  They rarely spend much time looking for groups as those who know them always jump at the opportunity to group with them.

That was really well written, Rofeus.  I hope you stick around Everlore for a while.  If the registering link is working again, you might even consider that.

I definitely agree with the LDoN suggestion. That was perhaps the best expansion for the casual player. Look out for Face Mask of Frozen Manafrom normal difficulty Everfrost adventures, and Architect's Bejeweled Chestplate from normal NRo. Also, grab the free PoP charm from Gran Drunnar in PoK, and throw on the adventurer's stone. Those stats can add up.

Focus on North Ro, but don't turn down Everfrost groups either. Besides the aforementioned mask, there is some decent gear to be had. Though not quite as good as Royal Attendants, they are quite a bit cheaper, and many people (myself included) still choose the EF legs over NRo. Also the FT2 chest aug is a steal at 510 points. Fortunately, after you've gotten 1492 points in NRo, you can adventure anywhere and use those points for more RA gear if you like.

Other than that, I agree you could probably get a good deal on a WB, replace it with a WMBS, and use the significant difference to help out in other areas (depends on your server's economy of course). Consider a better haste item perhaps.

Well ive done the best i can for now until i start to farm more pp.  I am guildless, and have very limited time online which will make it hard for me to upgrade to anything really worthwhile.  About the Windblade, i paid about 30k for it a while ago and before it i had a WMBS.  I found it hard to solo with it.  I like the slower delay on windblade, it allows me to cast between swing without hurtin dps.  WMBS doesnt allow me to do that without sacraficing dps.  I have on the other hand finished a lot of armor upgrades.tyvm for all the info.  I just recently soloed through 59 in PoJ walking out with almost 3 stacks of Blue diamond, not metioning all the other loot.  That helped with all my other upgrades. For the time being i will stick with AAing so i may be able to solo a bit better in velks.  Again tyvm for all the useful info :)
