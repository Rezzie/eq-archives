started working my epic last night.  yeah i know get ready for some extreemly long camps and major disapointments in the mean time.

i just finished the relay race and killed the doppelganer in the karanas.  hehe,  guild had me a bit scared that i could not kill him, but it was cake.  he was light blue and only hit me 1 time for just over 400 points with a nuke.  i chant kited him down and the rest of the camp left me alone.

we took 5 members (way overkill mind you) to BW for Nezekeneza(sp?) to get the red guts, and hope for the embers to drop.  we killed Neze about 8 times with no embers.  both bards got our guts.  

i plan on soloing the drake in RM today, and maybe tonight trying to figure out the SF chromo.

dont think i can solo the SF chromo yet as my melee is rather pathetic and IIRC he summons.  so ill bring a tank along and a healer and were try to blow him up.  *BOOM*

goal is to have my 25th page before end of week.  baring IRL issues with getting the school back up and running after the holidays.

ok ouch:  Rharzar chased me out of RM this morning.  him hit hard for a 55th mob.  mega resists if he can be cast on at all.  resisted my 3 dots i had up (fire, cold. dis) doubled for 170, and DD for 700+.  only reason i lived was i had temp up left over from last nights hunt in BW.

ok ill go back and try looking for blackwing again tonight, but ill bring frinds with me this time :D

Blackwing is easy, he pops in the area between the hill giants and the zone to Fearrott, a smaller hill in there with some drakes and lots of lizardmen and such.  Just kill everything you see, he's a random spawn and it seems, much like the hill giants, just about anything in that area can serve as a PH.  Took me about 20 minutes of slaughter to get him to pop and i easily soloed him in my early 50's.

You will need either the help of a couple powerful friends or  a full group of your peers to take down the chromodrac, she's an enchanter, she will charm you easily, mezz you, nuke the crap out of you, melee you down, summon, etc.. all the nasty stuff that enchanter dragons are capable of.  She's not the be all end all of wurms or anything, I brought 2 druid friends and a wizard and charmed a pet to tank her while we dotted and nuked her down.  Just kill stuff between the broken wall and the zone to BW in SF... she pops in there and wanders from the hills side over to the wall and back.

I did Nezzy with my wizard friend, she dropped easily and we got her to spawn quite a few times once we got her PH, easy hunt, did the bard fear/melee thing and just chased her around the zone beating on her while the wiz nuked.

The werewolf head is easy as well.  I got mine on the way to a VS kill, we did part of the Concussion spell quest for a couple of our wizzy's at the same time.  The amy whip was pretty easy too, we were up there just doing a Fear hit, not specifically looking for the whip but several dropped in the 3 hours we were in the zone.. we took the golem down too, again for the wizard epic.

Phinny is insanely easy, we've got him down to a science now since we've killed him 7 times in a row now and not seen the wizard epic.  I sit at zone, wizard sends eye of zomm into Phinny's pit to target him then nukes him... soon as the nuke lands he gates to the zoneline where he's bound, not succor but gate so he keeps agro.  Phinny and a couple of his guards come running to the zoneline, when they get there I mezz phinny and we both zone out.  Zone back in and phinny is standing at zone line and his guards have returned to the pit, mezz, mana drain, beat him down.  I can solo him too but why when I'm only there for my wiz friend, I got the spine on the first kill.

The scales... well, I bought mine, too high for Vox and Naggy raids and not enough patience for Gore or the Hole, I won /rands on a couple of Delightful Orbs of Forgotten magic, sold them for 22kpp each and bought my scales.

Yesterday I watched an 8 man team take UDB and Trak down... all PoT equipped with 400 or so AA's... the shaman that was in the group has soloed most of the kunark dragons, pretty impressive since I've seen Trak take down entire guilds :)

Good luck Lleb.

My guild on Tunare is about to take on Trak.  Granted, we have a couple of Time equipped guys in our guild (their mains are in different guilds...they moved on but left their alts in our guild).  They think we can probably do him.

Our Guild Mage (the highest one) 2-boxes Phinny with 2 mages.  Not sure what his technique is, but he considers it cake.  With a cleric, it is cake.  Phinny's guards can be cleric pacified (might need level 65 pacification)...then phinny solo pulled.

"You will need either the help of a couple powerful friends or a full group of your peers to take down the chromodrac"

Eldrigs a joke really. just fear kite, with some charm for good measure. I managed it at 51 solo, but MQed it to a friend since my bard was an alt then really. The only problem is getting him to spawn. That you could use afew friends for.

I had problems with Eldrig but I don't remember what level I took him at.  I was camping the giant fort in BW so it must've been early to mid 40's.  I'd run through SF to bank at the fort in OT and just kept and eye out for Eldrig every time I went through the zone.  Never tried fearing Eldrig but then the first time I saw him up I just called on a couple bored frieds who gated in and helped me kill him right by the wizard zone in.

kewl.

we got blackwing to spawn 2 times and each of us got our gut.  we did have to call on a BL, cleric, and pally to take out Rhazar though.  that bugger is nasty.

no casting on him.  im guessing 100% immune to spells.  even with OSS on him he would resist everything even from 60th cleric.  oh well.  we finished him off 1 time and killed a ton of greens to get blackwing to spawn.

then we headed down to SF.  he hit the 'spawn point', but did not get the PH to pop so no Eldrig for us that night.

i was planning on fear kitting him down after reading up on that part of the epic from eqdiva.

thanks for the info on how to do phini.  that will really help.   not there yet,  and like you ill prob.  have to buy my scales as im to high for old world dragons, and not sure about the other ones.

oh well tomorrow it looks like we will go back to SF and try for Eldrig again.  ill move the group down to the SF spot on the map tomorrow and see if that will not make life simpler for at least pulling more mobs for better xp.

There are a number of ways to pull Phinegal safely and easily.  The first and most obvious is to lull his guards and just yank him out of the pit.  With the nerf on lull and the number of guards and the slower movement under water along with the darkness of his lair make this a little dicey but it works, it's how I did him the first time.  When I soloed him I did invis, swam down into his pit, got situated in a deep corner and waited till he swam by, he rushed me but was out of range of his guards agro so it was just me and him in the bottom of the pit, mezz, drain, melee... if I need a pause to regen some health I'd just mezz him and play Marr/Niv's for a couple twists then back to beating him down.  I already mentioned the technique with a wizard partner though and that seems to work very well.

Just to be safe the wiz burries Rune under some junk buffs so he can get his gate spell off and not have rune dispelled... the first time he tried the nuke and gate thing he was immediately stunned by a seahorse and all of them agroed, he lasted about 10 seconds.... that's actually why i was in the bottom of the pit soloing Phinny, I was there on a corpse run :)

Grats on all you've done so far Lleb. I only have the first page, Whip and guts. I have been so busy working on my PoP flagging so I can join my guild in the Elemental Planes that I haven't had time for my epic. It's only a matter of time for me but I'm LOVING the raids and love seeing new content now.

missed him yesterday.  logged in during the afternoon (230-430pm) to see if i could find him up.  only 1 other toon in SF and he had killed eldrig a few times before i got there, and eldrig did not spawn in that 2hr slot.  *frown*

then again latter that night spent an other 2+hrs hunting with a mini raid party (9 of us in all) pulling as fast as i could and no eldrig to be found.

oh well.  ill keep pluggin away at it until i get his guts.

well, we are getting closer.  tonight was an other miss, but we finnaly did find the PH and get it killed so we just had to camp the spawn point.

FYI for those who have not done this camp yet a 56 bard with the 'Song of Highsun' is almost mandatory.  this song gates mob back to spawn point, debuffs them 1 time, stuns them 1 time, and causes agro.

what we did tonight was send the 61 level bard off towards BW zone to start SoH mobs.  every time he told me he was gating mob id run over to the spawn point.  we had the rest of the group near there.  just a tad south of the spawn point.

once there was a mob there i soloed it with my nec as the group had 2 mobs already at the camp.  we then moved down to the spawn point and after 2+hrs had no Eldrig the Old to kill so i am here telling all this so i can go to bed.

fyi  the spawn timmer is not static.  at times he spawned at 13min, others at 15min, but it was always between those 2 time frames the PH spawned.

i plan on heading back to SF again tomorrow.  we need to kill Eldrig 2 times.  once for me, and the other for Bedio (the 61st bard in my guild) who has been working with me to get the guts.  we are both now at the same point in our epic.

We took down Trak last wed night, the 7th, textbook kill, dropped him in under 2 minutes and entire operation, organizing and gettind down to his lair, killing him and getting everyone rezzed and out too under 20 minutes, I was pretty happy considering we somehow managed to wipe last time around.  He dropped the guts and a Deepwater Breastplate for some lucky Paladin Alt since all our paladin mains already have better.  

Did all the hand ins an and got the Singing Short Sword then knocked out some flags.  We killed Airen'Dar, Agnarr and did the Hedge Maze... sad I stil haven't done the PoJ trials and I have all but one piece for the PoStorms quest.

Been doing a lot of LDoN's lately as well, got the Malevolent Greaves of Suffering from Everfrost, 44ac 8sta 8cha and some other nice stats and I'm about 5 or 6 wins from the Royal Attendant's Breastplate from Tak... it's nice suddently not having to worry about cash, I have just about all the gear I want to buy and now most improvements to my gear are all No Drop items :)

Fear raids are usually one of two things.  A lot of fun, or annoying as hell.  Assuming you break in right it's a ton of fun but if it goes badly on entry you're screwed, it's not exactly easy to do a naked corpse retrieval since there's no real good place to recoup unless you're able to clear up some of the entrance mobs.  We need to go back and get the golem for a friend of mine's wizard epic soon.

Fear can be a bitch...especially if it's fully populated.  Worst fear raid started out beautifully.  1 death upon breaking in, which is a good thing.  Halfway through our raid, the zone repopped for no reason whatsoever.  Massive TRW.  It was so bad, all the melee were dressed and mostly equipped with summoned armor and weapons.  However, we had a successful CR even with being so underequipped.
