We all know about casinos I'm sure and how they are always ripping people off.  Well the other day a guy shouted out that he was holding a raffle.  The more tickets you bought the better your chances of winning.  Each ticket cost 1k.  Now I know thats an absurd price but this guy was saying all these 20k items you could win and when I asked him to show me them just to make sure he really had them and wasn't just search linking.  Well he really had them!  Anyways several people got interested.  Most of the people that entered the "raffle" bought around 2-3 tickets.  One idiot bought 7 but anyways, he then proceded to the bank after everyone had given him the cash for the raffle without saying who won or even rolling for that matter.  He then proceded to make take all the gear off of his character (I'm guessing he put it in a bag) and went LD.  My guess is he stuck all the plat and gear into the bank and deleted hs character since I never heard of him again and the GM couldn't trace him when I petitioned.  But anyways I'm just warning all of you to be cautious when entering a "raffle"

How about...never give anyone anything w/o something in return.

It's ridiculously stupid to give someone any coin and press trade w/o anything being on his side of the trade window.

It would be impossible to rip you off in a casino type scam, if you put the money up in the window but didn't hit trade.  Then random, if you lose press trade, if you win wait for him to put your winnings up plus whatever you have up (or just cancel and have him give you the winnings).

If they won't do that, then they are a scammer.
