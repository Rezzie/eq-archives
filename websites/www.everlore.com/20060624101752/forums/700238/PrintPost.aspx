Im stuck on either playing a beastlord or mage. I have this limited thinking that only good mages are is for CoH and beastlords are for spiritual line. What do you all think would be better high end for raid type situations?

well, id day go with the beastlord class. for one, we can melee very well, have the use of some very nice weapons at mid-high lvls (some even nice at low lvls), and we can absorb dmg more than mages. dont get me wrong though, mages are great (have a 34 mage), but at higher lvls you want a pet class that will be able to take some dmg from mobs before pet takes back agro. plus side to mages are incredible pets with even better abilities for each type, insane nukes (at least i think they are insane, but hey, i never use nuke spells with my bst, hehe), as you mentioned CoH spell, and at higher lvls the spells to summon pet gear. they dont get many beneficial spells like bst's do (although the shielding spells are awesome), they usually dont need any seeing as how pet really does most of the work on a mob, and about 55-60% of the time in a group with a buffer. as for raids, mages are an excellent class because their pets can do some pretty good dmg, (they hit a lot harder than bst pets from what i can tell), and they can nuke for a lot at high lvls, but bst's can somewhat buff a raid group with the spiritual spells, and their pets can do some good dmg as well as well as the bst getting in there and meleeing and DoTing and nuking. well, hopefully this info helps you on your class decision, good luck.

Well I am a fan of both Mages and BL's but a comparison between the two is very difficult. I have a 53 mage but have not played a BL. BL's and mages are on the top of my list for DPS in grind groups and mages ARE GREAT IN RAIDS. Not sure why Konsh is comparing MAge and BEast taking damage. As a pet class at higher levels you don't want to take damage, that is for the MA to take. He also says mages don't get many useful spells at higher levels, I disagree.

Mages have insane DPS with pet, nukes, Damage Sheilds and focus items given to others.

In raids my mage is VERY useful, I contribute huge amounts of damage even at lvl 53. I am also a walking general store that helps our raid a ton. Before raid I will summon arrows, higher level mages summon great pet gear, summon throwing weapons for our pullers, summon focus items that our nukers use which increases damage a lot. Eye of Zomm is hugely beneficial. Mod rods are also very helpful.

Point is both of these clsses are great DPS classes. If you like melee types more take BL. If you like caster classes and standing out because you are so helpful on raids and in grind groups play a mage.

I would really focus around the caster and melee type and what you would rather play. Again, both classes are excellent and I love to have Bth of them in grind groups for DPS, top of my list in the planes for DPS.

guess i forgot that mages summon some great focus effect items and other items for people on raids. also, your right about the spells jobeker, mages get great spells at higher lvls (im gonna like using arch shielding and phantom plate). i only included the taking dmg part in because sometimes when in groups or raids your spells (esp. my DoT spells) get me unwanted agro, which is sometimes what happens with my mage and his nukes, so i thought it wouldve been useful to add it in there.

I can tell you from experience with my mage is great.  I am 65 and can pretty much group with just about anyone and be a very vital part of the group.  Yes bst may out melee a mage but you have to figure what is more powerful a melee hit or a spell?...  Well it is obvious my choice was made from lvl 1 that I wanted a mage.  For I was always told and still believe that a spell caster can out damage the best of any melee class in the game.  That means a war with 8k+ hps and 1500+ def 1800+ atk may seem intimidating but thank of a mage that can kill him in about 5 spells, for example debuff resist fire cold and magic, then cast 4 firebolts of tallon and well he will be well done.( I think that is the name of the spell heh)  
Do not get me wrong I have seen some the the greatest players be bst and I group with them all the time.  They have great buffs and can help tank sometimes, but it all boils down to what you as a player prefer.  Casting with pet duo, or melee pet duo.  heh like the guy said before me.

Well thank you for hearing my part wow I think I wrote too much.

Corenium 59mag,

  Ok, BL get more action cause they can melee in a group. But- as you know, in high level I would'nt let a BL take dmg , They can take more then a mag for sure but still to think a mob can hit for 500 will make the diffrance between lasting 5sec of aggro or 1sec . In that case I preffer my mage - I just don't get aggro, thats all... just remember the rules :) dont nuke b4 the mob's hp are 85% or less and if u want u can use aggro reduction items (summoned by mages) and even get a AA that reduce aggro from us.

They all said it, BL are still great..btw we make a great partners (BL+Mag).

Last point, its not the class u play - Its how you play it ! (accept Nec's LOL)
