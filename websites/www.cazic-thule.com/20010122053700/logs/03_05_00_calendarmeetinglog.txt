<Oaklandbash> no, we stated we are not calling it law
<Manorien{AoW}> ok

<Sabre> yes.. agreed.. :I.. 
<Thornsong> They left Hate at the appropriate time to let the Relentless move in
<Oaklandbash> well, some sure use it as a holy crusade and claim it is hte law, we don't bleieve that under the current system
<kodi> thornieee!
<Oaklandbash> as we said we would Thorn
<Thornsong> I had no doubts
<Thornsong> Hey Kodi
<Taloz-KoWW> not law, but it should be followed unless theres a good reason not to
<Oaklandbash> how have your drops been?  I think we jsut got ridiculously lucky 2 days out of the 5
<Thornsong> 2 warriors arms and tons of cleric items -- that be it
<Oaklandbash> we got 4 cleric BPs which was nice
<Thornsong> we got a couple
<Sabre> how much people can java chat handle? 32 or more?
<Drakyn_EA> lol. The rest of the classes except Shaman, cleric and Bard all sucked though
<Oaklandbash> we got 2 rogue BPs, warriro BP, 4 cleric BPs, shaman BP in the days we were there, but not ONE single mage or enchanter drop

<Manorien{AoW}> we saw enchanter legs and no mage drops in our week there

<Oaklandbash> you get the GM to make you the Italian Wifebeater shirt yet ;)
<ShadeStorm> heh, she has beaten me
<Oaklandbash> how?
<Oaklandbash> not legit, not possible
<Kodi-AoW> thats no excuse to kill her
<ShadeStorm> keep dueling
<Oaklandbash> I beat her melee only no buffs or spells alone ;)
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<ShadeStorm> 5-6 times in a row with np hps and barely any mana
*** Korelin has joined #CTC
*** Thornsong has joined #CTC
<ShadeStorm> only thing that saves my butt against any melee is my fireshield
<Behemoth> and lag shade =p
<Oaklandbash> well, having over 900ac helps as a shaman, hehe
<ShadeStorm> although behemoth i wasnt daring to let him melee me and get off a process
<Kodi-AoW> theres a time and place for punk music
<Oaklandbash> Behemoth you over 1050 yet?
<Kodi-AoW> and 6.30 isnt it
*** Nekoj has quit IRC (Signed Off)
*** Nekoj has joined #CTC
<Drakyn_EA> Heh. I hear that Shade..
<ShadeStorm> bah, zerin even found out i dont see in a single place when a duel starts
<Behemoth> i havent tried recently, i think i can get 1050 AC though i may need to borrow a Bladestopper
<Oaklandbash> just ask to use mine if you want
<Behemoth> up to 924 base AC 
<Oaklandbash> I can't believe mages are getting freakin Malosi now
<Manorien{AoW}> i cant believe rangers are getting ensnare
<Manorien{AoW}> lol
<Taloz-KoWW> WOOH!
*** Talzok has joined #CTC
<ShadeStorm> yea, kills the shaman, long live the mage ;>
<Oaklandbash> but shamans get Avatar, I cant wait to use taht spell
<Oaklandbash> mages are also getting Malo
<Drakyn_EA> lol Oak. Stop bitchin will ya? ;p
<Oaklandbash> neg 40 all resists no resist check made
<Oaklandbash> hehe
<Manorien{AoW}> wow
<Thornsong> what is Avatar
<Behemoth> I wonder if Warriors will get anything new besides the highest skill caps =) i cant wait for 252 offence with 240 1hs oh and bind wound to 210 
<Drakyn_EA> You know mages aren't gonna jack all else for decent spells
<Aracnakat> Evil Clerics should get the opposite of Rez .. we should be Death Touch ;pp
<Manorien{AoW}> thats like the one rougue posison
<ShadeStorm> still have yet to see our dd's or our bolts or fire shields
<Oaklandbash> 100str 100dex 100ATK 25% growth
<Oaklandbash> but its like 1400mana or something ridiculous
<Drakyn_EA> I'm not very hopefull Shade..
<ShadeStorm> i am
<Taloz-KoWW> I bet mage get 1500+ bold
<Drakyn_EA> They have pretty much jacked us around on every other spell we got
<Taloz-KoWW> bold=bolt
<Thornsong> And not get res Aracknat?
<Oaklandbash> what is a wizzies highest DD supposed to be now?
<Kodi-AoW> necros are gonna get stupid spells id say too.. too many people complain about our "power"
<Oaklandbash> from expansion
<ShadeStorm> no clue
*** Talzok is now known as Talzok_TEB
<Behemoth> Drakyn look at the difference from a level 39 pet to a 49 pet, then imagine a 59 pet
<Oaklandbash> SKs are getting level 44 necro pets
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Behemoth> I am hoping for like 5k base hps at 60 ;p
<Drakyn_EA> I doubt they will be giving out any new pets. Nothing on the necro list for pets yet
<Manorien{AoW}> palis get reso and 49 res
<Oaklandbash> Paladins are getting Resurection, Resolution, Shield of Words, Superior heal
<Kodi-AoW> your joking? the level 44 pet is a machine!
<Ezamin> that 49 res thing was a surprise to me
<Mythral-CN> may get Oak, those list aren't definite yet
<Manorien{AoW}> yes there is new pets
<Taloz-KoWW> Super heal is the big one
<Behemoth> the list is not complete by any means
<Taloz-KoWW> and res is nice
<Manorien{AoW}> clerics are getting group CH hehe
<Thornsong> Shamans dont get superior heal do they?
<Taloz-KoWW> not yet
<Drakyn_EA> I'm waiting to see it before I launch any complaints. I'm just not all that hopefull
*** Kalorn has joined #CTC
<Ezamin> aye with effect removal as well
<Aracnakat> Manorien .. I didn't see a Group CH??
<Oaklandbash> but shamans are looking to get AE togors, that will be NICE
<Taloz-KoWW> its the level 60 spell
<Korelin> the 10000 hp heal
<Taloz-KoWW> heals 10K 
<Behemoth> its a group 10k hps heal not exactly complete heal but close 
<Ezamin> its right up there
<Behemoth> costs like 1000 mana though
<Aracnakat> 10 split between the entire group?
<Aracnakat> 10k I mean
<Korelin> yea Kat
<Kodi-AoW> kodi thinks necros should get resurect, dual wield, double attack, lay of hands and harm touch
<Aracnakat> Very cool! :)
<Ezamin> ket we shall rule =)
<Aracnakat> I just hope ... HOPE .. that the raise skill caps ;x
*** Kalorn has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Aracnakat> the = they
<Taloz-KoWW> theres skill cap numbers around to
<Ezamin> ket =kat
*** Kalorn has joined #CTC
<Oaklandbash> Togor's gets nerfed with out STR buff next patch =(
<Behemoth> Im happy looking at my skill cap numbers, i will have attack near a monk
<Taloz-KoWW> Rangers are gonna die in expansion, our defense is staying at level 40 levels
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<ShadeStorm> rangers die now
<Taloz-KoWW> capped at 200
<Taloz-KoWW> gonna die worse lol
<Ezamin> if they want to do something effective they should make some worthwhile lvl 50 quests to get people out of dungeons
<Kalorn> rangers always die :)
<Kodi-AoW> oak, you hippy.. what're you changing your name to?
<Oaklandbash> nah, new shaman spell is like 80% slowdown, no one will die ;)
<ShadeStorm> i made gruden have to heal jacek, lawerian, and rayzor in the same group one time....i was being mean
<Taloz-KoWW> ROFL
<Oaklandbash> hehe, just not playing when hte GMs are on ;)
<Behemoth> What i want to know is.... since our skills all capped out at level 40... the day we get the expansion will we be able to go to the top for skill?
<Ezamin> ROFL shade
<Kodi-AoW> ezamin: then people will camp the quest spawns
<Aracnakat> Good question Behemoth :)
<Taloz-KoWW> probably capped per level, just like before, I'm guessing but that would be consistent
<Oaklandbash> I wonder if tanks are going to get 200hp per level or something
<Aracnakat> Who here right now is at the Texas Gathering??  Celestriel?
<Oaklandbash> they cant hope to only get 40 per level like they do now
<Behemoth> Warriors get hps bonus at certain levels like 40 or 45 now so i cant wait for the 55 bonus
<Celestriel-CN> No, I didn't go =)
<Kalorn> would be nice to get a decent hp increase per level since the new spells are gonna add so much :)
<Celestriel-CN> They're having lotsa fun though =)
<Aracnakat> Oh no :( .. I know they were looking forward to meeting you .. :)
<Korelin> agreed Kalorn
<Kodi-AoW> hmm.. behemoth.. i thought you were a rogue.. lol
<Kalorn> mind you going make twinking newbies a riot - imagine lvl 1 newbies with 1500 hps :)
<Korelin> uhm lol
<Taloz-KoWW> LOL Kodi
<Ezamin> ali lives in texas he'll be on soon
<Aracnakat> A Rogue named THE CHAMPION? -hehe- :)
<Oaklandbash> I have a pic of Behemoth in full crafted in the PoF I just dug up
<Kalorn> at least shamans get group buffs now :)
<Kodi-AoW> hey, if people think im a druid behemoth can be a rogue
<Behemoth> nope no rogue here.. i can deal AND take damage =p
<Oaklandbash> bah, shamans are getting screwed, who you kidding, hehe
<Aracnakat> Aye .. thank god .. same with clerics Kalorn :)
*** Tekno has joined #CTC
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Oaklandbash> druids geting group fire and cold reisst is REAL handy for dragons
<Aracnakat> Although I had hoped for group resistes like Magic, Cold, Fire etc.
<Korelin> aye Oak
*** Galar has joined #CTC
*** orun has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> Ahhh .. Druids are getting them .. cool :)
<Tekno> if it was +60 maybe oak =)
<Behemoth> bah with the expansion Vox and Nag will be obsolete, and never know what the new Dragons are gonna do... heard a rumor that Veeshan is not on Sky but on Kunark
<Taloz-KoWW> They should make the druid group resists higher like enchanter resist magic
<Oaklandbash> nah, it is so easy to get 150 for any resist
<Aracnakat> Are the spellcaster lists out yet?
<Manorien{AoW}> the shaman potions are nice
<Oaklandbash> potions are nice, but with AE diepell not really
<Celestriel-CN> preliminary lists, yes, Kat
<orun> ae dispell is the devil.
*** Vaziel-ID has joined #CTC
<Vaziel-ID> Vendui all
<Aracnakat> Cool .. I"ll have to jump over to Castersrealms and check them out :)
<Aracnakat> Vendui' Vaziel :)
*** Duira has joined #CTC
<Mythral-CN> Vendui
<Behemoth> I am not sure if they will buff Vox or Nagafen because im pretty sure their loot will be junk compared to some Kunark items
<Duira> Vendui
*** Kalorn is now known as Kalorn-Albion
<Oaklandbash> casstersrealm has real bad descriptions of the spells
<Ezamin> oh and kodi as far as camping quest spawns they can make the quests a little more intricate meaning more traveling less killing sure you throw in a few tough mobs along they way, but bt them in zones like tox forrest or innothule and make them indifferent, make people go to the unused zones
<Manorien{AoW}> i cant wait for the expansion, when is paineel supposed to be ouyt?
<Aracnakat> I believe that I've heard that Vox, Nag, & the Gods will ALWAYS be buffed in accordance with the level of the game
<Taloz-KoWW> true oak
<Oaklandbash> your better off going to the class specific sites to get the spell descriptions
<Manorien{AoW}> i mean the hole
<Vaziel-ID> they've yet to say Manorien
<Oaklandbash> BTW, what is hte big deal about Rangers getting ensnare?  I read on the druid board that a bunch of druids are pissed about taht
<Taloz-KoWW> The cat people kerra isle needs to be made 40+
<Taloz-KoWW> ROFL 
<Manorien{AoW}> lol
*** Duira has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Taloz-KoWW> I don't want ensnare
<Manorien{AoW}> ensnare will never get memmed
<Taloz-KoWW> give me something good
<Aracnakat> About 10 more minutes .... I'm going afk to potty .. get a drink ... give Del a smooch :)
<Manorien{AoW}> snare is just as good
<Behemoth> its funny how much Vox has changed from the first time she was ever killed to now, i bet 6 planes gear people could kill the very original vox
* orun uses level 1 snare
<Drakyn_EA> Thump him on the head for me Kat ;)
*** Duira has joined #CTC
<Oaklandbash> Behemoth with 12 they could do it with EASE, 6 would be too hard
<Oaklandbash> back then you could fully resist the cold and fear with ease
<orun> ct needs a split. ;0
<Manorien{AoW}> i really hope we dont get extinguish fatigue, i dont think i will be casting that too much either
<Vaziel-ID> Vendui
<Manorien{AoW}> and chloro over regen
<Vaziel-ID> Duira heh

<Korelin> hehe Behe =)
<Kodi-AoW> haha
<Taloz-KoWW> lol
<Oaklandbash> a level 60 SK with a 44necro pet and Soul Leach is a soloing machine
<Taloz-KoWW> and cascading darkness
<Taloz-KoWW> !
<Aliudyen-DA> Why would a level 60 Sk want to solo though
<Manorien{AoW}> so what is the farthest anyone has gotten in sky
<Mythral-CN> I wanna see the definitive spell list before making any judgement tho
<Manorien{AoW}> umm farm items in sol a i guess
<Vaziel-ID> they will nerf SK's somehow before release of expansion
<Vaziel-ID> same here Mythral
<Taloz-KoWW> With those spells they could farm lguk
<Oaklandbash> yeah, with ease
* Galar panics at the sight of the word "nerf"
<orun> with expansion i hope it to be comparable to the death beatles in Unrest when you were level 15.
*** Nahalen has joined #CTC
*** Karn has joined #CTC
*** Rieur_Albion has joined #CTC
<Oaklandbash> I want to know how they really plan on doing mobs, there is no way they can have 3 PoF mobs in the King room in SolB and hope to have 1 group do them
*** Guest192 has joined #CTC
*** Nataka has joined #CTC
<Vaziel-ID> from how it looks there are no plans to alter current zones and monsters, they will simply add new ones
<Taloz-KoWW> Yes, the expansion really needs to get back to letting a single group do things...
<Manorien{AoW}> i guess you will have to see how the new levels effect classes
<Manorien{AoW}> what it lets you do and what it doesnt
<Manorien{AoW}> i agree
*** Nataka has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Thornsong> I think they should put wandering photoplasms in Kerra Ridge -- would make that zone awesome
<Manorien{AoW}> lol 
<Manorien{AoW}> hell yes

<Aliudyen-DA> Well you posted an Agree/disagree thing in the rules
*** Kenji-Cohort has joined #CTC
<Aliudyen-DA> if there are 10 members from guild x how many agree/disagree's do we need
<Nahalen-R> i think he means, how many votes does each guild get?
<Aracnakat> -nods- Aye .. but everyone needs to be able to give a vote ... we want this to be an individual vote .. not a guild vote
*** Kodi-AoW is now known as Kodi-personal
<Kodi-personal> im representing myself
<Aracnakat> -nods- I see where he's coming from .. but individual votes will count .. regardless if they are here with/as a guild
*** Straylite-EA has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> Because we do have people here who are unguilded and we must have a way to allow everyone the ability to vote
*** Kenji-Cohort has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Drucilla> Then larger guilds may get represented disproportionally.
<Straylite-EA> Daddy's home.
<Aliudyen-DA> Yes all unguilded would be able to vote i would assume

<Vaziel-ID> Vendui' Kenji
<Kenji-Cohort> Hello
<Aracnakat> I see what you are saying Dru and Ali, but ... some people vote as individuals and do not follow the path of the others ... I've always been guilded .. and follow my heart, not what my guild says to follow ect .. lets see how it pans out .. everyone okay with that?
<Infestalia> I am concerned with voting here as there is such a small proportion of people here to those that will be effected
<Nataka> My concerns exactly Inf
<Duira_AP> same
<Tekno> lets not coutn votes then and just hear otu what people have to say and their concerns?
<Talzok_TEB> ditto
<Nataka> we represent about one half of one percent of our server
<Drucilla> Well the word was out on this meeting, so I think we have to assume that if people didn't show, we can't really know what their concerns are or hold off on voting.
*** Curufin has joined #CTC
<Flareon> Yea... any one of the large guilds could call thier people here to tip the vote in thier favor, and it wouldn't be reprsentative of the server as a whole.
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> One at a time please ....
<Taloz-KoWW> que me
<Infestalia> que me
<Aracnakat> Okay ... how should we do the "voting" then? .. I want to make sure that small guilds and individuals get a BIG say in this as well as everyone else
<Kodi-personal> its queue
<Drucilla> Could we a) let individuals vote for themselves, and b) give each guild one vote?
<Aracnakat> Que Ali .. speak
*** Lenya is now known as Darious-SS
<Aracnakat> Durcilla .. please
<Drucilla> (sorry)
*** Bayn has joined #CTC
<Kodi-personal> you should be!
<Talzok_TEB> I feel voting is in essence irrelevant
*** Tikiri has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> Talzok .. please wait to be called into que
<Aliudyen-DA> Maybe denote one person to vote per guild (unless there is a disagreement in guild) and have individuals be able to log a vote for themselves
<Talzok_TEB> que me then
<Squaw> i agree
<Aracnakat> (NOTE: When you are done .. please type /done) (Talzok, you are qued)
<clean-kordak-EA> Que ME

<Kodi-personal> lol stray
<Darious-SS> heh cue me baby
<Infestalia> ?

*** Moonraider has joined #CTC
<Kodi-personal> lol

*** Kodi-personal is now known as KODi
<Aracnakat> Infestalia ?
*** behfiredrilldoh is now known as Behemoth-CN
<Infestalia> my question on current topic is whether we can bash out ideas here and vote on ctc
<KODi> how? in irc its a unknown command
<Aracnakat> Then type "I'm done"
<KODi> queue me

<Aracnakat> Drucilla ?
<Drucilla> As to Ali's suggestion -- I was wondering how we could possibly hope to mediate inter-guild disagreement in this forum... seems well beyond the scope of what we could hope to do.
<Omalley-RK> ?
<Tishla_VG> queue mw please
*** Korelin is now known as Korelin-SS
<Tullus> dont tell me you werent smart enough to setup a question bot..
*** Angturil has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> Ali, did you want to respond to Drucilla .. or should we hold that until we discuss Infests' suggestion?
*** Galar is now known as Galar-SS
<Aracnakat> Tullus .. I'm not smart enough
*** Ailnydar-RP has joined #CTC
<Tullus> okay
<KODi> this isnt working
<Tullus> just making sure
<KODi> get a gm to set a server vote, im sure if they realised we were trying to solve things ourselves theyd be happy at not having to work
<KODi> now im going
<KODi> 7.30am, im damn tired
* KODi falls over
<Aliudyen-DA> Its not our job to mediate interguild disagreements but if say....Jacek disagrees with Sharniken then he could vote
<Aracnakat> Bye Kodi :)
<Drucilla> as an indpendent you mean?
<Aliudyen-DA> yes
<Tekno> ?

*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Omalley-RK> while it is true that not evey1 is here and can see what is going on
<Sharniken> if you have an inner guild disagreement you should have a guild vote and then only post one vote here
*** Angturil has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Omalley-RK> we are the ones whop have taken it upon ourselves to try to get something done

<Aracnakat> -nods-
<Omalley-RK> and we all know that something needs to be decided
<kodi-sleep> queue dammit~!
<Taloz-KoWW> agreed, omalley and sharn both
<Aracnakat> Tekno ?
<Tekno> Lets just not waste time on voting and get to the real subject at hand . 53 people cannot represent a whole server and how everyone feels so its not going to mean much even if we do vote on it. thats just imo
<Aracnakat> Clean ?
<Tishla_VG> ?
<Omalley-RK> so i think that we should not worry about upsetting others aand if they have concerns they can bring them up later...done
<clean-kordak-EA> ok
<Aracnakat> (sorry Omally, thought you were done) :)
<Omalley-RK> np;)
<clean-kordak-EA> heh, this isnt on subject but where are the logs available? =)
<clean-kordak-EA> the channel logs
<Aracnakat> Since the meeting isn't over, there are no logs yet, they will be availabel on the CTC for everyone

<Aracnakat> -nods- I see both points ... and we'll get back to your suggestion as soon as these questions are done :)

<Tishla_VG> I rep 76 people from my guild. So, what I need to know is, do I need to get everyone from my guild to flood this with a vote... or are we doing a 1 vote per guild

<Aracnakat> Good question Tishla .. and it's one that obviously currently trying to be exploited as we see one guild in particular flooding in here ;x
<Drakyn_EA> Who is that Kat?
<Aracnakat> I think that we are going to need to do something ...
*** Xandrea|EQ is now known as Xandrea|TY
<Tishla_VG> Our guild already desided who would be the rep and go by whatever decision based on what was said....
<Aracnakat> Either .. 1 vote per guild -OR- as Infest has requested .. NO VOTING
<Aracnakat> -nods- I understand Tishla, and this is a serious concern on your part :)
*** Staylor has joined #CTC
<Taloz-KoWW> 1 per guild, or not much gets done.
*** Thornsong has joined #CTC
<Tikiri> Im not representing my guild here today..  Im representing myself
<Aracnakat> Okie .. we'll discuss this
<Moonraider> why not try all the issues people have with the calander be brought up today, then everyone goes away talks about it in thier guilds and then have 1 rep come back in a few days with any comments votes relating to those topics mentioned?
<Xandrea|TY> I agree 1 vote per guild.
<Tishla_VG> agreed. If we do not have one vote per guild, we aqre going to get flooded here.
*** Staylor is now known as Staylor-SS
<Aracnakat> Last question on this topic: Drucilla ?
<Xader> And those who arent guilded?
<Taloz-KoWW> I agree with Moonraiders idea LOTS
<Drucilla> I was just wondering what happened with the last meeting -- is this how the last batch of rules got decided?
<Aracnakat> Unguilded will get a say
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<clean-kordak-EA> Kat, we are a bit out of order here.. cue not being followed and ? being used for comments..
<Aracnakat> No Drucilla .. there really weren't any "rules" in the last meeting .. I was trying to get us some control over this meeting which is why I set these "rules"
<Tishla_VG> agreed.. unguilded get a vote...  i vote per guild. /done
*** arieck_ss has joined #CTC
<Drucilla> No no no, I mean the calendar rules, one slot per month, Fri-Sun, M-Thurs -- those rules.
<Aracnakat> Okie ... I'm going to make a decision because I can see what's happening here ...
*** Tikiri is now known as Tikiri-EA
<Xandrea|TY> Ok Kat
<Aracnakat> Oh ... those rules were voted on by all who were in attendance at the last meeting
<Thornsong> Yes Drucilla they were decided here
<clean-kordak-EA> use +m and +v for who is up.. and use /msg for que's
<Drucilla> Okay, yeah, that was my question.  So it seems there is already a precident...
<Aracnakat> (Clean, I don't know how to do that :(_)
<clean-kordak-EA> doh
<clean-kordak-EA> heh
<Aracnakat> Wish I did ;x
*** Bhulak has joined #CTC
<clean-kordak-EA> want me to msg you a list of commands
<Aracnakat> Okie ... I'm going to allow everyone to vote on this ONE issue ...
<clean-kordak-EA> maybe for future refference
<Aracnakat> Vote for either 1 or 2 (please do Clean)
*** Scytheiea has joined #CTC
<clean-kordak-EA> k
<clean-kordak-EA> ill make one
<Aracnakat> 1) Each guild/Individual gets one vote per topic
*** Bhulak is now known as Bhulak-SS
<Aracnakat> 2) We have no voting here but discussions which will be posted on the CTC for actual voting
<Aracnakat> Please vote now for either 1 or 2

<Manorien{AoW}> or they want something acomplished today, but i voted 2
* Tishla_VG hit the wrong key, changes vote to 2
<replay-SS> good assumption, but the rest of this server knows that there was supposed to be a discussion of this
<Xandrea|TY> People are free to vote here, Im thinking the long threads the bueraucracy
<Aracnakat> 1's = 22 votes
<Tikiri-EA> Actually no they dont Replay
<clean-kordak-EA> 2
<Xandrea|TY> blah blah blah, you know 1 is alot simpler and gets alot more crud done.
<Darious-SS> ?
<Infestalia> ? no rest of server that reads ctc replay
*** Xader has joined #CTC
<Tikiri-EA> this server does not revolve around EA / SS etc
<replay-SS> there was mention of another time togethre to resolve this
<Aracnakat> Lovely .. 2's = 22 votes LOL
<Tikiri-EA> and not all of them knew about this meeting
<replay-SS> where did i say EA / SS? this is about CTC
<Nataka> replay how could they? I didnt even know about this calender until it was a done deal
<Tikiri-EA> I was throwing out examples
<Talzok_TEB> did you count clean?
<Nekoj> Hold let me log on a couple more chat windows under different names to change the vote :-p
<Mythral-CN> please Tik and Rep go to tells
<replay-SS> CTC.  and if #2 is used, it's still posted on CTC, is it really different, nataka?
<Taloz-KoWW> I suggest voting here, 1 per guild, no independants, this is much more about guilds than soloers
<replay-SS> that's true, taloz
<Tikiri-EA> Well Actually There was no 3rd option..  we were given only 2 choices
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
*** Eumen has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> What was the 3rd option?
<Duira_AP> que me
*** Eumen is now known as Eumen-SS
<Drucilla> and it seems a little cheesy that people ar switching to "independents" even though they're in a guild so they get a vote
<Tikiri-EA> There was no 3rd option
*** Squaw has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<ShadeStorm> revote then
<Darious-SS> cue me plz
<Aracnakat> Don't worry Drucilla, I won't allow that
<Manorien{AoW}> perhaps they couldnt make it here replay due to work or RL stuff, but could find time to post on CTC
<Moonraider> no , if you dont allow the no guilded people to vote your calander means nothing they too pay to play and just because they choose not to be in a guild doesnt mean they dont get a say, btw im EA ;p~
<Aracnakat> You are in Que Darious
<Duira_AP> arac doh
<replay-SS> so you wan soloers to have a heavy a count as an entire guild, moon?
<Xandrea|TY> Thats why Kat asked to send a rep for each guild Man.
<replay-SS> manorien: can someone in their guild speak for the guild then?
<Taloz-KoWW> No unguilded person is going to run a plane or dragon run, or at least its very unlikely
<Tekno> its one thing to let the non guilded people to vote that are of level. but any level player can then vote if its 2
<ShadeStorm> im switching to 2 btw
<ShadeStorm> tie broken ;>
<Aracnakat> Not so Taloz .. they can in fact gather other unguilded people and do it
<Xandrea|TY> Im thinking we can either get things DONE today, via number 1 vote, or, vote 2 and get things done in a few weeks.
<Straylite> I never voted.  1.
<Xandrea|TY> now see the problem with a few weeks, is that, the big problem is the crowding now
<Drakyn_EA> I didn't vote Sharn so I could tie it again based on what I feel best
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Duira_AP> que me
<Xandrea|TY> isnt that why we are all at eachothers throats for everything?
<Taloz-KoWW> I have seen such attempts, they don't work without a guild in charge.
<replay-SS> Aye, whether it gets voted on here by us, or gets voted in CTC, it'll still be a mess.
<Xandrea|TY> Sorry Kat.
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Taloz-KoWW> oops
<Aracnakat> Okie .. we're getting nothing accoplished here ;x
-Korelin-SS- check out private message
<Moonraider> NONE of us own this server even the little people deserve the right to have thier say on this issue since it does effect them also
<clean-kordak-EA> Kat, can you read the /msg's to Kat?
<Moonraider> that was in response to ya replay ;>
<clean-kordak-EA> or just aracnakat
<Tekno> how does it affect a level 5?
<replay-SS> that's the easy way out of it, moon.  
<Aracnakat> I'm going to allow Korelin to moderate this event, because I can't do it .... too many people speaking ..
*** Aracnakat: you're not channel operator
<Aracnakat> NM .. I can't do it ;x
<Moonraider> i am talking about people who can actively hunt in the planes
<Aracnakat> hold one second .. telephone ;x
*** Tritolus has joined #CTC
<Straylite> You are the channel op.  You can moderate the shit out of this channel if you wanted to.
<clean-kordak-EA> kat
<Tikiri-EA> If people would have just a little curtosy and some respect for others we wouldn't even be here right now
<Nataka> ok I have just one thing to say then I will be out of your hair please just listen I am next in que anyway
*** Tritolus is now known as Tritolus-SS
<Kenji-Cohort> Any chance we could restrict this to officers and unguilded folks?
<replay-SS> Heh, imperfect people in an imperfect world, it's not gonna happen.  We're just trying our best to put something together.
<Moonraider> everyone is always so quick to screw over the little people. i know a guild who has 1 lvl 50 and is the only one who can go to planes from his guild should he not get a say because he isnt in a large guild?
<Nataka> The calender makes this game into a job, You have to be at a certain place at a certain time, or your team suffers. Some people have lives that they can not just shut off to play a game(I myself put in a lot of time, although not nearly as much as others)I play every spare moment I come across, and I can not say when that moment will be.
<Tishla_VG> agreed Kenji. good idea
<Lejes_Rimul-SS> Moon but that guild can not do PoF even...
<Nataka> Until someone other than myself pays for my time in my game, they will not tell me where and when I can be.
<Nataka> And the final problem I have with the calender, is that, The 8 or 10 guilds who have taken this to gospel do not even come close to representing the several hundred if not thousand guilds on our server.
<Nataka> So those are the reasons I am and will always be totally opposed to the calender.
<Nataka> Now onto the reason for the existence of the calender. 
<Nataka> Our server (yes and all the rest as well) is Way ov
<Moonraider> no i dont agree with Kenji this affects me and i would at least enjoy having my say :)
*** Bhulak has joined #CTC
<Mythral-CN> yeah let only officers and unguilded speak... that will restrict traffic
<clean-kordak-EA> Why are you people so goddamn disrespectful? Why cant you just not talk unless qued
<replay-SS> moon: no one limitd it to some vague description of "large guild" only gettting to vote.
*** ShadeStorm sets mode: +o Korelin-SS
<Lejes_Rimul-SS> How so?
<clean-kordak-EA> i dont get it
<Korelin-SS> there, now we can moderate this
<Lejes_Rimul-SS> you can't even do PoF
<Kenji-Cohort> As much and I enjoy Moon and Nataka.  EA officers need to speak for them
<Drucilla> I'm also here representing an alliance of very small guilds, and I believe that with the group assembled here today, FAIR guildlines can be agreed upon.
*** Bhulak has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
*** Korelin-SS sets mode: +o Aracnakat
<Vaziel-ID> Then have your say to your guild officers Moon
<replay-SS> :zips his lips
<Darious-SS> its not about who can and cant do a plane or a dragon
<Nataka> I am NOT EA
<Drucilla> Hey, my guild can't do a plane, but me and 3 other guilds together can, which makes what happens here of great importance to me.
<Moonraider> Kenji im sorry but i have a voice and i would like to have my opinions stated by me :)
<Xandrea|TY> Nat is Doi r?
<Korelin-SS> Kat will inform me of what she needs done
<Nataka> I am TEB
<Kenji-Cohort> We're not goingto accomplish anything with all this static
<Xandrea|TY> swicth your /nick to /nick Nataka|TEB
<Moonraider> Seriously no disrespect to anyone but if i have to deguild just so i can speak for myself i will

<Tikiri-EA> They may or maynot reflect those of the guild I am an officer of
<Sharniken> if your in a guild , your own vote means nothing do to the fact your not even gone be doing any camps on your own so it involves more one group
<NatakaTEB> YAY Tikiri! NO lemmings!
<Moonraider> I'm with Tikiri on this im too opinionated to let someone else speak for me
<Vaziel-ID> It would probly be much more fair to let everyone stay and speak their minds, however, the only people with votes should be a guild or an individual
<Tishla_VG> If this is going to be all individueled...  then I would get everyone from my guild to attend this meeting...  
<Darious-SS> im all for 1 officers from each guild speaking
<Vaziel-ID> if you cannot go with your guild's vote...perhaps you are in the wrong guild
* Drucilla agrees with Vaziel
<Manorien{AoW}> as am i
<Manorien{AoW}> this is gettign out of hand
*** Sharniken has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Talzok_TEB> agreed
<Tullus> how about we all quit eq and start a cyber pong league?
<ShadeStorm> good point vaz
<Tikiri-EA> Yes it involves more then one group Sharn But does not allways Involve My guild.
<Nahalen-R> Talzok: thats not really possible, planes cant support multiple camps without massive coordination. 
<Korelin-SS> waiting for Kat to give me the signal to moderate this =P
<Omalley-RK> aye, nothing will be accomplised w/60 people talkin at once
<Moonraider> i agree only 1 person should vote on behalf of the guild for any matters but we all should be able to have our say here on the topics presented
<Tikiri-EA> I have been to PoH many times without my guild but with friends from mixed or unguilded friends of that level
<Xader> Que me, Please. Not that it will do any good..
<Xandrea|TY> Hrmm....I think Ill change my vote to 2 because if I dont then we can argue all night about how many people are here and who speaks as an individual for each guild.
<Darious-SS> but saying individuals votes go as well makes a large loophole
<Nahalen-R> they cant be treated as any other zone, cause there is no other zones anything like them
*** Darious-SS is now known as Bobo
<Bobo> look now im an idividual
<Duira_AP> I hate the idea of a calendar but the reality of it is that these camps/zones that we are speaking of are GROUP efforts. We're not talking about solo spawns here. The reality of it is also that this is voluntary calendar that is not enforcable. Solo efforts will not be able to KS. Can the guilds that are present agree to abide by a calendar?
<Moonraider> Xandrea ;>
<Drucilla> If people have something to say, maybe they should just go ahead and get it out now while Kat is gone so we don't give her a heart attack :-)
<Taloz-KoWW> individual voting simply encourages people to flood the channel with thier guild
*** Bobo is now known as Darious-SS
<Xandrea|TY> hey, look sorry I want things done and in a semi fast motion.
<Korelin-SS> agreed Drucilla
<NatakaTEB> Duira there is a simple solution without the calender
<Omalley-RK> guys, no one likes the fact that we need a calendar...
<Omalley-RK> thats verants fault
<Xandrea|TY> If being a 2 :) makes that faster and creates less arguement about who is just not a member of a guild...you know blah! :)
<ShadeStorm> well one little note on flooding the room....only 100 people can be on this chat thing
<Darious-SS> not to sound like a prick but if this was important to the individuals on the server they wouldbe here
<Omalley-RK> what we are here to do is make the best of a bad situation
<Infestalia> this log should be sent to them..
<NatakaTEB> Dariious only if they dont have a life
<Darious-SS> obviously it is important to the guilds that are represented
<Korelin-SS> good idea Infe
* Xandrea|TY agree with Omalley
<Lejes_Rimul-SS> Nothing is happening and the main issues are not being addressed here.  Later... 
*** Lejes_Rimul-SS has quit IRC (Gmone football is fun for the whole family!)
*** Crover has joined #CTC
<Infestalia> this is midnight and gone for euro's and the middle of a work day for aussie darious
<Drucilla> Omalley, very good point.  We have to be above our own personal greed and try to work out something that's good for ALL the guilds on our server.
<Omalley-RK> so lets see what we can do to that end ok?;)
<Drakyn_EA> lol. I started capturing it the minute the meeting actually started
<Tikiri-EA> Darious there are 2000+ people that play on the CTC server and as Shadestorm just stated,  only 100 people can even GET to this room to be moderated by SS members
<Darious-SS> i understand that Infestalia
<Darious-SS> Tikiri why are you making this an issue with SS?
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Manorien{AoW}> thats why we state issues here and post them on the CTC board for discussion
<Omalley-RK> ideally we could have 2000 people all vote, but we do not live in that world:(
<Tishla_VG> Maybe we just should decide if this is going to be a guild vote or not.... If it is, we should get the questions.... have a guild meeting ... discuss it and come back on at a later date for a vote
<Infestalia> so there are many reasons people cnnot be here and they should still be allowed a right to have thier vote..they are not here cos they don't care
<Tekno> look screw the whol voting, lets just get to the matter at hand and how people thing the planes should be handeled by guilds etc
<Darious-SS> were a guild on CT just like everyone else
<Celestriel-CN> oh dear, what difference does it make WHO is moderating the room?  Why CREATE more issues??
<Drucilla> It's exhausting to hear the uber-guilds point fingures at eachother.  I just tried to reserve a Fear spot for my small-guild alliance and you know what I got?  Late June.
<Korelin-SS> Tikiri, I am NOT showing any favoritism at all towards anyone... I will be the ONLY person to moderate this to help out Kat. If you are unaware I've helped Kat with several things in the past, nothing is different here.
<Duira_AP> Agreed Omalley and I think that the plan suggested today is a great compromise, but 1 week is not enough for lesser populated guilds or a group of transients
<Tikiri-EA> Not everyone knows of this board and this meeting
<Darious-SS> this chatserver just happens to run on the same server as our chat
*** Jacek has quit IRC (Jacek)
<Straylite> This is very simple.  EA WILL follow the calendar and abide by it ONLY if something fair can come out of this meeting.  If the calendar is not changed from its present state of any goof claiming a spot and invite 4 groups of his closest friends (and then returning the favor the next week), EA WILL not abide by it and do what we damn well please.  All we want is fairness for ALL...not fairness for a small group of guilds and buggar anyone else.
<Omalley-RK> mano, i agree somewhat, but there are threads 100+ post loing about the calendar already
*** Bhulak-SS has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Darious-SS> if they read CTC they do
*** Jacek has joined #CTC
<Tikiri-EA> Did someone go around sending /tells to all the guilds?  Those that dont know how to get here?
<Moonraider> ok i have a question, how many people can hate/Fear hold wiothout being too lagged to fight or crahing?
<Omalley-RK> maybe 40?
<Tikiri-EA> I had to "inform" second year (a guild on our server) of this meeting
*** Scytheiea has joined #CTC
<NatakaTEB> Strasylite I am with you
<Infestalia> there are many guilds i never see posting on the boards
<Nahalen-R> Moonraider: 50 tops, but thats pushing it bigtime
<Drucilla> Nah, I've seen it be fine at 45 --- gets ugly in the 60s-70s
<Tikiri-EA> and yes they have atleast a group of 6 +46 in thier guild
<Talzok_TEB> That the way it should be Stray
<arieck_ss> ahh straylite and that is bound to bring fairness ehh?
<Darious-SS> and obviously those guilds are content at this time
<Tikiri-EA> Im not going to Vote and tell someone else what to do.
<Darious-SS> the people present in this meeting are not content with fighting constantly
*** Unitsi has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> I like to make love not war :)
<Nahalen-R> I wonder if kat gave up on us :P
<Tekno> I have 1 big problem with the calander. Thats reserving efreeti, guk, and other misc spawns. IMO it is bs. 2000+ on the server , those spawns can be done with 6 or less . it is not fair to be posting and reserving them . they should be FFA first come first serve
<Omalley-RK> agreed tek
<Korelin-SS> agreed Tekno
<Thornsong> I agree tekno
<Xader> Just my last two cents, maybe you should try to decide who can go where, AFTER the Cazic Thule Server splits into 2. I find it hard to believe ALL of these guilds represented here will remain on the same one.
<Darious-SS> i actually agree there Tekno
<Drucilla> I am representing 4 very small allied guilds' interests today (The Far Eastwood, Imperia Discordia, Hawk Lords, and Dogs of the Apocolyse) so you can be sure I'll be piping up on behalf of small guilds :-)
<Bayn> Darious..that is assuming they even know of the meeting
<Celestriel-CN> I agree on that, Tekno
<Xandrea|TY> Kat said she would whipe them Tek
<Omalley-RK> it should be planes and maybe dragons
<Korelin-SS> aye, Tekno is exactly right
<Taloz-KoWW> Calander should be ONLY planes and maybe dragons
<arieck_ss> agee with tekno on that one
<Xandrea|TY> can we vote on that Issue then?
<zalbar-rp> i agree tech
<Tikiri-EA> Dragons cannot be Calendar Issues
<Darious-SS> if they do not know obviously they arent having a problem at this time
<Drakyn_EA> I got news folks. Even if we settle something at this meeting there is nothing to keep other guilds from making alliances and doing what they want anyways. Not saying we shouldn't try but the calendar is not going to be a final solution by any means
<Duira_AP> it is Tal
<Xandrea|TY> what tek just brought up?
<Tullus> btw all i am claiming all giant rats in east fp for around 4 hours tomorrow... thanks for your compliance
<Tikiri-EA> sometimes the servers come down 2 or 3 times
<Tikiri-EA> sometimes they have not spawned on time
<Moonraider> lol Tullus ya nit :)
<Sintin> i am here to represent all the vertically challeneged
<Omalley-RK> agreed tiki
<Tikiri-EA> you can never tell when a Dragon will be there
<Drucilla> lol Tullus, people are reserving efreeti even
<Talzok_TEB> There should be NO calander...the planes are just another zone..a very hard zone at that
<Taloz-KoWW> Dragons can be calendared, it would have to be differently from planes though
<Omalley-RK> this is what i would suggest on dragons
<Infestalia> lol sintin
<Taloz-KoWW> more of a rotation
<Flareon> The planes are not just anothre zone
<Tikiri-EA> and if they Shedual a dragn for day 1 to and 3 and dont kill it.. is it still thiers to hold? and hide behind a calendar in doing so?
*** Infestalia is now known as Infestalia-TEB
<Xandrea|TY> I like the calendar, its sad that one is needed but I like it, it protects people.
<NatakaTEB> hmmm   quiet... May I speak now?
<Straylite> Here is another great question - just what penalty would a guild 'suffer' for not following this wonderful schedule?
<Taloz-KoWW> Talzok, planes arent another zone lol
<Omalley-RK> if a guild plans to do a raid on naggy, post to ctc and let as many people know as possible
*** NatakaTEB has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Thornsong> The dragon just die the day it is up though -- letting it sit for two days reduces spawns of it and hurts everyone else
<Korelin-SS> still waiting on Kat to get back atm
<Darious-SS> i mean lets face it if we went on single votes all the large guilds have an advantage over the smaller guilds
<Celestriel-CN> If people would have some common courtesy there wouldn't need to be penalties
<Omalley-RK> that way you can let people know you want the shot at it
*** NatakaTEB has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> Oh yah kat went to answer phone
<Tikiri-EA> Yes it does Thornsong
<Duira_AP> be real, how many times have there been confilcts on Naggy raids
<Nahalen-R> heh, one group zoning into a plane and doing something dumb can get everyone in the zone killed, the planes are NOT just another zone
<Korelin-SS> yea Xandy
<Tikiri-EA> 12 Year took MANY days befor getting other guilds to come help them kill it
<Unitsi> !
<Xandrea|TY> sorry forget hehe
<Tekno> and another point i would like to make. How about we state alliance and make it so that each alliance can reserve each plane once per month. So it will be fair to all guilds and time in the planes not based on how many alliance youy have and how fast they book and invite you etc
<Xandrea|TY> Uhm Tiki
<Xandrea|TY> we tried 1 day
<Talzok_TEB> The planes are another zone! whos says they should be treated any different...Its ridiculaous to plan times for a zone...Whats nextr...calander for najena or befallen?
<Xandrea|TY> the second day
<Korelin-SS> I won't moderate this until she comes back and lets me know what to do =P As I said, I'm not going to do anything unless she tells me =)
<Xandrea|TY> we killed her
<Moonraider> guys why cant everyone just play nice and share? *yes those things ya parents taught you*  It would make things alot easier
<arieck_ss> darious:  shouldnt the large guilds have some advantage over the small guilds?..
*** Crover has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<ShadeStorm> ok ss is a solo guild except poa
<Flareon> You've never been to plane then Talzok
<Tikiri-EA> Vox stood for more then 3 befor she was killed
<Darious-SS> i disagree that we cant invite friends to a plane hunt..why let things you dont need decay if someone else can use them
<Manorien{AoW}> brb guys
<Xandrea|TY> Dont start fights or name names its not what this is about.
<Drucilla> Good idea Tekno, but alliances revolve, if there is an 8-guild alliance then it's not quite fair
<Talzok_TEB> I have
<Tikiri-EA> if the server had went down 2ce in those 3 days  thats 3 vox spawns WASTED
<Xandrea|TY> and if you read the calendar you would know what days we planned on killing her.
<Vaziel-ID> sadly this discussion has nothing to do with whether or not this calendar will work, it's more down to who respects who's camp
<Xandrea|TY> we said we would try on saturday, then sunday.
<Tikiri-EA> Vox is not a multi day event  shes about a 4 hour or less event
<Nahalen-R> Tekno: some guilds may not have official alliances, Relentless works with a few guilds on a regular basis, but were willing to work with almost anyone
<Drucilla> You guys, let's talk about productive suggestions for the future and leave the past to the past?
<Korelin-SS> aye Vaziel
<Vaziel-ID> and obviously feelings come into play there
<Vaziel-ID> which is bad
<Behemoth-CN> I think an Alliance only getting 1 section is dumb, SS can and has done fear alone, CN can and has done fear alone, so why cant i go in with them when i want or one of them come in with us if they want?
<Moonraider> Vaziel that is exactly the problem if people respected others camps there would be no need for a calander
<Xandrea|TY> and im sorry if we wasted such a big beast and kept guilds from getting loot.
<Mythral-CN> Tikiri the calendar comes up as a genral guide... have you EVER seen a dragon go to waste ???
<Darious-SS> TYikiri maybe for EA it is but smaller guilds may need to require planning
<Duira_AP> exactly Vaz
<Xandrea|TY> But, Im very happy I killed a dragon
<Sinadilye-CN> You know, I really boggle when people refer to spawn as being WASTED. I mean, think of all the Voxes and Nagafens that spawned before anyone was high enough level to kill them. Does that keep you up at night, thinking they were WASTED?
<Xandrea|TY> Its an honor to Kill Vox :)
<Kenji-Cohort> Xandrea, I think the only problem people had was that Vox spawned on Wednesday and noone tried until Saturday
<Talzok_TEB> And People that are up in the planes are greedy when they are there...Some say "You cant be here" or "We booked it, its ours"..Thats ridiculous..If 2 guilds wish to camp in different spots on planes then it should be ok
<NatakaTEB> Behemoth because then you have the same people (allies) in all the planes all the time
<Straylite> Myth - if a dragon lives longer than a day, it is going to waste.
<Korelin-SS> Kenji, also remember that some guilds do not have most of their members on till the weekend
<Vaziel-ID> Tal
<Kenji-Cohort> Agreed
<Xandrea|TY> Correct Kore
<Vaziel-ID> I would tsay that is true of any other zones
<Oaklandbash> Sin it is plain silly to have a dragon rot when there are so many guilds that can do them now, we didnt want to see that last Vox stay standing
<Tekno> Behemoth: to answer your question , i agree with you. But the flaw to taht is it can be exploited by having a guild make 5 alliance and all of them booking back to back and inviting eachother
<Xandrea|TY> TY most of us play at night or on weekends.
<Celestriel-CN> When guilds are just learning how to do a dragon, it will take more than one try.  It took more than one try for EA and for SS and everyone else.  Why penalize the guilds who are just trying for the first time now?
<Straylite> Taking long amounts of time to kill the damn things lessens the overall amount that spawn.  Simple math.
<Kenji-Cohort> I'm just stating what was said
<Tikiri-EA> This game doesnt keep me awake at night,  Nor does wasted spawns but thats 3 spawns that could have hypotheically speaking killed while waiting for a group/guild to kill it
<Drucilla> That doesn't stop all the planes from being booked up during the week however.
<Korelin-SS> aye, I know that well Xandy =)
<Vaziel-ID> however as Verant has made it, the planes are not zones, but "camps"
<Moonraider> Tal it is too easy to train people in the Planes this isnt like lguk invis up to undead and stroll down to frenz
<Tullus> ehe
<Xandrea|TY> =) kore.
<Mythral-CN> I don't agree Stray, if a guild is using several days to bring him down, and the server hasn't reset meanwhile, then it hasn't
<Xandrea|TY> hehe hey guys

<Aracnakat> I'm back .. has everyone decided on how we're going to work this meeting ....
<Korelin-SS> sorry Flareon, no problem Kat =)
<Omalley-RK> agreed druc
<Celestriel-CN> I agree, Drucilla
<Thornsong> Yes the calendar works
<Nahalen-R> Drucilla: agreed
<Taloz-KoWW> Yep they voted me to make all the decisions
<Aliudyen-DA> Ok i have to take the last people to the airport now.  ill leave this up for the log of the event.  ill be afk until then.  Lawrien is trying to get in now and is getting the info in ICQ and will join as the server lets him
<Tikiri-EA> I dissagree
<Xandrea|TY> Sure kat :) hehe
<Kenji-Cohort> It works if people are willing to talk
<Tishla_VG> maybe we should make everything FFA except for planes... keep those on the calendar....
<Taloz-KoWW> was unanimous
<NatakaTEB> Drucilla No it does not work
<Sabre> if calendar is working why are we here then??
<Nahalen-R> Aracnakat: naw we just agrued the whole time about nothing in peticular :)
<Drucilla> Then maybe the issue at hand is to brainstorm suggestions on what changes could be made to the mechanics of the calendar?
<Drucilla> wb Kat
*** Aliudyen-DA is now known as Ali-afk
<Mythral-CN> Tullus Stray's logic is biased towards highly organized guilds who can take down a dragon on the 1st try. why don't give others a chance to learn ?
<Moonraider> why arent dragons done as whoever is there and clearing the giants gets the dragon? *having 2 people inzone doesnt claim a dragon* BUT with this u cant time it and be there so u get all dragons u need to SHARE spawn with other guilds
<Tekno> i think FFA rules on dragons if ever implemented should be like have atleast 10 people there to claim it?
<Tullus> anyone want to play internet tetris??
<Drucilla> actually, it wasn't a waste of time at all, a few good points were brought up:
<Xandrea|TY> hey yeah tetrinet!
<ShadeStorm> why 10?
<Darious-SS> problem with goign FFA on dragons what is to stop the in-house guilds so to speak from just killing them constantly
<Taloz-KoWW> Nothing
<ShadeStorm> only takes one single group to start pulling giants
<Darious-SS> which screws the smaller guilds
<Xandrea|TY> woo!! hehe if my cable modem wasnt down i would so be on that tullus :P
<Tekno> well we have to set a number. and if you set 1 or 2 then you can always log a twink there
<Drucilla> that because of the multiplicity of guild alliances, a guild can get in many more slots during a month than supposedly allowed
<Darious-SS> and is wrong
<Tullus> yay !
<Drucilla> Many people also voiced the futility of scheduling non-plane raids
<Xandrea|TY> Ok Kat Kat!
<Thornsong> I personally think scheduling a dragon is fine -- but you should only get 2 days to schedule it
<Xandrea|TY> Have that first vote again
<Xandrea|TY> Pwease :)
<Taloz-KoWW> AGREED Thornsong
<Nahalen-R> Yes, agreed
<Tikiri-EA> Yes   large guilds arent suposed to kill Major spawns *gasp*
<Darious-SS> calendar should be limited to planes and dragons
<Moonraider> Shade i wont use an example of the problem of just 1 or 2 people claiming it ;>
<Omalley-RK> agreed thorn
<arieck_ss> ffa dragons is a BAD idea, it will lead to dragon races and ppl will get trained and die and will blame the other side.  BAD idea
*** Flareon has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<ShadeStorm> good, because i can as well on some people ;>
<Moonraider> lol

<Aracnakat> Korelin is going to help me with moderating this meeting ... I do not have the skills to do this (sadly) .. please /msg Korelin if you want to be placed in Que
<Thornsong> A 2 day schedule is short enough not to let it go to waste but does give people a chance to plan
<NatakaTEB> yes and you will be trained for it
<Behemoth-CN> if dragons are first come first serve the same guilds will always get them due to location in the world and availability when they spawn (like after a patch)

<Taloz-KoWW> It's ok..
<Tekno> Having everyoneon the server vote wont work imo also. because how does this affect the people that are nto of level
<NatakaTEB> suits
<Talzok_TEB> i can do that
<Omalley-RK> would be good but what about people who make up fake names to vote?
<Drucilla> I'm not crazy about it.  Uninformed, uninvolved level 5's are gonna be piping up on issues they're not really involved with.
<Ailnidar-RP> I like your idea but anyone smart enought to erase the cookie will throw vote off
<Moonraider> sorry but all i have to say is screw wasting my time here ;> Tikiri u can have my say too please seems i know u will do right ;>
<Manorien{AoW}> i like it
<Korelin-CTC> I would put up a script where it would record ip addresses
<Aracnakat> Omally .. it will log IPs
<Infestalia-TEB> part of the questions should be your level and guild involvement to put votes in perspective
<Sintin> can you stop people from voting multiple times? or exploiting it?
<Darious-SS> good point Omalley
<Drucilla> and the big guild vote will still hugely outnumber the small guild vote.
<turigan> i dont like it, too many anon spam votes
<Omalley-RK> oki, im all fotr it then;)
<Mythral-CN> how can you control so that only 1 individual gets only 1 vote ??? sorry but I don't think it's gonna work
<Aracnakat> Sontin, to some degree yes, it will log IP #s so that an IP can only vote once
<Kenji-Cohort> Why are we voting for something that isn't really broken?
<Darious-SS> so all AOL users count as 1 iP?
<arieck_ss> every time i log in i have a different ip....
<Straylite-Daddy> An uninformed level 5's cash is worth the same as mine.  A guild with 9 members still pays that same 10 bucks that we do.  Who the hell are we to dictate a system that we expect the rest of the server to be shepharded along into?
<Taloz-KoWW> I can vote from several different ip's
<Omalley-RK> hmmm
<Thornsong> ,e 2
<Mythral-CN> everyone with dynamic IPs can vote again then
<Eumen-SS> getting a new ip is easy as reconnecting to the net, or having multiple isp's
<Thornsong> me 2
<Darious-SS> i can change my IPs all i want

<Xandrea|TY> Hey guys I have something to say.
<zalbar-rp> the point is you if it's not moterated you need to be quiet until your queued
<Darious-SS> agree = vote
<Drucilla> But these votes are isolated and arbitrary
<Talzok_TEB> Hey Zam!
<Taloz-KoWW> gimme my queue dangit
<Thornsong> Its possible to come up with a general consensus
<Kenji-Cohort> communicate = talk openly
<Xandrea|TY> I think we need to First discuss what we think is WRONG with the calendar
<Tikiri> Nothing is getting  heard anyway Kat.. we have a big fat hand holding our mouths Shut
<Duira_AP> table the vote counts, lets move onto the calendar
<Nahalen-R> I dont see any difference in having a few massive guilds camping the planes 24/7 and having to wait for your turn on the calendar
<Talzok_TEB> goto next in queue
<Xandrea|TY> Once we figure out what is WRONG with calendar
* Drucilla agrees with Xandreal wholeheartedly.
<Xandrea|TY> Then we can VOTE
<Mythral-CN> weird it's only a problem with you Tikiri
<Sinadilye-CN> Um ok, when you're having a conversation with several people do you ALL talk at the same time? No, you don't.
<Darious-SS> i find that odd also

*** Eumen-SS has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Drucilla> Let them go back to moderating -- at least we can all get to be heard without the background din?
<Tekno> Heres a brief summary of what is wrong with the calander imo. The problem with booking and inviting. what allows a guild to book a plane?
<Aracnakat> 1) How does everyone feel about us wiping the calendar starting with a given date?
<Xandrea|TY> Bad
<Drucilla> That doesn't solve the problem, Kat.
<Tishla_VG> NO!~
<Manorien{AoW}> depends when you do it
<Darious-SS> when
<Mythral-CN> I agree to the idea
<Taloz-KoWW> Yes when
<Omalley-RK> good if done after a period of time
<Aracnakat> (the date can be discussed later)
<_Phr0sT-DoI> 141 Sounds good to me.  It lets our EA friends in on the fun, since they apparently missed the boat
<Infestalia-TEB> when?
<Darious-SS> depending on when i may agree
<Manorien{AoW}> some people are totally screwed on the calendar right now (EA) and it is not fair
*** Eumen-SS has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> Look whiping the calendar is bad
<Taloz-KoWW> I say good, but not to soon
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Drucilla> but all that does is a VERY temporary stop-gap.  We have to think a little longer term than this.
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Xandrea|TY> because if you look out until June.
<ShadeStorm> here is a suggestion...those who have days in march cant schedule in april for hate/fear
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Drakyn_EA> Yeah, its bad. only for those that have massive time scheduled already
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> Okay .. here's the problem as I see it ....
<Aracnakat> Guild A didn't know about the calendar before ...
<_Phr0sT-DoI> Wipe it starting in April, redo the script to let one guild schedule one event per month, and there you have it.  No need to make it fuggin complicated.
<Aracnakat> Guild A goes to schedule an event ..
*** Flare has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> However . Guild's B, C, D, E, F .... have already booked everything from now until next year
<Tishla_VG> I do not agree with this at all!~
<Aracnakat> This is no good .. and obviously not fair to Guild A
<Tekno> and are inviting eachother
<Drucilla> ?
<Xandrea|TY> im in guild a as well as ea
<Xandrea|TY> heh
<Xandrea|TY> *cries*
<Tishla_VG> I book our FIRST VG event in april. been waiting 2 MONTHS to do this.
-Dragosani- (Private) Kat, I have to go. Not sure you're aware, but Verant is splitting CT this month. Meaning, half the people on the calendar, wont be there to do it.  Good luck in the chat =)
<Darious-SS> i think Shades suggestion was fair
*** Retrieving #CTC info...
<Xandrea|TY> I like shades as well
<arieck_ss> here is an idea....  How about once every 2 months you have one of these meetings where only one officer form each guild is allowed and then ppl can scheduale for the newxt 2 months max?
<ShadeStorm> like ss...we will have to wipe our days in fear in april as well hate seeing we some in march
<Taloz-KoWW> I think anyone with no events in march should keep thier april events
<Thornsong> I was under the impression we could schedule one block per plane per month
<Aracnakat> Thanks for the infor Dragonsani .. and good day to you :)
<Xandrea|TY> in march TY only has fear in april TY has nothing.
<Drucilla> Shade can you repeat your idea that people like?
<Dragosani> Bye all. Good luck in this chat..

<Kenji-Cohort> What's the problem with Guild A asking Guild B thru Z if they can come along?
<Omalley-RK> i like that idea ken
<Xandrea|TY> Nothing Ken.
<Tikiri> Then Guild B thru Z should lose thier days
<ShadeStorm> agreed taloz
<Jaedan-DA> nothing IMO Ken
<Xandrea|TY> In fact most guilds do it.
<Xandrea|TY> alot
<Darious-SS> why Tikir
<NatakaTEB> Kenji because guilds b c and invite each other and dont have room for others
<Drucilla> Maybe guilds Y-Z want to do it together without one of the big 5 running it?
<Tikiri> because your using each other
<zalbar-rp> there isnt one .. and why should there be
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Darious-SS> thats not fair to BCD
<Xandrea|TY> so ea can monopolize dar :P
<ShadeStorm> but those who do have things in march have to wipe out their april
<Tekno> thats  a whole another situation kenji. there is hatred on a personal level between some members in certain guilds

<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Tikiri> and screwing the rest of the server
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER

<Aracnakat> This is why we went to moderation .....
<Aracnakat> Okay, so the majority of you do not want to see the calendar wiped at a specific date?
<Darious-SS> depends on the date kat
<NatakaTEB> I want the calender gone completely =)
<Oaklandbash> well guys, been here 90 minutes, good luck with the rest of the meeting, any EA here cna speak for me
<Nahalen-R> I dont see how we could do anything but wipe it
<Aracnakat> Then what about FFA time .. how could that be worked in with no wiping of the calendar ...
<ShadeStorm> rather have it those who get march days dont get april
<arieck_ss> can we take vote on that kat?
<Xandrea|TY> I would rather it not, or if it was be it the expansion release date
<Tishla_VG> I just dont want april taken away from our guild =P
<Tikiri> I want the Calendar gone completely as well
<Aracnakat> Thanks Oak .. appreciate your time :(
<Talzok_TEB> YES
<Straylite-God> We still have the '&Friends' issue.....if 8 small guilds got together, they could monopolize a plane for a month by inviting each other time after time.  =  GAY.
<ShadeStorm> you can have ss's days in hate as an ffa day for hate
<ShadeStorm> we wont be there
*** Oaklandbash has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Drucilla> Straylite, right now small guilds can't do SQUAT unless we're the beneficiaries of a big guild's altruism.  That's no good either.

<Drucilla> No, I've been very grateful to join in the raids of big-guilds, but I'd like to run one someday with other small guilds.  In fact, I can.  In July.
*** Tavin_PainBringer has quit IRC (EOF from client)
<Xandrea|TY> You know I have my room to clean the world to take over, and need to sleep eventually...
<Flare> The root of the problem is no one can agree on what's fair.  That's to be excpected.  We need a thrid party, impartial arbitrator that will 'assign' time to the calendar.  This will negate the fact that some guilds may or may not monopolize the calendar.  The arbitrator will assign days as appropriate to guilds or guilds and allies, making it as fair as possible for everyone.  Once that is done, no one can monopolize it.
<Darious-SS> guys we are talking about now not 3 months from now

<Omalley-RK> guys, can i say somethin and everyone consider it please?;)

<Duira_AP> all this retoric. The first issue should be is there a crowd problem. the answer can only be YES. Second question, should there be a calendar?

<Straylite-God> Fries and a Coke, Kat.  Light salt.
<Darious-SS> yea then we can always fight in game
<Tikiri> Here's My thoughts on this..  Why was there a Calendar in the first place?  so guilds wouldnt bump into each other..  But  what guilds did that involve?  There is no need for a calendar,  THERE IS A NEED however for Those initial guilds to Talk instead of fighting
<Aracnakat> It appears from this discussion that the majority here are not mature enough or willing enough to do that
<NatakaTEB> Please do remove it =)
<Nahalen-R> were damned if we do, damned if we dont.
<Xandrea|TY> I would Like it Kept Kat, if people can agree on things, but being here 90 mins already.
<Vaziel-ID> Behe, the biggest porblem with the calendar is the lack of time to book soon, however the calendar will not be much of a concern or help come the expansion
<Taloz-KoWW> Calendar is a good idea, only if people try to make it work though
<zalbar-rp> lets get back to the que
<Xandrea|TY> Ding Ding Ding Kat thats just it, we need to be mature and agree.
<Duira_AP> que me please
<Vaziel-ID> problem even
<Talzok_TEB> its not about maturity
<Xandrea|TY> well what do call greed?
<Duira_AP> (are we still doing ques)
<NatakaTEB> please let me have my que spot then I will leave and you can discuss nothign all night long without me
<Xandrea|TY> I mean Greed is what this is all about.
<Drucilla> You know, it might not be a bad idea.  If we all had to live with no calendar for a month or two, we'd probably be scrambling to work together after that!

<NatakaTEB> Our server (yes and all the rest as well) is Way overcrowded. Anyone who played UO will remember it was the same there. Also anyone who played UO will remember that the expansion almost completely eliminated this problem. I am hoping that the same holds true here. In that hope (if it holds true) Then what we need is a temporary fix. The calender is a possible temporary fix, but it will breed antagonism in our world that we may not recover from.
<Talzok_TEB> LET nat finish!
<NatakaTEB> did I say done?
<Nahalen-R> Que Me up baby
<Aracnakat> Thank you Nahalen
*** Diggner_46Rog_KoL has joined #CTC
<NatakaTEB> I do have a suggestion for not only a temporary fix, but possibly a permanent fix, that is extremely simple to follow.
<NatakaTEB> The planes are just like any other camp, on a far grander scale, but still just a camp. With that in mind I propose the following;
<Drucilla> ? for Nataka when she's ready
<Diggner_46Rog_KoL> hail all and well met 
<Tekno> if SS was not included for 2 months you would have a problem also darious
<ShadeStorm> yet ea was in it all of feb
<NatakaTEB> Like any other camp it takes a certain amount of people to hold it completely safely, except as opposed to 1 or 2 groups of 6, it may take 6 or 8. Granted 2 or 3 can hold it with only having to camp out 6 times an hour .
<ShadeStorm> i have 3 days in fear
<NatakaTEB> So say Fear takes 6 groups of 6 to be near as safe as possible without being to confusing, now bear with me on this, The calender is a first come first serve entity, so would be the 36 people nessecary to hold the planes safely. Just like any other camp sight after that would be a list o
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<NatakaTEB> Onto the second problem we all encounter, LOOT!
<NatakaTEB> Unlike the "I'm on the calender the rest of you can have what noone in my guild wants" mentality we all suffer and defend ourselves from now. It should be again, just like any other camp. Those who can use it, and dont have it, should random. 
<Omalley-RK> *doesnt wanna be the poor bastage that holds the PoF list*;)
<Drucilla> Nataka I think your last point got amputated at the end?
<Tekno> one problem with that nataka. then what are guilds for?
<NatakaTEB> ok i get it
<Darious-SS> i joined my guild to hunt with them if i wanted to hunt with strangers why be in a guild?
<NatakaTEB> list of who is next to come on board. Like I said simple and every one has been doing this for ages.
<Thornsong> RANDOM DOESNT WORK IN THE PLANES IMO
<NatakaTEB> Darious I am not done yet =)
<Celestriel-CN> Random doesn't work period
<NatakaTEB> Now I know that the people who are showing up at this meeting tommorrow will be all for the calender or bust I will as always refuse to be part of a calender on my relaxation time.
<NatakaTEB> Strive for perfection in all you do, And you will always improve. Nat
<Aracnakat> PLEASE ALLOW NATAKA TO FINISH THEN ASK QUESTIONS
*** Taloz-KoWW has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Straylite-God> Shut the hell up and let Nat speak.
<Omalley-RK> ? when ready
<NatakaTEB> Now you can still hunt with your guilds, Just get them there in time like any other camp
<Diggner_46Rog_KoL> RANDOM doesnt work anywhere IMHO how many efreeti boots are being sold during bazaar when some of the same guilds saying we need to put our name in the camp for efreeti because we have more members to service
<Aracnakat> PLEASE ALLOW NATAKA TO FINISH THEN ASK QUESTIONS

<Aracnakat> Drucilla ?
*** Tekno has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Aracnakat> Thorn, Drucilla nd Nataka have the floor :)
<Drucilla> Well, the issue of being a list-base camp in the planes is way more complicated then, say, Lower Guk.
<Darious-SS> 9 guilds in PoS last week had zero problems
<NatakaTEB> And I have been able to go to the planes for a month and have been trained and asked to leave
<Aracnakat> Darc, Drucilla and Nataka have the floor :)
-Korelin-CTC- Kenji has been waiting to talk... and check out my private message
<Drucilla> I mean, say I get called and I'm next in Sky.  How am I supposed to get there?  Find a wizard and fork out 100+ for a reagent to take one person?
<ShadeStorm> lots of deaths yes, but we work it fully out and took over the island
<Drucilla> Or Fear-- say you're still in NW corner and I'm up, I just come on through the port and train the rest of the zone to the camp?
<NatakaTEB> My suggestion is that you are only in line if you are in the zone
<Taloz-KoWW> umm
<Nahalen-R> ick..
<Drucilla> So I need to camp for 4 days in a zone not even knowing if I'll get called to play?
<ShadeStorm> cant do that for sky and hate
<Darious-SS> so basically turn the planes into LG
<Rieur_Albion> oh pls no
<Taloz-KoWW> The lag from so many people sitting around would be killer
<Aracnakat> STICK TO WHO IS SPEAKING PLEASE
<Jaedan-DA> I have an idea, tell me when to go
<Aracnakat> Kat ?
<Drucilla> Do you mean have a list start at the beginning of a week?
<Aracnakat> sorry Dru, thought you were done
<Drucilla> for the whole week?  (I think your msg on this got cut off so I'm fuzzy on the details)
<Kalorn-Albion> que me pls
<NatakaTEB> Taloz only the people who really want to play would be waiting, and they would not have to be logged into their character just have them in the zone
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<NatakaTEB> and how many times have you been in the planes when it was more than 36 there anyway?
<Drucilla> okay, so we'd go there and log just as if we'd be in camp for the week, but wait for someone to call our alt.
<NatakaTEB> drucilla have you ever been there to help break a zone?
<Drucilla> Yes, I have.
<Darious-SS> Plane of Lower Guk and Sol B
<NatakaTEB> Then you know you start out with a few and gradually get to where there are too many
<Aracnakat> ORDER .. moving back to Que'd ?s
*** Celestriel-CN has left #CTC
<NatakaTEB> this would just put a cap on how many go in the zone

<Nahalen-R> Aracnakat: I asked to be put in the que awhile ago..
<Taloz-KoWW> Where is my queue?
<Aracnakat> My question is ... prior to the calendar your system was semi- in place .. however, there was constant fighting ...
<Aracnakat> Aren't you Talozok?
<Taloz-KoWW> Talzok or taloz?
<Drakyn_EA> There is constant fighting WITH the calendar, Kat...
<NatakaTEB> no thats Talzok
<Aracnakat> sorry Taloz, thought you were the same person
<Aracnakat> I don't see a Talozok so that's you
<Tikiri> People got trained in the name of the  CTC calendar
<NatakaTEB> Arack the difference is that was fighting because people were trying to do different camps and make the plane into two or more camps
<NatakaTEB> instead of joining forces
<Xandrea|TY> ?! :)
*** Kaacee has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> Okay .. I'll let that ride
<Aracnakat> Thornsong ?
<Thornsong> I want to respond to your statement that the calendar does nto work.
<Drakyn_EA> I do remember a time when one guild was in the planes and offered to team up with the other three guilds that showed up and were turned down flat...
<Thornsong> If we agree to work together in a camp, why cant we work together in a calendar
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<zalbar-rp> good point thorn
<Thornsong> The calendar does work.  The Relentless did fear and had several people come up -- people I had never even met
<Tikiri> Because its peoples choice basically Thorn.  People have the "choice" to work with people..   People were not given a choice to go or not to go by the calendar.
<Darious-SS> because your held accountable for your word on the calendar but not in oh ok lets work together
<NatakaTEB> Because we are holding favorites guilds ab and c are inviting each other and monopolizing first come first serve in a game should be when your time is available not 3 months from now

<Aracnakat> Tishla will be the last person to have a ? on Nataka's comments .. we're spending too much time here
<Darious-SS> serious question for everyone if i may ask it please
<Thornsong> I think most people are reasonable people.  If every guild that is capable of doing the planes had at least one block per month there would be little arguing
<Xandrea|TY> My comment is on something else kat
*** Behemoth-CN has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Xandrea|TY> Please !? :)

<Darious-SS> preferably within the next hour
<Diggner_46Rog_KoL> is this being logged?
<Aracnakat> Yes
<NatakaTEB> ok then to make it fair you can only book time on the calender for your guild, then wait until every single other guild goes to that plane once, and then you can book it again
<Thornsong> The major problem we had was EA missed the boat on scheduling and I cant blame them for what they did

<Aracnakat> Thorn, were you done?

<NatakaTEB> It breaks dow to my first statement

<zalbar-rp> I think you should table this post it .. hash out the ideas there this is chaos
<Aracnakat> I couldn't agree more Zalbar :(
<Flare> Shhhh Tullus, now you'll see it up there tomorrow
<Jaedan-DA> well, I have to log for dinner, just my opinion that the calendar needs to be wiped.  Each guild needs to choose 3-4 days to have a plane per month.  Other guilds can invite other guilds and each month a new order is drawn based on in-game randoms.  Thanks for letting me listen, bye :)
<NatakaTEB> I will not be told where and when I can play the game I pay for, and there are more people who feel the same way than there are here
<zalbar-rp> an meet again in a few weeks

<Galar-SS> ?
<Aracnakat> Tishla ?
<Tishla_VG> Look, I think the calender is a good idea because before, my guild had NO chance of getting into the planes before. I have a small guild....  The calendar gave a a chance to organize with others to get in...  Calendar for the plans was a great idea... My guild waited to months so we can do this.  If the calendar was wiped, we would loose out on our chance to get into the planes in April.

<Tikiri> My Question is (and I think an important one)   What if the guild that Schedualed  is not even in the zone IE left to do a dragon or help elsewhere.. or just simply couldnt get enough people interested on that particular day
<Aracnakat> Night Drakyn :) thanks for coming as well

<Tikiri> why let a zone go unused though Kandien? when everywhere is so over crowded
<Drucilla> First I just wanted to identify myself as coming from a tiny guild, like Tishla, we wanted to band together with other tiny guilds and control our own destiny rather than always have to go with the big guilds as their guests.

<Drucilla> Thanks
*** Infestalia-TEB has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Tishla_VG> The calendar gave the smaller guilds control over the planes a bit. 
<Drucilla> Anyway I agree that the calendar gives us a good opportunity, although unfortuantely a RARE opportunity.  First available slots are in July, and I can't tell you how many of the same exact guilds I went over 4-5-6 times to get that slot.
<Drucilla> It seems to me that the calendar as an idea is good, but that the current implementation is bad.
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Darious-SS> it has flaws which need to be fixed
<Drucilla> I also disagree with Nataka's theory of anarchy as good.  She (is she still here?) seems to espose anarchy, but then wants to put an order to it.
<Nahalen-R> Tikiri: cause the spawns are 14 hours, if guild X and friends are casual gamers and can only play during primetime, they waited their time on the calendar and this week is their big shot. yes during the late evening early day the plane will be empty during their time, and will probaby be fully spawned when they login, if someone works the plane while they are gone, the mobs will be dead when they can actually play
*** Sabre has quit IRC (Hell no we wont go..)
<Aracnakat> Thanks Drucilla (just let me know when your are done) :)
<Aracnakat> ORDER - Drucilla has the floor please :)
<Darious-SS> from what ive seen most of the guilds here wish to work to make it functional
<Drucilla> If we say the planes are free-for-all, then what is to prevent a guild from going in and taking over from the list group?  That's the end result of anarchy.
<Drucilla> My suggestion would boil down to things like this:
*** Kandien has joined #CTC
<Drucilla> Spread out the allowable time slots to 6 weeks.  And/or allow only one plane per guild per month, not one slot per plane.
* Straylite-God looks at Xandrea
<Drucilla> Or count guild appearances, if they go with another guild.  Just space it out a little
<Darious-SS> !
* Xandrea|TY puts her clothes back on! :)
<Drucilla> Possibly keep one slot open a month that can't be reserved until 1 week before -- thinks like that.
<Aracnakat> Darious .. is that a ? on Drucilla's topic or your own Que?
<Drucilla> I'm ready for questions
<Thornsong> que me

<Aracnakat> (long ;x : Taloz, Clean, Straylite, Darious, Kodi, Tishla, Ali, Tikiri, Kenji, Jaedon, Xan, Kalouse, Omalley, Galar, Sintin) .. some have left already
<Thornsong> queue me
<Darious-SS> Guild A and B are in need just a few pieces of PoF gear
<Darious-SS> guild C however has very little
<Aracnakat> (Thorn, that Que or ? on Druc's topic?)
<Aliudyen-DA> Btw im back. :P
<Thornsong> queue
<Aracnakat> k :)
<Darious-SS> why should guild C have to lose theyre block because they were invited by A and B so that items didnt just rot
<Straylite-God> I defer my Queue spot to Xandrea, for while my powers are impressinve and godlike, I do not have the ability to penetrate heads of concrete.  I concede.
<Darious-SS> personally i see that as the HIGHEST form of working together
<Drucilla> I'm not sure I understand what you just said?
<Xandrea|TY> wewt! :) I have a drill.
<Tullus> it's funny seeing people try to disguise greed behind "oh i really care for other guilds"... bottom line: everyone wants phat lewtz and there arent enough lewtz.  Stop kidding yourselves.
*** Diggner_46Rog_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Thornsong> Disagree
<Darious-SS> Tullus funny but im in full Verm and i still go to PoF to get people gear
*** Jacek has quit IRC (Jacek)
<Darious-SS> guess it must be one of those personality quirks or something..i enjoy helping others
<Aracnakat> Darious .. Drucilla needs clarifcation on your question
<Tullus> i'm sorry mother theresa
<ShadeStorm> i help break the plane, and my stuff doesnt even come from there
*** Madarch_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Tullus> i should have exempted you from the equation
<Darious-SS> Dru what didnt you understand
<Korelin-CTC> same Shade =)
*** Jacek has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> (Tullus, there are many who are loot greedy, and there are many who aren't)
<Omalley-RK> so true shade
<Drucilla> I don't understand the point you were making, Darious, that the small guilds should just go with large guilds and hope they share loot?
<Darious-SS> ok
<Drakyn_EA> lol Shade. There is Cryo you can use there and you know it
<Taloz-KoWW> he just didnt think that doind that should count against the small guilds time I think
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<ShadeStorm> oh yea, the +1 int stuff
<Tullus> hhe ill go afk again.  i failed to realize that everyone in here is a saint.  my bad.
<ShadeStorm> my mistake
<Darious-SS> when you mentioned about a guild attending on another guilds plane run they forfiet theyre spot
*** Madarch_KoL has joined #CTC
<Drucilla> I never said that
<Drucilla> oh I see what you mean
<ShadeStorm> especially since i own all the cryo stuff before way back in august
<Darious-SS> hang  a sec lemme scroll
<Darious-SS> ok
<Drakyn_EA> You really want me posting the stats of that cryosilk robe your wearing? ;p
<Aracnakat> ORDER - Drucilla & Darious have the floor please
* Straylite-God worships Shadestorm like the god he is.
<ShadeStorm> yep, got it in august
<Drucilla> Well, here's the abuse I see: 4 or 5 guilds schedule one trip each, but all 5 go on all 5 raids.
<Xandrea|TY> Dray and shade take it to tells
<Darious-SS> i mean really  guild A and B helping C will just allieviate more crowding in the future
<Drucilla> The thing is Darious, Guild A and Guild B are ALWAYS gonna have priority.
*** Galar has joined #CTC
<Darious-SS> when its theyre block in PoF yes
*** Galar is now known as Galar-SS
<Tikiri> I agree with Drucilla  I see the same thing going on
<Drucilla> I am level 49, been to all the planes with "the big guilds" and get sloppy seconds from the hosting guild and I'm even below the guilds they invite.
<Darious-SS> if guild C asks them to come along guild C has rights
<ShadeStorm> oh i agree with ea on this actually
<ShadeStorm> about alliances
<ShadeStorm> as long as ALL alliances are stated
<Darious-SS> heres a past example
<Drucilla> I'm level 50 and I have one piece of plane armor that I thought I rolled fair and square for and got booted by not even the hosting guild, but some other random people!
<Darious-SS> CN and SS helped 12y to kill vox a week ago
<Xandrea|TY> yeah :) 
<Drucilla> My small-guild alliance just wants a chance to do it on our own, that's my point.
<Darious-SS> both guilds were offered a shot at loot
<Xandrea|TY> They passed too!
<Darious-SS> both of which was declined
<Tishla_VG> agree Drucious!
<Drucilla> Not because I "don't like" the big guilds, I hope to do more things in the future with them, but it's not working.
<Xandrea|TY> Hey druc, and dar you mind if I comment?
<Xandrea|TY> on something
<Drucilla> You're still talking about big guilds!  You've never even HEARD of mine, I don't often even get to roll on anything.
<Darious-SS> go ahead Xan
<Xandrea|TY> Ok, this is just to say where the dragon loots went
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> TY let whoever was there roll
<Xandrea|TY> and you know who won?
<Xandrea|TY> two people non guilded
<Xandrea|TY> Radia and Reiella, it depends on who the big guild is I guess druc
<Darious-SS> no offense to anyone present but i think that rule applys to certain guilds ways of behavior
<Drucilla> Listen, I didn't mean to get into a topic of sharing morality.  It's not my place to tray to tell people to be nice.
<Xandrea|TY> Cause, in all fairness we let others randoms.
<Drucilla> I'm just saying, small guilds should get a chance to do things on their own if they want, and not 6 months into the future.  That's the bottom line.
<Xandrea|TY> I agree.
<Darious-SS> on a slight side note i was just chatting with someone from UDL in game
<Darious-SS> i told them about the meeting here
<Darious-SS> they said if it wasnt for the calendar they never would have been able to do PoF
<Darious-SS> that tells me the calendar is working
<Drucilla> and right now, there is only enough room in the calendar for the big guilds.
<Tikiri> No
<Duira_AP> so why arent they here?
<Xandrea|TY> same with ty, or any other small guild.
<Tikiri> That tells you the calendar is Partially working
<Drucilla> yes, partially to be sure.
*** Phrost is now known as aa_PhrOst_aa
*** Kandien has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Taloz-KoWW> Because they're killing stuff in Pof ;)
<Darious-SS> i agree the calendar needs honed down
<Duira_AP> seems to me that the calendars existence is a question
<Drucilla> it just needs more space.  Is it fair that EA goes to Hate 6x before another guild can go once?
*** Testing-Ali has joined #CTC
*** Kandien has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> Darious & Drucilla .. are you done? (sorry, just want to move this along)
<Darious-SS> but sitting in here playing pissing contest isnt gonna get a damn thing done
<Kenji-Cohort> I think it works if you can get over greed and communication issues
<ShadeStorm> kenji was able to
<Darious-SS> pardon my french done
<Xandrea|TY> Kenji is good at it :)
<Aracnakat> :)
<ShadeStorm> talked with al the march guilds and was able to get it to work
<Aracnakat> Que: Taloz
<Taloz-KoWW> WOOh
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<aa_Phr0sT_aa> I'm not sure how you guys are running the "list" for who gets to speak, but I'd like to represent DoI's views when I get the chance.
<Taloz-KoWW> ok now
<Aracnakat> k Phrost
<Taloz-KoWW> simply setting up a calendar and making rules for it, won't work by itself
<Taloz-KoWW> rules can always be gotten around
<Taloz-KoWW> What is needed is for each guild on the server to send 1 to 2 representatives to a meeting
<Taloz-KoWW> And the dates for raids are set THERE
<Taloz-KoWW> and agreed upon THERE
<Darious-SS> good idea
<Tikiri> It has to work with Cooporation .. and unless you have 100 percen backing on the calendar.. it wont fly
<Aliudyen-DA> Agree fully Taloz
<Taloz-KoWW> This could be done monthly I think
<ShadeStorm> aye taloz
*** Bayn has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
*** Jacek has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Darious-SS> last week over every month theres a planning meeting
<Omalley-RK> hella idea;)
<Aliudyen-DA> It has to be done monthly :P due to the dynamics of guilds on the server
<Darious-SS> err over = of
<Taloz-KoWW> Everyone has to come and agree though
<Taloz-KoWW> or it wont ever work
<Xandrea|TY> I agree to it
<Darious-SS> well if it affects them
<Xandrea|TY> on 1 condition.
<Omalley-RK> results would need to pe posted to;)
<Taloz-KoWW> Of course
<Xandrea|TY> we start it beggining of April.
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> or may
<Taloz-KoWW> Agreed on that Xandrea
<ShadeStorm> again, those who have march days shouldnt be allowed april days
<Darious-SS> aye and the guilds who are scheduled for planes in March dont get those planes in April
<Kenji-Cohort> Post Expansion maybe
<Taloz-KoWW> Those with no days in march should keep their april days though for sure
*** Curufin has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Darious-SS> expansion may help to solve the calendar issue
<ShadeStorm> yea
<Tikiri> Just dont Force it down everyones throats
<Tullus> how about we do this like civilized people: every guild goes pvp with each other and whoever wins keeps the plane !
<Mythral-CN> what about you shut up Tullus
<Tullus> :(
<Aliudyen-DA> I agree with Mythral given he hasnt added anything useful tothe conversatioj
<Drucilla> Sounds like we're talking about wiping again?
<Darious-SS> Tullus if ya cant say something constructive go back to your aol chatroom
<Taloz-KoWW> only partially
<Tullus> on my way
<ShadeStorm> no we arent druilla
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<ShadeStorm> only those who have march days would be wiped
*** Curufin has joined #CTC
<ShadeStorm> in april
<Drucilla> gotcha
<Aracnakat> Taloz has the floor ... if you have questions or comments on Taloz suggestion, please ask for Que by ???
*** Dalmi has joined #CTC
<Tikiri> ???
*** Turigan has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Aracnakat> Tikiri ?
<Dalmi> hello
<Taloz-KoWW> Then we would have officer/gm's from the guilds who have planes/dragons ready ppl meet and figure out the rest
<Darious-SS> !
<Taloz-KoWW> And everyone would be free to invite ANYone they wanted
<Taloz-KoWW> Just the dates would be agreed on, and everyone would make sure it was at least close to fair
<Drucilla> ?
<Xandrea|TY> ???
<Aracnakat> Tikiri ?
<Tikiri> anything decided about the calendar is only decided by those who agreed and for those that didnt or wont agree should not have it jammed down thier throats or Trained if they do not comply with others opinions
<Dalmi> hey. have anyone seen Oaklandbash around?
*** aa_Phr0sT_aa is now known as Oaklandbash
<Taloz-KoWW> Nobody should be trained over this stupid calendar
<Xandrea|TY> he left
<Mythral-CN> ?
<Tikiri> Taloz well there were people trained over this Calendar
*** Straylite-God is now known as Norad
<Norad> Stopr Phrost.
<Darious-SS> if all plane ready guilds are willing to work with it why would we train eachother?
*** Norad is now known as Straylite-Daddy
<Taloz-KoWW> I know Tikiri, was sad
<Xandrea|TY> Can I comment/make a quetion tal?
<Tikiri> But thats just it Darious they arent all agreeing
*** Oaklandbash is now known as Ol-Uncle-Phrosty
<Aracnakat> Darious ?
<Darious-SS> plus the monthly meeting allows smaller guilds coming up in level to give input for what they want
<Taloz-KoWW> whoevers up
<Tikiri> And thats another thing as well your statemnt I find offencive
<Tikiri> If we agree why would we train?
<Tikiri> So that means those that dont agree can expect it?
<Darious-SS> ok as far as i have seen EA and EB have been the only 2 not following to this point
<Xandrea|TY> *agree with Darious*
<Darious-SS> youve made this into a guild thing
<Korelin-CTC> aye
<Xandrea|TY> and I can tell you why, but ill wait my turn
<Galar-SS> ?
<Darious-SS> and it is not
<Tikiri> No I didnt
<Tikiri> Im saying anyone
<Darious-SS> its about what can we do to make life livable on this server
<Tikiri> I didnt say any guild
<Xandrea|TY> but you speak for ea.
<Xandrea|TY> thats all he is saying
<Drakyn_EA> Whoa hoss. BAck off. Except for two incidents EA HAS followed the callendar and the Vox thing was a mis-communication between some twelve year members and Oak
<Darious-SS> if all plane ready guilds go to the monthly meeting and schedule time together then there should be no questions
<Tikiri> yes Darious I completely understand that,  but what Im saying is.. those that wish to not have thier game planned out for them  should not be "Forced" to
<Xandrea|TY> *cough*
<Straylite-Daddy> Could you be my....won't you be my......please won't you be....my neighbor.
<Aracnakat> NOTE: This might only be a "situation" until the expansion (lets hope)
<Taloz-KoWW> gah
*** Straylite-Daddy is now known as StrayliteRogers
<Darious-SS> if all plane ready guilds go to the monthly meeting and schedule time together then there should be no questions
<Mythral-CN> ?
*** Ol-Uncle-Phrosty is now known as MrMcFeeley
<Drucilla> 3 hour meetings once a month?  Never happen :-)
<Tikiri> But what Im saying Darious is those that Object
<Aracnakat> Darious & Tikiri are you done with your questions? Others are waitnig in Que
<Darious-SS> the monthly meeting also allos any guilds who have become ready to do planes join in as well
<Xandrea|TY> these shouldent take 3 hours
<Xandrea|TY> if people would agree ;)
<Duira_AP> ?
<Tikiri> Xandera not everyone agrees though =)
<Xandrea|TY> ??????? :)
<Galar-SS> ?
<Darious-SS> who doesnt agree with the blocking meetings every month?
<Aracnakat> (? = Drucilla, Xan, Mythral, Galar, Duira)
<Kandien> well tikiri thats why we are here right? because some objected and now they want to change it
<Kandien> lets not discuss the results of an objection to the calander before anything is even decided
<Darious-SS> does anyone disagree that the aforementioned way could solve the problems?
*** MrMcFeeley is now known as Phrost-DoI
<Darious-SS> or at least a good deal of them
<Duira_AP> in what format Darious (I'll wait until my turn)
*** Flare is now known as Phrack-DoI
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Nahalen-R> it could solve them, but getting people to agree... impossible! :)
<Sintin> im waiting my que also
<Manorien{AoW}> can we get a quick synopsis of it darious
<Darious-SS> ok
<Phrost-DoI> doh
<Aracnakat> Drucilla ?
<Darious-SS> lets say CT has 10 plane level guilds
<Darious-SS> hypothetical situations we have more
<Taloz-KoWW> alliances of smaller guilds also ;)
<Drucilla> I was just gonna ask if he meant a monthly meeting, but it sounds like that answer is yes.
<Xandrea|TY> 10/60=6
*** aa_PhrOst_aa is now known as Phrack
<Drucilla> (heh, thank you Taloz :-)
<Taloz-KoWW> yes I did
<Aracnakat> (? = Xan, Mythrad, Galar, Duira)
<Xandrea|TY> wewt!
<Darious-SS> just using this as an example
<Xandrea|TY> Is this just a question cue or my formal cue kat?
<Darious-SS> 2 reps from each guild come and meet to block theyre time in the planes for the coming month
<Darious-SS> no more than 2
<Aracnakat> (Que = Clean, Kodi, Tishla, Ali, Nahalen, Tikiri, Kenji, Jaedon, Xan, Kalous, Omalley, Galar, Sintin, Thongsong, Phrost)
<Xandrea|TY> hey kat
<Tikiri> But again Darious,  you have the alliance issue
<Duira_AP> huh>?
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> stray traded with me
<Darious-SS> so?
<Taloz-KoWW> Thos alliances choose two people
<Xandrea|TY> I cant stay that long :(
<Tikiri> Darious would you please send me a tell thing
<Darious-SS> alot of guilds ally
<StrayliteRogers> I gave Xandrea my spot
<Aracnakat> k
<Thornsong> 1. SS 2. CN 3. DA 4. EA 5. CC 6. Relentless 7. 12Year 8. AoW 9. DOI 10. Masks 11. EA2 12. EB 13. KoWW 14.  RP 15. Albion 16.  EdC 17. VG -- did I miss anyone
<Aracnakat> Xan is between Clean & Kodi then (neithe are here I don't think)
<Darious-SS> int he case of very small guilds
<Madarch_KoL> yes KoL
<Xandrea|TY> Steel wind Thorn.
<Darious-SS> they can choose a rep
<Darious-SS> and say were doing this as an alliance hunt
<Aracnakat> Xandria ?
<Taloz-KoWW> Yep
<Xandrea|TY> Ok.
<Unitsi> RP
<Thornsong> UDL
<Xandrea|TY> Its been over 2 hours now guys so lets actually make progress.
*** Kandien has quit IRC (Leaving)
*** Phrack-DoI is now known as Phrost-Pokemon
<Aracnakat> ORDER Xandrea & Taloz have the floor
<Darious-SS> i dont think if its SS's week in PoF we shouldnt be allowed to invite whoever we pleased
<Phrost-DoI> ack
<Phrack> ack
<Xandrea|TY> My thoughts on why ea would be against calendar changing is that right now they dont have anything booked until may and jun
<Dalmi> We have DoA ready for planes
<Darious-SS> actually Kat i never finished ;)
<Xandrea|TY> and right now, every other guild does.
<Aracnakat> Sorry Darious .. your time is up ;p :)
<Xandrea|TY> But, my comment to that is
*** Phrack is now known as Phrack-DoI
<Aracnakat> (but you are in Que) :)
<Xandrea|TY> If we do the everyone meet once a month thing youll get a refreshed spot at getting a shot
*** StrayliteRogers is now known as Queue
<Xandrea|TY> in these months of march and april
<Xandrea|TY> Personally I like this idea.
<Taloz-KoWW> March should remain as it is
<Xandrea|TY> The resrictions that should be made is
<Xandrea|TY> March should stay as is.
<Xandrea|TY> but whoever has spots in march should not get april
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
*** Zamdramas has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Queue> Agreed.  Hands off March.
<Xandrea|TY> Like TY has fear in march
*** Dalmi is now known as Dalmi-DoA
<Xandrea|TY> so whipe us from fear in april
*** Phrost-Pokemon is now known as PokePhrack
<Xandrea|TY> now, the question is should we get a shot at hate in april?
*** Queue is now known as PikaStray
<Xandrea|TY> *just using ty as example*
<Taloz-KoWW> I would probably say yes
<Nahalen-R> theres a better way to do it.. <waits patiently ;>
<Xandrea|TY> well thats something that would need to be decided.
<Taloz-KoWW> depends on how many others
*** Phrost-DoI is now known as Phrackachu
<Aracnakat> Mythral ?
<Xandrea|TY> something else we could do, is an idea like kore,s but just simply a survey to see what people find wrong with the calendar
<Aliudyen-DA> thats a good name phrost keep it there its the best one so far
<Xandrea|TY> not actually anything that woulc change.
<Darious-SS> Stray your truly showing your matuity btw
<Xandrea|TY> Just some ideas.
<Mythral-CN> just wanted to elaborate a bit on what Tikiri said... what to do if your time is up and you find a guild in the plane upon insertion ???
<Xandrea|TY> Personally
<Xandrea|TY> I have 15 or so minutes before I need to go
<Xandrea|TY> and I would like to see something accomplished by then.
<PikaStray> I have to do something to stay awake, Darious.  Try to focus on the issues at hand instead of bullshit personal attacks.  People like you clog the gears of progress.  I am listening intently so deal.
<Xandrea|TY> So please lets forget our guilds and just get stuff done, and agree.
<Thornsong> Give Nahalen the floor please Kat
* Xandrea|TY is done, for now.
*** Scytheiea has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Mythral-CN> should you leave the place because someone is there, while you took the time and effort to coordinate with other guilds to get up there ?
<Xandrea|TY> any questions comments flames?
<Madarch_KoL> If its your bedtime then go to bed
<Aracnakat> I'll put Nahalen at the end of ? Que for this topic as I feel that his topic is very similar
<Thornsong> Ok
<Nahalen-R> ok
<Darious-SS> ? on Mythrals comment
<Aracnakat> Mythral has the floor please (Mythral and Taloz)
<Mythral-CN> I asked my question
<Aracnakat> Darious can ask question of Mythral :)
<Taloz-KoWW> I would consider it very hmm
<Taloz-KoWW> rude to jump in someone elses slot early in the day
<Darious-SS> Mythral you talking about PoF/PoH or sky
<Kalorn-Albion> ?
<Xandrea|TY> Oh, I forgot to add one thing
*** Madarch_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Mythral-CN> PoF and PoH mainly, as in Sky there's little risk of training upon insertion
<Tishla_VG> ?
<Aracnakat> Galar ?
<Xandrea|TY> Kat I appreciate this Calendar and what it has done for people, in small guilds and big guilds, and I apologize for the headaches you recive for being so nice.
<Darious-SS> like i had a question if in PoS you work to isle 3 and your time ends its gonna take the next group minimum 24 hours to get to there should you have to leave?
<Aracnakat> -hehe- thanks Xan :)
<Galar-SS> ok just to comment, we will never get everyone to agree on this, consider this like an election, if you don't vote you have no say.
*** Madarch_KoL has joined #CTC
* Xandrea|TY hands Kat some pain meds taken from her broken leg stash
<Aracnakat> Duira ?
<Mythral-CN> well we're not up there yet, maybe let that for another meeting ;)
<Galar-SS> We are not going to please everyone nor get everyone involved, it is just not possible
*** Phrackachu is now known as Phrack-Phrost-AFK
<Duira_AP> My question was way back...Regarding the monthly meeting, how is that any better than a web calendar?
<Taloz-KoWW> This way it isnt who signs up first
<Kenji-Cohort> Darious that sounds like something that can be worked out via communication
<Taloz-KoWW> everyone meets together and agrees
<Drucilla> what happened to the wiping April idea?
<Taloz-KoWW> and nobody is allowed to "piggyback"
<Aracnakat> (afk) once Duira is done, Kalum's up for ? .. then Tishla (brb)
<Darious-SS> depends on the definition of piggybacking
<Duira_AP> So what ur saying is that someone has to propose a date block and everyone votes on it?
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Drucilla> omg that's an 8 hour meeting
<Duira_AP> EXACTLY
<Darious-SS> hold a lottery in the beginning
<Xandrea|TY> good idea
*** Hobin has joined #CTC
<Thornsong> Nahalen has that covered
<Taloz-KoWW> I agree, lotto it
<Xandrea|TY> then whoever wins lotto gets first pick
<Nahalen-R> Darious-SS: wait for my idea, :)
<Taloz-KoWW> the slots
<Drucilla> technologically, now?  IRC doesn't have a /random.
<Duira_AP> bah, i never win the lotto
<Duira_AP> )
<Drucilla> er, how
<Taloz-KoWW> in game?
<Darious-SS> no here
<Duira_AP> there;s no diff...
<Nahalen-R> ok guys, since it was brought up slightly, Im gonna skip a bit and just say it
<Xandrea|TY> I wanna here Nah
<Nahalen-R> I thought up a lottery system like an hour ago...
<Duira_AP> in a board reservation or a live communication, thats NOT why the calendar is failiny
<Xandrea|TY> before I must go :)
<Darious-SS> moderator picks a number from 1 to 100 then the closest gets first second closest gets second and so on
<Duira_AP> err failing
<Nahalen-R> all guilds that want to go to the planes, gets assigned a number
<Drakyn_EA> LOL
<Thornsong> Bah it can be done offline Darious
<Nahalen-R> then randoms are done
<ShadeStorm> then i have a question for all
<Nahalen-R> and assigned timeslots...
<ShadeStorm> if ya using a mod
<Nahalen-R> its fair to everyone
<Drakyn_EA> Who would be the moderator that would be impartial? ;)
<ShadeStorm> to assign, ss is in trouble since we constantly get attacked by people saying its bias
<Thornsong> Aracknakat gets my vote
<Duira_AP> i must be missing the point ( moderator: i coceed my time)
<Xandrea|TY> kat gets mine too
<Nahalen-R> probably kat
<Xandrea|TY> if she doesent mind headache hehe
<Darious-SS> prolly Kat
<Duira_AP> err conceed
<Nahalen-R> Everyone gets a fair shot
<Mythral-CN> I vote for Oak :)
<Xandrea|TY> *cough*
<Nekoj> I will be the number holder
<Omalley-RK> omg a viable solution!;)
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)

<Nahalen-R> cause each month will have X time periods
<Drucilla> you know all guilds won't come every week.
<Darious-SS> well with as many guilds as we have there shouldnt be any
<Drucilla> er month
<Nahalen-R> and they will be lotto'ed till full
<Xandrea|TY> Nek, maybe :)
<Thornsong> Each group is guaranteed 1 block per month
<Nahalen-R> do it on a monthly basis
<Darious-SS> why not Druc?
<Tikiri> Sorry ahd to go afk
<Thornsong> Rest leave to the people who can handle it
<Darious-SS> if ran right the meeting would be done in an hour
<Taloz-KoWW> They could be contacted in game
<Drucilla> I agree with Thornsong, anything empty becauses FFA but NOT to guilds who already have slots
<Taloz-KoWW> to make sure they knew
<Aracnakat> (back) Did Duira, Kalurn, & Tishla go?
<Tishla_VG> no...
<Drucilla> they could reserve it on the calendar.
*** Aliudyen-DA has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> No we cheated kat
*** Idar has joined #CTC
<Duira_AP> doh arac, yes
<Duira_AP> i must be missing the point ( moderator: i coceed my time)
<Aracnakat>  :)
<Taloz-KoWW> Karlorn next I think
<Nahalen-R> Aracnakat: i skipped cause darious brought up a lotto idea ...
<Aracnakat> K Duira :)
<Aracnakat> Ahh . k
<Drucilla> although bizarrely we seem to be congealing on an idea
<Xandrea|TY> yeah yeah!
<Xandrea|TY> an idea
<Xandrea|TY> I can give a speach again im good at them
<Nahalen-R> Does anyone have any possible complaints against a time lotto?
<Xandrea|TY> =)
<Omalley-RK> most guilds who are interested in the planes have at least 1 member that reads the boards;)
<Aracnakat> Isn't that amazing! :) .. lets mark this dtae and time down in the history books :)
<Thornsong> The lotto is fair to all -- each person posts the last 10 days of the month that they would like to be in next months lotto
<Darious-SS> does anyone disagree with the monthly meeting and luck of the draw type thing for slot choice?
<Taloz-KoWW> Sounds workable to me Nah
<Xandrea|TY> 7:55 not sure what day kat hehe lost track
<Drucilla> Let's ask Kat though if this is possible from her standpoint (as calendar administrator)
<Tishla_VG> Em...  I have a problem with this.  Granted this is a good idea HOWEVER, I relaly dont want to give up VG first time in april. We have waited over two months for this time slot..
<Xandrea|TY> how many days been here have we?
<Nahalen-R> Darious-SS: I only say no cause getting people to agree on time slots would be impossible
<Sintin> we abstain till we get some other things settled also
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> Tish you keep your spot
<Aracnakat> HOLD ONE SEC
<Kenji-Cohort> Just start all the stuff post expansion release done
<Kenji-Cohort> date
<PikaStray> With a lotto, someone will always get screwed as well.  Some people have lives and might not be able to meet at the 'lucky' time.
<Darious-SS> you dont agree on timeslots
<Taloz-KoWW> We still should guarantee any slots in april but have no slots in march
<Xandrea|TY> ask for order kat
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Drucilla> Kat, if there were a lotto and we filled up most slots, could you put them into calendar, but leave rest of month open for regular booking?  Or is that too much of a pain?
<Darious-SS> lady luck makes the agreement for you
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Xandrea|TY> shhh...everyone.
<Xandrea|TY> Let us please explain to kat what we have come up with
<Aracnakat> I want to ask for possible agreement on two things ...
<Xandrea|TY> so that she may comment.
<Aracnakat> WAIT .. one sec ..
*** Idar is now known as Idar-DoA
<Nahalen-R> lets let kat talk please
<Hobin> hehe
<Tishla_VG> I dont mean to be mean or selfish...  but I have waited... been patient and followed the rules from the last meeting we had...  I really dont want to give up our first shot at this. Please do not think I am being selfish over this..
<Aracnakat> IF .. we go with this idea (and I think it's a good one - the combinations of Taloz, Darious, & Nahalen's ideas) .. can we all agree .. to allow the guilds who haven't had a chance in the past to keep their dates (ie, Tishla_VG)?
<Omalley-RK> aye!
<Nahalen-R> Tishla_VG: your not being selfish
<ShadeStorm> aye
<Duira_AP> AGREED
<Aracnakat> (and other gulids like VG who haven't gone in the past?)
<Nahalen-R> Yes.
<Drucilla> I think that's TOTALLY fair.
<Thornsong> Sure, just exempt them from the first lotto
<Kalorn-Albion> aye
<Xandrea|TY> yes we agree
<Drucilla> No bumping VG.
<Darious-SS> the wipe was only for guilds blocked for march
<Darious-SS> so yes
<Xandrea|TY> march stays the same
<Tishla_VG> I can agree wit hthis =)
<Taloz-KoWW> Amazing
<Aracnakat> OMG .. we have agreement! :)
<Omalley-RK> omg agreement!
<Xandrea|TY> and if someone missed in march then they get first pick in april
<Darious-SS> thru chaos comes genious
<Omalley-RK> rofl
<Kenji-Cohort> Not really
<Xandrea|TY> yeah Im all about speaches :P
<Taloz-KoWW> I'm gonna have a heart attack and I'm only 22
<Nahalen-R> Wow... Relentless really is switzerland... geneva convention anyone lol
<Duira_AP> TIME 8:52 EST agreement )
<Xandrea|TY> I can give mouth to mouth Taloz
<Aracnakat> Okie .. so our first agreed upon issue is that whatever choice is made guilds with no prior timeslots can keep their current slots
<Xandrea|TY> only 100pp
<Drucilla> yes XAndrea, that sounds good
<Omalley-RK> lucky tal;)
<Kenji-Cohort> Everyone loses their april dates?
<Taloz-KoWW> lol
<Sintin> TEB will not vote on the random thing till other issues r settled also
<Aliudyen-DA> I think thats fair KAt
<Drucilla> not guilds who did not have a March date.
<Xandrea|TY> only if they had something in match Ken
<Darious-SS> if your scheduled in March for PoF you cant schedule in April for PoF
<Xandrea|TY> Like TY would lose april dates because we have POF in march
<Xandrea|TY> but VG would not lose april because they had no dates in march
<Drucilla> But you would not lose-lose them, you'd just be back in the lottery.
<Kenji-Cohort> I think we need to move this to post expansion to start a lotto
<Aracnakat> Did Kalorn get to make his/her statement/question yet?
<Xandrea|TY> make sense?
<Darious-SS> but VG is fine they didnt schedule for March
<Nahalen-R> Kenji-Cohort: I think thats the tentative plan
<Taloz-KoWW> No still waiting on Kalorn 
<Kalorn-Albion> just waiting atm - this is actually getting somewhere :)
<Xandrea|TY> hrhe
<Aracnakat> K Kalorn, I just don't want to pass you up :)
<Drucilla> The question is, technically, how would this lottery work?  We don't have /random in IRC.
<Nahalen-R> Random it in game, at a specific spot so anyone can watch
<Darious-SS> kat picks a number from 1 to 100
<Nahalen-R> like the raffle
<Tishla_VG> loto is a good idea. and thanks all for agreeing =)
<ShadeStorm> there is dice you can use
<Aracnakat> NO NO NO ... Kat's not picking numbers .. someone would see this as a loophole for SS .. nonononon
<Drucilla> and then we just say a number into IRC?
<Xandrea|TY> we already agreed kat
<Xandrea|TY> you should be the moderator
<Duira_AP> heh
<Darious-SS> or if we all trust her enough she puts all guilds names in a hat and pulls 1
<Xandrea|TY> we (I) trust you.
<Nahalen-R> Aracnakat: you were already nomintated :P
<Darious-SS> Kat you dont discriminate
<ShadeStorm> i asked the question kat....trust me on this
<Darious-SS> you hate everyone
<Aracnakat> Aye .. but some would question it??
<Mythral-CN> Nekoj offered to pick the number too
<Xandrea|TY> Your the most fair. Kat.
<Kenji-Cohort> of course they would
<Unitsi> rofl
<Kenji-Cohort> better to avoid it
<Xandrea|TY> well then tell them to stuff it Kat!
<ShadeStorm> i wanted to be sure ss doesnt get blasted for it
<Xandrea|TY> Ill beat them up Kat.
<Aracnakat> What if 3 months in a row SS won .. and they really won .. it would look rigged .. nope, can't go with that
<Thornsong> just assign a time in game and be there and do it so all can see
<Taloz-KoWW> Maybe
<Drucilla> I know: each month it's a different person/different guild that picks the number?
<Omalley-RK> lets get a gm to roll....LOL
*** Phrack-Phrost-AFK is now known as Phrackypoo-AFK
<Taloz-KoWW> ASk a GM to run random?
<Thornsong> anyone who wants to show can see you that you are fair
<Darious-SS> i can see the possible repercussions but also Kat has shown she shows no favor to anyone
<Xandrea|TY> hey that would work Druc
<Kenji-Cohort> better to avoid any repercussions
<ShadeStorm> we could possibly get a gm to do it
<Tishla_VG> agreed. I trust Kat =)
<Aracnakat> Thanks Kenji .. I agree :)
<Omalley-RK> trust is a good thing;)
<Darious-SS> Melachite maybe
<Drucilla> I wish people would just call me "Dru" instead of "Druc" it makes me sound like a polish sausage
<Darious-SS> hes pretty cool
<Kenji-Cohort> perception is key folks
<Taloz-KoWW> I trust kat, but I think if a GM would random it would be best
<Aracnakat> I appreciate everyone's trust .. but it's just got the potential for me and SS to get smeered all over the place
<Drakyn_EA> Oh GMs don't show favoritism ever. LOL. They are people to and subject to friendships as is everyone
<Xandrea|TY> well sorry polish sausage :) pay me no mind.
<Nahalen-R> Who would be percieved as impertial though =\
<Thornsong> Give everyone 10 days prior to post whether they want in the lotto -- Have a list and then do a 1-19 or whatever
<Duira_AP> then quit SS )
<Nahalen-R> impartial even
<Darious-SS> rock paper scissors?
<Xandrea|TY> yeah join TY again kat! :)
<Drucilla> So we random in-game?
<ShadeStorm> have furies do it...then you know for a fact ss wont be considered a favorite
<Taloz-KoWW> lol
<Darious-SS> i dont like ingame random
<Aracnakat> LOL .. just random in game .. everyone gets a number .. and someone does /random
<Darious-SS> it is hackable
<Drucilla> me neither, pain in butt
<Duira_AP> in game is good
<ShadeStorm> because he and i dont get along
<Omalley-RK> and we can use the calendar to show who has what
<Xandrea|TY> hey I got an idea.
<Taloz-KoWW> ingame random by a gm, they might favor people but not that much
<Taloz-KoWW> if they would do it...
<Nahalen-R> trouble is getting a GM to agree
<Aracnakat> Problem is .. Not sure that we can get a GM to do this .. they might not be allowed, willing, or able
<Thornsong> But Aracknat will be rolling -- she rolls for the bazaar doesnt she
<Drucilla> can't we just do it in IRC and each guild just blurt out a number?  Low-tech but it would work
<Thornsong> People trust her with their plat
<Xandrea|TY> Kat can be moderator but if she just randoms to / 1 1000 and we roll to whatever number she got with that 1000
<Kenji-Cohort> What's the date for the expanision coming out?
<Taloz-KoWW> I say try to get a gm, or just get aracnakat to do it
<Darious-SS> who knows Kenji
<Drucilla> whoever's closest to number she picks
<ShadeStorm> april 22
<Thornsong> No we shouldnt have to be there for the lotto
<Nahalen-R> hold on
<Thornsong> No we shouldnt have to be there for the lotto
<Nahalen-R> could everyone listen for a second pleasE? I need to clarify
<PokePhrack> April 24
<Darious-SS> id say lets worry about expansion next month
<Taloz-KoWW> listening
<Nahalen-R> please...
<PikaStray> Whatever is decided here will not be condoned by Verant...so no staff assistance.  It clearly violates the policies and procedures for customer service.
<Aracnakat> How about whatever guild gives me the most Plat gets to go first? (likes this idea)
<Duira_AP> they wont support or enforce
<Aliudyen-DA> Stray is correct there
<Phrackypoo-AFK> hehe Kat
<Madarch_KoL> What if by some unforseen event (points at Verant) it gets postponed
<Drucilla> Pika is probably right, it might put them in a position of liability if someone bitches.
<Xandrea|TY> hrmm kat im broke
*** Phrackypoo-AFK is now known as Phrosticles
<Xandrea|TY> I can slut myself again maybe I can get a slot in fear if I do that.
<Aracnakat> -knocks TY off the list- ;p :)
<Nahalen-R> How I proposed this to work.. guilds are assigned numbers on a first come first serve basis. so its 1 2 3 4. then someone /random 1 #ofguilds in game
<Xandrea|TY> *cries*
<Darious-SS> question is there a script than can be run that would pick a random name?
<Thornsong> Have each guild post on CTC that they want in the lotto -- make a list there and then have her roll 1-19 if 19 people sign up.  She does that until the people are assigned.  Anyone who wants to be present can be there with a list from the CTC and see who won
*** Idar-DoA has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Aracnakat> I agree Nahalen ...
<Xandrea|TY> that works nah
<Nahalen-R> first number to come up gets the first open spot or a perfered slot on the calendar
<Xandrea|TY> that works well Nah.
<Aracnakat> Like NFL draft pick ;p
<Tikiri> What lotto?
<Drucilla> Actually, Kat, do you have full admin on this web site?
*** Hobin has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Aracnakat> First to sign up on CTC is #1 in lottery, second is #2 .. and so on, that will assign the numbers .. the /random will just be the numbers involved
<Omalley-RK> will need to be done about the middle of the month b4 the one in question
<Aracnakat> What's that mean Drucilla?
<Nahalen-R> Omalley-RK: yup
<Thornsong> Yes 10 days prior so people can sign up
<Nahalen-R> Aracnakat: exactly
<Kalorn-Albion> how about we change the person that roles each month
<Nekoj> Sorry to interupt, I will see you all later and wish you luck, it is now time for me to leave :-(
<Taloz-KoWW> sounds good to me
<PokePhrack> You all are aware that the random number generator Verant has is client side and is not even vaguely random, yes?
<Duira_AP> yes Kal
<Aracnakat> Kalorn, good idea
<Xandrea|TY> Bye nek! :) :(
<PikaStray> Night, Nek.
<Drucilla> I just mean if you want, I could develop a Web craplet to do this for you, although I'm also a firm believer in Occam's Razor (simpler is better)
<Taloz-KoWW> Nekoj can role 2nd ;)
* Xandrea|TY Hugs Nek goodnight
<Aracnakat> Bye Nekoj .. thanks for coming :)
<Darious-SS> the random number generator is also hackable
<Duira_AP> night Xan
<Nekoj> You will most likely read my views on this during the week :-)
<Nahalen-R> PokePhrack: yea, its a problem
*** Madarch_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
*** Nekoj has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Thornsong> Ok so if they cheat they still get first pick of the month -- even the last person still gets to pick on the month
<Nahalen-R> The details are up for discussion obviously, but the idea is sound
<Kalorn-Albion> yeah but this is supposed to be based on trust
<Aracnakat> Hold that thought Drucilla .. lets see what we can work out :)
<Aracnakat> afk - door ;x
<Xandrea|TY> well we can do this.
<Nahalen-R> ALSO, each guild gets 2 slots max per month?
<Drucilla> Maybe it's something we can do in the future, if this model works out.
<Nahalen-R> or 1?
<Darious-SS> there has to be some sort of script that can pick a random name
*** PokePhrack is now known as Flare
<Xandrea|TY> we can just do this pick 1 time then rotate the guilds who get the pick
<Taloz-KoWW> 2 slots max maybe
<Thornsong> Have 2 rounds at first, 1 round and then go backwards
<Nahalen-R> so one guild, even if they cheat, is only getting a limited time
<Galar-SS> Each guild gets one shot at one event, if more left over have it go down the list?
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Xandrea|TY> if more left then re random I guess
*** Madarch_KoL has joined #CTC
*** tagnut has joined #CTC
<Darious-SS> duel for it LOL
<Thornsong> Have 2 rounds -- 1st people go first, then go backwards so the person who picked first in the first round, gets last in the second round
<Galar-SS> but I would say give everyone at least a chance at one plane event first then worry about the rest
<Taloz-KoWW> If more left after one round through, go backwards
<Taloz-KoWW> Like thornsong said
<Drucilla> that's a good idea Thorn/Taloz
<Taloz-KoWW> He said it better ;)
<Tishla_VG> you know... this is going to be A LOT of work for one person to keep track of
<Darious-SS> well we all agree on the meeting thing
<Xandrea|TY> yes it is.
<Madarch_KoL> We can go with that
<Xandrea|TY> but kat has friends :)
<Aracnakat> This comes from Ilyiana of SS to me via private message and athough I love the agreement we have here need to bring it up:
<Aracnakat> <Ilyiana-SS> Speak for me because I don't have time to invest in this meeting now - How does this new system address the problem with guilds inviting other guilds on their time slots, and big guilds and little guilds having the same 'vote'...etc =)
<Drucilla> Well, can it just be plugged into the calendar?
*** Idar-DoA has joined #CTC
<Nahalen-R> well once we organize the details, it'll be simple
<Xandrea|TY> yeah it can easy
<Thornsong> Any leftover space should be left open for people who did not get a chance to roll -- if we control all space 100 percent of the time it will cause problems
<Nahalen-R> and then once timeslots are picked, into the calendar they go
<Thornsong> That should be ffa time
* Drucilla VERY much agrees with Thornsong on that.
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Darious-SS> all able guilds have a vote
<Drucilla> Well all little guilds have to do is show up to solve that issue
<Darious-SS> and you can ally with whoever you want
<Kenji-Cohort> define able ...
<Taloz-KoWW> Anyone can invite whoever they want
<Thornsong> It doesnt really, but it guarantees each guild AT LEAST 2 blocks a month in the planes
<Drucilla> I'm a little teeny guild and this feels quite fair to me.
<Xandrea|TY> yeah if they read CTC you show up
<Darious-SS> the scheduling is totally random
<Aracnakat> I just want to say .. there were folks here that had a problem with the guilds sharing .. how does this address it, or is it a non-issue if we adopt this new system?
<Thornsong> That is fair as you are going to get it
<Nahalen-R> Well.. one thought I had, was that if Guild A B C are friends, and guild A and guild B get fear slots, they cant invite each other? just an idea
<Kenji-Cohort> it's not a non issue
<Kenji-Cohort> but everyone is running away from it
<Xandrea|TY> I like inviting my friends
<Drucilla> That is a question -- how do you limit number of "appearances" per month?  Can you?
<Kenji-Cohort> no one wants to work together
<Darious-SS> Nah bu that makes people suffer for friendship
<PikaStray> What about folks that have no idea what the hell a 'Cazic Thule Corner' is?
<Aliudyen-DA> yea i think its an issue and unlike Kenji i dont see people running away from it
<Taloz-KoWW> Let everyone invite who they want, I am not going to not invite my friends
<Sintin> yes one visit per person per plane a month
<Kalorn-Albion> we do need to address this as it seems that 'alliances' were the key issue with the problems in PoH a week last monday
<Sintin> but me shut up now till my que comes
<Xandrea|TY> I have a full box of crayons and damnit if im gonna color in my coloring book im not doing it alone.
<Taloz-KoWW> I tis impossible to regulate
<Darious-SS> with the random generating of time slots its all luck
<Aracnakat> Sintin .. you might as well speak now .. the que has gone to hell, although I do still have it
<Unitsi> !
<Taloz-KoWW> yep
<Unitsi> nm
<Drucilla> I think that that issue, of alliances, may just evaporate if ALL guilds are able in any given month to get a slot.
<Sintin> ok here goes please forgive my spelling
<Nahalen-R> Yea. I think we would probably fair better just ignoreing alliances
<Nahalen-R> but I was thinking of all bases :)
<Darious-SS> i mean just because guild a and b are friends doesnt mean they should suffer
<Drucilla> I mean, I came here with my it's-not-fair-I-have-to-wait-till-July-when-all-the-big-guilds-are-going-6-times-before-then attitude, but I think this quite fairly addresses it.
<Sintin> we all agree that the calendar has been exploited in the past except for the people exploiting it ;)
<Darious-SS> they should be able to work together and enjoy eachothers company
<Omalley-RK> aye, but it should be a guild w/aty least 1 plane capable grp
*** Madarch_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Darious-SS> Omalley but who truly determines that
<Sintin> I have seen and can prob name 20 people last month and probably this month who will kill multiple dragons and spend 20 plus days in a month in the planes
<Taloz-KoWW> I think to get on the random you should have 12 members 46+
<Omalley-RK> if we have guilds calling it that have 1 lvl 46+ getting the same chance people will bitch
<Tikiri> If they are working to gether enjoying each others company then they should be combined and given 1 slot between the 2 of them
<Drucilla> If I can invite whoever I want Omalley, why does my guild per se have to be plane capable?  This is a question...
<Aliudyen-DA> Yea reading the numbers EA had more than anyone in the planes
<Sintin> hmm thought i was up
<tagnut> u need 2 group even 3 for poh to be a GUILD camp
<Kalorn-Albion> personally I would love to - I have friends in all the 'big' guilds and when I organise a trip for Albion I want my friends there to help - but don't want them to suffer for it
<Taloz-KoWW> or be an alliance of at least 12 46+
<Aracnakat> ORDER ...
<Aracnakat> Lets allow Sintin to speak please :)
<Omalley-RK> dont get me wrong..
<Aliudyen-DA> sorry you asked a question :P
<Darious-SS> EA and EB enjoy hunting together just like Cn and DA do i dont see why they should be limited on that
<Aracnakat> -hehe- :)
*** Madarch_KoL has joined #CTC
<Sintin> ok ill say that again i can name 20 people who have done multiple dragon runs and spent 20 plus days a month in planes by jumping from guild to guild
*** tagnut has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Sintin> and newby 50th lvl people r begging to do a dragon run or a plane visit
<ShadeStorm> better not havbe me on that list ;>
<Darious-SS> Sintin but thats the guild who scheduleds problem
<Tikiri> If EB is there with EA for thier week in Said plane.. then EB should lose thier own personal slot
<Sintin> let me finish pls
<Darious-SS> i disagree
<Taloz-KoWW> Sintin, if the guilds will allow themselves to be used like that, its thier business
<Sintin> i agree guild a can invite john doe to help
<Drucilla> I disagree with that twoo Tikiri
<Darious-SS> thats making EB suffer for being EAs friend
<Sintin> but if john doe helps in pof then he is done for the month
<Tikiri> no it isnt  They are still getting thier time in the plane
<Tikiri> They are getting 1 week
<Sintin> he cant go help his own guild then guild c then do 3 dragon runs
<Mythral-CN> then you deny EB the right to organize a plane event as such...
<Nahalen-R> Sintin: impossible to police
<Sintin> which we all see happening
<ShadeStorm> its not 1 week
<Nahalen-R> totally impossible
<Tikiri> so is ea.. they chose to work together in the plane.. then combine thier slot
<ShadeStorm> its 3 days
<Xandrea|TY> HEY GUYS Sin has the floor
<Xandrea|TY> SHHHHHHH!
<Galar-SS> What if I have nothing to even get in that zone but want to have fun in there? and am invited?
<Taloz-KoWW> !
<Sintin> yes pls wait
* Xandrea|TY shackes her fist angrely!
<Tikiri> Whatever I was using Hypotheticals dont pick over every little word
<Sintin> so whats stopping me from creating multiple small guilds so i  can now get more random time slots for a month
<Mythral-CN> ?
<Tikiri> Exactly my point Sintin
<Drucilla> ?
<Mythral-CN> ?
<Omalley-RK> mine 2
<Thornsong> A sense of fairness Sintin
<Taloz-KoWW> We require at least a certain number of people
<Sintin> so now i have 5 guilds lets say i am friends with and tada i now have 5 bookings a month
<Sintin> ea should then split up into 5 guilds then
<Darious-SS> with a random generation of time slots you cant fault guilds for the "piggybacking"
<Sintin> because its being abused big time
<Aracnakat> (? Que = Taloz, Mythral, Drucilla)
<Omalley-RK> ?
<Tishla_VG> Guys im so sorry. I must leave =(
<Sintin> ok questions
<Aracnakat> Taloz ?
<Aliudyen-DA> I had one in there somewhere but Alot of it was coveredby taloz
<Darious-SS> ?
<Taloz-KoWW> Pigybacking is a non issue, time is the guilds to do with what they want
<Duira_AP> be well Tishla
<Xandrea|TY> See you Tishla :)
<Aracnakat> Bye Tishla .. thanks for coming :)
<Drucilla> bye Tish
<Sintin> ok then we will now have 5 guilds booking slots and sharing
<Kenji-Cohort> Seeya Tishla
<Taloz-KoWW> A minimum 12 46+ should be required to get on the random list
<Sintin> because that is what other guilds r doing and it is BS
<Taloz-KoWW> or an alliance that can field such
<Nahalen-R> How about this.. we agree on a rough system first, then work out the fine details? were never going to finish a system if we pick apart every detail before we know what were making
<Thornsong> 18
<Tikiri> I TOTALLY agree Sintin
<Dalmi-DoA> *waves at Tishla*
<Xandrea|TY> AGree Nah.
<Omalley-RK> aye, sign up as a solo guild or an alliance
<Taloz-KoWW> 12, 18 flexible there myself
<Taloz-KoWW> 18 might be better
<Drucilla> But what is more important, that other guilds don't "get away with" something, or that OUR guilds get a fair shot?
<Aliudyen-DA> Do we want to define what constitutes a "planes" ready guild by a set number?
<Xandrea|TY> 18 is fine.
<Darious-SS> Well you can make the condition of if you have the ability to speak the plane inhouse you dont fall under that limitation...but who defines who can and cant do a plan inhouse
<Taloz-KoWW> simplest way to do it Ali
<Aliudyen-DA> This should at least minimize this effect
*** Tishla_VG has left #CTC
<Xandrea|TY> brb need to go afk :)
<Darious-SS> err speak = break
<Sintin> sintin would love to be limited to 4 days in pof..but when i see people spending 15 days in a row in pof jumping from guild to guild and u tell me this is fair
<Omalley-RK> afk min phone
<Darious-SS> Sintin but thats the host guilds problem
<Taloz-KoWW> Agreed Darious
<Flare> Has anyong considered Angturils proposal?
<Tikiri> its monopoly
<Drucilla> We need to limit ourselves to righting a very specific set of wrongs here, NOT deciding guild's membership or alliance policies!
<Duira_AP> no standards for who is "ready". if they want to die it's their $10 plus recovery costs
<Darious-SS> if SS has PoF blocked and invites 12y along then CC has it the next block and invites 12y along thats not an issue as i see it
<Taloz-KoWW> No standards is to easy to exploit
<Sintin> yes it is cause the newby lvl 50 that dont have a big enough guild cant go
<Drucilla> I agree Darious.  It is an issue NOW because no other guilds can get a slot till July, but under the new system, it's totally fair.
<Aliudyen-DA> Not really Flare I "Want " to hunt with my guild and the way guk and sol are planes are one of the few times i can do this with my primary at least and i dont think Angturils proposal is condusive to this
<Sintin> because they r not in the click
<Tikiri> no the issue is Guild X taking a block and inviting Y and Z then Guild Y getting a block and inviting X and Z and then Z getting a block and inviting X and y
<Nahalen-R> Sintin: the newbie level 50 cant go as it is anyways
*** Sintin has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Drucilla> But Tikiri, they can't have any MORE slots than one per guild until all the other guilds have a slot, too.
<Nahalen-R> cause a "newbie" level 50 isnt gonna be in a guild that gets invited to the planes anyways
<Darious-SS> but Tikiri with random generation of timeslots theres no guarantee of that
<Tikiri> there for you have the same 40 people taking up 3 blocks when one guil of 50 only gets 1 block
<Flare> Yea, it's not Aliudyen, but I don't think hunting PoF/PoH as a guild is a long term viable option
<Drucilla> Tikiri, then form your own guild alliances and double your guild time, too.  There's nothing to prevent it.
<Drucilla> We can't penalize people for enjoying hunting together.
*** Sintin has joined #CTC
<Aliudyen-DA> aye this is more an overcrowding issue and the planes are my last vestige of guildhood :P
<PikaStray> If you want to play this damn game and have time in the planes, you shouldn't be forced to make huge multi-guild alliances.
<Tikiri> Thats fine but they are considered in my opinion and many others  one unit as compaired to 3 seperates
<Darious-SS> well it will be obvious if someones using an exploit as such
<Aracnakat> Mythral ?
<Sintin> they have been doing it and it will continue
<Darious-SS> but to be honest if we all work togther on an agreement i dont see this happening
<Thornsong> But all the calendar does is ensure you get 3 days in each plane per month.  If you can work in more through alliances good for you
<Drucilla> But Tikiri, you may not like that someone is going to the planes 3x with 3 different guilds, but under the new scheme, how does it HURT you?
<Tikiri> NONON
<Mythral-CN> yeah Darious just answered it... Sintin is bringing up the problem of guilds voluntarily splitting to get more time slots, but those guilds are made of individuals...
<Drucilla> You will now have COMPLETELY equal opportunity.  We can only make decisions to give us all equal *opportunity* to plane time here, not equal **time* in the planes.
<Tikiri> 3 times with the 3 SAME guilds
<Tikiri> using 3 DIFFERENT blocks
<Sintin> this punishes the big guilds and the small guilds r lauighing..so i advise ea to split up into 5 or 6 groups then
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Tikiri> as seperates when in all TRUTHJ they arent being seperate
<Darious-SS> but Tikir in the long run doesnt that solve the problem
<Drucilla> Again, Tikiri, how does this in any way HURT you?
<Tikiri> they are using each other to get more time
<Mythral-CN> most lvl 50s know each others and that would be easy to trace out, so I don't see that as much of a problem
<Xandrea|TY> but tiki if ea had, friends, it wouldent be as big an issue???
<Darious-SS> that means 3 guilds will be in full EQ and not be there
<Xandrea|TY> no offense.
<Tikiri> this in a way hurts me because we are getting 1 block for the SAME ammount of people as they are getting 3 for
<Tikiri> THIS is the Problem
<Xandrea|TY> but it promotes friendship and sharing.
<Drucilla> No Darious, it wouldn't work that way --- under the new scheme
<Tikiri> EA Does Have friends Xandrea
<ShadeStorm> why tikiri, because you cant form an alliance?
<Nahalen-R> Tikiri: and NO system at all will stop that
<Darious-SS> lets stop the name calling
<Drucilla> Those 3 guilds would each get 1 slot for every one slot every other guild gets.
<Mythral-CN> so Tikiri you're adivisng guilds shouldn't hunt on planes with their friends ???
<Galar-SS> Then have your friends book a slot and join then
<Xandrea|TY> Will do Darious.
<Darious-SS> god did i saw that
<Darious-SS> err say
<Nahalen-R> we can NOT limit people based on alliances, no one will ever agree to a system that does
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Thornsong> That was my suggestion last meeting Sintin if you look at the notes - I agree bigger guild gets unequal time per member
<Drucilla> Therefore, NO time is taken away from Tikiri's guild.  In fact, Tikiri can form a guild alliance and triple his personal plane time too, WITHOUT taking time away from any other guilds.
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Aracnakat> I want to point out a few things ...
<Darious-SS> Eb and EA hunt together all the time now none of us would have an issue if Eb and EA scheduled backt o back blocks
<Aracnakat> ORDER
*** Dragosani has joined #CTC
*** Moonraider-EA has joined #CTC
<Aracnakat> First off ... tracking who has alliances with who .. would be a nightmare .. and a task that I personally will not be responsible for
<Aracnakat> So consider this when you are arguing this point ..
<Galar-SS> take care folks, time for me to go back to my hotel :)
<Xandrea|TY> Night Galar.
*** Galar-SS is now known as Galar
<Taloz-KoWW> laters Galar
<Omalley-RK> nite
<Darious-SS> how much she cost this time Galar?
<Tullus> back to aol #teenchat, bye
*** Tullus has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Madarch_KoL> DOH
<Aracnakat> Secondly ... (Night Galar) The calendar .. or any system we come up with here is about SHARING .. SHARING ... if Guild A & B have an alliance I personally say Good for them .. they have figure out how to SHARE
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
*** Dragosani has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Darious-SS> bingo
<Nahalen-R> exactly
<kodi-sleep> hi?
<Sintin> so work on honor system you been in plane of pof for one session admit it you done..or maybe guild at end of session can post a list of all who participated
<kodi-sleep> omg
<kodi-sleep> its still going
<Aracnakat> LOL Hiya Kodi 
<ShadeStorm> if ya allowing other guilds, just limit it to one two groups total
<Xandrea|TY> hehe hi kodi! :)
<Drucilla> no Sintin, nobody's gonna agree to that.
<kodi-sleep> omg.. i woulda never stayed awake this long
<kodi-sleep> 10.30 and my moms already woken me up 5 times and ive fallen back asleep
<Xandrea|TY> lol kodi.
<Nahalen-R> something I had in my notepad from 2 hours ago: This is more about cooperation and not being greedy than how we go about doing it.
<Darious-SS> i like the idea of a calendar but i totally disagree with saying you cant invite your friends or they suffer later
<Xandrea|TY> anyhow guys, good luck on agreement if I can come back I will. for now I have to go :)
<Darious-SS> this games all about friends
<Drucilla> Cooperation and sharing isn't anything we can legislate.  It's impractical, and NOT our place.
<kodi-sleep> seeya!
<Xandrea|TY> Kat please send me your log, later on! :)
<Omalley-RK> this is the one thing i request from everone...civility, if we can manage that we will be fine;)
<Taloz-KoWW> bye kodi
<Aracnakat> Will do Xan .. hope it holds 4 hours worth of text :) (Night Xan and Kodi)
* PikaStray hugs Xandrea buh-bye.
<Xandrea|TY> haw hehe
<Karn-RP> Why should anyone be penalized because they can share, assist and have fun with others outside thier guild?
<Tikiri> How would they be paying for it?  they are getting their week in the planes allied with another guild
<Darious-SS> exactly
* Xandrea|TY gives everyone a kiss and hug goodbye
<Sintin> you guys just dont see it...its ok for one guy to spend 20 plus days in the planes and do multiple dragon runs and newby lvl 50 guys r begging for a chance and you wont let them in
<Duira_AP> be well Xan
<Drucilla> Yes, Sintin, it means THEY have made friends.  YOU can make friends too.
<kodi-sleep> i see your point sintin
<Darious-SS> but why should they lose they week in the planes because theyre friends
<Aracnakat> Sintin, all the newbie lvl 50 guy has to do .. is ask??
*** Galar has quit IRC (EOF from client)
*** PikaFlare has joined #CTC
<kodi-sleep> was like that for me till i went out a bit more and annoyed a few more people
<Tikiri> Darious if it wasnt for thier "friends' which are trhe same 20+ people EVERY SIngLE tmie
<kodi-sleep> started with a fg raid with TY
<Sintin> and the reply from most the guilds is get lost
<Tikiri> they couldnt do the damn plane
<Nahalen-R> Sintin: a system/calendar does not change the fact that a "newbie" level 50 will have a hard time getting into a plane
<Moonraider-EA> Guys it basically comes down to either a FFA where noone has fun or compromise so we all can :)
<Aliudyen-DA> Aye i see it as well i think the new level 50 actually benefits mor ethis way than he would by your proposal though
<Drucilla> Sintin, you can come with my alliance if you can't get in with anyone else.
<Thornsong> We let up like 7 people I had no clue who they were in Fear -- and 3 or 4 of them got loot
*** Xandrea|TY has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<ShadeStorm> ok, so your saying because ss can clear the planes solo....we invite zero, yet are friends with TONS of guilds, yet they cannot come for risk of losing there slot?
<Darious-SS> and Kat this flashing banner at the bottom of the screen is about to make me have a psychotic episode hehe
<Taloz-KoWW> Sintin - Make friends
*** Flare is now known as Flare_In_EQ
<Aracnakat> roflmao! I'm sorry Darious :(
<Drucilla> I think we've beat this issue to death, it has little support?
<Nahalen-R> A system/calendar will not put a non-guilded person at a disadvanage to getting into a plane any more than FFA planes
<Sintin> this is the biggest issue tho ;(
<Darious-SS> this works well for everyone and encourages working together
<Omalley-RK> i guess there is no real way to police the alliance thing...
<Aracnakat> ORDER ..
<Tikiri> It works for the people that Agree...
<ShadeStorm> ill agree the alliance issue is the biggest issue
<Drucilla> It's the bigger issue of society Sintin, and we're not gonna solve it tonight :-)
<kodi-sleep> being unguilded or a small guild is a disadvantage
<Aracnakat> I want to give some people who have waited patiently for hours for a turn to speak ...
<Aracnakat> ORDER
-Darious-SS- (Private) ease up this is a good discussion and its getting shit done
<Aracnakat> Okie .. this discussion is a good one .. 
<Drakyn_EA> Ok Kat.. I gotta say something about your newbie level 50 guy all he has to do is ask.. a couple months I was a newbie level 50 guys.. I asked CN/DA/SS when they were hunting hate if I could join in.. and was basically told to stuff it ;)
<Aracnakat> and is working well .... sorry ... just want others to be heard who have been waiting patiently
<Drakyn_EA> And I was IN hate at the time
<Aracnakat> Sorry to hear that Drakyn .... but I've seen many "unknowns" get into the planes with the above mentioned guilds
<Darious-SS> but that was the choice made by them
<Drakyn_EA> Oh.. I wasn't EA at the time either ;p
<Dalmi-DoA> Question: can you define Newbie lvl 50 for me?
<Aracnakat> Kenji is up
<Darious-SS> did you consider why they said no?
*** Idar-DoA has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<ShadeStorm> ever think it was you that the problem happened?
<kodi-sleep> dalmi: a new level 50 who knows the wrong people
<kodi-sleep> like i did
<Drakyn_EA> Yeah, because I had happened to group with CC one time in hate
<Kenji-Cohort> I know Dalmi
<Drakyn_EA> And that is an exact quote
<Dalmi-DoA> i know Kenji
<ShadeStorm> from?
* kodi-sleep mutters.. never do a pickup efreeti raid
<Drakyn_EA> Lawana
<Taloz-KoWW> Look you can't get in the planes without friends, that's life we can't change that
<Taloz-KoWW> Move on please
*** Idar-DoA has joined #CTC
<ShadeStorm> so ya didnt bother asking ss, yet clump the together
<Drakyn_EA> You were all up ther etogether and I asked for over an hour
<Kenji-Cohort> Let me know when I'm clear
<Drakyn_EA> The answer stayed the same
<Darious-SS> the thing is there is the question of why dont you have friends
*** Phrosticles is now known as Phrost-AFK
<Tikiri> WEll DA couldnt make a move on working with EA unless they had the consent of CN
<Omalley-RK> whoa guys, personal guild diputes, not the issue here
<Aliudyen-DA> I dont think SS and CN/DA were hunting together mor than passingly 2 months ago
<Darious-SS> btw that wasnt directed at anyone
<Tikiri> talk to Xoushi and Miasma on that one form ore information
<Taloz-KoWW> Move on please
<Darious-SS> more at Taloz comment
<kodi-sleep> oh come on
<kodi-sleep> i had friends, but i outlevelled them all and they were unknown also
<ShadeStorm> cn and ss were neutral to each other 2 months ago
<Aracnakat> Kenji has the floor please :)
<ShadeStorm> hell the first month we totally hated each other
<Darious-SS> hehe
<Aliudyen-DA> Actually Tiki i was working late that night or there would have been no questions and its it over things said to CN members.  these are my friends and i will back them up :P
<Drakyn_EA> Look. My comment wasn't an accusation it was an observation on what Kat said about all they have to do is ask
<Taloz-KoWW> It is more than just asking, it's making friends who are of the right level, move on
<Drakyn_EA> I've seen non-guilded new planes level people shot down time and again
<Darious-SS> to be honest it does depend on theyre view of you
<Tikiri> No this is when both guilds were there working with each other
*** Thornsong has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Kenji-Cohort> At some point the past has to become the past people must move on
<Darious-SS> lets move on from that
<Darious-SS> i mean this is now that was 2 months ago
<kodi-sleep> sintin: work on your image, i did, and people like me now =)
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Drakyn_EA> It was an observation on Kat's point is all. I'm holding no grudges over it.
<Taloz-KoWW> Let Kenji Talk!
<Idar-DoA> I like Sintin'
<Kenji-Cohort> My view on the Calendar is basically the same as my post on the Tavern
<Darious-SS> the banner is asking me who the hell i am
<kodi-sleep> ok, work on it so people think you're great company and when they need entertainment youll be invited
<Kenji-Cohort> I believe the calendar works if you want to make it work
<Nahalen-R> Taloz said it best, nothing can change the fact that a person with few friends in the game will have a next to impossible time to getting into a plane. nothing.
<Sintin> thanx idar
<Darious-SS> well Nah 1 thing can
<Darious-SS> that person can try to change for the better
<Tikiri> Taloz then you send yourself and your friends to an EA camp...   you will be welcomed
<Kenji-Cohort> I cannot speak for bad blood between guilds but Cohort has had no problems getting to the Planes even tho we were shut out the Feb and March mostly
<Nahalen-R> Well of course, :)
<Drucilla> Well, I am happy to take the guildless and the friendless into my baby alliance -- send me a tell.
*** Korelin-CTC has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Aracnakat> Kenji has the floor please :)
<Kenji-Cohort> All I needed to do was ask and communicate
<Taloz-KoWW> EA camps are a mixed bag, not saying more ;p
<Drakyn_EA> LOL. Umm Darious.. change for the better? Who is to say they were a bad person to begin with?
<Aracnakat> Kenji has the floor please :)
<Darious-SS> well your reputation is about all ya got in this game thats real
<Tikiri> EA camps are allways mixed,  People log off inthe plane.. they log on and they are welcomed
<Kenji-Cohort> I honestly do not know why people cannot work together on this calendar.
<Nahalen-R> I have a feeling darious used the wrong words, but his meaning was correct... but lets let Kenji talk please
<Kenji-Cohort> I wish I could mend the rift between SS/DA/CN/EA ... and in fact I tried
<kodi-sleep> screw guild politics, im nice to everyone even if my guild hates them
<Tikiri> Kenji you will never get EA and CN to work together as guilds no matter what you try
<Kenji-Cohort> but that does not change the fact that we all need to put forth some effort to try and make this work.
<Moonraider-EA> i would just like to say something i dont have a problem with guilds i have a problem with some people in some of the guilds ;>
<PikaStray> You have 2 hours to figure this out, or we are taking over.
<Drakyn_EA> lol
<Moonraider-EA> and yes, i was here for the EA CN split and there seems to be alot of bad blood between the guilds for some reason
<Aracnakat> Kenji .. done? (let me know) :)
<Moonraider-EA> LOL Strya
<Darious-SS> but cant we all b e friends Stray ;)
<Kenji-Cohort> I will Kat
<Mythral-CN> if you speak in your own name Tikiri as you stated earlier why do you profess such bland statements ? is it gonna make things any better also ?
<Dalmi-DoA> There is a weakness to this Calendar. Some Guilds that is Plane ready might never visited to this place.
<PikaStray> I thought her staements spicy and full of vigor.
<Tikiri> Mythral dont you even start with me..  I know why you have a problem with me
<Taloz-KoWW> They have to be contacted in game..
<Kenji-Cohort> I don't think we need to be friends but we need to try and work together.  I'll state here that all are welcome to Cohort camps and will be treated fairly
<Aracnakat> ORDER - Kenji has the floor :)
<Moonraider-EA> what it basically comes down to is make it fair or declare it a FFA
<Nahalen-R> Could I propose a vote? A vote that a lottery system is the most likely thing to work out fairly... details can be worked out even at a later date.. but some obvious progress is good :)
<Kenji-Cohort> just contact me in game first to arrange things.
<Moonraider-EA> cyas have fun ;>
<Darious-SS> but if those plane ready guilds were having problems wouldnt they be here already?
<kodi-sleep> where the hell are my shoes
<Drucilla> I second Nahalan
*** Moonraider-EA has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Aliudyen-DA> I dont think so as per what was discussed earlier on,  right now we seem to need to "difine " piggybacking or is this just guilds inviting the company of their friends and how this effects guilds /people with few friends than others
<PikaStray> Just to interject here.....as per Verant guidelines....FFA is the ONLY way to do this.
<Drakyn_EA> Kenji I will say this for CC. The few times I was hunting with them on raids before I joined EA I felt quite welcomed
<Taloz-KoWW> There is no piggybacking, people invite there friends if they want
<Darious-SS> Verant has theyre heads up another oriface
<Kenji-Cohort> I would like the current calendar to stay as it is.  If a guild or guilds want time I think it can be worked out
<Drucilla> Okay, could CC give up a slot in April to us? :-)
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<PikaStray> Actually, Darious, they have their heads set for free will to do what you please.
<Kenji-Cohort> Drucilla, why not come up with us?
<Nahalen-R> Not everyone wants to use the help of another "big" guild to execute a break
<Kenji-Cohort> You'll have to trust that we'll treat you fairly
<Drucilla> Because I want to go with my own guild alliance.
<ShadeStorm> but do want to learn from said guilds normally
<Drucilla> I've been treated "fairly" by CC too recently.
<Nahalen-R> And as it is, the planes are booked up till 2035
<Nahalen-R> that isnt going to work
<Aliudyen-DA> But everyone is Nahalen,  try going in on a full spawn when your not logged in there :P its 3-4 hours of exp loss and death as a rule :P
<Darious-SS> if we institute the new system april on will be wiped
<Darious-SS> only march is reserved atm
<Kenji-Cohort> Then trim the blocks back, to open more slots and let guilds that have no time scheduled that month come in
<Nahalen-R> Aliudyen-DA: honestly, I'd like to do it at least once
<ShadeStorm> april is wiped to those who have time in march and those already there in april with no time stay there
<Drakyn_EA> With the exception of Tishla's VG raid in April
<Darious-SS> thats why all march blocked people do not have blocks in april Kenji
<Nahalen-R> I dont care if I fail miserably, I want to say I tried and had fun
<Kenji-Cohort> And as for wiping the calendar.  Not until post expansion.  Cohort has waited for April to arrive
<Aracnakat> The point is Nahalen (at least IMO) your guild should have a shot to Fail :)
<Drakyn_EA> One thing I gotta stress folks. Lets keep mobs like the Efreeti off the dang calendar
<Taloz-KoWW> Question
<Darious-SS> but Kenji did you have plane scheduled in march?
<Duira_AP> exactly Nahalen
<Drucilla> Kenji, Cohort would not lose it's April slot if it has no March slot.
<Taloz-KoWW> Kenji did CC schedule march?
<Kenji-Cohort> Hate and somehow we have *1* day in Fear in March
<Drucilla> and you would still get an April slot according to your lottery order.
*** Madarch_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Darious-SS> you didnt reserve any blocks in march so your april blocks arent touched
<Darious-SS> blocks not days
<kodi-sleep> screw big camps, and guild politics... i want to go with other people and meet new people
<Darious-SS> block = mon thurs fri sun
<Taloz-KoWW> 1 day isnt a block, your april would remain
<Drucilla> then CC doesn't lose it's slot in April
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Nahalen-R> If you had no slots in march, then your april slots are untouched if we go that way
<Taloz-KoWW> as you've said, CC waited a long time, no fair to take your april
<Nahalen-R> thats only fair
<Darious-SS> EB has 1 day scheduled in PoF this month but they wouldnt forfiet theyre april block unless they reserved a full block
*** Madarch_KoL has joined #CTC
<Kenji-Cohort> While the lottery system has merits, we should try and talk to each other about the Planes
<Darious-SS> babysteps Kenji
<Kenji-Cohort> I can honestly say that it's been worth the work to build better relations
<Kenji-Cohort> instead of taking my time and running with it
<Darious-SS> i mean lets face it alot of the talk lately has been 4 letter words and insults
<kodi-sleep> seeeyas
<Taloz-KoWW> yes, I agree lottery is a step, maybe someday we wont need it
<Aracnakat> Bye Kodi :)
<Drucilla> Kenji, relations are great, but I don't think that ALL guilds should HAVE to go with one of the big 5 as their only way to a plane.
<Duira_AP> night again kodi
<Kenji-Cohort> They don't, Drucilla
<Unitsi> Niight Kodi
<Darious-SS> oh please can we not do the Big 5 thing
<Drucilla> And my option is...?
<Drucilla> Oh, my option is July.
<Drakyn_EA> lol. More like the big 40 now days ;p
<Kenji-Cohort> Look at the calendar, lots of small guilds on there.  Cohort was late in signing up but we did not complain
*** kodi-sleep has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Drucilla> I pulled Big 5 out of my head, I couldn't even name them.
<Kenji-Cohort> We took the time we could and worked out things with others
<Darious-SS> so does everyone agree on the wiping of april for blocked guilds in march?
<Taloz-KoWW> whos #5 it used to be 4 hehe
<Madarch_KoL> yes
<Taloz-KoWW> DArious YEs
<Mythral-CN> Errr Dru, you're still up in April and Kenji invites you on their time... what is possibly wrong with that ?
<Duira_AP> thought we already agreed on that
<Drucilla> I'm not up in April.
<Drucilla> I'm up in July.
<Kenji-Cohort> I'm not for wiping the calendar until after the expansion comes out
<Darious-SS> ok now does everyone agree that the lottery system needs to be worked on BUT could work well
<Kenji-Cohort> the calendar is actually working
<Drakyn_EA> Dru.. April is going to be wiped and everything after that unless you don't have a block scheduled in march
<Madarch_KoL> What if expansion gets postponed./
<Duira_AP> we voted already
<Mythral-CN> ah that's another... well anyway point is moot with the wipe, you get a chance in April as any other
<Madarch_KoL> ?
<Omalley-RK> ack guys i gotta run, am at home and the lil sis needs to do the hw thing:(
<Kenji-Cohort> example, EA and Relentless negotiated to get EA in Hate during Relentless time
<Darious-SS> then heh if we voted why we still here
<Drucilla> Yes I know, I support that plan totally, Kenji doesn't, I was debating why I do with him.
<Omalley-RK> gluvk on rest of the discussion;)
<Aracnakat> Bye Omalley, thanks for coming :)
<Duira_AP> thought we voted on the wipe, not the rest
<Madarch_KoL> Worry about the expansion when it comes
*** Omalley-RK has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Darious-SS> Kenji the calendar is working for some but others feel slighted by this
<Aracnakat> We voted on allowing the guilds never there before to remine .. but that was only IF we agreed on wiping :)
<Aracnakat> remain ;x
<Darious-SS> the monthly meeting will allow the negotiations
<Darious-SS> it is limited in its attendance
<Aliudyen-DA> i think any planes after expansion are moot in that the game will become larger and quite possible large enough to accomodate the people we have on the server.  whether this is going to last short term or long term remains to be seen
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Darious-SS> 2 reps from each guild
<Nahalen-R> the calendar in its current form is not really working. Its helping but its hurting people too
<Kenji-Cohort> We were slighted but look at how we reacted
<Darious-SS> you reacted well
<Aracnakat> Kenji, I do want to point something out ...
<Darious-SS> and with this plan you will keep they days you waited so long for
<Kenji-Cohort> I'm not in this for myself, Darious
<Aracnakat> You took the bull by the horns and took action ... WELL DONE!  .. but sadly, most will not do this .. either because they don't have the time, the skills or the courage
<Kenji-Cohort> I believe that through communication the calendar works
<Darious-SS> maybe down the road Kenji
<Darious-SS> right now its not working
<Kenji-Cohort> We're on the road now
<Darious-SS> exactly
<Madarch_KoL> and there are trees in the path
<Madarch_KoL> that we're clering
<Darious-SS> maybe a bit farther down we can change it again
<Taloz-KoWW> Aye, I would like to see it eventually with no lotto
<Darious-SS> aye
<Taloz-KoWW> A goal to work towards 
<Nahalen-R> we cant just sit back and expect things to work out, an hour ago everyone was at each others throats, simple communication doesn't seem to be working for everyone, wish it did though
<Drucilla> Do we have something that can be articulated for us to vote on?
<Aracnakat> Okie .. I want to table two discussions for a moment .. 1) Meeting & Lottery (combined discussion) 2) Let it remain (Kenji) .. so that others waiting can voice their opinions ..k?
<Kenji-Cohort> Ok, I'll be done :)
<Aracnakat> Everyone mind us allowing those who have waited for hours to have a moment?
<Taloz-KoWW> Who's up?
<Aracnakat> Aliudyen you are up .. i fyou have something more to add
<Aracnakat> (something different I should say)
<Aliudyen-DA> Actually Taloz expressed most of what i wanted to say at the moment in that we need to do this 1 month at a time with all present
<Aracnakat> OKie .. thanks Ali
<Darious-SS> ya know once everyone stopped going for the jugular this became a working discussion
<Aracnakat> Tikiri, you are up .. anything new that hasn't been discussed? :)
<Aracnakat> Agreed Darious :)
<Aliudyen-DA> that and we may need to difine piggybacking with a number.  say guoilds of 18+ 46 + pof capable can book or alliances if thats the case
<Duira_AP> cause we have little blood left )
<Tikiri> that is because only those that Agree with it are the only ones speaking
<Kenji-Cohort> Hm so the lottery is only for April?
<Aracnakat> LOL Duira
<Drakyn_EA> Problem is Darious.. getting everyone that was here initially to work together. Half those people have left unfortunately personall issues get in the way ;/
<Duira_AP> pain and suffering is catching up
<Darious-SS> if you dont agree speak and offer a different solution
<Taloz-KoWW> only for april
<Darious-SS> lets hear your solution Tikiri
<Taloz-KoWW> Yes, we're listening
<Aliudyen-DA> well kanji we do april.  then may but at this time we add more people not the system monthly but the sign ups monthly to accomodate up and coming guilds
<Aracnakat> Tikiri, did you have a solution to offer up? :)
<Tikiri> there have been other solutions offered and there have been personal Attacks when they DID speak up
<Darious-SS> thats not a solution
<Darious-SS> you say this is bad offer something better
<Tikiri> read back through the logs
<Sintin> being a gnome i am used to personal attacks
<Aracnakat> -hehe- Sintin :)
<Darious-SS> thats a birthright for a gnome
<Madarch_KoL> Some of us get booted and dont have the logs
<Tikiri> My only Solution is pure unadulterated respect
<Nahalen-R> heh
<Tikiri> No "policing"
<Darious-SS> and a monthly meeting doesnt offer that?
<Tikiri> no Training when someone doesnt do what you want
<Taloz-KoWW> agreed so far
<Taloz-KoWW> :)
<ShadeStorm> seems you want it ffa
<Tikiri> No more goddamn "Teaching guild X a lesson through training" the only lesson that guild learns is how to Violate TOS agreement without getting Banned
<Nahalen-R> that doesn't really offer order over FFA. a schedualed timeslot helps small guilds whom need time to contact alliances
<Taloz-KoWW> Plain and simple, nobody should be training over this calendar
<Aracnakat> Agreed, that was never the intent
<Darious-SS> if everyone attends the meeting agrees and follows the schedule noone should bump elbows hence problem solved
<Drakyn_EA> Shade, thats not what she is saying. But listen to your comment just now. Not having to be policed with trains means an FFA to you?
<Taloz-KoWW> I know it happened in the past, let go, that is not what we want here
<ShadeStorm> no
<Tikiri> weather they agree or disagree with the Calendar it is those peoples rights to have thier own opinion and follow what they believe
<Mythral-CN> ok I'm out, I'm tired of hearing EA, and Tikiri especially, rehashing the damn "Train" thing over and over, sorry guys
<ShadeStorm> i just see the loophole
<Tikiri> they should not be trained because of it
<Aracnakat> Night Mythral .. thanks for comin' :)
<Duira_AP> does that mean that everyone here agrees to no more trains Darious?
<Darious-SS> so Tikiri are you saying you will choose to follow the Calendar when you wish?
*** Mythral-CN has left #CTC
<Darious-SS> and you dont think people should stand up and say no thats wrong
<Taloz-KoWW> Will EA work with everyone else, or not?
<Aliudyen-DA> actually Tiki if its the "hate" incident i was tild by my guild that EA trained us when i logged on :P so maybe thats just in the eye of the beholder
<Aliudyen-DA> training is wrongon that i think we all agree
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Tikiri> Ali EA trained noone  they were already in the zone
<Aliudyen-DA> well more came in :P
<Duira_AP> I wanna hear everone say that for the log though Alid
<Darious-SS> answer Taloz question please Tikiri?
<Tikiri> They couldnt have trained unless they trained themself but this is a personal matter
<Taloz-KoWW> Drop the training already, EVERYONE agrees it's wrong
<Drakyn_EA> LOL Ali. EA was there when DA/CN showed up and ran through our camp
<Aliudyen-DA> and could have very well trained i dont think they did however
<ShadeStorm> yea, like lonzo and his temple run in fear
<Nahalen-R> why is this train issue still up? thats in the PAST and not helping what we need to discuss now
<Tikiri> No Im saying learn from mistakes
<Drakyn_EA> Lonzo is no longer part of EA, Shade
<Duira_AP> its still up because there are post that it will continue
<Aliudyen-DA> because its been brought up by Tikiri so it must need clarification
<Kenji-Cohort> What loophole, Shades?
<ShadeStorm> loophole is simple
<Darious-SS> will EA follow the calendar that 99% of the guilds are here agreeing works
<Aliudyen-DA> Im not so sure anyone :intentionally: trained anyone
<ShadeStorm> basically those who get to the plane first wins
<Aracnakat> Tikiri, I believe that everyone here is in agreement that whatever happened in the past needs to remain in the past .. and we can strive to move on from here .. TRAINING is / was / always will be .. wrong.
<Tikiri> The reason I was given for the train was to show EA a lesson that they need to do by the calendar
<ShadeStorm> i.e. ffa
<Drakyn_EA> Darious EA has pretty closely followed the calendar except for two incidents
<Taloz-KoWW> Tikiri if that is so it was wrong, everyone here agrees
<Darious-SS> still havent answered the question Tikiri
<Aliudyen-DA> who offered that reasoning?
<Taloz-KoWW> Will EA work with everyone else, or not?
<Tikiri> This is *THE* reason Im not for the Calendar
<Tikiri> was because MANY MANY people lost alot of XP because they didnt agree with others
<Darious-SS> but if allg uilds follow it there should be no trains
<Taloz-KoWW> Nobody should be trained over this, that is not what the calendar is about!
<PikaStray> EA will work within the confines of a fair system.
<ShadeStorm> but tikiri its that loophole ya want
<Tikiri> Darious that sounds like a Threat to me
<Duira_AP> what does that mea darious?
<Tikiri> IF they agree then there wont be trains
<Darious-SS> no its a fact Tikiri
<Taloz-KoWW> GAH
*** PikaStray is now known as Straylite-EA
<Tikiri> Well Then I know where your comming from
<Duira_AP> My point
<Dalmi-DoA> im going to bed. cya
<Darious-SS> because if we all agree we wont be bumping elbows
<Taloz-KoWW> Quit being so paranoid
<Aracnakat> Night Dalmi .. thanks for coming ;)
<Aliudyen-DA> Trains will happen when more than 1 groups is close to another in planes.  its unfortunate they are not designed better imho
<Aracnakat> Tikiri, what then is your solution to the current problems? :)
<Darious-SS> if EA has PoH blocked noone but who they invite will come
<Aliudyen-DA> but if we know they are there
<Kenji-Cohort> Seeya Dalmi
<Tikiri> Darious Im talknig intentional training
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Ping timeout)
<Aliudyen-DA> we can talk and maybe miss the train :P
<Tikiri> to those that didnt "go with the flow"
<Darious-SS> well i dont train intentionally
<Darious-SS> thats in the past
<Tikiri> I never said *you* did
<Aracnakat> Tikiri, what then is your solution to the current problems? :)
<Darious-SS> let lying dogs sleep
*** Dalmi-DoA has quit IRC (Signed Off)
<Straylite-EA> Sleeping dogs lie you frigging moron.
<Madarch_KoL> We're OFF our subject
<Darious-SS> a solution to the problems weve had the past month are on the table
<Madarch_KoL> Please come back
<Drakyn_EA> Lets look at it this way. As long as there is a calendar and someone that doesn't follow it then there will be someone else that thinks the people who aren't following it should be taught a lesson
<Darious-SS> what was that about clogging the wheels of change with petty insults Stray?
<Aliudyen-DA> That was very uncalled for Stray
<Straylite-EA> Darious - I have been sitting here listening to everyone EA bash for a while now.  I am tired of it.
<Tikiri> The only Solution I can offer is for people to just respect each other. and respect the fact that not everyone thinks like you do (you being those that want a calendar and lottery and other ways to tell people what they can or cannot do)
<ShadeStorm> so you want the planes ffa
<Aliudyen-DA> No more name calling :P at least on this :personal" a level pleast
<Darious-SS> then why are you sitting there why dont you offer something constructive
<Aracnakat> I too interpret that as FFA Tikiri ... 
<Nahalen-R> Tikiri: are you saying the planes should be FFA?
<Straylite-EA> We are not a sub par guild.  We are just as good as the rest of you, and I refuse to be relegated to 'backburner' status.
<Darious-SS> huh
<Madarch_KoL> So why dont we leave an open block or week or whatever for those guilds that do not want to participate in the lottery?
<ShadeStorm> damn stray, we never said you werent
<Taloz-KoWW> Tikri your proposal of FFA will not be accepted by the server
<Aracnakat> Can we please call it Guild A, Guild B, Guild C .. leave guild names out of it
<Taloz-KoWW> We tried that, and while it is good for EA it isnt good for everyone else
<Tikiri> Taloz Im not here to please the Server
<Straylite-EA> Taloz - nice to see that you represent the entire server.
<Taloz-KoWW> I dont see any non EA disagreeing
<ShadeStorm> ok, if ea wants to play that, tonite ill have ss in every plane
<Darious-SS> i only see EA disagreeing
<Drakyn_EA> They all left ;)
<Nahalen-R> my god
<Nahalen-R> you people are impossible
<Straylite-EA> WooHoo!  Let's just threaten everyone.
<Aracnakat> ORDER ...
<ShadeStorm> no stary
<ShadeStorm> you did
<Aracnakat> We have 3 suggestions now ...
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<ShadeStorm> you want it ffa
<Darious-SS> why you guys are good at it Stray
<Drakyn_EA> THERE is your fair and impartial people. Shade saying he'll have SS hold every plane ;)
<Aracnakat> 1) Meeting/Lotter 2) Leave it as is 3) FFA
<Straylite-EA> Every spawn in this game IS FFA....ask any GM or guide.
<Darious-SS> Kat a votes useless
<Drucilla> You calling for a vote?
<Aracnakat> No
<ShadeStorm> thats what ea just proposed
<ShadeStorm> to have an ffa
<Aracnakat> Stating what is proposed .. we still have others who have been waiting to speak
<Tikiri> No that is what Tikiri proposed
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Darious-SS> EA wont agree to anything that intereferes with them
<Aracnakat> ORDER
<Straylite-EA> That's it.
<Drakyn_EA> Its already been stated that EA will abide by a fair and impartial system, Darious
<Aracnakat> Kalorn, did you have a suggestion to offer up which differs from the previous 3?
<Darious-SS> by whos definition?
*** afk_kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Darious-SS> Drak in your opinion is the lottery system fair?
<Straylite-EA> I see what this meeting is....if SS wants to sit there and threaten to monopolize every plane just because we want FFA...so be it.
<Aracnakat> ORDER please .. Kalorn is up (if he has a different possible solution)
<Kalorn-Albion> I hardly see the point at the moment - its becoming like last monday - I wish I could remember what Zoyalla said
<Aracnakat> Straylite .. Tikiri's solution has been offered up as a possibility .. you are not being overlooked
<Straylite-EA> Zoyalla said that it is SAD that we all once worked together to break SolB and LGuk only to screw it all up in the planes.
<Drakyn_EA> She wished us all to think back to the days when everyone worked together to clear the really big mobs
<Darious-SS> Stray and Tikiri is the lottery system a fair and impartial solution in your opinion?
<Tikiri> no
<ShadeStorm> im tired of going to a camp have to negoitate 3 days and then have ea get 5-6
<Darious-SS> why
<Darious-SS> why isnt it impartial or fair Tikiri
<Tikiri> Because I shouldnt have to raffle to play a damn game
<Tikiri> Noone should
<Sintin> in TEB opinion not until we straighten out the piggy backing thing ..which isnt gonan happen ;(
<Darious-SS> but does it allow everyone equal opportunity
<Drakyn_EA> Nobody should be told when and where they can play
<Nahalen-R> Your right, no one should, but thats VERANTS fault, not the members of our server
*** Xandrea|TY has joined #CTC
<Nahalen-R> and until verant fixes the damn problems, we have to work together
<Straylite-EA> No - it is the server MEMBER's fault.
<Straylite-EA> Verant gave us the world....we have made it into what it is.
<Nahalen-R> its the server members fault that the server is overcrowded?
<Aliudyen-DA> Actually Sintin i think were trying ive been stating that yes it is an issue and can we define a workable unit at 18 people or something because to clarify this it needs to be quantified
<Kalorn-Albion> I agree but having a ffa will mean that the guild that can organise the best will rule the planes
<Madarch_KoL> I'm sorry friends I have to go, best of luck
<Aracnakat> Okie .. enough discussion on the FFA topic, it's been entered as a viable solution to the problem 
<Straylite-EA> No...it's out fault that we draw up battle lines and cry like little bitches when someone else gets something nicer and shinier than what we have.
<Tikiri> No its the servers members fault that they cant pull the stick out of thier ass with a tractor long enough to get along
<Sintin> ok ali must have missed that but i like what i see we r moving in the right direction with lotto and this discussion
<Aracnakat> Night Madarch .. thanks for coming
<Aracnakat> We're running very low on time ...
<Xandrea|TY> Shes Back, I have tasted freedom and know that I would rather be here :P jk! :) Hi everyone.
<Xandrea|TY> Bye Madarch
<Duira_AP> callorder please
<Xandrea|TY> were 2 hours over anyways kat :)
*** Madarch_KoL has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Darious-SS> but everyone here but EA is agreeing to at least try the lottery system for the next month
<Aracnakat> Phrost .. did you have another solution not already mentioned?
<Aracnakat> (there are only a few people left on the Que list)
<Drakyn_EA> I've got a bloody solution possibility so queue me ;p
<Darious-SS> why is that?
<Nahalen-R> Straylite-EA: I can agree with that, but I'll be damned if we cant at least try to figgure out some method of making our lives a little less stressfull
<Aracnakat> Phrost / Phrack?
*** Unitsi has quit IRC (Connection reset by peer (TCP/IP connection broken))
<Xandrea|TY> hes afk kat
<Phrost-AFK> back
*** Unitsi has joined #CTC
*** Phrost-AFK is now known as Phrost
<Phrost> Ok
<Aracnakat> Just in time Phrost .. was about to pass you over
<Phrost> I'd just like to say a few things as far as DoI and my own position goes
<Straylite-EA> Nahalan - so to get away from the stressful and structured days we spend at work, we come to a system that you have to sign up a month in advance to play?
<Phrost> and I'd like to invite Straylite and Xandrea to speak during my turn if they chose to
<Darious-SS> or fight every night weee
<Xandrea|TY> Ok! :)
<Duira_AP> heh
<Straylite-EA> I will shut up and let you talk.  =)
<Aracnakat> PHROST HAS THE FLOOR - Please
<Aracnakat> (I would like to wrap this up soon)
<Phrost> hehe, yes
<Xandrea|TY> I have a prize for everyone who waited out this btw
<Xandrea|TY> Ill say at end what it is.
<Xandrea|TY> Go ahead phrost! :)
<Phrost> Anyway I personally would like to thank the calendar, because without it, I probably never would have gotten into the planes
<Phrost> that being said
<Phrost> I don't think any solution we come to today will work in the long run
<Phrost> Because there will ALWAYS be a loophole that someone will be looking to exploit
<Xandrea|TY> and it doesent have to since what we need is a soulution to work until expansion.
<Phrost> no matter how complicated and intricate you make the scheduling system
<Taloz-KoWW> agreed both
<Phrost> I see things eventually becoming either a total FFA Goatf**k nightmare, or (doubtful on this one) with open communication between guilds a good example of sharing
<Phrost> its up to all of us which one it becomes
<Tikiri> Well I can tell you  spending 1 week in any plane is just wrong
<Taloz-KoWW> the blocks are 3-4 days
<Phrost> What I would like to see is each guild feilding a full, self suffecient group
<Aracnakat> (Phrost, please let me know when you are done)
<Tikiri> how many of you actually want to spend mon thru friday in PoH?
<Phrost> that way everyone has a chance
<Phrost> but that wont happen
<Phrost> Greed
<Phrost> I'm done
<Aracnakat> Thank you Phrost :)
<Darious-SS> to help my guildmates i would spend a month in PoH
<Aracnakat> Phrost .. just a question .. was there a solution in there .. or just a comment on what you think? :)
<Xandrea|TY> as long as I had the exp to give I woudl be anywhere for anyone, if I was friends with them.
<Phrost> the solution was to have each guild feild a team
<Nahalen-R> How about this... an honor system of sorts... its basically FFA, but you should on your honor leave after 3 days? its obviously open to abuse and there isnt any way to say its "enforceable" in any sort.. its a question of honor
<Phrost> and everyone random that could use the item
<Tikiri> And I do the same for mine,  but If there are enough people .. Im outta there to do something more fun for me
<Duira_AP> meaning no alliances? just taged chars?
<Phrost> but that would require too much teamwork and good natured understanding
<Phrost> no tags, just each guild having ONE group of 6 in a plane at a time
<Xandrea|TY> what happened to the NFL draft picks?
<Nahalen-R> spend your 3 days in hate, then go elsewhere. dont go back to hate till next month, it doesnt matter if you go with friends or not. 3 days. it could be 4 or 5, does that matter?
<Darious-SS> no offense but i joined my guild to hunt with them and know how they react to a situation and what can be expected
<Phrost> that's my suggestion.
<Aracnakat> I see .. so FFA with each guild having one team (or whoever, not necessarily a guild team)
<Aliudyen-DA> For say... a three day or 4 day stint to try to get people working together more?
<Duira_AP> im not disagreeing Phrost, jsut wanted to understand
<Sintin> i owuld love to see someone say hay i just spent 10 days in pof maybe you guys should invite john doe from guild zz in my place....but this is just a fantasy
<Aracnakat> Same here .. just ironing out your suggestion :)
<Aracnakat> Okie .. next up
<Tikiri> lets just shove all the druids into PoF anyone that wants to help thier "druidmates" get armor show up..   Let all the classes thatr want armor from that plane go in there
<Aracnakat> Curufin .. did you have a solution that hasn't already been stated? :)
<Tikiri> let them stay in there 24 /7
<Tikiri> ditto with the other classes
<Xandrea|TY> Guys im sorry
<Curufin> not solution.  general discussion.  it can wait
<ShadeStorm> farming the plane is lame
<Nahalen-R> Tikiri: heh and watch all the wizzies get slaughtered cause they dont have tanks :)
<Xandrea|TY> but I like other people.
<Aracnakat> Thanks Curufin
-Unitsi- (Private) you write up minutes for this? lol  hate to be in your shoes if so *grins*
<Xandrea|TY> I do
<Tikiri> Wizzies would have SKs and Pallys as tanks
<Xandrea|TY> But I really dont want to consent other people because I only have 1 group there
<Aracnakat> Tikiri .. I'm a cleric and can assure you that I go everywhere my guild/friends need me regarless of loot for me
<Xandrea|TY> I honestly Like the calendar and I liked our NFL draft pick way on how we can choose.
<Phrost> My solution would be free from most of the politics and bullshit which are making this game damn near unplayable
<Aracnakat> Unitsi .. I'll post the log .. no minutes
<Darious-SS> why cant we at least try this for a month and see how it works out
<Xandrea|TY> state your solution phrost
<Tikiri> Kat I assure you the same..  Tikiri is in full PLanes gear and I still go to PoH and PoF  and I have my 1 dragon item  *(had it for months now) And I still go on Raids
<Xandrea|TY> yes please try it a month
<Aracnakat> Next is IDAR .. did you have a solution that's not been stated? :)
<Unitsi> *grins*
<Aliudyen-DA> One thing to remember planes are one of the few "guild" things left to do inthe game.  One can no longer log in and say hey lets go to guk...There are planes and kedge for the most part..for level 50's of coruse
<Xandrea|TY> hell in a month the expansion will be out :)
<Tikiri> and I dont get another til aprox 60 others get one =)
<Idar-DoA> Probably not, but I'll try :)
<Darious-SS> by the end of that month expansion willh opefully solve alot of the issues
<Aracnakat> (I hope so Darious)
<Idar-DoA> I just have some suggestions... which may or may not have been mentioned before.
<Darious-SS> can we at least agree to try it for the month of april?
<Idar-DoA> First, I don't think an open calendar will work.
<Xandrea|TY> I am game for that darious.
<Idar-DoA> There should be some link between the people who run the guilds and the people who can use the calendar
<Xandrea|TY> anything that is at least a glimmer of hope for a better future I am willing to try.
<Duira_AP> expansion will not be a solution. perhaps for the mega guilds but there are still 1800 other players that havent been there yet
<Darious-SS> until Verant fixes the overcrowding it will be an issue
<Taloz-KoWW> to true
<Taloz-KoWW> Duira
<Aliudyen-DA> Im not so sure expansion wont be a solution.  its more of how long it will be a solution as even more people mature in levels and how much Verant presses the load per server
<Idar-DoA> guildmasters and officers should have to be given a name and password to the calendar in game
<Aracnakat> ORDER .. IDAR has the floor please :)
<Darious-SS> lets look at now and figure out what will make our lives easier
*** NewB has joined #CTC
<Duira_AP> right, so please stop saying thinking that we can come up with a fix or solution until the expansion unless we are only interested in what afftecs us
<Duira_AP> (sorry)
<Darious-SS> the current solution on the table allows for future change
<Tikiri> Well in the last few planes runs EA has went to.. more non-EA has gotten loot then the members of the guild iteself..     Those being unguilded or belonging to smaller guilds and just comming for the fun etc..      IF this system stays the way it is And IF EA abides by it...
<Tikiri> someone is going to be telling all those ... Sorry... we get only 1 block   go somewhere else to get your loot etc
<Tikiri> that will add more into even more crowded zones
<Aracnakat> (Idar, were you done?)
<Idar-DoA> I didn't think I was, both others did.
<Aracnakat> Please continue Idar, and just let me know when you are done :)
<Idar-DoA> Okie
<Idar-DoA> I would like to thank EA for helping out my small guild getting up into the planes for the first time.
<Darious-SS> in the proposed solution you can invite whoever you like though so how would it affect that
<Idar-DoA> It was also great of Dru to toss an invite our way as well.. 
<Phrost> Ok, sorry to interrupt guys, but I'm out.  GL to all.  Thanks for hosting this Kat.. Your patience is beyond my comprehension.
<Duira_AP> be well Phrost
<Idar-DoA> *waves*
*** Phrack-DoI has quit IRC (Web Browser moved off chat page)
<Tikiri> in the proposed solution it makes 1 guild get 4 days max a month in said plane   now if that guild has 70 members thats 70 people trying to get goodies in a 4 day period..   NO ROOM for extras/unguilded/friends of members/ nothing...
<Xandrea|TY> see you phrosty!
<Aracnakat> Bye Phrost .. thanks for coming
*** Phrost has left #CTC
<Tikiri> There for creating more of a problem imo
<Darious-SS> no the current solution allows you to be invited back
<ShadeStorm> so the nig guilds deserve more time?
<Taloz-KoWW> right
<ShadeStorm> rtt big
<ShadeStorm> err big
<Darious-SS> hence if your good to guild B they invite you during theyre time
<Tikiri> invited by who?  7 unguilded people that doesnt know a calendar exsists?
<Idar-DoA> I guess I'm done.. for now. :)
<Aracnakat> Thanks Idar
<Sintin> teb aint gonna invite EA with 70 people in it ;)
<Nahalen-R> Loot is infinite people.
<Aracnakat> ORDER ...
<Darious-SS> so basically its all about the loot
<Xandrea|TY> ok well ty has over 100 people, yet I dont find it hard to invite others to our camps.
<Aracnakat> Last .. but not least ... Drakyn .. do you have a possible solution that hasn't been stted?
<Drakyn_EA> I'd like to think so..
<Aracnakat> that's stated
<Tikiri> Im talking 70 lvl 50 players
<Xandrea|TY> Im not greedy, its all about new experiences and fun..
<ShadeStorm> like ea and ss?
<Tikiri> 70 planes ready capable people that want something to do
<Darious-SS> SS has 70 active members yet always invites other guilds
<Drakyn_EA> Some time ago before I joined EA, I was on a dragon raid with EA/CC to vox.. my first one. I seem to recall over hearing Oak say that SS had NAggy next. How did they know that I ask you?
<Aliudyen-DA> When i reaqd your roster 2 weeks ago it was 46...primaries wow yourgrowing fast
<Drakyn_EA> Simple answer. They worked it out through talking
<Darious-SS> heh dont believe the roster
<Taloz-KoWW> If you have 70 level 50s, sky is pretty empty mostly ;o
<Drakyn_EA> Now there is a GM meeting every month, isn't there?
<Tikiri> Ali our complete list will be posted soon =)
<Aliudyen-DA> it appears were heading that way i hope so at least
<Aracnakat> ORDER .. Drakyn has the floor
<Darious-SS> Piro left me off it at one point
<Aracnakat> ORDER .. Drakyn has the floor
<Aracnakat> Drakyn, to answer your question I don't believe there is a GM meeting .. it's more of a .. they get together and chat when necessary sort of thing
*** afk_kanbyen has quit IRC (Signed Off)
*** Kanbyen has joined #CTC
<Drakyn_EA> That being the case. Why can't the officer/GM of each guild work it out at the meeting? Put personal issues aside at the door. Nobody bashes anyone else just a simpl, respectful discussion on days in the planes and dragons
<Taloz-KoWW> That was the original proposal
<Darious-SS> Drak thats what the monthly meeting was for
<Aliudyen-DA> I think thats what was originally proposed
<Darious-SS> 2 reps from each guild come in and work together to plan the coming month
<Nahalen-R> Sorry kat.. but Darious, your idea of having a meeting to organize plane runs and dragons, couldnt this just be interperted as a GM meeting?
<Aracnakat> That's solution/proposal #1
<Taloz-KoWW> Nahalen pointed out that some of you don't talk well together though
<Drakyn_EA> I know. We all got away for it to get behind the looto though.
<Darious-SS> thats why its limited Taloz
<Darious-SS> no name calling insults just discussion on the coming month
<ShadeStorm> no matter what my differences with ea are, i can talk with them
<Taloz-KoWW> I would go for pure discussion
<Taloz-KoWW> or lotto
<Aracnakat> Okie .. so Drakyn, your solution is similar to Taloz's initial proposal without the Raffle/Lotto/Randomizing then?
<Drakyn_EA> There should be NOTHING keeping us from hashing this out without having to force people as to when they can do something. GMs get the guilds opinion before the meeting on best times/dates for them and they take that info to the meeting
<Nahalen-R> GM + 1 rep from each guild interested in going to the planes, have a meeting 10 days in advance of the coming month. 
<Nahalen-R> Hash out a calendar
<Darious-SS> i dont think it has to be the GM
<Nahalen-R> well yea
<Nahalen-R> could be two reps
<Nahalen-R> same idea
<Darious-SS> but the people who come do represent the guild
<Taloz-KoWW> any two reps, or reps of an alliance
<Nahalen-R> details details :)
<Aliudyen-DA> or "alliance" that is formed to do the plane
<Drakyn_EA> As long as it was two reps the guilds decided were best qualified
<Aliudyen-DA> for the smaller guilds and indy's
<Darious-SS> well the reps will be decided by each guild
<Aracnakat> OKIE ..
<Aracnakat> I'm going to close this meeting .. with nothing decided .. but instead propose this .. or better yet, offer this up ...
<Darious-SS> any off the wall or insulting you get removed from the meeting
<Aracnakat> I would like the following people to write up their proposed solutions ...
<Drakyn_EA> Sorry if I'm restating Kat, I wanted to push this to the fore again as we should all be Mature Adults that should be able to work things out without bickering
<Taloz-KoWW> NO Talking about training!!!
<Duira_AP> nothing decided? we had ONE consensus
-Darious-SS- (Private) dont close now were on the right track
<Drucilla> we can't even have a vote?
<Drucilla> I hate the idea that I just spent 5 hours of my life for nothing :-(
<Xandrea|TY> has it been 5 hours?
<Aracnakat> Taloz, Darious,  Kenji, Tikiri, Phrost, Idar, & Drakyn
<Drakyn_EA> Relax Dru. Who said it was for nothing
<Aracnakat> WAIT .. I'm sorry .. one thing was discussed and decided for sure ..
<Drucilla> Well, I worry that if we come again together to vote, we'll have to start all over.
<Duira_AP> WHEW!
<Darious-SS> can everyone agree to try thing for the month of april?
<Darious-SS> err thing = this
<Aracnakat> that no matter what we come up with .. we will allow those who didn't have anything booked in March, may keep their prebooked April slots
<Xandrea|TY> I want to
<Nahalen-R> this = guild concil?
<Aliudyen-DA> i think we did get somewhere.  also sintins concerns need to be expressed for this to work we need everyone in agreement at least to a point and we need to cover these concerns
<Xandrea|TY> we did agree on something else
<Xandrea|TY> make sure we can only book dragons and planes.
<Straylite-EA> EA does not recognize the validity and legality of this calendar and will not abide by it in its current system.
<Aracnakat> Drucilla .. I think we did get somewhere .. we have 6 or so viable solutions .. but I would hate for the few of us here to vote for all ..
<Xandrea|TY> everything else isnt spossed to be on the calendar
<Darious-SS> Kat can we put this to a vote to see if everyone is willing to try this thru April?  and then it can be reevaluated?
<Aliudyen-DA> Yes Xan
<Drucilla> you mean that's IF we decided to go with the lottery?
<Aracnakat> Sure Darious .. what for vote?
<Aracnakat> Straylite, are you saying that EA will abide by nothing? .. Not even your own ideas?
<Duira_AP> That beng said Stray...
<Tikiri> He said in its current system
<Duira_AP> does that mean  it wont recognize any solution?
<Straylite-EA> huh/
<Drucilla> I agree with Darious, those of us who felt the strongest about it and stuck it out -- we should at least TRY this for April, given how much time we put into it
<Darious-SS> would everyone be willing to give the proposed solution on wiping april and leaving march as is and seeing how this works for the next month
<Aracnakat> We are here to rework the current 
<Xandrea|TY> I am willing darious! :)
<Nahalen-R> They idea is, that people who did NOT have time in march, whom have time in april, dont get totally screwed out of their time
<Drucilla> wiping except for those who didn't have March dates
<Drakyn_EA> Umm.. I didn't put my views forth as EA, I put them forth as my own
<Taloz-KoWW> We have one question
<Nahalen-R> everything else is wiped
<Taloz-KoWW> Do we have a meeting and discussion or lotto
<Aracnakat> Are we speaking of proposal 1 Meeting / Lottery?
<Darious-SS> meeting
<Drucilla> we'd need to lock calendar and schedule our guild lotto meeting
<Aracnakat> Or meeting alone with no lottery?
<Taloz-KoWW> That is the only question left
<Darious-SS> then decide witht he guild reps how it should work
<Unitsi> meeting
<Drucilla> meeting with no lottery?
<Nahalen-R> were talking about clearing april as discussed, then doing the meeting for the rest of april
<Taloz-KoWW> I will back either
<Drucilla> oh, you mean to have this discussion all over again? :-)
<Darious-SS> maybe at the end of the the month everyone wont need the lottery
<Darious-SS> no
<Taloz-KoWW> no just discussion over blocks
<Karn-RP> meeting
<Darious-SS> 2 reps from each guild
<Drakyn_EA> No, it wouldn't be this discussion it would be just a discussion of viable dates for guilds iin April
<Drucilla> lottery would be WAY simpler
<Karn-RP> aye 2 rep from each guild
<Xandrea|TY> meeting with lotto, but if we can just have a meeting sure, but lotto would cut out the buro crap.
<Duira_AP> why 2 reps?  more people to bicker
<Taloz-KoWW> Agreed, but some simply wont follow a lotto
<Darious-SS> the reps can work thru the lottery details
<Nahalen-R> Stray: do you agree that having a meeting before each month to hash out time fairly... is fair? would EA agree to that?
<Aracnakat> Lottery is simpler .. but gets away from communications and working together
<Taloz-KoWW> 1 rep per guild?
<Kalorn-Albion> that to include what constitutes 'piggybacking'? let the guild reps decide at the meeting?
<Xandrea|TY> I mean no one can dispute
*** NewB has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Drakyn_EA> Dru your still talking about forcing dates down peoples throats where as the meeting will give each representative the chance to schedule the most convenient dates for the people they represent as a whole
<Darious-SS> 2 reps per guild but 1 vote
<Duira_AP> 1 is my thought. I discussed this with my guild before I came
<Drucilla> Getting us all together in a room and doing one method is a great start to communication -- no need to push it.
<Unitsi> aye 2 reps but 1 vote per guild
<Straylite-EA> I would agree getting together often, GM to GM, and hashing things out as to who gets what.
<Straylite-EA> I AM speaking for EA in this.
<Aracnakat> WAIT ...
<Xandrea|TY> wow!
<Nahalen-R> ok.. we seem to have an concensus here....
<Duira_AP> ANOHER?
<Darious-SS> lets vote
<Aracnakat> Who will run the meetings? (I don't want anything to do with it)
<Drakyn_EA> I'm glad you said that Stray, I didn't want to get lynched when I got back in the game ;ppp
<Taloz-KoWW> awww
<Duira_AP> 10:45 SECOND AGREEMENT?
<ShadeStorm> bgup isnt around much stray....you need to come to me ;>
<Taloz-KoWW> LOL
<Darious-SS> can we all agree to work this coming month in hopes that at the end of next month all reps can come together and book time fairly?
<Drucilla> Maybe each month a different gm moderates.
<Aracnakat> <-- will agree with anything to get out of the meeting
<Kalorn-Albion> I suggest we have a different person each meeting
<Xandrea|TY> hahaa
<Straylite-EA> Listen...it's the way things used to be.  The GMs always used to communicate and decide things...why can't they still?
<Darious-SS> vote yay or nay plz
<Nahalen-R> heh
<Xandrea|TY> I agree to have the people make thier proposals
<Darious-SS> can we all agree to work this coming month in hopes that at the end of next month all reps can come together and book time fairly?
<Xandrea|TY> then come back when proposals are mad
<Xandrea|TY> Kat que me!
<Tikiri> I am in Agreement with Stray
<Xandrea|TY> I wanna talk.
<Duira_AP> u cant bow out Aracn, u started this )
<ShadeStorm> bgup gave me that job, and to tell ya the truth...im much fairer than he is
<Drucilla> because there are a lot more guilds and GMs now.
<Drakyn_EA> Wow.. people got my point ::Sits up and beams::
<Aracnakat> Speak Xan .. no more Ques ;p
<Xandrea|TY> Ok!
-Darious-SS- (Private) please do a yay or nay vote on the meeting to schedule
<Aliudyen-DA> To be bluntly honest as much as i hate to throw names and have refrained from to now.  Oak is very unwilling to compormize on any issue
<Aracnakat> Yay
<Duira_AP> there has to be a better effort to get other guilds here regardless if they are currently ready for the planes!
<Xandrea|TY> I suggest the people with SOLID ideas, make proposals
<Aracnakat> Everyone vote on Darious' proposal .. Yay or Nay
<Aliudyen-DA> If he will comprimize so will I.  most ccertainly but its 2 ways
<Xandrea|TY> Kat looks over them to see which fit what we have discussed.
<Xandrea|TY> yey
<Nahalen-R> Yay.
<Xandrea|TY> Im willing! :)
<Drucilla> oops, can you restate that proposal?
<Darious-SS> yay
<Taloz-KoWW> yay
<Duira_AP> aye
<Straylite-EA> It has to be 2 ways.  The only way to get anything done is give AND take...not consistantly one sided.
<Darious-SS> work this month and have a meeting with the guild reps
<Xandrea|TY> its the football one
<Drucilla> work this month?
<Darious-SS> before april to work out time sharing
<Aracnakat> The proposal is to give the meeting of the guilds per month a chance for April (and after April, it might not even be necessary with expansion)
<Drucilla> you mean just leave March the way it is?
<Darious-SS> leave March as is
<Taloz-KoWW> Meeting on the 21st maybe?
<Aliudyen-DA> Yay but we need to adress issues brought up here still such as the definition of "piggybacking" etc to make all hapy
<Kalorn-Albion> yes
<Drucilla> but then come together to work out April with lottery or however?
<Sintin> yes Ali
<Xandrea|TY> yes druc
<Sintin> no use booking time slots for march till we straighten that out
<Darious-SS> the guild/alliance reps come together a week before April
<Aracnakat> April will be deleted except those guilds who had nothing blocked in March .. fair?
<Drucilla> okay, sorry for my slowless, I vote yay
<Drucilla> and I am not a sausage
<Xandrea|TY> Fair kat
*** Drucilla is now known as Dru
<Taloz-KoWW> Fair
<Nahalen-R> fair.
<Xandrea|TY> Ok dru :)
<Duira_AP> fair
<Aracnakat> EA didn't vote??
*** Dru is now known as Drucilla
<Xandrea|TY> no only non members of ea voted
<Drakyn_EA> Stray already stated he would agree to a wipe of April
<Aracnakat> Okie :)
<Xandrea|TY> *shrug* we need to have consensus for this to work.
<Aracnakat> Sorry .. was looting at the yays
<Xandrea|TY> ok this meeting done can I give the cookie out now?
<Aracnakat> looking
<Straylite-EA> I agree to leaving March as is.  After that, I suggest that the GMs get together the way they used to to get things done.
<Taloz-KoWW> We need a date for the meeting
<Nahalen-R> Thats concensus. :)
<ShadeStorm> i agree with that stary
<ShadeStorm> err stray
<Xandrea|TY> woooo!!!
<Nahalen-R> 10 days before april
<Nahalen-R> whatever day that is
<Xandrea|TY> Starylite hehe 
<Taloz-KoWW> marche 21a
<Taloz-KoWW> marche 21st
<Straylite-EA> BUT listen....
<Drucilla> Kat, is it possible to send email to all the calendar administrators?
<Duira_AP> heh, the but
<Drakyn_EA> Lets make it a weekend day ;p
<Xandrea|TY> yes weekend please.
<Nahalen-R> 25th?
<Aliudyen-DA> I agree Staylite with as many issues resolved as we can,.
<Taloz-KoWW> Mar 19..
<Straylite-EA> It all has to be fair....  Seriously....  No backstabbing bullshit...just GM to GM and be honorable.
<Aracnakat> (not sure Dru) .. but I can post it on the CTC either way
<Xandrea|TY> pick a weekend
<Darious-SS> insults and name calling in the meeting should not be tolerated
<Nahalen-R> 18-19 or 25-16...
<Drakyn_EA> As I said Stray, all personal issues get left at the virtual door to the meeting
<Taloz-KoWW> I do ask that this be GM+1 officer allowed
<Kalorn-Albion> well guild rep to whoever - I know that I will be representing Albion not our GM
<Taloz-KoWW> Cause I do this stuff for KoWW, and am not GM
<ShadeStorm> i always rep ss in these matters
<Darious-SS> id say 2 reps assigned by the guild
<Unitsi> and in a private room if at all possible for lessen interuptions
<Xandrea|TY> Im GM for TY
<Xandrea|TY> my rep will be Rylur Athee or Samanta
<Xandrea|TY> with me hehe :)
<Aliudyen-DA> Id say 2 reps due to varying infrastructurs of the guilds.  for DA it will be GM + 1 rep but for others that might not be the best
<Taloz-KoWW> lol or or or
<Xandrea|TY> depending on who can make it
<Darious-SS> but an understanding that reps attending the meeting do speak for said guild
*** Shai has joined #CTC
<Nahalen-R> Yup..
<Drucilla> we all seem to think 2 is fine.
<Taloz-KoWW> 2 reps for every guild, and those reps speak 100% for thier guild
<Xandrea|TY> yes 100% for thier guilds
<Nahalen-R> so... 18-19th or the 25-26th?
<Xandrea|TY> No im a member for some guild yet I dont speak for them
<Darious-SS> and no shit slinging in the meeting
<ShadeStorm> just so everybody knows....this room can only hold 100 people
<Xandrea|TY> 19th is fine by me actually any day ;)
<Darious-SS> Shade the number is limited
<Xandrea|TY> Kat pick a day hehe
<Aracnakat> Okay .. important question .. who will moderate the first meeting .. and the date?
<Unitsi> password protected?
<Taloz-KoWW> Either is good
<Aracnakat> I don't care ;p
<Darious-SS> 2 per guild should only hit 40 or so
<Aracnakat> <-- won't be there ;p
<Xandrea|TY> ok FLIPPING COIN!
<ShadeStorm> i can password protect the room
<Xandrea|TY> bah kat hehe
<Duira_AP> we had 57 earlier
<Aliudyen-DA> Including "alliances formed to that point. and as other guilds get up in level they join in this "monthly" meeting or whatver its gonna be.
<Unitsi> : smiles
<Darious-SS> yea but it was more than 2 per guild
<Xandrea|TY> grr I have no quarters ;)
<Xandrea|TY> someone else flip
<Aracnakat> Shade .. if you can password protect this .. make the password and put it in the Guild Private Forum on the CTC so all can see it
<Aracnakat> (all GMs and reps that is)
<Darious-SS> guys weve been in here awhile
<ShadeStorm> i will
<Aliudyen-DA> Someone also needs to get this info for the alliances.  if they arent represented on the guild forum
<Duira_AP> gawd, 5 hours
<Aracnakat> Thanks Shade .. I don't know how to manipulate these boards :(
<Taloz-KoWW> IAnyone else think AoW is sleeping tonight?
*** Shai has quit IRC (Leaving)
<Darious-SS> can we worry about the moderator later maybe have the guilds discuss it on the GM boards?
<Kalorn-Albion> tell me about it 4am here in the UK
<Aracnakat> Okie Darious .. I"m good with that
<Xandrea|TY> Ok I flipped a dollor :) everyone ok with 19th?? :)
