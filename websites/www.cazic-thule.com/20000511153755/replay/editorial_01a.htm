<p class=MsoBodyText><b>6.1.1 Q – What are some current thoughts on the AC vs.
Stats debate?<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>A. – </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Courier New"'>The
AC vs. Stats thing.... <br>
<br>
Two schools of thought (or there were): <br>
<br>
1. Maximize your stats, especially strength, agility &amp; dexterity for tanks.
<br>
2. Maximize your AC, ingore stats for the most part. <br>
<br>
Theories that supported #1 <br>
<br>
-Strength increases ATK rating, so your chance to hit and your damage go up
with higher strength. <br>
-Dexterity increases your chance to hit, your chance of parrying and riposting,
your chance of double attacking, your chance to proc. <br>
-Agility increases your AC and increases your chance to dodge, parry &amp;
riposte. <br>
<br>
If these things were true, stats would be worth going after. Almost every one
of these ideas has proven to be wrong based on testing using log parsers AND
according to official word from Verant. <br>
<br>
-Strength increases your damage potential slightly (about 1 point per 10
strength), but you won't hit for maximum damage often at all and mean damage
will not change even a point with very high strength. <br>
-Strength has no effect on your chance to hit anything. <br>
-Dexterity has no effect on your accuracy. <br>
-Dexterity has no effect on the odds of parrying, riposting, double attacking
or dual wielding but does have an effect on how fast you learn those skills. <br>
-Agility has no effect on dodging, etc. but does raise your AC (about 1 AC per
6 agility or so). Also, agility under 75 really hurts and going from 74 to 76
will give a real jump in AC. <br>
-Dex does affect procs, but you need a huge amount of dex to get a reliable
increase in proc rate. <br>
<br>
In other words, your stats do almost nothing for your combat performance. An
ogre warrior will barely outdamage a gnome warrior, despite a HUGE difference
in strength, for example. <br>
<br>
This means that maximizing your stats at the COST of AC is not a good idea. A
few examples where people did (and do, if they haven't accepted the gospel ;-)
this: <br>
<br>
Gold black pearl choker vs. a neck item with AC <br>
Platinum fire emerald rings vs. jagged bands <br>
Executioner's hood vs. skull shaped barbute <br>
<br>
If you can get an item that doesn't cost you much AC AND gives a benefit in
stats, then go for it. For example, the dented brass mask (AC 4, +4 str) gives
1 AC less than a Steel Mask, but provides +4 str. For weaker races especially,
this is a good trade. An ivory etched collar, AC 5, +2 wis, +2 int, +2 str is
less AC than a steel collar (6 AC), but also provides some nice little stat
bonuses. <br>
<br>
The general theories right now: <br>
<br>
1) Get AC as high as you can until you pass 800, at which point adding more AC
won't help a lot (has not been tested, just generally accepted wisdom). <br>
<br>
2) Keep agility over 75. <br>
<br>
3) Ignore dex unless you have a procing weapon (Ghoulbane). Even if you do have
a procing weapon, I would NOT boost dex at the cost of AC, but opinions vary
here. <br>
<br>
4) Keep strength as high as possible while not sacrificing a large amount of AC
and while keeping agility over 75. Some items are great for this - dented brass
mask, ivory etched charm, diamondine earrings, hero bracer, for example. <br>
<br>
5) Don't worry about wisdom until you get greater heal at 39. At that point,
add wisdom where ever you can without sacrificing AC. <br>
<br>
6) Ignore charisma unless you are buying/selling from a merchant and MAYBE when
you are trying to use the Lull/Soothe/Calm line (I've seen NO data on this,
just the word of GZ). <br>
<br>
7) Ignore intelligence unless you need to learn a skill quickly (should
probably boost dex in this case). <br>
<br>
8) Stamina... jury is still out. Adding stamina through items adds very few
hitpoints, even at high levels (I think my greaves of Ro, +6 stamina, added
about 10 HP at 44th level). Still debate over how stamina is related to your
&quot;fatigue&quot; bar and whether higher stamina helps prevent you from
getting stunned. <br>
<br>
I think that summarizes things. ;-) <br>
