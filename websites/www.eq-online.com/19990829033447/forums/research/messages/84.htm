First of all, Enchanters are a Tactical Combat class .. second of all, this proves you have no tact. Simply play those classes that have something strong to them. Enchanters have a spell called Tashan to reduce Magic Resistance, Laguid Pace to lessen the rate of being beat up, Charm to kill something and in turn kill it too (great for experience), Soothe to prevent masses of mobs running after you, Memory Blur to steal kills (heh) or get mobs off of you, Enduring Breath to help actually brave Kedge's Keep (I don't think anyone has gone inside it yet), the ability to Enchant Metals (Some good stuff), Choke for DoT then follow up with Chaotic Feedback, and illusions for play.<p>What is the problem with that?<br>
