<td><font face="helvetica" size=2>Welcome to the Unofficial Everquest F.A.Q.  We put this FAQ together because as a day to day part of our operations here we are asked 
many questions both on our message board and more frequently through email.  So we have compiled a list of the questions we have seen the most and/or the best questions asked of us 
since 12-21-98 when this site was founded.  Below we will provide answers to these questions.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Combat is initiated for the most part by you, the player.  In some 
circumstances the monster attacks you first and then you need to go into "combat" or "Auto attack" mode.  The default key for auto attack is A. 
We suggest switching this to Z, for the simple reason that if you go to say something and did not hit the enter key hard enough you will go into attack mode, 
this can be particularily nasty if you have a guard targeted at the time.  Once you hit the auto attack key, whether A or Z or whatever you tell the game you want it to be
you will attack whatever is currently targeted.  And a small box will flash in the upper right hand corner to let you know you are in auto attack mode.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. You can log out at anytime.  But unless you camp (which you cant do if you are getting beat on by a monster) your character will stay in the 
game for a short amount of time.  The bottom line is if you bit off more than you could chew by attacking something that is alot higher level than you, the best thing to do is try to get someone to help, or run.
Alot of times running can be worse than just standing and facing your fate.  Running turns your back to the monster and increases their chance of "Stunning" you.  In Everquest, if your think you are going to die because you 
have either taken on something to powerful for your level, or have been ambushed by more than a few things, the best thing to do is go out fighting.  You might even take one with you.

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white"><b>Q. I am assuming there is a way to group, or form a party in Everquest, how exactly do you do this?</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Yes, you can group in Everquest.  Groups are currently limited to six people but this gives you plenty of members of the group that can do different things.
Ideally you should have a "tank", who is usually a warrior or some other high hit point class that takes most of the damage while the rest of the party beats on whatever you are fighting, clerics in a group are ALWAYS a good 
idea do to their ability to heal and "buff" the characters in the party, rogues at higher levels can backstab and cause some serious damage to what you fight, so as you can see everyones has a definable role in a party and every class
can be successful in a group atmosphere.  To create a group find other players who are near your level, target them and hit the invite command.  If they accept you will form the group.  Your party window on the right side of the screen will 
be updated to show you the health of your group members, this can be very useful if someone who is not in your current view is under attack, you can also default your chat window to tell specifically to the group.

<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white"><b>Q. How bad is the lag in the game?</b></font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. This is a tough question, there were some times in the beta that I thought I was under some heavy lag, but looked down at the "lag meter" and realized that what I was experiencing was not 
internet lag but what us beta testers called "video lag".  Video lag can be annoying, if you get tons of people on the screen at the same time casting spells, fighting, etc.  Your graphics update will slow down, you wont move very fast, but the rest of the 
game is moving at normal speed, it can be very annoying.  And happens even to those with higher end video cards/machines.  But more rarely.

<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. The best test is to try the game.  But if you are wondering about video card issues, we suggest that you check out the <a href="http://www.station.sony.com/everquest/">Official Everquest Homepage</a> for the 
video cards and hardware they have tested in the game.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Yes, many different views, and you will learn to use the one that best fits the situation.  
An example would be in Kelethin, the wood elf city, there are a lot of places to fall of the platforms in the city and fall to your death.  Some of the ramps in the city 
can be hard to see in first person, it is a good idea to switch the view to something like overhead view to see where exactly that ramp is.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><font face="helvetica" size="2" color="white">A. Well I can't vouch for the PVP server but on the normal servers, no, not unless you are +PVP.  If you are -PVP which means you have not decided to follow the 
ways of chaos, then you are safe from looters, and being PK'd.  NO ONE can loot, kill, or steal from you.  On the other hand you can "consent" someone to loot your corpse, giving them permission to loot your corpse.
You should only have a freind or someone you trust do this though.
