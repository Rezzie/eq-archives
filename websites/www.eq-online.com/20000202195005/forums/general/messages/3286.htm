: Does anyone else find that quests claim to give you experience but no matter how many times you waste your fingers doing it, your damn bar doesn't move?<p>There are some quests that actually do give good xp, unfortunately I only know of one that is great.  In South Karana at the centaur camps you can trade items and jewels (of the right kind) in for crafted armor.  The quest for the crafted gauntlets is an aviak charm and 2 star rubies.  Now the great thing about this quest is that the Aviak Avocets that drop the charms are in SK also.  The Avocets are around lvl 30 or so but a full group of 20+ can kill one.  Do the crafted gauntlet quest and see how much xp you get.  I have a friend that made lvl 37 from 35 in less than a week.  Only problem is the star rubies cost about 70pp each and you would have a problem selling the crafted gaunts for the price of the rubies.  But on the other hand it may be worth losing 20 to 40pp at a time for.... well you see how much xp.
