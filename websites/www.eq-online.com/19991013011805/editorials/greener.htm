I am sure you have all heard this.  And based on some of the feedback I got from the kiting editorial I will address another all to common problem in Everquest.
I received mail from a fan concerned about the future of Everquest he wrote:
<p>
<quote>I have played most of the online games and have seen the grass is always
greener fanatics run them. I cant do that so no one should. I really hope
everquest does not go down that path.</quote>
<p>
I totally agree with this.  Right now you may be in denial of this FACT.  Let me give you a recent example of this exact thing.
Warriors got a critical hit capabilitie a few patches ago.  Now, soon rogues and rangers will get the EXACT same thing, next I imagine the paladins will bitch and they will get something along the same lines.
This is the whole reason I beleive the subject of kiting which GM's have been saying "Is not an exploit" since beta have now turned into an issue.
<p>
I see Everquest turning into a game where all the classes are pretty much the same because no one wants to be without something that the other class has.
Which is sad, all classes have their strengths and weaknesses.  Some more than others, Verant NEEDS to address the classes that have been sorely gimped or disabed by code THEY have written and fix them.
There are classes in the game now that need serious work, other classes are balanced quite well and should be left ALONE.  But then we get the jealous people who think their class should not be without this skill or that item.
Honestly these are probably the same people that in real life are never happy with anything anyway.  
<p>
And they bring that aspect into Everquest.  Another response I received to the kiting editorial was this:
<p>
<quote>This is NOT a solo GAME.
Verant made that clear at the onset of EQ release.
Kiting makes grouping unnecessary.
Necro are still very effective and with range DoT the DoT bug can be
avoided by disengaging or moving out of range.
Again let me STRESS that this is a GROUP orientated GAME.</quote>
<p>
As I said to this guy when I responded to him, I solo'd my necro to 48th, where I needed a group at that time, but at 48th level a necromancer actually has something to contribute!
They can contend!  This is the whole point, do you think this guys group has ever been affected by the DOT bug?  I doubt it.  A group oriented game, yeah when was the last time you walked into a zone and heard
"Group looking for a necromancer!"  I have personally never heard this, group players have 3 main types of players they want a tank (warrior), a healer (cleric), and a caster/evacer (wizard).
Now if the top 3 choices are not available they will take a ranger or another melee class in SUBSTITUTION of the warrior, or a druid in SUBSTITUTION of the cleric.  You can see how this goes.
<p>
So the classes that ARE NOT really wanted in groups kite, its that simple, its a way for them to gain levels.
This guy thinks that EVERYONE should group, and obviously I bet he plays a cleric, warrior, or wizard.  Someone who has never went to a zone and waited for hours just to get into a group.
So he really wouldnt understand that.  But this is where the grass is always greener fanatics come into play.
"Hey, we have to group to get experience but those guys are getting solo experience, thats not fair".  These same guys are the ones that did not want you in their group.
See how this all relates?
<p>
Everquest could be a great game, right now I am having problems playing it as these fanatics wreak havoc on the game constantly /feedbacking on how this needs to be stopped or that needs to be addressed.
They see Everquest as THEIR game, and it needs to be played THEIR way.  I am not going to let ANYONE especially this guy tell me how to play Everquest.
Even if they do take kiting out, I could still solo a necromancer, with relative ease I would add, there are ways to do it, ways this guy has probably never even thought of.
<p>
Think about this the next time you sign on to play everquest.
