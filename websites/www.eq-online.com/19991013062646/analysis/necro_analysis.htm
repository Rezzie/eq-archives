<font face="helvetica" size=3><b>Necromancer Spell Analysis:</b></font>

<hr size=1>

<p>

<font size="2" face="helvetica">

This list is compiled by me and only me, I have just reached 16th level necromancer, yes I may still be farily low level but I can give you info on the spells through the 4th Circle and can also update this as I progress in levels.

The information provided here is correct, unless otherwise stated by a heading that says UNCONFIRMED.  The damage amounts and bonuses for spells I list are what my character does presently, these may be different for you, or they may not.

<p>

<font size="4" face="helvetica"><b>1st Circle</b></font>

<p>

<b>Life Tap *</b><br>
Ok apparently someone had a problem with the way I described this spell, lets try it again, This spell does approximately 4-8 points of damage to a target.
The damage done by THIS spell does NOT add towards the total whole.  Example would be if you were to compete with someone else using this spell for a kill, it would not help you as THIS spell will not
(even if you end up doing more damage) count towards the kill total.  The same goes for the 8th level spell ward undead.  This spell is also NEVER resisted.
<p>

<b>Minor Shielding *</b><br>

This spell is the other one you get upon character creation, this spell does the following:

Adds 10 hot points and 6 AC to your character while under it effects.  UNCONFIRMED:This spell never does more then 10 hit points, 6 AC as a buff, that is the maximum effect.

<p>

<b>Cavorting Bones</b><br>

Your first pet spell, this spell requires bone chips to cast and will someone a very weak skeleton.  To offset this skeletons weaknesses give it a high damage weapon such as a scythe or 2h sword.

Your pet is equivilant to a fighter of the same level as it is.  i.e. 1st level pet is equivilant to a 1st level fighter.

UNCONFIRMED:This spell always summons a first level pet.

<p>

<b>Coldlight</b><br>

Good for races that have no infravision and also good for those that do.  This spell summons an item called a Cold Stone.  This item CANNOT be traded, sold, or dropped.

You equip the cold stone in your second hand, so you must have a hand free to receive its benefits.  This spell is also a good spell to use to practice conjuration, and increase skill in that art.

<p>

<b>Invisibility to Undead</b><br>

This spell allows you or any of your friends/party members to become invisible to undead, if you cast this spell on yourself when you have a pet summmoned the pet will destroy itself.  But it is good for walking through hordes of undead.

This spell works on all forms of undead even higher level undead.

<p>

<b>Siphon Strength</b><br>

I did not use this spell much but when I did cast it I received 6 points of strength from my target, this number may vary depending on your target.  Basically it is another in a long list of "steal from you give to me" spells.

<p>

<b>Locate Corpse</b><br>

This spell is used to locate a specific persons corpse, or if know one is targeted it will locate the nearest corpse.  When you cast the spell it points you in the direction of the nearest/targeted corpse.

If the corpse is behind you this spell will spin you around when completed.  It usually requires constant re-casts until you find the corpse.

<p>

<b>Sense the Dead</b><br>

Much like the above locate corpse spell this spell points you towards the nearest undead, this can be useful if for instance you know there are undead in the zone you are in but you dont exactly know where.

Also once one is targeted with this spell you can 'con' it to see if it something you can handle or not.

<p>

<b>Reclaim Energy</b><br>

This is used often at higher levels to un-summon a weak pet.  As you gain higher levels in necromancy you start to notice a wide range of levels for the pets you summon, sometimes they 'con' green to you, this means the pet is probably 3 levels below you.

You would then employ this spell to un-summon the weak pet so you can summon another one, it also restores a small bit of mana.

<p>

<b>Disease Cloud</b><br>

A fairly useful spell at lower levels this spell will do an instant 5 points of damage and also do continous damage and prevent your target from healing for the duration of the spell.

<p>

<font size="4" face="helvetica"><b>2nd Circle</b></font>

<p>

<b>Gate</b><br>

This spell once cast will instantly teleport you to your home location (the same point you appear if you die).  If you have been bound to some other place then this spell will take you to your bound point.

I have used this spell to escape sticky situations, it has a fairly long casting time though so if you know things are going badly, cast it as soon as you can.  It can save your life.

<p>

<b>Fear</b><br>

This can be a fun spell, but I have not used it very much.  This spell once cast if it is succesful on your intended target will cause it to flee in panic.

Once the effects of this spell wear off the target returns, and could bring freinds with it.  I have used it at times when I have two things attacking me and my pet is already on one of them and the other is beating on me.

In most cases I have been able to fear the mob beating on me and have it run, then I will turn to the mob my pet is fighting and life tap to heal up then be ready for the attacker I feared once he returns.

Although I have died employing this tactic it is kind of a last ditch thing.  Sometimes it works.

<p>

<b>Sense Magic</b><br>

This spell is going to be replaced by Verant in the future, apparently.

<p>

<b>Clinging Darkness</b><br>

I liked using this spell.  This spell blinds your target (although they can still attack, go figure), slows it, and does persistent damage.

It is resisted at times, but it is good to cast on a fleeing opponent as it slows them and makes it easier for your pet to chase down and kill.

<p>

<b>Poison Bolt</b><br>

This spell does approx. 6-8 points of damage and does persistent poison damage to the target, a good spell to start the battle with.

Or a good spell to cast on a fleeing foe, as if they are weak enough this spell will kill them and allow you to concentrate on something else.

<p>

<b>Numb the Dead</b><br>

Use this spell with caution I have seen it resisted way to often.  It is a lull spell for the undead, it can be used to make skeletons and the like ambivolent so they do not attack you, but, 

it seems to be resisted like 50% of the time.  I have seen everything from yellow to blue skeletons resist this spell, then of course, they attack, but when this spell does work it is a good one to use.

UNCONFIRMED:Bone chips required as a component in this spell.

<p>

<b>Life Spike</b><br>

The second spell in the Life tapping series of spells this spell does approx 8-11 points of damage as with life tap it does 8 at 4th and more at later levels.

And is fairly mana efficient.

<p>

<b>Endure Cold</B><br>

Alot of people see no use for this spell, but it does help you resist cold based attacks and can be useful against NPC Shamans, wizards, etc.

<p>

<b>Leering Corpse</b><br>

This is your 4th level pet, it will be summoned as a 4th level pet until you increase in level, then as you do you will start to summon higher level pets.

I have seen a 6th level pet summoned from this spell, but I suppose it is possible to get a 7th level one. If you do manage to summon a higher level one when you are getting closer to 8th do yourself a favor and DO NOT

equip this pet with a weapon, it will attack faster and end up doing more damage without one.

<p>

<b>Grim Aura</b><br>

This increases your attack ability, again alot of necromancers see no need for this spell, well I have noticed that if I do not have this buff up some of my 8th level spells do less damage.

I have tested this over and over.  With grim aura up, 90% of the time I got maximum effectivness out of ward undead, without grim aura up I was hitting things for less damage with the same spell.

This may be just a personal superstition for me, but I have tested it quite a bit :)

<p>

<font size="4" face="helvetica"><b>3rd Circle</b></font>

<p>

<b>Ward Undead</b><br>

Your first real cool spell.  If you play a gnome this is a great spell to go after the skeletons in steamfont with.  At 8th level this spell does approx 38 points of NON MELEE damage.

And sometimes less, I have seen it do 4 before.  This is a necromancers first Evocation spell, so practice, practice, practice.  You can also cast this on your pet with no ill effects to bump up your 

Evocation skill.  At 11th level this spell will do a maximum of approx 41 points of damage.

<p>

<b>Lesser Shielding</b><br>

This is an upgrade to minor shielding.  You get between 12-24 hp's depending on skill and level, 6-10 AC and 6-8 to save vs. magic.

A nice buff spell that seems to get better the higher level you get.

<p>

<b>Bone Walk</b><br>

This is your 8th level pet, he will bash, which can stun an opponent.  At this level you DEFINENTLY want to NOT give your pet a weapon.
As he will hit faster and more often without one, at this level your pet is hindered by having it equip a weapon.  The highest level pet I have seen created from this spell is 10th.
Some people may disagree with me on what level pet you can see from this spell but they probably didnt waste 200 bone chips trying to get the max level pet they could from it =)

<p>

<b>Deadeye</b><br>

An excellent spell for races without infravision or even ones that do have it.  This spell allows those without to see very well in darkness, and as an added perk lets you see invisible mob's or players.

<p>

<b>Mend Bones</b><br>

Your pet naturally regenerates but this spell speeds the process, consider it a light heal for your pet.

<p>

<b>Shadow Step</B><br>

A very useful spell with a reasonably low casting time.  This spell will randomly teleport you somewhere in the same zone you are in.  Useful in making aquick escape from a mob if you dont have time to cast gate.

This spell can be confusing though as you sometimes have to get your bearings after done casting it.

<p>

<b>Dark Empathy</b><br>

This spell drains some of your life and adds it to your target, I have used this many times to heal freinds, and it does a decent job of that.

After all you can always life tap to get your lost hp's back.

<p>

<b>Impart Strength</b><br>

I have found no real use for this spell yet, as necro's are usually not that strong anyways, it seems kind of redundant to give more of what little strength we have to someone else.

<p>

<b>Vampiric Embrace</b><br>

Prior to the earlier patch this spell only increased attack number, now it actually does what it was intended to do.

Again alot of necro's see no reason for this spell.  Here is an example of a situation where I use it.  Your fighting a tough mob, you run out of mana.

Your pet is getting beat down, what do you do?  Well if you have vamp embrace up you can go in and fight, yes the mob will turn to attack you if you wade into the fray but that is ok, everytime you hit while this spell is active you will have a chance to heal.

By casting vamp embrace on the mob.  So there are situations where this spell would be effective.

<p>

<b>Gather Shadows</b><br>

This spell is your own personal invis spell.  It's duration is sometimes very short, and it does not blink before it is ready to give out it just gives out.

But it does come in very handy for traveling through zones where you are KOS.

<p>
<b>Dark Pact</b><br>

This spell lowers your health while it raises mana, previously I had not used it much, but when used in battle you can use your life draining spells to offset the health the spell drains.

<p>

<font size="4" face="helvetica"><b>4th Circle</b></font>

<p>

<b>Convoke Shadows</b><br>
This is your 12th level pet spell, however I noticed that when I bought this one (shortly after getting 12th) that it only conjured a 11th level pet, it seems as though you have to pass the halfway mark in exp for your level to get a same level pet with this spell.
Either that or I just suck at conjuration :)  And after further casting of this spell I noticed a wide range of levels to the pets you conjure with this spell.

<p>

<b>Bind Affinity</b><br>

The travelers spell, once you get this spell you can go see the world, this lets you bind ANYWHERE, however non-spellcasting types that need to be bound still must be bound in a city zone.

But you can bind anywhere.  So when you die you will show up at the last bound point, making it very easy to start seeing the world.

To bind someone you have to have them join a party.

<p>

<b>Spook the Dead</b><br>

This is the same spell clerics get at 1st level.  It seems to be resisted alot, but is better on undead than the above mentioned Fear spell.

<p>

<b>Engulfing Darkness</b><br>

An upgrade to clinging darkness this spell does about the same thing (blind, slow, damage) however it was resisted by things that conned green to me.

<p>

<b>Heat Blood</b><br>
I LOVE this spell.  It is a damage over time spell so you will need to give it a few rounds, but it greatly improves your odds in battle, this spell does approx 16 points/round damage.  For 10 rounds, equaling 160 points of damage, stack this with engulfing darkness 
(as long as they dont resist engulfing darkness) and your fights will be shorter.  My tactic usually employed with this spell is to start combat with it, and then send my pet in to attack, while the mob is busy with my pet and continously taking damage from the heat blood spell 
I stand back and use Life draw on it.  It drops things quick.
<p>
<b>Life Draw</b><br>
At 12th level I am doing 39 points of damage with this spell (and that means healing 39 points as well).  Not to bad on the mana this spell is a great addition to the Life tap series.
<p>Sight Graft</b><br>
This spell lets you see through your pets eyes, it can be fun, but I dont really see a use for it.  Maybe for spying on someone?  I dont know :)
<p>
<b>Waves of Enfeeblment</b><br>
This spell I did not find real useful, you lower things strengths in the area around you, but you dont know how much, and they still seem to hit as hard
<p>
<b>Endure Disease</b><br>
Unsure of the exact amount this adds to your save vs. disease but I will buy it tonight and let Wraith know.
<p>

<font size="4" face="helvetica"><b>5th Circle</b></font>
<p>
I just reached 16th level, ya!  I haven't had my 5th circle spells for long but I can tell you what the ones I have seem to do
<p>
<b>Cure Disease</b><br>
This is kinda obvious, it cures disease, real cheap spell to only costs a little over a gold piece, which is nice consider my other spells are 8 plat or more apeice.
<p>
<b>Spirit Armor</b><br>
You'll have to forgive me on this one, I didnt remember to get an exact number to the AC bonus provided, but that is all it buffs is AC, there are no additional hitpoints or resistance added with this spell.
But this spell unlike many other magic using buff spells can be cast on other people and your pet as well, for a little added AC.
<p>
<b>Shieldskin</b><br>
This spell requires a Cat's eye agate to cast.  I found these in Akanon for around 2 gold.  I didnt get a chance to try this one out but I beleive it absorbs blows up to a certain amount of hit points.
<p>
<b>Heart Flutter</b><br>
Another DoT spell that can be stacked with Heat blood for a nice damaging effect.  I real quickly tried this out on something that was green to me this morning just to see what it did, it killed it rather quickly, but then again the mob I cast it on was fairly weak.
I'll have to do some more research on this one.
<p>
<b>Infectous Cloud</b><br>
At 17th level this did 25 points of damage to the target and diseased them, not sure how much target loses per round yet.
<p>
<b>Voice Graft</b><br>
I did not buy this spell I see no use for it
<P>
<b>Banshee Aura</b><br>
In the process of making this spell
<p>
<b>Shielding</b><br>
As with the above Spirit armor spell I forgot to get the exact amount this spell buffs you for.  I will get it and send Wraith the update.
<p>
<b>Feign Death</b><br>
This spell has saved my butt many times, it has a low casting time and if successful makes you appear dead to attacking mob, also pet fights on, pet is not fooled by this spell.
Makes it useful if monster starts to concentrate attacks on you.  You can use this spell and have your pet fight on.
