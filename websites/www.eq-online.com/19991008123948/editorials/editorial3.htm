But I wrote this to put a plug in for one of the best races I think exist in the game, of course I speak of the dwarves.  I started in Phase 3 as a Dark elf.  I found the Dark elves hard to play, especially when playing a class such as Necromancer or Shadow Knight.  After trying many other races.  I finally found the one I truly like.  When I rolled my first dwarf character I rolled a warrior.  I appeared at the front gates of Kaladim.  With my "newbie" weapon, which was a short sword.  5 loaves of bread and 5 water flasks.  And 2 scrolls, the PVP scroll which I promptly destroyed, and a note from someone to go see a dwarf named Frotob Ogrebane.

<p>

After some extensive searching I finally found Frotob and gave him my note.  He gave me a guild tunic and offered to train me in my skills.  This is an important part of the character process in my opinion.  You start off with 5 points and can spend one point in most any skill.  I spent it all in One-Handed slash.  Since I was a Warrior and the skill I would be using most was that one.  You get 5 additional points to train with every time you level up.  And after a while, I think it was after my One-Handed Slash was 15, Frotob started charging me for training, but it was cheap, 1 copper to start and went up from there.  So after I had my training taken care of, I headed back to the gates of Kaladim and set about killing things.  2nd level came rather quickly.  My targets were mostly snakes, and decaying dwarf bone skeletons.  Anything else would probably have done me in.  I did fight a few bats to I think.

<p>

After I gained level 2 I went back to Kaladim to train again and sell all the things I collected, mostly bone chips from the skeletons and snakes fangs and snake scales.  Which I didnt get a whole lot of cash for, but enough to keep me going.  When you are a low level warrior all you can do is drool over that expensive armor.  So I headed back up and started to hunt again.  I went to the gates and "Conned" things to see what I could attack.  "Conning" means considering, which gives you a colored message.  The things I fought conned black to me, meaning they were an even fight, I did fight one thing that was yellow, which means attacking it is a gamble, and I did almst die.  But I got alot of experience for it.  After hours of this, I finally hit level four.  At level four most of the things right outside the front gate of Kaladim are no longer worth my attention, it became apparent to me that I would either need to find a new place to hunt or spend countless hours trying to level on things that wouldn't help 





my experience at all.

<p>

I headed west, I did a sense direction and it said at least I thought I was heading west, I followed the path.  And after fighting a few goblin grunts, which are a little tougher than goblin whelps I came to the docks.  At the docks I headed up to the farthest one out where there were some other characters assembled.  A dark elf warrior, clad in chain mail, an elven bard, and a fast talking little halfling.  And a very mouthy gnome.  The dark elf chided me and said something about throwing me into the water to see if I could swim.  The gnome laughed, and began to bad mouth dwarves in his tongue.  Little did he know that I had an average understanding of the Gnomish language and could understand what he was saying, I conned him and he conned blue, ahhh I had the upper hand.  I double clicked on him to target him and issued a duel.  He did not respond, or talk very much more for the rest of the time we were together.

<p>

Overall the dwarf I think is one of the best characters around, Kaladim is a great city to start in, not very big, but very nice to look at, and the beasty's outside aren't very hard to kill.  When I sent this to Arkblade here at eq-online, he asked if I would write the guide on playing dwarves, which I am considering, so you might be hearing from me again.

Until our axes part,

Anonymous 17th level Dwarf Warrior
