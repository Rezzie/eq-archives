<p>
First of all I would recommend the book, or print out the info from a good web site.  The Fletching guide has your basic info to get started.
And it is some pretty good information.  After the book or you have this info, next you need a fletching kit.  They vary in price.  Once you have the fletching kit you can start to make arrows.
I would not start making bow until 20+ in Fletching.
<p>
You need four parts for your arrow: the knock, the shaft, the tip and
the groove
The more expensive the different parts, the better your arrow will be.
My experience is that you can combine almost any of them as long as you
have
one component of each category. Results may vary depening on the
components
you used.
<p>
To give a quik rundown for bowyers:<br>
Basically all you need is a staff and a string. If you are playing on
Antonica,
Surefall
Glade will be your place to go and visit. Almost any staffs and strings
can be
found
here.
Put a staff and a string in your fletching kit...that's it. Results will
depend
on the
components you used and if you had any tools available or not (can be
also
bought
in Surefall Glade,but are damned expensive). Even if you use just a
Hickory
Staff
and a Silk String you'll get a Bow almost as good as a LongBow (which
would
cost you 4pp).
<p>

General information:<br>
As with every trade skill in Everquest, special skills will be best
trained at
special
places. For training your fletching skill I really recommend going to
Qeynos and

visit Nesiff's shop (South Qeynos) and visit Surefall Glade (Qeynos
Hills).
If you start as a Woodelf you are also fine on Fawydak
The good thing about the flecthing skill is that you can make arrows and
bows
with the same skill and therefore making arrows will also help you to
make
better
bows.
Also as with every trade skill it appears that you should have a certain
skill
rank
before you try certain tasks. So for the beginning I would recommend
just doing
arrows and arrows all over again. You can pratice your skill for 4
copper (each
of the four parts you need can be bought for 1 copper).
Once you have a fletching skill of 10 or 20 you might want to try arrows
with
ONE better component (e.g. a medium groove instead of a large one).
If you have a fletching skill of 20+ go ahead and try your first bows,
but keep
in
mind that if you fail all your componets - and therefore all your gold,
your
investment-
<p>
So start simple and work your way up just as you would do if you were leveling a character.
Start with the ez stuff and work your way up :)

<p>
Ready to begin your career as a fletcher?  Ok then here is how you will start.  Get a fletching kit.  And go buy the cheapest arrow components.  When you start out you can get your skill from 0 to 16 on the cheap stuff.
Buy the Large groove nock, wooden shaft, field point arrowhead, and round cut fletch.  Make a ton of arrows, do this buy putting one of each component in your fletching kit.
<p>
Now hit the combine button and see what you get.  If all goes well an arrow should be attached to your cursor.  If not, try again.  After you reach skill level 16 these arrows are trivial to you (even though you will still fail sometimes).  So you have to upgrade one of the components, 
and only one.  I went with all the same stuff, but I bought a medium groove nock instead of the large groove nock.  This got me up to 36, and then I used a small nock with the same components.  Later I had to move on to a parabolic fletch rather then a round cut, etc.
<p>
Basically all you have to do is look for the next highest price item.  For example at the beginning of fletching everything costs 1 copper.  Once you get to the point where making arrows with all the 1 copper stuff is out of your league, you would want to look for something that costs just a little more.
Like the medium nock, which is 4 copper, obviously you wouldnt want to buy steel arrow shafts if you know you can barely make cheap arrows, build up your skill and when it becomes trivial for you at a certain stage just look for the next highest priced component.
<p>
<center><b><font size=3 face="helvetica">Making Bows</font></b></center>
<p>
Bows are easier than arrows to make in my opinion.  You use your fletching kit to make a bow.  All you need is the bow shaft and some twine or something to use as the string.
You will want to start out making hickory and elm bows.  To do this buy either a hickory or elm bow shaft and put it in your fletching kit.
Then buy some twine (the cheap stuff) and hit combine.  If all goes well you have a bow that is better than a store bought one.
<p>
There are also tools you can use to help you make better bows.  If you look at the stuff the bow vendors sell you will see that they sell whitling knife, standard bow cam, and planing tool.  These are all tools to help you create bows.
Here is what these extra things do:
<ul>
<li>Standard Bow cam - Used to make a composite bow.</li>
<li>Whitiling Knife - Used to make a Medium bow</li>
<li>Planing tool - Used to make a smooth bow</li>
</ul>
<br>
When you first make a bow you will probably make a rough bow, if you were making a hickory bow lets say, you would make a "rough hickory recurve bow".
With a Whitling knife ( I hope I am spelling that right) it is said that you can make a Medium bow instead of the rough, I have a whitling knife and haven't made a Medium bow yet, but one thing I do know is that you dont put these tools in the fletching kit.
Also my skill in fletching is now 105.  I spent alot of money on an Oak bow shaft and failed at making it.  So I would suggest building skill on arrows after both the hickory and elm bows are to trivial for you.
There is a huge price jump between a the two low end bow shafts and the two high end bow shafts.  Which means your skill probably has to be REALLY good to make one of those bows.
