     						  ----------------------
	
<p>
                            User Adjustable Clipping-plane
<p>
                            We have recently implemented a user adjustable clipping-plane. This will allow players with
                            higher-end hardware to move out the distance at which the 3D world geometry is drawn into view, as
                            well as the ability for players with lower-end hardware to pull this distance in, to further improve
                            frame-rate. To utilize this new feature, you may do so by adjusting the clipping-plane slider bar
                            located in the "Options"-"Display" directory, in-game. Sliding the bar left will reduce the distance at
                            which the geometry is drawn in to view, whereas sliding the bar to the right will expand this distance.
                            The following rules apply as to which zones the adjustable clipping-plane may be used in:
<p>							<ul>
                                 <li>- The clipping-plane can be pushed back in outdoor zones only.</li>
                                <li> - Zones designed with heavy fog (e.g. tox, innothule, etc), the clipping-plane can only be
                                 adjusted slightly. 
                                 Additional chat filters have been added to filter out any unwanted text. </li>
</ul>

                            *Zone Enhancements* 
<p>
                            Kedge Keep has been enhanced with both new items and creatures. Please keep in mind, Kedge
                            Keep was tested thoroughly in-house only, therefore, some additional tuning enhancements may
                            need to be made now that it is available on the live servers. 
<p>
                            *Class Enhancements* 
<p>
                            Warrior - % increase on critical hits
                            Rogue - +8 poison resistance
                            Paladin - +8 disease resistance
                            Ranger - +4 Fire +4 Cold resistance
                            ShadowKnight - +4 Poison +4 Disease resistance
                            Monk - +8 Fire resistance 
                            Shadowknights may now use the following spells: 
<p>
                                 - LifeTap may now be cast at level 9.
                                 - LifeSpike may now be cast at level 15.
                                 - LifeDraw may now be cast at level 30. 
<p>
                            The LifeTap, LifeSpike, and LifeDraw spell scrolls may be purchased from any ShadowKnight spell
                            vendor. To make room for these new spells, the following spells are no longer available for
                            ShadowKnights: 
<p>
                                 - Reclaim Energy
                                 - Mend Bones

                            have been made magic. These are the Mistmoore Battle Drums, the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and
                            Kelin's Practice Lute.
<P>
                            - Bards with magic gloves and magic instruments may now punch creatures that require magic to
                            damage.

Forces of light,
<p>
Some more news has arrived from around - reports of skirmishes continue to pour in.  Assassins, spies, and traitors, have been trying to undermine this great alliance of ours since the start.  In the past few days, assassins appeared in Felwithe and Surefall Glades, among other places.  Apparently, they are trying to take down some of our ranks and cause breaks in our lines of communications and lower morale.  I'm happy to inform you all that although there have been a few casualties among our loyal forces, all skirmishes we have engaged in have turned out victorious for our forces.
Now, some for some additional information I have come to find out.
<p>  
Through some recently acquired documents and information leakage, we know almost for sure that the attack will happen (/ooc) on Hallow's Eve or before that.  
A pickclaw named Nurgal was the one that recovered the ruby and then handed it to Tyrana Slil.  As you may remember, she was killed in last week's skirmish outside the keep.  Unfortunately the ruby still made it into Laarthik's hands, also known as the teacher to Lanys.  Something also of interest is that a note was found on the corpse of Tyrana.  The note hinted at the possibility of greater treasures hidden beneath the keep - this may be the main driving force in the Teir'dals wanting to take this stronghold.
Lastly, unlike earlier reports, there is a possibly that the attack of Highkeep will take place at the same time as attacks on other cities of light.  So, it is important we have garrisons in each city at all times.  
<p>
That is all,<br>
Commander Replay Promisekeeper<br>
Antonican Forces<br>
<p>
/ooc My best guess for this epic battle is Friday or Saturday night.  They are still trying to 'hype' up the event and designate more people into officer positions.  I would think they want as many people to participate as possible.  Also, I've heard different rumors on how this whole PC vs PC thing will happen.  One was that the zone would turn PVP and we would be able to loot one another.  Another was that it would a PVP zone, but we would not be able to loot others.  Time will tell.

<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Event on the Cazic Thule</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Forces of light,
<p>
Carson McCabe made another appearance in Highkeep last night to get more recruits into the army of light for an upcoming Teir'dal invasion.  The latest findings were very disturbing.  Apparently, a pickclaw found a rare ruby of considerable significance a few days ago, and since then, has managed escape and given it to the Teir'dals.  Exactly what powers this ruby holds is not known at this point, and it is imperative that we recover it quickly.
What is for sure though, is that Lanys, the Daughter of Innoruuk, will lead a huge Teir'dal force against Highkeep by the end of the week.  Should they be successful in their attack, their next move will be against Freeport, and with Freeport taken, to fan out and conquer the remaining lands.  These two cities are the center of all trade and travel, and cannot fall.  
<p>
I would not be surprised if the Trolls and Ogres threw their allegiance to the Teir'dals, as they have done many a time.  An Teir'dal spy has also hinted that the Iksar, a strange lizard-like race from the far-off continent Kunark, will be assisting Lanys in her campaign.  Rumors abound that the god of Hate, Innoruuk, may even present himself in this grand battle.  Fear not, my comrades.  I also have word that Tunare's daughter, Paladin Firiona Vie, has pledged her support to us. Mother Tunare herself sent her here.   Lord Tephys had only the utmost praise for her, and I know she will not fail us.
Be wary of traitors, as there are many in our midst even as I write this.  One Highkeep guard was caught secretly jotting down information while Mayor McCabe was speaking, and was quickly slain.  There is no doubt that a price has been placed on my head, being a commander of the Antonican defensive forces, but I fear not, with Marr by my side.
<p>
There are 3 separate units that will be operating during the course of this conflict.  Humans and elves, Erudites and Barbarians, and the Dwarves and Gnomes, will all operate in their respective units but fight together against the forces of evil.  Throw any differences aside, now is not the time to bicker over these petty issues.
Should questions or news arise, feel free to ask the army of light officers that have been put into place for the upcoming campaign(s):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Commanders: Tyrani,</li>
<li>Sergeants: Cybsled, Mercane, Garful</li>
<li>Lieutenants: Horton, Altais, Hillwin</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are many more, and I wish I knew, but alas, my memory is very poor.
<p>
May you stand strong and never falter under any circumstance!

/OOC - Roleplay folks, roleplay!  Also, don't be intent on killing every GM-driven NPC you see in events like this, good or evil.  Converse first.  
<p>
/OOC2 - How 'good' PCs fight 'evil' PCs during this event is unknown.  Also unknown is whether we will be able to loot each other.  My best guess on the later is NO, we will not be able to loot one another.
<p>
/OOC3 - There is a huge shortage in evil role-players for this event, and more are needed.  If you have an evil primary or secondary character, you are highly encourage to participate.
<p>
/OOC4 - Lag is a big factor in any big event, so, be prepared for it, and do not spam the zone complaining about 'Lag' or 'Linkdead'.  We know, we know.

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Event on the Test</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Hail an Everquest Online_newsboard_00!
 <p>
My name is Vyke Satreel, Sirdar of the Circle of Order RPG guild homed on the Test Server shard.  
 <p>
By way of courier, the Council of Order has received news of a recent increase in the preachings of chaos and terror upon the lands of Norrath.  The source of these
preachings seems to be emanating from the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule located deep in the Ogre homelands of the Feerrott.  Councilwoman Cyrn Windsong has made a
preliminary approach to the Temple to investigate the reports formally only to be repelled with violence.  One of our royal guard, Brunk, perished during the unprovoked
attack but not before giving Cyrn a chance to escape.  The Council will not overlook this act of pure chaos.  After hearing Cyrn's assesment of the strength of the
Lizardmen we call upon the populace of Norrath to join with us in purging all life located within the cursed walls of the temple.
 <p>
The Circle of Order will amass and converge upon Cazic Thule on Saturday, October 30 starting at 12:00 PM EST.  The battle will commence promptly at 1:00 PM EST. 
The Council has declared this a recruiting event, so if you are interested in either the Circle of Order or the utter destruction of The Lizardman shrine, please arrive at the
entrance to the Temple by 1:00 PM EST.  Of note, members of the Circle schooled in the rights of Ogham will be on-hand 1 hour previous to the commencement for
magical transportation to the site.
<p>
If you have any questions about either the event or the Circle of Order, please visit us at <a href="http://www.circle-of-order.com/">http://www.circle-of-order.com/</a> or notify Cyrn Windsong or any Circle of Order
member in-game.

<p>
We are offering all EQ players a registration and starter deck in our
collectible card game, Chron X; we figured that we know many EQ players who
play Magic (including John Smedley and Brad McQuaid!) so our players would
appreciate the game.

<p>
Download now and play the first virtual card strategy game on the Internet,
which recently won TWO awards from ZDNET. You'll get the complete game
client and your first deck of virtual cards. Activate the special
Registration code reserved for EverQuest players, and you'll also get a
booster pack of 60 additional cards, access to tournament play with CASH
prizes and the ability to buy, sell and trade your cards online with other
players. That's a $9.95 value --- and it's FREE to our EverQuest subscribers
only. 
<p>
In the futuristic world of Chron X, your landscape is a dark urban battle
zone. Lead your unit into battle as you aim to destroy enemy HQs in cities
worldwide. Like other collectible trading card games, your movements are
determined by the cards you hold. But Chron X cards are digital property, so
instead of a trip to the store, you buy, sell and trade cards securely
online, 24 hours a day! 
<p>
Sign up before December 31, 1999 -

<p>
IMPORTANT REMINDER: once you have a free registration code, you need to
download and install the Chron X game and use this code IN THE GAME. Some
people have gone to the Chron X registration web page by accident and
purchased another registration on their credit card. While we're happy that
people are purchasing cards, we'd rather they spend the money on new decks!
