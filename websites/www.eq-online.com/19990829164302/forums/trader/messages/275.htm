Ok lets see what I can answer here. First you will NEED to use only cat, bear, or wolf pelts. <br>To make just patchwork you cn use a small kit, but you might as well just get a large kit seeing as it does everything.<br>place 1 ruined pelt, and 1 pattern on the box and click combine and , if your good, you will get a piece of patchwork armor.<p>: I just recently invested 23 of my hard-earned practice points into tailoring (I decided to save them up and stuff most of them into one trade skill).  The only thing close to "pelts" I've found in my area, however, are Kobold hides.  Can this be used to make patchwork armor?  Also, when does one need a small sewing kit, versus a large sewing kit?  Are the large kits only for making large-sized armor?  Finally, where is the best place to buy patterns?  There are none in Erudin (although there are sewing kits and books on how to sew medium sizes), and I seem to have bought all the lower-level ones in Qeynos (from the woman in the shop right before the magic-user's guild).  I'd appreciate any advice that you may have.  I basically just want to improve the re-sale value of all these hides that I'm gathering from kobolds.<p>
