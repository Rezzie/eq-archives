Statement of Purpose: <br>We of <name confidential for now> bind ourselves together in friendship and camaraderie for the purpose of<br>adventure and fun. We stake our claim to the principles of honor and valor. We abide by the law set forth in<br>the Writ of <name confidential for now> and honor our leaders with our duty. We purpose ourselves as<br>helpers and keepers of what is good in Norrath. We shun spoilers of fun. We do not propose war with any<br>other. We will defend our members and the honor of <name confidential for now> at all costs. We will uphold<br>the virtues of the Guild's way in all things.<br>This is a small section from the 6 page Writ of our guild. We still need 5 people to make it happen so if<br>interested give me an e mail and we can talk further. The first 10 people who sign up will be reserving for<br>themselves an officers position and a seat on the Council of 10.<br>This is a dwarven guild by nature, HOWEVER we are accepting ALL races except Dark elves, Ogres and<br>Trolls. Even Dwarves allowed Humans and elves to join thier ranks. We hope to hear from you soon.
