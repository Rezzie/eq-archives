spew from the gates of the city.  For the ones not lucky enough to die fromthe cold, the rest are usually eaten by wandering goblins, or polar bears, life in the North is hard, but if
you prevail over the rough environment and the denizens of this frozen waste, you will become one of the more powerful in the land.</font>
