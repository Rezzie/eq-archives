<IMG align=left WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_bristlebane.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun, at the

 expense of nearly all else. Bards, rogues, jesters,

 gamblers and gypsies are all typical followers. They are

 almost always very charming, clever, and witty, traits

 which all Bristlebane followers should strive to have.

 Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are

 performed as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of

 Bristlebane's followers are outright wicked in their desires

 but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they

 are about. And never let one deal you a hand of King's

 Court.
