<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_solusek_ro.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>The Followers of Solusek Ro belive in the raw and

 unbridled power of fire. Fire birthed the world and in fire

 shall it be consumed. True aggressive action is the only

 way for one to obtain what is desired. Power is gained by

 superior force. Followers of Ro have little fear. They are

 bold and brash, and say what they mean, and do what

 they say. Social graces are something they neither

 possess nor desire. They demand the respect of their

 peers and more often than not, earn it as well. Those who

 seek true elemental power follow Solusek Ro, and thus

 many wizards turn to his burning embrace.
