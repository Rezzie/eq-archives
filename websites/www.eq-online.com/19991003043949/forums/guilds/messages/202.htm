I am now into the 2nd draft for the charter, Pledge and Purpose, and Code of the Council.  It is intended to be just what it sounds like; a collective of players who are quite a cut above the masses in courtesy, battle tactics, group leadership, character aid,  and honorable dueling.  If you are interested in reviewing the charter or joining, please email me or post a follow-up.  I can be found on Fennin Ro between 2 am and 6 am EST usually; nearly always between 4am and 6am EST.  Note that players on the west coast can therefore contact me easily around midnight on most days.  If you just want to provide me with your email, you can contact other players at my house most other times of day; seek out Jumin or Aramak.<p>Lomerell on Fennin Ro
