<p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">
The Bard has a wide range of skills, ranging from pick lock to singing.  Here is a list of the skills a Bard gets 
and the level (if applicable) that the Bard can learn them.
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>One handed blunt</b></li>
<br>
This is your skill in one handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as the mace, club, etc.
<p>
<li><b>One handed slash</b></li>
<br>
This is your skill in one handed slashing weapons.  Weapons such as Battle axe, Long Sword, BroadSword, etc.
<p>
<li><b>Two handed blunt</b></li>
<br>
This is your skill in two handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as Great staff, two-handed hammer, etc.
<p>
<li><b>Two handed slash</b></li>
<br>
This is your skill in two handed slash weapons.  Weapons such as two handed sword, two handed scythe, etc.
<p>
<li><b>Bind Wound</b></li>
<br>
This skill stops a comrade from bleeding to death, it requires bandages, but can save a life.  When you drop below
your total hit points, you go unconcious, a party member must act fast to prevent you from bleeding to death.
<p>
<li><b>Defense</b></li>
<br>
This is your natural defense, your skill at avoiding blows this skill combines with Dodge to boost your overall defense against 
attacks.  This skill when improved slightly increases your Armor Class.  Note that this is your "natural" armor class, thus if you 
were to not wear armor, this would not lower the bonus provdided by this skill.
<p>
<li><b>Hand-to-Hand</b></li>
<br>
Hand-to-Hand combat is fighting with no weapon.  Bards will utilize this if they are using an instrument in 
one oe both hands and need to fight.
<p>
<li><b>Offense</b></li>
<br>
Like Defense, this skill raises your "natural" offensivness, meaning it raises your attack number and this bonus would still 
be there if you unequiped whatever weapon you are using.
<p>
<li><b>Piercing</b></li>
<br>
This is your skill in piercing weapons.  Weapons such as Spear, Dagger, etc.
<p>
<li><b>Sense Heading</b></li>
<br>
This skill allows you to sense which direction you are heading.
<p>
<li><b>Singing</b></li>
<br>
This is a Bard only skill, this is your skill in singing, and has to do with how effective Bard songs that 
need singing as their resiquite will be.  If a song is more powerful if sung, this skill will allow it to have more of 
an effect.
<p>
<li><b>Swimming</b></li>
<br>
This is your ability to swim and to hold your breath for longer periods of time.
<p>
<li><b>Throwing</b></li>
<br>
This is your skill in thrown weapons.  Weapons such as Throwing axe, Shuriken, etc.
<p>
<li><b>Fishing</b></li>
<br>
Your skill in fishing determines how many failures you have before actually catching a fish, it also should help 
you avoid breaking your fishing pole.
<p>
<li><b>Baking</b></li>
<br>
Your ability to bake things.
<p>
<li><b>Tailoring</b></li>
<br>
Very useful for a beginning bard, you can take wolf pelts and make patchwork armor out of them.
Patchwork is almost as good as leather, and if you get a blacksmith you can also add studs to your 
patchwork armor making Studded leather.
<p>
<li><b>Smithing</b></li>
<br>
As mentioned above this is your ability to shape steel or other metals into useful objects, like lantern cases, 
studs for leather armor, even metal armor.
<p>

<li><b>Beg</b></li>
<br>
This is a skill all races get, use this with extreme caution NPC's will kill you if you beg from them to much, 
or some if you beg from them at all!  So use this cautiuosly, I have heard reports of NPC's giving away some very cool 
things as a result of begging though.
<p>
