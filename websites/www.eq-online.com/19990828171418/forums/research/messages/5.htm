: : Hi,

: : you may not think this borders on research but it is important I assure you.  I have a few questions about languages:

: : 1. Can you teach a language to someone if you are awful in it?

: : 2. For the more obscure languages (fairie, lizardman, etc) how do you find someone who is excellent in these?

: : 3. If you are practicing with someone else and you are both awful in the same language can you both help each other get to excellent?

: : Thanks for any info!
: : Meth

: Heya Meth.

: Yes you can teach a language to someone if you are awful in it, but I only think you can teach them up to a point where you are at in it. i.e. if you are awful they can learn how to be awful in it from you but not excellent.

: This has been my experience maybe someone else can confirm or deny this.

: Varden
