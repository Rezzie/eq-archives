I am starting up a guild based on the tenants of power and influence. This guild will not be political or religious in nature. This is a guild of<br>would be travlers and adventurers. If you want to dedicate your life to the road and what keeps you ticking is the sight you'll see on the next<br>horizon then drop me a line. I travel currently in the Eurid and Qeynos region but will be making rounds to all cities. I am a level 5 wizard. The<br>laws of the guild would be as such<p>1. All memebers of the Guild must lend aid to a fellow guild member. Helping or hurting those outside the guild is wholly up to you. <p>2. Any race/class/religion may join the guild but, we are not aligned to evil or good. We are just travlers trying to see the world and live to tell<br>of it.<p>3. The guild will be based in Qeynos with chapter houses in all cities to shelter the travling members. <p>4. The ultimate goal of all members is to gain personal power and glory in the name of your guild. By doing so you empower the guild.<p>5. Any attack on a member will be met with swift retaliation so to show that we to not take fools lightly.<p>6. The name of the Guild shall be Band of the Sore Feet.<p>As you can tell #6 is a joke. If anybody is interested in starting up a guild with such principles please email me or just reply to this post. The<br>name and all principles are up for discussion but I would like to stay close to what I sketched here, except for the name that is.
