Hello, and i am cordially inviting all of you to join one of the best Up-And-Coming guilds. The Web Page is not fully up all the way, but it will be. Also, this guild will not be like the others. We WILL be one of the most Respected and Honored Guilds. We don't just stay in one spot and PK, we journey, far and wide, searching the vast catacombs and corners of the servers, looking for the Platinum, Scrolls, and Magickal (Yes thats spelled right) weapons any race has ever seen. We accept all races and classes, as long as you are a dedicated roleplayer, and willing to co-operate with others, we shall OWN Everquest.
