Tailoring:
This is probably the most common and easisest skill to learn. No matter what
character class or  race you are, I would recommend building at least this
trade skill, if you don't concentrate on others.
All you need is at least a Small Sewing Kit (can be bought at almost any city),
some patterns (which you should be able to get at the local leather shop) and
ruined pelts (please refer to trade skill section).
<p>
You can train this skill no matter where you start as it appears that there are
everywhere some animals you can use to rip off their pelts.
This skill will allow you to make patchwork armor, which is good as it costs
you only very little money, offers good basic protection and you will soon find
people who are exactly looking for this type of armor.
<p>
Tailoring is actually the first trade skill I managed to make money with when
my tailoring skill hit just 15 or 20 and most sew attempts succeeded.
Before sewing something different, I would recommend to pratice with patckwork
armor till your skill level has become 26. By that time it has become trivial
for
you, and you might want to try doing studded armor and such.
<p>

<p>
Studded leather requires studs (made by a blacksmith) and a medium quality pelt.
Studs are required.  To create this type of armor you need a medium or large sewing kit.
Since studs are NON-STACKABLE items, you need a medium or large sewing kit to accomodate all the components needed.
To create the armor all you need to do is put in the appropriate medium quality pelt for the size of the armor you need.
Bear for large races, Cats for medium races, wolves for small races.  Add the studs and the appropriate pattern, if succesful the 
appropriate studded leather piece will be produced.
<p>
The number of studs used is based on the type of armor being created:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Masks = 1 stud</li>
<li>Gorgets, belts, and bracers = 2 studs</li>
<li>Caps, Shoulderpads and sleeves = 3 studs</li>
<li>Cloak, gloves, boots, leggings = 4 studs</li>
<li>Tunics = 5 studs</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have found wristband patterns, but have not found all the patterns available yet, I suspect (as with the wristband pattern) they are rewards for quests.

<p>
The best armor a tailor can make, this armor requires steel-boning (made by a smith).  And you also need to use high quality pelts.
<p>
The number of steel boning used is based on the type of armor being created:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Masks, Gorgets, bracers = 1 steel boning</li>
<li>Caps, shoulderpads, Cloaks, sleeves, gloves = 2 studs</li>
<li>Boots, pants = 3 studs</li>
<li>Tunics = 4 studs</li>
</ul>
