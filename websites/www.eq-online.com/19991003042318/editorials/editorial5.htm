         <p>

Greetings, my name is Tanith.  I play a Wood elven bard in Phase IV of Everquest.  I wrote this to voice a few concerns I have about 

adventuring parties.  When I first started my Bard I had a hard time staying alive, the Orc Pawn's that inhabit the woods of the 

Greater Feydark did me in on a regular basis.  After a few hours of dying repeatedly I reached level 2, level 3 came shortly after.

When I reached level 4 I found out why Everquest allows adventuring parties.  When I reached level 4 everything either conned red or 

blue to me.  Which means the creatures that conned red would kill me without a doubt.  And the ones that conned blue I could easily 

kill but hardly get any experience.  There were some creatures around that I found were black to me, which means they are an even fight, and I have a 50-50 chance of killing them.

One such place I found monsters that conned black was the bandit camp near Kelethin.  Deciding not to face the 3 female bandits alone (to do so would surely mean suicide!) I decided to try and form a party.

A dwarf named Toraak joined he was a level 4 cleric, and 2 High elves and another would elf joined.  I had a bard song called "Chant of Battle" running and its effect was felt throughout the party.

<p>

We stood outside the camp, adreneline rushing as we anticipated the attack.  The high elven mage sent his elemental pet into the fray first.  And then the battle was joined.  We all rushed in assualting the first bandit.  Spells flew wildly and the sounds of battle filled the air.

We were victorious.  Killing 3 female bandits.  We sat around and waited for them to re-spawn.  And then attacked again, there was only one problem with partying with people.  Greed.  We probably killed 9 bandits, in which I gained some experience but then there was another problem.

A few left the group, not wanting to share the group experience because rumor has it that it is less than if you killed it alone, but this is the whole point of grouping, none of us could face the 3 bandits alone.  But together we were victorious.  After a few left the group I realized that I was

helping them gain experience, if I could not do the most damage to the bandit then I would get no experience out of it, it also upset me that I didn't get to loot one corpse.  I even managed to strike the killing blow on one and never got the loot for it.  This seems to be a problem to me, a party should stick

together and help each other out, not powerhouse and try to be the one that loots everything and is just there to "leech" off the other members.  I didn't say anything in the game about it, but I left the group shortly after.  I am always glad to help other people, but I think it should be fair and that everyone in the group

should benefit from the groups actvity's.  For now I am soured on groups, I will be adventuring by myself, or only with people I know very well or trust.  I am disappointed in the behavior of a few in the game, and will be more careful about who I group with in the future.  So just a word of warning if someone asks you if you want to join there group.

You might wanna try it and then leave if the same thing happens to you, there are alot of great people in Everquest, and there are some very inconsiderate ones too.
