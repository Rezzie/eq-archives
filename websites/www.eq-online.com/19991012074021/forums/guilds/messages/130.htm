We, the ELITE, have about 80 members on various servers.  Take a look at our charter and follow the link.  If you are interested, fill out an application (be SURE to mention what server you are on).  Happy hunting.  Let me know if you have any questions.<p>Hail all! I stand before you now to tell you a tale of warriors and warlords, magicians and mages, power of mind, power of body, power of faith, power of sword. All these play a part in this tale...but first, let me explain how I came about this tale. For years I have travelled the lands of this world teaching people the word of god, my god to be exact for I am a healer, a cleric if you would. One day I came upon a wretched town, barely a spark of life in it. I had been about for sometime without rest and decided reluctantly to stay at the local inn. The inn was nothing of grand stature as those you know today but yet held a comforting meagerness to it. It was here that the tale began. Alone in the corner of the inn sat a quiet gentleman, his eyes were mere slits in the shadows yet they seemed aware of everything that was happening around him. I asked if I might join him to which he simply poured another glass and waved to the seat. He was a young man, or so I thought, I found later that this was not to be so. His name was Shadokin, last student of the great warlords of old. He was very interested about my stories of travel, asking me many questions of how the people were, were they happy, sad, angry...any emotion was not overlooked in his eyes. Finally I asked him why he wanted to know all this and got my answer to which I tell you all now. "Imagine it!" he said "A world with an elite group of fighters, mages, healers..bards all kinds, fighting for one purpose, one reason." "What is the reason?" I asked, "To protect, serve and yes to rule if need be. A world where parties of these men roamed the countryside, hunting bandits, creatures of darkness, evil in any form that it was given. Alliances with other parties, armies..even kingdoms!" I was unaware of how late it had become and was surprised to see so many people there..all listening to the words this man spoke. All with a flicker of life in their eyes, a sense of hope filled them all. "I am going to make that happen" he said and then rose to his feet, walked over to the door, reached into his midnight cloak and pulled out a parchment. Taking a dagger of unique quality from his legging he slammed it into the door, pinning the parchment to the door for all to read. <br>"Hail people of this town! I am Shadokin and I am here to offer the services of the ELITE to you. <br>I will grant anyone the wish to apply to this guild, if they are worthy and fit then so shall it be that they will join and forever be known as an ELITE. Sign below if you are brave enough and have the courage to fill your dreams and the dreams of others!" <br>Now that was some time ago mind you, but to this day the Elite are known as honorable and just men and women, their word is better than platinum and their oaths are stronger than any bond ever made. They number in the hundreds..thousands maybe..noone knows for sure. It is rumored that they have a place in every city in every kingdom around the world. So if you see someone who wears the mark of the Elite, be respectfull for they have the highest respect for you. I'll be on my way now, (walks to the door and opens it, reaches into his cloak and pulls out a parchment, taking a dagger from his legging he slams it into the door for all to read) Yes lad? what does the symbol of the Elite look like? why it looks like this (pulls sleeve back to show arm) I joined that very night as did everyone in the inn, now we travel the lands and recruit those who would have the heart to join. Good eve all I am tired and must rest...safe journies. <br>There pinned to the door by a unique looking dagger was the parchment, it read.... <br>"Hail people of this town!
