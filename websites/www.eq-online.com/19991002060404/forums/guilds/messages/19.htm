The Syndicate is a more than three year old Online Gaming guild located<br>at http://www.erols.com/seanst/synd/iiiguild.html (click on the logo to<br>load the pages after the movie plays).  We are more than 400 members<br>strong and very organized, unified and professional.  Having been an<br>integral part in the beta testing of most of the online games currently<br>released or in development, we are now shifting a branch of our guild to<br>Everquest.  With several hundred members planning on playing, we aim to<br>be the largest and most successful guild in EQ as we have in all other<br>games we have been involved in.<p>Syndicate members have been preparing for EQ since the very beginning of<br>the beta.  Some of our members were among the very first beta testers<br>into the world.  Since that time we have built momentum in our<br>membership and are ready to EXPLODE into the game next week when its<br>released.<p>We will exist, together as one team, on Tarew Marr server.  We have<br>squads dedicated to each of the races offering opportunities for all<br>members.
