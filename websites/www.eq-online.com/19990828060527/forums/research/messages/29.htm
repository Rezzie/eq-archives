: I have emailed Verant about wizards and research of spells over 24, only to get a response saying that i must be combining the wrong runes.  Well I'm NOT, I have decoded all the books, and I am sure I am using the right ones, but get the message "those items in that quantity did not combine to produce anything".  I have spoken with several GMs about this, and none seem to know the answer.  Today I ran into another GM, and asked him the question about research of level 29 and up spells.  He said that not all spell research has been implemented yet.  How nice.  There are currently only a handful of wizards on the server I play that this will affect, so I am sure its not on the list of 'Things to fix' in the near future.  I have 6 backpacks full of runes in the bank already, and research is not working.  I ask that all wizards out there, and anyone else that wants to help light the fire under Verant's butt, send them an email to ask them to get spell research working, or make our spells avialable to buy as they have done with magicians.  You too will one day be the level where your spells will have to be researched, and I'm sure you would like to see this working by then.<p>Plainly put Verant FUCKED UP!  In beta it was so cool, you could find spells on all the vendors, or certain recluse vendors, for every spell there was a mother fuckin vendor.<p>Then they had to implement this BS called research and TAKE OUT spells that were already int he  game and now research doesnt even work, bah, I didnt reach level 20 before they pulled Sepcialize out either, DAMN THEM!<p>Sorry I am a little pissed...<p>Nixx
