I totally agree.  I use to hate my enchanter at low levels.  It was hard to play, she couldn't hit hard and with low health I was constantly dying.  I finally figured out how to play her around level 18th.  We don't tank.  We stand back from the group and debuff, spin, cancel magic, tashan and assist a group.  Can we play alone? Sure, the pet makes a great tank provided you are willing to take the first hit for it to engage.  But that is what the rune series of spells is for.  Take the first swing, no damage, back up and spin and nuke the critter.  <p>There is nothing wrong with an enchanter.  Low levels are tough, if you are use to playing a hard power hitting mage.  Our damage spells will never equal a wizard's power hit, but we can make to where a group takes very little damage and the parties spells are resisted less. <p>Is it worth the time?  At level 25, I am starting to see it pay off finally.  <p>And it's funny, last night I didn't really feel like playing but my husband was online trying to get a party up for Najena.  The guys were all asking if I was coming in, and if I didn't did they think they could still beat the mobs in there.  Something to think about.....no healers in a group for Najena and they didn't care about healing, they cared about an enchanter in the group because they know exactly what we can do.
