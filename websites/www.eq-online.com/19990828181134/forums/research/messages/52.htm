: Sup fellow necros!  Any of you guys having trouble finding words for research?  At level 23, I managed to find about 20 words and none of them go together at all.  In fact some don't seem to show up as ingredients for our spells.  Where and what have you guys been hunting to get the right words?  Scarabs and griffawns used to give them to me, but they don't give good exp anymore.  I hunt in East Karana and nothing seems to give words there.  By the way, I have a few words, or torn pages, that say "Part of Tsarin's Grimoire Page #."  I have pages 23, 28  and 26.  Anyone know what this is about?  Finally I want to get this sraight, so we don't need a parchment and quill for research then right?  Hopefully someone out there can help, cause as an Erud necro getting spells are a real pain.<p>Bahhahaha there was first mistake, being Erudite, hehehe, but I school you on what to do anyways.  Words dropped by anything that is over 16th level, but some things dont drop even if over 16th level, so you got me.<p>I found alot in Unrest, lots of undead up there and words seem plentiful at least last time I was there, you should be able to find the ones you want or buy em there if ya have too.<p>Tarsan's grimoire (or however it is spelled) is Enchanter item, sell to some enchanter they are stupid and will buy for alot of money =)<p>NO FUCKING QUILL AND PARCHMENT AT ALL!<p>Words you found that you cannot use and are not on list I posted below sell to mage cuz far as I know mages only other ones that use words!<p>Nixx<br>

: I found alot in Unrest, lots of undead up there and words seem plentiful at least last time I was there, you should be able to find the ones you want or buy em there if ya have too.

: Tarsan's grimoire (or however it is spelled) is Enchanter item, sell to some enchanter they are stupid and will buy for alot of money =)

: NO FUCKING QUILL AND PARCHMENT AT ALL!

: Words you found that you cannot use and are not on list I posted below sell to mage cuz far as I know mages only other ones that use words!
