Just as all mortals must live, so shall they die.  To this end, the Shrouded Order, located on the Tunare Server of Everquest, glorifies the occourance known as Death, and pursues it to the uttermost end.    Its followers are fanatical, its leaders ruthless, and its power unquenchable.  The reaping of souls is the task asked of all followers, to strengthen the Army of the Damned in the Underworld.  The members of the Order itself devote every ounce of energy possible to strengthen the pull of Death, and will do anything to further their goals. The Order is an exlcusive Household, with stringent entrance requirements and small numters.  Our goal is to not to swell to a bloated size, and sit on our backsides - we are a guild of action, and will only accept those members that can readily pursue our cause.<br>  As a forming guild in the lands, we seek the help of other like-minded individuals who are willing to heed our call.  If you are interested in more information, visit our homepage at http://members.tripod.com/shroudedguild, or email Astynax, the founder of the Order, at AstynaxUS@aol.com.<p>  Reap Well!<br>  Astynax<br>  Tier'Dal, Tunare Server<p> ***PS: This guild is on the Tunare server ONLY at this time.***
