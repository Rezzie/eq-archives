<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_quellious.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Quellious seek peace. They are not strict

 pacifists though and will fight to defend themselves and

 those they care about. The peace they seek is an inner

 one. They wish to know all there is to know about

 themselves and the world around them. They thirst for

 knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others

 attain enlightenment. It is through the sharing of this

 knowledge that they believe universal peace can be

 obtained. If every creature fully understood itself and its

 neighbors there would be no need for conflict and war.

 Followers of Quellious often follow a nomadic lifestyle,

 constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to

 find themselves along the way.
