I am an aspiring enchanter and was wondering what the spells mesmerize,charm and alliance do, i have heard that charm is like summoning a pet, but it is just using an enemy to be your pet, but if that is true, does that mean that an enchanter could have two pets??? One from their animations and one from the charm??<p>Dunno, just asking, i know that no one likes enchanters any way, but when the new race war server comes out i am gonna make a dark elf enchanter and rule all the lands(LOL) well thanks in advance for anyone who helps me out with this
