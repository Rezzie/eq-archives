<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Tip from an Enchanter on Povar</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">There is a brownie merchant in Lesser feydark that no one has been able to approach, apparently a nameless Enchanter on Povar was able to buy from this 
Merchant in Skeletal form.  He says the merchant sells Bronze weapons, Rawhide, and light heal potions.  Thanks for the tip!

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>A dark elf Paladin?</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Astynax is obviously in Dark elf form in this screenshot, many of you have written mail asking how a dark elf could be a paladin, the answer is simple, the deceiver mask allows anyone to take the form of a dark elf.
Just to clear up the confusion.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Items pages</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Are almost done, Nixx and I have been working hard on them and we are proud to say they are almost done.  Do to the amount of info in these pages we will probably need a few more days to get them up.
We still dont have all the shots we need either, but plam to put up a complete items list, minus some screenshots.  If you are interested in sending us info on an item, include a screenshot of the item, the mob that drops it/where it can be found.
And mail it to me.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Printing out EQO pages</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Yes it is possible even with the black background.  Go to File/Page setup and make sure the dot or checkmark is in "Black Text".  Should print out fine, we will get these directions up soon.

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>1st Soulfire on CT</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">This was sent to me by a good friend I have on CT.  Astynax a member of the Storm tower knights, and a 50th level paladin completed the quest for the Soulfire sword today.
With the help of many Sir Lucan D'lere fell to the guilds hands and the Soulfire sword is now the property of Astynax, congratulations Storm tower knights!  We liked this shot so much we put it up as our shot of the day!
You can also see a shot of the battle with Lucan <a href="http://www.eq-online.com/soulfire.htm">here</a>.

<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Latest patch message</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica"><p>
This server side patch contains the following:
<p>
1. Rangers now get Critical Hits with Bows.<br>
2. Rogues now get Critical Hits with Thrown Weapons.<br>
3. Parry and Dodge Skill Caps for Rangers have been raised.<br>
4. The DoT bug realted to not getting experience or a corpse has been fixed.<br>
5. New PvP rules:  You can no longer loot any weapons that the victim had equipped in his primary, secondary, or ranged weapon slots.
<p>
Please note: This patch DOES NOT contain any changes to Necromancer's Pets, OR the Kiting/DoT changes. 
<p>
They fixed the DOT bug?  Lets check it out and see, necro's, druids and Shamans let me know.
<p>
Also it appears I was misinformed about the critical hits, there's the real skinny I guess, hey I'll admit when I am wrong, since it doesn't happen that often ;p

<font size=2 face="helvetica">Ok, I made some personal comments about someone I disagreed with in an editorial.  I have since re-worded this, sometimes I forget that my editorials are not message board messages.
I am probably going to do one soon on the effects of Twinking.
