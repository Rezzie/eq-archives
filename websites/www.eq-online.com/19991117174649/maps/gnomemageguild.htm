<b>Each area caters to a specific class, if you are a magician, you want to get your training from one of the Magician GM's.  Also, this is where you take your guild note if you are a magic using class.  Strangely enough you might have to check different clockwork merchants who also are in the building, for instance, one of the merchants in the Wizard guild area sell magician spells.  So if you can't find what you need in your guilds area, check the rest.  One final note, the Necromancers guild is behind a secret wall which is not on the map, just walk through it, and you'll be there.</b>
