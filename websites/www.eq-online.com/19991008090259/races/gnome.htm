Gnomes are another one of the races of Norrath that spend most of their lives underground.  The Gnomes resemble dwarves in their appearance, but are not nearly as strong.  They tend to be more agile and quick.
While dwarves are given to the task of hauling minerals out of the ground the Gnomes concentrate on refining those minerals to build something useful.  The home citie of the Gnomes, Ak'anon, is a prime example of the Gnomes 
ability to make many useful things.  From the clockwork servants, to the telescopes spread across the Steamfont mountains, one can see that the highly intelligent gnomes always look for new things to learn.
This makes them one of the better spellcasting races on Norrath.  High intelligence leads to curiosity, and the gnomes do not fall short there.  There race has an innate ability at putting small objects together.
If you ask a gnome about it, they will tell you they are, "Just Tinkering...".
<p>
As with other underground races Gnomes have developed Infravision which allows them to move more freely in places a human would need light.
Being the smallest race on Norrath gnomes are often harder to hit by the bigger beasts of the land.

Not as strong as their dwarven cousins, gnomes tend to be more agile and quick.  And have a very high intelligence.

If you play a Gnome your home city will be Ak'anon, the Industrial hotspot of the Gnomes.</center>
