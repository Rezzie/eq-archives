I am the Norseman, Janadorm.  I am a warrior which knows no fear and will do battle with anything the gods put at the end of my sword.  Oftentimes you will see me making my skin smooth with the blood of my kills as it is what gives my white skin its luster in battle and oftentimes amazes my kills so that they think me a diety.  Lately tho I have been having trouble with those nasty little orcs in Lesser Faydark and finding mages up to the task of speed slaying to be hard to get into contact with.  I would much like and consider any serious offers of guilding on Xegony.  Be warned however, I must fight and kill every day otherwise i get a rash that takes a while to cure.  Also, I know i am a tank but this tank isn't as stupid as some seem to think i am, i know suicide when i see it and i protect any and all mages with my life as it is up to them to deal the killing blow when i cannot.  If any guild is interested in guilding a Halas born Warrior then pls contact me with guild info at plutoed@home.com<br><bows>
