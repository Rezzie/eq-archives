<b>NOTE: The Temple of Solusek is being tested on the Test server, this zone is NOT AVAILABLE on the live servers.  Salarea was nice enough to send me these shots from the test server so you didnt have to go there yourself to see it =)

<center><font face="helvetica" size=2>Hey all.  Recently I went to the test server because my normal server was to full, I decided to check out a new zone called the Temple of solusek.
Here is a <a href="http://www.eq-online.com/shots/temple1.jpg">Screenshot</a> of us making our way to the temple.  The temple is not that big and filled with quite a few different races.
Everyone was indifferent to the Dark elf necro I took there so everyone should be ok here.
<p>
There are many quests to get here, all of them requiring some one of a decent level to do, these are not newbie quests.  I heard mention from the NPC's of Earthen Boots, Clay bracelets, Necro only Shadow silk armor, and many other Mage specific items.
There are also about 9 cleric quests involving getting ingots or icons from fallen clerics all over Norrath and returning them to the NPC for a reward.
This should be an excellent place to find items, and no camping! =)
<p>
The entrance to the temple is in Lavastorm directly across from the entrance to Solusek A.  And not hard to get to (alot of level 1's there).  I figured I would share this experience with all of you by submiting it to my favorite EQ site out there, Eqonline.
<p>
Here are some shots of the temple:

<p>
We will get the specific quest info and have it ready for when this zone hits the live servers! =)
