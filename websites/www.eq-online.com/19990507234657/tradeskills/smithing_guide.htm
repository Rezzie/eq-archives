Before you get into smithing let me tell you what your in for.  First of all you can expect to spend hundreds if not thousands of plat to reach your goal.
I have a freind that has spent somewhere around 1500 plat to get a 92 in smithing, and know people who have spent more.  Now I know what you are probably thinking "hey, screw that I will just put all my extra practice points in it until I can make armor.", right?  Wrong.
You can only practice this skill up to 21 or 20, not sure the exact number this stops at but it is somewhere around 20.  Then it tells you that you need to learn <i>advanced smithing</i> in the field.  
<p>
I wrote this guide to help save you some frustration because smithing can be a very hard and frustrating skill to improve.  First of all you will need TONS of plat.  But for now you can get started relativly cheap.  When I first started smithing I asked another smith what to start out by making.
He said metal bits, this is not necesarily so.  You can raise your smithing skill to 20 or 21 by using sharpening stones, for this all you need is a rusty weapon and a sharpening stone. I play a wood elf ranger so this was easy for me to acquire.
The sharpening stones and ore (for later use) are sold at the windmills in Akanon.  Sharpening stones cost around 4 copper.  And then after that you just need the rusty weapons to sharpen.
<p>
I bought all the rusty daggers in Ak'anon (about 70 of them) and got my skill up to 21 (after about 4 hours).  From there I started making metal bits, at a 21 skill metal bits are trivial but you still fail.
But you need metal bits to improve farther into the smithing skill.  After you have a 21 in smithing start making scaler molds.  What you get if you succeed in making these is a large container lid mold that you can sell back to merchants for 
a little over a gold piece.  And after that you just progressively make harder things looking for whatever costs just a little more to make as your skill increases.
<p>
There are a few things in the smithing guide that are wrong though, the tool box it does not seem you can make.  It says in the smithing guide that all you need is metal bits and water, but if you try to combine this you get a message saying this doesnt combine to make anything.
Also to make metal bits you need to put 2 ore in seperatley, and one flask of water.
