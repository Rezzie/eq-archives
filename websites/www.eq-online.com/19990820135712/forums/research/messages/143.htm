Go to http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag_dis.shtml for a full discussion of the pets by one of the game designers.  :-)<p>P.S.  So far, the water elemental has been most satisfactory for me.  I haven't tried fire, but I got an air elemental killed and an earth elemental killed.  My water never was killed.
