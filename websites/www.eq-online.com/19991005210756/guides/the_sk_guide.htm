<p>
So you wish to be a Knight of Shadows, A champion of darkness, we who rage against the light? Well I'll let you know now that the life of a Shadow Knight is a hard one.  It is a life that is not for one who is weak of the heart or spirit. It is a life of constant conflict, danger and war against the forces of light. A war that must be won at all cost. If you believe you have what it takes, if you are ready for this life, read on. 
        What I will tell you here will help you on the path. But I must say this, I am a human Shadow Knight and I know not how much my advice will help others of different races. As far as is known to me, there is only but four races on Norrath that have memebers that can aspire to be Shadow Knights. Now there may be some exceptions, for I have encountered a Gnoll by the name of Tranixx Darkpaw who did enter the service of my lord and Patron Bertoxxulous. He was granted abilities by our mutual patron in order to clear the "human scum" from his lands. I'm not sure if he was a Shadow Knight like myself, but he did have impressive abilities and any sort of discussion we had was that of a physical nature. As for the other races, I am pretty sure those Shadow Knights have an easier time in their own realm, where a profession such as this is probably more socially acceptable, maybe even encouraged considering their nature. However they are considered members of the so-called hated races, so outside their own citie
s or those of their fellow hated races, life is very hard because one they are hated due their race and two they are hated because they are Shadow Knights. 
<p>
Trolls I know not much of except that what they lack in physical beauty and intelligence, they more than make up for in strength and stamina and must make powerful knights in the physical area. And as for Ogres, I'm sure the brutish, disgusting, louts, could not even read this work to begin with so I will not waste no time considering them at all! (Note: Due to some unfortunate circumstances between Ogres and Darc's parents he is biased against them, but the advice herein should be helpful to them nonetheless.)
        Whether or not you willingly choose to be a Shadow Knight or are chosen by a dark god and granted the gifts, A dark god you must follow. By the power of the god you follow you are granted the abilities that make you a Shadow Knight. Humans have the choice of following Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer or Innoruuk, the Prince of hate. Human Shadow knights who follow Innoruuk, will begin their careers in City of Freeport where I believe there is a shrine to him. Those that follow Bertoxxulous will begin in the city of Qeynos. Pledging yourself to service of either dark god may seem irrelevant at first, but there is something you must consider. Following Bertoxxulous is one thing, following Innoruuk is another. They may be both dark gods, but to follow Innoruuk is to be considered a traitor to your own race as well and will make for hard dealings with others. This can make an already difficult life even harder.
        Dark Elven Shadow Knights have no choice in the area of gods. Not that it matters to them at all. The entire race is devoted to following of their "father", Innoruuk. Dark Elves begin their career in the home of the Dark Elves, Neriak. Troll Shadow Knights have the choice of following Innoruuk or Cazic-Thule - The Faceless lord of fear. Trolls begin in Grobb. Ogres with their incredibly dim wits, blindly worship either the Warlord Rallos Zek or Innorruk. Ogres begin their miserable lives in the city, if such a wretched blight on the land can be called that, Oggok. These races I believe have an easier time in their home cities due to the simple fact that being a shadow is more socially acceptable in these "evil" societies. 
        In the area of abilities, the ones that are important to us are Strength and Stamina to keep us going in battle and Intelligence and Charisma to focus our power and allow us use necromantic spells.
<P>
        The skills available to us are many. We have access to a combination of most of the combat skills and all the magical and trade skills. When you first go to your guildmaster and he give you the opportunity to train in skills. I suggest you train only a little in each skill that you desire just to learn the basics (Spend 1 or 2 practice points). Then use that skill out in real world or under the stress of combat to improve it. Save your practice time (points) for later in your career where you will need/desire to increase your magical abilities quickly. 
We can use just about any weapon there is, except for those of the throwing nature, axes, knives, stars, etc. Any Armor can be worn unless it is specifically for those of another profession. Also there are some items of power that only we may wield. These items are from what I understand extremely rare, and hard to acquire, but worth it if you get it. One example that I know of and personally lust after is a Reaver Blade. I hear these swords besides dealing terrible damage, drain the life energies of the victim. I do not know how true these stories are but I intend to find out. As so should you.
        Now that you know a little about us, let me tell you what we are. We are first and foremost, warriors. At first it may not seem as though we are powerful as pure warriors. Pure warriors and some other professions develop some combat abilities faster (bash, disarm, dodge, double attack, parry, riposte) and some abilities we never achieve (dual wield, kick). Also our magical abilities may pale before those of true necromancers. As a young Shadow Knight you may come to believe you may been as the saying goes, "been short changed." It isn't so. We may not have the pure brute strength or stamina or warriors, but so what, we can steal or deny them of those advantages. You should see the look on a fully armored warrior who has had his strength stolen from him and can no longer support the weight of his armor and weapons. We may share some of the magical abilities that Necromancers possess and they do have access to more magical abilities than we do. These shared abilities, combined with our strength, stamina
 and fighting prowess makes more than even for a Necromancer of equal experience. More so if we are able to get in to close quarters with them. (I will admit though that a battle with a necromancer is tedious and even humorous in a dark way, as both parties drain and steal each other abilities back and forth) These gifts granted to us by our dark gods serve to make us terribly efficient killing machines. So even though we lack some of those other abilities that some of the others have or will take longer to achieve do not despair.  
<p>
At first the only gift you will have available is Harm Touch. With Harm Touch you are able to inflict terrible damage upon your enemies. But you must use this power judiciously, it can be used but once per day. This power is best reserved for getting yourself out of sticky situations. It can easily turn the tide of battle for you, or allow you to take on a foe a bit tougher than yourself (and thus gain more experience). I will admit this power has helped me out on certain times when my guild has required me to kill certain individuals. This power can cut the time spent in a fight very short, allowing me to end the fight and the life of my victim before the guards are even aware there was trouble. The damage dealt by Harm Touch will increase as you gain experience levels, becoming extremely deadly. Beware of one thing: Your Harm Touch is not always infallible, sometimes a target is able to avoid the full affects of your power or even in rare cases resist it. So while it may be very useful, always remember, as 
rare as it may happen, sometimes you may not get the full effect that you need or desire. Aside from harm touch you will appear to other to be only an average warrior until the 9th level of training is reached. My best advice to you is to keep a low profile and work your way to this level of training.
        When the 9th level of training is finally achieved, a whole new world of death and destruction opens to us. Upon reaching 9th level, the dark power within us has grown to point where it acts like mana. 
<p>
With this new found power, spells of deadly effect can be now utilized. To gain these powers upon reaching the 9th level of experience, go to your guild and seek your guildmaster or whoever else will train you there. Use your acquired practice time (Practice Points) to study the magical arts that will allow you to manipulate magical energies into spell effects. These areas of training are Abjure, Alter, Channel, Conjure, Divinate, amd Evoke. There is another skill, Meditate, but that will not be available to you until you reach your 12th level of training. Study these abilities until it comes to a point where the teacher wishes you to pay for them. You can then continue to improve your skills by constantly casting your spells, thereby honing your skills. After you've finished your training in these mystic arts, there should be individuals within your guild/shrine who will sell to you the scrolls that contain the words and runes of knowledge.  These scrolls will show you how to focus your dark power with the m
ystical talents you have learned into the desired spell effects.  To use the scrolls find a safe area and proceed to scribe them into your spell book. (Or whatever you use to permanently scribe your spells, I use shrunken skulls.) After the spells have been scribed you can then memorize them. Once memorized a spell can be cast as many times as you wish, as long as you have power to fuel that spell. Up to eight spells can be memorized at anyone time. The spells will not leave memory unless, you remove them yourselves, or die and go through the trauma of rebirth, which clears out what you have memorized completely. 
As I said before the dark power within us is a gift from our Patron gods, and even though it is very much like manna, it is not, so our spell abilities are limited. We can learn and use some of the spells available to necromancers, but not all. The abilities we do learn are helpful and give us a deadly edge. Use that edge to defeat your enemies.
        At 9th level the spells of Siphon Strength, Disease Cloud, Sense Dead, Locate Corpse, Leering Corpse, Invisibility to Undead and Reclaim Energy. From what I've seen unless you are incredibly talented in the magical area and Intelligence, Invisibility to Undead and Leering corpse will not be available until reaching the 10th level. (Maybe longer if one is really lacking in Intelligence) These spells are not too powerful, but are very useful. Siphon Strength drains the target of its strength and adds that strength to yours. Its effect increases as you gain more experience. (One point of strength transferred per level. The maximum is 10 points transferred.) This spell you will find very useful, your strength will increase allowing you to carry more and do more damage in combat. Even though the effect of casting it multiple times is not cumulative, it still robs the target of its strength. This can possibly reduce the effectiveness of the targets physical attacks or cause it to become overburdened if its 
lower strength can no longer support its weight. This spell is easy to cast and you should always try to maintain a higher level strength. Cast it on whatever is nearby, even weaker creatures, it doesn't matter really. The range on this spell is just under the full distance of your line of sight. It is also very good for baiting creatures to come to you. 
        Disease Cloud is causes the target to become diseased, an effect of this the healing process being brought to a crawl. Another effect of this spell is minor damage inflicted on the target.  This spell is good for baiting targets and slowing down the healing process for them. One other good use of this is to take a creature's attention off of an ally and place it on you. Casting this spell on creatures in combat tends to cause them to focus on you, if it is successful. The range on this spell is also just about your full line of sight.
        Locate corpse. Need I say more? This spell will make the task of locating your corpse and the corpse of others very easy. 
<p>
        Casting sense dead will point you in the direction of the nearest undead entity. Useful if you are hunting undead creatures. Just be aware of the fact that the summoned undead pets of others will be picked up by this spell as well.
        The spell Invisibility to Undead, will render you or your target invisible to the undead. The duration varies with level, but the spell will end immediately if you cast another spell or initiate and offensive action. The best use for this is for avoiding undead creatures when you do not wish to deal with them.
        The spell Leering Corpse will summon an undead servant for you to command. This servant while not too powerful, is very handy to have around. The extra damage done by your pet can turn the tide of battle for you and the pet will even initiate taunt attacks to draw a creature's attention away from yourself. You can instruct your pet to attack creatures, to guard you, or even guard a specific area if you wish. Your pet can be made more useful by giving it a weapon, allowing it to inflict more damage. So my advice is to keep hold of a rusty weapon every now and then so you can give one to your pet when you summon it. There are two other things you should keep in mind with this spell: one, this spell requires reagents to be cast. The reagents are two bone chips. Bone chips are available from some merchants, other adventures, and from some undead creatures. Two, the summoned creature is bound to the area that is summoned. If you leave the area the creature is bound to, it will destroy itself.
        Reclaim Energy will send remove your pet from existence and return some of the energy used in summoning it. The best time to use this spell would be if you don't need your pet and need the energy badly to cast another spell or if your pet is almost destroyed and you need the energy back.
<p>
        More spells will become available as experience levels are gained, these spells will allow you to do more damage and other insidious effects, summon more powerful creatures, and other useful effects. I'll let you discover your own uses for them. Get them as soon as you can, they will make you a thing to feared.
        In the beginning it is hard, make no mistakes about that. But I will give you some advice that may help you in your early career and later on in life. When you first start as a Shadow Knight, learn the very basics of combat from your guildmaster. Then venture out to areas where there are simple creatures you can fight and hone your combat skills on. When you slay these creatures, if you haven't mangled their bodies too much, you might be able to scavenge parts from them. These parts such as rat ears, bat wings, and the like you can sell to merchants. Always consider your targets carefully to make sure that you have a chance at taking them. But remember your Harm Touch, it can get you out of trouble and allow you to take a tougher than normal creature every now and again, thereby gaining you more experience. And remember creatures do vary, just because you had an easy time with one, does not mean the next one might not be tougher or easier fight. Remember that throughout your entire life. Many adventur
ers have died because they thought something was an easy fight, when the beast happened to be an unusually strong specimen. What money you do receive, you should store in a bank. Money should be save for eventually buying better weapons and/or armor. Speaking of better weapons and armor, always be on the look out for creatures that you can defeat that are carrying weapons and armor. You can kill these creatures and take their weapon and armor for yourself. 
        As soon as you can you might also want to invest in a container of some sort. A backpack, sack, box, something along those lines will do. Having a container will mean that you can stay out hunting and collecting that much longer instead spending time running back and forth from the merchants.
        Now depending where you are, not all merchants may deal with you. This problem may not be too apparent in your home city, but may become very much so in other cities. The best way around this is to deeds that will gain you favor with them. I'm not suggesting that you go champion some cause of the accursed light, I'm suggesting something more along the lines of killing creatures that maybe giving the merchants problems, creatures that you would have probably slain anyway. This also holds true for the guards of some cities that may try to kill you on sight. By doing things that gain favor with them, such as killing certain creatures, you can gain enough favor with them to enter a city and remain unmolested. On the subject of being attacked on sight, there are many individuals in the world who will make attempts on your life. Always try to be aware of those around you and consider them to see their general reaction to you. If you are attacked by someone and they are beyond your abilities to take on, run.
 Just remember who they are and add them to your payback list.
<p>
        On the subject of grouping, I would say group whenever possible, especially after level five. Some may object to teaming up with a Shadow Knight, but you'll just have to deal with those individuals. Team up with who ever you can, even with the followers of light, unless of course they are doing something you are very much against. Allies can enter towns for you, purchase items that others refuse to sell you, and other such tasks. USE them, they are a means to an end. Remember that. And who knows you may have them doing things in your favor or even corrupting them. I once had a group of supposed do-gooders slaying beggers in the aqueducts of Qeynos. 
        Remember we are the true warriors of darkness, blessed by our gods with dark powers to defend the darkness against the searing false light. We are the greatest weapon darkness has and though the battle may seem hopeless, we must win. We must defeat these zealots who would hide their weaknesses with a blinding light! Remember never give up the fight and always rage against the light!
