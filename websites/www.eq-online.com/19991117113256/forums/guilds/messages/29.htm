We are recruiting members into the Fellowship of the Griffon.  For additional information contact me at our url and I will be glad to let you in on one of the best guilds on Xegony.  The people we have in the guild truly enjoy role-playing and having fun.  We are based loosely near the Greater Feydark and Butcherblok mountains.  We are a group of holy warriors and spell-using classes that are fairly rounded and we are honing our fighting skills to be an asset to the Gods of Light in the ongoing battles in the world of Norrath.  We were know as BOG or Brotherhood of the Griffon but changed our guild title to be more politically correct.  Thanks for checking us out
