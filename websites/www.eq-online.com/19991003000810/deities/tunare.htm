<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_tunare.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's
 children. The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath,
 which they believe to be a living and breathing Being, to
 blossom and grow. Followers believe that the world of
 Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung
 forth. Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land,
 followers are paying homage and respect to The Mother of
 Their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for them.
 Followers of tumare will fight to the death to protect nature
 in all it's forms. Many Druids, Rangers, and a great many
 Elves follow the ways of Tunare.
