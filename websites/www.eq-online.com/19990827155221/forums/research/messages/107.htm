: : : I would like to say that NOBODY around my level can beat me.  I'm a level 18 enchanter and whenever I duel someone, they die.  Period.  All there is to it is a nice Tashan, Charm, /pet kill  on a tough MOB of your choice.  I Prefer Griffins and Giants.  Then, memory blur the beast that just laid the smack down or zone.  Very rarely do I ever even lose more than 2 bubbles of life.  Tashan casts in like half a second and then poof!  They are your bitch.  So, before commenting on other classes that you have never played past newbie status, pull your head out of your ass and realize THE class.  But, I must agree on one thing.  Fellow enchanters whine too fucking much about how they are weak.  Learn to play your class.  Learn how to debilitate a monster that should normally kill you in a way that makes him easy.   And I'd like to see you walk into a city that hates your guts and walk around carefree.  PLUS, we can make all those nice trinkets that everyone loves.  Enchanters are a VERY unique and fun class.  Someday, I will be running a griffin around for a pet and smushing other griffins.  Until then,  I'll stick to avoiding them like the plague.   hehe  =)<p>: : I love my enchanter.  Although only lvl 10, he can still do a lot.  I can't wait to get the charm spell and get my own pet that's not an animation.  What lvl does one have to be to get the charm spell?  Also, what does Tashan do and what lvl do you have to be to get it?  Thx.<p>: I am a level 15 enchanter.  I have killian animation and charm.  Yes I love to blast them.  Most people tank for me while I cast the only problem is yes we are weak in strenght. Does our strenght ever get better? Do we ever become strong? I want to learn to fight as well as enchant<p>I too have a level 18 enchanter, and they are the best class.  i have never dueled with him, but i have used charm and charmed pets DO follow commands for enchanters.  not only do you get charm, a pet that can compete with the magician and necros' (just cant follow commands), you also get haste, languid pace, tashan series, whirl 'till you hurl series, direct damage that is second only to the wizard (yes enchanters have better DD than magicians), fear series, blind, the rune series, and you can turn yourself into virtually anything in the game via illusion.  <p>i heard somewhere that at late levels (44, 49) you get the best spells in the game, these easily top the best spells of other classes such as ice comet of the wizards (level 49, 1100 damage).  i heard there are spells that will switch your HPs with any other MOBs.  just imagine switching about 500 or so hps of yours with vexa the dragon's 16000.  that is better damage than a wizard and better healing than a cleric.  there are also rumors of WICKED finales of the whirl 'till you hurl series, which is supposed to start spinning them around rooted doing massive amounts of damage and eventually turning them upside down.  <p>enchanters are not the weakest, they are just as feeble as the necromancer, magician, and wizard (combat-wise) but i believe that the enchanter is the best class, not too unbalanced as to make anybody rush to them.  they cant do it all on their own, they dont have any healing spells, they cant portal to the alter planes, they cant tank (although their pets do a damn good job) and there are also a lot of other things they cannot do.  i make the claim that they are the best class because they are the best soloing class (dont tell me they arent, i kill yellows with ease when i rank and blacks just before i rank again, id like to see a warrior ever kill a black, much less a yellow, and im not talking about a level 1 in full banded which im sure many of you are guilty of doing) and they also are an excellent grouping class with haste, tashan for other spell casters in the group, and good direct damage.<p>in response to your specific questions you can get tashan at level 1, tashani at level 20 (im not sure if there are any others in the series)  you get charm at level 12 and it is a series, so there are things like beguile and alluring grasp and stuff that are more powerful charm spells.
