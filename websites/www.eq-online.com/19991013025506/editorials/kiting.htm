I use the term issue loosely as I do not see this as an "Issue" in Everquest.  If you want to talk about issues there are plenty more to be addressed, such as the DOT bug, broken classes, and annoying bugs that have been there since the game hit beta.
In this editorial I will be addressing the proposed "fix" to the kiting "issue" that Verant might implement.  And the classes it would effect.  If your class is not necessarily a kiting class you might not get much out of this editorial but might want to read it anyway.
<p>
Verants proposed fix to the kiting "issue" is simple.  Basically if you are not familiar with kiting, let me take a minute to explain how it works.  Classes that have DoT's get the most out of kiting, I have seen magicians kite as well, but generally I think most people that take advantage of kiting are Necro's, Shamans, and Druids.
As all these classes have DOT type spells.  Kiting is when you cast Spirit of the wolf, or use Journeyman boots to speed you up.  Then proceed to DOT the target you want to kite.  Players use this against things that they could normally not solo alone.
Such as giants, NPC's, guards, etc.  Necromancers with Journeyman boots are probably the most effective at this, since they have a wide range of high damage DOT's and spells that significantly slow the target.
<P>
Now here is what Verant is proposing to do, they want to make it so that if YOU the caster cast a DOT on a target and are not in melee range, it will do no damage.  Now this brings up many issues, here are a few:
<p>
1. With the current DOT bug, DOT's cannot be used in combat as it causes the corpse to disappear.  Pissing the group off as the body is now gone which means no loot and also you usually get no experience either, the body just disappears.
This makes it very hard for Necromancers to get into groups because of the simple fact that unless they are fighting undead the highest amount of Direct damage you can do is 160 until level 44!!
<p>
2. To have an NPC basically immune to a spell effect is ludicrous.
<p>
3. How many casters are ever in melee range normally?
<p>
4. DOT's are useless in groups, making them not work unless caster is in melee range makes those types of spells completely useless.
<p>
In all honesty I see this affecting Necromancers the most.  I kited with my necromancer for a simple reason.  I WAS NOT effective in groups, I had a wide range of DOT spells that I could not use in a group.
My pet got schooled by everything at that level.  Basically I got a DD spell at 24th that did 160 max, and not a new one till 44th.  And doing 160 over and over on the same mob at level 39 really doesnt do much except piss it off.
SO I kited, and I gained levels, I solo'd from 24 to 44th all by kiting.  And I am damn glad I was able to do it.  I feel for all the up and coming necro's who wont be able to do this.
<p>
Now with Shamans and druids I dont see to much of a problem, both classes have great spells that groups want/need, and they should have no problem getting into a group.  So they are not going to rely on kiting as much as a necromancer would.
I could be wrong though, they might not want to be in groups and I have no problem with that, more power to em if they can kite to gain levels.
I dont see why so many people have a problem with Kiting, I don't see it as an "Issue" that needs to be addressed I honestly see it as jealousy of the classes that CANNOT kite.
They are pissed one or a few classes can do something they cant.  
<p>
They are pissed you are able to kill a guard solo and they cant.  Big deal.  Things like this piss me off, next thing you know we will have casters in plate, warriors with innate spell abilities, etc.
The list goes on.  What I dont think many people realize is that this has been going on since early beta.  I would say the Bard was one of thee best characters to play in beta, but now I wouldn't play one at all.
Why?  Because people got jealous of the bards capabilities in combat.  I saw a bard solo a hill giant (he did not use charm at all btw) in beta.  People of course bitched about this and *whamo* the bard got gimped immediately.
And continued to get messed with all through beta and into final.  If you could actually see what a beta bard before the gimp could do you would be amazed.
