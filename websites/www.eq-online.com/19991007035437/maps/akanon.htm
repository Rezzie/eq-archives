One being what the player who submitted us this map calls, "The basement".  You can also visit King Ak'anon.  Below are some maps of the various places in Ak'Anon.</font>

<font face="helvetica" size="4"><b><a href="basement.htm">The Basement</a></b></font><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">"The Basement" is a slang name for an area in Ak'anon where monsters run wild.  Apparently the Clockworks who work and live in Ak'anon have stored all their obsolete clockwork models in this "Basement".  To get to the basement you need to find the Scrapyard.  The Scrapyard is the area right outside the door to the Basement on the map.<p>
This area isnt to dangerous, but you have to watch out if attacking the obsolete models.  If you attack one near others, there is a chance the others will come to it's aid.  When I first ventured in here at level 2 I nearly was killed by 3 attacking obsolete models.  I ran out the door to have the guard (a large mechanical clockwork spider) take out the obsolete's for me, but he didn't.
Well needless to say I almost died, so watch your step in here :)  There are other monsters besides obsolete models that you can attack.  These include Rock Spiders, Rock Snakes, and Decaying Gnome Skeletons.  It's kind of maze like in the Basement, and I haven't found anything of real value in there, but I didn't look real hard either :)  I will be producing a map for EQO of the "Basement" area.
Also, while I was there I did manage to kill a few obsolete models.  It seems that killing these obsolete units improves your reputation with the regular clockworks.  This is just a theory.  But I noticed that a few NPC's that treated me harshly treated me nicer after slaying a few of the obsolete models.  And you do take a "faction hit" for killing them.</font>

<font face="helvetica" size="4"><b>The Steamfont Mountains</b></font><p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">The Steamfont mountains are home to some nasty creatures, and some cool looking landmarks.  There is a Skeletal dragon carcass near Akanon, some pretty powerful creatures hang out here, so I wouldn't advise getting to close when you are low level.  There is also a Kobold camp that is usually home to 3 Kobolds.<p>
Attacking all these three at the same time is something you want to wait to do until you are higher level.  Or have a decent party.  There are a few windmills and various NPC's living in the area surrounding Ak'anon.  There is also some ruins in a hard to find spot near Ak'anon, but I never saw any monsters there.  I'll have to investigate that more later :)
There are paths that lead out of the Steamfont Mountains to the Lesser Feydark.  There are many beasts around Ak'anon.  When you start out fight the Kobold Runts, Large rats, and Decaying gnome skeletons.  Note that Decaying skeletons and Decaying Gnome skeletons are two different creatures.  With the Decaying skeleton being alot more difficult to kill than the Decaying Gnome skeleton<p>
After you hit level 2 start fighting infected rats and spiderlings.  When you hit level 4 take on the kobolds at the kobold camp and also you can start fighting some of the Rogue Clockworks, like the Rogue cleaners and spiders.  There are much more dangerous creatures in the zone like Puma's, Skeletons, Ebon Drakes, and Minotaur Slavers, but to start out fight the little stuff.</font>

<font face="helvetica" size="2">The Ak'anon Zoo is near the bank area, for your viewing enjoyment :)  There is an error on the map though, I thought there was a Black bear in the last cage, but it is actually a Puma.
