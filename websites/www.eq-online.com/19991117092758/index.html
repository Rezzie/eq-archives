<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Player run event on Erollisi Marr</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">The Cimmerii congregated inside the Temple that honored Innoruuk. Gathering quietly, each member looked at the others, they were all steadfast in their desire. They
were about to commit an unholy ceremony, an ancient rite long since dead, revived by a vision and spread amongst Innoruuk’s most faithful followers. With a shared look
the ritual began. 
<p>
The members of The Semai approached the Altar of Desecration, a large jet-black tome in hand. Ceremoniously, they set the massive book on the Altar and whispered a
prayer. This was The Tome of Hate, the Bible of Innoruuk. The midnight runes warded the Temple from those that dared to bring harm. The Ritual would not be disturbed,
powerful magiks of a God shielded their work from the eyes of mortals. 
<p>
Next, the soldiers of The Bloody Hand walked to the Altar. With them they carried the shroud of a freshly slain specter, many of them still wore the wounds of the battle.
They placed the robe on the Altar, each saying a prayer and took their positions next to The Semai. 
<p>
Finally, The Shield made their way to the Altar. They carried the final ingredient of their ritual. The Hate Stone. The Hate Stone was a key, a key to the Plane of Hate, a
link between the mortal world and the splendor of Eternal Hate, the Home of Innoruuk. Setting it on the Altar, they said their prayers in turn and took their positions as
well. 

With all the items in place, the Archmage Tzimisce and his Semai brother, Shaile, began the incantations. The members of the Hand and the Shield prayed to Innoruuk,
strengthening the bond between them and Innoruuk. 

A blue flame appeared above the Altar, slowly growing larger and deeper in hue. They knew if they were weak in their Hatred, they would not survive the Ritual. Such is
the whim of Innoruuk. Those not pure in their Hatred must, and will, perish. Upon reaching a deep indigo color, the flame burst forth with a black light, a moan drifted from
the flame, a sound more horrible than any death imaginable. 
<p>
It was the tormented scream of a thousand lives, it was the sound of pure Hatred. 

The Ritual was a success and Innoruuk had blessed The Cimmerii with His Hate. He had sent them The Blackness to help them with their vile and corrupt deeds. The
Blackness was a void in the darkness, a pit of incomprehensible horror, a festering pool of evil and hatred. The dark form shifted slightly in the gloom, barely detectable. It
opened its gaping maw in a silent scream as its form twisted in the candlelight. A mass of disfigured body parts and captured souls, The Blackness eyed its masters,
hungry for their lives. The Hate of the members of The Cimmerii held The Blackness away, for they were Pure in their Hate, and no harm would come to them. 
<p>
The thoughts of his masters reached the mind of The Blackness; evil deeds, cruel and wicked.
Others, yes, he would feed on others. 

"You know your duty, Go!" the Archmage said. 
<p>
The apparition shifted slightly and disappeared into the dead of the night seeking its prey and hungry for their souls.

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Well...</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Here is the main page in the new format, we are re-doing the entire site still, it has been a major pain in the A**.
But hey, when it all goes up it will be worth it :)  Anyways, today we plan to get the spells section up under the new format.  A couple changes, each spell will have its own page.
Listing components if a research spell, mana cost, casting time, location sold (even enchanters), etc.  So we are busily re-doing that, by the time we get done, the entire site will have alot more information
and it will also be arranged a little better.  Sorry for the lack of updates but Nixx and I have been super busy.  I think everyone will love the new site.

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Bugglegupp sighting!!!</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">Blakwidow, a friend of ours from the Cazic thule server sent me some mail this morning regarding Bugglegupp.
You may have heard of this troll if your a gnome, I have, but have never seen it.  Here is screenshot proof that the troll exists.  Here is the storie that she sent me:
<p>
Hi Wraith!
<br>
Just a quick mail to let you know what happened to me this morning, I killed Bugglegupp!  Here's the storie post it if you like on your website.
I was getting ready to leave Akanon this morning to go do some quests for my necro words when I got a tell from a 5th level enchanter named Surreniel.
She asked for help.  I asked her what was wrong and she replied that she was killed by a troll.  A troll in Steamfont?  I immediately asked her if it was Bugglegupp
but she did not know, and only told me that whatever it was poisoned her and the guards would not kill it.
<p>
Intrigued at this point I asked her to show me where she was attacked.  Apparently she had been cycling the kobold camp over near the druid ruins.
The aprox. loc was -580,1760.  She had to log so I called up a pet and sat down.  After about 10 minutes I got bored and went afk.  I came back to see a damage scroll as my pet beat the crap out of Bugglegupp.
Attached are the screenshots of the corpse and the loot.  It does drop the fabled "Iron pellet" used for a quest in Akanon, unfortunately I do not have good faction with the Elderitch Collective so I could not complete the quest.
And the item was no drop, so I couldnt use a mule either.  And when I gave it to the guy in Akanon he just screamed at me =)
<p>
Anyways I hope this answers a few questions, Bugglegupp does exist! =)  This is my first time in 44 levels to ever see the troll, no one to my knowledge has ever seen this troll.
<p>
Thanks Blak!  Here are the screenshots she sent:

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Tunare reveals herself</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">
Tunare showed up on Tallon Zek Saturday night.
<p>
My character looked in awe as his aid to Miss Vie helped her find Tunare. A 
circle of 13 Sisters of Tunare was formed for her coming. Before that, my 
bard Tasho helped Miss Vie find the people she sought. Tasho wept as he saw 
his Goddess.
<p>
The goddess made our shot of the day.
<p>
<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Slowly but surely...</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">We are converting the site over to the new format, the bard song list is newly converted.
Check it out here, slowly we will be getting to each page here and changing it (as you can see with the Bard songs) to make it more
accessible, and also more printer friendly.  Hope you like the changes, more coming!
