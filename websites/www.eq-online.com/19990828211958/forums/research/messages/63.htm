: I am going to start a new charachter as a Dark-Elf. I cannot decide what to be.  I am looking at Necromancer, Wizard or Magician.  I want to be powerful enough to really kick ass, and fend for myself.  If you could just tell me the pro's and cons of each class i would be very thankful.<br>: Mantise<p>
