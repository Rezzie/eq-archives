: I would like to say that NOBODY around my level can beat me.  I'm a level 18 enchanter and whenever I duel someone, they die.  Period.  All there is to it is a nice Tashan, Charm, /pet kill  on a tough MOB of your choice.  I Prefer Griffins and Giants.  Then, memory blur the beast that just laid the smack down or zone.  Very rarely do I ever even lose more than 2 bubbles of life.  Tashan casts in like half a second and then poof!  They are your bitch.  So, before commenting on other classes that you have never played past newbie status, pull your head out of your ass and realize THE class.  But, I must agree on one thing.  Fellow enchanters whine too fucking much about how they are weak.  Learn to play your class.  Learn how to debilitate a monster that should normally kill you in a way that makes him easy.   And I'd like to see you walk into a city that hates your guts and walk around carefree.  PLUS, we can make all those nice trinkets that everyone loves.  Enchanters are a VERY unique and fun class.  Someday, I will be running a griffin around for a pet and smushing other griffins.  Until then,  I'll stick to avoiding them like the plague.   hehe  =)<p>Enchanter pets dont respond to commands..
