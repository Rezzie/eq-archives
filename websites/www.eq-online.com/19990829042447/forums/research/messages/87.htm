  Just so everyone knows, enchanters are a VERY VERY powerful class at high lvls. It is definatly worth playing one up to lvl 30+.. they get very powerful, and i cant stress this enough. A high lvl enchanter can beat many classes in a duel easy. For instance against a wizard. A enchanter can drain a wizards mana in approx 20 sec, and then kill him/her in two casts. The rune series of spells is great. Its nice to be able to turn into werewolfs :) and there are some great buffs... So to say enchanters "SUCK" Is bad judgment on anyones part. <p>: First of all, Enchanters are a Tactical Combat class .. second of all, this proves you have no tact. Simply play those classes that have something strong to them. Enchanters have a spell called Tashan to reduce Magic Resistance, Laguid Pace to lessen the rate of being beat up, Charm to kill something and in turn kill it too (great for experience), Soothe to prevent masses of mobs running after you, Memory Blur to steal kills (heh) or get mobs off of you, Enduring Breath to help actually brave Kedge's Keep (I don't think anyone has gone inside it yet), the ability to Enchant Metals (Some good stuff), Choke for DoT then follow up with Chaotic Feedback, and illusions for play.<p>: What is the problem with that?<p>
