They are the secretive, mysterious class of the world, who sneak about 

          in the dark. Some say they are assassins, and some that they are nothing 

          but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and 

          they are capable of both. They are quite skilled with many weapons, 

          but they cannot stand toe to toe with a Warrior and prefer to make the 

          kill by a sudden attack from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. 

          They would much prefer to not be discovered at all, or if they are, 

          to not be there for their opponent's blow to land. The darker skills 

          of picking locks and stealing are also their forte.
