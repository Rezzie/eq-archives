There is still one thing I have not seen, what exactly did they do to screw up your characters so bad?<p>If you want me to post the reasons I think enchanters suck and the idea's that lead me to beleive this was NOT a well thought out class here ya go:<p>1.  They tried to make Enchanters the "do everything" mage, you get buffs/conjures/pets/illusions/etc.  They tried to make this to broad and it screwed them.<p>2.  By only including a few spells that can be used or employed by enchanters in group or combat situations the creators made this spell the crutch of the class, now if this spell is tweaked in any way you get what everyone has been seeing the last few days or so.  THey should have included a few DIFFERENT offensive/combat type spells to allow the Enchanter a little variety and also to make them more appealing to a group looking for a spellcaster.<p>3.  If it is not bad enough that the enchanter gets very few offensive spells, they gimped them to the point that they are resisted often.<p>These are some of the reasons I think this class should be scrapped and possibly replaced with a more balanced, well thouhgt out, and funner class to play.  This of course is my opinion but I am sure many agree with it.<p>Nixx<p>
