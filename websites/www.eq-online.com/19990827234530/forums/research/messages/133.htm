I have a level 25th Enchanter.  Yes we do get better with age.  At level 18 I dueled a level 18 Necromancer and lost one bubble of life while he took a dirt nap.  Why?  I resisted every DoT spell he threw at me.  At my level, people are starting to realize the value of an enchanters abilities to stun and debuff the monsters we fight.  We don't need to beg or plead for a healer on board, since we hardly ever take damage.  Levels 18-20 are the hardest to get through I believe.  Seems an the ugly duckling stage when you don't have enough health and you are still working with level 16th spells.<p>Enjoy the enchanter class, but don't get upset when you get 30 messages an hour with people asking you can you come to town to enchant metal.
