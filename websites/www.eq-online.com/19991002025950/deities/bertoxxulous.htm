<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=254 SRC="d_bertoxxulous.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on Norrath

 is that everything dies. They view the decay of flesh as a

 thing of ultimate beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh

 bruise, the almost irridescent yellow green of an infested

 pustule, are but a few of the things that His followers

 relish. It is not suprising that many of His followers pursue

 the dark art of Necromancy, for to them nothing is more

 desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in

 unlife, continue to rot and decay. Do not take this to mean

 that His followers are suicidal or seek a quick death. To

 the contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading

 their dark, diseased stain across all of Norrath.
