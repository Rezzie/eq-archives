: I am an aspiring enchanter and was wondering what the spells mesmerize,charm and alliance do, i have heard that charm is like summoning a pet, but it is just using an enemy to be your pet, but if that is true, does that mean that an enchanter could have two pets??? One from their animations and one from the charm??<p>: Dunno, just asking, i know that no one likes enchanters any way, but when the new race war server comes out i am gonna make a dark elf enchanter and rule all the lands(LOL) well thanks in advance for anyone who helps me out with this<p>No you can not charm if you have a pet already.  Such as killian animaiton or jillian animation.  Your spells are not as effective.  I am currently in south row and charm does work on dvarves but it only last for a sort while; it also depends upon how much immune they are to your spells sometimes your spells do not work and your get your but kicked.<br>However, charm is basically used to kill others of their own kind.  I hope that helps you
