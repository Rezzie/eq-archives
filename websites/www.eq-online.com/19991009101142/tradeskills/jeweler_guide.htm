<p>

First off I do not recomend anyone even attempting Jewelry unless they
are an Enchanter, and I recomend all Enchanters learn this skill.  This
skill has to be the most exspensive skill in the game but should be the
most rewarding.
<p>
The First thing a successful Jeweler wants to do is put 20 skill points
into Jewelry.  The cost of putting 20 points into Jewelry is much less
than the 40+p it will cost you to get your skill this high.  Besides all
Enchater skills except their weapon skill will go up quickly with use
untill level 16 where you learn to Research, and you should be able to
save 20 points by level 5 with no problem.
<p>
Next you will need a Jeweler Kit.  This should cost less than 2p.  And
you may want to buy the book on Jewelry which is a few gold.  While I
still have seen no proff as to the need for the book there are rumors
that it helps your success rate.
<p>
Now comes the Exspensice part.  A bar of silver will cost you around 6g
and your first gem should cost you about the same.  Buy one of each,
place them in the bag and see what happens.  Players most likely will
not buy your succeses until you can make weading rings and Engagment
rings(while these are not magical they are a nice Role Playing element)
So sell them to the shop keeper that will give you the most for them at
a loss and use what you have left to try again.
<p>
If a stone is ever too simple for you try going up at least 2 or 3
gems(rated by cost) your succes will be less but your skill seems to go
up faster.  When you are finnaly start trying to combine Jades and
larger gems this is where you begin to see the rewards of your efforts.
I found I was able to make a Jade ring at skill level 32 and was about
50% successful.  Make sure that you enchant the silver before you make
the item, as rings(Jade and up for silver) seem to be able to be sold to
the merchants at a minor proffit(1s for Jade).  For a price range of
silver magic rings it looks like stones that cost less than 3.5p will
not work.  My understanding is that Enchanted Electrum always produces
magic items with any stone but this apparantly requires a skill of at
least 40 and the level 16 Enchanter Spell Enchant Electrum.
<p>
As a final note I have only been able to make the first two magic rings
as of yet and neither is in high demand in my area.  The first Ring is a
+5 mana.  This is a bit vague and if it's a total 5 mana it's not worth
the 5p you have to charge for it.  The second gem, Pearl, is a +4 vs.
Poison which may be nice in an area with poisones snakes like East
Commons.  The Third Gem I hear is +4 vs. Poison and Disease and two of
these could make peoples life alot easier and may be worth close to 8p
per ring.
<p>
Good luck with the Jewelry skill Enchanters.  And everyone else Look me
up if you're ever in town.
