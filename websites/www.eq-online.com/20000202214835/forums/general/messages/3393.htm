Not that I have any plans for selling accounts or characters, but here is a point I would like to make.  The possibility of selling such things (have you seen the prices accounts/characters/online items and money are selling for on E-Bay?) is strong motivation for some people to play.  People who might otherwise quit and find something else to do because they have played Everquest until it has gotten boring will continue to play for financial gain.  They will be paying money to play.  Also, if they sell an account, and they want to build up a new account to do it again, they will be paying even more money.  That is money in the pocket of the people in charge of the game.  It seems to me that it is in the best interest of the people in charge to allow this to continue.  How does this affect game play?  I don't know. Frankly, I could care less if that 50th level player I walk by in Freeport is being played by the person who built them up to that level or by some person who shelled out a few thousand dollars for it.  Of course, things might be different on a pkilling server.  It would suck if your arch-rival bought a much more powerful character and proceeded to make your life hell.
