Greetings all again, earlier I wrote an editorial to Everquest Online about adventuring parties.  I would like to give you another look at how adventuring parties work, and tell you of my adventure with a great group of people.  Earlier I wrote about some negative things about adventuring parties.  I should have realized the game was new and no one was trying to be rude, just new and trying to figure out the game.  So here is what an adventuring party is like after a couple weeks of play.  

<p>

I started off last night in Kelethin, my bard is now almost 6th level.  To gain any decent experience in the Greater Feydark I must fight orcs, which can be hard to do alone.  So I headed to a hill outside Kelethin where the vile orc hordes are known to inhabit.  While waiting for an onslaught of beasts, I saw a young elven ranger named Shanna, and her companion a wizard of unknown level named Zeldar.  I approached them and we started talking.  Apparently Shanna had died and was waiting for a third companion to join them for a corpse recovery.  I volunteered my services being a bard I had a song that allowed me to locate corpses rather easily.

<p>

They agreed and we set off.  In the middle of recovering the corpse, while I stood guard as Shanna was grabbing her stuff, orcs attacked.  We faced an orc oracle, which is kind of like an orc mage or cleric, a nasty centurion, and a little orc pawn just there to make us mad.  I started to fight as did Shanna.  But we were outmatched, I stopped singing the corpse song, and started singing Selo's Asscelendro to speed us up and ran.  Trying to draw the orcs off Shanna who was now getting low on hp's with 3 orcs beating on her.  I managed to draw the Centurion off, who was doing a good job of killing me.  So I ran, and picked up about 3 more in tow on the way back to Kelethin.

<p>

Zeldar had also died.  Once again we set off to find the corpses.  I managed to locate 2 corpses of Zeldar, the latest one and one he could not find earlier :-).  We fought many orcs again, and then headed back to Kelethin.  Shanna needed to log, and we said are goodbyes.  Zeldar was still up for some hunting.  So we headed back to the hill.  There we met a very nice Ranger named Abadon.  Where we then again formed a party consisting of me, Abadon, and Zeldar.  We fought a few more orcs, and then I received a tell from a freind named Deedlith.  Her companion had died in Lesser Feydark and needed someone to locate the corpse.  Without hesitation I agreed and we were off to Lesser Feydark.

<p>

We met Deedlith and her companion Raidiant at the entrance to Lesser Feydark.  They joined our group and we headed off to find Raidiants corpse.  It was quite a ways away, over by the zone border leading to the Steamfont mountains.  We headed over there as fast as we could only stopping breifly as I received updates from my song on the location of the body.  Once we reached the corpse we found that is was on top of a huge mountain we could not climb, Zeldar tried to brave the steep cliffs and fell to his death.  After he rejoined us we decided to party together.  Now we were a group of five.  Including Me a 5th level Bard, Raidiant an 8th level Cleric, Deedlith a 5th level Druid, Abadon a 7th level Ranger, and Zeldar an unknown level Wizard.  With Raidiant and Deedlith healing, Abadon and I tanking (taking all the damage), and Zeldar frying the baddies with his spells we had a chance, although until we actually fought something we would not know how effective we would be.

<p>

Boy, were we effective!  We started out on Orc Centurions in Lesser Feydark.  Most of them con'd red to the rest of us which meant certain death.  However Abadon con'd them yellow since he was the highest level in the party.  Suddenly while watching one walking off in the distance.  Deedlith was struck, we quickly went into action, Abadon and I immediately squaring off against the beast and the healers healing us as we took the furious blows the orc centurion dealt out.  Success!  We slayed the orc centurion.  Then shortly after that another one wandered by, this one carried a sword, a target we could not pass up.  We slayed him as well.  I took the spoil, a rusty broadsword, and gave it to Abadon.  Seeking touger prey, namely puma's, we headed to the Steamfont mountains.  There we fought kobolds for awhile and met our 6th party member.  A ranger named Shar.  She had been attacking kobolds at 4th level!  A fearless warrior.  With her joining us we then went on to kill 3 puma's.  And as our final victory a you





ng ebon drake!  Which conning it said it would be death for Abadon to attack!  It was hard to kill, but with our healers backing us and the rest throwing blows into the beast it finally toppled.  I took a screenshot of it.

<p>

EQ is a great game.  I consider myself lucky to have found such wonderful people with which to adventure with, and will hopefully group with them again soon :-).
