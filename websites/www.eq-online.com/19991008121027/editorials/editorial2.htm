<FONT SIZE=2><P>Necromancer</P>

<P>These are the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based spells, they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from their victims.</P>



<P>This class is one of my most favorite classes…. Yes,  I like playing the dark side not as a PK or a Evil character but then again I do like being evil.  I have found many things to hold true with this class my spells by far not being the most powerful of magic while at the same time being given some of own spells with a twist of lemon.  The necromancer is the evil cleric type traveling in the lands looking for all evil that bids.  I find myself traveling in the dark corners of the Trolls, and Ogres on many journeys.  Being evil has been one of the best times I have had because you find yourself an outcast not only by the NPC’s but other players.  Yes other players I find shun me because of choices that I have made and the god’s I don’t believe in.  Playing an evil class is not always that fun for traveling but can be very surprising.</P>



<P>This is the journey of the evil one.  Starting out I found myself in a strange new land as a young child.  I ventured out in a quest to learn my magic and fine more power within.  I learned an early age with the power of thought I could take strength from my foes and even the healing word that will take the health from one to me!  This was just my early starting point I have sense found many powers within being able to enchant bones to become my friend where others draw away from me as friends.  The bones hold magical properties and can fight in a magical way taking over where I cannot lead.  Myself being a strong minded person and not a fighter type this worked out great in my travels.  Learning spells to aid me in the fighting I will partake on my many findings.  People in the world and I use this in general from vendors to players will not treat me good.  They say my beliefs and ways of magic offend them.  Bringing up skeletons as friends was an easy choice on my early learning’s.  Many people wouldn’t 





sell me goods or even help out a necro you may find this a clash for the ways of training.  Once I got started on my way I found being a Necro only improved as I grew in powers people now wanted to be my friend people that spit on me in the starting are now saying Hello will you travel with me.  Well this started a new chapter in my life having people that wanted to now travel in the long journeys with me that I take.</P>



<P>Finding friends in the larger world is not hard but you will find being one with a negative belief or what others think it is negative was hard.  You find me once I got to a standing of an equal with a lot of the races I started helping the other evil friends out on travels.  When most talk out asking for help getting food and water or even being tied to the foreign land and no one will help I always jump in.  In my lands you only see me helping people I know that have a good attitude towards evil and help anyone just because they can.  I have been know to give away to a foreign traveler to a new land 20+ food and water just because they are evil and no one else will help them.  Remember in a land of friends you can use the banks and stores while in the land of the enemy you cannot!  Getting people to convert all your copper and silver to a more carryable plat is something of a service and not something that is done for most.  Once you start making friends traveling becomes a great time.  Finding the best 





battles and the nicest and most quite places to rest are always good.  With in all this time my powers are growing greatly.</P>



<P>Now I am hit with a new found magic…. I can make skeletons that are as powerful as most warriors on the world of the same level of learning.  My power became strong and a very powerful too in any battle.  Getting a warrior friend did start being a issue because now my pet maybe able to kill things quickly with my magic helping greatly I just couldn’t find my frail self taking all the damage.  I have now learned magic from Poison to Heart Flutter and well beyond.  My magic can do multiple effects from drawing life in the upper double digits to boiling blood in the triple digits from the most I can tell.  Once I cast this strong magic I normally have to wait a period of time for the effect to finalize.  The best part of this is hearing all the players at higher levels saying how the necro is one of the worst classes to fight and in the beginning they make your life very hard.  The biggest thing through all my journeys is always make friends as you go and don’t forget the ones that have done you wrong they mi





ght come to you later and ask for your power and all you have to say is…… Why do you need me now you didn’t need me when you were level X in fact you made it very hard for me to live in your world.  </P>



<P>The Necromancer class is a very strong class within the magic learned it is hard to start but as your power grows you will find yourself a cleric type for you and your pet and being able to give sympathy to friends in need with dark empathy and heal them at the cost of your own health.</P>



<P>Please any questions feel free to post in the message boards I have been told that Daknor or someone will respond to them thanks…..</P>
