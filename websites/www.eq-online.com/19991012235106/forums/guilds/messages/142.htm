I have many names, although you may know me as Kithcanen. I'm a 12th level, wood elf, warrior from the idylic tree-city of Kelithen in the majestic environs of Greater Faydar.  <br>I have traveled near and far, trying to be of service where I may.   Throughout my journeys I have sought a guild that stands for justice and altruism, that would be as beacon of hope to the masses of Norrath.  <br>If you are a member of such a guild I would be honored if you would consider my aplication.<br>Your humble aspirant, Kithcanen.
