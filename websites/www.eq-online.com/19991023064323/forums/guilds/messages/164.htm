I am creating a guild that is composed of clerics and possibly other healers like paladins, druids, and maybe shamans. It is in the<br>beggining stages, but i need to have support and interest in order to make the guild. I have made them before and then asked for<br>memebers, but no one had any say in the creation, so I am doing things differently this time. If anyone is interested please email me -<br>i have 4 people so far, I'd look forward to hearing from you all. Farladar - Human 9 cleric - Bertroxxulous server<br>farladar@yahoo.com
