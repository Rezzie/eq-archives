The Emerald Covenant Reborne!<p>Greetings Fellow Adventurers,<br>     I bring you news of an event which has transpired in the last several weeks.  The Emerald<br>Covenant, a guild which was originally intended to be based on the Rallos Zek( PVP )<br>server, has been reborne.  A growing group of fellow adventurers and I have decided that<br>PVP in EverQuest was never meant to be, and is not what we expected or want any <br>longer.  Consequently, when the next new server opens its doors, we are all going to<br>pick up and make our home there, getting a fresh start with fresh players.  We are looking<br>for prospective members, those who wish also to leave behind the burden of the<br>slowly decaying and already decadent PVP server, those who are on other servers and<br>would like to switch for the opportunity to take part in the creation of a great group of <br>players and an incredible guild, or even those just starting out in search of mentors to<br>help you on your way in the world.  Our main goals and objectives remain what they<br>were before the release of the commercial version of EverQuest; namely the promotion<br>of an interwoven roleplaying environment, intense cooperation and organization among<br>members, extensive exploration of new dungeons, areas, and quests, and most importantly<br>the desire to use our numbers to encourage positive changes to the world of EverQuest.<br>If you think you might be interested in joining, please feel free to send me email at <br>the address listed below.  If you have any questions or comments, or just want more<br>information, you can also contact me.  So, in short, if you think you might want to get<br>a fresh start with a fresh group of players and get off on the right foot in a tightly <br>bound group of dedicated adventurers, The Emerald Covenant might be what you<br>are looking for!<p>Hail and Goodhunt,<br>Mustapha Kentaro <Emerald Covenant><br>dcc5500@rit.edu
