The Teir'Dal Empire is now recruiting for the race war server. We are strictly an all Dark Elf guild that will take over all of Norrath and destroy the lesser races. All others will be KOS, with the exception of most Trolls and Ogres. Nothing will be able to stop the all powerful Teir'Dal in our conquest to rule all of Norrath. I am currently seeking active role players who would like a high position in the guild. I'm looking for someone who is able to create very good websites since I'm not very good at it. I'm also looking for leaders of each class that the Teir'Dal is allowed to choose. I will accept any Teir'Dal into our ranks. If you are interested in being a part of this indestructable guild to be, e-mail at dj111@ibm.net and include the following:<br>    <br>Your expected user name<br>Your expected class<br>Include wether or not you want a good position, including a webpage creator<br>Include why you want to join this guild and what you will do to enhance it.<p>I will give out high ranks to people with the best reasons of wanting to join the guild and ways of enhancing it. I'll e-mail everyone back who wishes to join, so don't wait on joining!
