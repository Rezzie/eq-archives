How do you know the other player picked your pocket?<p>I've had rogues pass by, and had them display a message that my pocket had been picked, but nothing and no money was missing.  So maybe the rogue was just jerking your chain a little?<p>(In heavily camped areas, some players delight in sending false messages.  Something like "Drune crushes Vexven Mucktail for 18 points of damage!!"  All the camped players will leap to their feet at that.)<p>:-)<p><br>

: How do you know the other player picked your pocket?

: I've had rogues pass by, and had them display a message that my pocket had been picked, but nothing and no money was missing.  So maybe the rogue was just jerking your chain a little?
