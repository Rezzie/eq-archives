                                                                                                <b><font size=2>1-31-99</b></font><br>Since I came here and read the editorial about Dwarves, and how the author obviously favors them, I thought I would put a little plug in for us Gnomes too!  I play a Gnome Magician.  I haven't tried any other classes, because I feel I have already found the perfect one, and it is the Gnome.  If you plan on being a magic using class i.e. Necromancer, Magician, etc.  I would highly recommend playing a Gnome.  The gnomes intelligence at it's lowest base starts at 98, and usually 108 for mage types.  The Gnome city of Ak'Anon is a very pleasing sight.  They have automatons running around everywhere, and even the merchants are automatons.  Lost in the Gnome city?  No way!  They have automatons that's only purpose is to be a guide to the places you cant find.  

<p>

Visually the city is stunning, and not to big either, for all you directionally challenged types.  As a Gnome magician I started out with your basic equip, 2 spells, my guild note, my PK note, and my newbie weapon.  I scribed and memorized my spells first thing.  Then headed out the gates to the Steamfont Mountains.  After fighting for about an hour I had level 2, and headed back to sell what I had found on the critters outside Ak'Anon.  I got enough to buy a new spell, summon food, no more worrying about buying food for me!  After another hour I had level 3, and headed back in and got summon dagger, and summon water.  Now, I dont have to worry about food, water, or a weapon.  Even if I die, I can re-supply with food and water, and re-equip myself with a weapon.  How nice! :-)

<p>

When I reached level 3, I found I had a problem.  The things I normally fought did not yield very much experience, while the things the game thinks are a fair fight for me usually send me flying back to the gates.  I was going to have to join a party.  I hooked up with a dwarven cleric who was "visiting" our fine Gnomish city (I think he actually wanted to be a gnome, but that is another storie).  And now we headed out to fight things together.  As a party we did quite well.  Until we ran into a Puma.  Death came quickly that day.  Finally after quite ALOT of fighting I finally reached level 4.  I had been saving all my money for this level because now I could buy a spell that gives me a pet!

<p>

I chose the Fire Elemental and headed back out in front of Ak'Anon.  Summoned a Fire elemental and have been doing quite well since.  It really helps the magic using classes to have a pet to "tank" for you.  Given the Gnomes high intelligence I increased in my skills quite rapidly.  Every other cast of a spell resulted in an improvement in my skill it seemed like.  While I was probably not increasing that fast, the increase was significant.  Well, that's all I really have to say, I just wanted to get a plug in for us Gnomes!  And a few tips if you decide to play a Gnome, Never give a log to the automaton guards, watch out for monsters IN the city, and have a guide show you to the bank, it will save you a few minutes of frustration trying to find it :-)
