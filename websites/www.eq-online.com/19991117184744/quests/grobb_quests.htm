  The guildmaster of the Shadowknights of Nightkeep asks you to go collect bone chips for him.  THis is a good starting quest for SK's.
You can do it at level 1 and you get a rusty 2 handed sword.  There are also some faction adjustments.
<p>
<table bgcolor="#004080" width="100%"><tr><td><font face="helvetica" size="3">Fire Beetle Eyes</font></td></tr></table>
  Talk to one of the Bashers in Grobb, he will ask you to bring him 3 fire beetle eyes, if you bring him 3 eyes he gives you a minor item, sometimes something cool like a 
Brass earring.  You also get a faction adjustement and EXP.

<font face="helvetica" size="2">
  Ranjor the Warrior GM is in search of 1 Froglock meat and 2 Tadpole flesh.  When you get him these items you get a rusty 2 handed battleaxe and some exp.
This is a great starting quest as most items can be found right outside Grobb in the swamp on the Froglock Tad's.  And the Rusty 2 handed axe is great starting weapon
or if you get an extra you can sell it for some gold.

<table bgcolor="#004080" width="100%"><tr><td><font face="helvetica" size="3">Grobb Cleaver Quest</font></td></tr></table>
  This is the quest for the Grobb cleaver, start off by talking to Carver.  He will ask you for 3 pieces of HEHE meat.
And a recipe.  You can buy the meat from Dooga, but trolls are KOS to this merchant or at least I was.  So have a freind buy it for ya.
Then you have to go to Neriak to get the recipe.  Gobbler is the one in Neriak you need to get it from, and he has a quest for you to take some dwarf pickles to 
his freind Nibilik.  The locker that Gobbler gives you has a lock that can be picked cutting the quest short.  If you cant pick it take it out to the Ocean of Tears to the 
Find the small collection of rocks that the Sirens are on and you will find Nibilik, once you give him the locker however he will not give up his recipe.
So kill him and loot it off his corpse, take the meat and the recipe back to Carver and get the <a href="http://eq-online.com/items/magic/m_2handeds.htm">Grobb Cleaver</a>.
<p>
<table bgcolor="#004080" width="100%"><tr><td><font face="helvetica" size="3">Hulkulk's Helm Quest</font></td></tr></table>
  This is a long quest, and you can take some nasty faction hits for it.  I dont think this quest is worth it, but I'll tell ya how to do it anyways.
It starts off at the Shadowknight guild, if you mention the Helm of Hulkulk to Hulkulk he will tell you about his long lost love.
He also asks that you go to Neriak and find out who Lynuga is meeting there, normally you would need to go see her to find out where to go, but skip that and just go to Neriak.
She would tell you that Lumpkin has them and if you ask him he says he gave them to Ratraz.  So skip all that and just go straight to Ratraz who is in the Maidens Fancy.
Kill him, you can either attack in the shop, or, wait till he takes his break.  He is anywhere form 17th to 19th level, and will run if he gets low on health.
You get the happy love bracers from him and his head.  Just destroy the head you dont need it.  Now go to the Foriegn quarter and follow Lumpkin around until he is alone.
When he is alone jump him and kill him, when you get his head, take it and the bracer back to Hulkulk and you will get the <a href="http://eq-online.com/items/magic/head/hoh.htm">Helm of Hulkulk</a>.
