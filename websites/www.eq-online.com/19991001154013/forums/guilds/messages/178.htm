Sadly, Albion now considers the Wolves of Odin enemies.  We will treat the members as hostile. We will grant them no services and offer them no assistance.  Our outstanding /guildwar challenge remains.<p>Our reasons are simple.  A guildmember of theirs led a train onto a party of ours causing two deaths.  Instead of apologising he became abusive and tried to killsteal and deliberately dragged more trains.  When I attempted to contact his guild leaders I was put in contact with the guilds' second-in-command, Vanderben.  <p>Vanderben claimed to be the guild leader and was hardly apologetic.  He was abusive, arrogant and challenging.  He challenged us to war verbally.  We accepted but when I tried to instigate the war with the /guildwar command it turned out he was not the leader.  He told us that the real leader Siegmund was with him RL but when I asked that Siegmund logged on, he refused and became increasingly insulting stating that their preferred tactic would be to 'train us' instead.<p>So the Wolves of Odin refused to accept the official /guildwar challenge despite their earlier taunts and provocation.  The leadership is clearly cowardly, honourless and incapable of acting responsibly regarding the repercussions caused by the actions of their guildmembers.<p>We are aware that the Wolves of Odin recruitment procedure is somewhat open.  They appear to invite anyone interested in joining a guild, therefore by and large many members are innocent and have no idea of the type of guild they are joining.  I would take this opportunity to remind those individuals that they can leave the guild by targetting themselves and typing /guildremove.<p>It is a shame that we must call this guild an enemy and more of a shame that they refuse to accept the /guildwar challenge.<p>Keefer Attaturk,<br>Guildmaster of Albion

: Sadly, Albion now considers the Wolves of Odin enemies.  We will treat the members as hostile. We will grant them no services and offer them no assistance.  Our outstanding /guildwar challenge remains.

: Our reasons are simple.  A guildmember of theirs led a train onto a party of ours causing two deaths.  Instead of apologising he became abusive and tried to killsteal and deliberately dragged more trains.  When I attempted to contact his guild leaders I was put in contact with the guilds' second-in-command, Vanderben.  

: Vanderben claimed to be the guild leader and was hardly apologetic.  He was abusive, arrogant and challenging.  He challenged us to war verbally.  We accepted but when I tried to instigate the war with the /guildwar command it turned out he was not the leader.  He told us that the real leader Siegmund was with him RL but when I asked that Siegmund logged on, he refused and became increasingly insulting stating that their preferred tactic would be to 'train us' instead.

: So the Wolves of Odin refused to accept the official /guildwar challenge despite their earlier taunts and provocation.  The leadership is clearly cowardly, honourless and incapable of acting responsibly regarding the repercussions caused by the actions of their guildmembers.

: We are aware that the Wolves of Odin recruitment procedure is somewhat open.  They appear to invite anyone interested in joining a guild, therefore by and large many members are innocent and have no idea of the type of guild they are joining.  I would take this opportunity to remind those individuals that they can leave the guild by targetting themselves and typing /guildremove.

: It is a shame that we must call this guild an enemy and more of a shame that they refuse to accept the /guildwar challenge.

: Guildmaster of Albion
