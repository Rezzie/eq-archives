: I go to alot of boards everyday because I am a loser with no life =)  But besides that I went to EQVault board and see Enchanters bithcing about how they are so screwed because now some of their spells are resisted by yellows?<br>: Hello?  Where the F*** have you been?  Name one other class that does not have spells resisted by yellows?  And dont even think abuot saying necro's because your dead wrong, + then you might say "Well life tap is never resisted!"  Yeah and it does a whopping 40 something at 16th level.  Big deal.<br>: Cleric can do more than that with a DD spell.  And you wizards that bitch about root being resisted by yellows, give me a break, I can't count how many times one of my spells has been resisted by yellows, evens, and blues!  So WTF do you have to complain about?<p>: Most you damn wizards can drop shit in two spells anyways.<p>: Now magicians have legitimate complaint - their pets are bugged, the research for higher level pets DOES NOT WORK (btw thank you Verant for that) and fixed a magicians pet from running from battles, if you are not familiar with this let me school you on the problem you get into combat and everything is going great and all the sudden your pet bolts.<p>: Just fuckin takes off, leaving you to deal with whatever you were fighting this has been a bug since beta and just now being fixed.  Plus the fact that very often when the pets ran off they found some other shit to attack and went ARGO on something and after whatever it found killed the pet it would come looking for you.<p>: Do us a favor Verant Fix magicians, leave necro's alone (best balanced class of all magic users in my opinion) and dont listen to the childish whining that these wizards and Enchanters who say they characters are useless now.<p>: End Flame...<br>: Nixx =)<p>I dont think you can comment on Enchanters until you have played one our class has been fubar'd.<p>Zin
