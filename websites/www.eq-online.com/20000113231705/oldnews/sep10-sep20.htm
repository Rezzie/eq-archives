Cazic-Thule: CTC Raffle IMPORTANT
 <p>
It has just come to my attention that earlier today someone named Faelen was in the East Commons (at the bazaar) selling raffle tickets which they claimed to be for the CTC Raffle.
THIS IS AND WAS A HOAX. I hope that no one bought tickets from this person as this person does not represent the CTC Raffle and to my knowledge is not planning on holding
any type of raffle but is instead stealing money.
 <p>
Please note that the only people selling tickets for the CTC Raffles will be me, Aracnakat or Delrachnid, the co-owner of the CTC Web Site. If at any time we include others to help with
the raffle, it will be posted at the CTC so you will know beforehand. (CTC = http://www.cazic-thule.com)
 <p>
Also, the CTC Raffle will be scheduled to be held on the first Saturday of every month unless otherwise noted on the site. Therefore the next CTC Raffle will be held Saturday, October
2, 1999.
 <p>
Thanks to everyone and I'm sorry if anyone was ripped off by this Faelen and her hoax. ~Kat

<font size=2 face="helvetica">Cooperative Raid on Neriak
<p>
Word had leaked about an unholy ritual being performed in the bowels of
Neriak last Sunday to learn more about the whereabouts of the fabled
Heartstone. Here is the report from Gance, the guild leader of <a
href="http://members.magnet.at/sam98/index2.html" target="_blank">Legion of
Fyre and Ice</a>:</p><blockquote>It was approximately 12pm Eastern time when
I had arrived with Tegan into Nektulos forest. He had informed me that there
had been a forward scouting party ahead of us. It seems Leeta (of the guild
<a href="http://www.infinicorp.com/WCA/" target="_blank">Wyrm Control</a>)
and Draxa (also of Wyrm Control had already been in scouting out the area
and taking out some guards to make life much easier for us for the upcoming
battle. Gance and Tegan caught up with Leeta and Draxa to help curb the Dark
guards. At the same time Thergrim (of <a
href="http://www.delving.com/grudge.htm" target="_blank">The
Grudgebearers</a>) had contacted Gance and said they would be arriving
shortly. </blockquote><p>Visit the <a

<font size=2 face="helvetica">
Hail the minions of Innoruuk, Rallos Zek, and Cazic Thule! We the
perpetrators of Hate cordially invite all fellow Teir'Dal, Trolls, and Ogres
to spread the Hate, War, and Fear out amongst the Light Dwelling races of
Norrath on the Rallos Zek server.... Starting at 1 pm (central Earth time)
on September 26th.
<p>
A bezerker event will be held to spread the wrath of THE dark gods amongst
the light dwelling races. Teams of dark races will be assembled by the
Bashers before the start of the event. After assembling our might in
Innothule swamp, each contestant team will be given charge to kill as many
light-dwelling PLAYER CHARACTERS as possible between Innothule Swamp and
West FreePort. A referee will be assigned to each group to tally kills. The
team that has the most confirmed kills will receive a hefty reward of 200
plat to be divided equally amongst the winning team members. Looting of ye
slain victims is also allowed so the bounty received has the possibility to
be much greater.
<p>
If interested in attending, email the event coordinator
<a href="mailto:pawnofhate@hotmail.com"> here</a> for Rules of the Event. Due to the limited number of
referees, preference
will be given to those who email early. Please provide your character name.
If you plan on organizing your own team then provide us with your team
members' names. Characters without team members will be assigned one. Max
number of members per team is 5 and max player level is 20.

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Strange ghost ship sighted!</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">This was sent to me today:
<br>
While fighting on Gargoyle island last night on Povar, the ghost ship
"Shark'a Bane" showed up for a short time, along with a water elemental that
was not a true conjured beast (we believe it was controlled by a gm).
Unfortunately, we could not figure out what to do, and soon the ship
disappeared....  To our knowledge, nobody has seen this before....

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Latest Patch Message</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">
September 13th, 9:00am<br>
----------------------<br>
Bug Fixes:<br>
- Players levitating should be easier for other PCs to see.<br>
- When charmed/feared and killed players should not be returned to the character selection screen.<br>
- Lore items in containers that are dropped should not be destroyed.<br>
- Charged items, such as the Staff of the Observers, should correctly report the number of charges remaining after zoning.<br>
- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while looting<br>
- A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.<br>
- A player using online help should no longer be locked into the help screen if another party initiates a trade.<br>
- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if the pc is charmed.<br>
- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck.<br>
<p>
New emotes:<br>
- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree, amaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, bonk, bored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate, cough, cringe, curious, dance, drool, duck, eye, gasp, giggle, glare, grin, groan, grovel, happy, hungry,  introduce, jk (just kidding), kneel, lost, massage, moan, mourn, peer, point, ponder, puzzle, raise, ready, roar, salute, shiver, shrug, sigh, smirk, snarl, snicker, stare, tap, tease, thank, thirsty, veto, welcome, whine, whistle, yawn<br>
<p>
PVP Changes:<br>
- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a 20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon them.<br>
<p>
Spell Changes:<br>
- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect.<br>
- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable.<br>
- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly reduced<br>
- Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into higher level spells.<br>
- Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a level 49 spell)<br>
- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis.<br>
- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.<br>
- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.<br>
- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save - this should stop the 'train' problems that it was causing.<br>
- Gravity Flux will now research correctly for Wizards.<br>
- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers - check your tomes.<br>
- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition are now more easily identifiable.<br>
- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating<br>
- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed.  This means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that it will now stack with the darkness line.<br>
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.<br>
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed - AoE spells will now effect more monsters.<br>
- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items.  Items that have turned lore have had other small benefits added to them.<br>
- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to Conjuration.<br>
- Rangers have gained the spell Dance of the Fireflies (level 15)<br>
- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their effects implemented.<br>
- Magi research components have been added to more monsters throughout the world.<br>
- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt.  Pets default to /pet taunt<br>
- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.<br>
- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br>
- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.<br>
- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have been replaced by new enchantment spells.  These spells have been added to a hidden vendor somewhere in the game.<br>
- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added<br>
<p>
Pets:<br>
- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage<br>
- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better<br>
<p>
DoT Changes:<br>
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell works.<br>
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no change to how a DoT spell works.<br>
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.  <br>
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased.  If the monster moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the DoT as it would before the patch.<br>  If the monster moves for less then 18 seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done before the patch.  If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the fight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch

<font size=3 face="helvetica"><b>Neriak Invasion</b></font><p>
<font size=2 face="helvetica">This was sent to me today:<br>
So... you're level is pretty high now, but lemmie guess, you're getting
bored, right? Sick if squishing frogs and clobbering kobolds, camping paw
of opallo rings again, and you're not insane enough to even hope to go to
the plane of fear till level 85 or so? Good, then I got the event for you! 
NEXT Saturday evening (not this saturday since people are planning to get
killed by Nagfen again :), 9/18, Neriak will fall!! 
<p>
We will gather outside the entrace to the city in Nektulos Forest and at
8PM EST we will storm the gates. The goal? To conquer the Necromancers and
Shadow Knights in the Lodge of the Dead! We will not leave until we have
the whole lodge cleared of every dark hearted inky that lives there (and
then get out quick before they respawn and kill us all :) 
I want people in my army that are brave enough to try. If you are gonna
whine and say it's impossible, then don't go :) It's not impossible at all,
it's no different than killing stuff in Lower Guk or Nagfen's Lair, same
level stuff. Most guards in Neirak start at level 35, merchants that will
attack us anyway even though it's a waste of time to kill em (Wouldn't it
be nice if Verant would make em just not attack at all?), should be around
40, and trainers around 40-50, plus the occasional wandering NPC. 
<p>
What loot is there? Well, I doubt there's anything special besides steel
weapons, but ya never know what, say, the SK trainers will drop cuz I doubt
anyone ever killed em :) But we're not going there for loot, we're going
there for fun! So, if you'd like to come, email me at <a href="mailto:eldrad@timkline.com">eldrad@timkline.com</a>
or find me in game. We need at least 3 full groups of level 35+ people, or
we won't go.. so get your guilds together.. you level 50 guys that are all
camping stuff and playing new characters, this is what ya got level 50 for,
so everyone dust yourselves off and lets go!! :) 
And no, I'm not crazy :)
Thanks!
