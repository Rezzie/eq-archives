<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_the_tribunal.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of The Tribunal seek one thing above all else:

 justice. While some claim to express this desire by

 pursuing careers as guards or magistrates, true believers

 in The Tribunal do not recognize the rights of any court on

 Norrath and enforce the Tribunal's sense of ultimate justice

 on the rest of the population. Retribution, vengeance, and

 punishment are sacred duties. Followers of The Tribunal

 are methodical, patient and just. They must be so, for it is

 their belief that if they punish an innocent, The Tribunal will

 pass judgement against them, and doom them to an

 eternity.
