The reason your skill is not going up is probably because you are not practicing enough. Sometimes I only get 1 point out of 10 tries. It depends what jewels you use. The more expensive jewels tend to increase your skill more, but you receive less success with the more expensive jewels. Also you do not NEED to enchant the metal when you are just practicing your skill, so unless you intend to sell to other players, don't use enchant silver. Also another hint, selling prices for magic jewellry should be COST to make X2, plus a plat or two if it is in high demand.
