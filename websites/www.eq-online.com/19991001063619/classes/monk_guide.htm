The numbers in Green are the primary stats for this class. These are the stats that are suggested you increase, which are the relative stats for the Monk class. Strength is for the extra power of your martial art attacks, and will also determine the amount of weight that you are able to carry. Stamina reflects your constitution, which is used in calculating your hit points, and also for the amount of strenuous tasks that you can perform without becoming exhausted. Dexterity and Agility both affect your natural ability to dodge attacks and raise your natural armour class.
<p>
Deities

Monks only have two choices, one being Agnostic, the other being Quellious the Tranquil. There is little evidence at the moment to favour one choice over the other, but the choice does effect your starting position, Agnostic in Qeynos and Quellious in Freeport.
<p>
Skills for the Monk Class

The following skills for the Monk are mostly combat orientated, but by no means are you a ‘stand in’ warrior, you are an exceptional fighter in your own right, having fast attacks, and because of your natural Armour Class, the least chance of being hit yourself.
<ul>
<li>Bind Wound</li><br>
The ability of using a bandage on yourself/another person to aid in healing.
<p>
<li>Dodge</li><br>
The ability to Dodge blows in combat, this is an automatic skill, which is automatically checked when you are in combat.
<p>
<li>Dual Wield</li><br>
An attack from your secondary hand (as long as its empty). This is another automatic skill.
<p>
<li>Hand to Hand</li><br>
Martial art attack using your hands.
<p>
<li>Kick</li><br>
Martial art attack using your feet.
<p>
<li>Mend</li><br>
A self-healing technique. A good place to put plenty of practice points into.
<p>
<li>One Hand Blunt</li><br>
The Skill for use with Maces and Clubs.
<p>
<li>Throwing</li><br>
The skill for use with throwing stars and thrown axes.
<p>
<li>Two Handed Blunt</li><br>
The skill for use with large blunt weapons, i.e. Great Staff and Two Handed Hammer.
<p>
</ul>
Specific Monk Skills<br>

These skills are available for you to train in once you achieve the required level (shown in brackets.) You must spend at least one point in each to ‘learn’ them. Do not assume that because you are now 5th Level you know Safe Fall and Round Kick when you have spent all of your practice points in Alcohol Tolerance to impress your drinking friends.
<p>
Safe Fall (3)
Allows you to drop from heights with little or no damage.
<p>
Round Kick (5)
A Monk special attack, supposedly magical in nature (which also looks rather impressive.) It is slower than your punches, but does roughly the same damage.
<p>
Sneak (8)
Sneak past NPC’s and Monsters.
<p>
Tiger Claw (10) 
Another attack, about the same damage as a round kick, but recycles faster.
<p>
Block (12) 
An automatic skill similar to dodge.
<p>
Double Attack (15)
Allows you to have two attacks per round. Whether this means its possible to get four attacks if your Dual Wield is good enough….=o)
<p>

Feign Death (17)
The supposedly best skill - ideal for sudden large monster spawns, Trains, or just out gunned in combat, drop to the floor, rest till full health and then be on your merry way.
<p>
Eagle Strike (20)
An advanced combat attack.
<p>
Dragon Punch (25)
As above, possibly more damage.
<p>
Disarm (27)
To disarm an attacking opponent
<p>
Flying Kick (30)
Our best attack, being able to do upwards of 70 points of damage.
<p>
Riposte (35)
Attacking in response of being hit, or turning an opponents attack against them. Possibly an automatic skill.
<p>
Tips for the beginning
<p>
These ‘rules’ apply throughout your career as a Monk:
<br>
Click on Sense Heading often - it does get tedious, but you’ll be grateful when you’ve been turned around in a fight or you’re trying to retrieve your corpse.
<p>
Click on Mend, all the time. It takes about five minutes (real time) to cycle, but will soon advance. Beware - sometimes this can worsen your wounds, although I haven’t killed myself yet.
<p>
Use your practice points wisely  - Don’t lump them all into Hand to Hand, combat skills advance very well on their own. And there are level caps - Hand to Hand will not advance past 30 at level 5. Instead use them for things like Mend, or one of the Trades (i.e. Tailoring or Smithing,) as these do not advance so quickly.
<p>
Your Offense and Defense skills increase your natural Attack and Armour class, which are again capped at about 5 points/level.
<P>
Do not worry about weapons of any description, as your hands and feet are very efficient, and get a fire beetle eye to use as a light source in your pack (not in your hand) because this allows your Dual Wield skill to advance.
<P>



As with most characters, the first three levels should be spent in the newbie zones outside of your starting city, obtaining experience and cash along the way. Do not worry too much about dying at the moment, you are not penalised yet. Your first quest (other than handing in your note and receiving your tunic) is easily found in the Guild house, just ask around noting any [keywords]. Make sure you buy a backpack first, this will allow you to carry more stuff - making trips backwards and forwards to the shop less frequent.
<p>

For Levels 4-5, you can be brave and adventure into the East Commonlands (but stay near the zone or up to the first Inn) and again slowly build that experience. You should now have some cloth armour, your backpack and some spare cash, so start asking around if anyone has patchwork armour for sale. A couple of times I was in the right place at the right time for people auctioning armour and rings, all of which are helpful.
<P>
For the 6th to 7th levels, I decided to practice a lot with the Tailoring skill, so ultimately I could kit myself and my friend (Doyle) with homemade armour. Starting with Black bears and Wolves (not Kodiacks!!!!), you are not only gaining experience, but learning your Tailoring with their pelts. Once you are brave enough either to solo or group, take on some Puma’s, which will supply you with Human sized armour. Later on you could try Lioness’s and Lion’s, but I personally would leave that until later levels (or bigger groups.) 
<P>
I know this is obvious, but try not to get yourself killed now - avoid unnecessary risks, as at 6th level you begin to lose experience when you are killed, and it is possible to lose a level because of this. So avoid taking on that (/con white) Puma near the sand dunes at the second Inn, when its kin are probably just around the corner, (even Skeletons have habits of jumping in when you least expect it,) and watch out for the Griffins!
<P>

The following recommendations are taken from numerous sources, as I have not personally got beyond 7th level (yet.) Thanks to all the Monks out there, and may you be blessed accordingly - Bodi.
<P>
Save practice points for Feign Death at 17th level. (I intend to dump about 20-25 points when and if I get there.)
<P>
Add points to Mend - at higher levels you can heal 2/5th ‘s of your hit points, or 120 out of 300!
<P>
Watch your encumbrance, the more you carry, the lower your Armour class becomes (after about 15 Kgs)
