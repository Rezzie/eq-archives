<center><b><font face="helvetica" size="3">Skills for the Paladin Class</font></b></center>

<p>

The Paladin has a wide range of skills, most deal with inflicting damage on their opponents, and they also gain spell ability at Level 9.  Here is a list of the skills a Paladin gets 

and the level (if applicable) that the Paladin can learn them.  Paladins start with the Lay on Hands skill.

<p>

<ul>

<li><b>One handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in one handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as the mace, club, etc.

<p>

<li><b>One handed slash</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in one handed slashing weapons.  Weapons such as Battle axe, Long Sword, BroadSword, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Two handed blunt</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in two handed blunt weapons.  Weapons such as Great staff, two-handed hammer, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Two handed slash</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in two handed slash weapons.  Weapons such as two handed sword, two handed scythe, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Defense</b></li>

<br>

This is your natural defense, your skill at avoiding blows this skill combines with Dodge to boost your overall defense against 

attacks.  This skill when improved slightly increases your Armor Class.  Note that this is your "natural" armor class, thus if you 

were to not wear armor, this would not lower the bonus provdided by this skill.

<p>

<li><b>Hand-to-Hand</b></li>

<br>

Hand-to-Hand combat is fighting with no weapon.  Bards will utilize this if they are using an instrument in 

one oe both hands and need to fight.

<p>

<li><b>Offense</b></li>

<br>

Like Defense, this skill raises your "natural" offensivness, meaning it raises your attack number and this bonus would still 

be there if you unequiped whatever weapon you are using.

<p>

<li><b>Piercing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in piercing weapons.  Weapons such as Spear, Dagger, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Sense Heading</b></li>

<br>

This skill allows you to sense which direction you are heading.

<p>

<li><b>Archer</b></li>

<br>

Proficiency in the use of Missile weapons such as bows, and arrows.

<p>

<li><b>Swimming</b></li>

<br>

This is your ability to swim and to hold your breath for longer periods of time.

<p>

<li><b>Throwing</b></li>

<br>

This is your skill in thrown weapons.  Weapons such as Throwing axe, Shuriken, etc.

<p>

<li><b>Fishing</b></li>

<br>

Your skill in fishing determines how many failures you have before actually catching a fish, it also should help 

you avoid breaking your fishing pole.

<p>

<li><b>Baking</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to bake things.

<p>

<li><b>Tailoring</b></li>

<br>

Very useful for a beginning bard, you can take wolf pelts and make patchwork armor out of them.

Patchwork is almost as good as leather, and if you get a blacksmith you can also add studs to your 

patchwork armor making Studded leather.

<p>

<li><b>Smithing</b></li>

<br>

As mentioned above this is your ability to shape steel or other metals into useful objects, like lantern cases, 

studs for leather armor, even metal armor.

<p>

<br>

Your ability to brew alcoholic beverages, yeah!!

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol Tolerance</b></li>

<br>

Your ability to avoid adverse affects of alcohol.

<p>

<li><b>Beg</b></li>

<br>

This is a skill all races get, use this with extreme caution NPC's will kill you if you beg from them to much, 

or some if you beg from them at all!  So use this cautiuosly, I have heard reports of NPC's giving away some very cool 

things as a result of begging though.

<p> 

<li><b>Jewelcraft</b></li>

<br>

Not much is known about this skill, make jewelry from rocks?  No one knows, if you do find out 

let us know :)
