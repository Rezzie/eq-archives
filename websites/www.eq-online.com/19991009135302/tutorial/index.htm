<p>
When you first enter Everquest the first screen you see after passing all the initial log in stuff is the Character creation screen.  To begin from here click on one of the <i>Create New Character</i> buttons.  This will take you to the Character generation screen.  In this screen you will see the Races on the left and the stats and available classes on the right.  Here is a brief rundown of what the different stats do in the game:
<p>
<b><font color="red">Strength:</font></b><br>
This is the physical power of the character.  It determines how much the character can carry without being encumbered and is figured into the character's ability to do damage to an opponent in melee.
<p>
<b><font color="red">Stamina:</font></b><br>	
This is your health and constitution.  It reflects your ability to perform strenuous tasks without becoming exhausted.  It is also used in calculating your hit points.
<p>
<b><font color="red">Agility:</font></b><br>	
This is your physical dexterity and is used to determine your defensive abilities.  The higher your Agility, the less likely you are to be hit by melee combat.
<p>
<b><font color="red">Dexterity:</font></b><br>	
This is your hand/eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and spell casting capability.  This is used in calculating your missile combat skills and aids in determining if you are interrupted when you are hit while casting a spell.
<p>
<b><font color="red">Wisdom:</font></b><br>		
This is willpower and faith and is used to determine the casting abilities of Shaman, Druids, Rangers, Clerics, and Paladins.  It is also involved in resisting magical spells that effect the mind.
<p>
<b><font color="red">Intelligence:</font></b><br>	
This is intellect and is used to determine the casting abilities of Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Bards.
<p>
<b><font color="red">Charisma:</font></b><br>	
This is a combination of the physical beauty and charm of the character and is used primarily to calculate how various NPC factions react to the character.  The higher the charisma, the less likely they will be adversely effected by actions that will lower the characters standing with a group, though this modification is very limited (i.e. a pretty and charming murderer is still a murderer).  Charisma also can cause merchants to alter their pricing to the character, again depending upon the character's standing in the merchant's faction.
<p>
You will notice some of the stats colored green, these are the stats that the game recommends you increase based on your class.  It is completely up to you, but it is a good idea to up those.
<p>
Once you character is rolled you have the choice of either picking a name or having the <i>Random Name Generator</i> pick one for you.  Since the name must be approved by the server it is a good idea to keep trying if you dont get the one you want, or just give up and have the name generator get you one :)
<p>
After name generation you can choose a different face for your character if you dont like the one he/she has now.  Do this by clicking on the face button and scrolling through the choices.
<p>
After this process you hit next and are taken to the Deities selection screen, deities allowed to your race/class appear as buttons that you can choose, those that are not are greyed out.  Choose a deitie and then hit next.  The Deities when chosen also give you a brief summary of the deity and his followers.
<p>
After the deity selection is done you are presented with a screen that tells you overall based on race, class, deity how hard your character is going to be to play.  It ranges from Low difficulty to High Difficulty.
<p>
The next screen is the Starting point, this can vary based on Race, Class, and Deity chosen.  Usually you are only presented with one option.  You hit next when your starting point is selected and the server goes through the task of "approving" your name.  If all goes well you are returned to the first screen with the character buttons, and your new character appears in the first empty slot.  Now click your characters name, and hit the Enter World button.

<img height=47 width=91 align="left" src="spell_button_tutorial.jpg">Lets say your first character is a magic using class or cleric.  The first thing you want to do after you get into the game is scribe your spells, to do this click on the spells button.
<p><p>
<center>This will then give you the screen you see below:</center>
<p>
<center><img height=309 width=394 src="spell_book_guide.jpg"></center>
<p>
<OL TYPE=>
<LI>This is the bar that shows your progress when you scribe a spell into your spellbook.  It will tick down until you get the message <i>You have finished scribing (spellname)</i><br>
<LI>This is similar to the scribing bar but this one ticks down when you memorize a spell.<br>
<LI>This is the meditate button, after you get the meditate skill you can click on this to speed up the scribing and memorizing process.<br>
<LI>This is an empty slot where you put the spells you want to scribe, more on this below.<br>
<LI>This is a scribed spell in your spellbook, from here you can memorize it.<br>
</OL>
<p>
<center><font face="helvetica" size="3"><b>How to scribe and memorize</b></font></center>
<p>
<font face="helvetica" size="2">
To scribe a spell click on it in your inventory, this "picks up" the scroll and then move it to an empty slot in your spellbook.  The ticker mentioned before will tick down until it is scribed.  Once it is scribed an icon for the spell will appear in the spell book.  From here you can memorize it.
<p><font face="helvetica" size="2">
Now you can click on the spell icon in your spellbook and drag it over to an empty slot in your available spells area.
<font face="helvetica" size="2">
<p><p>After you click on the spell icon in your book it "picks up" the spell and you see a octagonal button, drag that over to the empty space in your memorized spells list on the left and click once.  The memorize ticker will tick down until you have succesfully memorized the spell.  Now all you have to do to cast it is click on the icon.

<center><font face="helvetica" size="3"><b>How to setup up hotkeys</b></font></center>
<p>
Thats really all there is to memorizing and scribing spells.  Additionally you can use hotkeys to cast spells.  To set up a hotkey, do this:
<p>
Put the mouse over a memorized spell icon and hold down the left mouse button you will hear two clicks until the spell turns into a button shaped icon.  Once this is attached to the mouse, drag it down to the hotkey area and click on an empty spot.
<table width=100% cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td>
<center><img height=62 width=85 src="pick_spell_tutorial.jpg"><img  height=158 width=116 src="pick_spell_tutorial2.jpg"><img  height=158 width=116 src="pick_spell_tutorial3.jpg"></center></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
You can also set hotkeys for actions and skills.  We will use the anonymous button and make a hotkey for that.  Here is how you do it:
<p>
Like the spells you click on the action you want to hotkey and hold down the mouse button a large version of the button will appear, drag it to an empty spot and click, this will put the button down in the hotkey area.
<p>
<table width=100% cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" border="0">
<tr>
<td>
<center><img height=144 width=111 src="pick_button_tutorial.jpg"><img height=144 width=106 src="pick_button_tutorial2.jpg"><img height=169 width=108 src="pick_button_tutorial3.jpg"><img height=169 width=104 src="pick_button_tutorial4.jpg"></center></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The hotkey pad is designed to let you hot key actions normally requiring a mouse click.  Below is a diagram of which keys activate the items in the hotkey pad.

The main screen of Everquest can be a little confusing, we have added a screenshot below and will describe the various options on that screen
