<font size=2 face="helvetica">
ATTENTION FELLOW INHABITANTS OF NORRATH!!!
 <p>
I, Drelmo of the Xegony server am on the verge of releasing the latest EQ utility for players everywhere. This program allows you to look at all your EQ screenshots at the
click of a button. As if that weren't enough it can look at ANY image on your entire harddrive. And it all requires no effort. Just boot up the program, choose the directory
in which your pictures are (you can change this directory at any time just by clicking, no typing involved) and then browse through the list of pictures that appears. It's as
easy as pie!
 <p>
Some of you may have EIB 4.x and use the program quite frequently. I agree whole heartedly that the 4.x series has many many holes in it. That is why I have looked at
every detail, every one of those hundreds of e-mails and in-game tells and made 5.0 everything you could possibly want out of an image browser. Some new features in
the program include:
<p>
          - Color Schemes<br>
          - Extra applications when in the EQ mode (including Mana Calculator, EQ Spells, and possibly the Weapon Dmg Calculator)<br>
          - Scroll bars to look at all those 1024X768 pictures that you get off EQ Vault.<br>
          - Image Information displaying the image size in pixels.<br>
          - Many many more mini features included...<br>
<p>
As Elmo's Image Browser 5.0 nears the ending of BETA, the final code is being put in. Now, the official release date is the 20th of October. That's the coming
Wednesday. On that date, you will be able to download the latest program to help enhance your EQ experience. All you'll have to do is go to www.drelmo.net, click on
the Elmo's Multimedia picture, and there will be a link to the download. All this available starting the 20th of October.
