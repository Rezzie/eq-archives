<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_rodcet_nife.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Rodcet Nife take a solemn oath to fight

 disease and death until one or the other finally claims

 them. They are very generous and humble, asking little

 more than the recipients of aid from them pass their

 kindness onto another. They are not content to deal with

 the effects of disease and death after they occur and

 vigorously seek to destroy the sources of these evils.

 Healers and mystics are typical followers but many noble

 rangers and paladins also have also taken the Nife Oath.

 They believe that, through faith in The Prime Healer, the

 wounded heart of the universe shall one day be mended

 and death's dark shadow will never be seen again.
