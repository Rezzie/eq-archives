Greetings fellow Rodcet Nife roleplayers<br>I am Lozur , currently in the 6th circle of Necromancy as a dark elf , and reside in Neriak on the server of Rodcet Nife ( although I have ventured to Freeport to the dismay of a few young paladin scum ;) ). My fellow dark elf , Brorna,  and I , have began a website for all Rodcet Nife players to meet and exchange news and events - http://www.rodcetnife.com . We hope to help make a strong community of roleplayers on this server and will post any nws , events , etc on our site . Also is a special section for our new guild, House Malla Phalar (means Honored Grave in dark elven) which is forming up nicely and should be official soon so if you want to be one of the original founding members email me or Brorna an let us know . It is open to all truly evil characters as we thought it would be interesting and useful to adopt some non-dark elfs into our family if they have accepted the path of evil . So check our site out if interested in joining or just to help get the Rodcet Nife server going on the right path. Lastly please the realize the site is brand new and we are working on getting it looking better each day. <br>Thanks<br>
