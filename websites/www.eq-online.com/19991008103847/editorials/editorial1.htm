&nbsp;Hello all, My name is Banshee (that is actually the name I go by in online games).  Being an avid fan of many MUD's (Multi User Dungeons) and Graphical MUD's I nearly fell out of my chair when I saw Everquests homepage.  This looked to be the ultimate gaming experience that I had seen to date.  I have played many online RPG type games such as Meridian 59, Ultima Online, Realms, NWN (for those that remember that), to name a few.  One thing these games all shared was certain player related issue's that never got resolved, and also a few of them experienced guide corruption.  That being a topic that is to lengthy to go into here.  As far as the PK (player killer) issue goes it seems 989 has come up with a great resolution to that little problem.  
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact I won't be talking about the Player Killer issue at all in this editorial, that subject has been hashed out way to many times.  Safe to say though that 989 is working on the PVP system as we speak.  And the problems that plagued other games as far as pk'ing goes will probably never exist in Everquest, I hope.  When I first saw the Everquest website I immediately went to the screenshots section (I'll admit it I love eye candy, and the more in a game the better I say!).  And Everquest was loaded with it.  When I first actually saw the game about a day ago, I was very impressed.  The hills, tree's, grass, water, everything looks so great!  The tester I was watching was running through a forest at night, and the lighting effects are so life-like that you actually <i>feel</i> like you are in a forest at night.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The height difference is scaled very well indeed.  When you run up to attack a Giant, you are actually attacking his foot, or shin, depending on how tall you are and how tall he is, they come in different sizes.  The landscape is gorgeous.  The sky is very beautiful, rolling clouds, sunsets, and thunderstorms.  The water is truly transparent, when you are underneath it you can look up out of it, and if you are above it you can look down into it and see what might be swimming around.  The spellcasting in the game is visually appealing.  I must applaud 989 for there work on the spellcasters and making every spell unique in its graphics and animated sequences.  I am a very hard critic of games, I look for problems, and even while Everquest is still in beta.  I am amazed at how visually stunning the game is.  Oh, I know what your saying now, all she cares about is graphics, what about the gameplay, roleplaying, and mechanics?  Well, you'll need to wait for the next editorial for the 


game, it will be more in depth as far as how the game is played.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For now let me leave you with this, the game is the closest thing to a graphical Dungeons and Dragons that this author has ever seen.  This is the game I have been waiting years to play, if it meets my expectations I am sure it will meet yours.  And yes it is worth every minute of the wait....
