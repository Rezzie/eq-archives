People of Virtue<p>I am currently looking for any and all people to join and help me make a guild possible.  Its for all races, PvP, and classes. I want to make this guild for PvP's to join, because I dont think we give them a chance. I myself isnt a PvP, and never will be at this time being, but I just think PvP's should be treated like everyone else, same with the evil based races.  If someone wants to play like this, they should beable to without having people gaining up on them, and not letting them into a guild.  I know there must be some guilds with PvP in them, and I just would like to be one of the (probably) few.  Just thought to say what I think.  But anyways back to the guild. Please reply to this, on the message board, and give me a reply in email also.  Please no ICQ, until I get you into guild, if your still wanting to, when there is nine people. I will only reply to nine people, if there is more then nine, I'll just let the extra's that I already got the nine I need.  The nine people will be officers, and my lowest title, then when you get more people into the guild, will I let you go up to another rank.. I just have the officers being a no title thing, and letting them earn their ranking a little bit different then the non-officers will be. Probably by now, no one will want to join my guild, but oh will,  live is unfair. Please also go to my website, check out my titles and such, and sign the guestbook.  And finally the below information is my charter:<p>Charter: This is a guild for all PvP's, races and classes of the server Povar.  Everyone may join. Everyone is treated with kindness, and respect from me, and hopefully by everyone that joins. We will join up, and go hunting, share loot, and such.  You will be able to gain titles, and also lose titles, as I see fit.. To gain titles, you must dual someone your level, and class (example: a lvl 1 warrior V.S. a lvl 1 warrior). All officers will be given the lowest title, and will earn by getting members into the guild, and I'll let officers know how many they have to get in (cant do by message board, unless I say so), but will be still known as an officer, but with two titles (a getting people into guild title, and a title given by the Guildmistress).<p><br>Thank you,<p>Mataki (Ma-ta-ki, or Mat-a-ki)<br>Human, Warrior<br>Level 8<br>Hometown is Freeport<br>http://members.tripod.com/PoV_1/index.html<br>E-mail: mataki_1@yahoo.com/ICQ: 18166335
