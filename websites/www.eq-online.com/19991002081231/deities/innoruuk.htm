<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=254 SRC="d_innoruuk.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire Dark Elven

 race who regard him as their "Father." They believe that

 Hate is a creative force, or rather "THE" creative force in

 the universe. Creativity born of destruction. Love and

 kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what

 they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to

 obtain it. It is only through the total disdain of your

 enemies that you can gain true power over them. Pity and

 mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and

 viciousness. It is the honest belief of the followers of

 Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they could

 destroy all of Norrath.
