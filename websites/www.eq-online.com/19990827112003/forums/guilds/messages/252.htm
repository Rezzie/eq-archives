: Fellow Citizen's of Norrath. I have come to invite you to join me in creating The Vigilantes on the Rallos Zek Server. The Dedication of this guild is to stop Pkers. We'll not interupt Pkers that only do so at appropriate times. We will, however, do our best to stop Pkers that have gone over the edge by killing players that are looting or are already in Battle. I accept All races and all classes. Whether your a Human Warrior, or a Dark Elf Necromancer, I'll accept you if you devote yourself to never Pk another player unless it is in self defense, or it's too fullfill our guilds goal. If Interested, contact me, Elyham, or Kadaen in the game.<p><p><br>Too bad it will never happen.YOU ARE TO WEAK TO STOP US BWHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHH!<br>
