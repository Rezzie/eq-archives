I am still looking for charter members. I said before that I only wanted Clerics for charter members. Well I have come to find out that it is not enough. I have opend the requirements for charter and regular members are now Clerics, Druids, Paladins and Shamans. So if you are interested click on the link below and decided if you would like to help get the guild off the ground floor and onto the server.  I am currently only going to be on the E'ci server and may migrate to the others if the interest arises.<p>Krion - Dwarvern Cleric
