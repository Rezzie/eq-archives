<p><font size=3><b>Spell info</b></font><br>We're now looking for good descriptions of spell effects and damage that they do if applicable, to complete our spells section.  Mail any info relevant to <a href="mailto:arkblade@eq-online.com">Arkblade</a>.
<p><font size=3><b>Everworld.net is having a contest!</b></font><br>Everworld is having 2 contests for some extra phase 4 accounts that people have sent in.   One is the ol'  "What would you do for the phase 4 account" contest the other is the Funniest fake EQ screenshot contest.   
<p><font size=3><b>Latest Everquest Patch info</b></font><br>The last Everquest patch fixed quite a few things, here's some highlights of the patch:<br>
<ul>
<li>Client side bugs, including several lockups and crashes.</li>
<br>
<li>Boats - Boats should be very stable now. Enjoy sailing!!</li>
<br>
<li>Targeting - We have made MAJOR improvements to the targeting routines. Try
them out and tell us what you think.</li>
<br>
<li>You should no longer lose your Newbie Guild Tunic upon death.</li>

<li>The chat server is now optional.</li>

<p><font size=3><b>Planned Updates</b></font><br>Here's what we plan to update by the weekend.  We want to redo the spells page, and skills page, the skills page is way outdated and needs a change :)  We also want to get race specific info, and start on the Beastiary and add a few more player guides.

<font size=3><b>3DGaming world reveiw of Everquest</b></font><br>
Rick at 3Dgaming sent us this:
<p>
While braving a strange new world and meeting many interesting people, 3DGN
has explored role playing as never before by dying many interesting deaths
to cute woodland creatures, angry rocks, and what we thought were
shrubberies. We have a comprehensive new look at the world of Norrath with
the lowdown on all the races and classes available, as well as exclusive,
never before seen screenshots, in our preview of EverQuest.

<font size=3><b>Request from Everworld.net</b></font><br>We've had a request from Everworld.net to post up some links for you and they are:
<p>

<a href="http://eqlist.listbot.com">EverQuest General Discussion List</a> - This list is for general EverQuest discussion, whatever doesn't fit into the
categories of the other lists.

<p>
<a href="http://eqannounce.listbot.com">EverQuest Bulletin Announcement List</a> - This list is for news announcements and other such important
bulletins. This is an announcement list, and as such will only contain bulletins sent out by the administrators.
You won't be flooded with all the news, but important things, like EQ going gold, would have been sent to this
list.
<p>

<a href="http://eqguilds.listbot.com">Everquest Guild Discussion List</a> - Alliances, recruiting, discussion, you name it. If it's about EQ guilds, it should
go on this list.
<p>

<a href="http://eqpvp.listbot.com">EverQuest PVP Discusion List</a> - Trash talk, discussion, challenges, threats, asassination requests, all of this
goes to the PVP list. Be forewarned, I fully expect there to be a lot of hostility on this list, with the trash talk
being allowed and all. Gotta have some kinda outlet for aggression!
<p><font size=3><b>Submitted Information</b></font><br>We've received quite a bit of information from you guys out there, keep it coming!  We are going to be getting the Beastiary up soon, and equipment guides should be up soon as well.  They just added what we hope will be the last of the trade skill items.  We'll see...that's the joy of Beta hehe.

<font size=3><b>EQO Looking for info!</b></font><br>With the loss of some staff members here Daknor and I have been very busy trying to get you as much info as possible and 
Daknor has been good about answering questions on the general board.  We are looking for a few people to supplie us with the following:
<ul>
<li>Class guides and tips</li>
<br>We have the Paladin and Rogue guides done, all except for tips, I have not actually played a rogue or paladin and are looking for anyone who has to submit us info on how you 
started the character or any tips you can give us, this would apply to all classes.
<p>
<li>Maps</li>
<br>Always looking for maps.
<p>
<li>Stories, Tips, Editorials, and Quests</li>
<br>compeleted a quest?  What did you get for doing it?  How did you get the quest?  Stuff like this is what we are looking for.
<p>
<li>Equipment</li>
<br>With Everquest changing as much as it does, this can be a hard area to keep updated, we have lists of the statistics of the equipment, and are looking for graphics for them.
or any info on equipment you can send us.
<p>
<li>Beasts</li>
<br>Info on beasties, loot dropped, where to find them, maybe even what level you need to be to take them on.
<p>
</ul>
If you would like to submit any info on these subjects mail it to <a href="mailto:arkblade@eq-online.com">Arkblade</a> any relevant info will be posted and credit will be given to whoever gets us the info.
We dont usually like asking for player submitted content, but due to reductions in our staff we could use some :)

</table><br><font size=3><b>Phase 4 players banned</b></font><br>A few players were banned last night for their exploitation of certain mobs and taking advantage of something on the +PVP server.  They apparently were warned numerous times.  This brings up a good point, there are not a whole lot (at least from what I have seen) ways to exploit things in the game, but if you find one and use it and the GM's catch you, you more than likely will get a warning, after which if you continue to abuse the exploit will be banned.  Everquest doesnt mess around when it comes to an exploit.<p><font size=3><b>Electronics Boutique</b></font><br>Everquest for 39.95, and the hint book for a little extra, go <a href="http://www.ebworld.com">here</a> to find out about their special offer for ordering the Everquest retail product.

there to do the same.  We replaced their link with some other great sites such as EQBoard,EQSS, XRGN, NotCrazy, and Everworld.net, between us six, you should
never be wondering about EQ :)<p><font size=3><b>Server status so far</b></font><br>The servers have become much more stable
since the 10th of February when phase 4 started.  I have noticed 1000+ ppl on each server with ease.  Where as before this was more 
of a problem.<p><font size=3><b>Trade Skills</b></font><br>The Trade skills are now in the game, they added the items you need to use these skills 
to the merchants in the game.  They are still "tweaking" this part of the game slightly, but we should have a list up soon on what they do and 
how to use them.<p><font size=3><b>Note about factions</b></font><br>Factions were being debugged in the 3rd phase of Beta.  When 
you killed certain creatures you would receive a faction "hit"  making you popular with one group, and hated by another or others.  This whole process is
still somewhat of a mystery, know one really knows how this affects the game yet.  But they are no longer giving you faction messages when killing these creatures, 
we will see how this is implemented in the final and then decide whether anything will go up under the Faction guide, lacking the info might not allow us to 
complete this section.  If that is the case it will be removed<p><font size=3><b>EQ Interactive Tutorial</b></font><br>Verant added a program called tutorial.exe to the 
patches about a week or so ago I think, we checked out this tutorial and it is really cool, hope it makes it into the final, but we will also provide a tutorial here, on our site.

Anything (usually) submitted to us is posted, and we also take the time to answer players questions, as we have said before, we are here for the players of EQ.  We don't know what the hell EQVaults problem is but we wont be contacting them about anything in the future.

If you did not get one send mail to me NOW!  We will check our database for your name and get one out to you if you did send us mail.  Winners chosen Friday the 19th, around 5pm PST!!!<p><font size=3><b>About Updates Please read this</b></font><br>Ok, we have received alot of mail from ppl asking us to post certain things.  Here is where we are at right now folks.  This game keeps changing, we were compiling a large bit of info that ended up being scrapped because they changed it.  To keep this from happening to us again, we are going to focus on Characters/Races/Classes.  The City guides are on HOLD!  Maps will come with the retail product.  And we will wait to see how good they are before continuing the maps section.  Factions are almost impossible guage now.  When they were debugging the faction part of the game 


you could see which monsters killed gave you faction hits.
<p>
We have a list somewhere that we will try to put up if we can, it may lack accuracy.  This game is very hard, especially right now to report on, it changes so much, so fast that it is hard to update with accurate information.  And that is exactly what we want is accurate info.  So for now we will concentrate on Classes, having a Bard, Warrior, and Magician guide going up very soon!  And races/character creation coming shortly after, they dont seem to "tweak" characters as much as they do the rest of the game, so bear with us :)

<font size=3><b>Server issues addressed</b></font><br>Here's a brief update of where we are at:
<p>
1) Chat/ Login Server - We've basically got it stabalized. Early next week you WILL see the front end go directly to the
Server Selection Screen, and there will be a chat option on that page. We had intended this all along, but for now, we needed
to load test it AND make sure that we are seeing the problems that are occuring with people trying to get in.
<p>
2) Problems with people who can't get into the chat server - We are seeing an isolated problem with some people who get a
Black Screen upon logging in. We are looing into it, and we have some ideas.
<p>
3) Problems with people locking up on the Loading Screen (Elf woman with the scenes behind her). - This sometimes occurs
when a person get's kicked out of a zone because it crashes, or other reasons. We are debugging this problem.
<p>
4) Problems with people locking at the character selection screen - this is a pretty rare problem. A couple of notes - If you
are running a Monster Fusion - MAKE SURE you have the latest drivers. The older drivers have this problem, the current
ones don't. If you don't have this card, make sure you have the latest drivers for your card. We are still looking closely at this
problem.
<p>
5) Sound Problems - We are aware of a sound crash bug - If this happens to you often, disable your sound card for the time
being, but we should have this fixed really soon. This should be a pretty uncommon problem.
<p>
6) Server Stability - We are working on several bugs in this area. We've fixed many already. 
<p>
Overall, we are seeing things at a relatively stable place, with a few exceptions. The login/chat server problems we had early
on were expected since we didn't have the load on them to test before. We are fixing the bugs as rapidly as we can and we
will continue to do so.
<p>
One last thing I want to mention is the restoration of characters. This is progressing as FAST as it possibly can. We have
decided that resources are also needed to deal with tech support issues, so things are going a little slower then we would like.
Please be patient.

Yours truly has been in for a day now hehe :)  And that is why there has been no update for 2-11.  Sorry about that, I am hooked on EQ already.
What do we have for you so far?  Well we are compiling a rather sizeable amount of information with new information coming in all the time.  What you can expect here by tommorow or the next day is:<br>
<ul>
<li>Starting skills for Classes</li><br>
<li>Starting spells</li><br>
<li>Screenshots!!!</li><br>
<li>Neriak guide (pending)</li>

And more as we get it :)  Have fun all I am headed back into the game!  See you in Norrath!!<p>
<font size=3><b>In the know..</b></font><br>I sent mail to Verants John Smedley, volunteering our site as a source of information and a resource for Verant to use.  He replied and we hope to be hearing more things from him if there are more major problems, and will then post any
pertinent info up here on the page.<p><font size=3><b>What you might not see here....</b></font><br>As you know, Everquest is a HUGE game.  The world and NPC's are numerous.  Due to the game still being in beta, and the fact that they are still changing things we will only update you with the info that is solid.  An example of this is items.  Item prices vary depending on your Charisma and the NPC's general attitude towards you.
Also, what a merchant sells, his actual list of items changes.  We had someone in the game who wanted a shield and found a merchant who sold one, after he had the cash to buy it, he went back and the merchant no longer was selling shields.  We are not sure if this is part of beta or how it will be in the final too.  So we wont list merchants items, until we know, any other information
that is similar to this, things that are not the same everytime, or that change randomly, will not be documented here until we can validate them.	We don't want to mis-inform anyone :)

The EQO staff is made up of gamers, and mostly fantasy/role playing gamers at that.  Curren
tly we have 6 people on our staff.  Let me introduce them.  <br>
<font color="blue">Daknor</font> I have been corresponding with Daknor through email for quite some time, and it was only today that I finally met her, yes her!  Imagine my surprise as this whole time I have been refering to Daknor as "he" and she never said anything.  Anyway Daknor is a very devoted EQ fan, and this site would not have come as far as it has without her efforts.<br><font color="lime">Arkblade</font> has been a good buddy of mine for years, he seldom speaks but is also an important part of EQO.  He writes the email updates, a job that Xebec a former member of the staff had.  Arkblade is always available to take your comments.<br><font color="orange">Xal</font> has come to the EQO staff as our resident map maker, she is getting better at it, and will be creating and updating all the Everquest maps.<br><font color="red">Wraith</font> thats me, you know who I am so I will skip my introduction :)<br><font color="cyan">Banshee</font> 
will be writing alot of editorials and stories about the Everquest experience, she is an avid RPG'r and has alot of time on her hands ;p<br><font color="purple">Dreadlord</font> owner of this domain and the administrator of the site, this site would not be possible without his money...er I mean devotion :)<br><p><font size=3><b>Logo's Displayed</b></font><br>I put up 989's and Verants (formerly Redeye) logos today, you wouldn't beleive how much email I receive asking if our site is the official Everquest site.  Well, no we are not, but above are now the logo's to the people responsible for bringing us this cool game.
You may also want to check out <a href="http://station.sony.com/everquest/">Everquests Official Homepage</a>.  This is not the official Everquest homepage, just a site dedicated to EQ :)<p>
<font size=3><b>Tommorows the day!</b></font><br>Tommorow at Noon PST, we all step into the world of Everqest for the first time.  Phase 4 will finally begin.  Everyone at EQO got their CD's yesterday, so if you still have not gotten one dont worry just check your mail!
And we'll see you all in Norrath!  Due to the servers having to approve your name, we'll let you know who our characters are once we get em rolled up and a name for them.<p>
<font size=3><b>Arrrgh IE problem</b></font><br>Internet Explorer always makes me re-write my code :-/  Fixed the Class section that had "issues" if viewed with IE.  Netscape was smart enough to understand the code, IE apparently was not.  So the class
section will be being updated throughout the day to correct it.<p><font size=3><b>Classes updated</b></font><br>A few of the class pages have been updated to include not only a description of the class, but starting spells, weapons allowed, etc.  All should be done by tonight, and also the ranger class will be added.  Sorry for the delay on that one.

</table><br><font size=3><b>Daknor's Email Address</b></font><br>Ooops, I had a talk with Daknor today and she told me she thought it was funny that she never received any e-mail.  I thought that was funny to since I get quite a bit of mail everyday.  So I sent a message to her email address and it came back as non-existant.
This is a problem on our end, Daknors email address should have been set up months ago, but soon we will be switchting to a new server that will allow unlimited transfers so we can finally put the AVI up and have everyone come and download it :)  Anyway, so for now we have set up a simple hotmail account for Daknor.

When we switch servers she, and the rest of the newest members of our staff will all have their own email addresses.<p><font size=3><b>Class guide and Neriak guide.</b></font><br>We will be adding the Neriak section soon, our map maker is bitching about how hard this city is to map, but we will have it up probably by the end of the week, it will include a map of the city, and seperate maps of the Rogues guild, Necro's Guild, etc.  Also Class/Race type guide will be up tonight or tommorow

</table><br><font size=3><b>A must read!</b></font><br>I have received an email about a preveiw or article or something that was written by Daniel Morris of PCGAMES.  After seeing the email I went out to the other EQ sites and found the <a href="http://www.everworld.net">Everworld.net</A> had some news posted up about it.  This guy Daniel Morris apparently was not at all impressed with EQ from a newbies stand point because this is an excerpt from that article:<p>
A dastardly example of this in EQ is this dispicable pastime
                          of some veteran betatesters: luring a tough beast into a
                          village to sic it on newbies strolling around town. This is an
                          Intolerable Act. Newbies are robbed, plundered, and taken
                          advantage of in myriad ways...all without reresentation, I
                          might add. It's good for laughs on the part of the offenders,
                          but it discourages the newbie and threatens the democratic
                          ideal of the online ethos.
<p>
robbed? plundered?  What is this guy smoking?  He must be +PVP or something then because in EQ if you are -PVP you CANNOT be robbed, or looted.  What is really funny is that this is what the same guy wrote about EQ in an editorial he did back on 8/13/98:
<p>
But if you decide to be
                  "no-PK," not only are you invulnerable to attacks
                  from other players, but you can't steal from them
                  or otherwise take advantage of your
                  invulnerability. PK characters get to steal
                  whatever they can, just not from any non-PK
                  characters.<p>
I guess I just don't understand that kind of contradiction.  Anyway, it isnt going to stop me from playing EQ :)
