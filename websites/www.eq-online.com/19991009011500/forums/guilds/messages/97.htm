<center><h2>Wielders of the Sword History</h2></center><p><b>Chapter I - Long ago</b><p>     The history of the Wielders of the Sword is ancient and shrouded in mystery. Legend states that<br>     at one time Norrath had a sixth continent known as Noldor. On the continent of Noldor a<br>     group known as the Wielders of the Sword was formed to destroy the wicked and evil that<br>     were attempting to gain a foothold. The group originally formed by a Lord William and Lord<br>     Guderian fought desperately for many generations against the brood of Veeshan until a<br>     stalemate was achieved. In an attempt to break the stalemate and prove his worth to his<br>     mother, a great chrystalline dragon known as Vinyamar made a daring attack upon Noldor.<br>     Although his attack left most of the continent burning and in ruins, Vinyamar was slain by the<br>     guild. The news of Vinyamars death soon reached his mother Veeshan. In a state of blind hate<br>     and rage Veeshan laid to waste the continent of Noldor. The seas rose, mountains rumbled,<br>     and volcanoes poured the fire from their bellies.

:      group known as the Wielders of the Sword was formed to destroy the wicked and evil that
