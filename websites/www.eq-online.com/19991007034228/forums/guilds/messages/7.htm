(Please excuse the cross-post, but I felt I should announce this on all boards where we have recruited in the past). <p>The Gnomes of Norrath is a guild of EverQuest Gnomes dedicated to promoting the Gnome race in Norrath. If you are a Gnome, or are sympathetic to Gnomic causes, please read on. Imagine the surprise of the "Talls" as they see our troupe go through their city, completing quests that they thought were impossible! Whatever humor they find in our band will soon disappear as they see our great accomplishments! <p>We are currently accepting applications from Gnomes who are not Kewld00dz or Necromancers. Once Phase 4 starts, we will close the open-application process and start accepting applications by invitation only. This means you would need to create your character on whatever server we are on, and then adventure with us in hopes you are invited to become an initiate. <p>Our current roster: <p>12 Gnome Magicians <br>5 Gnome Wizards <br>8 Gnome Enchanters <br>7 Gnome Clerics <br>2 Gnome Warriors <br>4 Gnome Rogues <br>-- <br>38 Gnome Initiate Members <p>6 Honorary Members of various races (including Gnomes). Honorary Members have already been restricted to invitation only. <p>
