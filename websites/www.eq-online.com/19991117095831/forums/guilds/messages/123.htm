: The Drifters Charter

: 
: 	As a guild, the Drifters serve to protect the innocent and righteous while at the same time exploring the lands of Norrath, in this plane and others, to bring forth knowledge of lands unknown.  We have no true home, but instead travel from city to city helping others and gathering knowledge.  We are always seeking others to join this guild and we hope that you ore one of them.  No matter what your race or class, as long as you fight for the side of all that is good, you are welcomed into our clan.

: 	Although we do have goals to serve in this world, we will always make time for fun.  We will frequently hold meeting and events for socializing and fun, including happy hours, races, hunting contests and any other games that we might come up with.  

: 	If you are interested in forming this guild with us e-mail me at kmickle@pipeline.com, or Executive Officer Zenimer at rgl1999@mindspring.com.
