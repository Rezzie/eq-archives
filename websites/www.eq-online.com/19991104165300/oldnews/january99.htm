</table><br><font size=3><b>Confirmed Ship date for Phase 4 CD's</b></font><br>An Everquest fan named Roman Borodyansky sent Arkblade this in an email:
<p>
Hi there.
Called up the everquest contact line and asked them when will the phase
4 CD's will be sent out. The response that I got back was really cool.
The guy that answered the telephone told me that the Phase 4 beta CD's
where sent out on Thursday, Jan 28.
<p>
YYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<p>
Just thought that you would be interested in hearing that.<p>
Thanks for the tip Roman.
<p><font size=3><b>Complete List of Deities</b></font><br>Everquest.com has posted what looks like the entire list of Deities.  They will be up here tonight.  The character creation guide will also be "re-designed".<p><font size=3><b>AVI Finished!</b></font><br>The long awaited AVI is done, we are securing the webspace for the AVI for downloads, and will have the link up for download early next week!  The AVI will show a Minotuar battle, and a high level Shadow Knight running around slaying things.
                                        <p>

</table><br><font size=3><b>Phase 4 Dilema</b></font><br>There have been quite a few emails sent our way on the Phase 4 dilema, it seems more than one person could not get their Phase 4 cd's.  Whether it was either that their credit card number could not be validated or they did not receive the e-mail until it was to late.  It has happened.  Therefore, when EQO gets into the Beta.  We will try to petition for extra beta 4 accounts.  And will keep everyone updated on our progress.<p><font size=3><b>The AVI is coming!</b></font><br>The long overdue AVI file is coming soon.  We should have it out by phase 4 if not before.  Daknor and I started over with the AVI footage today.  There will be parts we keep from the original AVI file, and some new footage added.<p><font size=3><b>Previous News wiped</b></font><br>The previous news section of this page has been wiped.  Any pertinent information there that is relevant to Everquest such as the requirements for a guild, etc will still be available either by email or we

 might decide to post them up elsewhere on the site.<p><font size=3><b>Patch server update</b></font><br>This was on the <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/">EQVault</a> message board:<p>The patch server should be back up tonight we hope --<br>
                          we're switching to new patch server machines with more<br>
                          bandwidth and horsepower in preparation for phase 4. <br>

We all made it in.  And anxiously await our CD's.  I am also having some e-mail issues, so If I dont respond to e-mails right away please dont think I am ignoring you :)  For now I am having problems sending mail, seems I can receive it just fine.  So I am getting all your messages, just not able to reply.  This should be fixed soon.<p><font size=3><b>Phase 4 in Europe</b></font><br>We did manage to get a few CD's over to Europe but the cost of sending mass quantities was just way to much.  We sympathize with all those that did not get into beta phase 4, we will cover the entire beta 4 from this site, and keep you informed on EQ's development.

Greetings,<br> 
After some delays (due to hosting) I have recently opened up my<br> 
site to the public. It is about my character and his views and <br>
excursions throughout Norrath. It is kept in theme (roleplayed) as<br> 
much as possible. Take a look, you won't (I hope) be disappointed.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.riftwar.com/~trynlor/
">Dark Territory</a><p>
Two new guilds added and I am trying to respond to all the emails as soon as possible.  Today is the LAST day to sign up for the Beta Phase 4 if you have an authentication number, GO SIGN UP!

</table><br><font size=3><b>Phase 4 in Europe</b></font><br>The cost to ship the CD's oversea's is outragoues.  Plus the fact that you can't send them C.O.D.  We are looking into other options but time is running out.<p>  Spells page updated added all the spells for every class should be up now.  Sony's 989 has split, EQ now under Redeye Interactive, guess who is VP over there?  Our very own Brad Mcquaid, wtg Brad! hehe :)<p><font size=3><b>Phase 4 Adventurers List</b></font><br>Added a form for anyone who would like to post some info about themselves to try to find other ppl to adventure with.  The Phase 4 Adventurer list is up, what you do is fill out the form <a href="/p4submit.htm">here</a> and we will add your information to our upcoming Phase 4 Adventurers list.  This list will have ppl who want to get together and adventure with others online.  EQ is a great game, but sooner or later you gonna need to join a party!  So why not get a head start?

</table><br><font size=3><b>Phase 4 in Europe</b></font><br>We are trying to come up with a way to get our International Brother's and Sister's Phase 4 cd's.  We realize that we could always have ppl send the CD to our organizations address and then forward to them, but if we receive a thousand CD's that might be kinda hard to do.  hehe :)  We're looking into it and will have to see if their are any related charges, etc.  If we can possibly find a way to do it we will.  We know the deadline is Jan 22nd.  No promises, but we will see what we can do to bring EQ phase 4 beta to Europe!

</table><br><font size=3><b>International Concerns</b></font><br>Another letter has been sent out addressing the International concerns, here is a copy of that:<p>
Dear Phase 4 Beta Applicant:<br> 
Several questions have been brought to our attention following yesterday's email. We felt it important to address these issues and to keep our future testers informed.<p> 
1. International Customers - We value all of our customers, regardless of their location. We realize that by restricting Phase 4 of the EverQuest Beta test to US and Canadian residents, people outside this region are frustrated. Unfortunately, due to timing and cost limitations we simply were unable to accommodate you. We do apologize for this, and wanted to assure everyone that EverQuest WILL indeed be available internationally.<p> 
2. Timing Issues - In order to ensure that all Phase 4 CDs are sent out in sufficient time, it is necessary that you sign up by January 22nd. After that date, we will no longer be able to accept orders for the Phase 4 CD and the page will be removed. We will begin to process orders immediately and shipping of CDs should commence on January 27th. The test itself will begin February 10th and will continue until shortly before commercial release of the game on March 16th.<p> 
As always, we appreciate your willingness to help test EverQuest and to make it a revolutionary success. You have our commitment to keep you informed as we come closer to both Phase 4 and release.<p> 
The EverQuest Team 
<p><font size=3><b>Code Swap Board</b></font><br>
There is also a message board set up for anyone who has received <b>two</b> authorization codes.  If you want to give this code away or to someone who needs one go <a href="http://www.ji.nu/eq/board/index.html">here</a>.  This is probably your best bet at finding or giving away a code.<p>
Also if you received an extra Beta account you can give this away also apparently it is fine with Brad if you do :)

</table><br><font size=3><b>Phase 4 update!</b></font><br>Phase 4 to start February 10th.  Check your inbox if you haven't yet, you should have the phase 4 email, a copy of what it says is on our <a href="/general.htm">General</a> Message board.  Apparently the CD's are only being shipped to US and Canada.  I talked to a buddy of mine in Scotland yesterday who was more than a little upset that he could not participate in phase 4 because of this.<p>With phase 4 beginning so soon, many other online games I have been on, (although I don't play UO) have become ghost towns.  Alot of players cancelling accounts and leaving other games for the promise 989 brings with Everquest.  I for one will be among those leaving the current online RPG's I play to go to Everquest.  There just is no comparison.<p>Also with the release of Phase 4 brings an end to the current NDA.  We here at EQO will try to bring the game to those who did not get into phase 4.  By providing screenshots, editorials, answering questions, and giving a
d

vice, and guides on how to play and what to do once you get in.  This should be helpful for all you folks that have to wait until March 16th.  As always email us with any questions, or things you would like to see up and we will provide them.

</table><br><font size=3><b>Phase 4 announced!</b></font><br>Ok it's official, Everquest phase 4 beta set to begin in February.  Check your inbox for the second email.  We have received reports that not everyone who was selected for Phase 4 has gotten theirs yet.  Daknor got his before the rest of us did.  Be patient I am sure it will show up soon.<p>Once again any phase 4 testers interested in supplying us your experiences or tips in EQ send your stuff to <a href="mailto:arkblade@eq-online.com">Arkblade</a>.  He will compile all the information and give it to me to post up.  Phase 4 is gonna be a mad house but we plan on increasing the size of this site considerably.  Your input would be appreciated.  We already have 57 testers ready to send us the info or share stories of their EQ experiences.<p>Seeing as how it is so close to the release of Phase 4 we will be releasing the AVI after Phase 4 starts.
