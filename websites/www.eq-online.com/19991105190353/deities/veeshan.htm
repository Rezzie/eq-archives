<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_veeshan.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>Non-dragon followers of Veeshan believe that dragonkind is
 superior to all other forms of life. They swear allegiance to
 the Mother Of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or
 their loved ones to one Her children. In return for this
 undying devotion, Veeshan is very protective and generous
 to her loyal followers. Many humanoids have gained great
 riches and ancient knowledge through servitude to the
 Wurms, but these gifts came with a high price...knowing
 that one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they
 can take your messy life whenever it suits.
