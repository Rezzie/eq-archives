: A fledgling guild is being created on Solusek Ro entitled The Company.  The driving force behind this guild, simply put, is to make money.  The Company isn't one of those guilds questing for unattainable themes like truth or justice.  We prefer benefits more... concrete.

: Political and moral aims are secondary to the drive for profit, and The Company aims to make its members richer by providing a constant market for sellers and buyers, sharing quest items and trade requirements (pelts, jewels, etc.)  

: A web page should be constructed in the next several days, but in the meantime, a charter has been put online, at:
