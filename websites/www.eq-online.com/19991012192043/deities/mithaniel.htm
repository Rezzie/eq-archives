<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=167 HEIGHT=259 SRC="d_mithaniel_marr.gif"><font face="helvetica" size=2>The Followers of Mithaniel Marr belive that valor is what

 separates civilized beings from beasts. His followers live

 by a strict moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity.

 They are champions of the downtrodden and the most

 noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid Norrath of all

 things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in this

 never ending quest. They will not rest until the day when all

 of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. They take

 themselves and their duty very seriously, and have little

 patience for mischief or mayhem. Many paladins are

 devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.
