: Siegmund, the GM of Wolves of Odin(WoO), and Numic have been most helpful in clearing this matter up.  
: Their member, Idaho's claims and justifications for his actions are however highly doubtful and we continue to hold him in contempt.

: Siegmund and Numic have been happy to negotiate and offered apologies where necessary.  We therefore withdraw our outstanding /guildwar challenge.

: Vanderben will get no respect from us however.  Albion will never recognise him as holding a position of leadership or any other form of authority within the Wolves of Odin.

: It should be noted that during negotiations WoO made allegations about an Initiate of Albion interfering in a WoO guild matter, which occurred prior to the recent hostilities.  This unrelated event is nonetheless being investigated.  We take all such allegations very seriously in Albion and we are keen to reassure all concerned that the matter will be dealt with appropriately.

: It is our understanding that largely down to this uncomfortable situation between Albion and WoO, the recruitment principles and guild structure of WoO are now being revised internally.  We wish WoO the best of luck in trying to set things straight and hope to enjoy a more constructive and amiable relationship in the future.
