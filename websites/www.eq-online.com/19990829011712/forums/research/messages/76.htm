: Ok, for all you mages and stuff out there I give you hints on how to research correctly.

: First:

: DO NOT buy QUILL or PARCHMENT these items are NOT needed in the creation of spells.
: FORGET about languages they serve no purpose unless you want to read the recipe books which have already been translated and are up on the web!

: Ok, now on to research, You will need:

: A tome to combine in, different one for each class -- they are:
: Lexicon - Wizards
: Elemental Grimoire - Magicians
: Tome of Dark Bindings - Necromancer
: Tome of Endless enchantments - Enchanters

: No other fucking class gets research only ones mentioned above!

: Ok, now what to do with these?  Go to www.mythiran.com and look at the recipes there.

: I give you an example, to make necro spell Banshee Aura you need Words of Divination and Words of Eradication.
: Now be very careful because Verant do some tricky shit and name some words close to others.  Like there are Words of Derivation.
: You want words of diviantion, so dont get confused make sure spelling is exact!

: When you get these words place in your Book of dark bindings, as I said before PUT ONLY WORDS IN NO QUILL OR PARCHMENT!
: Now once you have one copie of each of the words in your tome hit combine, pray, and maybe you get a spell.

: You can train research 5 points per level.

: The same goes for the rest of the magic using classes only wiz's use runes and Enchanters use grimoire pages.  For enchanters you must have left and right side of same page to make a spell (i.e. left and right half of page 26).
: Wizards combine runes, and you mages get really fucked and have to combine all sorts of wierd shit to get spells.

: Anyway have fun, and go make some spells...

: Nixx out!
