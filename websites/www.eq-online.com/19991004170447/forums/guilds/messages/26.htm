: The KoT has shown its presence in Major MUD's, Diablo, Ultima Online and numberous other online games.  We are now looking to spread our presence to the world of EverQuest.  

: Looking for players who want to take what is theirs by force and swiftly cut down those rival guilds that try to stand in our way.

: This is not a PVP guild out to kill everyone in the world, but one that looks to build a good group of players that want the taste of blood on their lips from a well organized war with other guilds.

: None have ever stood in the way of the KoT and we plan on keeping it that way!

: Remember it is your world, we just control it!
