Bards, one of my all time favorite fantasy/RPG classes.  Downplayed badly in D&D, in EQ they do not have this problem.  The bard can be a powerful addition to any adventuring group.
The songs they weave have magical effects that usually are beneficial to an entire party.
<p>
Beginning a bard is rather easy.  The first thing you want to do is go find your guild.  And do the guild quest thing.  Get your newbie tunic and head out to earn enough cash to buy your first song, <i>Chant of Battle</i>.
Also while at your guild you might want to ask around to see if they have any quests available for you.
Bards are comparable fighters, although not as good at fighting as a warrior they can hold their own pretty well.  Once you have enough gold, get your first song.  Bard songs are memorized and scribed just as magic using classes do it.
You get a scroll you scribe it and then mem it.  Most bard songs will either last until you zone, cancel the effect, or get hit really hard by a monster, whichever comes first.
<p>
Chant of battle will help you out there in the field, it raises your strength and dexterity and gives you a little edge in fights.  This song affects a party as well.  After you begin using this song you will notice your singing skill going up.
This is good, you can raise it fairly quickly because you will almost always be singing something.  Every level (unlike magic using classes) you get a new song.  Only one, but at least you get them every level.  The second level song is an attack song.
It's called <i>Chords of Dissonance</i>, and it will damage anything in it's radius of effect.  So be careful, the first bard I made sung this song in his guild after he bought it, big mistake, as all the NPC's came down on me.
So be careful with this song dont sing it to close to guards or NPC's.  Also, if fighting and you start to sing it, anything in its area of effect will attack you once hit by it.  The best way to use this is to tag a monster and then "kite" it back to a safer area, where there is less monster traffic and continue to beat on it and sing the song.
<p>
At 5th level you get percussion.  This means that you can now use a hand drum, which I would recommend.  You also get a very cool song named <i>Selo's Ascelerando</i>.  This song lets you move faster, and the higher your percussion goes, the faster you will go.
You can outrun alot of things, but only if you have that drum equiped.  Without it you dont move nearly as fast.  The only problem with equiping the drum is that it takes up both weapon slots, so the only thing you can do when it is equiped is punch.  But if you have good percussion skill you can outrun almost anything anyways.
This song also affects all your party members.
At 6th level you get a very useful song <i>Hymn of Restoration</i>.  This is your healing song, and is greatly enhanced by use of a lute or some other stringed instrument.  You get skill in stringed instruments at 8th, so you have a few levels to go before you get that.
But this song will help, I sung it constantly while I was fighting when I was 6th to 8th level.
<p>
As you can see the bard is very useful.  And you should have no problem finding a group to party up with, a bard is usually always welcome in groups.
