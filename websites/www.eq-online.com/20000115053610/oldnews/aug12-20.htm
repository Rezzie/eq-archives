<font size=2 face="helvetica">
Rallos Zek: The Straylight Saga Continues
 <p>
The Book is in Freeport, the Temple of Marr, under the protection and guidance of the strange Teir'Dal child, Sazami.  The
Feir'Dal, that the Priests of Marr sent for, has already conducted his preliminary translation.  The Straylight Gem was guarded
by a Dragon.  Could it be with Lady Vox?  No one is sure.  There were three Dragons existing at the time the Book was
written: Grand Malice the Red, Lady Vox, and Nanabrintariel the Fairy Queen.
 <p>
And what is this about a Ceremony that is involved with the book?  Magic from all the Light Races?  A Wizard's Circle in
Faydwer?  What dire consequences could this spell for the Trolls and Ogres and Teir'Dal?
 <p>
And the strange notion of the Saviour?  A child?  Could it be Sazami is this child?  She is a very odd thing.  Or could it be
Mahlyce's child to be born?  Mahlyce is nearing term.  But where is Mahlyce?  Rumours have it that she has been kidnapped
by the Blood Coven, to take part in some Black Mass.  Some believe Mahlyce's child to be the child of Innoruuk himself.
 <p>
Will The Horde find her in time?  Can Petunia save his special Inkie, Mahlyce, from the designs of the Coven?
 <p>
And where will the Elven Council of Faydark stand now that it has been verified that the Book is genuine, that the Feir'Dal
legend is truth?  Can they stand the thought of their book being possessed by humanity?

Server: Innoruk<br>
Re: Ogre/Troll Bash O Rama Tournament<br>
<p>
the Guild of "The Last Ones" is commited to the principals of Honor, and the
Spirit of Cooperation throughout Norath. In an effort to make the lives of
new players a little easier, TLO hereby announces its Ogre/Troll Bash O Rama
on the Innoruk Server, Date: Sept 4th, Time: 6pm PST, 9pm EST, Location S.Ro
Dessert at the entrance to Innothule Swamp. A dueling tournament for new
players levels 5-10. Grand Prize is a Bronze Breast Plate, and either a
Tentical Whip or Runed Totem Staff depending upon character needs. Prizes
for each bracket winner and runner up will be either a Bronze Piece or
Ringmail Tunic, Leggings, or Helm AND either a Fine Steel 2H Sword or a Fine
Steel Great Staff depending upon character needs. TLO also recognizes that
it is actually the losers who need the most help, and so TLO will be handing
out Ringmail Armor and Fine Steel Weapons to all participants. Rules are as
follows:
<p>
1) No magic weapons.
<p>
2) No armor greater than Banded.
<p>
3) No grouping, heals or help from other players. Violators will be
disqualified, publicly humiliated, and banished from the lands!
<p>
4) Casters may buff before combat and cast during.
<p>
5) Duelers will enter the ring, Inspect each other, and then wave at each
other signifying acceptance of the others items are legal. They will each
then hit the Duel button when ready for combat. If a contestant feels his
opponent has illegal items, or is overly buffed for a new player, /shout it
out and a general consesus will be reached wether to disqualify opponent, or
have him duel a similarly buffed player.
<p>
5) Duels can be to the death, but not required. A zone entrance will be
nearby and available for those who wish to flee.
<p>
Brackets will be single elimination duels and the brackets are as follows:
<p>
Bracket 1: Levels 5-6 - 1st Prize=Bronze & FS Weapon, 2nd Prize=Ringmail &
FS Weapon
Bracket 2: Levels 7-8 - 1st Prize=Bronze & FS Weapon, 2nd Prize=Ringmail &
FS Weapon
Bracket 3: Levels 9-10 - 1st Prize=Bronze Breast & Magic Weapon, 2nd
Prize=Ringmail & FS Weapon
<p>
With the grand prize going to the winner of Bracket 3 after the oppurtunity
is given for the winners of Bracket 1 & 2 to challenge for the grand prize.
<p>
Enrollment send e-mails to Sir Goad Dem'Good at address dcrooks@deepwell.com
with your character name and projected level for date Sept 4th. Or send
/tell directly to Goad in the game.
<p>
This tournament is mainly to help new characters get a start in life. No
player seeded characters or overly buffed characters will be allowed to
compete (meaning that a 10th lev Ogre with full banded mail and FS weapons
is clearly not a new player). So if you have ever thought about starting one
of the most powerfull fighter classes in Norath, now is the time to do it.
With the help of the Guild TLO you will be bashing monsters with impunity
and wading through trains like a tidal wave. Feel the POWER of the Dark Side
Luke! See with remarkable clarity with Ultravision. Come one, come all to
the TLO Ogre/Troll Bash O Rama and start your new character today!
<p>
All guilds and citizens of Norath welcome. Traders are welcome to come hawk
thier wares. The Trolls promise not to eat Brewers and Bakers as thier
merchandise is geatly appreciated. High level dueling is encouraged for
after the Tournament. Dont miss out on all the fun, plan to attend and see
the awesome might of Da'Bashers!
<p>
TLO is committed to the principals of Honor, and the spirit of cooperation
throughout Norath. Dont feel left out, TLO will be sponsoring newbie
tournaments and recruiting caravans to every newbie zone in Norath. Type
/who all "the last ones" to contact a representative near you! TLO welcomes
all Races/Classes. We are a guild that praises Honor above all, stands for
power through Unity, and believes in the natural progression through the
game by grouping for items. We declare ourselves enimies of the High Level
Item Stealers for Profit, and whenever it is found, a TLO Power Pardy is
only a /guildsay away to come and drive the dishonorable wretch away!

"The Last Ones" Power through Unity, Compassion through Conscience!<br>
