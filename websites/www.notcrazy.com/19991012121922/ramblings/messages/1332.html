: Since latest patch is anyone else having problems connecting to Chat Server?  Has anyone else ever reached a live body on phone technical support? Have you always been told to call back later when phone lines are not so busy?  I am working on my graduate degree in information systems. Think I should do a paper on the failure to communicate.<p>: so far some patches seem more bug prone than others, but that's how it always seems to be.  I'm well pleased with the new patch methods, since they at least appear to cause less problems and certainly take less time to download.  Tell us your opinion, is it ok now or getting worse all the time?
