The Tale

Authors Note: This tale does not take place in the realms of EQ, GS3 or any other muds, however some things you find you may have heard from them.  All towns and people were made by me, any similarities in names is completely coincidental.  Thanks for reading and please enjoy! :)<BR><BR>

<B><I>Chapter One: The Notice</I></B><BR><BR>

<p>The Sylvan wizard Amalion lay sleeping in his bed in the quite town of Bellente, twisting softly in his sleep slightly disheveled from last nights drinking contest with his warrior cousin Argmen.  He still wondered to himself why he would ever try to beat his cousin, maybe he just wanted an excuse to get drunk.  Even being cousins their appearance differed greatly.  Amalion being Sylvan was about 5'7, maybe 125lbs, with somewhat softer features, long sandy blonde hair, and gleaming emerald green eyes.  He appeared around 20 in human years, although he had been around much longer then Argmen.  His cousin Argmen the Barbarian was the perfect warrior, 7' tall, 324lbs, unkept raven black hair, and dark eyes.  They would often joke about who was better with the ladies.  Just then the young message boy burst though his door at 6 A.M. yelling.</p>

<p>"Lord Amalion! Awaken!" The youngster shouted, a boy no more then 12.</p>

<P>Amalion's eyes shot open as he rolled off of his bed and onto the ground. "aCk!  what in the blasted...boy, what in the name of the gods are you doing!  can't a man git any sleep in this town, gods this is what I came here for."  He then proceeded to brush himself off and stand, scratching his head, yawning.</p>

<P>The youngin was now almost jumping up and down, a glint of fear in his eyes, "M'lord there's talk of an attack on this town!  A group has formed determined to take over Bellente!  Your cousin told me to tell you, quickly quickly to the meeting hall!"</p>

<P>Uttering a string of obscenities Amalion put on his robes and ran after the boy to the meeting hall.  He walked into the middle of the meeting, inside he saw the town elder talking among the mobs of people.</p>

<P>"The scouts say we only have about 1 month until attack and we've never seen an army quite like this.  Our militia just isn't big enough to protect this town from certain takeover.  This is why I've called you all here, I know many of you are just visiting, vacationing if you will in our quiet town, but now we need everyone's help."  The old man straightened himself and took a deep breath, "I'm not telling anyone that they need to sign up for the militia, but I do know that many of you do enjoy the peace of our town.  To keep it this way we must preserve it.  We really didn't know of any reason why someone would want to take over this town, until we found that we are the halfway point between the two major towns of Mendagio and Norantis.  Many adventurers come here to rest from a long journey, but with this army in control they can make attacks on weary adventurers. They will also control this entire territory."</p>

<P>The elder sighed once again and fell into his seat, "I've gotten too old to lead attacks for this town, this is why I've had to make the decision of appointing a General for our militia.  The choice was hard, and it took me much thought but finally I decided that our very own Argmen Rhiensburrow would become the new General.  Please give him a warm round of applause, perhaps he has some words for us.</p>

<P>The townspeople began clapping and cheering as the massive Argmen stood, wearing his chain hauberk, his two-handed sword sheathed on his back.  With a deep voice he began to speak, "This is...uhhh...an unexpected and most pleasant suprise and I will accept the position of General, thank you very much for the chance."  </p>

<P>The audience cheered once more, he coughed and then continued onward, "under my command there will be three units.  Mages, Healers, and Warriors.  Each will have a Unit Leader appointed by me.  As of right now I only have one candidate for one of these positions.  And that is my good friend, and cousin Amalion for the position of Mage Unit Leader.  Come Amalion, stand and say you'll accept the position."</p>

<P>"Oh blast it all"  Thought Amalion as he stood.  "I umm...errr...well ya see...I'm sure there must be a mage in this town more qualified then me...yes yes perhaps you should pick someone else Argmen, no?"</p>

<P>Argmen chuckled in response, "Amalion ol' man, you know there is noone else in this town more qualified then you, stop being so modest and say you'll take the job.  I know your just visiting this town, but truthfully you are at the moment the most powerful and strategic mage here.  Let's here what the people think, my fellow townsmen who here believes Amalion should lead the mage unit gimme an 'aye!'"</p>

<P>A round of shouted 'aye''s were heard and Amalion slapped himself on the forehead while thinking to himself, "there really is no way your going to get out of this Amalion...a vacation short lived."  </p>

<P>Amalion then babbled a few inaudible statements to himself before saying, "yes...fine fine I'll do it."</p>

<P>"Good man!"  Cried Argmen.  "Now we just need a Unit Leader for the Healers and Warriors.  Any nominations?"</p>

<P>Amalion brushed the hair out of his face and spoke, "I might have one for the healer position, and that would be my brother Oryis the druid."</p>

<P>Argmen nodded to him, "splendid, get him here and I'll talk with him."</p>

<P>"Oh I will"  Said Amalion with a smirk.  "I'll get him here as soon as possible."</p>

<P>Argmen once again took over the meeting, "if there is no other business, then with the elders blessing I will close this meeting."  He nodded to the elder, and the elder nodded back.  "Ok then, everyone go about your business and remember I need one more person for the position of the Warrior Unit Leader, come to me with nominations, of course a simple duel against me will decide who the leader will be."  Argmen finished his statement with a gleam in his eye.</p>
