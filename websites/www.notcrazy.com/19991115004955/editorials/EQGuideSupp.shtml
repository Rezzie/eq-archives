Many of us have seen the GMs of various on line games going around in their splendors and thought to themselves how cool it would be to be able to do the same thing.  These virtual game gods look to be so cool.  <BR><BR>
 
I have thought this myself and wondered how I might some day become a GM or in the case of EverQuest perhaps a Guide.  My opportunity to perhaps achieve this goal opened up to me during the beta test process when someone on the private testing board ask about the process for becoming a Guide.  The reply stated that in order to become a game guide for EverQuest the basic requirements were that you had to have taken at least 2 characters to level 10 and beyond.  The second was that you had to write a note to the EQ Seniors and tell them a little bit about yourself and your desire to become a guide.  I had a couple level 10 plus characters and ego enough to feel that I would make a great guide so I fired off a note immediately.  The exact date escapes me but I believe this happened just after the beginning of Phase 3.<BR><BR>
 
Almost 3 months after turning in my original guide application I received a note from the EQ Seniors which was a questionaire for Guide Candidates.  I will not reveal the exact questions contained in the questionaire but I will share some of my thoughts concerning it.<BR><BR>
 
The candidate questionaire is divided into several sections.  The first, the General Information, asks generic questions based on your basic qualifications and experiences.  The second section, Game Knowledge, asks a few questions based on specific things within the game.  Any of these questions could be answered correctly by asking a few of your friends and guild mates about them.  It would take some research but they all could be handled this way.  I do not believe that a great amount of weight is placed upon this section for this reason.  The third section of the application, Scenarios, asks you to role play yourself as a Guide "actually talking to the person involved".  I believe that the major weight of the questionaire is in this section.<BR><BR>
 
I looked over the questionaire and at first was daunted.  The game knowledge questions were not what I had expected.  Many of the answers could only be answered by asking a lot of your friends and game contacts.  I did not feel that this was the ethical way to answer them and therefore did not do so.  As I have continued in the game and kept these in mind, I have gradually learned the answers to a few more but even now I do not know all of them.  It has been posted a time or two that the it is not a "plethora of game knowledge" that is most important but instead the ability to use good judgement and "express themselves clearly and intelligently using the written word".  They also stress maturity and in fact require guides to be at least 18 years old.<BR><BR>
 
I spent several hours pouring over the questionaire and did my best to answer all the questions and particiularly the Scenarios with candor and in my opinion good judgement.  I submitted the questionaire and then began the waiting process.  I kept in mind the words of one guide I saw on the chat board several weeks ago.  He basicaly said it cost him a "pint of blood" and lots of efforts to finally be accepted.  <BR><BR>
 
A month after submitting the questionaire which I had poured my heart into I received a response from the guide review committee which I shall share in part.<BR><BR>
 
<font color="silver" size="-1">Dear Guide Applicant,<BR><BR>

Thank you very much for applying for the guide program and for your
commitment to the community of Norrath.  I am sorry to say that at this time
we cannot accept you into the Guide Program.</font>

 
I was so sure they would be able to see what a great job I could do as a guide for them.  I read and re-read the rejection note and finally came to a few conclusions.  I think first though, you as readers and perhaps potential guide applicants yourselves would be interested in more of this note.  I have included the rest of the note for this reason.<BR><BR>
 
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">As you may have gathered from our questionnaire, the Guide Program requires
excellence in several areas.  A guide must have excellent written
communication skills (including grammar and spelling), competent knowledge
of the world of Norrath, creativity, and strong interpersonal skills, just
to name a few.  Though you may excel in one or more of these areas, one or
more of them did not meet the requirements we set for ourselves.
If at any time in the future, you feel you have gained knowledge or ability
in any of the areas mentioned above, we encourage you to re-apply.  As
EverQuest continues to grow, so does its need for excellence in customer
support.  It is obvious from your application that you care about the world
of Norrath and are committed to making it a great playing environment.
We hope you will continue to find ways to enjoy the world of Norrath and
look forward to seeing you in the game.<BR><BR>

Thank you,<BR>
Ozymandius the Traveller, Recruitment Elder<BR>
The EverQuest Guide Program</font></blockquote><BR><BR>

 
I found this rejection particularly offensive particularly because it mentioned the possibility of re-applying if I felt that I had improved in the area I was lacking in.  Either I was of low intelligence, poor communications skills, or perhaps had no creativity.  There was just no way to know from this note what and or where I need to improve if there was ever a possibility of finally being accepted.  I gave this note some serious thought and quickly wrote a brief note back to them.  After a  few more days of consideration I wrote another more detailed reply criticizing the process. <BR><BR>
 
I will include one more line from the questionaire to help you understand my questions.<BR><BR>
<font color="silver" size="-1">It is a given that you do not know all of the Guide rules, so answer as you best see fit.   </font> <BR><BR>
  
I was particularly concerned with the rejection note because it implied to me that this particular portion of the questionaire was at least partially ignored.  When I wrote my second note to the EQ Seniors I concentrated on this particular fact.  With out knowing some of the guide rules and guidelines it was almost impossible to see what they had in mind and particularly easy to flat out tell them the exactly wrong things.  My reasoning at this time is that what they are looking for is a persons ability to bullshit the customers.  It is my personal opinion that creativity and bullshit are very often confused with each other.  I have come to believe this is the case with the EQ Guide program.<BR><BR>
 
I suppose I could tell you that each of my notes to the EQ Seniors was a mature and thoughtful response and I feel that they indeed were.  It was a couple weeks after my second note in which I criticized the process and particularly the lack of information available concerning the guide rules before I saw anything like a reply.  The EQ Seniors have not at any time bothered to reply to any of the notes I sent them.  I have a note from Ozymandius, Senior Guide, which was publicaly posted from which I take my answers.<BR><BR>
 
<font color="silver" size="-1">Customers that run around asking for information from other players end up 
with their applications set aside and not reviewed. They either know the 
info or do not know it. Customers that constantly badger for replies on 
their application or re-submit their questionnaire over and over have their 
questionnaires put in the same place.<BR><BR>
 
There will be no reply to any questionnaire that is not accepted, and the 
length of time that it takes to process a questionnaire, especially with the 
new loads we've received, ranges from 2 weeks to 2 months. Please be patient,
as patience is one of the most fundamental requirements of any Guide.</font><BR><BR>
 
There was a good deal more to his public note and it actually answered many of the questions that made my particular application a lot better had I only known.  As you can see though, they will not be answering any of my notes, more likely they are simply being set aside..  a "creative" term for the reclycling basket.<BR><BR>
 
I judge myself to be a mature adult and having raised 4 teenage daughters to adult hood with out killing or otherwise maiming or harming them. I believe myself to be a paragon of patience from this experience.  I do have a grey hair or two from the process though.  It chaffs me a bit to know that I was most likely being judged for maturity and what not by someone probably a decade or two younger and less experienced than myself.  I have to wonder if just perhaps true maturity was not understood because the one doing the judging was not of sufficient maturity to comprehend it.<BR><BR>
 
The bottom line for me then:  <BR><BR>
 
  If I ever figure out what I lack and improve it I can resubmit my application.  If I do resubmit the application or even ask about the possibility it will be set aside.  Perhaps I should also recommend the book Catch 22 for the EQ Seniors although I suspect they are too young to have knowledge of it.<BR><BR>
 
I really should mention that in the now 7 months of testing and playing EverQuest I have never had a bad experience with any of the Guides.  In saying that though I should also mention the strict policy that is constantly posted that you should never bother them.  My occasional posts concering bugs and other game problems were always treated quickly and reasonably.  <BR><BR>
 
EverQuest is a great game and the finest I have ever had the experience of testing.  I say this as an experienced tester of games over the past decade and I have seen both the gems and the dross.  It would be kind of neat if I were one of the Guides helping players along.  I imagine if my previous attempts have not permanently burned the bridge for me, I can be certain I have done so now.  Even so,  I have pre-ordered my copy of EverQuest and I look for it every day  in the mail.  I can hardly wait to be out there once again chasing rats and snakes.  <BR><BR>
 
Unfortunately I have lost some of the respect I formerly felt for the guides but this will not hamper my gaming unless they decide to start teleporting me to the deepest dungeons in recompense.  If you happen to see the corpse of Horzak chained to the stakes there in Grobb, perhaps you will know what happened.<BR><BR>
