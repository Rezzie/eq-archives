After seeing that Brad McQuaid had something to say about how <a href="http://www.eqvault.net" target="New">EQ Vault</a> stands on the issue of spoilers and other information that ruin the mysticalness of a game, it seems as though every major EQ site, and most of the minor ones, have jumped on the Spolier Opinion Bandwagon. Probably in hopes of getting a letter from Brad telling them how much he respects their site for not posting spoilers, etc. I am not going to do this.<BR><BR>
Spoliers ruin games for people thats a given. Anyone who likes a game, and has any respect for a game whatsoever, probably would not post spoilers. This is unlike those people who post all the spoilers for a game on their page, and then load the page down with banners in order to make a quick buck. I have too much respect for EQ, 989s, and the EQ fans who frequent the news sites and #everquest in IRC, to post these spoilers. I should not be having to say this. In fact, anyone with any respect for a game, should not have to state their opinions on spoilers, nor should their opinion be asked for. It should be a given. Anyone who even begins to consider wether or not they should post a games spoilers should ask themselves these questions: "What attracted me to this game?" and, if applicable, "What keeps me playing this game?"<BR><BR>
People who have considered posting spoilers and then decided not to make me think wether or not they truly respect a game, of if they are running a page simply for the extra money or the ego boost.<BR><BR>
Posting spoliers should not be an option to a true fan. Quite simply it is a matter of respect to both the game and its players.<BR><
Thanks for hearing me out on this.<BR>
