They are the secretive, mysterious class of the world, who sneak about in the dark. Some say they are assassins, and some that they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and they are capable of both. They are quite skilled with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to toe with a Warrior and prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. They would much prefer to not be discovered at all, or if they are, to not be there for their opponent’s blow to land. The darker skills of picking locks and stealing are also their forte. As for some more technical information, +pvp rogues will be able to steal from other +pvp players, as well as from NPCs (of which there are thousands, btw), and rogues will also have both the hide and sneak skills, however, their ability to climb walls will be no different than the climbing abilities of then other classes.<BR><br>
