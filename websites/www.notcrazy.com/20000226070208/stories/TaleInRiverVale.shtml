<p>Hello, my name is Ganderlin.  I am a High Elf residing in Felwithe, a most beautiful city in the glorious Elven lands of the Greater Faydark.  This tale is one of great heroism and adventure.  It is one of many adventures I have had with a good friend of mine as I travel Norrath in search of knowledge and advancement of my skills as a wizard.  Rahlek is a Human monk who reveres the lands around Freeport as his home and battleground.  He is a noble fighter, though a bit careless, and that is how my story begins.

<p>Rahlek is a traveler like myself.  Our greatest joy is to wander the plains and forests of Norrath in search of exotic creatures and treasure.  One day Rahlek happened to stumble upon the Halfling Village of Rivervale.  He was amused by the diminished size of the village and decided to stay a while.  He used the nearby Misty Thicket to further his skills and gain treasures.  It happened that he ran across the goblin citadel of Runnyeye.  He ventured in, eager to slaughter the foul creatures.  The caverns in Runnyeye proved to be numerous and quite perilous.  He soon came across a large open cavern that opened up into quite a depth below him.  A bridge spanned the depths upon which a menacing Slime Elemental patrolled slowly.  At the bottom lie a pool of green slime.  As he gazed down into the pit he must have been mezmorized by the great height, or the green glow, or something, because he managed to fall off the cliff and headlong past the Slime Elemental and into the Grime at the bottom.  He sat in the muck, quite flustered.  Before he could paddle more than three times he was attacked by goblins.  Here, in the depths of the dungeon, Rahlek was defeated.  

<p>Mystically Rahlek appeared in the city of Rivervale where he had been bound by a kind spellweaver.  He ventured back into the depths of Runnyeye in search of his corpse and his loot, which held much treasure.  After a few vain attempts at retrieval he found that where he had died was much to deep in the dungeon to escape with his life, and his possessions.  He sat, disgruntled, trying to figure out a way to retrieve his belongings.  Soon and Idea popped into his head and he sent word for his good friend, Ganderlin.

<p>Here I enter the story.  I was happily hunting the legions of the foul orcs in Crushbone, north of the Greater Faydark when I was brought a message from Rahlek.  It requested my presence in the middle of Antonica for a matter of great importance.  I winced at the idea of crossing half the world for this, but I knew I must assist Rahlek in what ever it was that cause him to send a messanger thus far to reach me.  I gathered my belongings and headed to Rivervale.  

<p>I arrived in Rivervale two days later and found Rahlek standing stoically.  He explained his situation and I realized his plan.  He wanted ME to jump down the pit in Runnyeye and retrieve his belongings.  Ordinarily a person would not do such a thing, but I happen to be a wizard with a spell entitled "Gate."  So, I gladly jumped into the chasm to retrieve my friends things.  With the proper permission I should have been able to loot Rahlek's corpse, but this did not work for some reason beyond me.  Rahlek and I decided that he must jump down, loot his body, and give his things to me so I could Gate home with them.  

<p>All was going well, Rahlek had just finished looting his body and was just about to pass them on to me when we were attacked by two goblins who happened to jump into the muck.  We fought valiantly but the goblins were cowardly.  They would fight until they were hurt then return shortly when they had healed.  We found our health failing us from the constant attacks.  Soon we found an opening where we could breath some, quickly Rahlek gave his things to me and instructed me to get out.  I obeyed and cast the Gate spell just as the Goblins returned.  However, I found that the spell I cast was finished much to quickly to be gate and I was transported 10 feet away rather than to Rivervale where I was bound.  I had cast the spell "Fade" Thinking it was Gate!  I quickly jumped back onto the ledge where Rahlek was battling the two goblins.  I had to memorize gate quickly.  I sat down to memorize it when one of the goblins attacked me and forced me to stop, I sat down again, ignoring the blow, and again the goblin hit me.  A third time I attempted to sit down but was interrupted.  Finally, on the forth trial, I managed to memorize Gate.  I stood up and began my casting.  Unfortunately as I began I saw Rahlek fall before me, Dead.  The Gate spell would take some time to cast and I knew the goblins would attack and interrupt my spell.  I continued with my fingers crossed.  Halfway through my casting I heard the terrible noise of the goblin swinging his fists toward me.  Through a miracle granted from above the goblin missed and to my surprize I faded out with but 15 hitpoints left.

<p>Rahlek and I both appeared in Rivervale at the same time where we rejoiced in our victory over the Runnyeye Citadel and its inhabitants.  I gladly returned his belongings and we rejoiced some more with much brandy and ale.  Later, still boasting of our accomplishment, we traveled to Qeynos for the first time.  

<p>I end my tale with these words: Do not underestimate the power and usefulness of a wizard, nor the ingenuity and stoic resolve of a monk. 

<p>-Ganderlin
