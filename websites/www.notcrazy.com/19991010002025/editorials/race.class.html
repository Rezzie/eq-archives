	This may sound a bit like I'm strolling down memory hill, but I
believe that I've had a good deal of experience in viewing what real
Race/Class interdependencies are in an online MUD. This was in regards to
the UO vs. EQ treatise in which Faust mentioned how such an interdependency
within a group (or party) would function. I've been in such groups, but
instead of the RP possibilities of having such a diverse group, we had a
greater necessity: survival. </br>
<BR>    A specific MUD clearly illustrates how such a group would form based
sole on the need to survive. It was called Sojourn, a heavily modified Diku
MUD based on Forgotten Realms. Once you got past, say, level 30 you were
almost required to group with at least two others to survive. (Not saying
this is good..this is just how it was.)</br>
<BR>	A warrior always had to bring along a magic-user, either a cleric who
would negate the necessity of returning to town (literally a 20 minute walk
sometimes..text based), though the fights would take longer due to a lack
of sorcerous firepower (sorceror was synonymous /w 'nuker'); or a sorceror
would be able to bring down enough 'fire and brimstone' as to 'nuke' the
monster in two-thirds the time as well as stone-skinning the warrior so he
would sustain less damage. The warrior still had to chug a few potions
after or during the battle which were sorta expensive but generally worth
it. In both cases, the warrior tanked. 
<BR>	That was a simple example of race/class interdependence. Now..this is
what happened when we ventured into the Plane of Fire (or water or air..we
liked to kick @ss :)....
<BR>     The minimum group was about twelve to fifteen but as many as twenty
were allowed to come because they probably could survive and it was one
damn rare thing to spectate. (I was usually one of the latter than the
former.) This is how the battle would go:
	
<BR>	Preparation: All magic-users would memorize their most useful spells and
the tank warrior (level 50 /w all his +hp equipment on) would get stoned
(stone-skinned..not 'high';), bark skinned (druid), armored (cleric spell),
hasted (all warriors were hasted), and some clerics fearing the worse would
cast vitality(+hp <lots> temp.>
<BR>	Preparation would take like ten minutes while everyone switched from
'Prep' spells to battle spells.
<BR>Thus battle began:


	Warrior #1 would be the primary basher, he would bash the monster to
prevent it from casting.
	Warrior #2 would make sure the primary basher actually succeeded and if
not, he would hope to succeed or else:
	The monster got off an area spell (say..level 65 meteor swarm) and all
the sorcerors would die as well as the lower leveled clerics and druids.
Chaos would ensue and only a unsympathetic cleric with recall or a warrior
who did not bash (failing bash would 'stun' you for 2 rounds) and had a lot
of HPs would ever make it out of the Plane alive to tell of it. End story.
I've seen this happen (I was usually the recalling cleric ;)..it's not
pretty).
	If one got off the bash then..
	
<BR>	All warriors would be continously hasted (once their haste ran out, they
would scream for it loud loud through all the spam). They would deal the
bulk of the damage throughout the fight. This would cover Warrior #3,
Warrior #4, and most likely Warrior #5 as well. (Substitute Warrior for
Paladin, Anti-Paladin, Ranger, or Berzerker. Berzerkers were particularly
damaging with nasty headbutts and extra attacks).
<BR>	As soon as the battle begun, Cleric #1 would start a full heal spell on
the tank, healing about 400-500 hitpoints (the tank usually had 1000). Once
casted, the tank, newly healed, probably was down to 400 hp (from the
intitial 1000 + 400-500) after one round because the monsters could do
100-400 hp damage per round. The tricky part was that casting the spell
took two to three rounds. By the time you saw a particular nasty attack on
your tank, it was way too late to start casting to heal him. Thus Cleric #2
(and Cleric #3 for those smart groups) would start casting 'full heal' one
after another, layering upon layering 'full heals' on the tank. You'd think
the tank would be free from harm with three clerics full healing him. 
<BR>	Not at all, of course, because even the most highest cleric could only
memorize about five of these, supposedly, 'strongest' heal spells. You had
to sit down when you were down to one full heal left (just in case you had
to stand up and quickly cast to save your tank..and your entire party) and
memorize while the fighting was going on or else you and your brother
clerics would be thrity full heals shy of healing the amount of damage the
tank was actually receiving throughout the entire battle. Protective spells
or not. And if your tank was particularly cowardly or your clerics
particularly risky, your tank would scream 'Heal!' every time he was down
to 100 hp, full well knowing that he was dead anyways if a cleric hadn't
already begun casting, but sparing the breathe anyways. Being a cleric was
particularly fun. (I was one. :)

<BR>	Sorcerers,...Sorcerers, those prized 'nukers' of weaker monsters would do
only give scar tissue to the Dimensional Plane monsters. Thus, this was
their function:
<BR>	Sorcerer #1 would be the professional 'stoner', he would give full-time,
around the clock stone-skins to the tank, sitting down and memorizing each
one again to again recast it. Stone-skin worked as such: It absorbed about
95% of the damage of the attack but then 'chipped' away once the damaged
was too much. After two or three (of five or six) attacks from the monster
(per round) the stone skin usually 'chipped away'. 
<BR>	Sorcerer #2 would be the haster 'gives more attacks' for all the
warriors, casting and recasting haste to make sure every warrior could
fight at his or her best. Thus, during the battle, this sorcerer was indeed
busy rememorizing his spells and casting them around the room, involving a
lot of 'spell management' skill. (There was no 'good' 'bad' or 'master' for
this skill..you had to learn it the hard way ;)
<BR>	Sorcerer #3, probably the most high level of the group, would cast his
array of offensive spells (meteor swarm, bigby's fist, chain lightning)
continuously and then re-memorizing their spells while also watching out
for the inadequacies of the other sorcerors and clerics. If the group was
failing, this guy would call for the general retreat starting with all but
one of each 'type' of class and the tank last.
<BR>	Bard #1, a _really_ useful character to have in such a big group, would
most likely sing 'song of heroism' to add to the damage roller of the
entire group or 'song of soothing' to heal all in the group. Bards had the
only group-affect heals, +dam's, +hit's, etc and were extremely useful in
bigger groups. 
<BR>	Any thieves would be needed for their lockpicking skills only. Their
backstab and 'circle' (a while-in-combat backstab..much less damage) was
not as needed or useful in such large groups. A sad fact, one many MUDs try
to fix. (Sojourn was far from perfect.)
<BR>	Necromancers, however, were very useful in post-battle of any battle
leading up to the main monster or in any battle the group rushed to in
order to use the necromancer's sole talent. Sojourn was nifty for its
necromancers who could raise Vampires (these things were mega buff). The
vampire would be the tank, having usually 1500 hp and doing enough damage
with its innate vampiric touch to heal most of it. (This didn't always work
and the necromancer had to heal his creation more often than not..but it
freed up another warrior to go into 'damage' mode.)
<BR>	Shamans and Conjurers (both new to Sojourn) were sadly watered down
cousins of their originals with some real nifty spells (particularly summon
elemental for Conjurers..a high Conjurer could summon an equally high earth
elemental for a very nice tank). Though because these classes were 'new',
not many high ones were around to go to the level 65 Zones of Hell that we
traveled in at times. 
	
<BR>	Anyways, more to the point, even in a text-based game, there was a VERY
highly developed and evolved sense of timing and group skill within a party
that was necessary to survive. Members were not particularly wanted for
their 'level' (any joe shmoe could power-level to 40 and promptly get his
group killed from lack of true experience..some names come to mind).
Members of a group were valued for their knowledge in the 'group effort'
and their timing and skill to achieve such a 'group effort'. For only with
such a group effort were the Dimensional Planes conquered. Hey..it even
worked in the First Circle of Baator fighting Tiamat. Well, except that
they didn't let me go to Hell because one roar of flame from Tiamat and I
would have been toast with jelley (imagine what the jelley would be...)

<BR>	Anyways, I hope this gives a somewhat old-style reflection on how the ol'
text-based DIKU MUDS had to form groups more for survival than any sort of
kewl web page with nice graphics and their own chat channel. (I like the
ones that play music though :)
