You may count the 1-10 levels newbie, but you are 22nd. I am 9th, worked hard for it to. I believe it is a matter of charcter (flawed) of those that approach individuals well equiped like you and ask for hand out. They should never ask for items. Food/water I could sometimes see be asked for. I think you are doing GREAT in telling them no. If they ask for an item do not even offer them food. Keep on working. San.<p>: I cannot count how many times a newbie (levels 1 to 10 in my book are the newbie levels) has come up to me and said "You look rich, can I have some platnium?" or "Can you spare a god weapon or some armour?" ... the only question I have for these people is "How the hell do you think I got so rich? Do you think I recieved a lot of handouts?" The answer is NO ... I worked for all the armour and weapons and cash I have. The only exception to this is if someone asks for a few food and drink. I will give them 3 food and 3 drink as I usually carry a backpack full of food and drink. As for armour and weapons that is completly out of the question. I worked for my armour and my nice barbed whips (purchased ... I don't camp Bonecracker) and as such I believe others should work for theirs. <p>: Please reply with your comments on this issue as it is one of the bigger issues to work with.<p>: --<br>: Daedolon Pureblade<br>: Warrior of the 22nd Season<br>: Fennin Ro<p>: "Knowledge Speaks, Genius Listens"<p><br>
