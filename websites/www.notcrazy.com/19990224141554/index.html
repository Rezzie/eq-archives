<B><I>Brad Confirms Going Gold</I></B><BR>
<B><I>20:19:13 PST</I></B><BR>
This juicy tidbit came from <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds" target="AW">Altered Worlds</a>.<BR><BR>
<blockquotE><font color="white">
This is true -- a couple of days ago we went gold (actually, silver -- I think gold writable CD-ROMs are a thing of the past now).   <BR><BR>

So what does this mean?  It means the graphics are final (well, as final as an ever-evolving dynamic online RPG can be, meaning it's our intent to add
graphics and other new stuff after release to keep the game exciting).  It doesn't mean, however, that EverQuest is done.  We are still fixing bugs on
both the client and the server, and tuning and adjusting all the data that makes up the game.  Obviously, there will be a patch when people log in for the first time, which will consist of the client software and a few other small files.  And there will be patches after release as we continue to
make this a great and dynamic game (which I think is one of the greatest strengths an online game has -- the ability to adapt and evolve).  Phase 4 continues, and as you can see from our latest patch message, we are hard at work squashing bugs and getting this game ready for March 16th.  I remain confident that we'll have a solid game by release and urge all the beta testers out there to hang in there as we head into the final stretch.</font></blockquote>
I really hope they know what they are doing. While the game is more ready for realse than UO was before just before its release, I think there is still a lot that needs to be done.

<blockquote><font color="silver">
EverQuest is not a Player versus Player game although this is an option. Producer Brad McQuaid has said from the start that EverQuest sets out to be a Player versus Environment game ­ more reminiscent of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons style. Players are encouraged to group up, and in the higher levels this is pretty much a necessity from a survival standpoint.</font></blockquote>

<B><I>Test Server Patch Info</I></B><BR>
<B><I>13:25:26 PST</I></B><BR>
NEW PATCH ON TEST SERVER
------------------------
<blockquote><font color="FFFFFF">
The patch on the Test Server includes the following fixes:

1) Problem with people unable to enter the game after getting disconnected - We found this problem
and we believe we have completely corrected it.<br>
2) Seeing your own Hit Point bug - We corrected several problems in this area. You shouldn't
have any more problems seeing your own Hit Points any more. In addition, you shouldn't have
any more problems seeing the Hit Points of your own party or monsters you target. This should
fix the Paladin - Lay Hands on problem as well.<br>
3) Charm Spell problems - We should have fixed all the problems related to this spell, particularly
regarding Hit Points and other associated problems.<br>
4) Problems with falling thru the World while zoning - We believe this problem has been fixed.
If anyone still encounters this problem, please email us immediately.<br>
5) All Bards should now get Dual Wield.<br>
6) Rangers, Shadow Knights and Paladins should all get channelling.<br>
7) Several Crash Bugs have been fixed on both the zone and world servers.<br>
8) Several Combat bugs have been fixed regarding damage.<br>
9) You should now be able to target translucent creatures (also see note below).<br>
10) You can no longer trade with NPC's from any height.<br>
11) If you zone while anonymous, you will still be anonymous when you reach the new zone.<br>
12) Sound - We have finally activated music. You will only get music if you have a Sound Font
capable sound card. These cards include - Awe 64 Gold and Value, Awe32, SB Live - In the next
few days we will be activating the music on ALL sound cards. As this is code hasn't been
in before, please let us know of any problems you encounter.<br>

In order to run on the Test Server, run TestEverQuest.exe.

If the above fixes are stable, we will be releasing them to the other servers tomorrow
morning around 10am pst.

Other Notes:

We are currently working on the following problems:<br>


1) Boats - We will be fixing the problems regarding boats very quickly. This is a HIGH
priority item.<br>
2) Targeting - We are working on major improvements to the targeting system. We have listened
to our playerbase and are making many of the changes you have all reccomended.<br>
3) Losing Newbie Guild Tunics upon death.<br>
4) Invisible Players/Monsters/Corpses<br>
5) General NPC Pathing problems<br>
6) Various NPC's in the world that appear as humans.<br>
7) Various NPC's in the world that have the "can't open textfile.txt" problem.<br>

We believe the above items should all be taken care of pretty quickly (we are hoping this week).
We are also aware of other problems, and are working hard on many things. The above items represent
what we feel are the major problems.

Today I received a few emails all saying the same thing, but at this point I still consider it rumor and not fact. It was said that John Smedley was overheard saying in everquest chat that Everquest WOULD launch with a pvp server, and that the number of users on the server in beta IIII was not the deciding factor... Hopefully this can be confirmed or denied quickly.

This is the newest message from the patch server. and since I KNOW a lot of you who are in the beta dont bother reading these messages when shown the first time, here it is again. It just goes to show that Verant is not like OSI, and they WILL ban people who ignore their warnings.<BR><BR>

Talk about a short lifespan... This site had promise and I regret seeing it go. The text below was quoted from what remains of their main page:<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="silver">
<center>EQ Screenshots Closes<BR><BR></center>

 Below is the letter I received this evening from Brad McQuaid. My intention when starting this site, was to generate interest in the game through the use of it's stunning visuals. I really felt as though this would be helping the game, not hindering it. However, after reading this letter, I may indeed be hurting the vision that the creators of EQ have worked so hard to preserve. I do not feel that I am qualified to decide what is, or is not a 'spoiler', nor do I wish to ruin the experience for anyone, so I will no longer be sponsoring this site. I apologize to all those who have submitted wonderful screenshots, and who were so excited about contributing. Perhaps at a later time, a site like this will be practical and possible. For now, I trust in the creators of this wonderful game, as only they know what the spirit of Everquest shoud be.<BR><BR>

Thank you,<BR><BR>

Willowsong<BR><BR>

 

as the game progresses, please do me a favor and don't post 'spoiler' screenshots or screenshots of higher level areas, and areas that are difficult to get to. this can spoil the discovery and diminish the pride of seeing a new area for the first time. <BR><BR>

thanks, Brad McQuaid <BR><BR>

<blockquote><font color="silver">
Walking around more, you begin to notice the detail that went into this game. 989 worked very hard on this game, and it's obvious. The first little detail that hit me was the sky. The sky is done wonderfully. There are sunsets, sunrises, moonrises, and moonsets. It is very common to see people sitting on the dock and watching the sunset or rise. The thing that really blew me away was when it began to rain. The thunder is so real sounding..the lightning lights up the entire sky and rain actually falls. Looking up into the sky as the rain falls, you can almost feel it on your face.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="silver">
"PASSWORD!" boomed the Ethereal guard. His arm shot out to bar Elrath's path, and his other hand tightened around his halberd.<BR><BR>

The strange guard remained motionless. <BR><BR>

"You've got to be kidding. Nobody told me about a password." <BR><BR>

"WRONG!" bellowed the mist. <BR><BR>

"Let me in or I'll gut you where you stand." spat Elrath, thinking that was a mute comment...<BR><BR>

<B><I>Everquest on Playstation 2?</I></B><BR>
<B><I>20:31:36 PST</I></B><BR>
The following newsworthy bit came from today's Q & A at <b><a href="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/qa/1999-02-23.html" target="new">Next Generation Online</a></b>:
<p><blockquote><font size=3 color="silver">Q: What are some of the games being made for playstation2?
<p>A: That's hard to uncover. We know that Ubisoft is plans on doing some, as does Infogrames. Beyond them, most folks refuse to say whether they're planning on doing anything for the new console.
<p>We can guess 3DO will do something for it, likely in the Army Men and BattleTanx series. 
<p><i><b>As for first and 1.5 party games, Everquest might be a launch title for the PSX2 if it has a modem (which it almost certainly will)</i></b>. Crash 4 or 5 is a likelihood. <font size=3 color="gold">(Emphasis mine)

<B><I>Brad on EQ</I></B><BR>
<B><I>18:44:24 PST</I></B><BR>
A Disgruntled EQ player recently made accusations towards EQ stating that UO was a better environment for roleplaying. Of course, Brad can't let this be! He must retort.<BR><BR>


<blockquote><font color="silver">
UO -is- better for roleplaying. Hands down. End of discussion. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="white">Obviously I'm biased, but overall I'd have to disagree. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="silver">Can you lay out a feast (or any other roleplaying event, for that matter)in EQ? No. In EQ you can lay out food under your feet in a small, brown bag. In UO you can prop up furniture, music stands for bards, tables, food. Have a good time. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="white">True. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="silver">Can you roleplay to your fullest extent in EQ? No. You cannot engage a person in combat if he insults your mother, or insults your honor. Dueling? Only if he consents. In UO you can plan out that murder, poison your weapon, poison his food, or even hire someone to do it for you. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="white">It's not just dueling, it's regular PvP for those who choose to PvP, and it's anyone within certain level limits on the PvP server.</font> <BR><BR>

<font color="silver">Ever play on Catskills in Ultima Online? It's amazing. Warring families, extremist radical factions bent on revolution, organized battles, regular weekly gatherings. You name it, it can be done in UO. Cannot say the same for EQ. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="white">Actually, I can. You can certainly do this, especially on the PvP server. In fact, the level limits to PvP aren't present in guild wars (which warring families and factions would fall under). </font><BR><BR>

<font color="silver">Don't even try to say "EQ goes much further in that department than other games.." It limits it. </font><BR><BR>

<font color="white">Well, I suppose one could list all the things EQ has that promote role playing, like the races, separate starting cities, global chat, etc. I could also mention how the percentage of people choosing to play on the PvP server is but a fraction of those on the other servers.<BR><BR>

-Brad<BR><BR>


PS. It is absolutely not 'group or die' once you get to your 20s. As I've always said, some race/class combos are more suited towards solo play and others (most) towards group play. But it is and will remain possible to solo all the way up to 50 (and perhaps one day beyond). It takes more time, and is more challenging in one sense (although working together in a group environment certainly emcompasses its own tactics and skills), but definitely doable. <BR><BR>

Don't upgrade to icq99a unless you want a bunch of stupid cartoons, sounds, and options that really make icq look and feel like its owned by AOL (oh gee, i guess it is).  I was really hoping this product wouldnt get ruined by big business...

<B><I>A Magical Interview</I></B><BR>
<B><I>11:55:6 PST</I></B><BR>
EQVault has posted an <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/features/interviews/geoffrey.shtml">interview with Geoffrey Zatkin</a>, who is Verant's main man on the magic system in EverQuest. It's an interesting read that even talks a bit about the mysterious other planes of EverQuest.<BR><BR>

<blockquote><font color="silver">
We have laid a groundwork allowing for spells to have different effects on different planes of existence...we have the ability to make spells which do not work on other planes, spells that will ONLY work on other planes, and spells that have different effects on different planes.

Since the poll we just ran said you guys wanted player guides and maps, we have gotten to work on just that: player guides and maps. If you guys want to help lessen our load, you can send in your own players guide. We Are going to have a seperate players guide for each race/class combination. So make sure to include how your race compliments/harms your class. You can submit it using the submit news link at the top of this page.

While browsing around the web I came across this bit of news on <a href="http://www.everworld.net/">EverWorld.net</a>. It seems that <a href="http://www.planetcrap.com/">PlanetCrap</a> has recently brought the EverQuest Web-Site Community under the microscrope, specifically regarding EQVault's implemented Announcements board for Verant Employees.<BR><BR>

It's an interesting read and feel free to post your own responses to the story <a href="http://www.planetcrap.com/919596798/">here</a>. Of course you can always make use our very own <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/ramblings/">Message Board</a>.
