<B><I>14:50:26 PST</I></B><BR>
Heres a pretty good story from the Grudgebearers Guild.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
<hr>
"Terrible thunder shook the trees and water poured down from above upon the small forest. Lightning flashed and briefly illuminated every corner of Lesser Faydark. Animals scurried under large trees to take shelter from the rain. The forest was unusually gloomy and nothing could be heard on this rainy day... except marching.
 
<p>The Dervish Cutthroat Bandits heard it first. They were huddled in their tents, trying to keep warm. It was beginning to become more recognizable as it grew nearer. Many iron clad boots, marching in unison. The sound was clear and loud. Almost loud enough to be heard by anything in the forest. The Orcs heard it next."
<hr>
 
<P>Another Grudge Bearer's guild story (with pictures) about an expedition for Dwarven Vengence against the Orc's of Lesser Faydark on Fennin Ro.

<B><I>14:40:54 PST</I></B><BR>
Not sure how much of this is true. But still sounds good to me. Thanks Raene!
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">EverQuest Artist Rick Schmitz (he did the poster map art, deity sketches,
as well as design and animate inhabitants of Norrath) signed our book for
the <a href="http://www.2amstudios.com/eq" target ="new window">LampLighter
Post</a> and <a href="http://www.2amstudios.com/eq/rathe.htm" target ="new
window">Rathe Rhapsody</a>! Through a few emails back and forth, he was
able to tell me this about the new expansion pack that he and the team are
working on:
<p>
"All I can say is that some of the most impressive stuff that's in the game
now is stuff we did toward the end of development. We had the system wired
and we really knew what our engine was capable of. We are challenging
ourselves to do even more ambitious characters and backgrounds this time.
There will be announcements soon about what to expect (well, more like
teasers). I really do wish I could tell you more, because there's some
really cool stuff, but I am not the keeper of PR."

What sounds really cool is the berzerker rage mentioned later in this post.

<P><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Hello All,

<P>Well.. thanks to all of your help we've been able to find a significant
corpse dissapearence bug. We feel that this is a significant enough problem
to warrant updating the servers during normal hours today, as we don't want
anyone else's corpses to dissapear. We've also extended the amount of online
time characters above 5th level have to recover their bodies from 8 hours to
24 hours (online).

<P>In  nutshell, the Corpse Recovery rules are as follows:

<P>Characters All Levels: If you have no items on your corpse, it will
dissapear within 3 minutes.

<P>Characters Level 1-5: Corpse will dissapear within 30 minutes (real time)
whether you are online or offline. Those of you wondering why this rule is
in place? - There would be WAY to many bodies if we didn't do it this way.

<P>Characters Level 6 and above - Corpse will dissapear within 24 hours if the
player is online (being at the character select screen STILL counts as
online). Corpses will dissapear within 1 week if the player is offline.

<P>In addition, this server patch will include the following:

<P>1) Warrior's now get a "Bezerker Frenzy" if they are down to under 35% of
their Hit Points.
<BR>2) Several server side crash bugs have been fixed.

<P>I also wanted to mention that we have begun shipping units to Europe. Units
should be in Electronics Boutique in the UK in a few days. Germany and other
places in Europe will be hitting shortly...and Austrailia will be seeing
units shortly as well.


<P>John Smedley

<B><I>Bards Will Be Bards</I></B><BR>
<B><I>23:23:46 PST</I></B><BR>
When everyone seems to only be interested in mindlessly leveling and killing everything in site (there are level 34 characters already for pete's sake), it's nice to sit back and take in a concert. Here's the message from Jythri the bard: <BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Hail one and all!<BR><BR>
I, Jythri, write to you to announce the first official concert of The Soerbaird! <i>(group of bards for those who don't know)</i><BR><BR>
We will be performing in Freeport on two consecutive nights:<BR><BR>
DATES: <blockquote> Sunday, April 25, 1999<BR>
        Monday, April 26, 1999</blockquote><BR><BR>
TIME:  8pm PST<BR><BR>
PLACE:  West Freeport<BR><BR>
SERVER: Fennin Ro<BR><BR>
I will be singing several ballads, and we will also feature several master
bards and students of our Academy. So, if you're bold enough to enjoy a
time of song, story, drink, and celebration of heroic feats, come and hear
all you who would listen and live!<BR><BR>

<B><I>PC Accelerator does EverQuest, twice over.</I></B><BR>
<B><I>1:28:41 PST</I></B><BR>
<a href="http://pcxl.ign.com" target="_new">PC Accelerator</a> has done a few stories recently on EverQuest that seem to have been overlooked, which my companion on <a href="http://acnc.notcrazy.com" target="_new">AC-NotCrazy</a> pointed out to me. The First is in Regards to a lawsuit filed by petstore owners against the movie industry for creating an environment in which EverQuest was allowed to prosper.
<p>here is <a href="http://pcxl.ign.com/news/news_1541999_10.html" target="PCXL">the Full story</a> and a snippet:

<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
PCXL Assistant Editor Chuck Osborn has filed a lawsuit against Orkin, chain pet stores such as PetSmart, and makers of the movies Ben, The Secret Of NIMH, and the HBO production The Rat Pack for creating an environment in which the game Everquest has been allowed to prosper. 

<p>"The other PCXL editors used to enjoy normal games like Quake II and Tribes until Everquest came along," asserted Osborn tearfully, "Now they just sit around searching for rats to kill, their drooling faces vacantly staring at their monitors. I'm the only one left not sissified by this game...but who knows for how much longer?" 
</font></blockquote>

The Second, Earlier Story is a parody of the TV series, COPS, in which the cops are patrolling the valleys of EverQuest, and arrests a bug exploiter.

<p><a href="http://pcxl.ign.com/news/news_941999_20.html" target="PCXL">the Full Story</a> and a snippet:
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">

(Theme Music) Bad elves, bad elves, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you? 

<p>COPS...filmed on location in the land of Everquest. 

<p>Officer: We got a report of a berserk gnome outside of <BR>Qeynos. There's an all-points bulletin out for him and....wait, there's the suspect now!
<BR>(pulls over and gets out of car)
<BR>Sir...sir, can I talk with you a moment, please?

<B><I>Gnome-Elf Join In Matrimony...Ewwww</I></B><BR>
<B><I>11:16:18 PST</I></B><BR>
Regardless of what the children will look like congradulations to the them and their pursuit of racial harmony (I'm taking bets on how long it will last though :)<BR> Thanks to Raene for the news!<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Annwyl Anklestabber and Kinien Northoak celebrated the joining of their
lives in stunning fashion yesterday, April 17th, on the Rathe Server. The
joyous event between a gnome and a wood elf took place in ButcherBlock near
the Chessboard. Mills Lifestream performed the ceremony, Midoc Holywrath
was best man and Taoism Wyndfist was maid of honor.
<p>
Citizens from all over Norrath traveled to the event. In attendance were
dark elves, ogres, gnomes, wood elves, high elves, and humans. Only trolls
seemed to be absent...one wonders if they do not celebrate marriage, or if
they merely came disguised. High level Druids came in their Spirit Wolf
forms, and many diverse styles of armor and apparel could be seen.
<p>
Guests disembarking at the Kaladim port from far off evil lands were given
flags of truce and invised past the guards. They were also given safe
travel instructions around the edge of the zone to the wedding.
Unfortunately, there was one casualty when an invised dark elf ran too
close to one of the port guards. Sensing something not right, Guard Clendin
struck the air with his axe and felled the dark one. High Elf Cleric Ariel
Moon arrived on scene for ressurection. When all guests were in attendance,
the wedding began.
<p>
Attendees were asked to hold their spells until the ceremony was over. When
Mills announced that the groom could bend down and kiss the bride the
enthused crowd began their spell casting. 
<p>
The reception followed and featured many types of brewed beverages, a drunken
footrace, and the occaisional taunting and death of goblins. A ripping good
time was had by all! (except maybe the goblins)

Kerran Takeover on Solusek Ro, woohoo!! Kick some behind! ;_)

<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
I`d like to announce a major player event on Solusek Ro:
 <br>
The Kerran takeover!
 <Br>
This event is to take place on May the 1st 1999.
We`ll meet at 6 pm eastern time. (this will be 2 pm western time and 11 pm central european time!) Meeting point is the entrance of Kerra. (Don`t worry if you`re new on Erudin! There will be people collecting you from the Erudin port!)
 <br>
Our aim is to take over the Kerran Isle, which is situated near Erudin and populated by aggressive catlike beings. 
 <br>
For all dark races (ogres, trolls, darkelves etc.), there 
will be mages at the Erudin port who will cast invis on you, to avoid troubles with the guards.
 <br>
All players on Solusek Ro, every race, every class is hereby
invited to take part in this event! <b>(Please make sure you`re 
at least level 10 and higher!)</b>
 <br>
As soon as we reach Kerra, we will group up and sweep over
the isle and leave nothing behind than devastating chaos.
 <br>
Guides and mages will start waiting for incoming player groups from 5pm eastern time and will continue till 6 pm eastern time.
 <br>
best regards
 <br>
Naomi - Solusek Ro

There is a new voting poll up at the <a href="http://www.eqtrade.com">EQ Trade</a> board regarding race/class. This was sent to us from Shadowmaster:


<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
There is a new Voting at EQ Trade Board "Which race/class do you prefer ?"
There are more then 60 points !!! All variations of races/classes are presented !
Come everybody and vote for char you play and char you prefer !
<p>
I hope many players will take part in the voting (I'll try to let everyone know about it) and results will be interesting to absolutly all players.
We can dispute very long who is the best and whom it is preferable to play but to learn the real situation is interesting to everyone.
<p>
