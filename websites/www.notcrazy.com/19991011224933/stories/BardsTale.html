traveler.&nbsp; Sit and be welcome. Stay near the fire this eve
and enjoy some mulled wine and a tale&nbsp; of a
journey.&quot;&nbsp; The pudgy bard leans back onto the chair,
and with calm assurance says &quot; There has been a report of a
disturbance near the village of Qwilln.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">My
friends, let me, Taleisin, tell you the true tale...&quot;.</font>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">As the
wind rose from the peaks in the distance, the clouds overhead
began to shift. Away went the dark clouds and they were replaced
by the warming sun. Off in the distance, the forest loomed. A
dark feeling passed through Montibank's soul each and every time
that he glanced in that direction.. On the road ahead, a village
appeared. &quot;About time&quot; Monti mumbled to himself. It had
been a long week for Monti. He had been chasing a renegade
magician for weeks now. As he rode closer to the village, he
noted the outlying farms. The crops were ripening, the autumn
season was upon them. &quot;Just a little while longer old
friend&quot; he said to his mare as he rubbed her neck.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">A stranger
was coming. His heart quickened. &quot;Mama mama mama&quot;
Randle cried as he sprinted towards the front door. &quot;A man.
is coming&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Shar, the
townswoman, looked outside. A stranger indeed. She quickly wrote
a note on some parchment and told Randle to run to the mayors
house.&nbsp; Watching her son run, she bolted the windows and
barred the shutters. Then she went out back and rang the calling
bell. Her man Rello looked up.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;What
now&quot; moaned Rello as he heard the bell. &quot; She wants
another...&quot; He looked up and stopped in mid-sentance. She
was shutting the house up.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Must be
danger, he thought. Rello looked down the road. Seeing naught but
a man on horse, he wondered what the woman was being foolish
for.&nbsp;&nbsp; He quickly dipped his hands in the wash-water
barrel and went out to meet the man.</font> </p>

face="Comic Sans MS">he Mayor of Qwilln was drinking some apple
brandy in the tavern. He heard a commotion outside and wondered
what it was. The brandy looked more inviting, so he quelled his
urge to look and took another swallow of the fiery liquid.
&quot;Ahhh, Marsellos makes the best&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Jav
fancied himself as a guard. He could handle a sword without
cutting himself, and he was strong. Currently he was guarding the
tavern door,&nbsp; trying to let the mayor get some peace and
quiet. It wasn't his fault that some brat kid was screaming for
the mayor.&nbsp; So after a few minutes of looking mean and
trying to quiet the kid, he stormed inside the tavern.
&quot;Mayor&quot; he bellowed, slamming fist to chest. The mayor
winced, &quot;Mayor, this kid, Randle wants to speak with
you.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The mayor
motioned for the child to come closer.. &quot;Your Rello and Shar
Tralnic's child, ain't you?&quot; he questioned.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Randle
nodded, then without a word, handed the Mayor a piece of
parchment.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The Mayor
read the note, and called out to Jav. &quot;Get in here you
oaf..&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Jav,
inside the smoky tavern, and drinking some ale, spills it all
over himself in an attempt to drink it before answering the
mayor. &quot;Here</font> <br>
<font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">sir. &quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Gather
the men and meet me in the town square&quot; commanded the mayor.
Seeing Jav salute, he winced and motioned the man to go.
&quot;Now son, why don't you stay here.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Randle,
still silent, nodded again, and wandered into the kitchen. The
cook offered him some warm brown bread and Randle began to eat
it.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The mayor
watched as Rello and the stranger, walked towards the assembled
men. They seemed to be chatting amicably. The stranger slid off
his horse, and stretched his back.&nbsp; &quot; unh! &quot;&nbsp;
broke from his lips.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Rello said
&quot; Mayor, this is Gallin.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Monti
smiled at the perpetuation of his lie.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Gallin&quot;
asked the mayor. &quot;What is your business here?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;I am
just passing through, looking for a friend&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;What
friend might that be&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;A
master magician&quot; smiled Monti</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;He
be the one that the dwarves are looking for as well&quot; called
out a man. &quot;They paid me hard gold for information of
Magician Rashmar.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The mayor
turned in surprise, looking for the man who had spoken.
&quot;Culli, why didn't you tell us?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;T'was
only yesterday&quot; Culli called back, &quot; And ye know that
the Magi left late last night.&quot; the man justified.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">The mayor
turned white at the secret being so loosely thrown about.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;What
Dwarves&quot; spat Monti. &quot;Did the leader have red hair and
a black beard?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Not
thinking, Culli answered &quot; Aye&quot;.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Damn
that Hulf&quot; shouted Monti. &quot;Which way did they go?&quot;
he yelled at Culli.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Culli,
thinking to make a profit, came back with &quot; 10 gold and I
tell ya &quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Monti
moved faster than any of the villagers thought that a man could
move. Suddenly a knife was pressed into the soft flesh of Culli's
neck.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Tell
me or you die&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">Jav stared
for a second then pulled his sword and swung at the stranger. In
mid-swing, something hot penetrated his left eye. *<b>THUD*&nbsp;</b>
he fell to the ground.</font> </p>

<p><font  size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">&quot;Tell
me&quot; Monti screamed at Culli after dispatching Jav.</font> </p>
