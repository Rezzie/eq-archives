Those of us who have played Ultima Online (UO) know that nearly every
character in the game (aside from the various <i>mule</i> characters) is
what is called a <b>tank-mage</b>. A tank-mage is basically an expert
fighter who is also a high caliber magic-user. In UO, due to the flexible
nature of the skills system, all tank-mages wear plate mail, wield the most
powerful of weapons, and are quite capable of blasting people with
high-level spells.<BR><BR>

In EverQuest (EQ) this is not supposed to happen. According the designer,
Brad McQuaid, EQ will not be <i>over-run</i> by tank-mages. Most people I
know are pleased by this comment, as was I when I first heard it. But upon
reflection, I'm not so sure. Here is my argument in favor of the tank-mage.<BR><BR>

BTW: I am not an EQ Beta Tester. However, I have played D&D since 1977,
computer RPGs since Wizardry in 1984, and UO since 1997.<BR><BR>

<b>In praise of the Tank-Mage</b><BR>
<b>Flexibility</b>: The Tank-Mage (in UO) is the most flexible of
characters. The tank-mage is able to: fight and kill weak monsters with
weapons alone; fight and kill strong monsters with a combination of magic
spells and weapons, and is able to hold his (or her) own in groups facing
the most powerful monsters in the game (demons, dragons and PKers). Not
only that, but the tank-mage can heal wounds, cure poison, unlock chests,
and (most importantly) teleport around the entire world with the aid of
some rune stones.<BR><BR>

In effect, the tank-mage is very close to a demi-god. Personally, I like
playing a tank-mage. While I prefer melee combat, I have no objection to
casting the occasional spell or two. And, having walked to just about every
spot of land in UO, I much prefer teleporting (the spell is called Recall).
Walking (or running) in UO is slow, cumbersome, and very, very dull.<BR><BR>

<b>Time Invested = Good Rewards</b><BR>
The great thing about being a tank-mage is that the time you invest in your
character is well rewarded in the game. One could spend similar amounts of
time to become an expert cook, animal healer, carpenter, and lockpick, but
at the end of three months, which character is more fun to play? The
tank-mage or the character that must walk everywhere, avoid all monsters,
and generally do nothing exciting? The players in UO have voted (as it
were) and that is why you see tank-mages everywhere you look.

<b> Why Should I Specialize? </b><BR>
EQ is designed to encourage <b> specialization</b>. Fighters (with no
magical abilities), mages (with almost no fighting abilities), clerics (the
only ones with healing abilities), and thieves (the only ones with
lock-pick abilities) are all specialized characters. This is obviously
derived from the  classic game <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>. Now, I've
played more than a little D&D and I fully understand specialization. At
first glance, specialization <i>seems</i> to make sense. In the real world
that we live in, we are surrounded by specialized people (bankers, farmers,
police, firemen, web site designers, etc.).<BR><BR>

In the context of a group of people who get together as a group to play
D&D, specialization also makes sense (although we all know just how many
players actually played pure fighters vs. multi-class elven fighter-mages,
or paladins... damn few). However, in the world of EQ, I suggest that
specialization is NOT a good idea. Why?<BR><BR>

<b>The world of EQ does NOT have the consistency of the real world</b>. It does not even have the consistency of D&D games (at least the ones I'm familiar with). Instead, every time you log in to EQ you are faced with a world that may be completely hostile, or at best, neutral towards you. If you leave the <i>safety</i> of a town, you are almost certain to face any number of situations that call for: magical abilities, thief abilities,
ranger abilities, clerical abilities, and fighter abilities. The more of these abilities your character can master, the more capable you are of venturing forth into the world.<BR><BR>

But wait (you say), that is why you need to travel in <b>groups!</b> Groups
are fine and dandy but I know UO very well and I know just how hard it is
to get a group together to do anything remotely dangerous. And I belong to
a well organized, year-old guild! It still can take us upwards on 30
minutes to actually go into one of the dungeons. And remember: In UO,
<strong>every character is nearly the same!</strong> Try and imagine how
complex it will be to assemble a working group in EQ.<BR><BR>
<blockquote>
<i>The scene: A gathering place in a small town in EQ</i> <br>
Me: <b> OK, we need a fighter, a mage, a cleric, and a thief. </b><br>
Monday, 9:51 PM: You see 3 mages and 1 cleric. <br>
Tuesday 8:30 PM: You see 4 rangers, a paladin, and a mage. <br>
Wednesday 10:11 PM: You see 5 fighters.  <br>
Thursday 9:25 PM: You see 2 fighters, 1 ranger, and 3 thieves. <br>
Friday 8:45 PM: You see 4 fighters, 3 mages, 1 cleric, 1 thief, 1 monk, and
3 rangers. <br>
</blockquote><BR><BR>
On Friday (in my hypothetical example) there are enough people to form a
reasonable party, but not enough to form 2 parities. How does the group
form? What happens to the people <i>left out of the group?</i><BR><BR>

I can easily imagine spending an hour or more just getting a decent party
assembled so we can go outside the city. I can imagine being <i>stuck</i>
for an hour waiting (for example) for a thief to come by and help us with
traps & chests in a dungeon. This is NOT a fun prospect. Being part of a
guild is going to be more than just a good idea. Also I predict many guilds
will require guild members to play multiple characters of different types
so that when 15% of the guild is online, it still has a decent chance of
forming a reasonable group.<BR><BR>

Heaven help the players that don't belong to a guild. They will have to
rely on random pick-up teams like we saw in Diablo (BattleNet). Talk about
an adventure every time you log on... How would you like to be at the mercy
of some  teen-ager with serious emotional problems that just happens to
playing the only cleric within miles of your party? I'm really looking
forward to it myself. NOT!<BR><BR>

<b>The Solution: Tank Mages in EQ!</b> (well, sort of) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I predict that after a few weeks of trying out various character classes,
just about everyone playing EQ will settle on a character class (maybe two
or even three) that offers the most flexibility. This character class will
likely be some variation on the tank-mage. At this time, I predict a glut
of: Shadow Knights (tank-mages), Paladins (tank-clerics), and Rangers
(tank-druids).<BR><BR>

I know Brad McQuaid has said this isn't happening in the beta. My response
is: the real game won't be like the beta. In the beta, people are MUCH more
willing to try out different things. When the real game starts, people's
willingness to devote hundreds of hours to a very specialized character
class will be just about zero. I am sure there will be more variation than
we see in UO, but I don't think it is going to be very different from UO.<BR><BR>

I don't think it is a bad thing. I do think it is a case where everyone can
make a decision, and everyone ends up making the same decision. In the real
world, everyone can't be a lawyer or a doctor, even though they are highly
desireable professions. In EQ, nothing (that I'm aware of) stops every
player from choosing to be a Troll Shadow Knight (based on what Brad has
said, this is one powerful dude). If that provides the most power and
flexibility, I suspect that a large majority will play this character class.<BR><BR>

I welcome reasoned debate and argument. Flames and invective will be ignored.<BR><BR>
