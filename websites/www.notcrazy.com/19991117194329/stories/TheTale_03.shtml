<b><i>Chapter 3: Time to Train</b></i><BR><BR>

<p>Argmen rubbed his shoulder as his last opponent hit the ground, exhausted.  The town healer quickly came over and helped replenish the mans strength somewhat by allowing him to drink the contents of a silver goblet.</p>

<p>"Good spar sir!" Argmen called out to the man.  </p>

<p>The man wheezed a bit and stood up, "aye sir...good spar to you too.  However, I think I'll leave the position for another day."  With that the man bowed graciously to Argmen, hacked a few more times and stumbled away.</p>

<p>Argmen drove his massive blade into the ground and swept his hair back.  His eyes squinted as the sun made it's way through the sky, a drop of sweat rolled down his cheek and onto the ground.  The trees in the forest where he was taking the spars were providing some shade, though the moisture in the air was definitely uncomfortable.  He took a last look around him to see if there was anyone left, seeing none he pulled his two-hander from the soil and began to walk back to town, just when someone got his attention.</p>

<p>"Sir wait!" The voice called out.  </p>

<p>Argmen turned around and smiled, feeling glad his workout wasn't over yet.  That's when he saw Thorn.  "Can I help you lad?"  Argmen said, leaning on his sword.</p>

<p>Thorn came to a stop and wiped his forehead and bent forward, resting his hands on his knees,  "Gads it's hot, aye...I'm here for the position of Warrior Unit Leader..if it's still open that is."</p>

<p>Argmen chuckled lightly and approached him, "ahhh yes...the position is still open.  By the looks of things it might stay that way for awhile, planning on changing all that Mr....?"</p>

<p>Thorn stood himself upright and said boldly, "Rolinthorn...Rolinthron Tillen, most call me Thorn.  And yes I am planning on changing all that as you put it.  So, what are the rules and stipulations, eh?"</p>

<p>Argmen wiped another droplet of sweat from his eye and spoke in return, "the rules are...anything goes.  Magic if you wish but since this is a warrior position you must prove yourself a worthy user of a weapon.  Don't worry about not giving all you've got, I've personally hired a healer if things get too rough.  I myself don't believe in using magic so I'll stake my honor on this."  Argmen quickly spun the sword, easily Thorn's height in length, around both his forearms and took a firm grip, letting it regain it's original position.  "So...are you ready?"  Argmen was ready for this day, he was fully outfitted in his hauberk armor, a simple string kept his hair out of his face.</p>

<p>"Aye..."  Thorn passed a hand through the air, soon after a shape began to form from the air itself.  After a moment it solidified and rested in his hand.  To the eye, he had just made a broadsword from nothing.</p>

<p>Argmen looked impressed and nodded to him, "very good...now then, let's get to it!"  With that he raised his weapon over his head and charged Thorn.  His blade flew with immaculate speed, however it's intended target was no longer there.  With nothing holding it back the blade tore through the trunk of a huge tree, sending splintered wood flying this way and that.  Argmen turned around looking for Thorn, not paying attention to the tree as it crashed down behind him.</p>

<p>His teeth gritted and his brow lowered, "most impressive, I have not seen anyone yet move with such speed!"  He continued to look from side to side for the dispatched Thorn.</p>

<p>Argmen's eyes were fixed, but suddenly to him it seemed like time had stopped as he took a deep breath in, his eyes widened and he felt all of the strength leave from his left hand as it fell useless beside him.  It all seemed to be in slow motion, he looked down to see a dagger piercing his elbow all the way through, rendering his left arm completely useless.</p>

<p>"I never moved..."  </p>

<p>It was Thorns voice...and so close.  "What!"  Argmen shouted, looking further to his left he saw an almost completely translucent humanoid form.  He began to snarl, but quickly his growl became somewhat of a chuckle.  With only his right hand he tossed his weapon into the air and in one fluid motion brought his right arm around coming straight in contact with the almost invisible Thorn.  Thorn's camouflage spell quickly wore off as he slid several feet on the grassy earth before coming to a stop.  </p>

<p>Even with his eyes completely on Thorn, Argmen opened his right hand and let the two-hander drop into it.  He took a moment to look back down at his left arm, the dagger still protruding from it.  He was amazed, it had gone straight through his armor.  "I've never seen such a thing before, I hope you have a few more tricks, this is the first good fight I've had all day!"  Argmen roared and brought his sword back up into an attack position with one arm.  He knew he was strong, but using a two-handed sword made for someone his size with one hand was definitely going to slow him down.</p>

<p>"Great heavens"  Thorn spoke to himself wavering a bit as he stood.  "It is true sir, you are strong, but I DO infact have a few more tricks up my sleeve."  He lifted his sword up and struck it into the ground as hard as he could.  The force caused a huge ripple in the ground that began hurling it's way toward Argmen.</p>

<p>"At this distance I can't win, I must get closer"  Argmen thought to himself.  He watched as the ripple headed toward him and hefted his blade up and slammed it into the ground, kneeling behind it.  The sword tore through the rock as it came toward Argmen, leaving him only moderately nicked on his shoulders.</p>

<p>When he saw the earth ripple was over, he lifted his head back up and wrenched his sword back from the ground, rushing as quickly as possible toward Thorn.  Thorn was not quick enough with his newest spell and he was forced to fight Argmen head to head.  Even with one arm Argmen was more then making up for it with violent, pounding attacks upon Thorn. </p>

<p>Thorn was managing to deflect most of them, but he could hear his sword crack and strain each time it came in contact with Argmen's.  Soon Argmen's sword blasted through Thorns and stuck deep into the ground as it continued it's downward swing.  </p>

<p>Quickly Thorn grabbed hold of the dagger in Argmen's elbow and began twisting it.  </p>

<p>Argmen grunted in response, his eyes popped wide open.  He let go of his sword, leaving it in the ground and grabbed Thorn by the neck, bringing him to the ground with one arm.  Breathing heavily he spoke, "Ok...that's enough...the position is yours."  He slowly let go of Thorns neck and walked over to the healer.  As he drank out of the goblet he almost crushed it in his hand as he's bones popped back into place, the wound quickly mended itself.</p>

<p>****************************************************************************</p>

<p>Amalion sat quietly on his cliff, high above the crashing waves of the sea.  He was sitting, eyes closed, in somewhat of a meditative state.  He faced the ocean and before him was a glowing blue ball of light about 1 foot in diameter.  It crackled and pulsed as electric-like energy twisted around it.  All of Amalion's concentration was on sphere, he was completely oblivious to his surroundings.</p>

<p>That's when a form poked it's head up from the brush behind him.  Slowly, quietly it made it's way to him from behind. Amalion's heightened senses felt this immediately, but he strained to keep his concentration on the orb, for he knew the consequences if he lost his concentration.</p>

<p>It began to walk closer, very very slowly.  He couldn't quite tell what it could be as of yet.</p>

<p>Amalion felt his mind ringing out, "gah blasted, please just go away...anytime but now!"</p>

<p>He could almost feel it coming closer, soon it would be right up next to him.</p>

<p>Once again he thought to himself, "Just turn around!  Must...keep...focus...."</p>

<p>As soon as it put it's hand on his shoulder he felt his concentration leave him completely.</p>

<p>"NO!!  Elemental Deflection!"  He pushed both his hands at the orb and an unseen force sent it over the cliff.  Quickly he got to his feet and tackled the being onto the ground, not to hurt it but to protect it from what was about to happen.</p>

<p>"Keep down!"  He exclaimed loudly.  After those words were spoken a huge blast erupted from the water, tearing away half of the rock at the base of the cliff and sending water up a good hundred and fifty feet, drenching them both.</p>

<p>"Gah..."  his breathing was erratic.  When he looked up he saw what had caused him all this distraction.  It was a young female...</p>
