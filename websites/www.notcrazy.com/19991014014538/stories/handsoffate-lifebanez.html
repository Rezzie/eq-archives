<BR>Peering through the darkness with bleary eyes.  I wince from the harsh
blow that morning sun brings.  Who.. Where am I?  A desk, writing table,
and a chest of drawers line the walls of this room.  Oh yeah, I am in my
friend Robin’s room at the inn.  It appears that I drank more then I
could handle the night before.  A man named Dragoth entered our town
claiming to be a soothsayer.  This man said that he had vision us our
little town being attacked by brigands in the following days.  His
vision gave your small militia enough time to raise a suitable defense
against the attackers, and with minimal casualties.  For striking down
four men with my long bow I was awarded a finely crafted Morning star
from the smithy shop.<BR><BR>

My head was still shaking from the celebration last night.  When I
exited in the room still wearing little clothing on my back, the barkeep
greeted me.  "Hail fair LifeBanez!  What a glorious yesterday night
was." The barkeep gave me two eggs and some bread on the house and I
thanked him.  I collected my morning star and bow from the armor and
lumbered out of the old oak inn.  I hear a shrill plead for help.  I
whip out my new bludgeon and run to the closest back alley, from
which I heard the call for help.  Two men clad in rags and wielding
knives were above an old woman, and one more was closer to me with a
sling in his hand, ready to let loose the stone.  I quickly brang down
my morning star upon his back, and followed through revealing only his
bare spinal column.  All the flesh was torn onto my mace, and one swift
kick to his unprotected back send his body crashing to the ground.  One
of the thieves ran for cover screaming, "Let’s get the hell outta here!"
The last thief dropped his blade and began quivering on his knees.  The
vulnerable old woman picked up her purse and send the thief unconscious
with one strike across the face.<BR><BR>

For dragging the thief to the county jail I was rewarded with two gold
coins, which could feed me for the next couple weeks.  I walked towards
the guild house of a rich family that was hiring mercenaries and men of
arms to guard the streets of Farann with force.  I stepped inside and
gazed at the wooden board.  Posted here were various tasks that people
could do for a couple of gold coins.  In the corner of the board I found
a piece of paper that read:<BR><BR>

<I><B><center>WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE</b><BR>
Three Vagabond rouges that stole from the<BR>
innocent and vulnerable<BR>
These three brothers are new to Farann<br>
streets and need to be taught a lesson<BR>
Inquire at county jail.<BR></i></center><BR><BR>

I ripped the sign from the pin that held it there and threw it into the
garbage bin.  Something caught my eye.  Another note on the board that
said Mistress Pol was captured outside the north gate by an organized
band of brigands.  A ransom note was found at the site of the abduction
and it said to inquire at the Prince’s manor house.  A hefty reward was
also offered that could probably let me live well for the next half
year.  I strolled up to the top of a high hill, and found the large
manor house.  Bronze statues of lions lined the battlements of this
small keep.  I knocked twice on the doors and waited for a response.
The large gate opened and a man dressed in fine clothing hailed me.  "I
am here to inquire about Mistress Pol", said I.  The man led me into a
circular room.  At the head of a table was another man dressed in fine
clothes, a woman wearing a leather bustier, and two other men who were
carrying adventurer’s equipment.  The butler pulled me out a red leather
chair and I took a seat with the rest of my fellows.  A map was sprawled
upon the table and what looking to be the ransom note was posted
adjacent to my host.  We all met, and talked a great deal about what
happened and what to do about it.  Mandor, the host, had his sister,
Mistress Pol captured by a band of rouges.  Mandor read us the ransom
note. "To whomever it may concern.  We have taken this beauty to our
camp currently north of the local borders and the only way to get her
back is to deliver a sack full of gold to the camp.  When our demands
are met this fine lady will be delivered safely into the hands of her
peers."  Mandor hired Juli, Randon, Peroc, and I to somehow bring back
Mistress Pol without giving away any gold.  We all agreed to the
challenge and split up to buy supplies for our trek.<BR><BR>

I spend my last gold coin on rations, a bedroll, a shinny new dagger,
and some new arrows.  The others were going to meet me at the north gate
at dusk, and we would trek as far as we could during the night.  I was
on my way to meet up with my partners when the local apothecary stood
dead in my tracks.  She was a young woman with long blond hair and blue
eyes.  I couldn’t help but stare at her figure.  "I have heard of your
brave journey fair sir, and I wish to help you on your way."  I promptly
agreed and entered her cottage.  Inside was the fresh smell of various
herbs, reagrents, and other plants that made up her business.  A shelf
case was lined with mixtures of various colors and contained in queer
bottles.  She handed me one of them from off of her shelf and gave me a
small kiss on the cheek.  "The orange one will cure most poisons and
curses".  "Thank you greatly" was all that came out of my mouth.
Placing the potion into my backpack, I realized where the time had gone
and I merrily walked towards the northern gate.  The other adventurers
were waiting for me, and when I reached within talking distance they
started to complain about being late.  I waved it off, and we started
our long journey.

We calculated that the most reasonable place that the brigands would
be, outside of the town, was a large clearing behind a mountain pass
about five hours due north.  When we reached the head of the path dawn
was pushing towards the sky.  We made a small fire and slept until noon
the next day.  Before the others awoke I got to take a good look at my
company.  Juli was the female in our party.  She wielded an ancient
weapon called a scamerand that looked like a boomerang, but had
armor-piercing blades in the tips.  Peroc was stalky and muscular.  He
held a massive two-handed battle-axe that most men would have trouble
lifting.  At first glance Randon held no weapon.  A small pouch was tied
to his belt and the only protection offered was a flowing white robe.
The more my eyes searched I revealed two long daggers protruding under
the sleeves of Randon’s robe.  It appears that his main defense was
these two daggers so concealed.<BR><BR>

When everyone awoke, we set our coarse and headed directly through the
mountain pass, watching out for possible ambush sites, and being
cautious not to make to much noise.  When we curved along the
mountainside we started to watch out for guard post and places we could
be seen.  Inching along the trees and foliage alongside the mountain,
our stealth soon paid off.  A well-concealed tent was hidden among
several oak trees.  Two men in worn out leather armor stood guard on the
mountain pass both holding crossbows.  We did not want to fight the
whole camp, just find Mistress Pol and get her out without a
confrontation.  We found our way through the bushes and trees and
eventually found the main camp.  From where I could see, there were
several large tents and one tent that looking ft for a king.  Several
guards were patrolling both this and a small tent beside it.  We assumed
the large tent houses the leader of these brigands and the small one
contained Mistress Pol, their prisoner.  We decided to wait until
nightfall before attempting anything daring.  Setting up camp without
anyone knowing was not easy.  No fire could be made for safety’s sake,
and all we had to warm ourselves was a bedroll and the clothes on our
back.  A while after the sun went down, we peered through the brush and
began to plan how we would get Pol, and how we would escape.<BR><BR>

Juli was the first to come up with the plan.  She shifted her weapon to
one side of her body and began moving slowly towards the end of her
tent.  She told Randon and I to stay put and asked Peroc for
assistance.  The lumbering hulk walk slowly behind Juli with his
battle-axe still strapped to his back.  Juli stood at the back of the
tent with her razor sharp scamerand in hand.  She used the blade of her
weapon to slice a piece of the tent wall, and making her own entrance.
Juli motioned for Peroc to go inside the tent.  Everything was going
along smoothly so far.  Peroc emerged from the tent with the limp form
of a woman atop his shoulder.  Apparently Mistress Pol had been drugged
so that escape would not be possible alone.  Suddenly I heard a loud
shout, "HALT! Guards! The prisoner is escaping!"  Juli and Peroc
sprinted to where we stood and handed me Mistress Pol.  Half of the
brigand camp was now awake and chasing after us.  At this rate I knew we
would never get away.  I saw the look in Peroc’s eyes.  He was born for
battle and his stalky figure showed it.  He unlatched the double bladed
axe from his back and began swinging it above his head.  Never in my
life have I seen someone gone as mad in battle as Peroc.  With that
large axe above his head he lobbed off arms, legs, and anything else
that got in the way of his fury.  At least six or seven brigands fell to
that axe that day before Peroc met his fate under the combined force of
twenty or so people.  Now I realized why Peroc had done that.  He gave
us enough time to escape this place unnoticed while they were busy with
him.  He sacrificed his life for ours.<BR><BR>

When ran as hard as we could, but some of the brigands had horses, and
carrying an unconscious woman on your shoulder is not easy.  Just as one
of the horse rider’s came close to lobbing off my head with his sword I
saw my fellow Randon murmuring in a slow chant.  The horseman tried to
strike his blade at me again with renewed vigor.  This time, his blade
not only missed, but at the same time, a large ball of burning flame
flew from Randon’s hands and barely missed my face.  The ball of fire
flew into the outstretched arms of my pursuer and we kept on running.
Several of our followers on horsemen turn and fled when they saw that.
Between me carrying the woman, Juli throwing her weapon, and Randon
shooting balls of flame at the oncoming horsemen, we were able to make
it within the boundaries of a guard post.  We ran inside with horsemen
close on our backs.  We informed the patrolling guards that some
brigands would be fast upon us and they took up arms.  A large halberd
and full plate armor made these guards fierce opponents.  I saw the
guards take out most of the horsemen with their halberd before the
brigands even got close.  "We are safe!" Juli shouted.  We heard a cry
of torment which we though to be the enemy band that had been massacres
by the guards.  When we peered over the guard post, there was a lone
horsemen standing beside the corpses of the two guards.  It was a female
with a bow slung across her should, she was plucking out the arrows from
the guard’s chests and placing them back in her quiver.  This woman was
obviously the leader of these brigands and we all agreed must be dealt
with.  Such skill with a bow was greater then mine, and I knew my arrows
probably couldn’t penetrate such thick armor.  Juli took action and ran
down the battlements to fight this woman strait on.  Juli was not quick
enough.  One shot from the mysterious woman’s bow sent Juli grasping her
leg on the ground.  Randon performed his magic while I sent arrows
shooting in the air towards our foe.  My arrows bounced harmlessly
around her horse’s feat, and I could see a trickle of sweat coming from
Randon’s forehead.  He was obviously performing some great feat.  And
then he was gone.  Randon had disappeared before my very eyes.  At first
I though Randon to be a coward, but when I saw him appear again behind
the enemy and gouge her right arm with a dagger I knew I was wrong.  Our
archer enemy held her bleeding arm and galloped away with full speed.<BR><BR>

We put Mistress Pol’s still limp body in a cot inside the guard’s post,
and quickly rushed to the aid of Juli.  She was still clutching her leg
and appeared in great pain.  She tried to break a smile and speak but
nothing came out.  We realized that the arrow’s head had been coated in
a serious toxin that came from a local beat called a Lisk.  These
creatures could be milked of their toxin at birth and was used as guard
dogs.  I knew no normal means could restore Juli’s health and that she
would probably die soon.  I then realized that I had a potion for just
such toxins that the apothecary gave me.  I just hoped it would work.
Juli smeared the potion over the wound and silently fell to sleep.  I
carried Pol the rest of the way home and Randon used his magic to carry
Juli.  Back in the town, I had my healer friend slowly nurse Juli and
Mistress Pol back to health.  The reward given for the safe return of
Pol was hefty.  We each gave half of our gold to hire another group of
adventurers to seek out and finish off this band of deadly
troublemakers.  Pol was thankful for her return, but we all grieved for
the loss of our comrade in arms, Peroc.<BR><BR>
