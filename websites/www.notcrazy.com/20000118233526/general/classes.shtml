</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Warrior</B></font><BR>
Warriors are the masters of armed combat, in all its many forms. They are at home on the battlefield, and are trained to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their Hit Points are the highest of any class.

</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Cleric</B></font><BR>
The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath of his deity to smite his foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains his ability.

</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Paladin</B></font><BR>
Paladins are the very picture of a holy knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of his life. They share some of the power of a Cleric, and a good deal of the fighting ability of a Warrior, but have a few powers all their own.

</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Ranger</B></font><BR>
The Ranger is a meld between a Warrior and a Druid, sharing some of the skills of both. They are at home in the outdoors.

</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Shadow Knight</B></font><BR>
The evil twin to the Paladin class, Shadow Knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods whom they serve. They are a meld of Warrior and Necromancer, and share some of their abilities and spells. 
</td>

<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/druid.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Druid</B></font><BR>
A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors, and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid. They are spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers.

<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/monk.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Monk</B></font><BR>
Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this they nearly shun all weapons and most forms of armor. They are very religious as well, and the gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks. 
</td>

<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/bard.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Bard</b></font><BR>
The Bard’s stock-in-trade is his ability to play songs. His songs are actually spells of a sort, and their magical affects last as long as the Bard continues to sing and play the correct instrument. They have some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main focus is always their art, and so they will never be as skillful as Warriors. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/rogue.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Rogue</B></font><BR>
They are the secretive, mysterious class of the world, who sneak about in the dark. Some say they are assassins, and some that they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere in the middle, and they are capable of both. They are quite skilled with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to toe with a Warrior and prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. They would much prefer to not be discovered at all, or if they are, to not be there for their opponent’s blow to land. The darker skills of picking locks and stealing are also their forte.

<tr>
<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/shaman.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<Font size=+1><B>Shaman</b></font><BR>
They are similar to the Cleric, but are more of a tribal witch doctor and are typically found amongst the more primitve races. Their primary focus is largely healing and other Clerical type spells, but they also have a good deal of offensive spells. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/necromancer.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Necromancer</B></font><BR>
These are the dark brotherhood of the arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based spells, they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from their victims. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/wizard.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Wizard</b></font><BR>
Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge, and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rivals. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/magician.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><b>Magician</B></font><br>
Magicians are the summoners of the arcane arts, and wield the power to call forth everything from a loaf of bread to a huge Fire Elemental to fight for them. While not as adept at offensive spells as the Wizards, Magicians still wield considerable power in this area as well. 
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/classes/enchanter.html"><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/bullet.gif" height=19 width=19 border=0>
</td>
<td>
<font size=+1><B>Enchanter</b></font><BR>
The primary focus of the Enchanter’s art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which he belongs: Enchanter. Their spells are crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard.
