<BR>

To start off, here are the specs of the system on which the comparisons have been made. Also please keep in mind that EverQuest is still in CLOSED BETA, many of my qualms both ways are still being worked on, and do not necessarily reflect the way thigns will be in the final version of the game.<BR><BR>

<b>Processor:</b> Pentium II 448<BR>
<b>Ram:</b> 64 MB PC100<BR>
<b>Motherboard:</b> Asus P2B-LS (onboard Network & SCSI)<BR>
<b>Video Card:</b> STB Velocity 4400 (Riva TNT 16 MB)<BR>
<b>Voodoo Card:</b> STB BlackMagic (Voodoo2 12MB)<BR>
<b>Sound Card:</b> Sound Blaster Live!<BR><BR>

<b><i>Avalible Drivers:</b></i><BR>
In Everquest, if you have a voodoo card, there are three possible drivers in which you can use to play the game, First off, you have your primary display driver (the TNT in this case), you also have the two voodoo2 drivers: Voodoo2 Glide driver, and Voodoo2 DirectX 6 Driver. (directX version may also be v. 5).<BR><BR>

<b><i>Visual Quality:</b></i><BR>
There is little to no visual quality improvement in the game between the Voodoo2 glide driver and the voodoo2 DirectX 6 driver, although the framerate on the Glide driver is higher. The RivaTNT Driver Displays more colors, giving a less "dithered" effect over the Voodoo Drivers, and also gives a much crisper, cleaner image.<BR><BR>

<b><i>Performance:</b></i><BR>
Both of the two Voodoo Drivers tend to choke and slow down whenever a magical spell effect is created. This drop in framerate is far more noticeable with "fire" style spell effects than other effects. The TNT handles magic effects very well, and there is little to no drop in performance when a magical effect is used, even the "fire" effects. In all three drivers, however, performance is quite slow when you first load up a zone, and continues to be a little slow until all of the textures have been loaded into the cards memories. The way I discovered to avoid this problem is, the moment you load up a zone, turn completely around one or two times, this loads all of the textures into momory right off the bat, and you dont have to worry about drops in 
framerate due to the loading of a texture into memory. This tactic works with all three of the drivers.<BR><BR>

<b><i>Advantages:</b></i><BR>
<b>Voodoo2:</b> 989Studios tends to be concentrating mainly on the 3DFX chipset for its 3D acceleration. While the Voodoo2 tends to be a bit slower, it allows for higher resoloutions to be displayed. 800x600 with a single card and up to 1024x768 in SLI mode. <BR>
<b>RivaTNT:</b> The TNT displays more colors, and gives a crisper, cleaner image than the Voodoo2. The TNT also has a faster overall framerate, and also has less drops in framerate when different effects are used. <BR><BR>

<b><i>Disadvantages:</b></i><BR>
<b>Voodoo2:</b> Displays less colors than the TNT, making the image look "dithered", and not quite as real. The V2 also has a bit of a problem displaying some of the magical effects. These effects drop the framerate quite a bit, and this drop in framerate continues until the effect is over. <BR>
<b>RivaTNT:</b> My only real grudge with the TNT is that at this point in time the only supported resoloution is 640x480. 989Studios has said that they hope to have in support for higher resoloutions by the release of the game. And while they have not yet made any gaurantees that higher resoloutions will be supported, they say that they will eventually support higher resoloutions.<BR><BR>

<b><i>Overall Reccomendation:</i></b><BR>
Even though the TNT only supports 640x480 at this time within Everquest, I would still have to reccomend going with the TNT. Even when compared to a V2 in 800x600, the visual quality of the TNT still wins over. But, if you absoloutely MUST have higher resoloutions RIGHT NOW, then go with a voodoo2 SLI configuration. But if/once 989 gets in support for higher resoloutions for D3D drivers, the TNT will definitely be the clearest choice.
