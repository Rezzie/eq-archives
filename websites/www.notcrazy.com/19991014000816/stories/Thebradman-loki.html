Once upon a midnight dreary, as I surfed, I formed a query,
so designed, I made this query, with a thought of days of yore.
As I typed, my eyes did blur, my finger slipped, I later learned,
later learned that in my haste I typed a double character.
In my clumsiness, with tired blood, I had meant to search for "MUD", 
I hit enter, and quickly noticed, that my search had been "MMUD".
Only this, and nothing more.<BR><BR>

My modem lit, my hard drive churned, my screen lit up, my eyes - they burned,
my screen turned white and showed a list, "Damn that typo", I swore.
I grabbed my mouse, to dump this list, I was tired, I was pissed!
Pissed so was I, my eyes did cross, and caught an item on the list.
I looked upon, the wayward list, it was large with many hits,
Item three, it seemed to gleam, with a high hit count: 98% fidelity.
I had not known that this query, would return with something more. 
It read, "EverQuest" and nothing more.<BR><BR>

As my weariness began to fade, I clicked the link, and opened the page,
My screen turned black, and began to fill, to show me there was something more.
Soft colors and old English letters, greeted eyes with something better,
better so, than the cold, First Person Shooter or MUDs of old.
I clicked upon, each bright red link, and suddenly, began to think,
think there was a way to go, back into the days of yore.
Perhaps, "EverQuest" and nothing more.<BR><BR>

I was alive! I could not sleep! Five large continents, and oceans deep!
Beyond what text could help envision, I could not wait to explore.
But wait I must, I was told, that the game, must unfold
so that it may, become the best and become the game that breaks the mold.
And so I found a little-known board, where gathered such, a gruesome hoard
of people with desires like mine, and folks that could barely wait for more.
A board for "EverQuest", and nothing more.<BR><BR>

I heard of SISA and a guy named Brad (who must certainly be a charming lad :),
who wrote the story, in detailed form, and even approves the musical score.
He attended chats, and answered much, about gameplay, roleplay, dragons and such,
but at times I thought, he macroed that line, "I cannot comment at this time."
As I wait, the weeks go by, slowly at that, I can't deny, waiting for something more.
I wait for "EverQuest" and nothing more.<BR><BR>

It's now June, and I wait with wonder, thoughts of duels, great wars, and plunder,
Pirate boats upon the sea, for which they endeavor to explore.
But mostly now I wait for test, will I be chosen? Will I be best? 
Will I be given the chance to see what lies beyond the mystery?
Had I thought before, this could have been a great App, it would put me on the map
Perhaps my app is on top of the heap, perhaps it's buried thousands deep.
Either way I do not know, if I could be, in for more.<BR><BR>

In my dreams I answer the phone, the man on the other end tells me what's in store:
Quoth the Bradman, "You're on board".<BR><BR>
