<P><B><I>Chapter Two: Recruiting Begins...</i></b></p>

<P>Amalion exited the meeting hall, walking down the rocky street.  He had not gotten the time to braid his hair that morning, so the long locks flowed past his shoulders and fluttered gently in the warm breeze.  He began to think of what would be expected from him, he was in a militia now, not only that but a Unit Leader.  He wasn't even very disciplined and his cousin wanted him to be a Unit Leader.</p>

<P>"Curse my luck" he said to himself, stopping near the town square and looked up at the massive stone statue.  It was a person on a horse, one hand being used as a visor for his eyes, as if the bright sun was just ahead of him, and the other hand was on the horses reins.  He looked at the ground and sighed, shaking his head slowly.  Then he picked his head up and remembered, Oryis!  He had to contact Oryis!  He quickly passed a finger over the tarnished old ring on his left hand and closed his eyes.  Using his mind he called out for Oryis, finally he was answered as a picture of Oryis opened in front of him.  He opened his eyes and could see him in a meditative position in a quiet spot in the forest.</p>

<P>"Amalion my brother!  How have you been?  It has been long, no?  Are you well?"  Oryis' voice rang, that was his brother all right, just as cheerful as ever.  A bright smile was on his face, his eyes shined.</p>

<P>He concentrated and began to send his thoughts again, "Hello Oryis, I'm quite distressed actually.  Argmen just made me a Unit Leader for the Mage Division of our militia."</p>

<P>Oryis quickly answered, "Distressed?  Whatever for!  Unit Leader what an honor I mean wow!  But...why did they make you a Unit Leader of the militia?   I know you hate military work and I thought Bellente had a militia already."</p>

<P>"Well...there is talk of an attack on the city, by an army much larger then we've ever taken on before.  We still need a Warrior Unit Leader and a Healer Unit Leader...that's where I thought you would come in.  I was wondering if you would accept the position of the Healers Unit Leader."  Amalion grinned slightly, knowing his brother could not possibly pass this up.</p>

<P>Instead his brother frowned and Amalion got a bad feeling in his gut.  "Brother...I am sorry but..."  Oryis was then interrupted by a loud howl in back of him, soon a man came rushing toward him.  He ran, jumps, flipped and half twisted in air and landing right in front of Oryis, facing Amalion, smiling at him.  Amalion saw the green cloak, dark green tunic, leather belt, pouches, and boots, and a hand fashioned type of strangely armored pants, scales going up and down it's length.  At once he knew it was Rolinthorn, or Thorn as most everyone called him.  He too was a Sylvan, a Sylvan Ranger.  </p>

<P>Amalion slapped himself on the forehead, his eyes widened, "Oryis!  You're still hanging around with this lunatic!  Gah, Thorn you blasted pest get outta the way!"</p>

<P>Thorn chuckled and slapped his knee, "You need to lighten up Amalion, everyone needs to have alittle fun from time to time..."  He chuckled again, "of course, some more then others!".</p>

<P>As Thorn continued to laugh he moved out of the way to bring Oryis back into view, he spoke "oh come now brother, he is a good man.  He can be eccentric from time to time but he's no scoundrel.  As I was saying it is much to my sorrow that I cannot take the position of Unit Leader.  I am currently on a quest, and to forfill this quest my powers have temporarily been stripped from me, again I am sorry."</p>

<P>Amalion sighed disappointedly and had gotten ready to speak again but was interrupted by Thorn.</p>

<P>"Hey!  I heard that!  Open positions for the militia, and a warrior position nonetheless!  I'll be on my way right away!"</p>

<P>Amalion quickly answered, "Oh, no!  Umm...you should stay there, this is gonna be a big war, lots of people getting hurt.  I mean you don't even come to this town that much and there's no compensation for being in the militia."  He tried as best he could to keep him as far away from himself as he could, but to no avail.</p>

<P>"Nonsense!  I don't need any compensation, I'll be more then happy to take the position for nothing."</p>

<P>"Oh?" Began Amalion, "and what makes you so sure you'll get the position?"</p>

<P>Thorn began to chuckle heartily again, "After I show um what I got, how could they possibly pass up my offer?"</p>

<P>Amalion could think of several reasons, but common decency prohibited him from saying anything about Thorn's last comment.  "Fine...I suppose I can't blasted stop you, if you embarrass yourself it's not my fault."</p>

<P>Thorn bellowed with laughter after that, "oh gods alive!  Maybe you've a sense of humor after all Amalion!  I'm on my way!"  With that he gave Oryis a pat on the back, turned on his heel and sped off into the distance toward Bellente, kicking up leaves and dirt in his path.</p>

<P>Amalion shook his head and looked to his brother, "wonderful...can we trust that overgrown child?"</p>

<P>Oryis smiled and stretched his arms over his head, looking up to the sun starting to come up over the mountains, "my brother, you can trust him just as much as you can trust the sun to come up tomorrow morning."</p>

<P>Amalion also looked up at the sun, peaking through the hilltops, then he turned back to his brother, "I hope you're right...I'll talk to you later, Oryis"</p>

<P>Oryis waved to him, "until then brother!"  He passed his finger over the ring on his hand and his image was cut off from Amalions view.</p>

<P>Amalion took one last look at the statue, then back down to the ground. "Well...I suppose I better begin training.  I'll haveta be in the best condition possible, and I have to get there in one month."  He clenched his fist and began concentrating.  Soon whirling wisps of energy began to encircle his fist, howling like banshees.  He then drew his arm back and hurled the energy into the air.  It soared several hundred feet and exploded in a shower of multicolored sparks that dissipated before they hit the ground.  "Not bad...but I shall improve..."  He began to walk toward the city gates to exit the town and practice his magery elsewhere so he wouldn't disturb anyone.  It was also at this time he had began wondering how many people Argmen had beaten by now.  20?  30?  It made him chuckle just to think about what Argmen would do to Thorn.</p>
