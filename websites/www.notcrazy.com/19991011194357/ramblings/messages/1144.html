I see so many people ask totally stupid questions that I just assume that everyone is asking before trying. One additional idea is that it is a charged item like the Squad Ring and that you need to take it in for recharging. By the way, where did you get this item. I live in Riverval and talk to everyone and never got this quest as a Druid.
