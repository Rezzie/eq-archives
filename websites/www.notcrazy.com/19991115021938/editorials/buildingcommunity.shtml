	First off, I would like to thank everyone for the positive response on my last editorial, Avoiding a Catastrophe. In this editorial I would like to discuss what, to me, can make or break an online RPG... community.<BR><BR>
	What exactly is community? Well, community is the overall interaction between the players of a game. Why is community so important you may ask? Simply put, after a player has explored the entire gaming world, tried all there is to try, and achieved just about everything they want to achieve the only thing left keeping them playing is community. If there is no bonds between players, then one quickly gets bored with the game and moves on. So, what exactly makes up a community? That part is a little harder. In my experience with online RPGs(Ultima Online, The Realm, and various MUDs) I have seen a wide array of community structures. I have seen very weak ties, such as in Ultima Online, and very strong ones, such as those in certain MUDs. What I have seen has helped me draw a conclusion as to what things are fundamental to building a community and those things which can destroy it.<BR><BR>
	Let me start out with Ultima Online. Ultima Online has(or had) the potential to be a classic. The idea behind it was brilliant and even the game wasn't too bad. What killed Ultima Online was it's community, or lack thereof. Quickly running through Britain told a lot about the game. Instead of having the taverns and inns filled with people, the hot spot of activity was the Britain Bank. Theives, NPCs, and powergamers alike crowded the area around the bank. Begging for a few gold coins would sparce get a response, while yelling out "Anyone got a <insert item here>? I am willing to pay x gold," would end up with you being swamped. Greed was the name of the game in UO. The only thing that really mattered was how many grandmaster titles you had and what kind of cool weapons/armor you had. No wonder so many people cancelled their account after they had thousands of gold pieces and a bank box filled with "rare" items. There was no place to go next.<BR><BR>
	When I cashed in on my 30 day free account to the Realm I was pleasently suprised at what I saw. Many a time when I was off fighting poisonous creatures(and getting killed) I was stuck with poison damage which I could not cure. I would quickly run back to town and ask for someone to help me out. Not one, not two but three or four people would always quickly heal me with nothing in return but a smile and my eternal gratitude. Was this a sense of community I was seeing? Now, The Realm was far(and I mean far) from being perfect but it did get one thing right, the community. So what made this sense of community? People had what they wanted. Albeit because The Realm was a bit too simple to master, the greed that plagued UO was not there.<BR><BR>
	So you're asking yourself, "So what? What do these games have to do with EverQuest?" That part is simple. They provide an invaluable lesson on how to build a community. What do I suggest? Well, there are several things I think need to be addressed in order to ensure that EverQuest developes a strong community, and therefor withstands the test of time. First, EverQuest needs to prevent the greed that haunts Ultima Online. How? Well, 989S needs to de-emphasize the importance of level, weapons/armor, and all symbols of wealth for that matter. To achieve this 989S need to add much variety to clothes/weapons/armor. Make being different, normal. If everyone has something different no longer will certain items be associated with high level players making everyone jealous and having their only goal as improving their stats. Also, 989S needs to make sure that players' levels/stats are not readily available by just walking up and clicking on someone.<BR><BR>
	What else could be done to build community? Try putting the emphasis on character interaction and not kill, kill and kill some more. I am not talking adding mind numbing skills like lumberjacking or mining, but "force" people to interact with each other. Don't do anything too drastic like force people to talk to 5 people before they can leave the city but make interaction as a vital part to having fun. Filling bartenders and NPC bar patrons with viable rumors(not those "I heard there is a magical mushroom of tripping out somewhere to the east of here") would be a good idea. How about having GMs take the place of bartenders/town cryers instead of just monsters. Wouldn't it be fun to have an actual conversation with a real life bartender, with a real life attitude? And, finally, one of my biggest pet peeves is to reward people for their actions. Why not give those who show an outstanding ability to communicate the ability to take over NPCs/make quests/get special quests? This might just give people the most inscentive to help build community and it's important that players feel they need to band together because without them, there is no community.<BR><BR>
	With a little cooperation between 989 Studios and those potential EQ players, EverQuest can have one of the strongest communities ever seen in an online game of it's nature. Just don't forget to do your part and give 989S plenty of ideas on how to improve EQ.<BR><BR>
