<B><U>Brad Replies</U></B><BR>
Although Brad hasnt responded to any of my E-mail concerning obtaining an interview with him, he did respond to one of my posts on alt.games.everquest here it is below:<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="Silver">
Ok, Brad wants us to update the faq, so he wants us to send him questions AND answers... this debases the meaning of a FAQ.. a faq is frequently asked questions... not frequently questioned answers... people ask questions because they dont know the answers... if he doesnt want unanswered questions, then there is not going to be anything we dont already know in the faq... unless he throws in some of his own unanswered questions, what is the point in having the faq? ~~ Arr</font><BR><BR>
<font color="#FFFFFF">
There is quite a bit of information we've released through various chats and newsgroup postings that is either not contained in the current FAQ or updates or clarifies portions of the FAQ. My request was for people to go through the chats and postings, compile that information, and then send it to me, so I can update the FAQ. ~~ Brad

<blockquote><font color="silver">
<LI>If you are a dark elf, yous start in Neriak, home of the dark elves.
<LI>If you are not a dark elf, or an enemy of the dark elves, you are better off not knowing how to get to Neriak.
<li>The home of the elves, Felwithe, will be amongst next months screen shots.
<li>If your guild is composed of many races, and your wandering how to hook up with each other, you should try walking.

Aparrently some people misunderstood him to mean that bug pathec and the like were going to cost money, which is incorrect. Below is a snippet from the AVault EQ Forum claifying this issue.<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="#FFFFFF">
Ok, apparently I haven't been sufficiently clear (sorry) -- expansions, not updates. UO is indeed charging for their expansion -- it's called UO Gold. That's the kind of thing I'm talking about here. Of course we're not going to charge for updates like bug fixes, game balance tweaking, etc. ~~ Brad</font><BR><BR>

<B><U>The "Black Light Effect"</U></B><BR>
Here is Brads explaination as to why everything is dark in the underground city of Neriak. :)<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="silver">
I dunno, lots of pictures i see seem like they were shot under a black light (White hair, dark complexions, funky colored walls). ~~ Sir Ghalahadd</font><BR><BR>
<font color="#FFFFFF">
I assume here you are refering to the pics of Neriak, home of the Dark Elves, and taken by a dark elf (which have innate ultravision, hence the 'black light' effect).</font><BR><BR>
<font color="silver">
But, the whole game shouldn't be dark as such. Dungeons of course need to be, but a town square at noon wouldn't generally be dark and gloomy</font><BR><BR>
<font color="#FFFFFF">
A town square in Neriak, which is a huge underground city, would. There are quite a few other shots of EQ showing the surface world out there -- including in the same batch of screenshots, I'm pretty sure. ~~ Brad</font><BR><BR>

<B><U>High Res = Lag ?</U></B><BR>
Wrong. Although I knew that resoloution is an option set by the client and has no effect on the amount of data being sent to and from the server, Brad still had to clear this up for a few people. <BR><BR>
<blockquote>
<font color="Silver">
So, the question is: Does high res cause more lag if only using a modem (assume very fast machine and SLI voodoo2)? Does more information need to cross the phone lines if in high-res? ~~ The Professor
</font><BR><BR>
<font color="#FFFFFF">
The resolution you run EQ in has ZERO to do with internet lag -- the exact same amount of information is being passed between your client and the server. ~~ Brad

<B><U>Thayer Calls it Quits</U></B><BR>
Today, Thayer, former author of <a href="http://eqss.stratics.com" target="New">EQSS</A>, called it quits after posting an exclusive screenshot taken from <a href="http://www.gamewarp.com/everquest" target="New">Everquest Extreme</a> that resulted in a multi-site boycott aimed at the popular Everquest site. In his parting letter to DenDragon, the lead editor and designer of the <a href="http://www.stratics.com/" target="New">Stratics network</a>, Thayer said:<BR><BR>
<blockquote>
<font color="silver"><I>"They win...if you haven't seen the news, I supposedly wronged them...they started a boycott, and although I could care less about the whole thing, I am quitting EQSS."*</i><BR>
<font size=1>* Excerpt taken from the <a href="http://eqss.stratis.com" target="new">EQSS</A> web page.</font></font>
</blockquote>
<BR><BR>
Some say that the boycott was a direct result of the plagaristic tendancies of Thayer. Tendancies that spanned the time frame of at least several months. Over the past 24 hours many examples of such plagarism have been flung around by sites participating in the boycott, including this one. All those that participated in the boycott did not intend for Thayer to give up his post, they simply wanted him to see the error of his ways... However, Thayer is gone, and now ColdRain has taken his place. With any luck EQSS will remain a fine site with some journalistic ethics under ColdRains suprivision...<BR><BR>

<B><U>War Time!!</U></B><BR>
Well... <a href="Thayer@stratics.com">Thayer</a> has gone against the wishes of <a href="http://www.gamewarp.com/everquest">Everquest Extreme</a>. If you recall at the end of their article they explicitly asked that other sites wishing to post the screenshot contact the authors of EQX first.. I did so, and was asked to put the thumbnail up and have it link to the EQX site... Thayer failed to give EQX even this courtesy and posted the screenshot. I was told just moments ago that Thayer was asked to remove the screenshot until EQX wished it to become more public. This was his response. <BR>
<font color="silver"><blockquote>
   I'm sorry to say that you have copied material in the past that has been
copyrighted by Stratics and I do not recognize your authority...<BR><BR>

    Good luck in your fruitless and empty threats...<BR><BR>

What a dickish reply. This isnt the first time that Thayer has "Cut and Pasted" another sites news...<BR><BR>
For Example, Back when I posted some of the first information regarding the existance of werewolves in Everquest, bingo, within a day, the exact text of my article was mirrored on EQSS...<BR><BR>
Other sites should join in the war vs. Thayer... Post your own examples and experiences with this dick...<BR><BR>
We can be expecting to see a post similar to this on EQX fairly soon, and knowing Thayer, we can expect to see the exact text of this article within the day also...<BR><BR>

I found this post on the <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/boards/dev/" target="New">EQ Vault Dev Board</A>. It basically says that all of the recent screenshots are taken using 3DFX in D3D mode...<BR><BR>
<blockquote><font color="silver">
: Brad,<BR><BR>

: There have been several threads now on various boards about how different video cards would/will be useless for EQ because D3D "sucks" as one person put it.<BR><BR>

: So far, all of the screenshots that have been posted have been stated to be from a 3dfx card, but it was not stated whether they are using D3D or Glide.<BR><BR>

: Could you clear this up for us? Are the current screenshots the best possible looks (ie: Glide in some peoples opinion), or are they the 'lowest common denominator'.. ie: D3D.<BR><BR>

All screenshots released in the last, oh, 7 months or so, have been 3dfx cards running in d3d mode.<BR><BR>

One of the artists from 989s came into #everquest just a moment ago, and answered a few questions for us before speeding off into the distance... Basically: this is a summary of what we gt out of him... :)<BR><BR>
<LI>Load Times: It is still up in the air as to how the load times while crossing zone boundaries will work, but they are doing what they can to minimize the effect...
<LI>Rouges Sneaking and Hiding: Not allowed to answer
<LI>In Game Movie Recordings: The ability to record movies is not in the game as it is now, but it should be possible to add in at a alater date...
<LI>Big Breasts: (question courtesy of Tarans) Were you forced to draw the big breasts? (answer:) hahha   lot of research went into those<BR><BR>

As I write this, my counter is at 4998, And this site will be breaking the 5000 mark within the hour... Its people like you that make a web page run by a lazy person like me a success.. I thank you all.. keep coming back.... If I had something to give away as a gift for the 10,000th hit I would, but i have no way of telling who that hit was, nor the money to buy the prize... If you folks want to donate money to me to keep this web page running, it will be greatly welcomed, as I refuse to put those ugly, annoying banners on my page to make some money, this entire page is coming out of my pocket... Again, I thank you...<BR><BR>

The fellahs over at <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="New">EverQuest</A> have released some new and long overdue screenshots. The neat thing about these screenshots is that they were taken during actual gameplay, complete with chat and character names. You can check out the new screenshots over in the <a href="hsindex.html">Holidae Snaps</a> section. I also finally got around to posting Mays' screenshots... They have been on the site for a while but I just now got around to creating an index for them... Enjoy!<BR><BR>

<B>Lack of Updates</B><BR>
I know it has been almost a week since my last update, and the reason is twofold. I have both been extremely busy with work, and I recently bought a new desk, and my computer has been disconnected for the past 2 days to make room for the construction of the new desk. Exect ore updates as they arrive... I know I missed quite a bit concerning #Everquest and the NDA, but I am sure that you all went to the other excellent EQ sites listed in my links section for that news. News will now continue to be updated as it was before...<BR><BR>And now, a quote from the new movie <I>Armageddon</I>...<BR>"The first person to find her get ta name her right?"<BR>"That Is Correct"<BR>"I'd like to name her <I>Dottie</I>, after my wife... [pause] ...cause shes a life sucking bitch from which there is no escape..."

Thers not much out there in the way of EverQuest News today... there is a little bit of information on <a href="http://www.gamewarp.com/everquest/" Target="New">EverQuest Extreme</a> concerning shadow knights and paladins... worth a look, especially if you are in dire need of an EQ Fix<BR><BR>

<B>Trolls ala Milo</B><BR>
Since the public has never really seen any up-close and detailed pictures of a troll, I asked Milo Cooper, 3D character artist for EverQuest, for a better description. This is what he replied:<BR><BR>
<blockquote>
<I>   They're about nine or ten feet tall, they have classic
Hallowe'en witch faces (i.e. long nose, jutting chin, mean
expression, etc.), they have big, pointy ears, they're
bald, they have very long, almost gorilla-like arms, they
have somewhat stumpy but muscular legs, they're a little
fat, they hunch when they walk, they have big feet, their
bodies sport various scars and pustules, they have broad
shoulders, and they're green.</I><BR><BR>
</blockquote>

Since a lot of fans out there draw their own fantasy oriented art, I thought it might not be a bad idea to post some of this art, so <a href="mailto:arrmihardies@notcrazy.com" subject="Art Submission">send in your art submissions</A>. Almost all, if not everything at this point will be posted. Maybe if this section goes well, I may start a contest for the art section, maybe with prizes, who knows?
