<B><I>Todays Updates</I></B><BR>
<B><I>21:3:40 PST</I></B><BR>
Just got this in from Smedly concerning the updates that have taken place today.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Hello All,

<p>I waited until it was 7:30pm pst tonight to write this update. I wanted to
make sure things were stable before I wrote this. Lately every time I give
an update something bad happened right after I sent it.

<p>Here's a summary of what was done in the last 2 days

<p>1) We did a major hardware upgrade to our primary router here in San Diego.
<br>2) We worked with CERFnet to do a router upgrade to their facility here in
San Diego.
<br>3) We moved Karana over to CERFnet
<br>4) We brought up Rodcet Nife

<p>I think you will find now that the packet loss should be basically gone...
at least on our end. We were definetely causing some of the loss before
(only when we hit major numbers) but now things are very, very clean running
and that is with 23,582 people on just as I write this (a new record).

<p>Does this mean that EVERYONE'S Packet Loss is gone? Absolutely not. BUT, I
did some surveys in most of the worlds and about 75% of the people told me
their Packet Loss was great. If you are having problems now, do a traceroute
to chat.everquest.com and send it to the email address traceroute@verant.com
and we will take a look. We take our customers connections very seriously,
and if a whole lot of people on one network are having a problem we will do
our best to look into it. It doesn't mean we can always get the reaction we
want (some networks are just plain bad) but many times we can help find a
legitimate problem and help correct it.

<p>Some of you may also not realize what the network statistics we have in game
actually are for:

<p>The left hand number is your ping to the server in milliseconds.
The left-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss to the server
The right-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss from the server
The right hand number is the data rate. THIS IS NOT THE PING. - I love
hearing about the "terrible" pings in game of 3000.

<p>It is my strong belief (forgive me for this rant) that EVERY online game
should have this type of meter so that you are getting real feedback about
the network status.


<p>John Smedley

<B><I>Brad Q &amp; A</I></B><BR>
<B><I>17:24:29 PST</I></B><BR>
Sacrates form <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/Alteredworlds" target="_new">Altered Worlds</a> recently had a short Q &amp; A with Brad about various topics such as new continents and Server overcrowding.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Are you going to be Beta testing the new Continents before they go Public? (Even though you haven't announced them yet) </font>

<p><font color="white" size="-1">In that nothing is official yet, I have no comment. Sorry. </font>

<p><font color="silver" size="-1">Oh and also another thing of particular interest to me. Do you expect a major influx of new people onto the Servers after European release? I hear there is one new server being added on Monday but do you expect that to be enough? </font>

<p><font color="white" size="-1">Given the number of units going into Europe relative to those still being sold in the States, combined with the fact that Europeans mostly play during the wee hours of the morning (from our perspective), I'm not too concerned. If it becomes a problem, however, we will put up additional servers. </font>

<p><font color="silver" size="-1">Hell, I don't even log on any time after 6 PM EST anymore because of Server crowding issues. (And I am playing on Bertox, which is the newest) I think anything over 1200 IMHO too crowded to play. Thanks brother. </font>

<p><font color="white" size="-1">The server I play on has about 1300 during peak hours and it's fine. I really think it depends on where one plays and whether one ventures out into the less populated areas. That said, the world is designed to handle at least 1,500 people at one time, however this assumes that players are spread out. And players are spreading out, slowly but surely. It just takes some time. Keep in mind that probably 2/3s of the zones are empty or darn close to empty in that we split the zones up into lower level, mid level, and higher level areas.

<B><I>Samhaime Event on Mithaniel Marr</I></B><BR>
<B><I>13:36:46 PST</I></B><BR>
Darmquizan informs me a a Samhaime event taking place on Mithaniel Marr. Here is what he had to say:

<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
(Mithaniel Marr)

<p>Greetings fair gents and ladies of splendor!
 
<p>  A time has arisen to hold a Samhaime festival to depart in the central city of Freeport(May 1st & 2nd).
<br>-  There shall be a tournament of mights and spectacles to behold.  Come forth to parry with your sword and your wits against your fellow citizen and foe!
<br>-  Craftsmen and Tradesmen bring your wares for the Bazaar hosted at the Theater of the Tranquil.
<br>- An archery contest shall be held  that promises to lay to rest once and for all the question of the usefullness of the bow in Norrath! Come forthe ye archers and put you money where you mouth is,  call upon your finest stock and quiver to perform in this magnificent specticle.
<Br>-  Squires shall be on call for the clean up for those juggling profound feats in front of the masses.
<br>-  Bring your livestock as well, for they shall be slaughtered at no cost during these affairs.
 
<p>  Ah, but what would be a festival without those to assist in it?  We shall be at the need of additional voluteers who wish to better their community.  If you have such interests, or wish to post another contest or event, contact Darmquizan (brooks_damian@hotmail.com), there would not be profit without sacrifice after all.</font></blockquote>

This patch message showed up on the servers today. Hopefully this will solver most peoples problems.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Server Update 4/27/99 7:30 pm 
<br>Citizens of Norrath, 

<p>We are pleased to announce that the hardware upgrade that was performed on our router this morning has appeared to resolve the severe packet loss problems that many players were encountering over the past week. We have been, and will continue to monitor the load on the new hardware to assure that the packet-loss problems will no longer occur on our end. During the router upgrade we transported the Karana server farm to the AT&T CerfNet facility to further reduce the load on our router. Also, the new "Rodcet Nife" server was just brought up to accommodate the additional users that have joined over the past few weeks. After thoroughly testing changes made only for Rallos Zek (PK server), we have activated the new code for the PK server ONLY. 

<p>The changes include the following; 

<br>1) Pets will no longer kill themselves if their master has invisibility cast on them. 

<br>2) Pets will no longer attack other players while they are in guard mode if their master goes link-dead. 
<br>3) Pets will now attack opposing combatants while their master is dueling. 
<br>4) NPCs will no longer respond to invisible PCs. 
<p>Other fixes and changes include: 

<p>1) The corpse class tag will not be listed as "Unknown". 

<br>2) Players will be given text messages for items that they cannot obtain while looting a corpse, instead of the item disappearing. 
<br>3) A number of quests and combat related exploits were fixed. 
<br>4) Characters are no longer able to use the disarm command while using feign death. 
<p>At Midnight, on Wednesday the 28th, the servers will be brought down for an update. 

<p>- The EverQuest Team

This was sent to us from Brokke regarding a <a href="http://moltenlava.com/everquest/eqitems">EQ Magic Page</a> (spoiler)-
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Greetings!! 

In my travels I have seen many great things. Many of these wonders have been Items of power. On my travels I have kept record of some of the magic items I have run across. But I found what little I knew to be lacking, so I asked my guild mates to help me in my quest for knowledge of magic items. Soon my knowledge grew but my Dwarven avaricious made me want even more. So I come to you all to feed me with more knowledge of what magic items can be gained in our fair land. In exchange I shall share what i have learned with you, tis the only price i can afford to pay.

<B><I>Jythris Concert</I></B><BR>
<B><I>12:49:26 PST</I></B><BR>
Just in from Chromite, a reivew of Jythris concert!. Thanks Chromite!
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
My wife (Felina) and I (Chromite) recently attended the Sunday night
concert of the Soerbaird.  We were fortunate enough to hear the wonderous
songs of these talented bards and enjoy the company of our fellow Norrathians.
The bards that performed were Dain, Wagi, Tionne and Jythri.  

<p>Despite some rabble-rousers and untrained audience members, the concert
played out great!  Most members of the audience were courteous enough to
place their weapons and shields out of sight.  This was a kind gesture to
the peaceful Soerbaird.  In between each performance Jythri asked a riddle.
There were 3 riddles total and I won the second riddle.  The first prize
given out was a lightstone.  The second prize given out was 2 plat, which
I gladly accepted for my quick answer.  The third prize given out was a
greater lightstone.

<p>All in all it was quite an entertaining event and is definately something
one should experience at least once in their Norrathian lifetime.

<p>I look forward to seeing new concert attendees at the next concert!

Just in from Guide Thorim about guides/gm.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
There is now a Guide & GM FAQ available on the Everquest home page under
the support section.  This FAQ should help explain to all the players just
what a Guide or GM can do for them in the game, as well as what they cannot
do.  I encourage all players to take the few minutes needed to read this
information.

<p>To read the FAQ, go to <a href="http://www.everquest.com" target="_new">www.everquest.com</a>, and go to the "Support" section.
There you will find a link to the GM & Guide FAQ.

<B><I>More on New Server and Packet loss</I></B><BR>
<B><I>18:35:26 PST</I></B><BR>
I just got this in the mail from Johnny concerning exactly what his past several post have been concerning.
<p><blockquote><font color="Silver" size="-1">
Hello All,

<p>As many of you are seeing we are having some Packet Loss issues right now.
These issues will be addressed tomorrow morning beginning at 9:30am. We will
be doing some maintenence on our Router here, so the game will be
unavailable for about an hour. This solution should take care of things
quite handily.

<p>In addition tomorrow we will be moving the Karana server over to CERFnet, as
well as setting up the newest server Rodcet Nife. We tried to do this today,
but we had some logistics issues with CERFnet and we had to delay this until
tomorrow.

<p>I don't have an exact ETA on Rodcet Nife, except to say that it will be
tomorrow sometime. You would be amazed how many people were sitting in chat
today just waiting for this server to come up ;)

<p>We do apologize for the inconvienence this downtime will cause, however we
think that everyone will be a lot happier once this Packet Loss goes away.

<p>John Smedley

We received this little bit of info from Mr. Smedly regarding the new server:
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
We will be postponing putting up the new server by 24 hours. It will go up sometime on Tuesday. We ran into a few logistics problems that prevented us from doing it today.

Hopefully their changes will put an end to the high packet loss many of us have been experiencing. Here's the patch details:<BR><BR><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
April 26th, 3:15pm<BR>------------------<BR><BR>
We will be moving an existing server farm over to the AT&T CerfNet network sometime tomorrow.  In addition, a new server will be brought up to accommodate the increase of users that we have seen over the past few weeks.  A time has not been set, nor has a decision of which server will be transported, however, an announcement will be made tomorrow morning.<BR><BR>
The movement of the mentioned servers should help alleviate the packetloss problems that some of you have encountered.<BR><BR>

<B><I>Slackers</I></B><BR>
<B><I>12:1:52 PST</I></B><BR>
Ok, were a bunch of slackers. There have evidently been a lot of messages by John Smedly (which we are no longer recieving might I add) concerning connection issues. While I apologize for the lateness of these, but given that there are 7 other staffers on the site, someone should have gotten to it by now. I think its time to re-evauluate my staff. On that same note, Im looking for someone to manage this EQ site while I concentrate my efforts on building up our AC site. Basically applicants need to have 1-2 hours free a day (this is rarely all used, but need to have that time avalible for the busy news days) To perform updates on the site. <a href="mailto:arrmihardies@notcrazy.com?subject=staff">mail me</a> if your interested.
<p> Anyways, here are the posts in order of newest to oldest.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">

Well.. I'm hesitant to give an update.. I can't say my last
update was timed all that well. 10 Minutes after writing it
we had a problem.<BR>
At the risk of doing it again: 

<P>We've found out that he solution we put in place earlier
didn't fix the problem entirely. We need to make some
more changes.

<p>In addition, we are going to be bringing up another server
tomorrow and probably be moving at least one existing
server farm over to CERFnet. We will announce which one
will be moved tomorrow AM. 

<p>John Smedley
<p><hr>
<p>While working with UUnet today on some other issues, we found and fixed a configuration problem on our end which was resulting in extra packet loss on many of our servers.<BR>
This problem has been resolved and I believe you will all see significantly less packet loss.

<p>I want to make sure that when we have a problem on our end and correct it we notify you of that as well, since many people feel we are quick to blame someone else.

<p>There's no point in blaming a problem on UUnet if it's our problem. In this case it was on our end and it's fixed. This was a different problem then the one we were seeing last night on UUnet, but it probably amplified it.

<p>I also want to remind everyone that we are working on getting another server up tomorrow. I'll have a further update on that in the AM tomorrow
morning. 


<p>John Smedley
<p><hr>
<p>I wanted to give one final status report for the night. I just got off the phone with UUnet and the problem appears to be resolved completely (it was actually resolved several hours ago, but we've been monitoring it closely).

<p>In addition, I spoke with the Backbone engineers at CERFnet tonight as well. They made some changes which should drop Packet Loss along their routes as well.

<p>John Smedley 
<p><hr>
<p>I want to address this point very clearly...
<p>We cannot control the Internet.

<p>Why did you put all the servers in one place then? Many of you have asked.

<p>Well, network wise there are 2 different ISP's coming in to us. UUnet and CERFnet.

<p>The bad PL MANY people were experiencing tonight is the result of an outage in the NY area that isn't even on either one of our ISP's.. but you will quickly find that this can
have a trickle down effect.

<p>IF you see bad PL, email me at jsmedley@verant.com WITH a traceroute that goes to chat.everquest.com

<p>You won't be able to trace all the way in, but I will be able to look at the traceroutes and tell what's going on.

<p>Anytime we see a lot of people with bad PL we immediately do a full series of tests. I've been doing this all night tonight and I am seeing our paths both in and out as being clear, although I do hear complaints from some people. Most of those people ARE on the East Coast.

<p>John Smedley 
<p><hr>
<p>Looks like UUnet had a problem at 9:46 pm PST tonight. I'm on the phone with them now working it out. I'll update you all as soon as possible.
We apologize for the problem.

<B><I>Testing the waters of guild hosting</I></B><BR>
<B><I>2:42:46 PST</I></B><BR>
Im currently looking into doing site hosting for, well, pretty much anyone really, but will be concentrating on guilds and the like, and just want to test the waters to see what kind of interest there is in the program.
<p>Hosting fees will probably start at around 10$/month, will include unlimited space (100MB limit on binaries) subdomain of notcrazy (such as yourguild.notcrazy.com (maybe subdirectory on a guild specific site (such as guilds.notcrazy.com/~yourguild). depends on what i can swing ). Accounts from as low as 10$/month for subdomain, 20$/mo for a domain account. All accounts would have a 30 free trial.
<p>If you are at all interested please <a href="mailto:arrmihardies@notcrazy.com?subject=WebHosting">E-Mail me</a>. As I said, this is not being offered yet, Im just testing the waters to see if it would be feasable to be offered.

<B><I>Better Late Than Never</I></B><BR>
<B><I>17:26:6 PST</I></B><BR>
Well below are a few posts, one by Brad McQuaid and one by John Smedley. These were both "borrowed" off of <a href="http://www.everworld.com">EverWorld</a>.<BR><BR>
First off Johnny had this to say about several issues including new servers.<BR><BR><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
I was just reading some posts here and I wanted to give some info on a couple of subjects:<BR><BR>
1) New Servers - We are working on getting up a new server next Monday.<BR><BR>
2) PvP Server - PC's that died to NPC's won't be able to be looted except by the person that died (or with a /consent).<BR><BR>
3) Casting Invis. on Players to kill Pets - This will be fixed by requiring the person you cast it on to consent to it.<BR><BR>
We will be adding a new section to our webpage to keep you all informed about what we are working on.<BR><BR>
John Smedley<BR><BR></font></blockquote>
The Bradman had the following to say about the "quest" in EverQuest, I'd say more but hell you can read it for yourself :)<BR><BR><BR><BR><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Quests are something that are constantly being added to the game. They may or may not be balanced correctly the first time. Also, while one reward will be great for one player, another might think it wasn't worth doing the quest. Another might think the reward was too great. This is just the nature of the beast.<BR><BR>
Game balance is very important to us, and I think we've done an overall great job at it. But in that quests are constantly being added, I don't expect them to be perfect the first time. This is a price we all pay for having a dynamic evolving game. Not only that, but we will purposely move, modify, or take out quests that may have been 'fine' just to keep the game interesting and changing.<BR><BR>
The bottom line is if you like doing quests, go for it. If your only incentive for doing the quest is to get some great reward, then you probably ought to just hack monsters. Doing quests are supposed to be fun in and of themselves. My quest team has done a great job of integrating the detailed story behind the world of Norrath into these quests -- heck, they've spent well over a year doing this and continue working on them every day. You learn about the world doing quests and people have a great time in the process of doing them. But quests aren't for everyone, nor are they meant to be.<BR><BR>
Looking through some of the quests you listed I certainly found some that seemed to have rewards a bit on the low side. And there will be some on the high side. And they will change and are part of our constant tuning and balancing.<BR><BR>
I do NOT however consider these 'broken' quests that need to be 'fixed'. Broken quests are ones that simply don't work. For example, perhaps you hand the final item to the NPC, he says 'thanks, here's your holy sword of slashing' and then you receive nothing. Fixing those if there are any left would be our priority, btw. <BR><BR>Brad McQuaid

<B><I>Re: Re: Re: Re: Review</I></B><BR>
<B><I>21:34:22 PST</I></B><BR>
<a href="http://www.electricgames.com" target="_new">Electric Games</a> has done an excellent, long <a href="http://www.electricgames.com/reviews/e/everquest.html" target="_new">review</a> of everquest, hitting on almost every topic. I suggest you read it. If you read it already, read it again anyways... 
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">Another of the brilliant things about Everquest is the layout and design of the world. I mentioned before that you'll discover forests, deserts, and other environments throughout the game world. The different races' home cities are scattered throughout Norrath and each has it's own distinctive look and style. The human cities are well-fortified walled structures with buildings and shops contained safely within. The erudite (high human) city stands majestically along the cliffs of their home continent. The wood elves live in structures built high in the treetops using suspension bridges to interconnect them and elevators to gain access. Trolls and ogres live in caves, and the troll home is situated near a murky swamp. The dark elf city lies far underground and features a breathtaking, yet frightening, architectural design. The gnome city is overrun by machines that can guide you where you want to go. The game world is enormous and full of variety. Norrath is currently composed of three continents, the largest of which would literally take hours to walk from one end to the other. </font></blockquote>

<B><I>Brad on PVP</I></B><BR>
<B><I>7:48:55 PST</I></B><BR>
Brad talks about PVP, also a brief question on ideas I like.  A possibility of a PVP server where Humans can't kill Human's but they can kill Trolls.  How would you like to have your PKing limited to out-of-race kills?  Well there are ups and downs on this one, read on.
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
<i>Everquest is overwhelmingly of course a player-versus-environment game. But there are those of us who see player-versus-player as the only real way to experience a role-playing game. Indeed, I would never play this game without the ability to fully experience a dynamic environment in which the great story of racial and factional conflict you've created couldn't be lived without the challenge of roleplayed PvP. While you've one server dedicated to us now, I believe that in time you will find more and more players either turning on their PK-flags or moving to PvP-dedicated worlds. The reason for this is simple: the challenge and fun of fighting monsters and questing inevitably ends or grows uninteresting, even with so-called "expansion packs." In 6, 8, or 12 months when many players have done and seen "it all"- or enough to see a deadend- they will crave new options, and this usually means PvP and/or advanced crafts. Rallos Zek is not only the best roleplaying shard in my opinion (the messageboards don't correctly show the real situation), but unlikely the switch servers, when lots of players reach rank 40+, Everquest will just be beginning for us; whereas, for those on switch shards, the game will just be ending.</i>
<br><br>
I do have to disagree here -- we are confident we can keep PvE interesting up to level 50 (and even perhaps beyond :) 
<br><br>
Presently however PvP has a fair number of bugs and exploits which if you check the PvP and Rallos Zek messageboard are fairly well and completely discussed in various posts. It'd be nice if you'd at least recognize these problems and let us know that in time you intend to fix them. Do you have other plans of enhancing more player-driven structures in the game beyond PvP as well?
<br><br>
Absolutely. The PvP server is very important to us and we are proud that we can support different playing styles within the same game (using different servers as well as the PK switch). 
<br><br>
As John and I have mentioned, we are changing it such that if you are killed by an NPC, only you are someone to whom you give consent will be able to loot your corpse. 
<br><br>
Invisibility will be a consent spell like Bind Affinity, such that you have to be grouped with someone before they can cast it on you (this will eliminate the need to delete a player's pet). 
<br><br>
Also, we will be adding factions for PvP in the future. 
<br><br>
Lastly, we are tossing around the idea of another server where different races are either allies or enemies. For example, humans couldn't PK humans, but could trolls, and vice versa. Please let us know what you think about this. 
<br><br>
