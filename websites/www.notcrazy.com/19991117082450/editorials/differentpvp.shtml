Recently there has been a lot of controversy concerning PvP in Everquest.   A lot has been said on both sides of the story, some begging for a complete PvP server, and others dedicated to the PvP switch.  I think that both sides have many good points, but there are some problem areas on both sides that just haven't been resolved.  <BR><BR>

What do I think about the PvP switch?<BR>
	At first I thought this was a great idea, those that wanted to go PvP could, and those that wanted a little extra protection would have it.  In theory this seems like a great idea, but in practice it doesn't quite work out for the people that want to go PvP.  Unfortunately there are not very many people that would choose to go PvP when everyone around them is not.  This makes the life of a PvP a lonely and nearly pointless one.  I think that it is necessary for a massive online game such as EQ to have a means by which players can "have it out" with each other, and I think that the duel command satisfies this.  For those of you that don't know, all it takes is a click and a "/duel" command by both of the characters and then those two and only those two characters can proceed to beat the crap out of each other.  Furthermore with the implementation of guilds and the possibility of entire guilds to duel it out in a war fashion makes this even better than the PvP switch.  I think it was really great of, lets just call them the EQ people (whatever the company's name is now), to put in the option of a PvP switch to try and satisfy everyone, but from my experience in the beta its just not reallyworking out.<BR><BR>

What about a PvP server?<BR>
	There are some among us that have seen, or perhaps in a way haven't seen, the PvP switch in action in beta.  These people along with die hard PvP people would like an environment where they can be among others who enjoy this type of play.  Also EQ is not the type of game that lends itself to PvP too easily.  Before some of you misunderstand, my point is that with a class and level system such as the one in EQ a character may have a great advantage over another with only a few levels difference, or even at the same level but a different class.  With a difference of more than five levels there is no contest most of the time.  This problem was addressed with the four level limit (PvP characters can only attack other within 4 levels of their own).  There are times when I myself would enjoy some good PvP action, but with my experience in another online game I don't think that I would choose to play exclusively on a fully PvP server.  I think there are a lot of other people that share this opinion and would like to play in a more competitive environment but don't want to play in a completely chaotic world.  As a result the PvP server will probably fail and all those people that love PvP will be forced to use the switch.<BR><BR>

So what do I think can be done?<BR>
	I think that it is possible to develop an environment that can satisfy both the PvE and the PvP audience.  I also think that it is possible for this environment to promote roleplaying among both parties as well.  Nonsense some of you may say but just hear me out.  So how do you do this, well lets take a look at the world of EQ.  The EQ people have given us a world of many races, some good some evil.  Naturally these opposing races are at war with each other.  This situation already exists with NPCs and such, but I think that it should be extended to include PCs.  I suggest that instead of making a server that is entirely PvP, that the server be made to allow the opposing races to fight each other, but not allow either side to attack their allies or their own race.<BR><BR>
	One thing that just didn't appeal to me about the PvP server is that I could make a character and walk out of town only to be stabbed in the back by someone of my own race.  That is just something that I would not expect.  If it was a troll or ogre I might expect something like this and as a result watch my back, but to regularly get killed by those of your own race is just ridiculous.  <BR>
	Unfortunately there are nine "good" races and only three "evil" races.  This may lead to an imbalance in the number of players on each side but to fix that would require a complete redesign of the game and I don't think that is necessary or possible.  Ideally there should at least be one more evil race but lets just ignore that for now.  Perhaps some of the races could be considered neutral but that leads us back to -pvp land.  <BR><BR>
	
Now where does this idea lead us?  <BR>
	Well for one the races would be segregated, but from my experience in beta we already have this for the most part.  People who would like to avoid conflict with their opposing races could stay near the zones where their race or their allies would have a greater population and thus a greater control of the area.  The geography of the game somewhat supports this, but the dark elves are in a bit of a tight spot.  But again this is something that can't be changed at this stage and I think that there is enough land for everyone to make due.  Those who want a good fight can try to invade into their enemies territory.  I think that the four level limit will still be necessary to prevent higher level characters from preying on low level characters and to keep the fighting balanced.  This may limit some people from playing the "good" troll or "evil" halfling but I think this is a better environment than that of a completely PvP server.  Perhaps it would be possible to use faction standings in conjuction with this system to make it possible to change the alignment of your character.  This implementation of PvP not only gives everyone some of what they want but it also becomes entirely possible for the players to roleplay off of this situation.  I don't really see too much wrong with this idea, but I may be wrong.  This may turn out to be just as popular as the PvP switch, but I think that this is a possible and enjoyable solution to the problem at hand.  One thing I know for sure is that if this type of server was implemented I for one would play here above all else. <BR><BR>

	This is an idea I had way back towards the beginning of the EQ beta and I am sure that there are a lot of other people out there that have had similar ideas and would like to see something like this happen.  I know I should have come forward sooner but we can't change the past, we can only act now.  So I would like to hear from everyone who supports or dislikes this idea.  If there is enough support for this idea I think we might be able to convince the powers that be to try and make it a reality.  I wan't nothing more than to make EQ a better and more enjoyable game for everyone.  Thank you for your time and please send me your questions, comments, and anything else and lets just see what happens.<BR><BR>
