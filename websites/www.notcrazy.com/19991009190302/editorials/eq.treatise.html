Let us, first, look at some of the comparative items between the two.
<BR><BR>
<B><font size=+2>#1. Economy<BR></font></b>
EverQuest seems to disregard the economic factors of detail found 
in Ultima On-line. In UO we are forced to make or take a trade to fall back on. This stems from the fact that a recently deceased PC's armor and equipment are likely to be looted by other PC's immediately upon death and personal property has a 99% chance of being looted within a house. In the case of corpse looting EverQuest announces that this will not be possible and that the newly dead PC will immediately be returned to his "Guild Master" where he will be reborn. 
The corpse of the slain will NOT be lootable, according to the 
EverQuest FAQ. Therefor the PC can return to his corpse and loot himself OR specify them who may loot his corpse for him. This bring a few things to mind:<BR>
<B>a)</B> Based on this Logic the economic necessity for the creation of 
capitol is significantly reduced. Your stuff does not come and go as easily and generally you keep your stuff. However, this is rather flawed because if you died, you certainly died in a dangerous environment and now, sans armor and weapon (etc.) you are required to travel back to the point of death and recoup your belongings. "Good Luck"<BR>
<B>b)</B> In UO I've noticed that it is rare, even if PC's do not loot 
your body, to return to your body without significant decomposition of equipment. Therefor, in EverQuest, there must be a slower decomposition rate to allow for return and recoup of possessions. By not allowing other PC's to pick up gear from a fallen hero we will be required to endure the presence of dead bodies laying about awaiting this longer decomposition rate. It will be nice to enter a dragons lair and observe the number of dead bodies strewn about.... maybe.<BR>
<B>c)</B> The absence of base economic financial generation will free 
those of us not interested in sewing scull caps or mining ore. While these low quality gaming experiences are marginally interesting for an hour or two, the obnoxious repetition of mouse clicks soon becomes tiresome. However, those that invest their time doing such activities are rewarded with more financial capability in UO. Personally, I've sewn enough Scull Caps to clothe a nation and I am more than happy to discontinue with the redundant activity. However, some guilds of UO are Trade Based... or, were expected to be at one time. Surely these ambitious guild will strike upon other ways to influence economic factors. How, exactly, is impossible to tell given the low amount o information available at this time.<BR>
<B>e)</b> There is very very little information about the setup and logic 
of the economy in EverQuest. In UO the failed system of a main resource bank was intended to regulate price and economics. However, I myself have held a 60,000 stone bag containing nothing but thread. It had no effect on the economy (or even thread availability) and thus the UO system was no more than a fairy tale of economic proportions. Hundreds of other examples from Reagent Shortages to a depressed Tailoring economy have been answered by effectively removing the "bank" concept from the economy. Rampant duping of gold proved that there never was a limit o the amount of gold in the world. Let us hope that EQ has a better conceived understanding and request humbly for the staff to give us some idea of this. 
<BR><BR>
<B><font size=+2>#2. Class/Race vs. Skill/Mono-Racial Societal Impacts</font></B><BR>
Ultima On-line and many of its predecessors have neglected the idea 
of a variety of classes and/or races as an option for its players. They further allow the character to excel in a variety of different skills. This is a highly failed system. The presence of the ubiquitous "Tank Mage" forces all successful adventurers to concentrate on the most useful skills and refrain, even hide, from less useful ones. This disallows individuality of character and further requires all "humans" (in UO this is ALL PC's) to be generic and clonish despite the fact that there are many many skills to chose from. When was the last time you saw a Grand Master Veterinarian trading blows with a horde of PK's? When have you ever seen a veterinarian? In EverQuest there are the more typical sets of variables found in the traditional AD&D style RPG. This allows a variety of classes (ranger, thief, etc) to stem from a variety of races (dwarf, elf, barbarian, etc). For those that are inexperienced with this format (those of us with pencil and paper AD&D RPG's find on-line computer games having these options extremely RARE) this will create a lot of confusion. The EverQuest team has introduced a great deal of sociological impacts to these player specific options as well introducing a whole host of possibilities and HUGE potential imbalances.<BR>
<B>a)</b> Each race will have its strengths and its weaknesses. Each class will have it strengths and weaknesses and each follower of a mandated deity will have strengths and weaknesses. Given this, the combinations of all these variables increases the likelihood that there will be SOME combination that is superior to all others... if we are lucky, perhaps there will be some variety in the "best class/race/deity" and if we are extremely lucky these will be found to be on opposing sides of the potential gambit. One of the ONLY ways to avoid this problem is to REQUIRE a variety of players/character types to perform even the most routine of tasks such as the Dungeon Crawl. e.g. a gnome is required to get through the passage to open the door that must be held by a barbarian while a wizard casts a spell at the horde of undead that only the Necromancer can turn away if he has a cleric to bless the dwarf who holds the troll on his shoulders with the crystal ball obtained by the... you get the point.<BR>
<B>b)</B> Societal interactions will be forced. This allows a Troll 
village into which an Elf would not be accepted and underground where only dark elves can see and etc. What if the dark elves are slightly more able to kill trolls than trolls are to kill dark elves? Would you want to be a troll or a dark elf? What if it was MUCH easier for Trolls to kill Dark Elves?? What if gnomes were totally incapable of almost any activity? Would you like to be a gnome? I draw, here, in personal experience. In Neverwinter Nights the BEST class to be was a human Cleric/MagicUser. Almost no other option could compete. The option of being a gnome or a dwarf were completely out of the question unless you wanted to do a sportily job of roll playing a completely helpless being. Why? Very simply, magic was the basis of power and these unplayed classes had no magic to speak of.<BR>
<B>c)</B> Different combinations of character possibilities will be forced 
to live in different places. What if one place has more resources than another?
<BR><BR>
<B><font size=+2>#3. Lag and the common junk</b></font><BR>
Lag. It Kills. So now were talking about a game that is 100% 3D 
on a platform required to be a P266. Why do you think that you need this huge capability? More data to process and more information to deal with. What causes lag? Data transfer slow downs. And will EQ use another backbone of the internet than UO has already been using? Very likely, NO. UO, though faulted and relatively boring, is one of the most technologically advanced server to client systems in its kind. Lag is massive with UO. What is to say that EQ won't be worse? 
Thus far we have very little information from EQ on this issue so, 
perhaps, they know something we (or UO doesn't). But data can only go through a 33.6 baud modem at 33.6 baud (to my knowledge) so...<BR>
<B>a)</B> One of the things we notice about UO's fatal lag is that, 
according to OSI, the existence of MORE STUFF such as tools, treasure and all the "things" in the world. More items on a character or in his bank equated to more problems going from server to server... very interesting what with OSI's insistence that lag had nothing to do with their code or the machines doing this, but I digress. Each "thing" in or on a persons inventory or within an environment has to have a uniqueness that differentiates it from all the other things. e.g. where is it? what's it look like? what's it do? who owns it? etc. Increasing the number of "things" increases the number of calculations each time that thing has to do something like move. A characters inventory (including his banked items) need to be transferred from one server to another. That's why people with huge amounts of stuff in the bank crashed whenever they crossed server boundaries or jumped in a moongate in UO. By the same token, a fully 3D game has got to have significantly more data attached to each THING because its got a polygonal structure made up of hundreds of points to create it... often thousands! Will this increase or decrease lag? I don't know.<BR>
<B>b)</b> EQ states that lag/fast connections will not effect combat and 
melee situations. Essentially the descriptions of such activities are that you get in range of the target, turn on "fight" mode and sit back and watch the combat. This sounds a little boring. I cannot believe that there are no personal tactics involved in the best way to effectively fight something. If you believe it possible, enter UO and find a difficult, but defeatable, monster, initiate a fight, and go have a sandwich or jog around the block a couple times.... "good luck". 
Further, this may work just fine for a swordsman with little else to 
offer himself, but does this mean that magic users will automatically cast the best spell for a given situation in every instance? Now your REALLY boring. I have yet to see how a non-turn-based, melee situation could NOT be effected by a faster connection. I look forward to seeing the innovation.
<BR><BR>
<B><font size=+2>#4. PvP vs. Non-PvP<BR></B></font>
EQ Staff tells us that at "birth" each character will have a 
choice. PvP or Non-PvP. A Non-PvP character cannot be attacked by a PvP character. If a Non-PvP character does something to indicate that he's a PvP'r (such as attack another character) he is turned into a PvP character and will remain so until some difficult process (unspecified) is achieved by that player. This smells extremely problematic to my nose.
<B>a)</B> Prepare for extreme harassment. This will allow someone the 
ability to walk into another persons "area" and begin cussing him out and nobody (no PC anyway) can do anything about it. Imagine yourself sitting in your own personal guild hall with your own stuff and your own friends. Mr. Non-PvP wanders in and starts helping himself to your stuff... what are you going to do about it?<BR>
<B>b)</B> Guild Warfare will be a real joy. I don't know about you, but I 
would figure out how to get to Non-PvP status as quickly as possible... and have the front line of my assault force feel free to walk right up to the enemy guild leader and "OK boys, on three we all attack him".<BR>
<B>c)</B> OK, so I cannot attack the guy but a guard or an animal (NPC) 
can. First, this isn't really faire, and second, how many tricks do you think will be developed to manipulate NPC's into attacking Non-PvP characters? Let our friends the bug-exploiters of UO get hold of this one for about 5 minutes and you've got patch number one through 100 figured out already.<BR>
<B>c)</b> I'll not detail all the abuses possible and bugs probable with 
this format but impervious characters to some and not others spells problems. With luck I'll be wrong as ever.
<BR><BR>
<font size=+2><B>#5. Magic, Travel, and Guilds<BR></b></font>
There are many different possibilities for guild types. But some 
will have a hard time. The ones most likely to experience difficulties are the larger ones designed to control broad categories of game play. The geography of EQ will be huge and travel between the continents and towns will be difficult. EQ Staff assures us that the gate/recall ability for PC's will be extremely difficult. In my opinion the spell recall ruined UO worse than anything else.
Some districts are good. Some districts are evil. Some districts 
are under water!! Troll City NPC's are going to react much differently than Elf City NPC's. My recommendation to any guild of any size and relative diversity is to spread your people out in all directions and race/class formats and see which is the most powerful and funnest to play. Then require all members to quit existing characters and start up as whatever this race is.... sound impossible? 
good, because it is. Existing guilds are going to have hard time and 
only the foolhardy will read the limited details on the EQ web page and make a determination about how and who they are going to be based on that.
<BR><BR>
And so ends my treatise on EverQuest for this edition. I'll keep watching. Perhaps EQ Staff will comment on this and other items of interest and we'll be assured of the stability of this, the future of on-line gaming.
