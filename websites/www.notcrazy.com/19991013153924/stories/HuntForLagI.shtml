I still can't get over the fact that my family decided to put me in this mental hospital. What have I ever done wrong? I've roleplayed properly, never powergamed, I always help out newbies in need and I don't steal kills at all! But today I was determined to get out. During lunch, before the Human Nurse came to feed me, I started tapping Selo`s Accelerando on the wall and when she came in I ran out the door with my song giving me magical speed. As I passed my neighbor's door I heard what I thought was grumbling from him. It sounded a lot like chords of dissonace! I ran away hastily and as the alarm sounded I was surrounded by security guards. These elite security guardsmen were a tough bunch, I knew from my experiences at Blackburrow. I knew that unless I reacted quickly they would kill me. I tried to cast gate, but it kept fizzling as I muttered "You have insufficient mana to cast this spell", and with the guardsmen closing in on me, I yelled out the one word that can get even a group of high level phase 3ers on the run : "TRAIN!" I expected them to run, but these stupid humans just stood still! They must still be newbies. Scaring them didn't work, so I would have to fight for it. The bastards took all my chainmail and my trusty morning star when I entered the hospital, so I would have to rely on my other skills if I were to get out alive. I kicked one, and while I was waiting for my skill delay to wear off they grabbed me and tried to fit me into a white tattered cloth shirt (they were calling it a "straight jacket"... must be some wierd human slang) I knew I was defeated. I yelled at them, "Stupid humans! You're all kEwld00ds aren't you? You just can't accept it when I roleplay!" And one of the guys in a white suit asked me "So you still don't think you're human eh?" "No! I'm only half human, and the only part of me I resent is the mortal part!" I said. As they dragged me back to my room, I saw my chance. I waved my hands in the way I had memorized that would cast Root on the Elites, but unfortunately it was interrupted. Argh! My time was running out. With one final effort I started singing Kelin`s Lugubrious Lament and finally it seemed to work! Their reaction time slowed, crying "Aaargh stop singing so badly!" I ran away and leaped over the wall. I had become better at escaping_from_mental_hospitals(26)! <BR><BR>
It was then that I realized something was wrong. Where was all the lag? In UO, I could not walk without getting hit by lag, but I just realized that I had been lagless ever since I got in Phase four. There must be some secret Verant is using to kill all the lag. Where did all the lag go? Maybe I just gave myself a quest! I have to find what happened to the lag. But where should I start? Hmm... Maybe Brad McQuaid will know the answer. I have to ask him. If I could get home, I could go ask him on the message board somewhere! My affinity was bound to outside this hospital, so gate would do me no good anyway. I would have to run. I turned on autorun and found my /loc coordinates to be 154.65, -5432.43, 12.01 Heading: 423. I turned my heading to 0 to go due North and started running. Crossing two zones, I noticed that the sun was moving a lot slower across the sky than it normally was back in my home town of Qeynos. In fact, it seemed like the sun was going four times as slow! Maybe that was what Verant did to get rid of the lag - they somehow got the sun to go slower! I will have to ask Brad McQuaid about this.<BR><BR>
I finally made it home. No one was home - I suspect everyone was out on a quest. When I went to my room, it seemed like it was empty, and all of a sudden I realized : they took away my computer! Maybe the server was not responding. I must find another computer - those handy little gnoll machines are really neat! Wandering the streets, I noticed that the streets were unually empty. Where were all the NPCs? No doubt the server was not responding now. I tried to / all to see how many people were on but nothing happened. Odd then that I was still on. Must be a bug. I will report it as soon as I get to a computer. Meanwhile I decided to take advantage of the situation. If the server was down, then I could just go into the stores and take all their stuff! After wandering around for a while (the city seems to have changed... its quite different from the Qeynos I know... Oh well, must be the newest patch. I finally found a big building and after entering it there were a bunch of shops inside. Wait a minute ... The only place I know of that was like that is the Erudin Palace! Did I somehow get to Odus? Hmm ... I don't remember going on a boat recently and there weren't any teleporter stones I saw..... I walked in one store, but there was an NPC there. I thought there weren't any NPCs if the server was back up. I tried to use the NPC to see what he had, but he backed off and said "Hey you can't do that!" I was confused. After I stood there for a few seconds he asked "Could I help you with anything?" Ah I think I know.. he must be an NPC with a quest. I Hailed him, and he responded "Hey. Are you looking for anything in particular?" Odd, he didn't use brackets, and none of the words seemed like they could trigger a quest. I tried "What particular ?", then "What anything ?" and even "What looking ?" But he just looked at me funny. There sure were a lot of bugs still in the game, I'm not sure if it will be ready by March 16th. I left the store, and I entered another store, except this one was really big and had a whole lot of colored cloth armor! I couldn't see very many NPCs, but there were more PCs here. I /shouted "Hey I'm gonna test a bug, so don't try to stop me ok?" One lady near me asked someone "What did he say?" and the Erudite she asked said "I dunno something about there being an insect there so don't try to stop him." Embarrassed at their well-roleplayed response to my out of character shout, I realized I really should have used /ooc. I grabbed a handful of cloth shirts and started to leave when the lady said "He's stealing the shirts!" Stealing ??? I'm PvP-, if they were her shirts then I wouldn't have been able to take them, and I SAID that I was just testing ... Maybe they didn't have /shouts turned on. I said "I'm just testing, relax." All of a sudden though, a bunch of high level guards showed up around me and I was afraid they were going to hit me for 50 odd damage or something, but for some reason all they did was ask me to put back the shirts. Darn those goodie-goodie Erudites! Always bragging about how THEIR city is completely at peace. As I was wandering around outside the Palace, I found quite a few coppers and silvers on the ground. This was better than fishing! I just wandered around picking up the money and I ended up with 53 coppers and 27 silvers. Hmm that's more than 3 gold! That was enough to buy a rusty weapon at least, since those Elite Guards back at the Mental Hospital stole my Morning Star. I finally found a Weapons shop. It seemed that All the weapons there were really old and rusty too .. Odd I would have though that they would sell normal weapons too. Oh well. I picked out a nice rusty mace and gave the NPC my silvers and a few coppers, but he seemed to think I was joking. "You can't buy an antique like that for a few bucks in change! These things are hundreds of dollars!" Dollars? Is that a fancy word for a platinum or something? Ridiculous! How can these Erudites possibly buy weapons for themselves? I wish I could gate back to Surefall, but my affinity was bound to the hospital.

How could I get to a gnomic computer?<BR>
