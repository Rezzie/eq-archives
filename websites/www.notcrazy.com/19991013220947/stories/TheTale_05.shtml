<B><I>Chapter Five: Meet Drakkus</i></B><BR><BR>

<p>The young lady finally appeared out of the forest, crossbow at her side.  "Maybe we do...say that was..."</p>

<p>Amalion quickly interrupted, "who are you?"</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>Amalion began attaching his wand harness again, only to look up and speak, "Amalion"</p>

<p>The woman pressed a button on the side of her crossbow, quickly it began to fold smaller and smaller until it became nothing more then a pin, she attached it to her tunic and answered with, "Reshie.  And as I was trying to say before that was pretty impressive, Amalion"</p>

<p>Amalion smirked, "thank you...I suppose.  Although your compliments seem to always lead to me losing items.  I also suppose I should introduce you to Icibus"  he nodded to the beautiful owl perched in the tree near by.</p>

<p>The owl hooted, "a pleasure m'lady Reshie, I am Icibus."</p>

<p>Reshie walked over to him amazed, "what a beautiful animal.  The soldiers were saying something about you being a high ranking official in a militia, what's that all about?"</p>

<p>Amalion straightened his robes and leaned against a tree, a few small electric charges still weaving themselves about his body, "it's a long story, and I'm tired..."</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" she spoke quickly, one eyebrow arched at him.</p>
</p>
<p>"Eh?  What?"
</p>
<p>"Your body...it's...sparking..."  she said hesitantly, not quite sure how to describe it.
</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm just regenerating my energy, my last spell took away quite a bit."  finally the sparking slowed, then stopped completely.
</p>
<p>"Oh...right...anyhow, can you tell me...a door..."
</p>
<p>"What?"  Amalion was completely confused now.
</p>
<p>"Look, a door"  Reshie pointed up behind Amalion and indeed a door seemed to be coming closer and closer to them, until it was finally right in front of Amalion.  Amalion backed up and the door continued to hang a few inches above the ground until finally it opened.  Out stepped a tall man, everything about him was dark, from his clothing to his complexion.  He was mammoth in front of Amalion, standing at least 6'6 and fairly built.
</p>
<p>"Ahh...the Sylvan.." he began as the door crumbled to nothing behind him "Amazing such a weak individual could defeat 8 of my top soldiers.  But then again I suppose you did have some help from her."  He looked over and gave Reshie a cold glance, "things could have been easy for you, but you decided to intervene with my plans, pity".
</p>
<p>Amalion folded his arms across his chest, "I'm guessing you sent them."
</p>
<p>The man smiled slightly and walked slowly around them, "oh yes, yes I did send them.  In fact, you could say I'm the man that you should be looking for, the one your men should be hunting, I am Drakkus.  I'm only telling you this because I say let them.  I've seen all of your skills in battle, and they are all...shall we say, mediocre."
</p>
<p>"This must be part of the long story you didn't bother to tell me yet." Reshie said, turning toward Armilion.
</p>
<p>Armilion looked to her, then looked back at the man, "mediocre eh?  Your soldiers didn't seem to think so."
</p>
<p>Drakkus smirked, "yes...I suppose your correct, so why aren't you trying to do the same thing to me?  Come now I know you are thinking about it."
</p>
<p>Armilion looked down and thought to himself, "he reads minds...some type of sorcerer..."
</p>
<p>Drakkus chuckled lightly, "I'm sorry to see that you classify me as a mere sorcerer Armilion."
</p>
<p>"He knows your name." said Reshie.</p>
</p>
<p>"I know everything about him, his techniques, his weaknesses, his fears."  Drakkus began to chuckle, "and I know that even if he wants to, he has no chance of saving any of you."
</p>
<p>Armilion growled, "that's it!" he put up both his hands and said, "Elemental Concussion!".  A huge wave of translucent energy pulsed from his hands almost knocking him to the ground.  It soared right through Drakkus and completely tore a tree from the ground behind him."
</p>
<p>"Drat!  A bloody hologram!"  Armilion roared.
</p>
<p>"So easily fooled"  Drakkus said.  "We shall meet in the future, I guarantee you."  With that his image faded into nothing and left Reshie and Armilion looking at each other.
</p>
<p>"I've got to warn Argmen" he said, looking toward Icibus, "Icibus, go and find Argmen, I'm guessing he's still at town, I'll fill Reshie in on everything while your doing that."
</p>
<p>"Yes sire" said Icibus, he then spread his wings and took off from his perch for town.</p>

<p>****************************************************************************</p>

<p>Argmen and Thorn were both seated at the town bar, laughing, joking, and altogether drunk.</p>

<p>"So anyway" started Thorn trying to speak clearly through his laughter, "she says to me, 'hey, your not my husband'".  Thorn and Argmen both broke out laughing, Thorn almost falling off his seat.</p>

<p>Argmen slapped Thorn's back, trying to stifle his laughter "oh gods...your not my husband, that was great".</p>

<p>Soon Argmen calmed down enough to where he could speak, "you did good before Thorn, I'm sorry I didn't congratulate you earlier."</p>

<p>"Thank you sir."  Thorn responded.</p>

<p>"Lemme tell ya, the way things were going, I didn't think I'd find anyone."  said Argmen.  Soon, Icibus flew into the tavern and landed at the bar by Argmen and Thorn.</p>

<p>"Oh, greetings Icibus" Argmen began, "want a drink?" Thorn and Argmen began laughing again at the very concept of offering an owl a drink.</p>

<p>"Err...no thank you sire...however, we do have a serious problem."  After Icibus said that, Argmen and Thorn stopped laughing, looked to each other, then looked back to Icibus.</p>
