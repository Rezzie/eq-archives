The primary focus of the Enchanter’s art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which he belongs: Enchanter. Their spells are crafted to enchant people, places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard. <BR><BR>
