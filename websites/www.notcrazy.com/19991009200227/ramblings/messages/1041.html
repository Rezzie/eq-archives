: Hmm,

: I saw the same corpse of a person for at least 3 days of playing.
: It was right outside of a Blacksmith shop and I tried to /tell the person 
: a couple times, but my guess is he was not on the game at all.

: I could not find my corpse one time when a friend and I were fighting side
: by side and he got his corpse but I could not find mine.  And I typed in something
: I saw on one of the message boards it was /corpse and I knew I was close and it 
: indeed summoned my corpse from wherever it was.  Maybe in a wall, or something odd.

: Also in my personal experience so far I have had hardly any trouble
: with many of the reported problems.  I've played since the 21st and
: got booted of twice that whole time.  But that is off topic.

: My suggestion go and get your corpse asap regardless.  I got killed
