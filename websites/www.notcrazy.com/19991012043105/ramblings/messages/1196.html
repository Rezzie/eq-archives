Many kindnesses were done me when I was truly new.  I am a 9th level Ranger and still (by the posters definiton hehehe) a newbie.  I am not ashamed of this.  I have heard the "buy me this??" and "can ya spare some change" from many..they get nothing.  I have given food and drink to the hungry and YES even a High Quality lion pelt to a mage of decent level...he was a nice guy and he didn't ask for it, he merely said he needed one and was hunting for it...I gifted it to him since I had one on me and could readily get more....he was most appreciative.  In fact he returned the good favor by hunting Willowwisps with me....I got a Greater Lightstone for a High Quality pelt.....not bad!!!!<br>Gifts are kewl, friends are made over a lost corpse....charity on the other hand breeds weakness, weakness breeds  "can you spare some money???"<p>Sorry I ramble....<br>Loving the game, faults and all!!!<p>Baesman<p>
