It hit me ... why was I being so stupid? How could I possibly get to a gnomic computer if I was on Odus? As I said before, gate would not work. I had to find a ship, but I didn't know my way around Erudin very well. I /shouted "Could anyone please help me find the docks?" No responses, although several people passed me by on the street I was standing in front of. What was with this cold treatment? Did a GM Broadcast about my exploitation if the shopping bugs? If so, that could mean I may be banned! Now I Must get to a clockwork computer. Meanwhile, I realized I was thirsty. I reached in my backpack to get a flask of water, but I had run out! Odd, I didn't get the "You are low on drink" message... I cast summon food... fizzled. I tried again, and it fizzled again. I wasted all my mana just fizzling on summon drink, but luckily I could meditate. I walked to the center of the street so that people would see that I was meditating and I sat down. <BR><BR>
When my mana was halfway full I was suddenly interrupted by a loud horn noise. I quickly replied "Can't you see I'm busy now?", but it kept horning and I even closed my spellbook, and when I looked up I saw what appeared to be a huge clockwork cart or something going really fast right into me. As the world faded to black I saw the "Loading please wait" message and waited to respawn at my home point.<BR><BR>
Great, just when I got to a place with clockwork stuff, possibly near Ak'Anon, I die and since my affiniy was bound to the Hospital I would start there again. All over again! At least I had nothing of value on my corpse except a few silver and copper, nothing more than I could recover quickly. I noticed, though, that when I opened my eyes I wasn't anywhere I recognized. A bunch of people were dressed in white, but there was a lot of clockwork stuff around me and the people looked different from the people in the Mental Hospital. Did I get my affinity bound to Ak'Anon somehow? All my questions would be answered in due time, as one of the head guys came to me and said "Congratulations we all thought you were a goner!"<BR>
"Who are you?"<BR>
"I'm 'Doctor' Clark, and this is nurse Thomas and Nurse Brand"<BR>
"Doctor? Is that what a cleric becomes when he turns level 50?"<BR>
"Uh ..."<BR>
"Does that mean I didn't die then? I don't seem to have lost any experience..."<BR>
He laughed. "No, you didn't die, but you got pretty close! You're lucky to be alive!"<BR>
I /bowed and /hugged targeting him, and he laughed some more. I started to stand up, but he said "No, you had better not walk for a couple days." I then noticed that I was covered in bandages and there were thin ropes coming out of me. Hey! This was just a little better than that mental hospital. Except this time I couldn't even walk around. I looked around the room, and to my surprise I did not see any posters of the Verant logo, I didn't see any photo collection on the wall of Brad McQuaid, and I didn't even see a Clockwork Playstation with 989 games! How could there be a room not dedicated to these greats? To pass the time, I set up my camp. It will take 30 more seconds to set up my camp .. It will take 25 more seconds to set up my camp ... It will take 20 more seconds to set up my camp .. It will take 15 more seconds to set up my camp ... It will take 10 more seconds to set up my camp .. It will take 5 more seconds to set up my camp ...<BR><BR>
Odd, I didn't log off! Ah to hell with these no walking rules. I'm already in Ak'Anon aren't I? I got up and switched from walk to run mode and started running down the hall, stripping the white cloak they had placed on me. "Hey! You can't go down the hall naked like that! Get some clothes on!" What was he talking about? "I'm still wearing my default newbie clothes, silly gnoll!" Just think, he was complaining about my clothes! Those gnolls are soo overdressed. He ought to check out a woodelf chick.. show him how over concerned his race is! <BR><BR>
I kept wandering around the hospital but for some reason everyone would scream and run away when they saw me... hehe silly gnolls have probably never even seen a human. Even though P4 did start a while ago, many newbies are still out there. I entered one room and after all the gnolls in that room ran out I saw what would be the next step to completing my quest for Lag : A clockwork computer. I sat down in front of it and waited for the Everquest splash screen that I'm sure *everyone* has replaced that stupid Win98 screen with but for some reason all the computer said was 'C:\>' What was this? Oh yeah I've head about this ... it's that zone called "DOS" ... Grrr... how do I get to the zone Windows 98? I bet this computer doesn't even have the system requirements for Everquest! This was useless. I left that room and started looking for more clockwork computers. Oh yeah! /emote hits self ... TRACKING! I hit my tracking hotkey and selected Clockwork Computer ... The clockwork computer is behind you and to the left... The clockwork computer is behind you ... Found one! And it was already in zone "Windows 98"! but what was this? "Please enter your screensaver password". Ok... that must mean my Sony Station account password ...I typed it in but nothing happened ! Maybe they meant my account key ... (and no I'm not telling you THAT all you P4 wannabes!) I typed it in and it still didn't work... hmm maybe it's someone else's password. Ok, time for random guesswork! <BR><BR>
<i><B>****11 days 3 hours and 43 minutes later *****</b></I><BR>
Yes! I am out of food and drink, I am hungry, I am thirsty, my Stamina bar has fell to zero, my mana bar is at a quarter bubble and my hit points are at half a bubble and falling, but I MADE IT IN! Now to ask Brad McQuaid about the lag... I posted it on all the message boards I could find and am awaiting his response now.<BR>
