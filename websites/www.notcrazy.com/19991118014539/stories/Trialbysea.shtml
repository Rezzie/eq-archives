Quellious's Trial by Sea<BR><BR>

As a child in the Erudin City it was hard growing up a follower of Quellious. Most of my Enchater school chums where agnostic or worshiped Prexus. As an Erudite surrounded by water one could see the worship of the
Ocean Lord a great profit. Now I do pay my respects to Prexus but my soul belongs to Quellious. I have always wondered if in my faith would be tested. I believe it was this wondering that brought me to my test.  <BR><BR>

It was a cold and rainy night. I was out in the toxic forest with a Human Monk visiting form Quynos. As we walk in the night air discussing the finer point of philosophy we noticed an undead abomination and went to remove it from this plane of existence. On the way we became lost in the toxic woods. My lamp could not penetrate the dark vial that cloaked the toxic forest. I knew that if I found the shores I would be able to navigate my way back to the city. With my Monk friend close behind we began looking for the coast. It did not take long and we began following the beach.  I held the lamp and told my friend to say close behind me and under my breath I said Prexus would guide us to Erudin. It was only seconds after saying that that I crested a hill and splash!
Everything went dark I could not see. I knew I was in the water I quickly began to swim up. It was deep cold and unforgiving. I could see nothing it was without doubt a horror. Unable to see and with in the womb of the sea I swam in circles only barley able to keep my head above water.  I had to think. I knew I could not swim all night, I am no warrior my strength comes form mind. I know the shore had to be some where. I could hear distant
echoes of my Monk friend yelling form the shore but the waves muffle his vice so I could not use it as a beacon. I felt some security in knowing that my friend was not in the same predicament. I began to tier, each stroke
became harder and harder. Then out of the corner of my eye I could see a light. I began moving to it thinking that it could be the shore when I heard it coon and screech. As a child I heard stories of eels that where
electrified but this was not time to investigate. 
I was slowly becoming over crowded by the chaos of my predicament. I would rest in Prexus arms before the sun would rise. Who know how far I had swam, was I near the shore, would I be attack by Prexus children from the
deep. I was in this moment of chaos that Quellious's light began to shine in my hart. If I allowed the chaos to consume me it would. I focused looked deep inside myself until I felt the calm of order, focus and peace with in me. In just a few strokes I felt land under my feet and I slowly left the water and with my apprehensions of my true faith. I trust only in the true
light and the peace it can bring. So I hope my little story illustrates that you should never doubt you faith. Oh and don't walk around ocean cliffs at night.<BR><BR>
