<p>The bright glow of the Xystran moons filled the square as Lilan slowly walked home,
smiling to herself with pride. It had been a difficult task for her parents to convince
the village elders to teach her the secrets of her people, the arcane mysteries which had
saved her kind so long ago. She couldn't believe her happiness, though; just two years ago
she had wished for death at the thought of being enrolled in such a boring, forgotten
field of study. Now she smiled at the thought of doing well. <em>Unbelievable</em>, she
thought.</p>

<p>She was so lost in thought she barely noticed the shrill wind echoing in her ears. Her
footing followed the familiar path, even though she was barely conscious of the stones
beneath her feet. She daydreamed, smiling to herself occasionally, ignorant of the outside
world. She was so engrossed in her thoughts that she didn't realize how sleepy and tired
she was getting...&nbsp; Her steps slowed and became awkward, her head became heavy as her
breathing became deeper. She was having trouble keeping her eyes open until the first
pains of nausea swept over her.&nbsp; Her eyes shot open in icy panic.</p>

<p>She could barely move, let alone struggle, as she was lifted off the ground. It felt
like some powerful hand gripped her, squeezing her neck, choking her, as she coughed and
wheezed for breath. The pain moved down her back, along her spine, as she darted her eyes
back and forth to clear her clouded head. She saw whirls of color racing past her
downwards, blots of light and dark plummeting below.&nbsp; Tears streamed from her eyes to
be swept away in the torrent of wind as she hurtled to ... where?&nbsp; <em>What is this?
&nbsp; Why is it doing this to me?</em></p>

<center><img src="http://www.notcrazy.com/images/bar.jpg" width=99%></center>

<p>Blackness, emptiness, soothed and consoled her.&nbsp; The void of nothingness, where no
pain, no anxiety, reached her.&nbsp; Slowly the darkness took shape, blurring into a dull
grey image, and Lilan became aware of the first sounds to reach her since the ordeal had
begun.&nbsp; It came rushing back in bits and pieces; each new noise and new blurry,
confused image that pierced her mind brought a flash of the painful memory back.&nbsp; But
where was she going when <em>it</em> happened?&nbsp; What was she doing?&nbsp; She could
not recall so many things for some reason, and she had no idea how much time had
passed....</p>

<p>She became aware of how cold her face was.&nbsp; Cold and sore.&nbsp; She cracked her
eyelids open to reveal a dark stone before her, against the side of her cheek.&nbsp; As
she blinked to focus she became acutely aware of the scent of incense and the stench of
burnt flesh.&nbsp; <em>What is this?</em> </p>

<p>&quot;Arise, servant!&quot; shrieked an odd voice.&nbsp; Lilan summoned the strength to
lift her head and gazed at the source.&nbsp; It was an odd creature, thin, pale, and
wrinkled... &quot;In accordance with the Rituals, I bring thee forth to do my
bidding!&quot;&nbsp; It had no hair on its head, but only a thin few strands along the
sides of its head, which was so obscene...&nbsp; There were no horns!&nbsp; No scales or
plates, only a grossly smooth, tan skin.&nbsp; Lilan shuddered in horror as she looked
into the thing's eyes, which blinked in fury.&nbsp; <em>It has round pupils...</em> she
thought in disgust as it spoke again.&nbsp; &quot;Zsikthian Demon, I bring you forth on
this plane to do my bidding for a term of no less than 24 hours!&quot;&nbsp; <em>This was
going to be a long day...</em></p>
