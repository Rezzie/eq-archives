Hello everyone,<BR><BR

As the time of the beta nears, I find myself jumping every time the phone rings. The sheer anticipation of becoming a part of this project is almost more than this one soul can handle. I, like most of you, have been waiting for a truly engrossing MMUD to come on the scene. Many companies have tried to do this, but none have yet succeeded. <BR><BR>

I, and I am sure most of you, hope to become a part of the beta. Should any of you be accepted to the project, I wanted to write a short article concerning the utter importance of well-written correspondence with SISA. <BR><BR>

There is a saying that the "squeaky wheel gets the oil". This saying used to be true back when you had to meet with someone face to face, or when you at least had to talk over the phone. In today's digital age, there could be nothing further from the truth. I remember back in the days of UO when an issue would become important to various people. It was a common occurrence to see literal all-cap messages appear on the message boards about how a particular problem needed to be fixed. I saw numerous copies of email sent to the support staff laden with insults and threats concerning how a particular bug needed to be fixed. <BR><BR>

Offensive and threatening emails are much easier to delete without reading. I'm not saying that the SISA staff will aim to do this, but I can say that they will pay closer attention to email written with thought and courtesy than shorthand filled screams about how a game will fail if they do not "fix this bug". <BR><BR

Everyone likes to feel that their email is read and considered. I'd like to include a few steps below to insure it will be.<BR><BR

1. First and foremost, your responsibility as a beta tester is to report bugs. A bug can be anything from something that doesn't function as expected, to something that just doesn't function at all. Pay close attention to posts by the SISA crew to make sure you don't waste time by reporting a bug that was already explained very well. If you find a post on an internal testers site that was explained incorrectly, or just not very well, feel free to post an update.<BR><BR>

2. Establish a reputation as a good and invaluable source of information. When you find a bug, try to find out if there are any special circumstances that allow the bug to be easily reproduced. The first step helping a programmer to fix a perceived problem is to make it easy to reproduce. I work very closely with software developers everyday. I can say with some confidence that an the hard-to-reproduce bugs are always back-burnered in favor of those that are easily reproduced. You can never include too much information in a report. However, keep in mind that developers are busy and can often "get the idea" in but a few bullet points. Start your messages a description of the bug. The description should be concise to get their attention. The title, "Dwarven dagger causes an extreme amount of damage", would be a nice concise description of the problem, whereas "Problem with Dwarven Dagger" would not be. Follow your title with step by step numbered instructions on how to reproduce the bug. With any bug, it is possible that there may be additional factors that may or may not have an effect on the reproducibility of the bug. Your next section should be a list of those factors. The contributing factors may include such things as time of day, location in the world, any armor your character may be wearing, your level at the time, or anything else you feel may be helpful. Finally, include a first person account detailed account on how you came across the bug. If you have done your job in the previous sections, the chances are that the developers will not need to read this far, but if they do, it's nice to have the information available. Finally, include at the bottom of every post the times which you can be found on-line, as well as your email address. Don't make the staff have to look your information up if they need to ask you more questions.<BR><BR>

3. Stay away from words like "useless" and vague comments like "it doesn't work". Leave no doubt about what you actually mean. If your messages are consistently vague, there is a possibility that they will not get the attention they deserve. SISA is in the game to make money. If they can read and mentally design fixes for three well described bugs in the time that it takes to figure out what you may be trying to say, your time and theirs will be wasted.<BR><BR>

4. If you begin to feel like your comments are getting ignored, a brief follow-up can be helpful. I would suggest to SISA that they make it a habit to respond to every bug report in either a public or private forum. If you don't see such a follow up, either they haven't gotten to your request yet, they may have solved it, or they didn't feel that it was an issue. A short note asking if you can be of any further help on that "Dwarven Dagger/extreme damage" problem should be welcomed by the team.<BR><BR>

5. Remember that as beta testers you are part of the team. You are on the team with the developers and every other tester in the program. Playstyles should not be an issue in the beta, since, after all, you are not there to play. There is no reason for any discourtesy in your exchanges with your fellow testers. People who know they will be arch-enemies with a certain tester once the game goes final should be able to work closely each other. SISA will not tolerate using their time to carry out grudges. Work together, it can only help in the end. After the game goes final, feel free to kill each other.<BR><BR>

6. Don't be afraid to try anything. Death is not something to fear in the beta. The SISA team will undoubtedly bestow high levels upon players from time to time to test balance issues as the game progresses. They most certainly will be reducing the levels from time to time as well. It is SISA's prerogative to change any character in any manner they see fit for the purpose of testing. If you log in and find yourself naked, do not be alarmed. If there is some information to suggest that this was purposeful, go deal with it the best you can. If there is no such sign, submit a bug report.<BR><BR>

7. There will undoubtedly be some classes and races that aren't chosen by many people for the purpose of testing. They still need to be tested. If you see a shortage of a particular race or class, take the initiative and create one of the lesser used combos. Don't make SISA have to come request it from you. Treat it as a contest. If there is a shortage of gnome warriors (gnome warriors?), there will definitely be a few bugs with that particular combo. He who reports the most bugs in a mature, highly descriptive form, wins.<BR><BR>

SISA knows that the success of the game depends on a successful beta test. No game or application has been successful without such a test, especially games in this genre. EverQuest's success relies on you, the tester. I believe that if all of the testers follow my advice laid out above, EverQuest will truly be the best RPG to hit the market, now, past, or anywhere on the horizon.<BR><BR>
