<B><I>Excellent Butcherbloc Map</I></B><BR>
<B><I>1:58:35 PST</I></B><BR>
I just got this <b><i>*VERY EXCELLENT*</i></b> map in from Teshia of <a href="/collated/maps/zones/Faydwer/Butcherblock.shtml">Butcherblok Mountains</a>. There are two versions; a VERY LARGE version suitable for printing and another more suitable for display here. Thanks a load Teisha, and Congrats on a job well done.
<p><blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
Greetings!
 
<p>I am submitting this map to all major Everquest web sites.  It's a map of the Butcherblok Mountains.
 
<p>What separates it from other maps of the Butcherblok is that it is drawn in a style somewhat similar to that of the maps that appear in the Everquest game manual, except that it has more detail.
 
<p>I have taken some great time to do this drawing and I would greatly appreciate it if you give credit for the map where credit is due.  It was done by Teshia of the Xegony Server, a female human ranger from Surefall Glade.  Teshia, myself, is also a member of the guild United Norrath (http://unitednorrath.webjump.com).
 
<p>The two maps I've included are the same map, in varying qualities.  One (bm1200.jpg) is a 1200 pixel wide map suited for display on web sites.  To shrink it any lower takes a lot out of the map, as it has a lot of detail on it, due to the size of the area.  The larger format (pmpage.jpg) is 10 inches wide (much higher quality) and more suited for people who want to print it out.
 
<p>Hope to see it on your web site in the near future.  If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me back.
 
<p>Teshia (Xegony Server)
<br>13th Level Female Human Ranger</font></blockquote>

<B><I>12:13:16 PST</I></B><BR>
I just got this in from Smedley about an informal get together which EQ players are invited to. Catch is, you gotta be 21 because its in a bar. If only I were 10 months older....
<p><blockquote><font color="silveR" size="-1">
Everquest Players,

<p>Anyone in the San Diego area (or anyone that would want to drive on down
from LA or elsewhere) - If you are interested in meeting members of the
development team (and you are 21 or over) , we will be at the Karl Strauss
Brewery on Scranton Road here in San Diego this Friday May 7th from 6pm to
9pm. Feel free to drop on in and meet us. We want to keep this pretty
informal. This is not a Verant sponsored event, but a completely informal
gettogether.

<p>In the future we plan on doing Player Lunches and other get togethers.

<B><I>New Patch</I></B><BR>
<B><I>7:12:29 PST</I></B><BR>
This patch was just activated last night:

<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">

May 4th, 8:30pm<br>
---------------
<p>
The login difficulties that you may have been encountering over the past 1.5 hours have been resolved. We were able to pinpoint and fix
a major bug which has been plaguing the login procedure for quite some time. Now that this problem has been addressed, the login process should be carried out much more swiftly. We apologize for the inaccessibility of the EverQuest servers for this short time, however, this fix should insure future stability.
<p>
We have included a revised version of the EverQuest Manual in this patch which includes an amendment to various skills, spells and other game play releated features.  The section briefly outlines the modification, introduction, and removal of various features found in EverQuest.  This information may also be found at www.everquest.com in the "In Development" section located in "Features".  Both of these will be updated on a regular basis.

<B><I>4:4:26 PST</I></B><BR>
Here's a bit of the new information in the manual, it's near the bottom, and it looks like the future might actually have a light at the end for the rogue class.
<br>
<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
SKILLS<br>
Disarm Traps -- Clarification<br>
The Disarm Traps skill only works on moving traps (i.e. Not invisible walls, floors, etc.)  Disarm traps is activated by clicking on a moving trap.  Messages indicating whether the skill was successfully activated (which is based both on the player's skill level and the type of trap) will be added shortly.<p>

Sense Traps - Clarification<br>
The Sense Traps skill only works on moving traps (i.e. Not invisible walls, floors, etc.).<p>

Make Poison - New Functionality<br>
The Make Poison skill will be implemented as a trade skill in the future.  It will be similar to other trade skills, and will involve combining poison components to create various types of poisons.<p>

Apply Poison - New Functionality<br>
The Apply Poison skill will be implemented such that a character will be able to apply a poison in his inventory temporarily to his or her primary weapon.  The effect of successfully hitting an opponent and successfully applying poison will vary depending on the type of poison used.<p>

Specialization - New Functionality<br>
The various Specialization skills will be implemented such that if a spell is cast in, for example, the abjuration family, the Specialization - Abjuration skill will be checked (if present) and if successful, will decrease the amount of mana used to cast the spell.   The Specialization skills are as follows:  Specialization - Abjuration, Specialization - Alteration, Specialization - Conjuration, Specialization - Divination, and Specialization - Evocation.<br>

<B><I>15:46:26 PST</I></B><BR>
We received this from Holly regarding a Race War on Rallos Zek:

<blockquote><font color="silver" size="-1">
<p>
On Saturday May 8 1999, Darkenbane and The Horde will launch an attack on Freeport and surroundings zones between 10PM and Midnight EST (7PM and 9PM
PST). We cannot give you the exact time, since this is a war.
<p>
As one of the larger and better-known guilds on Rallos Zek, I feel we should take the initiative in building a community. Many of our attacks are not announced, but I know there are many roleplayers out there who have wished
to battle us. Here is our announcement.
<p>
I will contact GMs to see about the possibility of turning off the Griffins and Guards in ECommons for a few hours (or the GMs can contact me).
<p>

Saro just sent me in this nice map of Nektulos Forest. It has become obvious to me now that some of what Brad said is true. The population is spreading out. There are more people in higher level areas and this has become aparrant in that we are starting to see more maps of the higer level areas.

The <a href="/collated/maps/zones/Antonica/NektulosForest.shtml">Nektulos Forest</a> maps and a wealth of other information can be found in the <a href="/collated">collated information</a> section.
