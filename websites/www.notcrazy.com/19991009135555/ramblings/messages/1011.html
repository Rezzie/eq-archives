: While logged on your corpse lasts 8 hours.  While logged off at level 1 it lasts 1 hour, Level 2 - 5 it lasts 8 hours, level 6+ it lasts 7 days.  Note the last 3 times listed are ONLY if you're not logged in.<p>BS. My brother died in BB with a 8th level char and returned in 3 hours only to find it gone. He petitioned the penis gm named Trok who, in his typically helpfull and informative capacity, said "corpses deteriorate faster". On another note Trok forced a friend to change his name and hardly gave his 6th level character a chance to pick it, turning down 3 and then just giving him some bogus one. Hmmm.... 6th level thats about what 2 or 3 days of playing min. What a prick. I am so impressed with all of the Verant support structure. Nice downtime section on their webpage too. Bout as usefull as a fridge in an igloo.<br>
