Last week, my Jeep was broken into, My stereo, my Palm Pilot, radar detector, and 20 of my favoirte CDs were all stolen. After the deductables on the various forms of insurance (indsurance is a joke BTW, if it werent required by law, I wouldnt bother with it) was taken into account, I was out a good 800+ Bucks. Which got me to thinking how lame some people are. The people that broke into my jeep werent particularily bright. First, they tried to key the lock on the door (thus ruining the lock) and then they decided to cut the top on my jeep to get in. Then they tried to break in the center console (which wasnt locked in the first place).<BR><BR>
By now, Im sure you have one question, <B>What exactly am I getting at?</B> I got to think about how much alike these mornic, lamers who broke in my jeep, and the lamers who exploited the bugs in UO to get into house to steal another persons hard earned loot. Both are too damn lazy to go out and get a job of some sort to be able to get all the stuff on their own. The only thing that you can take into account to make you feel better about the situation is that by their actions they are admitting that you are better than they are. And they arent good enough to get the items on their own.<BR><BR>
I wouldnt have a problem with the people taking the equipment if they did it fairly. If they stayed within allowances of the game (some would argue that bugs are witihin the allowances of the game, but you all know better than that, because they are NOT meant to be there) I would have no problem, other be upset that I lost a lot of hard work to someone who earned it from me. For example. I would have no problem if someone ran up, killed me in front of my house (in UO or EQ or whatever,I would have a major problem with that in real life), took the keys to my house, went in, and stole everything. They earned it. They got in fairly. But people who run up to the house as a ghost, have someone ressurect them, and then step into the house before selecting "ressurect now" are just lame, and are no better than the thieves who broke into my car.<BR><BR>
By now Im sure you have a second question.. <B>What does all this have to do with EverQuest?</B><BR>
Well.. First and foremost, Thievery should be fair. If a person opts to be a theif in the game, their stealing capabilities should not be limited to wether or not the person is flagged as a pk or not. There should be one exception to this, and that is if the person is non pk. If they are non pk, they should only be allowed to steal from NPCs and other Non-pks, since a pk can not retaliate against a non-pk. But if the person is pk, they should be able to steal from anyone, since pks can retaliate, and non-pks wouldnt be able to retaliate anyways, since they cannot attack anyone, not just one specific group of people.<BR><BR>
 Rogues (thieves) should also have the ability to climb walls. Now, i dont mean they should be able to go climb the world trade center, but they should be able to climb trees and climb over walls, or climb onto the roof of a small house. What they can climb should basically depend on the surface they are trying to climb, for example, a brick wall is easier to climb than a wooden wall. <BR><BR>
Bards should also be adept at climbing, but not as good at it s the rogue. Bards are travellers. They climb hills and mountains just to get wherever they are going. Bards should also be a useful, undespensable class. Their songs should all sound unique, not just a few chords that are only good at annoying people. The songs should also have very useful and noticable effects on party members or others in the area. For those of you who have played <i>The Four Crystals of Trazere</I> know how indespensable the bard was. It should be the same in EverQuest. Bards should not be like they were in UO. They should actually be useful.<BR><BR>
