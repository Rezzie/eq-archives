In Reply to: Treatise on EQ vs. UO posted by Faust of Pagan Magic Research on May 13, 1998 at 18:03:49:<BR>
<BR>
Nae having the time that ye seem t'have on yer hands, here's a brief and brutal reply t'yer extensive discourse ;)
<BR><BR>
"The corpse of the slain will NOT be lootable, according to the EverQuest FAQ"
<BR><BR>
Nae true. It does state the PvP's cannae loot nPvP's. But that dinnae mean PvP's cannae loot each other. Brad has said that there will be negative impacts to looting. So obviously it'll be around.
<BR><BR>
"It will be nice to enter a dragons lair and observe the number of dead bodies strewn about.... maybe."
<BR><BR>
Definitely ;) I'm reminded of the early days of the Beta, where a dragons lair was easily distinguishable by the circle of piles of loot around it. There were 1000's of gp in loot in small, body sized piles all around. THAT'S a dragons lair!
<BR><BR>
"Given this, the combinations of all these variables increases the likelihood that there will be SOME combination that is superior to all others."
<BR><BR>
Nae necessarily. There will be combos that are "best" in certain circumstances, but that willnae be the rule. EQ differs from UO in one very important manner. You willnae necessarily be forced t'play a certain way just t'survive. Ye can play a Bard that tunes and sings and interacts and travels all ye wish. As long as ye avoid the monsters, yer bloody invulnerable, assuming yer nPvP. All the Tank Mages or EQ equivalent in the world cannae do anything about ye. The Tank Mage arose out of the need to survive outside of the city, regardless o'yer profession. Blacksmith, Ranger, etc…ye had t'be a Tank Mage just t'walk from Vesper t'Minoc. That'll nae be the case in EQ.
<BR><BR>
"One of the ONLY ways to avoid this problem is to REQUIRE a variety of players/character types to perform even the most routine of tasks such as the Dungeon Crawl."
<BR><BR>
Both the FAQ and Brad have insinuated strongly in this direction, and I heartily hope it happens. I'm hoping that there are quests that only a varied party can complete. One o'the biggest examples (and one o'my personal hatreds) in UO was that EVERYONE could pick locks. Exactly why should anyone have a thief when any Joe Blow can pay 10gp for a lockpick, pick the always-locked crates in the provisioner for a quick 15% lockpicking, then open anything in the dungeons. I want GRUESOME traps to deter fighters from thinking they can open treasure chests. I want it to be a requirement that a thief be in the group. To accomplish this, I'll play a lone thief that follows parties without thieves and open the stuff they can't. Since I'll be nPvP, I'll hide from monsters and let them kill them, and loot the things they cannae ;)
<BR><BR>
"Why? Very simply, magic was the basis of power and these unplayed classes had no magic to speak of."
<BR><BR>
What if mages cannae unlock magically? What if only clerics can heal? That's the advantage of specialization….it forces people t'rely upon the diversity. I'm hoping there will be many magic-proof monsters that require a warriors touch. For example, I hope dragons are bloody immune to magic. You stand back on a cliff and drop fireballs on it…it chuckles and blows the mountain side away w'ye on it ;)
<BR><BR>
"So now were talking about a game that is 100% 3D on a platform required to be a P266. Why do you think that you need this huge capability? More data to process and more information to deal with. What causes lag? Data transfer slow downs."
<BR><BR>
Wrong, Wrong, Wrong. First off, the more intense the graphic engine, the LESS the data flow traffic. No scenery information will be sent down the bloody wire! This is the biggest misconception about EQ and one that needs t'bloody stop. All that will be sent down the wire is your coords, everyone else in your "areas" coords, and their actions. No trees, no walls, no nothing. All of that is on the CD and is rendered on yer system around yer coords. The system knows where ye are, tells yer client, and yer client builds all o'the surroundings around ye. THAT's why ye need the big hardware. It's called a thick client, or a distributed processing environment. Your machine does all the work. The server just keeps score. Ye tell it what ye do, it tells ye what happens, and yer machine builds yer surroundings.
<BR><BR>
"One of the things we notice about UO's fatal lag is that, according to OSI, the existence of MORE STUFF such as tools, treasure and all the "things" in the world. More items on a character or in his bank equated to more problems going from server to server."
<BR><BR>
This should clue ye in that lag has VERY little t'do with the internet, bandwidth, or other such claptrap. UO's servers sucked at keeping track o'objects. The more objects, the slower the system. Ye can see that clearly on the dungeon level. If it's full o'crap, everything is slow. If ye put all the crap on bodies and it decays, the server speeds up tremendously and respawns like mad. Hopefully, Sony is using better hardware than the 386sx/16MHz that OSI was using.
<BR><BR>
"Increasing the number of "things" increases the number of calculations each time that thing has to do something like move."
<BR><BR>
Nae necessarily. If Sony is smart, they'll just keep everything in an object database with properties. Who/what/where/when/how are all properties and attributes of the object. If the location changes, it's a simple field change. I'm over simplifying, obviously, but I've designed and administered database systems that kept track of millions of "objects" and saw no degredation do to load.
<BR><BR>
"a fully 3D game has got to have significantly more data attached to each THING because its got a polygonal structure made up of hundreds of points to create it... often thousands! Will this increase or decrease lag?"
<BR><BR>
No, No, No. An object is an object. Your CD will ship with a dozen or so sword templates and attributes for lighting, colour, and texture. The only thing that will come down the wire will be "O=ABC" which equates to Object A (the sword) Object B (the colour) Object C (the texture), etc. The engine on your system will take that information and build what it needs on your system. No, I'm nae a game designer, nor do I work for Sony. But I've designed many interactive systems and the only SANE thing to do in a large user base is use a thick client, put as much as possible on the client side, and just send updates. It's easier, too, though revision updates can be a bit cumbersome and will take space on the client hard drive…but what the heck, Sony is nae responsible for my having t'upgrade my hardrive ;)
<BR><BR>
"EQ states that lag/fast connections will not effect combat and melee situations. Essentially the descriptions of such activities are that you get in range of the target, turn on "fight" mode and sit back and watch the combat. This sounds a little boring. I cannot believe that there are no personal tactics involved in the best way to effectively fight something."
<BR><BR>
Only way it can be done, boyo. If ye've played Quake, ye'll understand how important it is t'nae make this a "twitch" game. I am what is rather affectionately referred too in Quake terms as a HPB, or sub Hundred Ping Bastard. I'm constantly circling and killing people with slower connections than I simply because I can get my coords refreshed faster than they can. And, keep in mind, that monsters ALWAYS have zero ping ;)
<BR><BR>
This said, there are still MANY ways to use tactics within the game, assuming Sony attempted to include some. For example, archers should be more effective firing down upon people. Fighting in dark should be limiting, even if the player can see by cranking their brightness up all the way. There will always be positional and environmental concerns to be used to one's advantage, if yer creative enough ;)
<BR><BR>
"Further, this may work just fine for a swordsman with little else to offer himself, but does this mean that magic users will automatically cast the best spell for a given situation in every instance?"
<BR><BR>
Of course not. Mages will cast spells as they wish, effective or nae. In this, those that can macro the commands will be able t'get spells off faster, making magic use a "twitch" aspect like it was in UO, but I dinnae see how that could be avoided. The alternative is the mage casting his spells automatically, which begs the point "Why are we playing when the character is doing it all himself?" ;)))
<BR><BR>
"a) Prepare for extreme harassment. This will allow someone the ability to walk into another persons "area" and begin cussing him out and nobody (no PC anyway) can do anything about it. Imagine yourself sitting in your own personal guild hall with your own stuff and your own friends. Mr. Non-PvP wanders in and starts helping himself to your stuff... what are you going to do about it?"
<BR><BR>
Already covered in my earlier posts. I plan to test the stuffing out of this aspect, being the single most annoying person in the game until I understand fully what is capable o'being done. If I dinnae make it into the Beta, I'll test during production. I see this as the single most vulnerable point o'the game, in my humble opinion. Things like blocking people in, stealing experience by taking shots at monsters that a group is attacking, etc all have been posted earlier. Any way, shape, form or fashion that I can adversely effect other players as an nPvP, or harm nPvP's while I'm PvP will be my #1 priority.
<BR><BR>
"EQ Staff assures us that the gate/recall ability for PC's will be extremely difficult. In my opinion the spell recall ruined UO worse than anything else."
<BR><BR>
Cannae argue w'ye there. I, for one, think that only mages should be able t'do this, and only VERY high level mages should be able t'move others. Everyone else bloody walks. As long as it's even remotely exciting t'get someone where (risks of bandits/monsters/etc), that willnae be too bad.
<BR><BR>
"Existing guilds are going to have hard time and only the foolhardy will read the limited details on the EQ web page and make a determination about how and who they are going to be based on that."
<BR><BR>
Good. I dinnae think too highly o'Guilds anyway. Especially guilds that have formed before the bloody game is in Beta. They are politics for it's own sake, IMHO.
<BR><BR>
Whew
<BR><BR>
That's a lot o'typing ;)
