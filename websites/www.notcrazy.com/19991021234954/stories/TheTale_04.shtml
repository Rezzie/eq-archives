<B><I>Chapter Four: Stop Thief!</B></I>

<p>Amalion saw her stare back at him, their eyes were fixed on each other for a few moments.  He got a rather good look at her, she was at least as tall as he was and appeared human.  Her hair was golden as the sands, and her eyes changed their tone in the glimmering light.  Her dress looked a bit rustic, hand fashioned cloth tunic, long leather boots that almost came up to her knees, and a type of patchwork pants.  Finally she broke the silence.

<p>"I'm terribly sorry sir...I didn't know what..."

<p>Quickly he cut her off, "no no...you couldn't have known and I thought I was alone...".

<p>She answered almost immediately after, "I should have guessed that..." she stopped and blushed a bit seeing they were both babbling to each other, Amalion couldn't help but chuckle a bit.  She noticed that in the mist of everything, he was still laying on top of her, "Um...would you mind kindly getting off of me?" she smiled up at him slightly.

<p>"Oh yes of course, sorry bout that"  quickly he picked himself up off the ground and extended a hand down to help her up.

<p>She grinned, took his hand and together they lifted her up, "thank you, but it wasn't so bad, your really not that heavy you know".

<p>Amalion was in the middle of brushing himself off until he stopped hearing those words, "err...thank you...I think...".

<p>She giggled slightly, "don't worry I meant it as a compliment.  So I know your not human...elven?  And a magician yes?" 

<p>Amalion swept his hair back from his eyes and took a seat back on the ground, "aye, well Sylvan actually...err and a wizard"

<p>"Ooooh" She looked genuinely impressed, "a wizard eh?  that's interesting..."  she said, sitting down beside him on the edge of the cliff.  "The sun looks beautiful over the water today, doesn't it?"  She nodded her head lightly in the direction of the ocean.

<p>He squinted his eyes and turned to look at it, truly it was a very beautiful day out, also very hot though.  Either way it was a good day to be outside.  "Yes your right it is...say, do you..."  he turned back to look at her, but she was nowhere to be found.  Amalion was extremely puzzled, where'd she go so fast?  And why?  "that's odd...such a nice girl too...wait...somethings wrong here..."  indeed something did feel wrong, he just didn't know what it was yet.  "I just can't...wait a minute..."  he then checked the inside of his robes, finding his money pouch and his wand harness was gone.  Amalion stood up slowly and said to noone in particular, "ok...I've been robbed...but I'm ok with this...I'm not going to get angry...oh who am I bloody kidding."

<p>He threw back his head and yelled, "Icibus! Come!".  A few moments went by and nothing happened, "where is that blasted flying chicken."  Then out of the corner of his eye, he saw an owl making it's way toward him in the sky, soon it landed beside him and fluttered it's feathers about.  "Icibus, I need to you find the woman I was just speaking with.  She seems to have relieved me of a few possessions", Amalion tried to stay calm, knowing his own temper this wasn't easy.

<p>Icibus hooted quietly, "that doesn't suprise me..."

<p>"WHAT!?"  Amalion shouted, his eyes wide.

<p>Quickly Icibus covered his last comment, "nothing sire, I'm just incredibly suprised she was actually able to get past your uncanny reflexes and perception".

<p>"Your lying is terrible...no matter, go find her, contact me when you do"

<p>Icibus preened himself a bit before replying, "yes sire".  Quickly he launched himself up into the sky and took off.  Leaving Amalion standing by the sea cliff, he smirked to himself and said softly, "little minx".

<p>****************************************************************************

<p>She sat down on a flat rock, half out of breath and began fingering through the items she had stolen from Amalion.  "30 pieces of gold, I never thought a wizard made such a poor living."  It wasn't long before she opened up his wand harness.  She began to remove the many wands inside, they were of all shapes and sizes.  From gnarled wooden ones to slender metallic ones.  

<p>A moment later she saw a beautiful owl land on a tree branch next to her.  "What a glorious animal" she though, little knowing it was Amalion's pet.

<p>The young lass continued sorting through the contents of the harness when she heard something in the woods around her.  "Foot steps?" she thought, "could it be the Sylvan?".  "No...it's too many foot steps..."

<p>Soon she saw several beings appear from the depth of the forest, at least 8 from what she could see, soon they surrounded her.  They looked like some types of warriors.  They're brigadine was pretty standard, some wielded axes, some different types of swords and shields.  They didn't look very friendly.

<p>She began to slowly put the wands back into the harness and said, "can I...help you gentlemen?".

<p>"Yes...yes you can..." one said as he approached her.  She guessed he was the leader of whoever these people were.  He was largely built, broad shoulders,  dark braided beard, at his side was a massive greataxe.  "You were with the Sylvan...tell us what you know of him."

<p>She arched an eyebrow at him, "why would you care?  I just robbed the poor sap, I didn't start any conversations with him or anything".

<p>He chuckled slightly with the rest of the men following behind him, "right...you expect me to believe you just went to the Unit Leader of a growing military force just to rob him?  Come now do we look like fools to you?"

<p>She shrugged and spoke to him, "in this lighting, it's hard to tell".

<p>"How dare you speak to me like that!  This grows tiresome, grab her, we'll take her to the General, she can have a talk with him."  The other 7 men began to approach her, quickly she stood and pulled two gleaming dirks from inside her tunic.

<p>****************************************************************************

<p>Amalion stared out at the ocean, rubbing his chin slightly when suddenly he flinched as he was contacted by Icibus, "sire, I've found the young woman".

<p>"Splendid job Icibus!  Let me see through your eyes."  Then Amalion got a vision, a distant picture coming from Icibus' eyes.  "Who are those men around her?  What's happening?".

<p>He heard Icibus' thoughts reach him, "apparently someone knows your a rather high ranking official in the militia, since she talked with you they're trying to extract information from her.  Perhaps you should come to help her?"

<p>Amalion sighed, he wasn't sure what to think, "well...she did steal from me, punishment is in order..."

<p>"I agree wholeheartedly sire, but perhaps you can just deal with her yourself, if she dies I have a feeling you'll lose your stolen equipment anyway."

<p>Amalion looked closely at the image and saw that there was 8 men, "gah...8 men, I don't have time to get Argmen..."

<p>"Hurry sire, their intentions are defiantly not friendly"

<p>Amalion closed his eyes and nodded, "You're right...sometimes anger overpowers humanity".  With that he muttered a few odd phrases and began to concentrate, his whole body was tensed, the muscles on his thin frame were taunt like tight ropes.  Soon coils of electro-static sparks began to weave themselves around his body.  With a scream his flesh slowly turned into an essence of pure energy, quickly he flashed from the ground soared in Icibus' direction.

<p>****************************************************************************

<p>The leader laughed as she cautiously backed away, her dirks drawn, "do you really think you can defeat all of us?  I tell you, just come along with us, it's not you we're after anyway, we just want information.  We're not trying to...what the devil is that noise?  Men what's going on?"

<p>He looked toward his soldiers and they simply shrugged their shoulders.  "Sounds like thunder sir" one of them spoke, "but there's no...look!".  The solider pointed to the sky and his comrades looked up to see a huge bolt of energy coming toward them.  They moved back quickly as it struck the ground.  Soon the form began to transform back into the shape of Amalion, the tendrils of flowing multi-colored energy turned back into his unmarred skin.  There he stood, shaking a few sparks from his hair.

<p>"Oh yay...my hero" said the woman with infinite sarcasm.

<p>"Don't get so worked up, I'm just here to get my things back."  He watched as the men shook off their astonished looks and once more took an offensive position.

<p>"Yeah right...we'll argue about that later...you wanna get the 5 on the left, I'll get the 3 on the right?"

<p>Amalion babbled a few inaudible statements, "your gonna give me 5? why don't you take the 5 on the left?".

<p>Finally the leader had had enough, he slapped himself on the forehead, "the bickering married couple, what are you waiting for! get them!  Is it too much to ask?"

<p>Amalion, dug his feet into the ground and called behind him, "you ready lady? Lady? Hey you there?" he turned around but she was nowhere to be found.  "It figures..."

<p>The leader roared with laughter, "seems your friend has abandoned you.  Well we don't need her anyway, it's you we want."  Just as the men began circling around Amalion a crossbow bolt came rushing from the trees and struck one man in the leg, piercing his armor and sending him straight to the soil.

<p>"Look out!"  The leader called.  The men were spinning in circles trying to find out where the arrow came from.

<p>"That a girl!"  Amalion called out.  He quickly began preparing a spell, roaring threads of fire began to dance about his body and robes.  He slammed a fist into the ground and fire erupted from the earth several feet away, engulfing 2 men.  Quickly they rolled on the ground, scurrying to put themselves out.

<p>"Die Sylvan!" said another man, rushing toward Amalion, axe raised.  As soon as he hit, Amalion's entire body turned to sand and collapsed to the ground.  "What the..."  the soldier was in shock, he thought his eyes were playing tricks on him.  At that instant another arrow came from the forest and tore right through his weapon arm, forcing him to release his axe.  He clenched his arm in incredible pain and quickly ran into the forest.

<p>The leader gritted his teeth and snarled, "your lucky day Sylvan, you'll never be safe from now on...never.  Men, fall back!"  Quickly him and the few men left began making their way from the scene as quickly as possible.

<p>"Leaving so soon!" cried Amalion as his body reformed from the pile of sand, "I got one more present" he spoke softly to himself.  He clenched both fists together, soon webs of pure essence began to gather from his entire body into his hands.  "Energy..."  He finally split his hands quickly apart, releasing a massive ball of screaming energy "...Disruption!".  The energy soared through the forest toward the last direction of the men, tearing through everything in it's path.  Amalion seemed as if though in deep concentration, so deep it made him drop to one knee.  "Not far enough...not yet..."  he kept repeating, finally after a few more seconds of wincing in extreme concentration, he commanded the contained energy to disperse.  The explosion could be see even from where he was standing, it shot a ton of earth and rock into the air and cleared out a good portion of the area.

<p>Panting, he stood back up, "my brother would kill me for destroying that many trees."  He called out into the forest, "Ok lady, now we need to talk"
