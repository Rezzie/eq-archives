Thank you for the good idea about what to do when people give you money for being nice.  I've found that most often it is the same/higher levels (like Noiro, Sanguine, Cammeron, Felcrane on Rathe) who provide good roleplay, friendship, or something in return for healing or buffs.  I've always felt bad because I don't peddle my spells to make cash.<p>Along this same line, I know a marginally immature player who got spells later on (he's a paladin/ranger/shadowknight type) who then tried to sell minor castings for 5pp.  Then 5gp.  Then 5 sp.  (This was with shouts in the N Qeynos zone.)  Then he offered for free.  It was educational in the value people place on a bit of healing or food, etc. - it seems to be worth more when done from friendship or genuine kindness than avarice.<br>
