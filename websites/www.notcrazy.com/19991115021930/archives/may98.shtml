<i>Sony has designed a huge new PC RPG, designed to be enjoyed by communities of up to 100 players per server. EverQuest is quite a departure for Sony and is being developed by the newly formed 989 Studios.
The environment is the fully three-dimensional world of Norrath. This world spreads over five continents with 30 adventure zones and 12 major cities. Also, 1,000 players can interact, form alliances or battle each other across this vast virtual landscape.<Br><BR>

It's due to launch this October, with a number of features unseen in previous Rags of this kind. This includes the ability to view the action from multiple angles and the chance to lock yourself into or out of a kind of deathmatch mode called "Pkilling".<BR><BR>

It's certainly an ambitious effort, and while it looks great in the graphics department, online games of this skill have to be tested live and by large numbers of players.</i><BR><BR>

<I>Ultima Online Gold?<BR><BR>

<a href="ultima.scorched.com" target="_top">Ultima@Scorched</a> has posted another update. Chris Bailey talks about Ultima Online Gold, his chats with Richard Garriott and Ed Del Castillo, and a surprise at the EverQuest booth:<BR><BR>

...The literature states that the Gold Edition "captivates new users with it's simplified interface, expanded help code and complete documentation. For the current player, it offers uncharted territory, Lost Lands filled with dangerous new creatures, secret temples, and untold wealth. The Ultima Online Gold Edition also enhances it's robust community by providing vastly improved communication tools like text and voice chat. The game has been expanded to better support international players through in game localization and web site translations."<BR><BR>

...I did chat briefly with Richard Garriott regarding UO Gold. He stated that the main focus of the product is to improve accessibility and cater more to international users. This will be accomplished by more extensive help screens, a demo tutorial, and the establishment of foreign servers.<BR><BR>

I did get to talk to Ed DelCastillo at length today about many of the issues surrounding Ultima: Ascension. Ed is very passionate about his plans for the game, and has some specific goals in mind for the game's completion. Most of these involve maintaining the underlying elements of a traditional role playing game, but making them transparent or invisible to the person playing the game...<BR><BR>

The final surprise from today was stopping by Sony Interactive's area of the show and witnessing Richard Garriott playing Everquest under the guidance of the game's lead programmer.

<B>More E3 Coverage from Everquest Extreme</B><BR>
<I>A few of our contacts from E3 reported several things to us reguarding the demo at E3.<ul><li>The Erudite cities have just been brought online, and a ferry runs a regular cycle between there and Qeynos, with a short stop at an uncharted island. Takes approximately 30-45 minutes for each leg of the trip.<li>There will be RT(roundtime) for swinging swords and casting spells. This will be dependant on the weight of the weapon and your agility, the spell RT will probably be based on the level of the spell and its difficulty.<li>"the graphics are GREAT, better than screen shots show","they have mastered the 3d looks"<li>"The game is still FULL of cheats" - by this he means not actual cheats but the ability for brad to change lots of stuff from his console, much like the rcon command in quake and quake2<li>Brad could morph into any monster at any time, and even change its height and weight, for example he at one time was a 90ft cyclops, and also a 3ft cyclops<li>"The UI(user interface) is not compoletely intuitive yet, combat was simplistic, you click on a monster to "target" then hit a key to start "fighting" and it just scrolls results messages"<li>Race greatly effects what classes you can be, as well as how good you are at being that class.<li>You start off with only a few items, a magician for instance has a staff, shirt, pants, and 1 spell in his book.<li>Ogres cannot be monks.<li>Lighting, weather, and sky effects are great, but not completely functional yet.<li>"aradune was a beholder and a cyclops" (beholder was called "Evil Eye")<li>Naked elves appear to be wearing leotards (isnt that usefull info?)<li>The game is all around stable with very little lag to the point of almost non existance(take note only 19 people were on the server)<li>Combat and functionality need work.<li>"monster IQ is decent... upoin attacking one skeleton, 2 more came running to assist from off screen"<li>3 kinds of viewing modes:<ol><li>regular: stuff everywhere<li>full screen: everything... just used for screen caps<li>large: "full screen" which is a HUD kind of feel</ol><li>Brad wouldent release much info on magic and alignment, but the fireball spell needed to be scribed into a book then memorized before it could be used, quite a lengthy process.</ul>We will release more info as it is made available.<br> NOTE: none of the info is official and has not been released by Sony, who as rumor has it has changed its name to Studio 887 or somthing like that(somone email me the correct name)</i><BR>

<i>Absolutely stunning, that's the only way to describe EQ. With Brad McQuaid as my guide, I toured Norrath for the better part of 2 hours. The level of detail is simply amazing, the user interface is, for the most part, very slick. A few rough areas like a patch of water you can fall into in town and can't climb out, remind you that this is still a pre-beta. <BR>
A few new bits of info: <BR>
1) That dragon we saw was a young Lava Dragon, as in it's much smaller than the full-size version. <BR>
2) The Erudite cities have just been brought online, and a ferry runs a regular cycle between there and Qeynos, with a short stop at an uncharted island. Takes approximately 30-45 minutes for each leg of the trip. <BR>
3) Magic system is still top secret. Brad showed me a few of the spells we've already seen, but all details of the system are still under wraps. <BR>
4) Ogres can't be Monks, but can be Shadow Knights. <BR>
5) Darkness is dark Stock up on torches, guys. <BR>
Levelling or even leaving Qeynos right now is very difficult, as the game is in the very early stages of balancing. Basically, you can't outrun anything, so if you start taking the short end of the fight, you have to run for the guards and hope you live long enough to reach them. <BR>
All of the races and classes are present, but many are very limited because of the current state of development. <BR>
Overall, a very promising beginning. Brad made it clear that he wants this to be a place the "Hard Core" RPG'er can enjoy (but doesn't like the term, because it is synonymous with "Unprofitable" to some marketing types. EQ is looking very much like it will be able to deliver. <BR><BR></i>

<B>Brad McQuaid On DevBoard</B><BR>
For the past week or so, much discussion has been going on on the <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/boards/dev/index.shtml" target="_top">DevBoard</a> concerning the possibility of different types of dragons with different alliances. Here is what Brad McQuaid had to say about this:<BR><BR>

<i>It is our view that dragons are very exotic and rare creatures. Because of this, we are not going to list different types, nor their different attacks, alignments, colors, etc. Coming face to face with a dragon and doing combat with it (regardless of whether you live or die) will be something you can be really proud of. Many people who play EQ will never see a dragon -- they'll only hear tales and such. In fact, from a purely gamers standpoint, I wouldn't have wanted to even show screen shots with the lava dragon. It's even my hope that those who do encounter dragons in EQ will keep the details to themselves... in a MUD I used to play quite often the ultimate foe was Tiamat, and I remember asking people about the dragon... where it was, how did it fight, what treasure it guarded, and I received very few, and then always vague, answers to my questions. And then, well over a year later, when I finally was able to face the creature, the awe and honor was that much greater.<BR><BR>

<B>Site Overhaul</B><BR>
I made the Menubar on the side smaller and also redid the menu itself as promised earlier today (or yesterday for those of you who sleep). All the guild information have been consolidated into one link which, once the linked page is completed, will be a one stop source for NC Guild members. My first priority is adding the History section and then the race section. Followed by the Guild section. this way information that you need can be delievered to you.. information to the guild I can deliever via e-mail.<BR>

<B>An Insane Overhaul</B><BR>
I have had a few comments regarding the haphazard mix of news and guild related links on this page, so I am redoing the side menubar yet again. I will be consolidating all of the guild related links into one link, I will be adding more Everquest Information, and I will try to make the page more user friendly for people at and below 800x600 Resoloution.<BR>

<B>A Treatise on EQ vs. UO</B><BR><BR>
I was reading through the <a href="http://www.eqvault.net/boards/dev/index.shtml" target="_top">Dev Board</a> on <a href="http://www.eqvault.net" target="_top">EQ Vault</a> and ran across a posting titled <a href="eq.treatise.html">A Treatise on EQ vs. UO</a>... very good reading, and brings up some valid points. Also be sure to read the <a href="eq.treatise.followup.html">follow up message</a> to the posting also.<BR>

I have decided to not only make this a NoT CraZy Guild page, but I have also decided to make it a general news page for the games that NoT CraZy is involved in... Right now, I am focusing on Everquest, since the guild seems to have lost interest in Ultima Online. Once I have Official word from the rest of the guild that UO-NC is dead, I will be removing the UO section from the page.

Brad McQuaids' postings on EQ Devboard
<BR>
The gist of his postings basically states that the servers will be backed up often and they are sure they can keep the data safe and secure. <BR><BR>
The maintenance on the servers will be done by full time employees.<BR><BR>
Currently, to attack, you target the guy, turn on auto-attack. Then you make sure your in range and facing him. If that is done, you can now then move around and click on various combat-related skills.<BR><BR>
They will update the FAQ "post-E3(Electronic Entertainment Expo)" and its creation will be handled the same way as last time.
