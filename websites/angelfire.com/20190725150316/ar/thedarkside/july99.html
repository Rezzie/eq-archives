<br><font color="#C0C0C0">Greetings dark friends.&nbsp;
A few updates.&nbsp; I did some minor changes to some of the areas in the
<a href="../zoneidx.html">Zone Analysis</a> section as well as added maps
to most of those zones.&nbsp; I am still missing maps from Lavastorm and
Solusek A.&nbsp; If you have it, please send me an email.&nbsp; None of
those have been made by me.&nbsp; I simply gathered them from all over
the web with the consent of most of their authors.&nbsp; Thank you for
those that let me use it.&nbsp; I also made a few changes to the <a href="equip.html">Equipment
Guide</a>, adding more information to some items.&nbsp; Thank you for those
that sent me info on them.</font></font>

necros out there, you probably heard about this, but the Plane of Fear
has been modified since the last patch update.&nbsp; It is now extremely
hard even for characters level 50.&nbsp; Guess Verant thought people were
having too much fun getting new items there.</font>

quest does seem to be broken.&nbsp; I tried it myself and failed when trying
to combine items, either with or without the quill and parchment.&nbsp;
I was told that other people had the same problem so I would advise you
to wait a little before trying it.&nbsp;</font>

My host, Angelfire, gives me only 5mb of space and I am on that limit already.&nbsp;
Thus, I cannot upload any more big files without deleting something.&nbsp;
At least no more images, which is quite bad.&nbsp; I have already applied
for a new server, this time with my own domain.&nbsp; If everything goes
well, the new address for The Dark Side will be www.eqnecro.com.&nbsp;
In the email I received I was told that it would take one or two days to
process my application so I expect to be in the new address by Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

 When fighting in against more than just a single creature, your party should

different target, the battle will not only be harder, but also more deadly.&nbsp;

is now online (looks very nice)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Pottery has been
modified (no more easy money)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- You can report
a player who is harassing other players by typing /report. This will save
the last 10 lines of text</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- /time now reports
the Earth time as well as EQ time</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- If a character
is resurrected, a spell will be placed on that player for a short duration
once the resurrection is complete</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- /surname allows
players level 20+ to issue his/her last name (finally)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- If a character
is killed by someone with his or her PK flag ON (+pvp), they will return
from death with Zero Mana.&nbsp; This is to address the 'naked mage syndrome'</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- PvP Faction Hits
have been removed until we can implement an aggressor flag (IF Verant decides
to)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- If a character
is knocked unconscious and has no stamina, the player will still regain
consciousness</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Pets can no longer
open locked doors</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Players are no
longer able to cast Shadowstep next to a zone point and teleport to an
area past the teleport region, which is inaccessible to other characters</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- If a player is
too far from a corpse while attempting to perform the /loot command, a
message will now be given</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Players may now
target Drakes much easier</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Several&nbsp;
"Safe Zones" have been Fixed</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- A number of quests
have been both enhanced
and added</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- If a character
is blinded, the chat box will no longer flash</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- If a shuriken
or throwing knife is equipped, then unequipped, the weapon will no longer
remain on the character model</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Necromancer research
components that did not previously stack should now stack (almost a great
fix...)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- The Bug that allowed
Screaming Terror to work Outdoors has been fixed (BUG?)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Vampiric Curse
damage has been upped</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- Hitting F1 twice,
or /pet target will now target your pet (it actually does)</font>
<br><font color="#C0C0C0">- A Quest to help
casters with research has been added.&nbsp; Good aligned races should check
North Karana, while those with a more malign disposition should check South
Ro</font></font>

not feel that necromancers gained much with this new patch.&nbsp; They
were either minor changes or fixes to earlier patches.&nbsp; There are
some good things though.&nbsp; The new quest to help casters with research
might prove useful.&nbsp; To take it, go to South Ro (loc +100 +500) and
talk to a vendor inside a tent named Smith Tu'ysa. You should give her
lightstones and greater lightstones in order to get the 3 different components
for the quest.&nbsp; A lightstone will give you either one of the research
books that contains recipes required for the quest.&nbsp; A Greater Lightstone
will give you a Concordance of Research, a container piece used in the
quest.&nbsp; To complete the quest, you will have to create runes with
items such as weapons and gems.&nbsp; Once I get more info on this I will
post an update.</font>

is the Plane of Fear.&nbsp; I believe high level players were missing an
area entirely devoted to them.&nbsp; Well, here it is.&nbsp; Click <a href="../fear.html">here</a>

some terrible things.&nbsp; Gather Shadows still doesn't blink before fading.&nbsp;
Screaming Terror has been officially renamed Summon Train (I don't know
a situation when terror will be useful inside a dungeon).&nbsp; And the
worst thing is the Words problem.&nbsp; They made our Words stackable now,
which is great.&nbsp; But the problem is the new patch simply disappeared
with Words people already had.&nbsp; I am included in that category and
lost over 20 Words I needed.&nbsp; I hope they can fix this, but so far

One version sells for 3g and the other 7g.&nbsp; To research Intensify
Death, you must use the more expensive versions, the ones that sell for
about 7g at vendors.&nbsp; I have not yet tried to research it again, but

 So, when exactly does your pet get experience?&nbsp; Well, pretty much
always.&nbsp; I asked this question to about 5 different GMs already and
the answer has always been the same.&nbsp; Your pet shares experience with
you anytime it does any amount of damage to a creature of makes the kill.&nbsp;
Thus, anytime your pet is involved in the battle at any point he will get
experience.&nbsp; Telling him to back off will not help...</font></font></td>

<br><font color="#C0C0C0">Anyway, just wanted
to confirm that Screaming Terror is indeed both Fear and Forget in the
same spell.&nbsp; Two saves are applied when casting it.&nbsp; The creature
might resist both, or be Feared and come back to attack you, or be Feared
and come back but with its hate list cleared out.&nbsp; It is quite nice
when the later works and it does not matter how much damage you had dealt
to it.&nbsp; If it does have any DoT's on it, it will always come back

if Screaming Terror is actually supposed to replace Charm as mentioned
in the patch update.&nbsp; The Charm spell still says usable by necros,
but only at level 61.&nbsp; That may mean they are still working on it.&nbsp;
As for Intensify Death, the Words you need are indeed Sentient, Absorption
and Recluse.&nbsp; I tried to research it twice and failed both times.&nbsp;
My Words still combine to nothing... I heard you there are two versions
of Words of Sentient, one that is stackable and one that is not.&nbsp;
I have not yet seen stackable Words of Sentient, but that sounds quite
strange.&nbsp; I asked a GM tonight and was told that Intensify Death is
indeed still broken.&nbsp; It cannot be researched no matter what you do.&nbsp;
So don't even try it.</font>

My idea is to have a screenshot of the item, a brief description about

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">By now you have probably
downloaded the new patch and tried it out.&nbsp; Hopefully you liked it
better than me, as I was quite disappointed at it.&nbsp; First, Gather
Shadows does not blink before fading as promised.&nbsp; It can still fade
right after casting and without warning.&nbsp; Second, hitting F1 twice
does not target my pet like it was supposed to.&nbsp; Third, the research
for Intensify Death is still broken or it seems so.&nbsp; I read the Diablerie
book and the Words to research it have been changed.&nbsp; It now supposedly
requires Sentient, Absorption, and Recluse (yep, Recluse instead of Refuge).&nbsp;
Now, I do not know if this is right or not since I did try combining those
3 Words and got the "<i>Those items did not combine to anything</i>" message.&nbsp;
There went my precious Words...&nbsp; Fourth, I have not seen any new high
level spells in the vendors I visited.&nbsp; I have been to Freeport and
Neriak.&nbsp; I did find the Screaming Terror spell in Neriak on a vendor
called Olak N'Mar.&nbsp; I tried it out quite a few times and am still
not sure what it does.&nbsp; When casting on creatures that con'd green,
I would fear it and it just would not come back.&nbsp; I did it about ten
times and I do not know if it was plain luck that it did not come back
(maybe someone else got it when I sent it).&nbsp; But when I tried it on
creatures that con'd blue, it would not only always came back but the spell
was resisted quite a few times.&nbsp; Thus, it seemed like a normal fear.&nbsp;
More testing is required but I would conclude that Screaming Terror is
both Fear and Forget combined.&nbsp; Two saves are applied though as the
creature might either resist the Fear effect, the Forget effect or even
both.&nbsp; I will post an update on Screaming Terror once I do more testing.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Two other updates.&nbsp;

island with a few Alluring Sirens.&nbsp; You can see it from the boat when

<a href="mailto:aaron.stauss@COMPAQ.com?subject=Ocean of Tears">Neekorpolis</a>.&nbsp;
And finally, when I posted the analysis for South Karanas I never really
mentioned one of the best things of this zone.&nbsp; There is a spot in
SK where two Treants spawn.&nbsp; Killing them will give you amazing XP
and loot in such a manner that I have not seen before.&nbsp; This is supposedly
a well kept secret, so make sure you check out the analysis to South Karana
if you are heading into your mid 20s and if looking for a place to hunt.&nbsp;

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Now for an interesting
comment.&nbsp; You have probably taken the Titanic, the boat that takes
you from Freeport to Butcherblock Mountains.&nbsp; In doing so, you have
gone by the Ocean of Tears, where the boat stops a few times.&nbsp; If
you are like me, you have probably wondered what could you find in this
immense zone besides the Cyclops you can see every now and then from the
boat.&nbsp; Well, I met someone the other day that said he could gain at
least one bubble of experience every hour there.&nbsp; The zone is always
empty and there is plenty to kill.&nbsp; You supposedly have to be in your
early to later 10s to hunt there, and with a group of friends.&nbsp; Now
the mystery is where and what exactly do they hunt.&nbsp; That I am not
sure but will try to find out.&nbsp; All I know is he went from level 13
to 19 in a few days and made quite a lot of money.&nbsp; Well, just thought
you would like to know this as hunting in crowded zones can be quite boring.&nbsp;
If you have any information on this, please send me an <a href="mailto:skinner.tds@angelfire.com?subject=Ocean of Tears">email</a>.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">I have added a little
more information to some spells in the Spell List as well as the level
29 spells.&nbsp; I also added the initial analysis to the Solusek A dungeon.&nbsp;
I have not yet fully explored it or reached Solusek B, so if you have paid
Solusek a visit, make sure you send me an <a href="mailto:skinner.tds@angelfire.com?subject=Solusek Analysis">email</a>.&nbsp;
Solusek is quite a fun place but is also one of the most deadly dungeons
in Norrath.&nbsp; Make sure you read the Solusek analysis before you pay
it a visit.</font>

 One of the most boring but easiest ways to learn a language is to find
a friend who knows at least the basics of the language you want to learn.&nbsp;
You may also spend one practice point to learn the basics of it.&nbsp;
Then, form a group with a friend and teach him that language or have him
teach you.&nbsp; The one who is learning will learn the basics and a little
more (one more point).&nbsp; You should now both zone and whoever learned
teaches the other.&nbsp; He will increase his skill by two points.&nbsp;
Zone and keep repeating the above until you are both excellent in that
language.</font></font></td>

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">Just to make sure
you all know, Charm, Hungry Earth, and Intensify Death are among our bugged
spells.&nbsp; Hungry Earth can be researched since the last patch by using
Words of Materials and Words of Spirit but it can't be added to the spellbook.&nbsp;
It replies that you already have that spell on your spellbook.&nbsp; I
would guess that even though you get the Charm spell, it recognizes it
as Shadow Vortex, the spell that used to research with Words of Materials
and Spirit.&nbsp; As for Charm, even though you might get it, it has been
removed from the game and if you do have one, it will say you need to be
level 61 to use.&nbsp; Finally, Intensify Death is not researchable.&nbsp;
If you try combining the Words to make it you will always fail.&nbsp; You
won't lack the skills but it will simply tell you that those Words do not
combine to anything.&nbsp; Furthermore, I heard a rumor that the Words
to research Intensify Death have been changed.&nbsp; I will post an update
on this as soon as I find out the truth or the new patch is available.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">I received quite
a few emails from people asking about hunting strategies.&nbsp; Thus, I
thought it would be interesting to have a page describing a few of the

<p><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Arial Narrow" size="2">I made a few small
changes to the Spell List section.&nbsp; I changed the rating of 2 spells,
Mend Bones and Rest the Dead among them.&nbsp; The analysis you find in
that section are based on my experiences with those spells.&nbsp; I believe
I have been a little too harsh on their usefulness and after more fruitful
experiences with those 2 spells in particular and a nice discussion with
a fellow necromancer I decided to change the their ratings.</font>

I am looking for contributions to this web site.&nbsp; If you know of any

 So you are looking for that level 29 pet?&nbsp; Well, you can either research
it or buy it in the Ocean of Tears.&nbsp; Take the boat in Freeport and
get off on the first stop.&nbsp; At the docks, jump on the water and swim
to your left until you reach an island where you can see a tower.&nbsp;
At the top of that tower you will find an elf that sells the pet spell.&nbsp;
I know he KOS necros, but I am not sure if all necros.&nbsp; The safest
way to buy the spell is to either ask a friend to buy it for you or create
a new character in Freeport, give him some money, and send him to the Ocean
of Tears.</font></font></td>

I have added the level 24 spells to the <a href="spells.html">Spell List</a>

information about the deepest part of the dungeon, including a brief guide
on how to hunt the three NPCs located there.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="zoneidx.html">Zone
Analysis</a> section.&nbsp; Last but not least, as I had mentioned before,
Hungry Earth could be researched by combining Words of Materials and Words
of Spirit.&nbsp; The Diablerie books show that as the Word of Shadow spell.&nbsp;
After the new patch, combining these Words will create Hungry Earth.&nbsp;
I attempted and was successful at researching it so I can confirm it is
true.&nbsp; The problem is you cannot add it to your spellbook as it will
say you already have it in there.&nbsp; I petitioned a GM and he told me
the spell is still broken and they are currently working on a fix.&nbsp;
He said it should be working after the next patch.&nbsp; Well, I sure hope
so since this spell has been broken for quite some time.</font></font>

A fellow necromancer said he combined those two before the latest patch

his Umbrals Messenger became Hungry Earth!&nbsp; I do not know if it will
work, but it seems like it should.&nbsp; I remember doing the same thing
some time ago and getting the same Umbrals Messenger.&nbsp; I got rid of
the spell though as I didn't know what it was and could not add it to my

 Once you reach level 16, you will be able to start researching a few spells.&nbsp;
Research is necessary for some mid and high level spells.&nbsp; To research
a spell, you need the Book of Dark Bindings (found at most necromancer
guilds, with the exception of Erudin's - thank you Saboth) and the Words
necessary for that spell (found on creatures).&nbsp; For example, the research
only level 20 spell Harmshield requires Words of Absorption and Words of
Refuge.&nbsp; Put those two words on your Book of Dark Bindings and hit
combine.&nbsp; Hopefully you won't fail...&nbsp; I would strongly recommend
spending as many points as you can on research to reduce chances of failure.&nbsp;
Spell recipes can be found here or in the Diablerie books (also found at
necromancer guilds).&nbsp; To read the Diablerie books you must know the
language it is written on, such as Old Erudin for Diablerie 1.</font></font></td>
