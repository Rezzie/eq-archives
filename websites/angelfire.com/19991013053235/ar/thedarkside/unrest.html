<td><font color="#C0C0C0">The Estate of Unrest is the manor located next
to Dragnor's Cauldron and near the town of Kaladim.&nbsp; You can either
get to it from Kaladim or if coming from the Antonica continent, take the
boat in Freeport and wait until you reach Butcherblock Mountains.&nbsp;
Be aware that guards patrol the docks and will kill you on sight.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Unrest is a popular place indeed.&nbsp; The area
is always crowded and you might encounter lag problems every now and then.&nbsp;
But the amount of people here shouldn't diminish your experience as the
Estate of Unrest houses a very large quantity of undead creatures.&nbsp;
Unrest can be a fun and rewarding experience, but it can also be a deadly
one.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Unrest can be divided into 3 parts.&nbsp; At the
front of the house you can find the weakest creatures in Unrest such as
Greater Skeletons, Jack'O'Lanterns, and Tormented Deads.&nbsp; You should
hunt here if you are in the upper teens (level 16+).&nbsp; The best way
to do it is pull one undead near the walls and close to the tunnel that
leads to Dragnor's Cauldron.&nbsp; Make sure you get one at a time and
be careful with the Death Beetles that wander all over Unrest.&nbsp; They
will attack you if you are fighting an undead creature.&nbsp; At this stage,
you can do most of your hunting solo but getting a partner might help wipe
out the always nasty Death Beetles.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Once you hit level 20+ you can start hunting creatures
that dwell inside the Estate of Unrest.&nbsp; You will not be able to solo
anymore as the creatures are not only tougher but also have a tendency
to come in more than one.&nbsp; I would definitely stay outside the manor
as camping inside it will most certainly lead to death.&nbsp; Set your
party right next to the outer walls of Unrest and have a tank pull from
the first floor of the manor.&nbsp; The creatures you can expect to battle
are Ghouls, Darkbone Skeletons, Drybone Skeletons, Carrion Ghouls, and
Skeleton Monks.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb, the deeper you go into the first
floor, the harder the creatures will be.&nbsp; One tip I would give you
is to know exactly what you will be doing once battle starts.&nbsp; As
the outer walls of Unrest are heavily populated with players, it can be
difficult to fully understand what is going on.&nbsp; Thus, the use of
the /assist command can come in handy.&nbsp; You should at least tell your
party to take out the tougher creature first and then kill whatever came
with the pull.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">After level 24, you can start heading inside the
house for good.&nbsp; No more pulling to outer walls.&nbsp; There are plenty
of things you can do inside the Estate of Unrest.&nbsp; The largest number
of creatures your party should be looking for can be found in the basement.&nbsp;
Getting to the basement can be tricky as the passage is somewhat hidden.&nbsp;
The last door at the left hallway from front of the house has a bookshelf.&nbsp;
If you click on it, it will open up the passage downstairs.&nbsp; At the
basement you can find the toughest skeleton variations from Unrest (barbed
and monks), and the unique and toughest creatures from this zone, the Werebats
and the Festering Hags.&nbsp; Both the Werebat and the Hag are around level
29 and can hit very, very hard and really fast.&nbsp; At mid to upper 20s,
you will last very little if no one comes to your aid.&nbsp; The experience
and loot they provide is very rewarding though and worth the risk.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">One of the most interesting things about Unrest
is the change it will be for a necromancer used to casting DoT spells and
drain life.&nbsp; To hunt in Unrest you will almost always have to be in
a large size party, which means will often be killed very fast.&nbsp; Casting
DoT spells is not a good strategy as it will not be very effective.&nbsp;
Heart Flutter would be good anyway not for its DoT effects, but for its
weakening effect.&nbsp; But it has always been resisted when I cast, even
on creatures that con'd green.&nbsp; Thus you will have to turn to direct
damage and drain life spells to make yourself useful.&nbsp; But the most
interesting thing is that you should be able to hunt without your pet in
Unrest, and you actually should at certain times.&nbsp; In a party with
at least 1 tank, the creature should not turn upon you.&nbsp; And since
most creatures in Unrest are undead creatures, you can use Dominate Undead.&nbsp;
Whenever your tank pulls more than one tough creature, charm one of them
and use it to kill the second one.&nbsp; Of course, your newly acquired
pet will turn upon you at some point but by then your party should be able
to handle it.&nbsp; And who wouldn't think having a Skeleton Monk as a
pet is cool?</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Unrest is a great place to hunt as it is populated
by tons of undead creatures.&nbsp; And as masters of the undead, we necromancers
can only benefit from that.&nbsp; You can often find very good loot in
Unrest but XP is not that great.&nbsp; As you will be hunting in large
parties, whatever you kill will be shared with your team members and XP
goes up very slow.&nbsp; Nevertheless, critters spawn very fast and the
action is non-stop.&nbsp; A very fun place indeed if you don't happen to
meet a Hag face to face...</font></td>

you ever see someone shouting HAG and coming your way, zone as fast as
you can or things can get complicated.&nbsp; Another thing you should know
is that research components appear to be fairly common in Unrest.&nbsp;
Also, the warbone chips you can find here can be used to cast a better
pet than normal bone chips.&nbsp; And finally, make sure you have a tank
in your party, and more importantly, a good one.&nbsp; If you find yourself
in a team with a tank that keeps pulling the entire undead community of
Unrest, disband as fast as you can and start looking for another party.</font>
