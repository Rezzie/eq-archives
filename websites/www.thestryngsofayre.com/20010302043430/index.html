<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Stryngs of Ayre is a multi server. It is not an exclusive
Bard-only Guild as the name might imply, although it seems that the majority of players
that we attract to it are Bards. Due to the way that this game works, and the player's
desires to make sure they can meet their friends a little sooner and easier, the Charter
reflects the needs of most Guilds and associations in this game. While I would,
personally, love to see an &quot;artist oriented Guild&quot;, the reality is that this is
impossible in the game of EverQuest without support from Verant. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In these pages, The Stryngs of Ayre, with all its chapters will try
to make its announcements and let everyone see, and meet the majority of their members.
These pages will function as the link between all chapters. These pages are in constant
flux and change, as are all the Guild chapters, and will be updated as much as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A very special thanks is to be given to Cryshandilynn/Mohanna, who
has invested a massive amount of time in helping to create these Guilds in various
servers, when many of them take hours to get a response from a GM. It was her that got the
Charter passed through with help from a Guild on her server, which made the rest possible.</p>

<p>Thx, Moshkiae Soulwriter</p>
