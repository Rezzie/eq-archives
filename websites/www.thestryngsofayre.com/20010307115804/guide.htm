<p align="left"><em><u><strong>Disclaimer:<br>
</strong></u></em>Most Bard Guides, in various websites, are geared towards information
that is, probably, not applicable anymore as Verant, has grown, and its game has changed.
With those changes, came many things that are expected and many things that are not
expected. Without sounding paranoid, the original statistics that this game started with
(as suggestions) for any Bard are now inferior and not exactly up to par to the changes
and direction that the game has taken. </p>

<p align="left">This Bard Guide is based on my observations taken from having played over
a dozen Bards in as many servers, and taking them to a level that tends to indicate that
the numbers that were suggested originally, are no longer efficient, or helpfull.&nbsp;One
major example, is STRENGTH. The game, at higher levels, when the Bard is not counted on
for much except to play one song, used to be the one statistic that everyone went for,
(after all this is a game where you have to fight), but today, the game's designers are
changing how things work, and I think that the days that Guilds will have nothing but
tanks taking down the Gods, will be coming to a crawling end. This will be a very
important moment for all the other classes in the game, that supposedly can not do any
damage, or provide any defense. The Bard, will then, be able to do much more than simply
be a mana battery, and we can only hope that Verant is willing to take the game into this
direction, so everyone's secondary accounts, won't be a tank, but a different class.</p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><u>Statistics and the definitions: In relationship to a Bard.<br>
</u></strong></em>This game is too smart, to have a starting set of statistics, to make
use of two of them, and <u>ignore</u> the other five. It is said that some only need
Intelligence, and that others only need Wisdom. And then others need Strength. The one
thing to remember, is that the Bard is usually considered a &quot;jack of all trades and
master of none&quot;. If this is so, then, a Bard's set of statistics at the creation of
the character are most important ... unless you know the role you want to play, you must,
realize that this definition suggests that all statistics will play a role in the playing
of the game, sooner or later, and then some. The question is how.</p>

<p align="left">Strength<br>
How much you can carry<br>
Determines average damage<br>
How fast you learn Offensive skills</p>

<p align="left">Stamina<br>
How many hit points you receive <br>
How long you can hold your breath under water<br>
Ratings that involve a &quot;length&quot; of time</p>

<p align="left">Agility<br>
How quickly you learn/earn defensive statistics<br>
How difficult it is to hit you<br>
How much damage you will take</p>

<p align="left">Dexterity<br>
How quickly a Bard learns weapon skills<br>
How often weapons and other items will proc<br>
How quickly you learn the external skills</p>

<p align="left">Wisdom<br>
Amount of mana that priest classes have<br>
How quickly you learn skills if higher than Intelligence<br>
Apparently has no effect on Bard's whatsoever</p>

<p align="left">Intelligence<br>
How quickly you learn most skills<br>
Determines the amount of mana for Bards and Mages</p>

<p align="left">Charisma<br>
How will vendors and NPC's react to you in exchanges<br>
Affects the success of several Bard songs</p>

<p align="left"><br>
When looking at these base definitions, the choices that one would like to place the
starting points onto would normally lead you to Strength, Dexterity and Charisma. The only
problem is that if you place your points in Strength and Dexterity, it is safe to say that
you will, in all likelihood, be a Bard that wants to mix it up with weapons, and fight
some. And your aim through out the playing of the Bard should be to make sure that you can
get equipment that adds to that equation ... so you go for the AC in everything, and hope
that you can be twinked fast enough so you can be strong and play like some sort of a tank
... right! If you do this, in the later levels you will be the main user of the Cleric's
mana that you are trying to help your group with!</p>

<p align="left">But, if you have seen other Bards playing, you will notice that they can
use some instruments for some very different types of work and play. This is called the
&quot;Magical Bard&quot;, and it is the rarest form of Bard playing that you will find. It
is, at the same time, the most frustrating and difficult to learn, as it is to play it.
The needs for this type of Bard, are Charisma, Agility and Stamina. Charisma, because
there are several Bard songs that use it, and are the basis of the &quot;Magical
Bard&quot;. Agility, so you can hope not to take as much punishment as you are going to
otherwise take. Stamina, is a bit of the odd one here, but the extra points here would
help, just so that the times you have a weapon in hand, you do not stink up the
neighborhood (hear me Wood Elves). This also factors in the equation that adds up your hit
points total.</p>

<p align="left">Or, you may want to be the &quot;hybrid&quot; Bard. Meaning that you
average out all statistics, to make sure there are no serious imbalances. There are
serious debates as to the real value of Intelligence and Wisdom in a Bard's life, but it
is no secret that these appear in several items and instruments and that it should be
inconceivable that they do not affect things in one way or another. But, knowing the
strength that programmers have, and the clever way this game is designed, it should be a
rather interesting test to find a Bard with all Wisdom and Intelligence ... more on this
later.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><u>Decision time<br>
</u></strong></em>What kind of Bard do you think you can be? You do not start the
&quot;Magical&quot; Bard stuff until level 8, when you really get the first instrument
that allows you to play with it, and be effective, and this is the String skill with the
Lute or any other stringed instrument. Or do you want to just hit and hit and hit ...
because of you do, the Bard is not your style. The song add-on to the fighting is nice,
but hardly anything like a Paladin, or a Ranger, or a Shadow Knight, the so called
hybrids. Your damage output, with weapons on, will be somewhere near 60% of the damage
these can do. If you are thinking that the use of instruments is better than weapons, then
the Bard is for you. If not, please stick to a fighting class, because the Bard's
&quot;ok&quot; melee skills are not enough to make a difference in battle. Their
instruments, however, ARE enough to make a difference in ANY battle. A difference and MEAN
IT! Or as I say, &quot;with an exclamation point!&quot;</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><u>The classes and the statistics<br>
</u></strong></em>There are three classes that have Bards. They are Human, Half-Elf and
Wood-Elf. All of them have their advantages and disadvantages. The question is, what is
best for you, and what are you adept at?</p>

<p align="left">Human<br>
Starting statistics for a Human tend to lean towards the Strength side of things. At the
expense of Charisma. This class figures to make a good fighter if mixing it up is what you
want to do. I call this a &quot;front end stats bard&quot;.</p>

<p align="left">Half-Elf<br>
Has statistics that lean towards the average. Meaning that this particular one should be
able to fight as well as do the other magical stuff, if properly attired and designed.</p>

<p align="left">Wood-Elf<br>
Statistics are centered in the &quot;back end&quot; in that this is the weakest of the
Bards in terms of fighting skills, but it is also the best suited to magical stuff. It
comes with higher Charisma and Dexterity/Agility than the others, and these can play a
major role in your growth.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left"><em><strong><u>Where should the bonus points go?<br>
</u></strong></em>This is the subject of much discussion, and a part that is in constant
flux in this game. And we must remember that.</p>

<p align="left">At one time, it was nothing but a hack and slash game (it still is!), but
these days, more care is being taken so that a critter will require more of one thing or
another, rather than the hack and slash attitude of yesterday. The days that a major Guild
runs into a place, brings its Wellingtonian strategy to bear, and then walks in for the
big prize, are quite numbered. It's a matter of time. If so, adjusting your statistics to
fit the new, on-coming styles, is probably a very important thing to do. The only thing
that we know, is that the game will not return to what it was once before, and the
programmers are not interested in copying themselves much ... so improvements and change
are the most important thing to think about. And you have to remember that unlike all the
other classes in this game, this is one thing that the Bard in this game is capable of
doing, although I think that a Human Bard may have a harder time adapting for a Magickal
style, or that a Wood Elf Bard would have a harder time fighting ... specially in the
newer lands of Vellious. </p>

<p align="left">If the Bard, is the very first character that you will come up with, then
it is important that you have, in the least, an idea for what you would like to do with
your character ... weapons or instruments? ... </p>

<p align="left">If you choose weapons, then you need to center your points around the
statistics that help the hitting that you are going to do. These should be the Strength,
Stamina and Dexterity. Dexterity helps the weapons &quot;proc&quot; in the higher levels,
so one will need to help that area as much as possible. It also helps you learn your
hitting skills a wee bit faster. Strength always helps. Basically, one never has enough of
it. Stamina is also an issue, since you will miss a lot, and that affects the total
outcome of any fight. Most Bards just don't like to see all those misses while fighting,
but, this is a way of life. You have to remember that with the best weapons that you can
carry, you never will reach even 60% of all the damage a Paladin, or Ranger can do with
them. Your song add'ons, will give you 10/20% of that total, but all in all, you will
still always be in the lower scale when it comes to total damage ... and this is important
to remember if you want a Bard to be involved in Duels all the time. Personally, I
recommend a lot of Stamina, since you can raise the Strength easily enough via items, and
the rest divided between Dexterity and Strength.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">But the choice of &quot;offensive&quot;&nbsp; in terms of weapons, is not
necessarily a good idea, in this present evolution of this game. When you do a lot of
damage, critters like to pick on you, and with your song added, you could become the life
... the death of the party starting with you. Thus, you will need to always make sure that
your AC is high, and you have decent equipment to be able to last out in various fights.
Hopefully, the Guild you join will be strong enough to help you get your items, or at
least collect some money and free loot to buy them with.&nbsp; As an example, at level 30,
I once saw a level 33 Bard that had all the Lambent stuff and the great weapons ... and in
the end, this Bard was draining the group of more mana for healing (It was playing the
Bard's Mana song) than any other player. This clearly is an indication of points in
Strength, and nothing else to back it up. If you are gonna be strong, make sure that you
STAY strong, and Stamina is a part of this equation. If you are going to do damage, make
sure that you can do enough damage to help the criters die BEFORE you do. </p>

<p align="left">Thus, an &quot;average&quot; stat distribution would be something like
this. In a Half Elf Bard I like to have the Stamina higher than Strength and Agility
higher than Dexterity. With this combination, you will get the Defensive numbers rising up
at a reasonable pace. A Wood Elf Bard tends to have nice numbers for Agility and
Dexterity, but bad ones in Stamina and Strength, and you will probably shore those up. On
a Human, you probably should add some to Stamina, to bring it in line with the Strength,
Agility to bring it in line with the Dexterity, and the rest in Charisma, as this one has
the smallest amount of it.</p>

<p align="left">So far, Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity and Charisma are the main
Statistics that show up. What about Intelligence?</p>

<p align="left">Well, this is the one Statistic that most folks like to tell you that you
don't need. Basically it dictates the pace that you can learn all the other skills that
you have in the game, except one ... Alcohol Tolerance, since the basis on this one is the
opposite ... the bottom end of the Intelligence scale. And it is great fun, but not
something that many players enjoy, since the visual nature of it can get you into a dizzy
quickly and ... we don't need to discuss that. BUT, it is hilarious and a lot of fun!</p>

<p align="left">Intelligence is one Statistic that I have been studying real carefully. In
one of my Bards, I purposedly exagerated this number, and the results are that almost all
Statistics develop significantly faster than otherwise. By taking that &quot;ratio&quot;
and comparing it to my main Bard at level 30, I became inclined to think that the extra
points in Intelligence WILL NEVER hurt you. In fact, at level thirty, which takes about 10
hours to play through in a reasonable group, my weird algebraic comparisons seem to
indicate that a 10% increase in Intelligence at the start of the game, is almost equal to
half a bubble (10%) of experience n the whole level. What does this mean? To me, it means
that you can learn most your skills FASTER, and there fore you are more efficient, with
less misses all around in songs, and anything that you do. A lot of the RESIST factors in
a song, or spell, are based on your abilities, and if it is top'd, then it usually only
fails 5% of the time. If it is not top'd, the difference to the top gets added to this
number, and the scale for Critters resisting things of a magical nature tends to double up
in this area, meaning that with a skill level lower, you will not be as efficient as you
would with a higher skill level factor.</p>

<p align="left">Solutions vary, but I am not sure that any of us know the answer. I carry
on my main Bard, several Intelligence items, which I put on so that I can practice various
skills at certain times -- and these items are expensive, let me tell you! But I am not
sure that the &quot;occasional&quot; rate of my working on these skills, is as efficient
as they would be if these 5/10 points were placed in Intelligence at the start ... I have
not had the guts to create an Intelligence and Charisma Wood Elf Bard as yet -- notice
that the other two would not be suited for one of these tests, since we are trying to
maximize things to see what the reactions are on the growth of all these skills ... but I
do know that in the couple of Bards I have added Intelligence to, that skills take off on
level 1 and not on Level 3, and this has been an important factor, and I think one that
merits more discussion and evaluation.</p>

<p align="left">But there is one problem ... All these skills top off at Level 40. Then
you go to Level 50, and a new set of skills arrive, and additions to these skills are now
added. In other words, at Level 41, your hitting skills will not gain anymore after they
are top'd, until you reach Level 50, when a new scale defines your skill raising. The
other problem is that with each &quot;hell level&quot; these skill improvements take
longer by a factor of 10 to 20%. Used to be that at 25 you could max out the hitting
skills in the first bubble. At level 40, you will be lucky to get these top'd before the
3rd or 4th bubble, and here I think that the use of those few points in Intelligence are
very important, and helpfull. When you need the skills the most, you are missing a lot in
your fights, and I think that it should be a priority for any Bard, to work on top'ing off
their skills ASAP, and&nbsp; as efficiently as possible. Since a Bard can not load much of
anything to the secondary slots (Range) and there are no Range items that have
Intelligence statistics in this game (makes sure that Casters do not stack up mana), then
you have to settle for something like the McVaxious Horn on your hands to help. And while
a nice boost, this is not enough ... at level 38, I have a heck of a time getting my
Swimming skill past 170, just to give you an example. </p>

<p align="left">Comparatively speaking, I believe that we lose efficiency in a lot of the
fighting we do as we rise up in levels. What hides a lot of this at higher levels, is that
you get buff'd nicely by an Enchanter, or Shaman, in a big dance, and the end result is
that things happen so fast that it is impossible to tell anymore if you are efficient or
not on your hitting. The only way to tell, is for you to duel someone with the weapon, and
&quot;nekkid&quot;, so you can parse out the damages and the misses, and the improvements
in your skills, if any. But at 25, your skills flew by in the first bubble and your
hitting efficiency was better (UNBUFFED) comparatively speaking, than it is at level 35 on
the 1st bubble, as the skills are not top'd out. I only wish that I could come up with a
log of all the damage I did, and when the skill moved, so I could chart this out. I
believe that the skill raising thing at higher levels is slowed down intentionally to
cover for the massive Weapons and Items that were coming out of Kunark, the power of which
was causing the game to lose control over its &quot;equality&quot; and
&quot;balance&quot;. Making these skills not be efficient, helps the Power equipment be a
little less efficient .. still more than what you had before, but probably not as much as
one thinks. Once again, it is important to realize that at higher levels the buffing that
you get is incrredibly good, and it works too well in disguising the real skill level that
you are at. However, as I said before, with the same weapons for the last 15 levels, I can
tell you that my efficiency has dropped dramatically, and that it appears to be on par
with the skill level that I have for it. I have kept track of all my skills since level 25
or so, and the Excel Spreadsheet (thanks Rokk'y) is fantastic for it ... and you can see
things move, or not move. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">So here are a few suggestions, for each type of Bard, and a little blurb
on what this Bard MIGHT be most usefull at in later levels ... which is the key. Do
remember that I am doing this from the perspective of Level 38, and from what I have seen
in the skill sheets for some 20 Bards in this game (same name except one mispelling). I
imagine, and expect, that these skills continue on the basis that they have shown in those
charts, with a few usual modifications here and there, but all in all the curves tend to
go in one direction only.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>To make a fighting Wood Elf:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15 in Strength and 10 in Stamina. <br>
</strong>In this suggestion, you would be making a Bard that has a little Strength and is
capable of backing it up, with some Stamina. Generally, what will happen is that the
Stamina bar will drop seriously and the weapons will begin missing a lot in any prolonged
fight. For a Bard this may not be so bad, when they can add the Song #3, but generally,
the idea behind a fight, for this Bard, would be not to stink up the neighborhood with
their fighting. Light weapons are recommended and the faster they are the better. The 75
Stamina will be short and then some, when it comes to Dual Wield, and one might consider
one Necklace to help support that. Do remember that Strength items are easy to get in this
game, and later on you get so much Haste material that it almost makes these numbers
redundant.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>To make an instrument wielding Wood Elf:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 in Agility, 10 in Intelligence
and 10 in Charisma.<br>
</strong>This should get a few folks ticked off. Two things are needed to be able to hold
the instruments, and play them in the Rathe Mountains, and beyond, and use the likes of
Song #27 (Charm). One, is the ability to take a little punishment, which should only
happen when the songs miss (often!), and when one is tied up in situations where Lag (both
Server and Internet Latency) comes into play. Often you won't see the first or second hit
until you notice the bar has dropped one bubble. Agility, is a bit of a Defensive thing,
and dictates the amount you get punished for. Were it not that you have to maximize the
amount of time that the Charisma songs last, I would say that the higher this number is,
the more efficient things would be. A Bard with very high Agility is tough to bring down,
as would be a Ranger if they placed points there. Charisma is needed to help, and you have
to cover the 130 spot and 140 or so. With two Bracers, a Mask and 2 Rings, you will be at
134 and that will get things going. You can also get 2 Earrings and make it 144 or so.
This will carry you very well in the Rathe Mountains. Charisma items are not that hard,
they are out there, and 6 of these are Jewel Craft items. The Mask comes out of Lower Guk
and you have to get help to acquire it. The earlier the best. </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10
Points in Strength, 10 in Stamina and 5 in Agility</strong></p>

<p align="left">The hard thing about a fighting Bard is that no matter what you do, the
numbers will always be weak. As such, in this example, merely adding all the points into
Strength is not going to do much. You will dish out the damage, but your skills won't
improve at a better pace than usual, and neither will your Defensive abilities. I find the
lack of Defensive ability a problem, since one of the things that you can do later is use
Charm to protect group members from certain death, although I have seen many Bards simply
say &quot;I gave the healer mana&quot; and leave it at that ... meaning that the Bard just
kept on hitting and ignored the group's status. As such, I feel that this type of Bard
playing really defeats the purpose of a &quot;Bard&quot; in a group, other than a simple
Mana Battery which almost all fighting Bards are. The main question will be what happens
as the game changes from a Strength minded game into something else where Magical and
Charisma numbers are the most important thing to work with. The game in Kunark introduced
hard critters that had very important Resistances and Magical abilities and the Bard was
needed to help protect the players. In Vellious, things are too new to check out yet, but
a strong Magical Resistance is mandatory, it seems, and this means that this Bard will
have to use a song and instrument at a certain point, and this may not be the best
attribute this Bard has. As the game develops, the Bard merely playing the Mana song, is
coming to a close. Clerics and Enchanters nowadays will proudly say ... &quot;don't need
mana&quot;.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>To make a Magical Bard:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5
in Agility, 10 in Intelligence and 10 in Charisma</strong></p>

<p align="left">The importance of the Intelligence here, is to help the learning of all
skills move faster than usual. Not to have a skill drag on forever to improve, is an
important thing for this type of Bard. At level 35 or so, the raising of skills drops off
considerably, and top'ing off any of them is a problem. You can counter some of that with
Intelligence. Remember that with a Charisma Bard, you have to be able to get the
Instrument skills picked up. Your Wind and Brass skills need to be at the top, to ensure
that they only miss the usual 5%, not more than that at all, if possible.</p>

<p align="left">A lot of folks, would take the 5 poins in Agility and add them to
Charisma, and I think that is a good idea, were it not for the fact in the Agility test
that I did all the way to level 10 in many Bards, the <strong>Defense</strong> ability
rose much faster if the Agility number was higher, as it would in a Monk, for example.
Thus I like, personally, to add some points to Agility. Many will disagree here. </p>

<p align="left"><strong>To make a fighting Bard:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10
in Strength and 5 in Stamina and 5 into Dexterity</strong></p>

<p align="left">This is the toughest one to try. I have seen a couple of these Strength
minded Bards, and they were all punishment Bards, and I think the reason for it is the
really low Agility. But this Bard, to do damage, only needs Strength and some Dexterity to
help the weapons it carries do a little proc'ing. Personally, I am not sure why would
anyone select a &quot;fighting&quot; Bard, when there are other hybrids that can do better
damage, and get better attack ratios. This Bard, at its best in Weapons and such, will not
come close to even 85% of what the instruments and songs can do. But for its life, it is a
great support fighter and can play a mean Mana song. Personally I prefer the ability to
help other players in the group, and this Bard is not exactly suited to that at all. The
other thing that is noticeable here is the low Intelligence number, which will cause many
skills to lag seriously behind, other than the main fighting skills. Instrument skills?
What's that?</p>

<p align="left">I can not say, that these suggestions are perfect, and that they are
perfectly well thought out. These are based on my many small level Bards, and I wish there
was an efficient way to take them to level 20. I can tell you that the two toughest Bards
to bring down (not my main one, unffortunately) are the ones that have Agility in them. In
the Povar Moshkiae, at level 20, it has little equipment, but lots of Agility and it is
capable of holding itself rather well at the Keep/Highpass one level too soon. I hope to
take this one to level 30 to find out a little more about it. Skills are in excellent
shape though, as I added some Intelligence to it.</p>
