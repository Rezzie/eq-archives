<p align="center"><strong>10/05/2000 The Ygdrasil Journal of Poetic Arts</strong></p>

<p align="left">On this day, a massive work of poetry by Moshkiae Soulmender is released,
based on the event noted below for Myristica. The service and the surrounding events have
been blended to much poetry, as a tribute that would otherwise be left behind and
forgotten. It is Moshkiae Soulmender's belief that there are some things in life that are
above and beyond the call of duty and the pain and clarity that these events provide us
with should be a reminder of our love and understanding for each other. I would have
enjoyed participating in other events, and will if ever invited.</p>

<p align="left">You can see the issue at <a href="http://www.synapse.net/~kgerken">http://www.synapse.net/~kgerken</a>
for the October 2000 issue. After that it will be archived and saved in the National
Library of Canada. My heart tingles everytime I think of them.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>7/17/2000 The Myristica Service</strong></p>

<p align="left">There appeared on the Concert Hall Message Boards a message from Korendel
(a Bard) about the death of a very close friend. This player, had contacted Aids, and had
spent the last days of its existence playing Everquest, as it was the only relief and
enjoyment that she could otherewise undertake.</p>

<p align="left">This was embraced whole-heartedly, by the Everquest community and GM's in
the game, and they set about creating a service for Myristica, where Moshkiae Soulmender
of the Veeshan Chapter read a poem, which he had created for the Message Board. The event
pulled together a lot of players from other servers, most notably Rokken, who is the main
person behind &quot;EQsongs&quot;, the most important web site for Bards. </p>

<p align="left">Here is the text of the whole event, with the only editing done, being the
little conversations that did not pertain to the event itself.:</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>6/17/2000 Bristlebane Poetry Slam</strong></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Courtesy of the &quot;Succoring Winds Guild&quot; in
this server a major poetry slam was delivered in The Arena, on this particular Saturday.
For this occasion, there were three of our esteemed members that joined the event with the
hope of winning something. Surloch and Berrek, were just started for the event. Moshkiae,
at level 12, is the secondary character he plays, and will take to about 20 to facilitate
movement and help the original Stryngs of Ayre guild develop, whenever possible.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The results were somewhat disappointing, but Moshkiae,
Berrek and Surloch did make it to the quarterfinals in the Haiku section. In the Limerick
section, Surloch got as far as the semifinals, and what we had come up with was a beautful
quatrain, that was overwhelmed by a Troll bashin' language. In these events, fun is also
important, and it appears that not all judges have an eye for the serious, as well as the
fun ... we will ammend that in the future.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of itself, the Slam was magnificent, and the Troll that
won most of it, deserved it. She was prepared and ready to go, and most of us were not.
Berrek, Surloch and I specialize in &quot;free form&quot; and can create a poem at the
drop of a copper, but on this day it was not to be.</p>
