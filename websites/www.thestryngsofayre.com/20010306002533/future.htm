<p><strong>The future addition of any chapter of this Guild will now be handled strictly
via the person wanting to be leading that server.&nbsp; The new rules in regarding to the
forming, and maintaining a Guild, require that ten members be available and kept. This
means that if you are interested in a chapter of this Guild for your server, you must find
ten players, and have them ready, the day that we get the GM to create the Guild on your
server. This is incredibly difficult, but it is the new rule. We have the charter, and we
can use it on other Servers.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Even though this is hard, it will make, in the long run, things a lot easier
for myself, Moshkiae, and Crishandilynn, in that we will know that each leader will have
to function and maintain his/her chapter a lot tighter, or pass on the baton quickly so
the Guild does not die. In all servers, Cryshandilynn and myself are to be offered Officer
positions, so we can help when needed, and cover the space when appropriate.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Because of the events that have caused us to lose 5 chapters, Chryshandilynn
and I will keep the Leader status for a period of 30 days, which should be ample enough
for the player to prove their ability and desire to run the Guild. As sad as it maybe,
both Chryshandilynn and I spent an average of 6 hours in each server to get it created.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>I would love to see us involved in more servers, and get back to
having about 15 to 20 Guilds, but for the time being, this is good, and the 7 servers that
we have should really help us learn to work together and then work on making another
server when the time comes. We can use this page, for any server to keep track of the
players that they have come up with, so we can create any other chapter of the Guild.</strong></p>
