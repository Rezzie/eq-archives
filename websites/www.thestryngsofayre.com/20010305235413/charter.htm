<p align="center"><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Description<br>
A guild dedicated to the artistic side of the playing in the game of EverQuest. Hopefully,
in the future this will include the presentation of work of poetry, songs, music and other
ventures that will help add another dimention to the game of EverQuest. However, it is not
restricted to simply that, as any Guild is made up of people, and their hopes and desires
should also be met, whenever possible in this game. </strong></font></b></p>

<p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong><b>You can join our discussions, and communications, at
our <a href="mailto:stryngsofayre-subscribe@listbot.com">StryngsofAyre@listbot.com</a>
message board. After that it is simple and you send all mail to <a href="mailto:StryngsofAyre@listbot.com">StryngsofAyre@listbot.com</a> ...</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF"><strong><b><big><big><br>
</big></big></b>This Guild was originally started as a Bard-led Guild (adjusted later with
limitations) dedicated to the development and improvement of the Bard's class and its use
in the game of Everquest, not only as a player, but also in other elements which will
further the life experience of the players involved. Originally, the main focus of the
Guild was a hope that we could focus on any artistic work that we all wished to do, and
present. However, the nature of the Guild process, and the changes that Verant has made,
have caused these romantic notions not to be as wise, or helpfull, to maintain an active
chapter of the Guild. Each leader, is expected to be able to define rules and carry them
out, playing honorably being one of the most important ones. <br>
<br>
Some minor rules include twinking, not totally thought of as bad, but should not be
expected, but if there is a chance to help the young player be more effective, it would be
appreciated. Equipment is nice, but remember that the bread and butter in this game is the
actual playing and not just the equipment.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong>Eventually, the Guild hopes that we can have a
representative of each class, so we learn a better application of all our abilities in the
game to further our progress. </strong></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong><u>All Guild Chapters</u> must leave open, and procure,
associations with other Guilds, for the purpose of teaming up in higher and later levels.
We would like to achieve an &quot;Alliance&quot; status with a couple of major Guilds on
each server, so that we are also added to the midst of the Planes later, and selected for
play. This includes, being invited to group in many areas, or near areas where you might
be located, or bound. </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong><u>All Guild Leaders and Officers</u>, <big>MUST</big>
have an email address with which to get contacted. This is important in our efforts to
stay in touch with each other and make sure that we also allow/announce upcoming events.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong><u>Artists and Musicians</u>. There are players all over
Norrath, that do not work with a Bard in this game, and would like to be involved in this
Guild, since they are writers and musicians. We will look to accomodate these players
depending on their immediate contribution, but not until we all have agreed on a good
status for this. This will come in handy, later, when we attempt to put together a play,
that may need an Ogre/Troll, a Dark Elf, and so on, where we can role play some for the
purpose of the work at hand. I have a small play written for EQ, but it can't be done with
all Bards ... (suggest please) I have already had a couple of examples of this in
discussions with various other players that want to be a part of our Guild, just because
the name of the Guild is so different and whatnot.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#00FFFF"><strong><u>Other Guilds</u>. Would like to state,
here and now, that other Guilds, are NOT our competitors and we do not make any
disparaging remarks about them. Please conduct yourself accordingly. We wish to avoid bad
language, and any inter personal issues. We want to be considered a &quot;class act&quot;
and want us to be exemplary in that area.<br>

we have all agreed to. He/she has the right to name those to serve under them. Any other
roles, should be also added as needed, hopefully, on a wide basis, since this will be a
multi server Guild. </strong></font></p>

decisions as to allowing in members, and should/would assign the tasks of adding members
to the group for the purposes of enlistment, and defining the games/artistic work that we
will be doing. Guild Leader must be playing his/her main character the majority of the
time, so he/she will know what is happening on the server with the Guild. This requirement
is preferable.</strong></font></p>

something please turn it in to the guild, or give it away to a newbie, and sponsor them to
enter the guild.&nbsp; In return (at least on Bristlebane)&nbsp; we will try to have
events and things to give away items. Tho this is not the main stay of our guild at

leads in a guild event and who goes where. Plus it lowers the amount of time the Conductor
is adding members to the guild.&nbsp; These people will know the guildlines of adding
members and such. They can also step in if the Conductor or other is away and not present.
There isn't a hiearchy among them they are all equal standing in the guild.&nbsp; They all
will have current email addresses too.&nbsp; This is a requirement for these positions.

<p align="center"><font color="#00FFFF"><u><big><strong><big><big>C. Requirements<br>
</big></big></strong></big></u></font></b></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong>1. Bards are a definite add, given the name of the Guild.
But an emphasys on strong abilities to play and group is important in this game. Musical
names is a nice addition as well. And this might mean that you can/should not be afraid to
state to applicants that &quot;this guild may not be for you&quot;.<br>
<br>
2. Level 6 must/should be achieved, and playing status should be &quot;active&quot;.
Officers are required to be regular players on the server, and hopefully reached as often
as possible.<br>
<br>
3.Although the goals at higher levels change, it would be nice if this Guild could also
enforce and help add with the &quot;fun&quot; side of the game. <br>
<br>
4. Must be willing to participate in the events that the Guild will attempt to create. We
hope to share many of these events with all other servers and chapters of the Guild.<br>
<br>
5. Per request, more than once, ONLY Guild Organizers may decide if any of the
leaders/members of each chapter may use the &quot;Anonymous&quot; option in the game. As
Officers, we need to promote the Guild and the &quot;Anonymous&quot; status prevents that.
It has been brought to our attention that there are some harassment issues, and thus this
option will be left open to each leader to decide and help players with. We would prefer
that ALL players not use this option. </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong>7. Fun stuff. On a couple of servers there have been
sightings of Guards carrying Lutes, and on occasions, Drums. Our secret signature, should
be Fishing Poles. If there is to be found a Guard, in a designated city/area with a free
hand, it is our duty to fill that hand with a Fishing Pole.&nbsp; </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong>8. Quests. While I am not, personally, interested in how
each player and class acquires his/her Quest and Equipment, it is hoped that the higher
level players encourage these acquisitions. We will work on seeing that we can list the
critters, level, and moneys necessary for each of the Quests in these pages to help
everyone a little better. Here, alliances with other Guilds come in quite handy -- ie,
Guild X needs a Class for Lower Guk, and we send one, or even take a younger one that
might get a chance to loot needed items for quest, etc, etc, ... </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#00FFFF"><strong>9. Playing rules. The Play Nice theory is going to be
enforced. Rather than get into arguments over a spot, please be polite and uphold your
Guild and its beliefs. If it appears to be leading into an argument, it is often best to
just go somewhere else, and find another friend on the Guild chat to go play with. We will
not accept, and will discipline, people that do not wish to help uphold the important
status of the Guild in the community. We will be doing a lot of events all over and our
name will be passed around, and we must be aware of what we are doing and getting into.</strong></font></p>

--August 4. Updated pages and charter<br>
--October 11. Updated charter to reflect current state of affairs, and the request that
many high level players that are members of this Guild, do not necessarily reflect all
these beliefs. We do not want to lose friends, and this game has changes the rules in
regards to membership. We, now, need all the friends that we can have, and not being able
to accomodate them all, is basically a closed door policy that needs to be adjusted by all
leaders. I still have hopes of one of my publishing things will one day help others see,
that many of us are real people, in real life, and that we are &quot;artists&quot;. This,
should, in the future, bring a lot of attention and members to our guild.<br>
--October 13. Updated pages to reflect the deletion of the Veeshan server. Moshkiae
Soulmender will also be looking to change his Surname.</strong></font></p>
