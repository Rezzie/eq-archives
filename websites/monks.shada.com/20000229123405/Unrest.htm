<FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>The Estate of Unrest is located in Dagnor's Caldron on the continent of Faydwer check out </FONT><A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com/"><FONT FACE="Garamond">EQAtlas</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Garamond"> for the location. Unrest is a great outdoor dungeon zone for levels 15-35. There are six specific rooms that full groups can camp and five MOBS that drop unique items. Once inside the house general loot consists of some platinum, fine steel weapons, small bronze, and gossimer from hags. Refer to the Not Crazy map of </FONT><A HREF="http://notcrazy.com/collated/maps/zones/Faydwer/Unrest.shtml">Unrest</A><FONT FACE="Garamond"> for the location of these rooms</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Level 15 - 20:</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>You can get into a group or solo what most like to refer to as the yard trash. These creatures include Death beetles, Tormented dead, Ghouls, Jack-o-lanterns, Greater skeletons, Large wisps, and the occasional Lurking mummy. The best place to stay is against the courtyard wall behind or on either side of the house. This is to avoid the trains to zone.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Level 20 - 25:</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>You'll need to get a group together and hunt or pull from the 1<SUP>st</SUP> level of the house. On the 1<SUP>st</SUP> level you will find Ghouls, Lurking mummies, Dark bone skeletons, Dry bone skeletons, and Barbed bone skeletons. The Dry bone are casters so you will want to take them out as fast as you can.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Level 25 - 30:</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>Now is when you get to camp the unique drops on the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> &amp; 3<SUP>rd</SUP> floor. If you stay inside a room and don't let any of the creatures run from you, you will be safe from trains.</P>
<B><U><P>1 - Magi Room</B></U> - In this room there are 4 spawn points. Things that spawn in this room include Dry bone skeletons, Barbed bone skeletons, Dark bone skeletons, Skeletal monks, Carrion ghouls, the occasional Werebat and the Reclusive Ghoul Magi.</P>
<B><U><P>2 - Hand and Bug Room</B></U> - There is 4 spawn points in the bug room and 4 in the hand room. A pair of level 27-28 can do quite well here when the spawn is broken up. The hand room leads to a balcony for easy escape to zone. Here you will find Carrion ghouls, Dry bone skeletons, Skeletal monks, Bared bone skeletons, the occasional Werebat, and the Reanimated hand.</P>
<B><U><P>3 - The Bar Room</B></U> - There are 6 spawn points in here, but the problem here is that everything from the Tower above will come down also. For a successful camp both the Bar and the Tower much be camped. Things you will find in here include Dry bone skeletons, Carrion ghouls, Skeletal monks, Undead nobles of unrest, Werebats, and the Undead barkeeper.</P>
<B><U><P>4 - The Tower</B></U> - Located right above the bar. There are 4 spawn points in this room. For a successful camp both the Bar room and the Tower need to be camped as things from the Bar will attack you through the floor. In this room you will find Dry bone skeletons, Werebats, Festering hags, Greater dark bone skeletons, Skeletal monks, and the Undead knight of Unrest.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Garamond" SIZE=4><P>Level 30 - 35:</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Garamond"><P>The basement is the place for you. To get there click on the book shelf. There are two many areas down here, the Pit and the Ghost room.</P>
<B><U><P>5 - The Pit</B></U> - The pit has 7 static spawn points. Down here you will find Skeletal monks, Werebats, Dusty werebats, Greater dark bone skeletons, Mortuary fungus, and Festering hags.</P>
<B><U><P>6 - The Ghost Room</B></U> - If you go straight down the stairs into the pit and back up the other side you will go through a secret wall that leads to the Dwarven ghost. Follow the path and WALK THROUGH THE BLOOD POOL, on either side of the blood pool is a pit trap, and follow the wooden bridge to a cut out cavern area. This is where the ghost spawns. There are 4 spawn points in the pit under the wooden bridge, and 3 points around the ghost. When fighting in the ghost cut out nothing from the pit will join in unless you let something run from you. In here you will find Festering hags, Greater dark bone skeletons, Tentacle terrors, Dark terrors, and the Dwarven Ghost.</P>
