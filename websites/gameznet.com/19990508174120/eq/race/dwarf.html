<p>Dwarves are the stouts known as much for their love of the bottle as for their love of
adventure, and their fear of the sea. All dwarves start with a natural knack for sensing
direction which will help a lot at lower levels. Dwarves can be <a href="../class/cleric.html">clerics</a>, <a href="../class/paladin.html">paladins</a>, <a href="../class/rogue.html">rogues</a>, and <a href="../class/warrior.html">warriors</a>. <br>
<br>
Their natural strengths are their size(cheaper armor), <a href="../ability/strength.html">strength</a>
and <a href="../ability/stamina.html">stamina</a>. Their glaring weaknesses are their
atrocious <a href="../ability/agility.html">agility</a> and <a href="../ability/charisma.html">charisma</a>. Dwarves are by no means charming with their
lude mannerisms and their bearded woman. You will more than likely need to spend most of
your ability points on agility. <br>
<br>
Because of their agility dwarves do not really make the best rogues. I would recommend
playing as a different race if you wish to practice your thieving ways.<br>
<br>
Dwarves, while not the best warriors, are decent at that trade due to their strength and
stamina. In addition their small size allows them to spend less money on armor than their
larger counterparts would.<br>
<br>
Dwarves strength however lies in their clerics and paladins. Dwarves have a naturally high
wisdom, strength and stamina which are prime traits for either of these classes. The fact
&nbsp; that <a href="../zone/crushbone.html">Crushbone</a>(which is a clerics paradise
item wise) is so near is even more helpful to them.<br>
