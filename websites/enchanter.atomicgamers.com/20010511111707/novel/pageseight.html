						life and raced the room toward the child. Before she could even gasp the runes raced around her head and sank inwards
						until they only seemed to exist swirling within her blank eyes upon an emotionless face. Toorac moved closer to
						the bed, the tension of the mission now drown in the sorrow of his next act. Reaching within his robes he pulled
						out a dagger raising it to the light he studied the symbol upon the hilt, the symbol of the Wizards of Qeynos guild.
						Nodding to himself sure that all was as planned he steeled himself for his final act. Toorac placed the dagger
						above the girl's heart &quot;Forgive me but your soul is needed elsewhere and your death will stop those fools
						that seek to release dread upon our world, you will not feel it i swear&quot; and he thrust the dagger into the
						child's chest piercing the heart. As he watched the life drained from her eyes and Toorac was forced to fight back
						a tear. &quot;Forgive me child, but your death brings new hope to many&quot; He spoke silently to the child as
						if she would answer. Toorac regained his senses slowly realisig he was not yet out of danger. Standing he spoke
						the enchanted words again and carved the runes before him.</FONT></TD>

						Toorac watched as the moon hovered above the water and its gently swaying reflection. He had been standing on the
						main deck of the Seaking for hours now attempting to sort his emotions. He was elated at the fact of returning
						home to Erudin and his chest swelled at the thought of completeing his mission perfectly but a dark shadow hung
						over all the other emotions, the image of that innocent child would drown his elation and deflate his pride. As
						his thoughts raced back he would find himself questioning ,why? <BR>
						Lost in thought Toorac did not notice the last passanger head to below decks yawning and for a few moments longer
						the seaking and what seemed to be its only passenger sat in silence.<BR>
						&quot;You look troubled Initiate Toorac, &quot; a detached vioce barley a whipser came to Toorac &quot;you performed
						well you should be proud.&quot;</FONT></TD>
