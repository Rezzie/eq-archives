			<P><FONT SIZE="1">I am known on the Cazic-thule sever as Draconal, and for the sake of knowledge I am creating
			this Newsletter based on the Enchanters of Norrath and their chosen skill of Enchanted Jewelcraft. If you have

			<P><FONT SIZE="4">The patches just keep coming and in my opinion Verant are getting much better at both the game
			enhancements and handling the downtime for the patch. I would like to say that I'm also impressed by the new enchanter
			only quest items even though some of the items area a tad bit hard to get to it looks like they will be fun to
			do, maybe if enchanters gathered in a large group on a single day and used their masses to camp the hard to get
			items we would show how our class could band together to make great things happen.<BR>
			By the way I am sure you will notice that many of this months submissions are from me, the amount of submissions
			is very thin this month so if you have something to say or a tactic to share please submit. I would also like to
			have some new staff to help with articles. Thank you.<BR>
			<BR>
			By the way, if GZ or Verant are reading this excellent choice to add differing weapons to our pets they look great
			and the fact of enchanted items, you are well on your way to making this game rock even more than it does. Just
			a side note anyone notice that there was items called enchanted Fine steel long swords and such in the last GM
			event, hmmmm maybe the day of creating minor weapons of magic is close at hand.</FONT></P>

			<BR>
			High elves share their newbie area with the Wood elves making their newbie zone one of the most crowded, but it
			seems that these elves have adapted well and the amount of infighting is relatively low. High elves also start

			character name: Draconal<BR>
			Server: Cazic-Thule<BR>
			Level tactic good for: 12th to 15th<BR>
			<BR>
			Spells used: Mesmerize, Tashan, languid pace, root, chaotic feedback, choke<BR>
			<BR>
			Tactic Description: I used this little spell routine to get myself from 12th to 15th in Oassis in a matter of days
			soloing. First cast Mesmerize (the mob will now not attack unless it is hit with a damage spell meaning up until
			the first cast of chaotic feedback any resists can be recast) then cast tashans to lower the mobs resistance then
			languid pace (just in case root doesn't hold) then root, now once the mob is fixed in place cast chaotic feedback
			(mainly because its regen time is slow then cast Choke then chaotic feedback should be back up cast it once more
			then recast root and redo your damage spells. Just a note also if you are low on mana and the mob is high on Hps
			still wait until your choke dot runs out and cast mesmerize on the mob and walk away (note if your dot is still
			active it will break the mesmerize and send the mob after you again.) This kind of routine can be used into the
			higher levels just find your favorite debuffs cast mesmerize before the debuffs and then root and shoot.<BR>

			Server: Cazic-Thule<BR>
			<BR>
			Trade Skills and their shortfalls<BR>
			<BR>
			First of all before I give my opinion on the shortfalls of the trades I would like to say that Verant has done
			an awesome job on adding more to and responding to the tradesmiths.<BR>
			The most important shortfall that needs attention is the lack of degradation to items in everquest. This has spurred
			a problem with item overpopulation on old servers . Example is if one BBC (Bone Bladed Claymore) is looted every
			6 hours then in one month the server sees 120 of these appear now in a normal world this would be fine as many
			of those would dull or break reducing the amount available, unfortunately EQ is missing this function so over 8
			months there is now 960 of these swords sitting on the server they are no longer special as verant wished them
			to be and are very easy to come by for cheap. Why I use this example is if, due to overpopulation of BBCs, a tradesmith
			makes forged two handed swords and attempts to sell them for 30 plat with the stats of 12/45(i don't know the actual
			stats at the moment) non magical and a person is selling the BBC 17/50(or so) magical for 40 to 50 plat the tradesmith
			will lose out. This is also becoming an issue with magic jewelry there is an unbelievable amount of Silver and
			Electrum enchanted jewelry on each server. People are now able to use jewelry that was created and bought in the
			early days (after jewelry patch) and either hand it down to a new character, so we lose a customer, or sell it
			at a super competitive price, again losing a customer, and the problem is that that piece of jewelry is just as
			good after 5 months as it was the day it was made. Now in real life I would love to buy a pair of pants have them
			last for 10 years and then sell them to my friend for the same amount as I bought them but it doesn't happen. When
			you wear something it gets worn out, even if taken care of.<BR>
			Now I have talked with other Tradesmiths about this and no player enjoys the idea of having their equipment degrade
			but sooner or later the servers are going to be way to overpopulated with magic items (I laughed cause its akin
			to my first D and D game where my draconal had 20 +1 short swords and 10 wands of magic missiles and alot more
			due to ease of collection).<BR>
			The solution is simple to say but I fear alot harder for them to code (and as a hobby programmer I understand how
			hard it is to add code if you didn't think of it in the core coding) but items must begin to degrade. To make others
			happy in the game you could make it so that there is money sinks in the form of NPC smiths that can repair degrading
			items, I believe this would solve many problems. <BR>
			First it would solve tweaking because noone would waste a expensive to repair sword on a newbie char and if they
			do you can make the degradation based on calculations of the offensive skill (I mean if you know how to use a weapon
			you will do less damage to it and you will be able to take better care of it). Now without knowing the code limitations
			(such as if each item is a separate entity in the game or just a reference to a database line of stats) I think
			items such as weapons should degrade in speed and damage and items such as armor and bonus armor should have a
			wear and tear on them degrading them in either AC or their bonuses. As a idea that may be useable you could make
			such things as sharpening stones and maybe patch kits for armor time used on a base like food and water.<BR>
			Second it would revive the dying Tradesmith community. At the moment I am seeing more and more jewelers on my own
			server and they are driving the prices to a point where, with failures, I often lose money on a sale (even on very
			trivial items with a 100+ wisdom) also I have seen the amount of blacksmiths selling their wares drop to maybe
			one or two at the bazaar because they cannot get past the overpopulation of bronze and pre made banded armor. It
			has made it so the camping and selling looted items is not only more profitable but less likely to drain your money
			than making items by trades. Now competition is healthy but I cant see it as good if most all of us are suffering
			not because of competition against each other but instead against or own wares made two months ago real time (that's
			a long time in game hehe).<BR>
			Third it would bring another level of challenge to the day to day survival of a character in the world of norrath
			if you have to care for you armor and weapons as well as you Character himself.<BR>
			<BR>
			Oh and a minor idea also, how about replacing sense magic with recharge item so we can gain charges back on a item.
			Make this spell very slow casting and require a component also make it a mana hog. This is so a Stein of mogguk
			can not be used as a replacement to a healer. Just a thought :).<BR>

			<P><I><FONT SIZE="4" COLOR="#FFFBF0">Toorac continued down the hall until he came to a T, he knew to the left would
			be the kitchen and servants quarters, but with the time on his illusion drawing thin he could afford no more delays.
			Toorac quickly cast a glance over his shoulder to verify that the old man was not within sight, he was not. He
			chuckled to himself even if the old man had been in the hall Toorac doubted if he would be able to see far enough
			to tell which direction he had gone. Toorac turned his attention to the right hall, this hall would take him to
			the house secondary, the living quarters of the Nanny and the Lord and Lady's children.<BR>
			He increased his pace less interested in the paintings on the wall and more interested in fighting the waves of
			tension griping him as he approached closer to the apex of his mission. Toorac came to a stop midway down the hall
			before him was three doors, two on the right and one on the left. He cursed under his breath as he read the words
			on each door, not only did he despise reading common but his contact had been wrong about the placement of the
			rooms. His contact had told him that both children where bedded within the right rooms and the nanny's room was
			on the left. This was incorrect, Toorac made a mental note to pay a visit to his informant and discuss this infraction
			with him. With the nanny's room being beside the targets room it increased his danger, he would have to act fast.
			hurriedly he checked the door, a small smile graced the wrinkled face, they had not expected visitors and so have
			not locked the children's doors. With a lithe move Toorac twisted the latch and slipped into the dark room closing
			the door behind him. His eyes slowly adjusted as best they could from the torch light to the darkness within the
			room. In the shadows he made out the shapes of a dresser, a wardrobe, and reflecting the meager amount of moonlight
			intruding through the window was a full length mirror. Finally in the farthest corner of the room Toorac spotted
			the canopied bed and could barely make out the lumps that would form a sleeping child. Now that Toorac had his
			target in sights his heart raced and his head began to ache a bit, but fighting back this sensation he calmed himself
			and began to speak the words of his next spell. Once again he whispered the words that seemed barely audible yet
			seemed to scream through ones brain, also his hands once again traced streams of dull light into the air before
			him forming the mystic runes of his spell.<BR>
			&quot;Wh... wh.. who is there&quot; a small fearful voice chimed &quot;Hello is someone there&quot;<BR>
			Toorac opened his eyes and before him sitting up on the bed was the Lord of the house's daughter, her face illuminated
			by the reflecting mirror, . Toorac nearly choked as he saw the innocent face, almost missing his final words of
			the enchantment. With his recovery and the final word spoken the runes floating before him came to life and raced
			the room toward the child. Before she could even gasp the runes raced around her head and sank inwards until they
			only seemed to exist swirling within her blank eyes upon an emotionless face. Toorac moved closer to the bed, the
			tension of the mission now drown in the sorrow of his next act. Reaching within his robes he pulled out a dagger
			raising it to the light he studied the symbol upon the hilt, the symbol of the Wizards of Qeynos guild. Nodding
			to himself sure that all was as planned he steeled himself for his final act. Toorac placed the dagger above the
			girl's heart &quot;Forgive me but your soul is needed elsewhere and your death will stop those fools that seek
			to release dread upon our world, you will not feel it I swear&quot; and he thrust the dagger into the child's chest
			piercing the heart. As he watched the life drained from her eyes Toorac was forced to fight back a tear. &quot;Forgive
			me child, but your death brings new hope to many&quot; He spoke silently to the child as if she would answer. Toorac
			regained his senses slowly realizing he was not yet out of danger. Standing he spoke the enchanted words again
			and carved the runes before him. Once complete the runes swelled and swirled about him and within a second collapsed
			in on him, his form vanished, darkness and silence once again claimed the room.</FONT></I></P>
