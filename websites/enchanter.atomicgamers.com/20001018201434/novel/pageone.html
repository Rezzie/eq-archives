						<P><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="black">The sun danced on the horizon making the water sparkle as if imbued with magic,
						Toorac could make out the docks of Qeynos if he squinted his eyes almost hard enough to hurt. He did not look much
						different than the other passengers upon the Seaking other than his bright yellow robes that marked him as an Enchanter
						and his slightly larger forehead. As the mighty vessel drifted in to make contact with the dock many of the sailors
						where shouting in what Toorac knew to be common tongue, but what they said was so filled with slang that he knew
						not a single word.<BR>
						&quot;ALL ASHORE WHATS GOING ASHORE&quot; shouted a large burly sailor. <BR>
						With that the passengers moved toward the ramp which lead to the dock, some more quickly than others and some holding
						their stomachs displaying a unique shade of green. Toorac moved without urgency toward the ramp keeping an impassive
						face to hide his disgust of being in proximity to so many low humans.</FONT>

					<TD WIDTH="40%" HEIGHT="330" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="white"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="black">Normally he would not refrain from his haughty Erudite attitude but his current mission
						called for him to blend into the crowd, even if the crowd was filled with low humans.<BR>
						Toorac allowed the crowd to guide him through the busy streets of Qeynos, past all the vendors shouting their wares
						and the common people haggling for their next meal. The cobbled streets were small, unclean and the drab buildings
						were crowded together, he noticed, amused that it was as if the streets and buildings where a parity of their creators
						within the crowd.<BR>
						Keeping careful watch on the street names Toorac slowly shifted his path, almost imperceivably manipulating his
						position within the crowd. Anyone watching him would have seen a lost erudite caught up in a sea of drably dressed
						humans.<BR>
						But one set of eyes followed his every move as they drifted through the oblivious crowd not far from their target.
						The stranger seemed to read Toorac's mind shifting with him as he navigated the crowds.</FONT></TD>
