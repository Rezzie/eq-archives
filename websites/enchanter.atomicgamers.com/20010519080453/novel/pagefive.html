						sideeffect of the spell, &quot;De'ja vu&quot;, the thought that one had been here or done this before. Toorac grinned
						allowing the guards to think it was because he had won the discussion when in fact he was pleased the spells held
						so solid.<BR>
						Once inside the house Toorac drew on a map that he had commited to memory before leaving erudin, and remembered
						he found it almost childs play to memorize next to the complicated spells stored in that same mind. Toorac stood
						in the greeting hall, once again the family crest resounded thruout the room on banners, shields and even carved
						into the marble walls itself. The ceiling vaulted at least 40 feet into citiadellike arches, and the floor was
						covered in a fine wooven carpet depicting larger than life the master of the house enganged in a battle with a
						griffion. Before him was a great oaken fireplace and upon its majestic mantle sat a shiny brass shield with the
						family crest emblazed upon it. Hanging on the wall just above the shield was a jewel encrusted bastard sword like
						the one in the wooven picture. To his right two sets of stairs lead to a small balcony overlooking the hall, this
						Toorac knew was where the lady of the house would sit and watch over the master of the house as he greeted his
						guests and discussed his buisness,</FONT></TD>

					<TD WIDTH="40%" HEIGHT="330" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="white"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="black">a tradition that had gained favor among the low humans over the last few years. Below
						that balcony sat twin oaken doors braced by rune covered iron strips. Remebering the map he knew this would lead
						to the house proper, the living quarters of the master and lady of the house. But they where not why he was here,
						to the left of the fireplace sat a undecorated wooden door. Toorac smiled, the entrance to the house major where
						all others residing within these walls lived. <BR>
						Toorac moved at a swift but nonchalant pace toward the wooden door, this was the most dangerous part of his mission
						if he passed someone who had seen the old wizard pass moments before they may cast enough doubt to see through
						his illusion spell. His sources did tell him that after a evening visiting his guild the hired house wizard would
						normally head straight to his labratory to work on spells he had learnt that night. He passed through the door
						and entered a long narrow hallway decorated with the usual family portraits, each depicted a member alone or with
						others. Toorac stopped at one such portrait, upon it in vivid colors, obviously painted by a master, was a fairhaired
						girl in a flowing gown and at her feet a young boy dressed in fine black silk.</FONT></TD>
