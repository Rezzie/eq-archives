						&quot;Greetings Ashlak, blast any hill giants lately old man.&quot; the first guard said breaking into a grin and
						nudging the second guard in the ribs.<BR>
						&quot;Why yes I did Guard Rilek, and I belive he said he was your cousin just before he died&quot; the wizard beamed
						back with a great smile. The first guard's faced dropped in surprise though the second guard was now leaning upon
						his spear hilt in antempt not to fall over laughing.<BR>
						The first guard regained some of his witts, &quot;Quickly now old man, the master of the house will not wait forever&quot;
						he retorted casting a sideways glare at the second gaurd who even at that moment was losing his battle with gravity
						and sliding down the wall laughing.<BR>
						<BR>
						Toorac took no pleasure in the laughter but did use the noise to mask his movement as he slipped further into the
						dark side street. The enchanter found a Pitch black nook within an unknown shops wall, he carfully slid into the
						protective darkness and settled in for his next task.<BR>
						Toorac began to mutter Strange words just barly above his breath, yet if anyone where present they would swear
						the words echoed with a unearthly tone causing them to scream into thier mind.</FONT></TD>

						that seemed to float in the air before him. The dim light set his featues into a sinister glow as he opened his
						eyes to survay the runes. Then with one quick motion he pushed the palm of his hands outwards smashing rune into
						glowing rune, the very fabric of reality seemed touched by his spell as the area he stood seemed to ripple as a
						pond would if a child thru a pebble into it. Nodding in satisfaction Toorac began concintrating, remembering as
						his hands began to weave another rune within the ripples and once again he smashed the new rune with the palm of
						his hands. The ripples begain to gain mommentum growing to waves crashing upon realities shore itself, each wave
						held a slight change to Toorac's form. Wave after wave the second form seemed to overlay the first and each ripple
						held a different face, first that of an enchanter from a far off land the next an old human with a jovial look.
						Finally the waves calmed but where once stood a young Erudite in a flowing dark green robe now stood an old man
						in a dark red one.</FONT></TD>
