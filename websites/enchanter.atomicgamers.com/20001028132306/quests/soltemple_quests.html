			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#990000">Temple of Soulsek Quests</FONT></P>
			<P><BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Coin of Tash</FONT>: This is necessary to obtain a high level enchanter spell. Romar Sunto
			offers to give you the tashania scroll if you can find 10 coins in different cities around the world. He will sell
			you a book on where to find all 10 coins for 50gp and will give you a pouch to combine them in. The coins are called
			an old silver coin, and can be found in the following places: (1) Ak'anon - Near great wheel (not in water); (2)
			Kaladim - Pool by warrior's guild; (3) Erudin - in the pool outside the guilds in the palace; (4) Qeynos - Under
			Temple of Life UFO in the Koalindl Fish Pool; (5) Halas - In lake in front of city to the left of docks on a ledge;
			(6) Oggok - in lake near warrior guild at the north end; (7) Grobb - in pool near bar where you first enter the
			zone; (8) Neriak - Ouside blind fish window near ice comet rod; (9) Felwithe - at the edge of the fishing pond;
			and (10) Freeport - Under the mage guild building in the water. Take the 10 coins and combine them in the coin
			pouch to get a &quot;Coin Of Tash&quot;. Next, Take the coin to Tarn Visilin in the Highkeep Library and give him
			the coin. He will enchant it into a glowing coin of tash and give it back. Then take the coin to Mizr N'Mar in
			Neriak Library and give him the coin. He enchants it into a gleaming coin of tash. Then take the coin to Raine
			Beteria in Erudin Library and give her the coin. It is important to note that you must have a high faction with
			her or she will just keep the coin nd give you nothing in return. Casting Illusion Erudite and Benevolence before
			giving her the coin should take care of this problem. Take the coin that she gives you and return it to Romar and
			receive the tashania scroll (level 44 enchanter spell), which is no drop, so if you want this spell you have to
			do this quest. <BR>
			<BR>
			<FONT COLOR="#990000">Enchanter Incandescent Armor</FONT>: Sultin makes various incandescent items, plus the rod,
			which are for enchanters. <BR>
			<A HREF="../equip/incwand.html">Incandescent Wand</A>: He needs a Pouch of Silver Dust from the Dusty Werebat in
			the Estate of Unrest. He also needs a Silver Wand from the Silvered Guard in Cazic Thule, but asks that you get
			the wand enchanted before you bring it to him. Both of the components for this quest are no drop. Once you find
			the Silver Wand, take it to Ezmirella in the gypsy camp in North Karana. Hand her the Silver Wand and 50 gold coins.
			She will return a Blessed Silver Wand and instruct you to seek out Raine Beteria in the Erudin Library. Hand Raine
			the wand and 50 gold coins to receive the Glowing Silver Wand and the following faction adjustments: MerchantsofErudin,
			HighCouncilofErudin, HighGuardofErudin get better. You must have a good faction for this, so you may need to use
			benevolence. Take the Enchanted Silver Wand and Pouch of Silver Dust back to Sultin. Hand him both and he will
			give you the Incandescent Wand. <BR>
			<A HREF="../equip/incmask.html">Incandescent Mask</A>: He needs a Glowing Mask, found on the skeletal monk in the
			caverns of Guk (I have also been told you can get one on the froglock scryer) and all three Runes of Fortune. One
			Rune can be found on the Dark Elf Enynti in the Chasm below Castle Mistmoore. The other two can each be purchased
			for 50 golden coins each - one from Mizr N`Mar in the Neriak City Library and the other from Madam Serena in Qeynos.
			<BR>
			<A HREF="../equip/incgloves.html">Incandescent Gloves</A>: He needs to sew together four other sets of gloves to
			make these. Glowing Gloves from Shadowed Men, Radiant Gloves from Radiant in the mazes of Cazic Thule and Enchanted
			and Gleaming gloves. For Gleaming Gloves you have to give Tarn Vislin in Highkeep a bloodstone he will then give
			you Gleaming gloves. Bring 50gp to Tizina of the Lavastorm Gypsies. She will then hand you the Enchanted Gloves.
			<BR>
			<A HREF="../equip/rodoig.html">Rod of Insidious Glamour</A>: He needs a golden rod (from a froglok priest in guk)
			and an enchanted shining stone. The enchanted shining stone is made from a shining stone from shadow men, take
			that stone to Cynthia, a gypsie in the rathe mountains and give it and 50gp to get it enchanted. Then go to Highkeep
			and get the stone transmuted to do this give the glamour stone (that you got enchanted from Cynthia) and 50gp to
			Tarn Vislin in HHKeep, He gives you back the glowing stone of glamour (this is the stone you turn in with the rod).
			The two steps for getting the stone each raise faction with beta neutral and can be done separately from the rest
			of the quest for those who just need a faction boost.
