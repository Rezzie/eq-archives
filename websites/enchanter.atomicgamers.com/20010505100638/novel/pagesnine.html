						cloak so dark it seemed to steal the light from near it. With instant recognition Toorac spun and bowed his head
						in respect &quot;Master, the council does me honor by sending you to greet me.&quot; Toorac raised his head and
						was caught surprised, the shadow still remained head bowed in a sign of respect not given to Initiates.<BR>
						&quot;No Initiate Toorac you do us honor, from the moment you stepped forward to take this mission.&quot;<BR>
						Toorac was caught speachless, he had never expected to see one of the council here let alone hear him praise an
						initiate so highly. The world seemed frozen for Toorac as confusion gripped his mind &quot;why would a council
						member come to him&quot;<BR>
						The shadow raised his head and Toorac noticed that the light would never seem to reach past the dark hood leaving
						his face in a perminent darkness. &quot;The Mission you performed so well has given us time to contemplate our
						next move,&quot; The shadow shifted hesatently and cast a quick glance around making sure they were still alone</FONT></TD>

						Toorac's face grew dark &quot;So the death of that girl was to asure this one man will not rise to power?&quot;<BR>
						&quot;Calm yourself Member Toorac there are folds below what you think you know. That girl's soul has walked this
						world many times in many forms and holds a key to a power that would best not found until we are ready for it&quot;<BR>
						&quot;It is good Master i feel the wieght of this deed ...&quot; Toorac stopped his face twisted in confusion &quot;Member?
						Master i have not yet passed the tests.&quot;<BR>
						&quot;Your performance today has more than proven your prowess and skill the title is yours&quot; Toorac stood
						stunned a moment longer as it set in he was at last a member, he had strove for so long for this day.<BR>
						The shadow shifted once more his arms moved under his cloak but Toorac was to distracted to notice or care. &quot;Now
						Member you understand how important your mission was? But it is not complete.&quot; Toorac seemed to awake from
						his thoughts at that.</FONT></TD>
