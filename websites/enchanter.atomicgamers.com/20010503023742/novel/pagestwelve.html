						the same size as his head, not a good sign. Sparking into action with practiced precision Mori performed a series
						of rapid punches to the Ogre's midsection followed by a low sweep of is right foot that would have taken the legs
						out from under any normal man. It took a second for Mori's mind to register that his foot had stopped dead after
						connecting with the Ogre's leg and that his punches had done little if not nothing to the brute before him. Looking
						up once again he saw the Ogre's grotesque face twist into an evil smile. &quot;You've got to be kidding me&quot;
						Mori's shoulders sagged a bit as the rest of him tensed preparing for the painful response to come. <BR>
						Draconal sat in the far corner of Crow's distant enough from the fight that he remained untouched, for now. He
						had always enjoyed watching Megien fight though he could never figure how a wood elf brought up in the peace and
						tranquility of the druids guild could enjoy such chaos. Shrugging the thought off Draconal searched the crowd for
						his other companion, Moribund, catching a glimpse of him just as the mountain of Ogre blocked him from sight.</FONT></TD>

					<TD WIDTH="40%" HEIGHT="330" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="white"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="white">Trusting Mori's skill at fighting but also knowing how, in this case, size does matter
						Draconal stood preparing to assist. Locking his eyes onto the Ogre Draconal raised his hands and began to trace
						runes in the air before him &quot;Memory is slurred, reality blurred&quot;. The runes exploded in a flash that
						echoed about the ogres head. Draconal smiled and opened his mind sending a message into moribund's mind &quot;It
						will only hold him a second&quot;. The message returned quickly and with a hint of joy &quot;All I need Mate&quot;.<BR>
						Moribund once again shot into action this time leaping in single steps first a chair then onto a table and from
						there he used all his might to force himself high above the ogre's head grabbing hold of a cross beam there. Mori
						swung himself up and over the beam gaining incredible velocity as he swung down from the apex, extending his foot
						into a likeness of a flying kick he let go of the beam and sailed straight at the dazed ogre's head. Seconds later,
						standing over the passed out giant, Mori was attempting to figure out which was louder his foots impact with the
						Ogre's skull or that skulls impact with the floor.</FONT></TD>
