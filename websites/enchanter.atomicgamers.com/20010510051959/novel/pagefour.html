						to the street. As he arrived he found the two usual guards still at thier posts, the first guard seemed sullen
						and was not looking at the second who still chuckled to himself ever once in a while. Toorac was raiseing his hands
						to begin his next spell when he got the shiver again, a moment of panic gripped him, had someone seen his casting?
						Able to calm himself Toorac thought &quot;No, noone is here but myself and the two guards&quot; and with his fragile
						confidence rebuilt he returned to his duties. Once again he scribed runes but these runes were very much darker
						casting almost no light at all and were very much quicker to scribe. Once the runes were done Toorac's ancient
						brow creased as he searched first for the minds of the guards then finding them he sought a single memory in a
						sea of thoughts, satisfied he had found the memory he seeked Toorac waved his wrinkled hand and scaterred the runes
						before him.<BR>
						Both guards stood stunned for a second, eyes blank as if they were staring into a viod that noone else could see.
						Toorac knew that his que as an actor in this play was at hand, gathering his robes into one hand he scurried across
						the street toward the stunned guards. Slowing his pace and casting a sideways glance he positioned himself a few
						meters infront of the guards.</FONT></TD>

						they were frozen.<BR>
						&quot;Greetings Ashlak, blast any hill giants lately old man.&quot; the first guard said breaking into a grin and
						nudging the second guard in the ribs.<BR>
						Toorac took this as a good sign his memory blur had taken now if it would only hold. This close to the guards he
						found his source had not lied each guard had a monicule of sight over one eye, his invisability spell would have
						been useless against them. Toorac instatly filed the rest of the information given to him the magical traps and
						alarms that would make entry and possibly rapid exit much harder.<BR>
						&quot;Why yes I did Guard Rilek, and I belive he said he was your cousin just before he died&quot; Toorac knew
						to make the spell hold perminant he must overlay this moment exactly upon the other. The first guard's faced dropped
						once again in surprise and the second guard began his stuggle not to break out laughing.<BR>
						The first guard once again recoverd, &quot;Quickly now old man, the master of the house will not wait forever&quot;
						he retorted casting a sideways glare at the second gaurd who was again sliding down the wall laughing.</FONT></TD>
