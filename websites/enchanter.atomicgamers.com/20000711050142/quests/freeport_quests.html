			<A NAME="Exotic%20Drinks"></A><FONT COLOR="#990000">Exotic Drinks</FONT>: This quest is probably the best quest
			in the game for a lower level magic user, especially an enchanter. In fact, with the new changes, only an enchanter
			(or perhaps a very careful dark elf) can really do the whole thing. It results in the <A HREF="../equip/stienofmogguk.html">Stein
			of Moggok</A>, a great magic item which gives +10 int, +5 dex, +10 hp, +25 disease resistance, has two charges
			of healing and acts as a greater light source. The items can be collected by just about anyone, but you need to
			to be an enchanter to finish the quest. I know the quest works every time with a level 20 enchanter who has illusion
			ogre and benevolence. It also can work in some instances with a level 12 enchanter who has illusion dark elf and
			alliance. It is a lengthy quest, requiring you to go all over the world to get items, but worth it. Clurg, the
			Ogre bartender in Ogguk, has lost his bartender's compendium and wants it back badly. It is currently held by Bartender
			Gregor, in Freeport. Fortunately, Gregor has a lust for exotic drinks, and lacks only the ingredients to make his
			dream concoctions. He will give you the compendium for those ingredients. He wants you to get him the following
			items: (1) a Kiola Nut, which can be purchased on the island of Erollisi for about 2 gp, (2) Erud's Tonic [now
			a no drop lore item] (see Erudin quests, basically a quick purchase and exchange), (3) Honey Jum from Rivervale
			(See Rivervale Quests - the price is now 30 gold) [note: You need an indifferent faction in Rivervale for this
			one or you need to trust a halfling to get it for you. If you can't find a trustworthy halfling, (I had the misfortune
			of initially getting ripped off by a particularly nasty halfling named Mappas who believed he could extort 5 pp
			for the honey jum after I gave him the items and a promise of 5 gp to get it [back when it only cost 5 gp for the
			item]) you can easily create one of your own and do the exchange since a level 1 can easily do this part of the
			quest], and (4) a Koalindl Fish from the lake in the Temple of Life in Qeynos [now a no drop lore item]. This is
			the hardest and most costly part of the quest. You will take a severe faction hit with several good factions and
			with Rodcet Nife himself for killing the fish, dropping several levels in faction, and you will get attacked and
			killed when you leave the water unless you gate in time. (There is also a paladin who will jump in and kill you
			in the water if he is nearby). The fish do not drop a corpse every time, so you may have to kill several fish,
			potentially making you kos with many clerics afterwards. Also, they are a slow spawn and are currently being camped
			quite a bit. I don't know if this will work, but it might be possible for two people to do this with one creating
			a mule to kill the fish and take the faction hit, while the enchanter who will complete the quests loots it and
			gets the item. As another alternative, Frostbite the Dog in WK sometimes drops a Koalindl fish if his master is
			not around, but you lose some serious faction for this as well and one of the people you lose faction with happens
			to spend a lot of time in Gregor's bar, making it tough to complete the quest if you become kos with her. Although
			the resulting drink sounds pretty foul to me, should you manage to gather all of these ingredients he promises
			to give you his bartender's compendium. The enchanter must give Gregor the ingredients. I have been told that some
			people have had the quest fail by giving him all of the items at once (it will say he only got one) and others
			have had no trouble. I would suggest to be safe that you give them to him one at a time. Gregor will then give
			him 3 to 4 pp and the bartender's compendium, which is a no drop item. This has to be taken to Ogguk and given
			to Clurg the bartender there. Be aware that even under an illusion some ogres might attack you, so it might help
			to go invisible. Before giving it to Clurg, the enchanter needs to cast illusion ogre and benevolence. Or as an
			alternative, cast illusion dark elf and alliance (this lets it be done by a lower level enchanter, but does not
			seem to work every time). If his or her faction is not good enough, it won't work (I have had reports that indifferent
			has worked for some people and not worked for others, but that is probably the minimum he should con). Clurg will
			then give you the stein. I would say, assuming you can get sow when needed, you can do this quest in just about
			3 hours (less if you have teleports).
