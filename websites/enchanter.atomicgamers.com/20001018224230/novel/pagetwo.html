						and found himself alone on the side street. For the first time since the Seaking docked Toorac noticed that the
						sun had crested and the torches lining the streets where causing the shadows to dance merrily upon the building
						walls. Toorac felt a shiver pass his spine and instantly scanned the deserted street, Nothing. After gathering
						his composure Toorac continued down the dimmly lit street and listening to the timed scrape of his shoes on the
						cobbles quickly lost himself in thought, never noticing the quiet shadow moving and dancing within the others upon
						the wall.<BR>
						Before long Toorac found himself standing before a large home, bright blue banners hung from the third level portraying
						a family crest of a unicorn overlaped by a jewel encrusted sword. Toorac smiled, this was the emblem he was looking
						for. Casually shifting his position into the shadows he noticed the two guards standing watch within the recessed
						foyer.<BR>
						&quot;Now for the wait&quot; whispered Toorac moving deeper into the solid shadows and adjusting his stance so
						as to lean against one of the cold brick walls of the sleeping buildings. Again Toorac missed the slight motion
						of his predator shifting himself into a more comfortable position as the night closed over both of them.</FONT></TD>

						It had felt to Toorac as if he had been waiting for hours and that the sun would surely rise any moment ,but in
						truth it had been no more than an hour and a half he had been waiting. He was almost to his breaking point when
						he heard someone walking in his direction whistleing an extremly annoying tune. <BR>
						&quot;Finnaly&quot; Toorac moved his lips and the sound barely escaped.<BR>
						The figure moved at a gingerly pace down the dim street, but even at this distance it was easy for Toorac to recognize
						the figure in the dark red robes as a wizard.</FONT></TD>
