						&quot;The connection to the council must never be found even with your work there are still possibilities of discovery.&quot;
						Toorac had not even begun to contemplate the Master's word when a jet black dagger flashed between the master and
						Toorac. &quot;It will be short you will feel nothing it is the way for all honored members.&quot; saddness filled
						the masters voice.<BR>
						Toorac looked down at the dagger plunged into his chest, he was amazed all he felt was a slight cold between his
						ribs and his heart skipped a single beat as the tip of the dagger peirched it. slowly he felt a warmth cover his
						heart and spread as the posion discharged from the dagger's tiny hollowed tip. A taste of honey came to his tounge
						and he felt his eyes begin to close, though his mind stayed strangly aware of all of what was happening to him.
						&quot;I am a member and will forever be one with the council, and the council is one with Norrath and forever exist.&quot;
						Toorac calmly thought as his mind slowed and he sucumed to sleep.The shadow held Toorac until his last breath came
						easily, his still face still harboured a slight smile. Without delay the shadow reached once more into his cloak
						and withdrew a crystal.</FONT></TD>

					<TD WIDTH="40%" HEIGHT="330" VALIGN="TOP" BGCOLOR="white"><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="black">Laying the crystal over the dead man's chest the shadow began to chant in an ancient
						harsh tounge which sounded as if rocks being ground, of howling winds, the crackle of fire as it danced, and the
						sound of waves crashing against a shore.<BR>
						A dull light appeared withing the crystal and began to pulse growing in intensity until it became hard to look
						at. Then with a final phrase a bright flame licked out of the crystal engulfing the body. Then an oval of blue
						engulfed the flames and the body, pulsing as the crystal did but growing dimmer and smaller with each pulse until
						it had faded. In the end all that remained on the deck was a silent kneeling shadow with a dimly glowing crystal
						craddled within his hands. &quot;It is done another has been joined&quot; joy seemed to echo in the shadows words.<BR>
						Even as the shadow spoke his last words many old scribes deap within each of the cities of Norrath raised thier
						witherd hands reaching for thier quills and with the other hand opened the great book resting before them. In unisen
						quill to paper they each wrote upon a blank page &quot;Member Toorac Teloran - Caster of the Council - Joined with
						the crystal - Comendation - suggest resurection when needed&quot; and they closed the books resting thier quills
						each returned to thier meditation.</FONT></TD>
