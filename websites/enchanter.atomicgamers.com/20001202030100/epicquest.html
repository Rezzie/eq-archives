			Stofo Olan: 'Good day, I have discovered something truly wonderful! If I only had the materials required so I can
			copy my notes and send them to my teacher. <BR>
			You: 'what materials?'<BR>
			Stofo Olan: 'The materials I need are a mechanical pen, ink of the dark, and white paper. Bring me those and I
			will give you a copy of this information. <BR>
			You: 'who is your teacher?'<BR>
			Stofo Olan: 'My teacher is Jeb Lumsed. He was last seen in the regions of the newly discovered lands. If you wish
			to find him that is where you must seek him out. <BR>
			You: 'where is the mechanical pen?'<BR>
			Stofo Olan: 'The answer you seek is in your question. If you are unable to figure it out, then perhaps you are
			not ready to travel along this path. <BR>
			You: 'what is ink of the dark?'<BR>
			Stofo Olan: 'Dark illusions, thievery, and the plague of the living will guide you. These are the only hints I
			can provide. Safe travels and may you be protected from all maladies. <BR>
			You: 'what is white paper?'<BR>
			Stofo Olan: 'It may seem like ordinary paper at first. However, this paper was enchanted by a friend of mine. This
			paper was given to a lass in the Karanas to help with her writings. The paper will guide her hands and draw forth
			the thoughts in her mind. I no longer have any and I have not had contact with my friend in some time. Search them
			out.<BR>
			You: 'What did you discover ?'<BR>
			Stofo Olan: 'I was researching a new spell, and discovered new information concerning the history of the Serpent<BR>

			<BR>
			You: 'What do you know about a mechanical pen?' <BR>
			Rilgor Plegnog: 'Why do you want one of those contraptions. You will spend more time repairing it then you will
			writing with it. But if you insist on getting one, you are going to have to do a small favor. <BR>
			You: 'What small favor?' <BR>
			Rilgor Plegnog: tugs at your robe and grins evilly. Mighty nice outfit you have there. Sure beats these drab robes
			us three are wearing. Hmm...my favorite color is purple, in fact a shiny metallic purple would do nicely. How bad
			did you want that pen?<BR>
			You: Give him your Shiny Metallic Robe (Lower Guk on Arch Ghoul Magi)<BR>

			Chrislin Baker: slowly lifts her head. 'Have you brought any writing materials for me? The last few supplies I
			had were stolen.'<BR>
			You: 'what writing materials'<BR>
			Chrislin Baker: 'A passing illusionist gave me some enchanted writing materials. He said they would help inspire
			me to capture my mind's images on paper. If you would just be so kind as to bring me plain old paper and a quill
			from Qeynos, I can get back to writing. <BR>
			You: Turn paper and Quill<BR>
			Chrislin Baker: gives you a hug. 'Thank you so much. I did some cleaning after you left and found this behind a
			barrel. It may have been left behind by the person who took my materials. You can have it.' (It’s a bandit sash)<BR>
			Thraken Grifton in west karana is the bandit you need to kill to get the white paper back. He is about level 55.<BR>

			say: 'what serpent?' <BR>
			a sarnak imitator: 'The first truly powerful enchanter, Krilan Pedin, crafted the Serpent years ago. He trained
			his students to carry on the trade in a five-step process. Each student then became a master and chose one of their
			own students to pass the legacy on to. Four others and I, myself, are current practitioners of the crafting.<BR>
			You: 'who are the four other masters?' <BR>
			a sarnak imitator: 'The masters are enchanters who have reached the plateau of understanding. Their names are Modani
			Qu'Loni, Mizzle Gepple, Nadia Starfeast, and Polzin Mrid. All are master crafters in their own right. <BR>
			You:'who is modani?' <BR>
			a sarnak imitator: 'Modani is a master of illusions. You should seek him out first. Keep a careful eye out for
			him - he is never in his true form. The last time I spoke to him, he seemed very excited about his voyage to the
			elven outpost. You may or may not find more clues about his location there. <BR>
			You: 'who is mizzle?' <BR>
			a sarnak imitator: 'Mizzle is a gnome who has mastered the use of enlightened magic. Go to him once you have spoken
			to Modani. Mizzle is not one to travel, so you should not have to look far from his home to find him. <BR>
			You: 'who is nadia?' <BR>
			a sarnak imitator: 'The mistress of charm, Nadia is very beautiful. She, too, traveled with her relatives to the
			new land. I just recently received a letter from her. She says more and more pilgrims and explorers are arriving
			every day, and that the outpost is well defended now. <BR>
			You: 'who is polzin?' <BR>
			a sarnak imitator: 'Master of the Phantasms - he is the last one you will seek out. Hmm...Polzin is native to Erudin,

			Modani Qu`Loni says 'Ah yes, Jeb's seal. The time to craft a Serpent must have come. I will need components collected
			to craft the first of the pieces. I will also provide you with a sack in which you must combine the items. Are
