<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimdom</div><div class="date">07-19-2000, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good spot to solo from lvls 44 to 48 is the giant camp in FV.  It is up the east wall, north of the dog temple.  3 Giants spawn there.  If you are sitting on the hill facing west, the one on your right can be pulled solo if you go around the hut to the right and pull it that way.  The others can often be separated using Pacify.  If it does not work run away with sow for a while until they just go back to their camp.  sow is essential for that.<br />
<br />
Med on the hill, wanderers are rare but do come by sometimes.<br />
<br />
I got great xp there - and pretty good loot too.  Some people got a Forest Loop, though I did not in 3 levels (ack!).  Beware of Verdants though - I can just barely solo them at  47.  The spawn time is around 6 minutes, which is almost exactly the amount of time I need to med back up.  This worked out very well :-)   <br />
<br />
I Basically use a Root and Shoot tactic, though I keep a blinding spell memmed in case Root breaks a lot.  Sometimes I Root - Blind - Retribution.  That way I don't get hit when Root breaks, though they do run and you have to root them fast so they don't get to far.<br />
<br />
I bound myself at the bank, which is only a few minutes run away in the same zone.  Handy.  The bridge in FV is a common place for bodies to be dragged to - and I did a fairly steady res business (I never charge, but some people just insist on donating  hehe).<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />
