</FONT><HR>The NBG issue even gets more into a grey area when you start to consider the rare spell drops, and some of the quest armor drops that are needed in the post 50 levels.  For example, I am level 59, have been on several raids that Mark of Karn spell has dropped and have never received the spell due to either random rolls, merit awards, or NBG.. I think that on a couple of the random roll losses I have taken I should have been awarded the spell simply because I was the only cleric on the raid that was high enough level to cast the spell.  On the merit raids, I also felt a bit frustrated because the spell was awarded to a cleric three levels lower than me at the time and he could not scribe the spell either, but I knew that could and probably would happen ahead of my participation in the raid.   <BR>The same can be said for the armor quests.  Many classes need that "corroded" piece.  How would NBG work there?  I guess my answer to the whole delema is to know your group, discuss the drops before they happen and agree to participate or politely decline.  I have attended raids from almost every possible angle, and the bottom line is to trust the ones that are leading the raid, or the ones in your group.. If you don't have that feeling of trust, then don't join em on their hunting adventures.

</FONT><HR>OK, I read a couple replys, even tho I said I wasn't gonna :P<P>This case is a bad example of a normal NBG situation (IF ALL party members were cool with hooking Dikmer up.)  I think that's a great thing.  All people should be so nice.<P>If his party members didn't care what Dikmer does with the boots (wear or sell), then all is totally cool.  But if I was in Dikmer's group, and he told us that he was going to sell the boots (ASAP) to buy gear, I would ask to roll against him.  Hay, I'm poor too.  I could use upgrades on my crappy armor probably just as much as he does (err... did.)<P>(Probably not really - If there's any combo of race/class in EQ that can get to level 60 with crap gear it might be High Elf Cleric with maxxed base WIS of 135, or possibly Erudite INT casters with maxxed base INT.) <P>Here is an interesting interpretation of NBG:<P>NBG = I am poorer than you.<BR>(All my gear + All my plat is worth less than All your gear + All your plat.)<BR>Therefore, I need the drop more than you do (so I can sell it.)<P>At least tomorrow you will be eligible for the NBG drop, since now I'm richer than you.<P>Some incentive to level fast and not spend time or money on good upgrades, because the day will come when you are high level and ALL drops will go to you, since you CLEARLY need them more than anyone else.<P>Once again, though, if his party members wanted him to have the drop, then none of this is an issue.  If not, than Dikmer did indeed abuse the NBG system (in knowing beforehand that he was going to sell it.)<P>Trawma Siirjen<BR>46 High Elf<BR>United Legions<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Nazrin: "It really comes down to common sense here and thinking of others before yourself hence greed."<P>So if a lammy drops a warrior should think "i bet this cleric can trade this for a sarnak battle shield and a piece of donals. No need for me to be greedy, ill let him have it." <P>The whole concept of NBG is flawed and unfair. Please, tell me how it is greedy to want to improve your character so he/she can contribute more to a group? It ISN'T! The bare-bone fact is that my cleric can be a better cleric and contribute more whether i can use the item then and now, or sell the item to buy something i can use. We ALL risk the time, therefore we ALL should have the SAME opportunity to make our characters better. <P>If a piece of Donal's drop, i dont care if everyone rolls on it. Cause i know that the next drop might be something i can trade for it later. All i want is for everyone in the group to have the same chance to improve their character. So im "greedy" because of that? Yeah, right. I deem those that deny others the same chance to improve their characters the greedy ones. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Heh, gotts love all the controversy I stir up. /sigh<P>I did not know I was gonna sell the boots. I didn't even know they were worth 20k. Someone in FV inspected me and asked to by them, I said I would consider it for the right price. Now, I had no idea 7k wasn't really alot of money, cause when I left 9 months ago, 7k WAS alot of money. When I was offered 7k and a spirit tome, I thought, geee, now I can buy the stuff I need. Up til then, I planned to wear them, as for 2 days I used them in LoIO to kill green gobs to raise FV faction.<P>In reality, the cleric who bought my boots got off with a really good deal (screwed me in a sense, but I don't mind at all), and I got new gear which I needed desperatly.<P>To date, I have only EVER accepted one item that I did not want or had no intentions of useing, on the sole basis that I could sell it, and that item caused me a ton of grief. I learned my lesson there, and make it known up front that if I win a lotto on an item I can't use or don't want, I will either give it to a guildmate or sell it outright. <P>Shrug, be that as it may, I still believe in NBG. I have not yet won a lotto on an item not needed in the group, and I have seen alot of good items go to people who seemed to need it at the time. As long as someone gets something they can use, I think NBG works.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Geez, you PvP people are just mean.  Oh, and 130 max base wisdom with a high elf, just to clue you in.<P>Dikmer had every right to do what he did, because of the fact that he did not obtain the first pair with the intent to sell them.  He NEEDED the boots because they were worthwhile, and because he has been away so long after a horrible mishap, he thought he was getting a very good deal and getting himself in the clear with the people that he borrowed the items from as well as setting himself up so that he could properly heal people in more difficult situations.<P>As for the second pair, by Dikmer's own words he announced to the group that "hey, I won the pair the other day as these other two people saw, and I cleared up my debts with them and am now starting back on my way to becoming self-sufficient again" and the group STILL gave him the boots.  That was the groups decision.  Some people do actually have feelings, compassion, and empathy towards their common man, and I suppose short little dorfs on the off days =P<P>So, now Dikmer is self-sufficient, wearing Donal's boots which he will not be selling, and getting back into the groove of the game and trying to find himself a pair of Donal's gauntlets.  There is nothing wrong with that.<P>Need before greed is NOT a bad system, okay so you don't get to win on the Lammy's or cobalt that drops, big deal, how would you feel if you were a warrior and a cleric won your prized Cobalt Bracer (drops around 1/2 as much as the Donal's Gauntlets)?  So a tank goes and sells the items they win, guess what, welcome to no res/no group/bye bye groups for you list!  Sucks for them when they walk into Seb and can't find a group because they know he's a greedy, two faced, lying jerk!<P>Oh, and most of the time, when someone gets a replacement for the item, the replacement item is lotto'd to the group, at least in 90% of the groups I've been in, and it works well for everyone.<P>Machia Soleo'Sano<BR>57th year Priestess<BR>Sol Ro<P>(edit: oh, and try carrying both the Gauntlets of the Black for wis/str/ac situations and Donal's for buffing/ac situations =P)<p>[This message has been edited by Machia Velli (edited 04-06-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Class A can use the item IMMEDIATELY, Class B can use the item to obtain a needed item at a later time. Therefore Class B is "despicable"? That makes NO sense at all. <P>You seem to think that if a cleric wins a piece of cobalt, he is going to sell it for plat and throw all the money in the bank and gloat over it. Thats NOT the reality of it and you know it. That cleric is going convert that cobalt into items that will make him be a better cleric. HOW IS THAT GREEDY? That piece of cobalt WILL make a character more effective, one way or the other. There is NO greed involved in it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Here's my take on the situation:<P>Dikmer, the group gave you the second pair out of compassion, something that thankfully is NOT dead. You did nothing wrong, and would have been perfectly happy if the group HAD randomed the second set of boots.<P>NBG works only if the people agree to it and DON'T think of themselves first. It's a LOT easier to justify "I need the item because......" than it is to think "(S)he needs the item because..."<P>Yes, people abuse the NBG policy, but these people QUICKLY become well known for their actions. As for straight randoms, if it was my first raid/group/zone-visit, and another member of my class had been there dozens of times before me, I DEFINATELY would want them to get the item, even if the group/raid/guild policy is pure random.<P>I ask you, who NEEDS something more, the person who's gonna sell it to upgrade his or her equipment, the person who will use it RIGHT NOW to benifit the group, the person who will be able to use it in a few levels, someone making their fifth attempt at getting the item, or someone making their fiftieth atempt?<P>------------------<BR>The patchwork cleric<BR>Domus Divinae<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>/shrug, I'm not getting down on Dikmer for this situation, just explaining that it is not what NBG is.<P>NBG does heavily favor melee types, no doubt about it, but then again melee types are the only ones who really depend on gear to perform. Almost everything I have is no-drop stuff and/or stuff that nobody else could make use of, and I haven't noticed any degradation of performance because I don't have that next level of stuff. I will say however that of all the caster types, enchanters then clerics are the most dependent on gear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Gniss Fleshmender: "Yes, people abuse the NBG policy, but these people QUICKLY become well known for their actions."<P>I have to disagree strongly here. NBG abusers are hardly EVER caught. All it takes is one twink to pass items off to and you will never know who it was. Even if they decide to go to the auction place on your server (EC for many servers), chances are you nor anyone in your group will be there when that person does sell the item he got NBG. And even if he is, chances are you wont even remember his name. <P>The fact of the matter is, is after a person in a pick-up group gets an item, 99% of the time you will not know what he does with it after that session. <P>"I ask you, who NEEDS something more, the person who's gonna sell it to upgrade his or her equipment, the person who will use it RIGHT NOW to benifit the group,"<P>Well obviously your group handled the encounters thus far or you couldnt have got the item in the first place. Therefore no one NEEDS it. If a person that can use the item does, you are not going to be able to pull any faster, go to harder locations, gain more exps, etc. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, getting down on a guy for trying to get a leg up is pretty low IMO.  Flame me if you want, but I personally could care less.  I busted my butt to get a necro to lvl 55 and have to turn around and start all over again because my first class of choice didn't benefit the post 50 game.  I've seen the high level game and know that the gear isn't a luxury as it was pre-kunark as do many of you.  You all should be ashamed.  Don't tell me none of you have ever accepted an item by default only to take leave of it later in order to help yourself out.  Maybe you needed gems, or some nice rare piece of armor that has eluded you.  It doesn't matter what you did with it, it was YOURS.<P>Tell me I'm wrong and I'll call you a liar.  I see it every day.  Do I hold it against people who do this?  Nope.  Why?  Because what helps them will help me later on.  I'm glad that these friends of Dikmer's gave him the boots.  He stated plain as day he wasn't there with the intention to farm them.  So what if he sold them a few days later.  How would any of you like it if you were in his posistion wearing borrowed items?  You wouldn't, it's in our nature to be self-sufficient.<P>I'm sorry if I offend anyone with the truth.  Fact is, at the time, he did need them and his group obviously knew it.  If he had an opportunity to replace borrowed gear with them a few days later did they not serve the same purpose?  They paid for new gear that was his own so I think it evens out.  I'm sure his intent wasn't, yay, I'll get these boots by default and be filthy rich, muwhahah.  Grow up and stfu thx info.<P>It's nice to see that there are some people out there who care enough to help a friend.  His group knew that whether he kept them or not, he needed them, they weren't greedy.  That's what NBG is all about.  How much junk do you stash in your bank?  Most people don't care about selling stuff anymore, they just like to play.  Besides, it's much nicer to have something drop and you get it by default rather than having everything end up back in the lower guk situation. <P>Judging by all the negative feedback to this post I'd say that most of you are loot driven and that's just appalling.  Maybe we should just go back to the old ways and have casters win fbss's and tanks win smr's.  Maybe that will make some of you happy.  Farm away and be happy, then while you're at it, farm yourselves a clue.<P>/flame off<P>Krigor<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Dikmer,  I am very happy that you  were able to equip yourself.  If you had been in my group, I would have defaulted them to you also.<P><BR>I mostly play in Pick up groups.  Why?  I like meeting new ppl.  I like finding new friends.  And I have my lists of friends.  I know 85% of the ppl I have grouped with since I started playing eq a year and a half ago.  You people make me sick when you state that you don't remember your pick up groups.<P><BR>Guess what?  My "pick up Groups" are now my Friends.  They REMEMBER ME!!  They know what Items I have, they know how I play, The LIKE TO GROUP with me.   <P><BR>My cleric is getting her own friends too, and creating a reputation.  I don't need to mention Omegachu, Or Divar do I?  You remember him from Lguk, he farmed alot and trained alot if I am not mistaken.<P><BR>So where does that Leave NBG?  It leaves it in your lap.  You most likely will group with them again.  And if YOU don't remember, SOMEONE ELSE WILL.  Your reputation will follow, whether you want it to or not.  Not all of us convienently "forget" our pickup groups.   I have guild mates, and we group too.. but I don't have "set" times I play eq.  So my friends if they are on a schedule and play only durring "these" times.  I KNOW that.  I know what items they have won recently, (cause they tell me) and NBG works for me.<P><BR>My Bard, had not won ANYTHING in "lotto" before Kunark came out.  My cleric to date has won more then my bard.   I was given the drop of CSS (crystaline Short Sword) my first time in Seb,  The other tanks could have called a Lotto.  But they didn't.  They said I needed it.  I didn't even know what it was!!  I was using my Yaks, and I was happy with them.  <P><BR>Another point to make, the group was a Pick up group. All friends who had known Mohanna from other days grouping.  There were no arguements. No hard feelings. And no, I won't sell it either.  But DAMN did it feel GOOD getting a Drop after watching for 51 levels the other drops being Lottoed to someone else who would sell it. That in it self is priceless.  I will make sure that my friends get the drops they need.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><BR>YOU will never convince me that NBG is bad.

You people make me sick when you state that you don't remember your pick up groups."<P>You have GOT to be joking. Either that or you have some type of uber-memory. I've grouped with THOUSANDS of different characters throughout my career(s) doing pick-up groups. Im sorry that it makes you sick that i don't remember 1000+ players. Sure i remember some, especially those of the rarer type like halfling/gnome warriors/clerics, etc. But when you got people coming and going every hour, its impossible for me to keep track of who got what. <P>In just a single session in places like Seb or Karnors, i can group with 10 or more different players. And the next night i can group with 10 or more different players. Perhaps its because im in an older server, but i can easily group with 100 differnent players in a week of playing. Thats a hell of a lot of loot to remember who got what. In one crypt session a party can walk away with 7+ items. <P>"But DAMN did it feel GOOD getting a Drop after watching for 51 levels the other drops being Lottoed to someone else who would sell it."<P>I guess thats the difference between you and me. I feel good when anyone gets an opportunity to improve their character by winning a random. Whether they win an item they can start using immediately OR if they win an item they can trade for something they can use later on. <P>"YOU will never convince me that NBG is bad. Period."<P>YOU will never convince me that NBG is good. First, no one NEEDS the items, and second its NOT greedy wanting EVERYONE to have the same opportunity to improve their character.<P>Also, ill add that not supporting group-NBG does NOT mean you cant follow it personally.

But i will NOT deny others in the group a chance to improve their characters.

</FONT><HR>My two cents...<P>I must say that at 34, most MOBs that I hunt have one or two good drops, so when the good item comes up (say a Forest Loop or Icetooth Cloak) it is just one item and really only can be optimally used by one (or a few) classes.<P>So as a Dwarven Cleric, what is my incentive to join an Icetooth group?  Clearly I can't use the cloak (not only does it not have a wisdom or mana boost, but it is not equipable by dwarves).  Why would I (or any other cleric) ever join a pickup group fighting the frenzied ghoul or the ghoul lord?<P>If I am not with friends or guildmates, I cannot agree with NBG.  All of the good stuff needs to be randomly distributed based on a predetermined method.<P>Am I greedy?  Well, I don't have good items now.  A 20k value item could equip me quite well as it could anyone else in my current groups.  If I could use the item, would I sell it?  Probably not.  But would I help a camp of strangers if I was not going to have a shot at the good stuff?  Probably not.<P>And let's be reasonable.  Cheap stuff (20pp or less say) stuff should be on NBG.  Heck give the necro his words.<P>But the uber stuff is one of the things that attracts everyone to that MOB.  If the FBSS drops when I am in a pickup group, I am rolling.  <P>------------------<BR>Drusk Urdrom<BR>Level 29 Cleric<BR>Saryrn Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>Lets assume everyone was honest.  Clearly that's a false pretence to go on... but for the sake of argument, lets assume, that in any pickup group, you have honest people about what they "need".<P>NBG fails, because NBG is not practiced everywhere.  If NBG was universal, it would be better.  What I mean is...<P>Above you say you are in the FBSS group and would roll... to each thier own, but if NBG were going you would not get it unless everyone had one.  Then, you head off to camp something lese... let's say Donal's Gloves... the group says "We are /random 100 on everything... everyone is here working for it, everyone is rolling".  You lose the roll.<P>Here NBG worked great for that tank in the FBSS camp, but failed you miserably because this next group, where an item you could use is, did not follow NBG.<P>If NGB was everywhere... you entered a group and there was NO question, NO asshole asking to roll, then it would work... then you just have to work with people being honest...<P>... and not doing **** like "I'm the enchanter, I'm rolling on that gear I cannot use, because without me you would not be here".<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

I interpret it as based upon the item description, especially for pickup groups.  <P>If the item is only for a single class, e.g., Donal's armor, then only the members of the group in that class (clerics in this case) would roll for it, or if there's only one cleric, it passes by default, unless that person has one already, or something superior (my Thunder Etched Gauntlets are better than Donal's gloves, for instance).<P>If the item is for six or eight classes, covering every member of the group, it is lottoed to all, regardless of whether one might make better use of it than another (as is generally the case with warriors and weapons).  <P>Interpretations trickier than this lead to trouble, I've found, unless the NBG situation involves guild groups.  Remember, pickup groups are a bunch of strangers, and the groupmembers haven't much of a vested interest in making some fellow they just met richer or more powerful.  They will spend very little of their game time with those people, especially in the high end game.<P>Simple, easy to follow NBG rules work best among strangers in pickup groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>  Hopefully this thread gets read, since I have a question that directly relates to this.  I've been pondering doing pickup groups in Seb, to offset some finances, and to maybe pick up some stuff for my ranger friend.<P>  Now here's my question.  What if I join a group that decides its going to be class specific loot.  I need nothing from sebilis at all, but I could use stuff for my ranger.  What would the result be if I decided even though I was playing cleric, I'd give up all gems and spells that I'd normally get, and I'd like to be considered as a ranger for the trip?  If cleric loot drops, it can be randomed among everyone since nobody could use, but I'd like to roll on all the ranger usable items.<P>  What would the reaction be to this?  Obviously, this is an unfavorable thing for the other melees, but I'm helping the group get the items just as much as everyone else, and giving up my right to claim anything that would normally go to me as a cleric, which the group needs anyhow.<P>  Just wanted to throw this out, been discussing the idea with a couple people.  If anything it kind of makes the melee realize how much they benefit from the situation, and pushes it back to a straight random, in which everyone can benefit equally.<BR>  (I'm talking pickup groups only, not friends/guildmates, since obviously, thats a completely different situation)<P><BR>Just my .02<BR>Khalim Richelieu<BR>The Pantheon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>"Pointing out that I recieved an Item due to NBG, is not being greedy... I was using it as an example.. But if you want to get personal.. we can turn the tables.."<P>I did not get "personal" in my response any more or less than you did. Reread both of our responses and you should see that YOUR post were more "attacking" that mine were.<BR> <BR>"Had the CSS been /randomed, and knowing my "luck" on random rolls.. That sword would not be mine today.. Nor would the other items that were won by other players in our group. We all got something that day.."<P>If you all got something then everyone won a chance to improve their character. Who lost out? <P>"I am NOT a greedy player. I have given away more things then I can list or remember. Even with my UBER memory.."<P>Im didnt specifically say YOU were greedy. I said that NBG is a greed-driven process once you break it down.  <P>"It was my one time to shine, and you made it dirty.. Shame on you." <P>"This is a constructive disscussion on NBG and how you feel about it.. Not personal attacks towards others."<P>Lets me see, heres what YOU posted: "You people make me sick when you state that you don't remember your pick up groups."<P>Reading back, i was the only poster than brought of the point of how impossible it is to remember 1000 different characters. Therefore i took this as a direct attack against me. Even with that being said, i did not come out and make a direct attack against you, but instead attacked the NBG philosophy. <P>"Oh and I am on an old server, I just happen to remember people I meet. I meet around 3 to 9 new ppl a night.. The first time I meet them, I notice but wait to get to know them first. It's the following times that we group where they are added to my friends list. And YES I do have an uber memory! thank you." <P>Do you know your friends list can only hold 20 people right? A far cry short of the THOUSANDS of characters i've grouped with over the past 2 years. <P>"And YES I do have an uber memory! thank you." <P>Good for you. Im sorry people like me, with a normal memory "make you sick." Do you often insult people that do not have "uber" abilities like you? <P>Heres something to try the next time your in a NBG group. When someone gets an item on a NBG basis (other than yourself) and you start to get that warm fuzzy, look at the other 4 players in your group that didnt get crap. Then think of the items that drop in that area and deduce who in your group will get nothing. I DO think of those people. And i want them to have an opportunity to improve their characters through item acquisition. There is no greed motivation behind that. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/005941-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/005941.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/005941-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005941&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005941&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
