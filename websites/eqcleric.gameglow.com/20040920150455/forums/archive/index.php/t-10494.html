I am currently lvl 22.  So please don't flame me because I may say something wrong.<br />
     I kinda borrowed this technique from higher leveled people while they were hunting specs and such.  This technique is easy and really good at getting xp.<br />
     This happens in East Karana.  You'll need a ranger or a druid to pair up with, or in a group.  Have them go around tracking crag spiders and have them pull them.  I recommend pulling them to a point near the bottom of the ramp.<br />
     Have the ranger/druid Snare the crag. Not root it or any other variation, but Snare.  Its important. As the crag starts coming up to you while moving slowly, cast Fear on them.  They attempt to run and you bash away, Fearing every so often.  If you root it they'll attack you, but if snared at least they attampt to run.  Its kinda cheezy, but hey, it works.<br />
     I usually have Stun and Holy Might memmed, for if they at first resist Fear, you can stop them from dealing damage (and hopefully prevent from being poisoned).  Then Fear them again.  Easy exp.<br />
     Another thing I do with a group of 4 or more is hunt Broon the cyclops at the bottom of the ramp.  Just keep having the ranger/druid pull the crags, while waiting for Broon to spawn. It's alot of fun, fast xp, and relatively safe.  My group (a ranger, a wizard, a paladin, and myself) did this and I've gotten a bubble of xp within less than an hour.<br />
