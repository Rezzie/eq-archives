</FONT><HR>To answer the question in short: there is no way that the farming/item devaluation can ever be solved by verant by  rewriting the loot rules of the game, a.k.a. TLC. Another approach must be used.<P>Here's why:<P>In the real world, the economy works in accordance with the law of supply and demand. The price of any given product usually arrives at an equilibrium point, a naturally selected price for it, which is the highest price that the buyers are willing to pay and the lowest that the sellers will agree to sell at.<P>Now, keep in mind that in a real economy, the lowest price the sellers are willing to accept is determined mostly by the variable costs they incur - a combination of the price of raw materials used and/or labor used. The seller has a cutoff price-point below which he will not supply any more items to buyers because his costs exceed his profit and he will be netting a financial loss. In essence, Nike will not sell shoes for $5.00 a pair if it costs them $5.25 to make that pair of shoes; same applies to its competitors who will not undercut Nike prices too much for fear of losing money themselves. Such natural supply limits are what keeps the prices of products stable in any free-market economy.<P>Imagine the same economy, but with one variable set to zero - the variable, or product, cost. The seller can obtain the goods he sells at zero raw material cost to himself and no labor costs, as he doesn't have employees to pay wages to. With no cost to himself, no price he sells the product will be too low, because anything he charges is pure profit. In such a situation, the seller will supply as many items as he can sell, with no regard for the price dropping because he will never be at a loss. To return to the shoe analogy, Nike will be more than willing to sell the pair of shoes at $5.00 a pair if Adidas is selling at the same rice, especially since it cost both Adidas and Nike $0.00 to make the shoes in the first place.<P>The first example is the real-world economy; the second, the EQ player-run economy. The lack of variable cost (and fixed cost, though I've omitted it in my explanation for simplicity's sake) means that there is no check on the amount of goods supplied to the economy, and is the reason for the rampant inflation of item prices. After all, a high-level player farming items for sale invests nothing, no raw materials and no labor costs as he does the camping himself.<P>Is there a way to fix it? Yes, there is one way that I can see to fix the item inflation/farming problem, and that is to introduce real cost to obtaining each item. A way needs to be found to attach real financial cost to obtaining any item in the game, otherwise it will quickly become very cheap.<P>One example of this system in place are the crafted armor quests - the gems for the armor cost a certain amount, and the armor prices tend to remain on a certain level matching those gems, so that those who have done the quest do not incur a financial loss. The fact that many of the crafted pieces can be bought cheaper than the gems required for the quest discourages people from doing the quests - naturally limiting the supply of those items into the economy. Eventually, with fewer and fewer people doing the quests the amount of crafted armor pieces in the game will decrease to the point where ther price rises and the quests become worth doing again, again restoring the influx of them into the economy and keeping the price at an equilibrium.<P>Such a mechanism needs to be implemented into the item drops in the game. The change would be simple - make each item dropped a quest, with two components - a dropped item and a cash amount in either common gems (like rubies, sapphires) or simply pp (as in the Journeyman's Boots quest).  The dropped component would need to be NO DROP, like the crafted armor components, so it won't ge sold on its own at no cost to whoever is selling it.<P>I suspect that Verant has not implemented such a system as we have in place because they wanted the players to "work" for their items as opposed to buying them in a store; they made them monster-dropped. This would keep that idea intact as the quest piece will still need to be looted from the mob (and thus worked for). It would also stabilize the economy by keeping the price of items high since nobody, not even high level players, would farm the quest pieces and turn them in with rubies/pp for items to be sold for less than what it cost to obtain them.<P>How is this good?<BR>- Twinking for the high level characters, and therefore their "reward" for being high level, remains intact as they would be able to camp the quest piece/pay the pp OR buy the item on an open market for a comparable sum.<BR>- The rampant camping would be eliminated. This may sound miraculous, but once all those who can afford the item at its market cost have the item, the usual EQ mechanism - a continuous supply of items forcing a drop in their price - would not work now, because if the price drops below the cost of the quest it wouldn't make economic sense for people to farm items at a loss.<BR>- People of the appropriate level could still do their fighting and attain items; they wouldn't be camped 24/7, since after a while increasing supply with a demand at a certain price saturated would yield a lower price and make farming un-economical. New items would, of course, be camped for a few weeks after their release until their price drops to the eqilibrium level.<P>As I see it, introducing real variable costs to obtaining items would satisfy both sides here: mainly, it would eliminate item farming as a way to get rich, since after a while there wouldn't be people to sell the items to, and lowering the price to broaden the market wouldn't be possible as it would result in farming netting a financial loss. Case in the point: crafted armor quests. Still sold, price staying solid, not many farmers on the pieces since the market for them is saturated and lowering the price on items would mean losing money.<P>Furthermore, it would still allow high level players to twink their alts, albeit not as cheaply, and it would eliminate the rapid devaluation of EQ items.<P>What is required is for Verant to implement those quests and set prices for the items in the economy. The player economy would still remain intact: not everyone wants to spend the time camping the quest pieces, even though it would be possible, the way not everyone in a real economy would want to produce their toothbrush when it's easier to buy it. The quest items, as mentioned before, would have to be NO DROP as to necessitate spending the money for the quest before obtaining items - otherwise the quest pieces would simply replace items themselves in trade.<P>That's about it for my suggestion on how to cure the EQ player-run economy. Look at the real world, look at EQ, see what's missing in EQ from the real world and implement it, then let the law of supply and demand take its course.<P>Any thoughts?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>But there is a labour cost in obtaining the item... your time spent camping to get it.<P>Granted if you were doing an xp camp and got an item that time cost would be minimal, but if it was a greenie camp and you were there for a specific item, that's all time at your expense which could have been used doing something else more productive than slaughtering greenies.<P>The problem with the eq economy is in the supply/demand portion.  The supply consistently exceeds demand as the only ways an item leaves the economy is when an account is cancelled, or when it is deleted or on a lost corpse.<P>Since most accounts probably have a lifespan of over 1 year, lost corpses are rare, and people most likely won't destroy a giveable item that they invested either time or pp into(it'll either be passed down to a friend, or sold back into the market), very few items leave the economy once they enter it.  That's the problem.<P>The solution of course would be to introduce item decay, or to slow the supply even more :P  Neither of which are really all that viable.  The first because of the code changes it'd require, and the second because everyone would scream nerf and cancel accounts :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You can't just look at it from an economic standpoint...there is also the "realistic" approach. A (humanoid) monster drops a sword, I should be able to pick it up and use it (well, if I was playing a warrior at least). A human bandit drops a bit of leather armor, I should be able to wear it if I'm human sized.<P>I don't think your method makes EQ more like the real world economically, and it would detract a lot of "immersion value" to the game.<P>One thing I WOULD like is some sort of supply/demand code in merchants. If every merchant in town has fine steel swords in stock, the price of them should plummet. The degree of pricing influence a merchant has upon another should depend on how far apart they are spaced, zonewise. A merchant in North Freeport might influence one in West Freeport a lot, while (practically) not influencing a merchant in Kael Drakkal at all.<P>There would probably have to be some decay of items in stock, or the prices of most common items would stay at 1 copper. :-)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

You need to consider the need in capitalist societies for every company (at least those owned by public shareholders) to make the most profit possible.  This provides pressure to raise prices.<P>Pressures to lower prices include competition, government regulation, customer abilities to purchase.  Under competition, we should include alternatives available that aren't exactly the same, but serve many of the same functions.  There's also a pressure to reduce prices to avoid maintaining inventory (which may be taxed, and in any case, ties up capital invested, and costs to protect, etc.)  It can be better for a company to take a one time loss (especially if there's a tax write off) than to incur continuing losses and keep capital tied up.<P>Nike, your example, makes a MASSIVE profit off its shoes, such a large profit as to make labor costs, for example, nearly negligible.  It can do so because the pressures from competition and the public willingness/ability to buy it's products are in line.<P>Now, eq economy:  pressures to raise prices include player perceptions of time investment, desire to get plat, etc.<P>pressures to lower prices: increasing availability of alternative items, player perceptions/dislike about spending time in marketing zones, dislike of having bank slots taken up by stuff one doesn't use... AND player level and ability to obtain equal/other items themselves (or have items passed along by generous guildmates).<P>Result: prices of older items have dropped on mature servers, UNLESS the item is desired by higher level players who prefer to pay rather than spend time getting something.  (I'm betting leather padding goes for more now than a year ago on most mature servers because higher level players are skilling up for cultural smithing.)  On my server, many lower level chars are twinks, outfitted in stuff from friends who've moved on from, say, quest armor to velious or kunark armors.<P>To be honest, the economy isn't broken in any way, but rather working in very predictable ways.  Your issue is that things you want to make a large profit from (or want to resell for what you paid ages ago) won't make the profit you want.  That's not a broken economy, but broken expectations about the economy.<P>Expect deflation in an eq economy except for items higher level chars want and don't want to get themselves, and you'll probably be right.<P>/salute, Hende</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The problem with the EQ economy is not that there is no cost to obtain items. As someone pointed out, there is a labor cost. <P>The problem is that in a real world ecomony, it functions on the basis of supply and demand of SCARCE resources. In EQ items that enterthe economy stay in the economy forever. Eventually, every item in th game becomes common, thus it's price drops. Items that drop more rarely still lose value because of this, they just lose it more slowly, because they become common more slowly. <P>Item value decays for a particular person because as theyincrease in level, they need better and better equipement. However, the items that they used before can still be passed on to lower level characers for whom the item is still acceptable, or even highly desired. Unless real item decay is introduced, the player run economy in EQ will continue to deteriorate. Already on older servers, many items that once command high prices are sold to merchants. Most trade skill items that could once turn a profit for the maker are useless junk. Try to sell a banded tunic when people are selling better dropped items for less. It's impossible. <P>These days, level 30 characters, NON-twinked, can easily purchase armor and weapons better than those used by many level 50 characters before Kunark came out. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I generally agree with what everyone else has saying.  The solution you offered would just raise the floor price of items.<P>As others said, there is a cost to farming, lost exp, yes it might be a personal cost but also think of this.<BR>I can go to seb and depending on what camp I'm at and how good my group is, it is possible for me to make a good bit of plat off of gems and other items without getting any special drops that I sell to players.  On one lucky day I got a Blue Diamond, diamond (which I got made into resist gear saving me probably oh about 8k) plus 2k in other gems and such in roughly 4 hours or so.  Now admittedly, this was an uncharastic day, I've done the same camp, wiht the same pull rate (roughly) for about the same time and walked out with 300pp worth of gems, and nothing else.  And considering I spent probably about 150pp in peridots it wasn't a good day, but still profitable.<BR>And of course the whole time I was getting exp too.<P>Now the main problem with the EQ economy that causes deflation (as mentioned at least twice previously) is there is no actual consumption.  Yes goods are bought and used, but never suffer any wear, so they can be resold repeatedly.  Yes some items are lost, destroyed, sold to merchants, etc. and yes the server population increases, but even with these two other forces, the supply grows disproportionately to the demand.  Because there is a greater supply then demand, there is a scramble by sellers to unload items, and a lower interest in the buying population so the price must decrease.<P>Thankfully, through expansions, new zones, new quests, etc. new items are constantly introduced into the game.  And the novelty of a new item (provided it is comprable to present items)raises the price.  So even if by the time you are high enough to farm the TBB it is worth 300pp, there will be another item you can farm worth 5k.  That is as long as Verrant keeps adding items in the same manner they have been.<P>As far as I'm concerned the economy works fine.  In all honestly I'd rather be constantly poor because I don't farm and have bad luck on lottos, then fairly well off but have to constantly spend my plat to requip my gear as it decays.<P>There is no need to "fix" the economy.  It works.  Yes some players have the best gear and 30k plat and some players have good enough gear to get by and 300pp, but that is how it will always be.  Look at the real world, is everyone equal finacially in a capitalist, or even a socialized economy?  Nope.  <P>I'm broke, I currently have 500pp in the bank, 300 or so of that from my guild to finance peridots for raids.  My gear isn't bad, not great for 53, but not awful either.  But I don't farm, I barely have the time to play at all, and I don't roll on drops unless a) no one else needs it all or b) it's a cleric usable item that I need and I'm not on a guild raid.<BR>I come across vellious quest gems a good bit, but those all go to the guild.  I could sell the ones I got when just grinding since it was not a guild event, but the guild bought me my gems out of the fund when I needed some so I think I should give them whatever quest gems I come across.  Not everyone sees it that way, but there is no guild rule so oh well.<P>So the only way I generally make plat is by drops sold to merchants, selling my old gear if no one I know needs it, or the very rare drop I win in a lotto that no one else in the group needs.<P>So in other words, I barely ever make plat.  But that is okay cause almost any piece of gear I could use would probably cost me 5k minimum, and I don't have the time to farm and make even that much plat, so it's easier for me to just hunt where the stuff drops.  If my memory is right the only zones I haven't hunted in are PoM, Veeshan's Peak, and sleepers tomb, so I can get most stuff I need with a lot of luck.<P>Oh well I doubt anyone is still reading, and if you are you must have been even more bored then I was when I typed it.<P>Kaharz Strongarm<BR>53rd lvl Vicar of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Forsaken<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007363&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007363&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
