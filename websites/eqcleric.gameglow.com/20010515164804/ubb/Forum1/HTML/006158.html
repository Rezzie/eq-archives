</FONT><HR>Posted this in the developer's corner.  Hope they read and respond to it.<P>Greetings!<P>I'd like to submit some comments regarding the cleric epic quest item.<P>First, a list of significant encounters needed to obtain the epic item:<P>1) A tussle with Lord Bergurgle.  Not exceptionally difficult, but he is a rare spawn with a long timer.  Clerics frequently spend dozens of hours at this camp.<P>2) A fight with a Plasmatic Priest- significant enough to demand a minimum of a full group of 50+ characters.  A rapid enough respawn time to make the wait negligable.<P>3) An attack on Ixiblat Fer- Ixiblat is a true epic mob, far more powerful than any pre-buffed God.  Taking him down will require several groups of 50+ characters all working together.  Ixiblat is a triggered spawn.<P>4) Fighting lord Gimblox- A trivial battle for anyone that could reasonably get the epic.  But Gimblox is a rare spawn on a medium length timer.  Again, a long wait is usually in order.<P>5) Fighting the overking of Chardok-By far the most difficult encounter.  Several groups of 55+ adventurers must be along to fight this monstrosity.  On top of this, the overking is guarded by many guards that by themselves are extremely powerful.  A VERY difficult and challenging encounter.  There is a two hour respawn on the King, but it doesn't really matter, since the sheer manpower and skill needed for this encounter requires far more than two hours to plan.<P>6) Finally, killing Ragefire- Almost a let down compared to the overking, you must fight two succesive spawns of 55th level monsters.  Still somewhat challenging to all but the most powerful groups.<P>The spawn time of the 6th encounter is what I would like to talk about.  Presently, Ragefire is on an extremely random and extremely long (72 hour) spawn timer.  Moreover, he cannot spawn while Nagafen is present, making him even more rare.  The result of this is that clerics (and their guilds) have no choice but to employ silly tactics like leaving a monk permanently feigned in the Fire Giant area, waiting for the pop.<P>Even worse, there are many clerics waiting for ragefire, which means that once he spawns, there is a race for the spawn.  Such races inevitably lead to bad blood and feuding between clerics (and guilds!).  A situation like this only promotes aggravation, ill-will, immaturity, greed, and a slew of other undesirable results.<P>Is it really necessary to limit the number of water sprinklers in such a confrontational manner?  I would hypothesize that at least two of the previous encounters serve as excellent "weeding-out" tests.  Only the most skillful and most respected clerics would be capable of marshalling a force powerful enough to kill Ixiblat and the overking.  And yet the final encounter is so frustratingly rare that these elite few are forced to wind up bickering with one another, when it's fairly obvious that they all deserve the weapon.<P>I'd ask that you review the ragefire spawn.  By all means, make it more difficult- promote ragefire to 60th+ level.  Give him powerful guards.  Do anything to assure that only worthy clerics are able to defeat him.  But make him more common, more predictable.  He doesn't have to be a triggered spawn.  Why not put him on a twelve hour timer?  Making him more powerful but somewhat more frequent would have very much the same effect on rarity of the water sprinkler, but with far less aggravation than the spawn causes now.<P>Thanks for the attention.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You'd have to be in an uber guild to kill a level 60 dragon. My guild even had issues with him as a level 54 dragon... <P>They just need to decrease the damn spawn timer a bit. Make him spawn more eh. <P>If they make him difficult, that leaves everyone out who isn't in a guild of 100 55+ players. It would be all but impossible for a guild like my own to fight and kill Ragefire if he were level 60.<P>------------------<BR>Georgia Gaelicmyst<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Everlore Staff Member<BR>http://www.everlore.com/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>OOC.<BR>I see the current situation of non-triggered spawns and huge waiting times (and races) as bad planning by Verant, and like everyone can only see common sense in increasing the spawn rate and/or making a triggered Ragefire spawn, as has been done for other epic quests with this problem.<P>However, I agree with Georgia completely. This is a game for everyone, not just hardcore uberguild players. Wanting to make him so difficult that regardless of the skill of the cleric, you have to have 30+ people with uber-equipped 55+ characters to kill him is simply a ludicrous suggestion, that supports one playstyle and punishes the others. Moving him to a place where only the massively powerful guilds can go is similar (yes I know some other epics force this, but why even suggest making the cleric one far harder than it is, unless it is for the selfish reasons?).<P>A less selfish suggestion is to make him a triggered spawn as well as the current way of spawning him, with the triggered version maybe 2-3 levels higher, but with the benefit of less waiting.<P>Felishanna Secretlight<BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Heroes of the Old Lands (www.flare.de)<BR>Lanys T'Vyl.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I guess it's all in our definition of uber then.  It is a subjective term.  To me, a guild with 10 epics is uber.  If that makes me a noob, so be it.  I'm not on an uberguild server, so I know little of such things.<P>I'd like to examine once again the issue of some players being excluded from ever getting their epic.<P>Let's look at step one of the epic quest.<P>"1)  A tussle with Lord Bergurgle. Not exceptionally difficult, but he is a rare spawn with a long timer. Clerics frequently spend dozens of hours at this camp."<P>OK, rare spawn with a long timer.<P>Step 1 assures that only the clerics with hours of time to dedicate to camping a spawn will ever complete it.<P>What if I said that this is unfair to the players who do not have hours on end to play a video game?<P>To me, this is the same type of complaint as, "This is unfair to those of us who do not have an uberguild to back us up."<P>Do you feel for those clerics that cannot complete Step 1?  I don't.<P>Now, on to Step 3.<P>"3) An attack on Ixiblat Fer- Ixiblat is a true epic mob, far more powerful than any pre-buffed God. Taking him down will require several groups of 50+ characters all working together. Ixiblat is a triggered spawn."<P>This is not fair to those of us who are guildless!  What if I have no friends in EQ?  What if everyone hates me?  I'll never get past Step 3.<P>Do you feel for the clerics who will never have the chance to complete Step 3?  I don't.<P>Your complaints revolve around the supposed fact that you must be in an uberguild to complete the quest.  (Then you say your guild has 2 cleric epics, but it's not an uberguild.   /boggle )<P>How are the complaints I've outlined above less valid than yours?<P>Do you believe that if a cleric has no friends in EQ, that he/she does not deserve the epic weapon?<P>The only issue I see being brought to light is this problem with the last part of the quest.  What about the previous steps of the quest that also serve to alientate many clerics?  Is this fair?  I think it's fair.<P>If you believe that those previous steps are fair to everyone, then I don't see how you can have a problem with the last step requiring an uberguild to complete.<P>I believe that you're not complaining about the previous steps because, FOR YOU, they were doable.  But, alas, you are in an uberguild.  Just apparently not uber enough to farm epic weapons for your clerics.  And I think that is fair, too.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Uber guilds will crush people who are in smaller guilds and haven't cleared Veeshan's Peak. Uber guilds will race from spawn to spawn on patch days just because they can.

</FONT><HR>I'm going to dodge the whole "who deserves to get an epic" issue since it's obviously something that Verant determines.  However, I see two major issues with the epics in general and ours specifically:<P>1) The difficulty of the epics for the various classes is incredibly disparate and frankly that is just not fair.<P>2) Our epic is too damned easy to get to the last step, and if it wouldn't be for the incredible amount of Clerics waiting to complete the entire quest would be a breeze.<P>Comments on #1:<BR>Some classes have a very easy (relatively speaking) epic to complete compared to others.  I think most can agree that Rogues and Shamans go to the top of the ease list with Wizards and Mages at the bottom.  I don't understand how Verant can create quests where a Mage has to get to Isle 7 in Sky to get a final item whereas a Rogue merely has to kill a mob in Kithicor, but what's new right?  The Shaman quest's final mob can be duo'd by a Mage and a Cleric (I know because we did it).  Wizards not only have to be in a good guild to kill VS, but in addition have to be online when the servers come up since the half-life on Venril Sathir is around 15 minutes from spawn, so tough crap if you have a normal job on the West coast.  My problem with the quests in general is VS is just full of it when they say the quests are meant to be "epic."  There should be absolute parity and currently there is nothing near it.<P>Comments on #2:<BR>I think we need to be honest and admit except for the final bottleneck the Cleric quest is damned easy.  It's boring, it takes time, but it's easy.  Bergurgle, Shmendrick and the Lava Elemental can be easily duo'd, the Plasmatic Priest is a cinch to do with a Trio (Shaman/Cleric/melee) and the Overking is easy for two good 55+ groups (he is, really).  Ixiblat can be tough, no question about it, but he's still doable and many many Clerics get there sceptres during an "Ixi Party."<P>So with the quest being too easy what happens is we get an incredible number of Clerics getting to the Ragefire point.  Since we have so many Clerics reaching this point, and only 2-3 per server per week getting completed (that's when there aren't server downs) we have an increasingly growing number of frustrated Clerics.  It definitely sucks to be at the final stage of a quest along with 50+ other people on your server.  And to make matters worse the problem is increasing since I'd bet that more Clerics are getting to the bottleneck each week than Clerics completing the quest.<P>I wrote Absor a few weeks ago (I'm sure he just deleted, he never responded) outlining some problems (KSing, conflict, bottleneck, etc) along with some suggested solutions:<P>1) Make Plasmatic Priest much harder.  For example, level 60 and totally MR would be a start.<P>2) Make Overking harder.<P>3) Make Ixiblat harder.<P>4) Make epic effect only work at 56+.  Since I've heard that effects can only be set at 50, then make it so the quest givers only talk to 55+ Clerics.  Sorry for all you lower level Clerics, but my feeling is you should be able to cast the spell before you can use the effect.  Go level up a bit.<P>5) Leave Ragefire where he is, but add a triggerable mob (ala Feydedar) that is low 60s and requires 4-5 good groups to kill.  This allows the weaker guilds a chance to get an easy Ragefire while the stronger guilds can go after the triggered mob.  Put the trigger mob on a 12/24 hour timer.<P>Frankly I'd love to see Verant really retune all of the quests to achieve parity, but I have little hope they will do it.<P>Rayne<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

No other quest has an unPHed mob like this with a 100% drop rate (at least before they made the Queen have 100% drops which they needed to since she is 10x harder than the king.). 30-50% drop rate would be fine really.

Go level up a bit.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>Honestly, if they make the quest harder you're more than welcome to the 56 res before 56. Keep in mind that we look like hypocrites if we make a stink about people demanding 56 reses over 49 and then say that the 56 res is too good for a 50-55 cleric to have.

Put the trigger mob on a 12/24 hour timer.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Uhm... what about Nagafen? That's still my biggest problem, really. Naggy is still level capped.

</FONT><HR>I think one of the primary goals of the Epic quests is to create time sinks. Verrant loves time sinks. It could be killing greeny placeholders to get the spawn mob, sitting for 20 minutes waiting for the boat, having to run through 3 zones to get to your destination, tracking down some rare mob for a key piece... anything but leveling up and reaching the "end game". Although actually, the more I think about it, I wonder who is more likely to cancel their account: a level 50 with 60 days /played or a level 50 twink with 10 days /played?<P>I know they intially underestimated how many hours people were willing to put into this game.

</FONT><HR>People are saying you should not be able to use the epic weapon untill 56+. Althouh this would limit a small amount of people doing the epic quest, do you think its a level 55 and below clerics fault Verant named the effect the same name as the spell we get at 56? What if it was still a 96% res but had a new name that no other spell had. Would people still be saying this? No. Sorry it just doesnt seem right, I got my epic at level 54, just because the effect was named the same thing as a spell other clerics cant use till 56+ shouldnt mean I am not worthy of it.<BR>   The mage epic pet is more powerful than a lvl 60 mages pet. For the mage epic is a lvl 46 spell, should a level 60 magician with no epic be slightly jelous of lets say a 55 mage with epic? Probably, but the mage deserved it because he/she completed the quest to have it. <BR>This post is not aimed directly at anyone, its just i have seen a lot of posts about this. Just wanted to state my thoughts. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well Boanerges,<P>I don't think it matters if we agree on how to fix the issue.  While I appreciate the issue you've raised frequently, that is, the fact that Ragefire is dependent upon the level capped Nagafen, I'm more interested in how to alleviate the Ragefire bottleneck.<P>As I alluded to earlier I think the bottleneck is caused by two issues:<P>1) An increasing number of Clerics reaching the bottleneck;<BR>2) The rarity of the spawn.<P>So, my feeling is Verant should take some steps to reduce the number of Clerics reaching the bottleneck while also giving us more chances at Ragefire.  By giving us a much tougher, triggerable Ragefire in addition to the one that currently exists the needs of both small and large guilds are met.  And by reducing the number of Clerics able to reach the bottleneck we (hopefully) wouldn't have that great an increase in the number of Cleric epics (er, after the intial backlog was depleted).  Verant will be interested in keeping the numbers down.<P>As for making the encounters tougher as I suggested, well, I would rather tougher encounters than longer spawns (Verant's favorite method of dealing with Cleric quests).  When I play I look for an adventure, and I don't consider looking at the walls or killing greenies for hours at a time an adventure.<P>It doesn't matter much anyway; we're just flapping our gums for entertainment here =).<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006158&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006158&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
