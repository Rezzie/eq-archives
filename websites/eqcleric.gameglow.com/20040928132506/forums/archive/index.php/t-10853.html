<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-29-2001, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been trying to break Tormax's lair.  We don't have the strength to kill Tormax in guild, but do have the strength to kill the other mobs, er, provided we get them single.  We could probably do a duo (have done a few), but the Sentinels are rather painful with two groups.<br />
<br />
So, we split the first two Sents easily (Monk aggros, I aggro the 2nd Sentinel with the SK, we both feign after the original Sentinel has been handed off).  The next three are then single puills.<br />
<br />
That leaves us with Kyenka and his two pets on the left, and Ytarr and his two pets on the right.  One time we managed to get just Ytarr and one Sentinel (the Monk then promptly dumped them on Rayne's head -- fun fight with the Cleric dead), but out of obstinancy have been concentrating on splitting Kyenka and his two guards.<br />
<br />
Here's what we've tried and failed at:<br />
<br />
-&gt; Dispelling Kyenka after pulling past the bridge.  Ideally Kyenka would stop to rebuff while his guards went home.  What actually happens is Kyenka's guards stay put while he rebuffs.  So scratch that.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Snaring Kyenka and then feining.  Same deal.  They sit tight with Kyenka until the darkness wears off.  Just a note: the easy way to feign split Velious mobs is have an SK cast Dooming Darkness (the lower level snares don't seem to work) and then feign.  The other mobs return while the feign mob just stands there.  Regardless, doesn't work on Kyenka.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Having a tank hold up the guards in the TR while we pull Kyenka.  Could work, but the 57 Warrior aggro'd Tormax.  Was ugly.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Variations on picking a mob out of the pack.<br />
<br />
Now the only thing we haven't really tried is snaring a guard and feigning (got late).  I'm hoping that the guard will stick and Kyenka isn't so loyal.  But I have my doubts.<br />
<br />
We're considering some fancy tricks to Root/Snare his guards and kite them a little bit while we kill Kyenka (is what was suggested by people who kill Vindicator), but not sure how we'll it'll work.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions beyond the brute force technique?  I'm sure we could gather a force big enough to deal with three at once, but that doesn't seem like fun.<br />

<br />
(not to be confused with the sentinel standing next to him, he's his own mob - the 2 guards are up behind tormax's area when kyenka has not been aggroed since server up)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-30-2001, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you doubt that I could split a guard (pet) off Kyenka?<br />
<br />
In that case I suspect we could &quot;kite&quot; the guards using snares and feign.<br />

Dartanian went in and Malo'd Kyenka (died -- too slow on Evac), Malosini'd (died -- too slow on Evac), and I was able to snare him fine.  Just didn't do crap.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm now leaning toward dispelling the crap out of Kyenka's guards and kiting them (aggro insanely, feign, wait, stand up, feign, wait, repeat for 3 minutes =P) while we kill Kyenka.  Or dispelling the crap out of Kyenka and a guard and kite them while killing a guard.<br />
<br />
One way or another we WILL split that damned room.  <br />
<br />
Twelve people is the way to do stuff if you ask me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">05-30-2001, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, we basicly gave up attempting to split them. We just go in wtih 4 groups and KEEL all 3 at the same time. Even with 4 groups, its still a brutal fight to have a MOB that flurries and quads for 490 and also have 2 others that hit for over 300 or whatever.<br />
Once those are all gone, its actually rather easy to split Tormax's guards off him and leave Tormax all alone in his room waiting to die. Soon we will smack Tormax. Not quite yet though considdering the statue of rollos zek squashed us flatter than a flat thing that wone awards for flatness from the flat people of flat world.  =)<br />
I'm more concerned with pillaging the Testing Halls in ToV for all they are worth atm though. Its getting kinda crowded in there. =/<br />

<br />
As a guildmate of Skrim's, I've been working on this one too. I think I've got a plan that will work, but it will take a 13th person.<br />
<br />
All the MOB's named above have a quest. That means that when hail'ed by a non-KoS, tehy should stop and chat. So, all you need to do is this:<br />
<br />
Pull the three to the end of the Ice bridge using normal FP techniques.<br />
Have the non-KoS person hail the NPC.<br />
Wait for the other NPC's to return to spawn points.<br />
Pull the single.<br />
<br />
Now, a MOB doesn't need to have a quest for this to work. Many SS MOB's without quests will respond to hails with a single chatty line. That's all you need for them to stop.<br />
<br />
They might not stop if you aren't indiff or better. I kinda remember something about that in the back of my head. I know Yelinak (dubious) won't turn to face me when hailed, so I don't think the put-off comments will stop the NPC. But every other NPC in SS with a chatty response will turn to me, and that means they would stop.<br />
<br />
I don't know when we'll get to try this out ourselves. Hopefully, we'll go next week.<br />

   Just a suggestion here have you tried having a break team head up there and do the following.<br />
<br />
Have a Magician, 2 x Chanter, Puller with FD, 2 x cleric.<br />
<br />
The magician mallosi them this will agro them the clerics root the two pets, or chanters Mez them then root them have the puller intercept the target coming in to the magician.<br />
The cleric then try to atone and the chanters try to memory blur the guards and the pull in the meantime drags the main kill back to the pack to kill once atoned/memory wiped the rest of the group head back.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that works but many people forget lines of spells like memory blur/atone and also the lull line that may also work?<br />

<br />
Giants can't be mezed.<br />
Roots won't stick.<br />
The mage would die nearly instantly.<br />
<br />
 The cleric then try to atone and the chanters try to memory blur the guards and the pull in the meantime drags the main kill back to the pack to kill once atoned/memory wiped the rest of the group head back.<br />
<br />
Atone/mem blure won't take on high level giants.<br />
<br />
 I don't know if that works but many people forget lines of spells like memory blur/atone and also the lull line that may also work?<br />
<br />
Nazrin<br />
<br />
We havn't forgotten the spell lines, we just never mem them vs high level SoV stuff because the MOBs are immune by design.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaldarith</div><div class="date">06-03-2001, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was actually watching somebody do this for like 4 hours the other day in Kael, it was kind of fun to watch, but I could really tell they were frustrated.<br />
<br />
Seems that if you find a 60 Enchanter with Dictate, and you sacrifice a Magician/Shaman and an Enchanter (Tash+Malo, etc.), you can have the 60 Enchanter charm Kyenka's pet.<br />
<br />
The sentinel is now yours to control.<br />
<br />
I know that the one giant behind the questers that guards Kelorek Dek`Torek (Forget his name) used to be charmable, until Fires of Heaven kicked Verant in the balls, and Verant nerfed that giant so he couldn't be charmable.<br />
<br />
Since Kyneka's pet is only level 56-57, Dictate should hold, provided you get enough MR debuffs in there.  I saw some people do it on Xegony (unless I was just hallucinating).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately though, I'm probably 5 months away, from even trying Velious uber mobs with my own guild.  I've done raids with other guilds, but nothing compared to Tormax, Dain, or Yelinak.<br />
<br />
Good luck Rayne  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  If dictate+malo+tash+occulusion of sound doesn't work, smack me!  k!<br />
