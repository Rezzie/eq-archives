<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is due to the tremendous success of Diablo2.com.  Luckily for the GameGlow they host Diablo2.com.  Unluckily for us they host Diablo2.com.  As you can well imagine that site is getting a ton of traffic and that is directly impacting this site.<br />
<br />
The good news is they are working on a solution for it ASAP.  The bad news is ASAP in this particular case might mean as much as a few weeks.  I have delivered my thoughts on this subject.  Provided said e-mail does not cause this site to be closed down immediately I expect things to improve before July is over or I move, again.  I really don't want to move; they have been good to work with and it's a hassle, but when it takes 45+ seconds to get this &quot;Post New Topic&quot; page to load I take notice.<br />
<br />
