</FONT><HR>Scenario A: The word goes out in /guildsay that Ragefire is up.  Ten level 60s mobilize quickly (15 min) and start killing FGs.  In the meantime a level 30 Druid is camped nearby claiming he was camping Ragefire for his Cleric and his guild is mobilizing.  The level 60s arrive first ready to spawn and kill Ragefire.  The camper's guild has a few people trickled in by now, but admittedly does not have the force to do the deed, so resorts to claiming the camp in /OOC and /Shout.  Who has the right to spawn Ragefire?<P>Scenario B (and C, D, etc):  One group/guild is "camping" Ragefire, but is not ready to fight when another guild arrives ready to proceed.  Who gets to spawn Ragefire?  If you said the "campers," how long are the recent arrivals obligated to wait in your opinion before they are justified in proceeding?  Thirty minutes? An hour? Two hours?  A day?<P>I'm curious what people think.<P>Keep it civil, there are bound to be disagreements =).<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well, in scenario A, yes the druid has spent that time camping him... but the druid can't kill Ragefire. The druid can't even spawn Ragefire. The reason he's down there is to let people know when he's up to go kill him.<P>Like it or not, you can't camp one major spawn like that and "claim" it. Just like a group at the zone of Sebilis can't "claim" a camp. Otherwise you could just park 1 person anywhere in the world and just start claiming stuff left and right. <P>In B (C, D, etc) you've got a more sticky situation. You can't just do the noble thing and say "we'll take the next one". You can't guarantee that. Even a GM or guide can't guarantee that. Someone is going to have to lose out, plain and simple. Randoms are nice but some people just cannot win a random to save their life (I watched a GL lose EVERY random he ever participated in). I've even watched other people just run in and hand it in over other people who were there.<P>There are no "good" solutions here. Unlike the gods, you can't plan for Ragefire, you must camp him. And unless you have a guild willing to sit down there or can mobilize faster than anyone it's pretty much pointless to even start your quest now.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>This is my personal opinion.<P>Scenario A is bogus.  Again my opinion, but using some alt that's way too low a level and claiming "camping" is wrong.  Be it some 30th lvl druid, or some lowish lvl monk or whatever.  I just personally don't buy that at all.  I especially don't by it if Fire giants are up.  FG's should be dead on spawn if somebody is "camping" ragefire.<P>Scenario B is a bit tougher.  If there is a group capable of killing FGs, which now adays can be done with a pretty small number of people, but lets say it's 1 group.  If the cleric is there with them, again another thing about me is somebody else doesn't camp something for you, then I personally would say that they were camping ragefire.  The tough part is how long to give that person to get the forces required to kill him.  I suppose personally I would inquire to the person how long they thought it would be before the help came.  I don't know that I would have any set amount of time I'd give them.  But personally, if they spent X amount of time, clearing fire giants and waiting for him to spawn, to me, it gives them alot more rights to it then people that just show up, after it spawns, with the required forces to do it.  Again, that's just me.  But the important difference from A to B to me is that the cleric must be present, and the group should be clearing the FG's as they spawn.  <P>*shrug*<P>We've had some problems on my server with people trying to do something like scenario A.  Personally, I'm very glad that I got mine when I did, back when overking was tough and there wasn't very many people at the zordak stage.  People would just kill FGs if they were up, and if they found Zordak, you killed him.<P>Dalain<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Scenario A is not bogus; been in SolB several times when a mid-levels character claimed the Ragefire camp.<P>And since people seemed to have such strong feelings about what was right and wrong, I'm curious to see if they can put a time limit on how long to give someone to get a group together.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think in both cases the person who has actually been waiting for Ragefire should get it. And in a perfect world, other guilds which are ready to proceed would offer help to take down Ragefire for the cleric who has been camping.<P>It's all about respect for other people. It's very true that no one "owns" a spawn, but we can at least be nice and care about other people who spent time on waiting for the very last quest mob.<P>------------------<BR>Rolant Starfield<BR>High Priest of Rodcet Nife<BR>Courageous Few<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Depends alot on your server, but my opinion...<P>The only way to "camp" Ragefire is to have a cleric with a shimmering pearl sitting on the spawn point. A monk FD in the lair has about as much right to claim the spawn as a ranger in the SS room that can catch him on tracking, IMO.<P>If the spawn is camped by a cleric, they have a reasonable amount of time to get the people there to kill it. I would think that there should be a sizable showing (at least 2 groups there) within 30 minutes. If they can muster 2 groups in 30 minutes and a full force within 90 minutes or so then everyone else should back off.<P>If Ragefire is not camped by a cleric, then it's a matter of who can get a capable force in the lair fastest. Whoever deems themselves ready and hands in the pearl first gets the spawn.<P><BR>I was involved in on particular dispute where someone saw Ragefire on track and 2 guilds went after him. One guild started attacking FGs with a force of 3-4 people. The other guild rushed past them with 3 groups of people to kill the rest of the FGs. By the time Ragefire was reached, the 3-4 people had grown to a group and the 3 groups of people had grown to a Ragefire capable force.<P>The single group claimed that Ragefire was theirs since they were first to kill a FG, and the other guild leapfrogged them. They then proceeded to cast on Zordak and drag him to the zone, so that the fully ready force could not hand in the pearl.

By the time Ragefire was reached, the 3-4 people had grown to a group and the 3 groups of people had grown to a Ragefire capable force.<P>The single group claimed that Ragefire was theirs since they were first to kill a FG, and the other guild leapfrogged them. They then proceeded to cast on Zordak and drag him to the zone, so that the fully ready force could not hand in the pearl. That was an ugly day.<P>------------------<BR><B>Merpa Gigglesnort, Muerta Bella, Shakah</B><BR>Citizen of the Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>(ok, I'm gonna cheat a bit, and this probably wont add much to the discussion.)<P>I would choose none of the above! : ) I would refer everyone to Luclin's Ragefire list (http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=587.topic) to see who's turn it is, and that would abruptly be the end of that. The list was violated only once months ago, and the retaliation against that guild was severe. Took them a little while for them to repair their reputation and make amends.<P>The reason why this list works though is because Luclin is *very* unusually calander- and reservation-oriented (due largely to the fact that the biggest "uber" guilds advocate the calander), and also because it was established very very early. No one on the server really has known anything in their experience regarding Ragefire that didnt involve the list. Trying to get each and every guild to agree to such a thing on servers where FFA, or "first come owns camp till they leave" reigns would be futile.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A) Druid can take a hike.  If you cant be arsed to make the effort to camp your own epic mob with the correct char then dont be surprised if nobody respects the camp.  I had a monk twink camped in the Lair i would use it to spot for Ragefire, BUT, if i lost the camp between finding him up and getting my cleric there then so be it.<P>B) Shouldn't take more than 2hrs to assemble & kill a dragon.  I have never subscribed to the first come first serve ethos in BGH (in terms of fighting force ready to move over force assembling), in my experience it's always been a method of exercising power over common courtesy and leads to nothing but bad blood.<P>A.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>For my ragefire, if someone was making it known they were camping ragefire, I wished them luck and went to do other things.  Their class/numbers were irrelevant.  They were there first.  The night after we killed Nagafen I dragged some friends to sit in the lair to pull bugs and kill FG respawns.  A couple times folks came asking about Ragefire, wished us well then went to do other things.  One night I zoned into the bat/bug zone-in and found a ranger there watching for ragefire.  I wished him luck and went to do other stuff.  Takes 30 seconds to see if ragefire is camped, so it's no loss.<P>A) If it's just one druid not even at the lair, and all FG's are up, they just stumbled onto the spawn.  No telling which guild spotted it first.  Race situation here, whoever's at the lair first, especially with a force to kill ragefire, should get right of way.<P>B,C,D,etc) Indefinitely, or until they give up.  They're obviously there first.  The less time you loom over them the more time you have to go accomplish stuff before the next ragefire spawns.  Give the cleric a chance.  They were likely there as a group to lessen the might-makes-right struggle, meaning they're not as mighty, so it will take them more time to mobilize.  If might-makes-right is the rule on FFA servers like A-Ro, then our opinions are kinda meaningless since you've already got a system in place. :P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I sat in Naggy's Lair for 18 hours to snag my Rage on EMarr.  Was about to log and he popped.  We didn't have but 10 or 12 ppl on so we called in a few friends, got to 21 and beat him down, we only had 1 wizzy!  If someone has been settin there since naggy was dropped and clearin FG's the dude has dedication, I would back down in that case, and did once.  Main thing, dont be a *editing original word* "jerk" about it.  Its just a game, this coming from someone who spent 18 hours in naggy's lair yes, but don't forget Karma.  What goes around comes around.  The level 30 druid is just a goof.  If you have a posse there and gtg on him with a 30 druid asking you not to, imo, screw druids.  If he is more interested in leveling his twink than camping Rage he don't need the Rez Beater.   Hand in yer pearl and go to owning.  <P>In all situations it could be worse, I have heard of clerics Ninja looting the heart and KSing Rage by sheer luck and Ninja'ing Rage.<p>[This message has been edited by Dalur - Veeshan (edited 04-04-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Tough call here Rayne.<P>I was in that situation when I was looking for Ragefire.<P>Killed the King of Chardok on a Friday night.<P>Had a guild hunt Saturday in POA to finish FA for a guild paladin.  I logged off for a break before POA and Ragefire spawned about 30 mins after I logged off.  Another guild got him.<P>Sunday took 2 groups and went in and cleared out the FG's.  I set up my camp in the corner in Naggy's lair.<P>Camped Mon, Tues, Wed for 4 and a half hours each night clearing FG's as they popped.<P>Thursday night I spent about an hour in Naggy's lair when Ragefire spawned.  I shouted in GU for people to come.  After 3 minutes later, I had 4 guild mates show up from Bats and Bugs and the the SS room and so forth.<P>There was another guild monk that had been FD  in Naggy's lair since about tuesday.  He stood up, then sat and camped out.  10 minutes later, I had a group and a half there.  A minute later 4 groups from this other guild came and started buffing and such.<P>Within 15 minutes, I had another 3 groups show up from my guild and 2 or 3 more groups from the other guild showed up.  My guild leader tried to talk with one of their officers, but they decided they weren't going to listen.<P>They handed in the pearl and spawned Ragefire.  We ended up having to back out of the situation.<P>Anyway, to answer your question.<P>Situation A:<P>I think the level 60's definitely should have gotten the camp.  According to the policies I have heard, 1 person can't claim a camp that they can't kill solo.<P>Yes that druid said they had guild mates on the way, but from what you described, the guild had not shown up prior to the giants being killed, therefore the level 60's had the right to Ragefire.<P><BR>In Scenario B - I think the right thing to do would have been give the camping groups a short period in which to get forces there and if they didn't meet the timeline, then let the other guild that had the numbers there take Ragefire.<P>I think a fair amount of time would be 30 mins.<P>S<P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>I *think* according to the play nice rules (which ultimatly should come into effect *if* a GM is called in)... says that if you have the force, and heading toward something (ie: ragefire), another force enters the zone they cannot take him.<P>They key is being ready... so I would say if 10 people are camping Ragefire but cannot kill him... and I enter with xx people who CAN kill him... PnP says I can go do it, since no force is there that can take him. (or the underpowered force can attack now and risk losing).<P>That being said, I guess I kind prefer honoring someone's camp.  I don't know how long someone should wait... I mean I can see someone sitting in there 24 hours waiting for everyone to come online, constantly saying they have the camp... that's not reasonable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The rule developed on Innoruuk with respect to Naggy and Vox is that the first group to kill a long spawn giant has precedence until the giants respawn.  I believe people are abiding by this with respect to Ragefire as well (he is a dragon after all).<P>Using this rule, neither the level 30 druid, nor the second group would get to kill Ragefire.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A few brief comments since a few of you know me:<P>-> These are all contrived scenarios.<P>-> The first "could" have applied to me.  A friend suggested we do the FGs, I said sure, then she said never mind, Druid was camping.  We then got into a discussion of whether or not we should honor that camp.  It became moot when some more friends showed up online and we went elsewhere.  (For the record I was of the opinion that no one player could "camp" Rage.)<P>-> I've never been involved in a dispute over Ragefire, although I've seen some (back on Karana).<P>-> Ayonae Ro is definitely a "might makes right" server Gello.  That being said we seem to do ok on it =).<P>-> I'm utterly amazed that Verant has yet to address this issue.

</FONT><HR>On a blue server, there are no 'right' answers.<P>It comes down to "are people gonna be self-centered, short-tempered, arrogant and megalomanical twits?"<P>Most often, they will and are.<P>Thus you have the PNP (Play Nice Policy), /petitions, guild flame wars, and all of that unpleasantness.  You have nice people (who play nice and try to consider others, and how others will consider them) who get regularly shafted by the twits.<P>I play on Tallon Zek.  It's a red server, in case you didn't know.<P>We have no PNP.  Right now, one of the top guilds has decided they're not going to allow anyone else to achieve a cleric epic.  Why?  Because they have four in their guild and there are less than four others on the entire server.<P>Every time Nag spawns, and then again when Rage is due, a huge pk war has been errupting in and around SolB, for a few weeks now.  I'd rather settle things like this, than in *any* of the ways bluebies settle things.<P>Why?<P>Because we can settle things ourselves, without whining to GMs or the server.  After an issue comes to head on TZ, it's always clear who won and who lost.  I might not like the occasional random PK attack from some empty-headed twit who thinks that kind of thing is funny (team pk), but I'd rather be kicked out of an area because the other people were more powerful than having to whine and petition about "they have our camp, waa waa waa make them share".<P>Nothing personal to you bluebies, of course.  But I'd much rather be killed and have to scoot than get all frustrated over being helpless to do anything about others' arrogance.<P>Besides, nothing says I/we (my team) always loses; sometimes we win.  So it works out ok.  If you can defend your 'camp', your 'zone', then you get to stay; this you do by making the others leave.  If you can't defend it, time to find other locales.<P>Simple, neh?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ok my general opinion here is that this is<BR>a very contested spawn and we all know that Verant needs to do something about it. Aside from that in Scenario A although I do not like the idea of alternatives camping I would expect them to keep the FG's killed so the path to Ragefire is clear.<BR>Scenerio B is a hard one but I would at least give them about 1/2 hr - 1 hour to organise a crew too dispatch Ragefire organising a crew too kill him is hard for many clerics that are independent of not part of an uber guild.<P>As a whole the problem here is really that Uber guilds in my believe are Farming these too there twink clerics as majority of their main clerics already have them.  This causes issues as Clerics that are ready too do Ragefire can't because of Farmers.  In my personal believe is a guild has its first cleric ready for Ragefire the Uber guilds should help that cleric get the Item as it will benefit not just possibly their guild should he decide to join them on raids but also his own guild.  Independant clerics are in a similiar boat.<P>My biggest Suggestion is that Uber guild should stop Farming for Twinks I personally know two guilds on Tunare that are doing this which will go unamed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>With due respect to the cleric (CLERIC) sitting at the spawn, you should allow hima reasonable ammount of time to gather forces. 30-45 minutes. If a sufficiant force fails to arrive in that time, take it. If the camper is a FD monk or a druid with tracking, then forget it. They had no right to it in the first place.<P>Now, on Xegony, if you start killing FG's to get to a dragon spawn, that dragon belongs to you until you kill it or give up. OR GIVE UP. Meaning, if you fail the first time, and wanna res and try again, that is your right. That is the rule for Naggy and Vox. I don't know if it applies to Ragefire, but it should since Ragefire spawns in Naggy's lair. So a more powerful group that leapfrog's you on the FG's is wrong. A group that jumps Ragefire to snag an easy kill, as your first attempt fails, is wrong. If you are clearing FG's as they spawn while you wait, then on Xegony, you have clear precident to Ragefire, so long as you don't give up. (or log off, which is the same thing).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The answer is simple.  Whoever spawns and kills Ragefire deserves the kill and the associated reward.  It's irrelevant who camped what for who knows how long.  Does the PnP say that someone sitting down near a spawn means that the person owns that spawn?  If so, can I sit next to a large wasp drone, claiming ownership, just to protect it from the rabid noobies.  "Don't kill this wasp, I'm medding up. It's MY spawn, though!"  How long do I deserve the claim?  Can I sit for 2 hours protecting the wasp?  This is the stupidity that I see here.<P>I do play by the PnP, but I don't agree with any of it.  Having been on Vallon Zek for 20 months, both as a PKr and a good guy, I am disgusted by the way disputes are handled in the carebear environment.  It is horrible roleplay, and not very fun at all, to not be able to claim ownership simply by mobilizing a force and wiping out whoever is camping.<P>Do you roleplayers feel comfortable seeing a Paladin and a Troll discussing who gets to kill the next spawn?  I just can't understand how this mentality makes any sense wihtin Norrath, or how it is fun, and I'm not even a big roleplayer.<P>I don't believe that might makes right, but I do believe that a mighty force is justified in taking whatever they damn well please.  In the case of Ragefire ownership on carebear servers.  I guess the GMs have to sort out who "owns" the camp, since they made the silly rules to begin with.  Tis a shame that GM's decide these things when clearly the game engine should have been built to allow for combat to settle this crap.<P>Given the complete lack of insight, and associated code, by Verant on these issues, I think whoever kill steals it first is completely justified in that action.  In the same respect, I believe that a monk who causes a train and FD's right in front of the kill stealer is ALSO justified in doing so.  The PnP is ridiculous to enforce.  Great as a code of ethics.  But a horrible way to determine who gets to kill a MoB.  Laughable at best.<P>My opinions are extreme even for the Zek servers.  However, we are a resilient bunch on VZ.  You respawn, you loot yer corpse, you go back to what you were doing.  You learn to be strong as a noobie.<P>An armed society is a polite society.<P>Trawma Siirjen<BR>45 High Elf Cleric<BR>United Legions<BR>Vallon Zek<BR>(and many others - some nice, some nasty as hell)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It's a matter of who has the ability to take the mob.<P>Petitioning to the GM got a response in specific relating to the Ragefire pop:  "Whoever hands in the pearl first is the one who can claim 'ownership' of the mob."<P>In regards to a cleric sitting at the spawn or not:  I disagree.  If you have the dedication to level a secondary so that you can watch the camp 24/7 then more power to ya.  In fact having a cleric sitting there limits your total camp time.  No example was given that described if the druid/monk/other was actually camping in lieu of a primary Cleric.<P>With that in mind, I'm sorry but this camp is a race to mobilize.  The most common agreed way to claim an ownership of this camp that I've viewed is if a group is already clearing fire giants, they have dibs on anything in the route (including Ragefire).<P>If the fire giants are cleared, then it's a matter of who gets there first and is ready to engage AND hands in the pearl.  Thank Verant for coming up with a competitive mess like this.<p>[This message has been edited by Atar (edited 04-04-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Scenario A-Z it dont' matter cause no one owns a spawn, until someone has actually engaged the MoB it's free for anyone. <P>The problem is then your conscience. Would I do that to someone? Probably not but under the right circumstances I would, if I myself had been camping it for a long time and took a break then came back to it or if the person camping it is lower level and has no chance in hell to get the MoB. <P>Need before greed i think should also apply to people not in your guild. Helping someone out who is in need will only pay off for you later on in your levels. I've had people I gave money to in order to buy their 1st level spells only to have them give me something when they've surpased me in levels. So maybe by judging who needs the weapon more you can make a friend for life  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> or an enemy:P<P>I don't like it but there are politics when you get to the higher levels and someone may not own the spawn but they could have been camping it for a long time and get very disgruntled when you bring the wrecking crew in. Then it looks bad on you and your guild.<P>I dunno, i don't ever want that bloody thing and i'm at work and bored out of my skull and babbling. I think each situation needs to be looked at individually and you judge, the important thing is to know when you are wrong and do the right thing, and if you're right then handle it in the best way you can without hurting peoples egos. or just ks em all and let Marr sort em out!!  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><p>[This message has been edited by Aean (edited 04-04-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A lot of this applies to me, since, my guild has been attempting to get Ragefire extensively in the last two weeks or so.<P>In my opinion, if Ragefire is up, he's fair game, and it's the responsibility of the people who spot him to gather the required forces to take him down before other groups do so.  Though I feel this is the case, I know that a lot of the guilds on my server(including my own) would not attempt to 'steal' Ragefire if another guild was mobalizing for him before our own.  For this reason we stick anywhere from 6-12 people in his lair to watch for him.<P>In the case of the druid tracking for Rage, they have no right to claim Ragefire, even though they have spent how many ever hours sitting there tracking for him.  It takes very little effort to log a druid/ranger alt at the SolA Bugs/Bats zone to just track every 5 minutes while you go off and do other things.  I personally have used this method, having a druid alt, but people who do should realize that other guilds will just shrug it off and take Ragefire anyway.<P>While actively camping the lair and killing FGs with a number of people, I know that most guilds on my server would have no problem with accepting that Ragefire is being watched for and just go their seperate ways if they believed that the competition too fierce.  If the group in the lair takes too long to mobalize, it's fair game for other guilds who wish to take him, but it's their decission to put their reputation on the line for a silly item.<P>In short, Rage is FFA, no matter if you have your entire guild sitting in the lair with you, or you are camping it solo with a low level alt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005920&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005920&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
