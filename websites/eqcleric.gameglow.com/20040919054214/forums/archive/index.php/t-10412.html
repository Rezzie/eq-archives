At level 13, you can also find a full group or close ot full to hunt on floor 3, killing ghouls, ice bones, etc. I was going to camp with the group for the items down there.<br />

There is a trap that will leave you with a non recoverable corpse... It is best to go in there with someone that has a map.... You may also want to make sure everyone in your party has a magic weapon.... my 1st trip we were not totally prepared and a wisp made things quite messy...<br />

That doesn't leave you with an unrecoverable corpse, you just have to find someone trustworthy to drap your corpse to the top. <br />
