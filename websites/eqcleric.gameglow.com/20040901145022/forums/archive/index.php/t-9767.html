Verant can kiss my dark elf but before i vote them #1 game. GO HALFLIFE<br />
i do like the game its just a point i trying to make. verant is being hypocritical.<br />

Message from Smed last nite at 10:30<br />
&quot;We are proud to announce that we finaly hit 50,098 simultaneous users&quot;<br />
<br />
Gee, I couldn't have been happier. Packet loss was at max, 8 servers were running 2000+ and Verrant is broadcasting a happy message??!!<br />
<br />
Vote for the game, make it number one, add 10,000 more people who want to &quot;try&quot; the #1 game.....see where this is leading?<br />
<br />
On a good note though, more players = a whole new market for items...then again SIGH..I guess Ebay business will pick up too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/em shudders at the memory of the constant broadcasts of marriages and who hit the 50th lvl.<br />
<br />
I also disapprove of all those players who spam what they are auctioning.  But eh, thank goodness for /ignore.  Now too bad there's no /ignore silly broadcasts<br />
<br />
I really don't like all of that spamming.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whitesun</div><div class="date">01-21-2000, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on Bristlebain, where the camps are crowded, the lag is high, and every zone has 80 people in it (and those are the quiet uncrowded ones)  Ill vote it best game when they earn that title. I like the game and I want to continue playing the game.  However, recent events and LAG have make it unenjoyable and unplayable for me. I hope that they fix this befor they put themselves out of business. <br />
