<br />
Lets face it, something better comes along we are ALL going.  Thats what we do.  The developers know there are alot of us out there and we will pay 10 bucks a month (maybe more) and 50 bucks to buy the game and play it for hours on end.<br />
<br />
How many people here that used to play Diablo still do?  How about UO?  I used to play Diablo until UO came out and I used to play UO until I got into EQ beta phase 2.  UO2 is looking good and if it stands up to its move...bye bye EQ.<br />
<br />
Like the guy eating a pbj sandwich wouldnt give it up for a steak.<br />
<br />
I know, I know, your just trying to show your distaste for the game as it stands right now.  You know what?  You wanna show your distaste....turn around and look out the window...A Life00 is out there and its not waiting for you to get the &quot;next better game&quot;.  Take a deep breath, stand up and walk away, go get the next best life until the next best game goes live. <br />

Any upgrade to what we enjoy will entice us away from the lesser version of what we like to do, as long as there is no emotional tie to override an objective choice.  If we have a 50+ character on EQ, it might be hard to give that character up and start over on Neverwinter Nights.  Rather, in that case, we will most likely play both games.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the new MMORPGs on the horizon will dilute the ACTIVE player base on EQ more than it will the PAYING player base, at least at first.</div></div><hr />
