<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbletoe</div><div class="date">06-19-2000, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok.  I'll rant.  I hate the fact that me and a wizard soloed stuff in TT the other day, and we didn't even have a CHANCE to die.  I used maybe 3 heals the entire time.  And I got a bubble of experience and about 60pp in loot.  WTH!!  <br />
<br />
And the next night, I went to hate.  And I died.  ONCE!!  Can you believe that??  Gees...  (I did loose the loto for the Cleric Boots, but oh, well, I'll be back).  It wouldn't have been too bad, but the group I was in was getting most of the kills.  And with 5 Clerics in that group of groups, who was amoung the 2 that actually made the camp when the train came??  Me.<br />
<br />
I tell you.  It is experiences like this that just want to make you chuck it all and go back to playing on the Playstation.  Good loot, good xp, almost no dieing, ...<br />
<br />
(I figued since this post was in fun, I'd have some fun with it.  It really was a good weekend (other than loosing that loto).)<br />
