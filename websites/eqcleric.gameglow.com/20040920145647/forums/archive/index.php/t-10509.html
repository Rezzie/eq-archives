Find you way to the feerott zone, then head back into the zone and take the first left. This area is Necro valley and has a bone tower on your left with two gnome necros. Unless you have a full group, stay away from them.<br />
<br />
The undead camp is on the left and past the bone tower, you will see some ruins there. There are at least a dozen spawns in this area. I usually clear it from right to left. At this levell you need at least one other cleric/healer with you and a tank or two for the tougher skeletons. Avoid the skeletal monk unless you have a full group with at least 2 nukers. They spawn rate is fairly fast and includes zombies, skeletons, iceboned skeletons, dryboned skeletons, giant skeletons, barbed skeletons and skeletal monks. Recently a &quot;dark boned&quot; giant skeleton has been added here, it drops one of the items for the Caduceus of the Sacrament.<br />
