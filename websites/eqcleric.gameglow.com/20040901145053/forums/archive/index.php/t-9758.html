I need more wisdom and why not. After getting all the other needed items and finally finding the spot being already camped i thought I'd stay and save my camping spot. After a couple hours it spawns.. yay. Mine turn now. Hours turn into more hours. Forcing to keep my eyes open into the night its 10 min before the spawn. Counting down the minutes. What do you know? I go LD. I get back on (Still very tired), and find someone saying hey i finally got him! D'OH! Next day I retimed and managed to pull him out in 4 more hours. Pain is a bad thing heh =)</div></div><hr />

Just the other day I was helping my level 35 Druid friend camp the ghost in Unrest.  Well, we cleared the room and are waiting for the TT to spawn first.  He spawns, I blast him, then I go LD.<br />
<br />
Well, soon after the ghost does spawn and not only takes out my Linkdead butt, but my friends too.  Oh well, dems da breaks.</div></div><hr />

And there, you get to fight with druids for the chance to sit too - only instead of 8 hours max, try 40? or 50?<br />

We got there and there was a level 19 druid there already.  Would you believe this guy actually had the nerve to ask us if we would kill the guard for him and let him loot the page.  Sheesh...like I was logging in there for my health.  Talk about dumb.  When we refused, the little jerk just snared him and kited him away to the zone like a typical druid.<br />
