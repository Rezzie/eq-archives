<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">02-19-2000, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're happily camping the lord in lower Guk, I as cleric just came back from being LD due to Cerfnet issues (30 minutes to log back in) the party working on replacements for some leaving had extra help but things were getting ugly.<br />
 My mana was around 60 and I rejoined, the others leave and we're back to 5 with a 6th coming.<br />
 They arrive, the lord spawns and we kill it...we lotto, a warrior wins the ssb...and as I'm telling her to loot a MONK runs by me I am sitting in doorway to the throne room...<br />
<br />
 Me WTF?<br />
 Catbik OH Sh@#<br />
 SPRITE Oh...<br />
 CATBIK RUN RUN RUN RUN (macroed several time) and even then all the battle spam ensueing it's barely noticed...<br />
 <br />
 I didn't even stop to look...there were DAR's ZOL's GUK's everywhere...and a FD monk at my feet...(GOSH I wish i could have kicked him in RL)<br />
<br />
 CATBIK gates out, the rogue successfully hides...<br />
 While me the paladin and the bard try to run for the zone...(mana was for ****, I had maybe 5%-10% and no gate memmed and was agro to all the froggies since they followed the monk in right as top off healed the bard with a GHeal)<br />
 I hit the area near the pit and Hit DB, Paladin is ahead of me...I yell TRAIN, the whole group does in fact... by the time I hit the room just past  the safe hall I see that the whole area is at full spawn ( and there were 68 in the zone...a strange occurence most were on live side) Up past and empty savant room add three more frogs...I get nuked hard...50%  life now... YES with DB on I got FORCE shocked between pulses of DB, I spin, Up to ASS/Supllier area...Warrior falls, bard never made it past the safe hall area, paladin is ahead of me asses n heels...<br />
I DA hit water and dive dive dive... I surface near the hallway and am stunned...DA goes bye bye, I get out of the water, the Pallie turns and hits me with a GHeal...saving my life...<br />
<br />
 NO one at zone, though we did pass a dwarf in the water and I hope to god he was invis undead... and I hit zone...with 12 hitpoints...blasted through by a wiz ghoul...<br />
I come out in cleric death march...no mana and yes as I check logs I resisted the force shock...12 hitpoints...<br />
 paldin made it through... I med up...he heals me... I modulate... and invis him tell him to get down to lord to loot the lord before the bastard Monk does...rogue says bard died because he was smart enough to loot  before he was agroed by the hoard of frog ghouls...<br />
 I med...paladin gets down there as do the mage and they start pulling bodies of the dead to safe hall...<br />
 I inform the warrior that checking the roll logs she won and bard has the ssb (party hat) for her once we rez her...<br />
 I get healed by a cleric sitting there ....<br />
 &quot;You brother are one mauled up piece of dwarf meat...let me fix you up a bit.&quot; <br />
 From inside I hear &quot;ONE BOK UP hurry&quot;<br />
 I med as hard as I can emoting smoke coming from my ears...I drop a stack of beer for the dwarf to get (it's gone before it hits the ground) at 75% I invis and zone in...<br />
 I swim no new bodies at zone and none in water or BR, whew we didn't kill anyone in our mad dash to the zone, I guess folks heard our screams and or saw the monks mounting train...and GTFO'd<br />
 I jump down to safe hall, and immediately rez the bard...heal him and med...bard has mana song up and running immediately, rogue says monk disappeared (logged?) we try for a name...I check logs (many shift page ups) and nope no warning from him...<br />
 Rogue says he;s sneaking out...Two Boks...<br />
and as he hits hallway...a dreaded message..<br />
 A GUK WIZARD CASTS A SPELL (they are notorious in seeing invis anything-including hidden rogues...he gets out safely) and comes past a now fully spawned hallway past teh magi spawn area and to the jail and to safehall...Now me and paladin invis and head up to stairs near ass hall to rez teh warrior..I rez, pallie heals and I invis her, we sit...ass room pulls from nearby and a horde goes up there and we see a fast scroll of XXX MOB DIES repeated over n over...(7 mobs in 15 seconds)<br />
 She dresses and gets reinvis'd and runs down with pallie in tow incase a fully spawned room and a failed invis gets her dead again...<br />
 I peekinto ass room...a wizard, a necro and i see a couple of other names up there and a huge fire pet...I jump down ladder and step into hole and am on 3rd floor again...<br />
 Into safe hall...bard has to log soon as do the warrior...we invis up and head to hall before lord...<br />
 Mage takes a wrong turn and comes back...invis failed I reinvis him and myself...we head off and he turns wrong and finally  ends up in frenzy (where he's picking up a replacement to the suddenly camped rogue-who is very pissed off)They are added and teh call comes...help near frenzy...pallie and bard rush there invis...to help ...<br />
 I peek into lord room...two boks...okay I root one and keep it stunned while the group wails on the other...a replacement bard sits next to me happy to be next on list, she's waited days to get in a group, this is her first time ever...we exchange emotes...<br />
 Suddenly a Dar wanders into the lord room...ignoring her and me...she had invis undead from her last group luckily...<br />
 then double messages... GUK WIZARD CASTS<br />
 GUK WIZARD CASTS...three times over...and out of the room come three fully buffed DARS and they wander back to their spots in the hallways (Is this new? they weren't wanderes, they took up regular spawn points in the hallway) <br />
 So this makes four tough ass spawn in lord room...party is resting here and I inform them of the dread news...we have 6 there and two more waiting to help us...they group up and **** hits fan again... the next group of dars comes waltzing up to the group...<br />
 battle ensues in the doughnut in front of the lord room , I have to force blast the dar to move it away from the door and finally the  warrior agroes it with a proc and backs up...I med...they fight I pop and sheal four times sitting to med immediately, call comes for a Cheal on the guest bard...I do it, after a Gheal to keep her alive...it goes off with a dar pounding on me...<br />

 (AC Suit was on at the time and only had reso up) AC 711...<br />
 Other bard sings a different tune and dar goes at her full force a SK has joined the battle and the three now hadle that frog...<br />
MED HEAL MED HEAL...GET BARSHED...HEAL MED MED MED...(not one fizzle or interupt-Thank Brell)<br />
 Fights over and the wanderers from the jail come to play...med heal med heal...mage is OOM, his mega water pet, near death, several in my group are 60% health or less...<br />
 The others there are in similar health...Warrior asks for invis and jets, SK joins, Bards switch out after I invis too...<br />
 Leader (the Mage) Looks in Room and says &quot;CRAP IT's OVER GUYS...The lord respawned with sword in hand (looked to be a FS), two GUKS wizes, and two BOKS...&quot;<br />
 POOF three disband even before I check zone for friends that owe me for lifesaving heals as I passed through area, or the REZES I did when I really just wanted to get to bed (three the night before)...<br />
 OOC (ME) NEED HELP BREAKING FULL RESPAWN OF LORD ROOM...Open rolls...<br />
 Group is angry...I say &quot;WE do it alone (group) we all die this time for sure ( i wasn't planning too I had gate memed and DB had just reset)&quot;<br />
 They say in their own ways...screw this, who was that monk?<br />
 STILL NO ONE KNOWS...<br />
 I checked my logs, and yes my GF had hit the screenshot buttong several times...<br />
 All I can see is a nekkid human male's feet and no name tag... and Him FD'ng into the firepot there in corner...which effectively camoed his name from me...<br />
 <br />
 If I can find out who this was, and what made him bring all these friends to us, in a far off corner of deadside that the throne room is I still wonder...<br />
 The ZOne had remained silent the entire time... No one answered OOC's as to who it had been, or why he had done it.<br />
 The Rogue hadn't thought of doing a /who monk to see who it was or just done a /who and eliminated people from looking at shouts and ooc's.<br />
<br />
 What I fear was that this was a suicide run to clear out the lord room (in parts and whole the core of this group had been there all day friday and into the late morning...often replacing leaving memebers with older ones) We were determined to get the rangers and the bard's their Ykesha's...yes I gave my rolls to the bard so he could get two rolls for the item (not party hat though- they all had won at least one of them so far that camp)<br />
 <br />
 ALL in all a fairly safe camp got killed by one person who logged out upon a sucessful FD...<br />
 If he had been coming to see if he could have gotten a spot and yelled that he was ambushed...I'd have gotten the pallie to drag him to me for a rez and reinvis...but this doesn;t seem to be the source ...<br />
<br />
Berotoxxulous was strangely quiet too, EC empty of salespeople after 4am...usually fridays late the aussies and japanese come on to buy and sell then...nada...<br />
<br />
I talked to others in lower guk...nope they either evac;d upon our BIG ASS train warning or all ran to cav room or exe room and or ass room to get out of the path...<br />
 SIGH...even a wizard in our group would have never had a chance to evac us...<br />
<br />
 OKAY ALL DONE...I WENT TO FP and GOT DEAD DRUNK on my FAYDWERE BOMBERS...(ELVEN WINE +GNOMISH SPIRITS +DWARVEN ALE CHASERS)<br />
 I log into a very strange perspective of East freeport tonight....<br />
