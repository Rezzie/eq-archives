<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaldiana D'Ozz</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was killing some time in Sol B while waiting for a friend to log on and I heard the people gearing up for a raid on Naggy (it was primarily a guild raid).  As a joke at one point, I ooc'd &quot;Nah, you guys aren't ready, you need another cleric!&quot;  Immediately after I get a tell from a friend (*hugs Lythander*  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif) saying &quot;WE DO!  Where are you and do you know the way down?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Woot!  Seems that 54 druid didn't want to be playing cleric to two warriors.  Can't imagine why.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  Five minutes later I'm with a group fighting my first fire giant.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Soon after we killed the first few giants, they did a preroll for some upcoming potential no drop items (mithral mask, Naggy's monk book, Skarlon's sword).  They automaticallly included all INT and WIS casters on the mask (their rules, and no, I'm not opening this up to arguments :P) and to my great shock, I won the preroll!  The other two preroll winners happened to be in my group too...talk about an excited group!  Now not only was I excited about getting to be on the raid, but I was really hoping that Rokyl remembered to get dressed right.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Well to make a long story short (too late I know): <br />
<br />
-Rokyl DID have the mask (woohoo!) so I am now very happy to have a higher AC in a slot I didn't think I'd be able to without giving up WIS.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
-Only one of my two warriors died (got summoned back just he was headed back for a heal of course) but I lost both my druid and my shaman when the casters rushed in.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
-I didn't get to see Naggy alive since the clerics stayed back in the prep room so I still really haven't seen a dragon  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif but  I did get a great screenshot of him dead.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
-My group thanked me for coming by giving me 40 jasper and 20 peridots.  Completely unnecessary, totally unexpected, but very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
All in all, I had a complete blast!  Now I can't wait for my first chance to try Vox.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

My first attempt on Nagafen failed miserably.  <br />
My 2nd attempt on Nagafen went fairly smoothe and we smashed him down.  <br />
<br />
My first attempt on Vox went fairly smoothe other than the fact I found the bear pits the wrong way.<br />

Our guild had booked her, but one of the most powerful guilds have a very rude attitude and snatched her just because they could. oh well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, do you think my resistgear is sufficcient? I have unbuffed svcold off 121 for vox and unbuffed svfire off 114 for naggy. svmagic is only 57 or so. Is this sufficcient, or do I need more of some resist? This char is a magician btw, my cleric is only 24.</div></div><hr />

Your fire and your cold look pretty good.  Not sure if you have any items that are cold/fire and MR.  That seems a bit low, but your cold/fire will be good against the AE spells.  If you are in a group with a bard, you shouldn't take any damage from the AE spells.<br />
