Right now the guild my paladin and human cleric (not my de) is has finally gotten to the point where the majority is above 47 and wants to start doing hardcore raids. Our core raiding group consists of 12 on hardcore players and another 10 flaky players. Where is a good place to do a real hard core 2 group raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yinn</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you are a young guild I would start with small epic fights for those that are around 50. This would include some fun runs on ToFS, Phinny, and possibly trying some planes.<br />
<br />
There are also some personal quests your guild could work on like Chardok faction and then you can go after very low bosses like Drussila.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is to xp most of the time and raid once a week or twice. Getting epics will make you stronger, but xp will be needed to get those epics.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

As far as Epics only the clerics and the one pally dont have them. As far as Chardok any peticular website on Chardok faction you would recomend?<br />

<br />
If so, and you are looking to get some 60 spells the High Priest in Acrylia is the easiest way. He drops mostly priest class 60 spells but you can farm him. Sometimes he drops crap, and sometimes a treat. You toss a low level person out on the platform to &quot;sacrifice&quot; and then the ring script begins. Less than 2 groups can do this.<br />
<br />
Here is a map: http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/acrylia1.jpg <br />
<br />
I do not know about the chardok thing, it takes a very loooong time, but great items. Here are some threads to look at:<br />

<br />
Other things you can look at if you have some 60's are Va'Dynn and Umbral Planes.</div></div><hr />

Our core group the 2 lowbies so to speak is my pally and the human cleric mule so we have 3 clerics on a raid due to our heavy druid population. <br />
Btw great links thank you.</div></div><hr />
