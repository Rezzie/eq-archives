   Let the SPAM begin !!  It's the only way to get us heard is to FILL the in box with  the title  &quot;Druid balancing&quot;.  When they read it cause we all KNOW they don't read anything about a cleric.  We get to fool them :)<br />
<br />
   Enjoy i've already sent  10  i'll setup a machine to just send a message every 1 min until i get heard.  This is becoming  SICK, at how the cleric class is being ignored.<br />
<br />
  Enjoy</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if your message is meant to be colorful hyperbole or if you were actually intending to do this. But this is not behavior to be encouraged.<br />
<br />
Yes, many clerics (myself included) are filled with anxiety about this change but there is no excuse to engage in this type of illegal and unethical behavior, especially over *gasp* a game.<br />

I hope this thread gets locked.</div></div><hr />
