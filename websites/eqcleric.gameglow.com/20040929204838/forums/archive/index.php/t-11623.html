<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serendine</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was a wonderful patch to be a Cleric. I'm overjoyed with the Ragefire change. I may actually start my epic quest in a month or so after the changed-induced wave overcamping dies down! Before that message today I had given up hope of EVER getting my sprinkler.<br />
<br />
I think the new heals are great. Clerics will need something to keep them desired in EXP groups once the Dru/Shm BigHeal spells come in, and these heals help that. I also agree they need something a BIT more, but the Hammer needs to go. It's the WRONG solution.<br />
<br />
This (and dang, ain't it ugly?) thing is now the new ultimate melee weapon of choice for EVERY 56+ cleric. THIS IS WRONG. An unguilded two-box soloist's pocket-templar should not have access to the same quality of melee weapons that 120+AA uberguilded High Priests have access to. Clerics should be using weapons of their appropriate &quot;gear class&quot; in combat.<br />
<br />
This is a two-part fix. The first is to replace Y5 with a spell that: <br />
<br />
   *Gives Haste, Dex and STR and Mana Regen just like it does now (though I'd prefer direct ATK to STR personally)<br />
<br />
   *Imbues caster with a high-frequency proc: A wrath-like DD like the one on the Summoned Hammer<br />
<br />
   *Adds a scalar +bane undead to your CURRENT weapon so Clerics can melee with the weapon of their choosing. The +bane should be about equivalent to melee damage bonuses, maybe less for slow 2-handers; +60bane would be too much. This would put a Jade Mace to about where the current Summoned Hammer is<br />
<br />
In combination with the YaulpV (Y5) change, the Hammer spell needs to change too. Change the effect on it to Dismiss Undead (for further enhanced vs undead soloing - 2 procs!) and put its ratio in the ballpark of 15/40.<br />
<br />
What we'd have here is when we're NAKED we can summon a relatively weak weapon, and Y5 for some proc damage. When fighting undead, we have a weapon thats Wurmslayer-Ratio with TWO procs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening,</div></div><hr />

So no, you don't need to keep it memmed except when you'll be actually meleeing. =)</div></div><hr />

I think the hammer is great.  14/18 is a pretty nice ratio for a cleric weapon, and against undead, it's 24/18, something I thought I'd never see for my cleric.<br />
<br />
Remember, this is a game.  We're supposed to be playing it for fun.  We all pay the same $13 a month for our account, and we all choose our own path in the game.  If someone wants to dual box a cleric, it doesn't make them a horrible person.  They're playing the game how they want to play it.<br />
<br />
Your gear and your guild tag don't make you more deserving of something over someone else.<br />
<br />
VI gave us some fun new toys!  Last night, me and another cleric went to the Grey to duo, then to FG, then to chardok, then to SF.  We had a blast with the new spells.  EQ was actually fun for the first time in a long time for the both of us because we were able to do things that we'd never been able to do before.  Granted, we probably could have duo'd the same mobs last week before the patch, but the downtime would have been terrible.<br />
<br />
Just get out there and have fun!  Don't worry about what everyone else is doing, let them dual box their clerics, if anything, they're the ones who are missing out, feel sorry for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serendine</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You shouldn't be able to BUY your end-all be-all weapon from the STORE for an entirely trivial amount of platinum. Some spells are that way, but weapons never have been.<br />
<br />
What would you think of a 70/40 Magical War 2hs Req. lvl 51 selling at the vendor outside the EFP bank for 100pp? What if your guildmaster gave out 80AC tunics? What if those 6gp food crystals summoned 800hp healing potions?<br />
<br />
It's the same thing.<br />
<br />
Yes, I think we all agree that the hammer is fun. But at some point you have to look at how it compares to everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaminah</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hammer is great for xp grouping.  Damage wise, the ratio is great for a cleric.  However, 5wis, 35 hp/mana isn't so hot as far as stats go.<br />
<br />
Most high end clerics spend a majority of their time raiding.  There are tons of weapons out there that own the summoned hammer stat-wise.  The summoned hammer wasn't designed to replace all weapons out there, it was designed for use in xp/solo situations to make us more versatile.  I'll use my summoned hammer when I'm soloing or duoing or in an xp group where I have the freedom to melee, but when I'm raiding, or in a group in a tougher spot, you won't see me carrying the summoned hammer, I'll be using a better weapon that has beneficial stats.<br />
<br />
The new hammer isn't the &quot;end-all-be-all&quot; weapon for clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree. Every Cleric should have this because every &quot;pocket&quot; druid has the same exact spells as a 120 AA Druid and can solo just as well. There is no difference. Why should clerics be any different? <br />
<br />
The only difference between a fresh out of the box 54 druid and a druid that is level 60 with 1000000 AA points would be downtime and the ability to save his/her arss in a bad situation. Thats it. So clerics should be the same way.<br />
<br />
I agree the hammer itself is not a great fix. I already see clerics putting it away, and groups that wont take clerics that want to melee. However, its good as a change up.. Its good for make clerics more interesting and less boring..<br />
<br />
Its also good for clerics to fear kite, and perhaps even solo on there own toe to toe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serendine</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new hammer isn't the &quot;end-all-be-all&quot; weapon for clerics.<br />
<br />
Note that I said &quot;weapon&quot;. As in, something used to attack. Paw of Oppala and Cone of the Mystics are not WEAPONS. Gorgona Spiked Clubs and Tae Ew War Mauls are. See the comparison?<br />
<br />
IMO there needs to be one of two things.<br />
<br />
a) Make my above changes to YaulpV so that every Cleric can use it to fight with weapons available to them.<br />
<br />
b) Create new high-end weapons that are CLR useable that will outdamage the summoned hammer.<br />
<br />
I doubt that B is viable, because it seems that VI has already decided how much melee damage Clerics in &quot;battle mode&quot; should be doing. <br />
<br />
My point is, that once a cleric hits 56, melee damage doesnt scale with the equipment that Cleric has access to, and this is in direct contradiction to every other class in EQ.<br />
<br />
every &quot;pocket&quot; druid has the same exact spells as a 120 AA Druid and can solo just as well. There is no difference. <br />
<br />
Now I may be a little off on my Druid spells, but does every 60 druid have Moonfire? What about Ancient:Starfire of Ro?<br />
<br />
Same thing with Wizards and elec rending or sunstrike. Or Shamans and torpor.<br />
<br />
If this was a rare-drop expensive spell, or even a quested spell like PoTC I wouldn't gripe about it. But the thing is, when you can buy a spell from a vendor that summons the best DPS weapon available to your class, I think that's a bit messed up. It's like Mages buying their epic spell that summons the orb of mastery from the store.<br />
<br />
But we're talking melee weapons here, not spells.<br />
<br />
My change would allow more weapon options to a melee Cleric. You could use whatever weapon you want and fight with it with reasonable effectiveness with my proposed YaulpV Changes.<br />
<br />
And what would really be cool, is more Y5-type spells at lower levels. You couldn't really modify the current Yaulp line, because Pallies get those too. So you'd need a new spell line. I'd say one at 19, one at 34 and one at 49.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know too many clerics post 50 who wield a Paw or a Cone.  Here's what my cleric's weapon bag looks like.  None of these are recent additions, I've carried all of these with me for a long time.<br />

<br />
I think you're mistaken here.  Even with Yaulp and the new hammer proc'ing like mad (which it doesn't anymore), we're still not DPS gods.  With 175 skill in 1hb, I miss a lot when I'm trying to melee blue mobs.  My atk is 838 unbuffed with the summoned hammer in my hand.  Compare that to a warrior or a ranger or SK, who has an average of 1k to 1300 atk unbuffed at 60.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying Clerics are DPS gods, this isn't about how much damage a Cleric does vs a Bard or Knight for example.  Yes, those are all nice items. I can see the need for stats in a raid situation. But you miss the point.<br />
<br />
This is about how much damage the lvl 56 summoned hammer does compared to other Cleric weapons.<br />

Are there ANY weapons a Cleric can use that outdamage the summoned hammer?<br />

Well I think you hang out with the &quot;wrong people&quot; I weild a Paw and know several who do. Or I did until the new spell made it into my spell book. I am an unwise human and need every wisdom point I can get. And moreover I have no spare cash for a hammer which doesn't do much damage. Or nothing for a nice hammer, as they are quite expensive. I like the hammer and I hope they sort out the progression with it.</div></div><hr />

Now wouldn't it be REALLY cool if you use the Sun hammer with YaulpV for +10bane undead and an additional 170'ish proc? 31/22 vs undead, dual procs all those stats to boot!<br />

The developers just caved in to the pleas of candyass nancyboys who can't be bothered to learn how to utilize the tools they're given in a manner that best benefits them, because it's too HARD.   Soloing a cleric never was hard if you went with your strengths and picked on enemies who your spells are directly geared against.   We're talking about undead here kiddies.   Why the hell should you want or need some uber weapon to smack things around with when you already have fear, stun, and specific anti undead DDs and DOTs that annihilate these mobs if you simply apply yourself?  Sure it's not fast all the time, and there is the matter of ass-plant time, but it goes with the territory of being a caster class, and there are very very few classes out there than can even come close to rivaling the smackdown ability clerics arleady held for dealing with the undead.   Making paladins obsolete is not the solution.  Clerics should not be encouraged to run up and melee ****, that's what paladins are for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caudex</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our undead nuke line actually ends before our live nuke line.  Its more efficient, slightly, and about 400 dmg less than the 56 nuke unless we want to spend 60pp to make the mob cease to exist for no loot or exp.  We can stack the 39 and 52 undead dots for about 1200 damage.  Clearly we are undead monsters of destruction.  Those are collecting dust like a champ, I'm not even sure where my undead spells are in the book anymore.  Stun isnt going to kill anything I'm not sure what that has to do with soloing or killing period, thats mana better spent elsewhere unless the mob heals or nukes(hard).  Fear without snare yeah theres a good idea.  I havent ever annihilated anything above an orc pawn and I dont expect to.  I dont really care I never expected to melee or do spell damage.  Its nice that we have a somewhat viable solo option now, big deal.  It makes us slightly more stackable, cool we'll probably need that coming up although it was and still is pretty much absurd to have 2 clerics in a group.  I kind of wonder if we can do more damage than a shaman pet.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole I'm upset cause some L33t cleric and some other gimp 56-60 cleric in a Newb guild may use one of the same pieces of gear big deal.  Its just to give us a damage output for small soloing or easy (note easy, I'm not screwing around meleeing in 4c or ssra unless we are pulling hella slow) grouping spots with little damage.  I think its just supposed to be now a cleric can do some damage, still not a whole lot, and they didnt want us to do it with spells particularly dots.  Guess who would piss and moan if they did that.  No not everybody has moonfire or Ancient ..anything, all the 60 druids I know have moonfire not that it matters, but I think its safe to say ewber clerics wont be meleeing the emperor instead of healing and they certainly better have superior stat items compared to this summoned hammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a perfect solution to our class.  It doesn't add much to our DPS compared to root-DOTing undead, but it gives us other options for soloing and for grouping (How many groups do undead?)<br />
<br />
This does NOT marginalize paladins in the slightest.  Paladins still do two to three times our damage, and have half of our healing/buffing and res capabilities.  Seems fair to me.  Paladins have half our spells.  We have half of paladins melee ability.  Where's the problem here?<br />

The new hammer lets us kill greens quickly and effectively.  It lets us kill blues with a bit of effort.  I can solo for about a yellow an hour now in certain spots provide I have c3, which is not that hard to get nowadays.<br />
<br />
It lets us add a bit of dps when we can't sit down.  Yaulp 5 is great - it lets us regen mana when sitting down is out of the question due to agro purposes, it lets you increase efficency in all long casting spells or right click (blessing of aegolism costs 30 mana less off the top, right clicking velious legs is now efficent for 2 people rather than 3).<br />
<br />
The hammer is not a soloing god tool - you have to pick the targets carefully if you wish to get good exp.  You have to pick undead and you have to pick low ac critters.  Then the melee stats mean something and you can do a good bit of dps.  <br />
<br />
I have the level 56 hammer and I feel much safer wandering around - anything that attacks me im reasonably certain I can now kill with the proc unless they are really high level.  The proc rate on the level 60 hammer is said to be 50% higher than the store bought one, so it will be a nice add to the weapon when it drops.  <br />
<br />
Is hitting yaulp 5 a pain in the butt - yes most assurdly.  So is hitting bash - but it gives you something to do, and more importantly something not to do when you have alot of things to do.  The ability to juggle melee skills, hitting yaulp and bash all of the time, watching peoples health, and the health of the mob will lead to a much more active exping roll, which is what we have been complaining about - the fact that we do not help add dps to a group and had nothing much to do.<br />
<br />
So on the whole I like the hammer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets see y'all belong to guilds who run around, rumblecrush - dead 5 min setup 2 min kill, cleric equipeed, lets run quick up to 2nd floor of ssra, buncha more equip, hey, I hear Velketor is up..lets all zip over there and down him...great another 30 min...hmm what shall we do with the rest of our evening.<br />
<br />
You are not representative.  You are not typical.  Other clerics should be able to play the game for an hour stretch without having to run to some zone at the ends of the world to find an undead.<br />
<br />
What other class is so limited in soloing....please...I'm waiting to hear.  Can you say Quad,  can you say healing armor (war).<br />
<br />
Its about uptime people.  Yes you can root/dot undead for 750 a pop.  But how much mana do you end up with at the end.  Don't even want to hear a response with anyone above FT1.  How long til the next mob?  Does it compare with any other classes recovery time?...Not until the hammer it didnt.<br />
<br />
Was the hammer the right solution?  Probably not.  Does it make some of your hard earned weapons less valuable.  probably so...welcome to the hard life as verant sees it. <br />
<br />
Hard to put a fix in for us we couldnt then use in group or raid situations which would be majorly unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

I for one refused to buy the stupid hammer and all the other spells for that matter they are ghey beyond belief IMHO.<br />
<br />
I want to be fixed, I want to be upgraded, I DONT want to be a pally.....I dont want Pally's to have the same buffs as me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tasala</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 03:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Hammer of Souls does in fact proc like the pre-nerf hammer. I got the hammer very soon after the nerf so I never saw much of a change. We are not Paladins, nor will be become Paladins. I parsed some logs and I was doing around 30-31 DPS for a total of 487,000 in melee for the time I was playing. These upgrades take lots of the boredom out of playing a cleric, god knows I've been bored lots since Beta2. Most of the people I see complaining are &quot;newbies&quot; in comparison to people who like it. When I mean &quot;newbies&quot; I mean people who never had to wear bronze at level 45. Didn't have to wait to get an exp res until level 39, and a gimpy on at that. The newer players are just about handed decent gear, have easy mobs to fight that give huge exp, and get 96% resses from friends or clerics wandering through the zone. Some of us felt we earned some of this fun after dealing with all of the boredom we had previously faced. Certainly not everything was boring, but the exp grind is/was.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;Paladins are getting all of our spells!&quot; complaint, you are 100% correct! This of course is assuming you are blind to us being upgraded, or you refuse to get any of the new spells we will get with PoP. Paladin ALREADY have spells the same as ours, Symbol of Pinzarn and lots of other AC, HP, buffs, they just get them later in life. You should weigh &quot;all&quot; info before passing a simple comment like &quot;Paladins are getting all of our spells!&quot;.<br />
<br />
All in all, there were melee clerics before this change was even on the drawing board. I got my Noose early on in TT, and always ask for SoS so I can sneak melee in when I was FoM. Always laughed at, until now, now I can laugh since I'm already ahead of the curve, maxxed in h2h, 1hb, 2hb, offense, and I already know what to do and not do in melee. These changes are lots of fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HelzaTheDorf</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is a big leap to say &quot;all&quot; spells when I used &quot;most&quot;. If you go out and look most of the lvl 59 spells and lower will now be given to pallys. <br />
<br />
So a 59 cleric or lower will have even less to offer  a group since they can get all those buffs from a pallys.<br />
<br />
I've played EQ for two and half years does that give me the right to rant or no? I never had Bronze cause I did armor quest in my 30's, so I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
But in the end if you want to melee more power to you... but realize if you take this as a &quot;fix&quot; VI will move on to another class.<br />
<br />
I for one would rather hold out for a decent fix then take this piece of junk.<br />

The fact I said all is not relevant, heck they can have them all. The comparison I'm making, you are missing. They are not getting them at the same level as we are and we scale accordingly. Why wasn't the same issue brought up when we went to level 60 from 50? Paladins got Symbol of Naltron, Resoloution, Shield of Words, and a group heal, Wave of Prexus. That didn't make us less desireable and it sure didn't put the sub 54 clerics out of business.<br />
<br />

Sure you can rant, but make it clear, concise, and on even footing. The way this rant thread appears can easily be applied to the following: &quot;Groups want a 60 Druid over my 51 Cleric in groups for healing, please fix this!&quot;. Clearly demonstrate that at a similar level a Paladin will be more desired, and Verant may take heed.<br />
<br />
Paladins (by level 64) get Hero Bond, and Symbol of Marzin (did'nt check if their new Brell's stacks) for a whopping hp increase of:<br />
1100, AC by 58<br />
They also have extremely high casting cost heals for the size of their mana pool.<br />
<br />
Clerics (by level 64) get Virtue and Symbol of Khazad for a hp increase of:<br />
2350, AC by 72<br />
<br />
I for one refused to buy the stupid hammer and all the other spells for that matter they are ghey beyond belief IMHO. <br />
<br />
The new heals are quite good, especially useful in numerous situations is the group Celestial Elixer. This can also be Mass Group Buffed. Why are these new spells &quot;ghey&quot;?<br />
<br />
But in the end if you want to melee more power to you... but realize if you take this as a &quot;fix&quot; VI will move on to another class. <br />

<br />
What exactly do you propose as a fix?<br />
<br />
Without showing facts, Verant will not act, AND everyone else will simply view as as whiners with exceedingly vague statements.</div></div><hr />
