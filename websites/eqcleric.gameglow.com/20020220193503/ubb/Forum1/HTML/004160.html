</FONT><HR>Well I'm not sure he ever had it, but then again I couldn't ever figure out what his exact job was.  Certainly doesn't seem to be PR.  Originally he was suppose to improve communication between everyone, but most people I know stopped listening to him a long time ago, as most of his replies are just completely baffling, inflammatory, or condescending.  But then again, most of his posts these days are replies to posts that are baffling, inflammatory or condescending, so I guess he's just working with limited material.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

But who trusts Gordon anymore?<P>Take the following that directly affects us...<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B>Because the classes aren't designed to be equal, but to be balanced. If they were equal they would be interchangable in many cases. As it is designed, you must often make a choice with what class you want to be near. If you are going up against something with really strong poison, you certainly want clerics around. For disease, you'll probably want to add a shaman. If you are looking for something a little more general purpose, there's the druid, with respectable DD, DOTs, healing, buffs, and ports. </B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Ok, this exemplifies why Gordon is a poor person to deal with. The role of the cleric is to heal and cure party members. We are given tools to do this. But there isn't a good reason why we should be denied one of the best cures in the game. We're not asking for something imbalancing, we're simply being asked for a tool to do our designated job. It's not like we're anywhere near as versatile as shamen or druids. No DoTs, snares, pets, SoW... what's it gonna kill them to give it to us? I mean I don't think people are gonna go "Darn, we really need a shaman to cure this disease in one shot because those clerics suck at it". What interchangability? Shamen are unique enough as it is. They don't need to usurp our role as primary healers and curers.<P>Yet Gordon has shot us down again. And this is a minor issue for us (just chain counteract disease). Rangers need major work and monks need their AC raised. Yet Gordon has deemed them closed. <P>And the new Whineplay doesn't help like we thought. Yes, there is very little in the way of flaming personally now but Verant knows who you are and if you say something they don't like BAM there goes your account. They can do it. It's their world.<P>What we need is more interaction with the people who really do work on this stuff. I love the inclusion of Rowyl. He's easy to deal with and gives straightforward answers. He is what CS Repping is about. I'd love to talk to the Live team about stuff. Yes, it will make their lives busier but if Verant really cares about their customers taking the extra time will pay off.<P>If you don't think that's a good idea consider the following... Sunmoon, from the EQ Rangers site, went to the most recent EQ gathering and talked to some people directly about ranger issues. They hadn't heard any of them from Gordon. It really leaves me to wonder sometimes just how many posts die in Gordon's office (like our recent issue).<P>The bottom line is I'm a programmer and when customers have a problem with my programs the last person they want to talk to is a PR guy. They wanna tell me what's wrong directly and know it's being fixed.<P>Verant needs to cut out the middle man here. Especially if they want to keep customers in the future... I know I won't buy SWOL if they have all stuff like Whineplay still routed through Gordon Wrinn.<P>My 2cp...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Vicar of Prexus<BR>Proud member of <A HREF="http://www.steel-wind.com" TARGET=_blank>The Steel Wind</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I can totally believe that crap about the Rangers, Boanerges.<P>For awhile, I read those boards thinking that Abashi was some sort of a middleman. We would ask him questions, he would go back to Verant, then he would reply. He would forward our concerns to the company. He was the bridge of communication.<P>Lately, I realized that this is a load of Rhino dung.<P>He is actually a human shield, placed out there, defect our questions & concerns back to us. All he does is put spin on it. <P><I>"This is the way it was intended to be"</I> He in NO way actually knows that this was how it was intended. What probably happened was some planner just forgot to put it in. He assumes that this is class balancing. <I>Shamans are better in this aspect. See, it all makes sence. Clerics were designed to be the masters of curing poison & Shamans the masters of curing disease.</I><P>The thing is, he actually believes his own crap.<P>But, it really isn't all his fault is it? I mean, here is a copy of the daily memo that Abashi is distributed with:<P><I>Gordon-<P>Today, people will be directing questions to you about concerns and problems they have with the game. We can't possibly make everyone 100% happy, so the people that complain must be the people that are going to be unhappy no matter what. Thus, there is nothing that says that the status quo isn't perfect.<P>Therefore, when people come to you, hoping to make their lives "easier" & address what they consider legitimate bugs & problems, tell them that this is the way things were intended to be & that they should try another class or learn to have fun the way we intended it.<P>We understand that you get a lot of negative posts about different aspects of the game. But remember, only a very insignificant few who are unhappy post negativly here. A large majority of people are actually happy with the game & actually playing it & have no time to post because of all their fun. Remember, no post = 100% content with the game. Thus, all negative posters are inherently wrong & generally unhappy people without any true concerns.<P>Have a good day, and let us know if any real concerns come up. HAHA. Just kidding.<P>Sincerely,<BR>VI staff</I><P>Ho hum. Sorry for the rant.<P>------------------<BR><B>Ladida Hohum<BR>Cleric of The Tribunal</B><BR><I>Good Times!</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You know, I am actually pretty happy with Abashi. Is he perfect or the best, no. But then again, he freely admits he is an amateur stepping into a professionals job.<P>He admits when he makes mistakes and we and getting more information than we did pre-Abashi. Those two things in my opinion far outweigh the bad.<P>Does he overpromise. Yes, but not as much as he did in the beginning. A lot of his effectiveness also deals with how much power he has in the organization and how much attention people actually pay to him. <P>If sales are going up/remaining steady and your company is the big dog on the block, it is easy to ignore your PR guy who is telling folks 'we have a problem' or 'whats the answer to this', when you don't know for sure there is a problem (i.e. how is it reflected in a way that impacts ROI) or have the next batch of code to get done.<P>Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think that Abashi:<P>1) Has an impossible job.<P>2) Tries very hard to do said job.<P>3) Often dismisses people's carefully thought out issues too easily.<P>4) Fails to demand accountability and improvement on behalf of players for continued inexcusably shoddy quality assurance (i.e. testing of changes or existing features) by Verant.<P>5) Has developed the acute tunnel vision that comes from being too close to a situation for too long.<P>I don't think it's fair to criticize without advancing a solution, so here's mine. Abashi's job needs to be handled by a staff of people, say 10 or so to begin with, who are responsible for accounting for each and every thread on Whineplay. New threads would accumulate in a shared queue from which the mini-Abashis would take ownership of them on a first-come, first-served basis, then categorize them. Some threads are incoherent, whiny, or offensive, and should be categorized under "No Response". Some have already been answered and could be categorized under "FAQ", perhaps resulting in an auto-reply to the thread indicating that the answer can be found by reviewing the FAQ.  The rest would comprise the "Response Required" threads. It would be the responsibility of these individuals to communicate with the appropriate parties, to test the issue themselves when possible, to formulate a truly responsive reply taking into account both the player's perspective and Verant's original intention or worldview related to the matter at hand, and finally to update the FAQ with their conclusions to allow future inquiries along the same lines to be referred there.<P>Hey, I can dream...<p>[This message has been edited by Walbort (edited 09-14-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The one thing i think that really comes across strongly from his posts is that he has no real appreciation of the nature of the game at high levels (insert 'any levels' actually) and therefore fails to understand some of the problems & gripes that the player base has to deal with day to day.<P>I know he plays a supposedly high lv necro, but by god you wouldnt think it.  He just comes across as someone who has soloed a lot,  is not familiar with the difficulty of obtaining & balancing groups, or the time it takes to organise for some Kunark dungeons & find *necessary* classes like Enchanters, Clerics, Rogues if you want to broach certain areas.<P>To tell people that Enchanters are not a necessity and other classes can manage well.....go forth and try that in Sebilis etc and see where it gets you.  To suggest that if you dont have a rogue then you can 'choose' not to do that dungeon then.....well i could go on forever.<P>He has no appreciation of what it's really like on the ground, in the thick of the battlefield anymore, and is wildly out of touch with the player base.<P>The whole shebang bombed when Brad left the Live team, you've only got to see Brads recent posts (in many of which he directly contradicts Abashis) to see how bad things have really got.<P>Aunoa.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ok, Xtyras, the last line of your post troubles me...<P>I wouldnt EVER say a person needs to lose their job ESPECIALLY someone like Abashi..<P>So here is something I think ALL of us shoudl take into consideration... note, I am not DEFENDING or SLAMMING Verant in any way, I am just asking that all of us step back a second and take in a lot of different factors before we go off on Abashi/Verant.....<P>I got into a very large discussion about this at work today, (lots of EQ'ers at my office) and what we would like to know is the answers to the above questions...<P>Here are a few Questions/rebuttals we had...<P>1. Why do they fix inane bugs, when serious gameplay bugs are about? <P>Answer: There is a large possibility when during the code review for the large bug, they stumbled over this one... (this happens in the corporate world a LOT)<P>2. Do they have a dedicated Dev team/SWAT team/customer response team? or is it all a BASE code team?  <P>Reason: If there is only a BASE team, then chances are they are tasked with Velious and other advances more often than bug fixes... (read: Money.. it's all about money guys)<P>3. Why does Abashi give people the run around or stonewall?<P>Answer: (from my post on the BBane Inn) Take the amount of complaints, valid or not, and the amount of players in EQ... now compound this with a PR guy who isnt a code guy, and most likely only gets his info from others... (in all my dealings with Product managers (aka PR), they are ALWAYS out of the loop, and have to do a lot of backpedaling... (I work with 32 versions/products at a company... I see this all too often)) <P>4. Why do they allow large bugs etc go on for so long? <P>Answer: unknown.. but see above to the whole dev team answer... depending on amount of people, it may just take a while...<BR><P>------------------<BR>-Seliris Caileadair<BR>High Cleric of Clachan Brigh<BR>52nd Rank Vicar<BR>Bristlebane Server<BR>*I dont get angry at the game, just the people playing it*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hear, hear, Seliris!<P>/rant on<P>Most people complaining about bugs, fixes, nerfs etc. quite clearly have never worked on a large software project and it is dubtful that they even have the remotest idea what it takes to pull off the feat which Verant has done. Having dozens of "servers" running 24 hour a day with a dynamic environment which is entertaining enough to keep 200,000+ people coming back on a near dayly basis for over a year. Try it yourself and you will see that Verant in fact are doing a very good job.<P>Now, I recommend that you lay off on the personal attacks. They do not belong in this kind of disussion and they certainly do not improve Everquest in any way. I also think that you vastly underestimate Verant if you think that Gordon has that much to say about how things are implemented in the game. Customer feedback is very important, but Verant has clearly shown that design integrity is very very important to them. And you should be very glad that this is the case. If they would have implemented every little "improvement suggestion" which comes their way, we would all have stopped playing this game a long time ago.<P>Sure, even Verant has stuff that needs to be worked on and improved. But tell me a company which is producing something worthwile which doesn't? <P>In fact everything in Everquest has improved over the 12 months which I have played it, it continues to get better and this includes having Gordon around. It was not that good without him.<P>Go back to the game, enjoy it and if it isn't fun, stop complaining and MAKE it fun. Ever created quests for lower levels? Done architecure visits to Mistmoore? Raided Oggok? There is lots of fun if you just stop complaining and see the good things in Everquest.<P>/rant off<BR><P>------------------<BR>Naxy Dent, Cleric of Karana on Bristlebane<BR>while (dead_horse) beat();</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A)I think people overestimate Abashi's influence greatly. Seems obvious to me no important balance and gameplay decisions are made without careful discussion amongst a team of people, a team of which Abashi wasn't even a part of until months after release. This the reason why it took so long for Rangers to be fixed. Sure Abashi might dismiss things out of hand, but from what I've seen its usually only when the answer that the EQ team would return is clear and/or well known (IE hybrid exp, melee binding). There's no point in going back to the team on certain issues when you know what they are going to say. Whether or not you agree with Verant's stance on these issues, I don't think Abashi has enough influence to change Verant's mind on certain things no matter how much he tried.<P>B)He's been getting constantly flamed and ridiculed for a long time. I think its perfectly within his right to say "I will not even respond to you if you insult me or my coworkers." This is the only thing that I've noticed lately that is significantly different from what he used to do. If it were me, my only response would be "*(#@ off"<P>C)He communicates completely in text. Think about this. So much is lost when the only medium you can communicate in is with tiny little symbol. What is lost is replaced in the reader's own mind. If you have developed a mental image of Abashi as a condescending prick, everything he says will re-inforce that perception you have. It doesn't matter if Abashi's job started being handled by Mother Theresa, you'd still interpret his replies as rude and arrogant.<P>Slightly off topic: I often hear people criticize Verant saying they don't communicate with the players. Name one decent size company, anywhere, ever, in this industry or any other industry on the planet that has that communicates with its consumer base as much as Verant does. Have you ever had a discussion with McDonald's top brass about the recipe for their Big Mac? How many times has some top exec from Chevy ever gone to a message board and started a thread on ideas to improve their product? Only thing I can think of is maybe some other companies developing MMORPG's, of course its easy to do this when all you have to talk about is promises and potential without substance.<P>One more thing I'd like to ad:<BR>"The guy is human after all, and I have never read a post of his I couldnt at least see the point in, if not totally agree." <BR>                          -Seliris<P>Damn straight Seliris.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Shyloc Starsgard:<BR>[B]A)I think people overestimate Abashi's influence greatly. Seems obvious to me no important balance and gameplay decisions are made without careful discussion amongst a team of people, a team of which Abashi wasn't even a part of until months after release<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Agreed, but the entire Ranger issue was so blatantly obvious to all the players that in my opinion he should have been championing them hard.  I don't know that he wasn't, but it sure seems like he wasn't.  Furthermore, in my opinion Brad cut the legs out from under Gordon with his post on the Ranger upgrade.  It lessens a subordinate any time a superior comes in and overrules.  <P><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>B)He's been getting constantly flamed and ridiculed for a long time. I think its perfectly within his right to say "I will not even respond to you if you insult me or my coworkers." This is the only thing that I've noticed lately that is significantly different from what he used to do. If it were me, my only response would be "*(#@ off"<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Yea, he gets flamed a lot, most of it is inexcusable, yet he still appears to be losing it.  Banning that person for a pretty benign post on Whineplay (and later reversing it) shows that Abashi's patience is stretched pretty thin.  Ban a person from the boards, sure.  Ban them from the game over a post on the boards?  No.  Bad precedent.<P>One other thing that bothers me:  the tone of the message threating a one day suspension over people recruiting for guildmates on the chat channel (however demeaning that is to the player) is WAY out of line.  I feel it shows a lot of contempt for the player base.  And I think Gordon wrote it.

</FONT><HR>To ban people from a online game is wrong and prolly NOT legal, The user have paid money for a product and if the manufacture wants to take back the product the they have to: <P>First : Ask the user if he wants to give it back . (remember that the user have paid for the product)<P>second : Pay the user back the money spent on purchesing the product before the product is given back.<P>This means the because that EQ is a game that you can only play online, Verant can NOT Ban users from playing EQ without giving back the users money .<P>If you could play it offline then Verant  MIGHT be able to ban users from their networks, (not realy sure about this part because the EQ game info stats that it is a game that users can play online, and if verant changes it so that users can't play online any more then it is something wrong with the product they sold and they have to take it back and reimburse (think it is called reimbursed) the users.<P>So Verant or any people from verant are WRONG to ban people. <P>If I was ever baned from eq for any reason I would contact my company lawyer and have him pay verant a visit.<P>Whats wrong with the world when u can't express you opinion about a product that you have paid for.

</FONT><HR>Having read through some of the other posts here about the difficulty of his job (which i dont doubt) and the troubles of tracking & changing bugs, fixes etc.....these are all well and true, but as Rayne says, his attitude and the way in which he deals with things has really gone down hill.<P>It is bad enough that a serious bug (say, spells not dropping) doesnt get fixed for weeks on end - fine, blame it on the troubles of running such a large project - what bothers me is seeing the PR guy go:<P>There is nothing wrong with spell drops<BR>There is nothing wrong with spell drops<BR>There is nothing wrong with spell drops<BR>There is nothing wrong with spell drops<BR>Oh wait a minute yes there is.<P>And this from the PR guy, who is meant to be our point of contact with Verant & dealer of information.  How can he stand there and fight a one man battle against the entire 50+ player base saying spells drops are kerplunked.  This is why i say he's out of touch.<P>How tiring has it been to see Monks crusading and being fobbed off for weeks on end over ac & the weight of their weapons, to see veiled threats about feign & /q, and then now, probably a good 6 weeks on, monks get a strength boost to help with their high end weapons.  I mean, argggggggh!  There's a pattern of ignoring, then saying there's nothing wrong, then getting sarcastic over the issue, then burying it, then correcting it a month down the line.  All this serves to do is undermine himself.<P>If he cannot give accurate information first time around, he shouldnt be giving it at all until he's sure of it.<P>Otherwise, what the hell is the point of having him if he (a)does not, or will not listen to genuine problems and complaints, and (b)wholly fails to appreciate them when he does finally take notice, or (c)fire off some canned response designed to close the topic and then it takes a couple more weeks worth of people ranting before he gets the point.<P>Yes yes yes, i realise he is probably terribly resticted by the upper echelons of Verant, but does this make it alright?  We just put up with this?<P>Aunoa.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I like abashi in general, we get alot more information (alot of it accurate) that we do not get any other way.<P>He doesn't always get things right, like the spell drop thing but he is not a tester.  He gets a request like that he would go to the programmers and testers and say oye is this working.  They would probably in their arrogance (alot of programmers believe that any code they do is perfect) said yes without bothering to check and so he responded yup they are as intended. <P>If people seriously believe that he is to test everything yourself you are very much mistaken. <P>That said he probably does need a holiday the poor bloke.  Customer service people in general try not to let their irritation show through to their job but they are only human, people will get snappy for the silliest things, and if the same moron keeps asking for you to fix the same thing that you can not do, then it really does take an inhuman effort not to scream at them.<P>Regarding people who get banned on the boards get banned in the game.  I think it is fair, people go into writing their with their eyes wide open, they know what is proper conduct.  Should they get banned in game? well the point is are these the people you really want as your customers in an environment where customers interact.  Do you want one moron who you know is a moron due to their own actions on boards to interact and upset other customers that you actually would like to retain?<P>Abashi is the focal point of agression for upto 300k people.  Whilst a vast majority people who play enjoy the game everyone has a gripe from time to time.  Much to players distress he is not the fountain of all knowledge that is expected of him, he can not retain knowledge of every quest, every race combination and what armour they can wear, faction adjustments, spells combination with mobs cast on, level of user, class of user, level of mob they were cast on, what the mob drops.  There are so many angles and people on the whole expect too much.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

I am sure they could recount numerous occasions.<P>The problem is that Abashi is trying to do more than one person can handle and is dealing with almost an untenable situation. <P>To do his job effectively he needs to triage some requests and complaints. Yet those he triages have other outlets that they can use to make their points heard. Even when he says 'We have already commented on that and the issue is closed' he still has to spend cycles on those issues.<P>He is not going to make everyone happy.

You don't put someone who knows nothing about PR out there as front line contact to your entire customer base.

</FONT><HR>A few thoughts:<P>1.  I don't think that the volume of complaints on the message boards can be attributed to Abashi (or anyone else at Verant) doing a bad job.  Given any large group of people, a certain fraction of them are always going to complain.  If 1% of EQ players are whiny jerks, that's still 2,000 people to show up and spam the message boards.  I'm not saying there aren't legitimate complaints, but realistically, a certain amount of ranting is just a given.<P>2.  I think people have unrealistic expectations about getting changes in the game.  The game didn't come out of a vacuum.  It's clear to me from every post I've ever seen by a Verant rep that they truly like their game and have strong feelings about it.  I'd bet that nearly every significant aspect of the game reflects a conscious, thought-out decision by a game designer.  Their decision could be wrong, but they have a reason for it (good or bad), and they're not going to make a change every time Abashi tells them that some people on the message boards don't like what they did.<P>3.  In a similar vein, I think of lot of posters "shoot the messenger" when they hear things they don't like.  My class isn't getting better armor/spells/whatever?  Damn that Abashi!  I doubt that any big decisions are made by Abashi alone, and I doubt that replacing Abashi would effect any noticeable change in Verant's positions on the "hot topics."  People love Rowyll and Ester the Tester, but they have limited areas of responsibility that usually don't touch on class balance, loot drops, etc.  Put Rowyll in charge of explaining why monks don't have higher AC, and the honeymoon will be over quickly.<P>4.  On the "censorship issue," I did disagree with the recent incident where someone got a warning for saying "Abashi doesn't count."  Aside from that, however, I have yet to see any instance where someone was punished for politely stating an opinion about a game issue.  Despite the overheated "Big Brother" rhetoric, Verant has done nothing more than adopt that same sorts of policies that all the good unofficial boards use (including this one).<P>5.  Finally, Abashi has seemed a little short-tempered recently.  I try to bear in mind, however, how I would feel if I was sitting at home answering questions in my free time, and I came across the twentieth "you're an idiot" message of the day.<P>Aquinas<BR>36th level Cleric of Lanys T'Vyl<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

He gets a request like that he would go to the programmers and testers and say oye is this working.

Lemme go check" on everything. I don't expect 100% accuracy. What I resent is that, in the case of spell drops, he began to call us liars, implied that maybe uberguilds were hogging them all (totally untrue) and, perhaps the biggest insult of all... implied we didn't need our non-vendor 51+ spells to enjoy 50+ life. <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1604" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=1604</A> <P>And yes, he himself finally tested the spell drops and, almost sheepishly, admitted that they were broken.<P>Getting something as important as spell drops fixed should NOT require several months of screaming at Gordon.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B><BR>That said he probably does need a holiday the poor bloke.  Customer service people in general try not to let their irritation show through to their job but they are only human, people will get snappy for the silliest things, and if the same moron keeps asking for you to fix the same thing that you can not do, then it really does take an inhuman effort not to scream at them.<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>If it's something like, say, multigroup events I'll buy the argument that the client simply won't support it.<P>But what exactly do you tell monks whose planes armor is worse than some stuff newbies wear? Should monks just say "We don't deserve higher AC" and just give up? Should rangers, who have been handed nothing but excuses, just give up on getting fixed? If Verant would admit that the hate list is the cause of the problem and simply say "We can't change this" I would accept that. But no. Gordon chooses the stonewall route every time. "Rangers are balanced as-is. There are no problems with the class."<P>It's not the PR stuff that gets most, it's the constant ignorance. Do I need to remind you of the "Battle cleric" comment? Not to mention that it's Gordon himself who has lead to the catchphrase "Broken as intended". It looks like a cop-out and it probably is. <P>Take Kunark bugged hatelists. Gordon early on said that he suspected that it was an error in the radius of the mobs so they could "yell" for help in a huge radius. More recently he said it was a "feature" of Kunark and we just need to live with the fact that if you kill a bunch or critters in an area you will get huge agro radius and random faction hits. You can't say this was intended tho because it doesn't work that way in the old world.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B><BR>Regarding people who get banned on the boards get banned in the game.  I think it is fair, people go into writing their with their eyes wide open, they know what is proper conduct.  Should they get banned in game? well the point is are these the people you really want as your customers in an environment where customers interact.  Do you want one moron who you know is a moron due to their own actions on boards to interact and upset other customers that you actually would like to retain?<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>To a certain extent I like some of the new policies. The ability to boot people who are disruptive is beneficial. But Verant has made a set of very subjective rules and, pretty much, if they want to ban you they can. And contrary to Advert's view, Verant can and will, if given reason, ban you. You can't get a refund, you can't sue them, you can only complain. I haven't read the TOS with a fine tooth comb but I highly doubt Sony hasn't placed some sort of legal terminology in there that gives them the right to arbitrarily ban you without reason.<P>Now, what if you simply say "Verant is foolish for not listening to their customers" on the main EQ boards... that can be construed as an attack on the company and they could ban you over it. Probably wouldn't for something that small but they have already banned people for saying things they didn't like. Censorship at its finest. And 100% legal.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B><BR>Abashi is the focal point of agression for upto 300k people.  Whilst a vast majority people who play enjoy the game everyone has a gripe from time to time.  Much to players distress he is not the fountain of all knowledge that is expected of him, he can not retain knowledge of every quest, every race combination and what armour they can wear, faction adjustments, spells combination with mobs cast on, level of user, class of user, level of mob they were cast on, what the mob drops.  There are so many angles and people on the whole expect too much.<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I don't expect Gordon to know every detail of EQ. But I don't want him to arbitrarily dismiss legitimate concerns either. And that's what I keep seeing. We got told that we don't need Abolish Disease because it would intrude upon the uniqueness of shamen. Never mind that shamen already get numerous spells we don't and fill a vastly different role and that we are primary healers while they are not. I don't think he even considered it. And as a customer it makes me mad.<P>This isn't about "We hate Gordon" it's about "We want better customer service. We want to be heard on legitimate issues." And, simply put, one man servicing 200k customers isn't good business. Especially when that man demonstrates time and time again that he knows very little about what he is representing. I want to talk to the dev teams and the Live team directly. I wanna hear from the guy working on spells why we don't deserve Abolish Disease. I wanna hear from the melee guy why Ranger's aren't broken. I wanna hear from the zone dev guy why stuff in Kunark needs to agro half a zone away and give me faction hits for mobs I never even laid eyes on.<P>I am tired of the runaround.

</FONT><HR>I honestly believe he needs a few more people helping him do his job. It seems he misinterprets many requests or comments and could have a more open mind about some issues, the abolish disease in particular.<P>What bugs me the most is his attitude. It is mostly adverserial and on the civil side of snooty. Abashi seems to believe all the players are out to get an easy time of it with little effort. I could be wrong but that certainly isn't what I see for the most part. My favorite was the cleric quest armor.<P>Clerics: "Hey, these armor quests take forever to complete"<BR>Abashi: "Not broken, as intended"<BR>Clerics: "No, really it's broken"<BR>Abashi:"Oh hush, it's perfectly fine"<BR>Clerics: "We're pretty sure this isn't what you intended"<BR>Abashi: "Ok fine, I'll take a look at it"<BR>Clerics wait 8 months for a response....<BR>Abashi: "We've noticed that the cleric armor quests aren't working as intended and we will be changing them in the next patch"<P><BR>And when the requests for skills for rangers or AC for monks are denied, one of the common rationales is "Well, we have 14 bijillion subscribers and have sold 20 skillion boxes so we must be right." That is resigning yourself to mediocrity, accepting the good as opposed to striving for the best. I guess we're all guilty of that, but for someone in his particular job he should try to open his mind a little bit.<P>------------------<BR>Derenath Enikinteel [Emef'Aitch]<BR>50 Dwarven Cleric<BR>The Rathe<BR>-=Bah yer na' 'urt, walk it off =-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

What most likely happens is that he performs his stalling/threatening routine until one of his bosses tells him otherwise. That of course only happens when they believe they will lose a good number of subscribers, or already have, over an issue.<P>Sure there are a lot of natural whiners, but this guy gets down and dirty and plays on their level rather than rising above the preadolescent behavior. Then he moves on to treat rational well-stated adults in the same manner, earning much of the hostility towards him.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well working in a similar job as Gordon I can understand why he gets fustrated at times and also seems like he contridicts himself.<P>Someone hit the nail on the head, he doent test anything.  Joe whinny on the boards sais that this doesnt work.  Gordon asked the team to test it. They do and tell him it works.  He tells Joe that it does work and is fine.  Joe screams and calls Gordon a %^&*&#!<P>If you want to experience his job then go your local bar and wait until 2 drunk brutes start to fight, then go on over and break it up in a rational manner.  Then head to your local emergency room.<P>Yes there are things that YOU feel need to be changed in the game.  The are not always what the programmers and managers of EQ want to allocate resources to, or even change at all.  Our cleric quests were never broken, they took a long time to do but you could do them all.  Yes the vision changes everyday and will continue to, what Verant feels is a fair amount of risk, Spawn time and so on will be different from month to month.<P>How many of you act this way with other products you buy?  Do you ask BK to put a different kind of cheese on your burger and then get mad when they wont.  Do you then continue to go back every day and get another burger and yell at the drive-thru attendant that your burger is still not fixed.<P>I'm sorry I wont defend Gordons every move but for goodness sake give the man a break.  Why is it that in this day and age where the world is our oyster, some would rather stay put and be mad, dissapointed and complain, rather than finding another game they like better.<P>Can we please move this to the rant section or close this tread all together.  If this thread was about any of us it would of been locked ages ago.<P><BR>*the above views are from a customer support manager who has solved too many problems this frady afternoon that could of been solved by reading the manual or using the product the way it was intended, pleas forgive him for being so abrasive  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Sigh.<P>I hardly even keep up with his posts any more.  Why?  Because I'd rather spend the time playing the game.  It's all about Entertainment Value Units (EVUs).  Whatever you get your kicks from is just fine.  <BR>Personally, I think some good things have come from all the whining on the boards.  But how many players actually post there?  I used to check there until I realized it was all the same people over and over.<P>And then you have to consider all the bull#### that has come from the whineplay boards.  What the deal is with this?  How many positive enhancements can they make to this game before it becomes so easy as to be pointless?  There was a challenge level that they set in developing the zones, and all these "improvements" are screwing with that.<P>Gordon serves his purpose.  He keeps those who are interesting in whining not happy but "contented."  For some people, it's enough just to get a response.  Of course, this leaves a lot of the real problems out of the spotlight.  The game (and Gordon) would be served better if all legitmate claims were made on the boards.  But legitmate claim-makers are usually the same people who can't sit around all-day long BUMPing their posts to the top just so they can feel a little bit of a confidence-boost.<P>I know at this point I am wasting my time ranting.  But I just have to say this.  Who the hell cares?  This game is a helluva lot better now than it was at release.  And the improvements that were made are a small percantage of the actual "whines" that are posted.<P>Sigh.  I've gone so long as to babble.  I just think people should "let go" sometimes.  The game is great, all classes ARE balanced, and the only thing left to improve on are trade-skills (just about to be done), quests (not seen too much of this), and more zones (About to be done with SoV).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Abashi has NOT improved communication one bit since his placement as PR guy.  In the olden days we were hearing things straight from Brad, Geoff Zatkin, and John Smedley, the people who actually have a clue.  Now we're getting information of a highly suspect nature from Abashi instead.  While he talks a whole lot more than they did, 90% of what he says is, "No, we won't do that."  In terms of static/noise ratio, we've gotten the short end of the stick of late.<BR>It was mentioned in one of the posts referenced in a Castersrealm news article that while Abashi said he was there to represent us, he is in fact representing them.  That's the truth of the matter in one sentence, he's not championing the little guy, he's giving the little guy someone to yell at so the rest of the company doesn't have to listen to it.  Funny how nothing gets accomplished that way, isn't it?<BR>VI doesn't listen now, they didn't listen then.  It took them a year to realize that mage pets weren't dual-wielding.  It took them a year to realize that shamans weren't getting alchemy correctly.  It took them considerably more than a year to fix poison.  From day one players were clamoring about those huge problems, were verant truly listening to a word we said, those flaws would not have persisted as long as they did.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Katandon, and the others who remarked about the non-refundability of your service charge.<P>I am defintely no consumer rights advocate, however I would point out that you do license the software, however the service (ability to log into a server) is just that a service not software.  <P>I've had opportunity to become familiar with the requirements of a company with respect to extended service policies offered on consumer electronics.  Because it is a service paid for in advance, cancellation of service requires reimbursement.  If a customer cancels a service policy they are entitled to a prorated refund by law, how is that different from the service VI Provides.  <BR>   <BR>   Anyone know a consumer advocate willing to file a class action law suit pro bono on behalf of the users of EverQuest(tm), who like me canceled their accounts and stopped playing without receiving anything for the money they paid.  Personally I decided that I did not have the time to play and needed a break, however over a month of service remained on my account that I did not use.  That's a service paid for that I received no value for, and there was no way for me to preserve that value, either by refund, or suspended account where the paid for service was held for a later date.  Is it really legal or is no one willing/able to pursue the legal avenues for fair treatment?<P>I don't know,<BR>Atro Demerzel, former Cleric on the Tribunal<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Atro (edited 09-18-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/004160-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/004160-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004160&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004160&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
