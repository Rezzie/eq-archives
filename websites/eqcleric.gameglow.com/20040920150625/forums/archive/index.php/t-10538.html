To the left of the docks is a good place to sit. You have six named sisters that spawn fast. Two man team, me and a necro/with his pet. Can clear sisters two at a time. One on the dock, one by the tree, two in the vendor shack, and two on the shack the farthest back. All con blue up to around 35 i believe. It is possible but a little hard to solo them. Not only good exp that is safe if you are grouped, but they drop up to 2pp i have seen and two of the sisters have a sword that can be sold for 11pp. So you figure each person takes a round of loot (which consists of all six sisters) you have two swords, and six purity belts. Approximately 30pp. If its two of you, figure on two rounds each an hour. so in an hour you can feasibly make 60pp and close to a bubble of experience.<br />
