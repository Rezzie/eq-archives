<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenobe</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well 2 weeks ago I was in a rut.  I was not having much fun playing my cleric of 42 seasons.  I was in OT and was playing the stun, heal, buff game.  I found I was loggin in my alt more and more.  The problem I had, was group dependency.  I hadn't soloed since level 34 and I rarely traveled alone without SoW and or invis.  So I got a nice buffer into 42 and decide to try something new, on my own.<br />
<br />
I ran around the Frontier mountains by myself with no SoW.  I learned the art of root/atone, root/run, fear/root/run, fear/ run and many other ways to save thy own arse.  Then I went back to the mainland for a bit. I hit MM and Kith with some guildmates and while running back to BB to get the boat I saw a gnome magician who snarled at me.  Hmm, blue to a 42 I buffed upped and mememed all my stuns.  I rooted the pet and stun/nuked my foe to death.  Now some may say that camping spawns is boring, but every fight ended up with me less than half health and Lom.  A couple times I was at the zone edge praying to Marr that my nuke or heal would land before hers  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Level 43 wasn't much easier but the xp was all mine from the kill and knowing that each fight had a darn good chance to end me was very thrilling. I only lost 2 fights, one I zoned with 25 hps and the other I didn't make it.<br />
<br />
This all ended in me getting 44 and my new spells. This had to be the best level for spells I have ever had. 39 was nice but not as nice as the 44 buffs and nukes that are worthy of group play (500 pt nuke at my level is worthy).  This was really a level full of spells for &quot;me&quot;, they do help the party, but extend my options to solo or get offensive in groups a lot farther than ever before.  I went back to that gnome with the new spells but after 2 nukes she was dead and I got too bored  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
So the point is?<br />
<br />
Life IS what you focus on.  If you have a bad morning and focus on that all day it will never get better.  Same with EQ if you focus on the things that suck, EQ will suck.  This is not to say you cant try to get your cleric improvements, I am all for that.  Why I wanted to share this story is because you may not always be able to get loot or xp, but Fun and challanges are out there for whomever wishes to seek them.<br />
<br />
Enjoy your cleric! this board is a great resource that will help you do just that. My helm off to thoes that moderate and post here in a productive way.  If I could not share and learn here, there would be one less cleric in Norath.<br />

<br />
I recently made 44 myself, and I love my spells also, especially when hunting stuff in the BW  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
I was in that same rut myself when I hit 40 for the first time.  I thought to myself, &quot;there's no point to any of this!&quot; and was considering quitting EQ altogether.  So I took a break and came back about 2 wks later with a new outlook.  Thought to myself, what the hey, this is a game and games are meant to be fun.  Who cares if I don't have the &quot;phat lewt&quot; or I'm not level 60.  Who cares if Lower Guk or Sol B is too crowded, I'll just go somewhere else.  Who cares if someone is camping the quest armor, I'll just do another quest.<br />
<br />
Eq is what you make it.  If you make it fun, then it WILL be fun, not just for yourself, but for your friends, groups, and guilds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True enough! Sometimes a break from the usual is just so nice.  My level 45 druid took a long sojourn in Sol A looking for Molten Cloaks for herself and me.  Only found one, but did get a platinum armband without too much fuss!<br />
<br />
I normally don't camp anything, since I hate camping, but this was a real break in the routine to go into a nice dungeon like SolA. Become familiar with it, find all those secret passages.  I can't wait to come back to this dungeon with a group that can get experience here.<br />
<br />
So, it was actually quite a pleasant change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aarich</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that 44 is the best level for spells as a cleric.  (res at 49 is nice, but it seems to add a bit of work to you rather than make your job easier like the 44 ones do)<br />
<br />
You essentially get new vastly upgraded forms of the spells cleric's use most.  Retribution - finally a DD with a reasonable efficiency.  Resolution - makes valor look puny.  Resist Magic - nicer duration than EM and 20 more resist.  Naltron - welcome to the peridot addiction.  The addition of Nalt and reso finally make complete heal actually an efficient prospect as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree!  Thanks for a wonderful post.  I too was about to quit not too long ago.  I had more fun playing my bard (no rez requests, no people yelling HEAL!!!!) and so I ignored Sals for quite a while.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
But then something cool happened - I had one truly great night, where things went smoothly, everyone showed up on time, there were almost no deaths, and my friends and I were laughing and working as a team again.  I started playing Sal again, and I'm really glad I did.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Kenobe.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
I have also come along this time where i felt i was just simply tired of this class. Knowing i had to wait for hours on a list in Sol B, and Lower Guk. It got to teh point where the camps were boring and i couldn't stand waiting for hours to get a group.<br />
<br />
Luckily Kunark came along and gave us new places to go hunt. Where the higher levels can actually find a pick up group if they need one. Also many opportunities for soloing appeared.<br />
<br />
Im glad ya stayed on man, the server always needs another good cleric.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
