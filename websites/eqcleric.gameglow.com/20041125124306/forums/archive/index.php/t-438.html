<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juul</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was discussing this with a gaming friend of mine, and I tried to explain how Verant put the &quot;quest&quot; in EverQuest.  Trying to explain something like the Fiery Avenger to an uniniated person is like speaking Middle English to an Incan.  It just don't work.  Anyway, in an effort to try to explain how quests work, I made up a little multiple choice quest creation guide.  Yes, the tongue was firmly in the cheek whilst writing - enjoy =)<br />
(This would look far better as a web form with drop downs, but I'm faaaaaaaaar too lazy to do that much work.  If you want to, go for it... just post a url so I can see it.  Additions and edits are welcome and expected.)<br />
<br />
1.) Your quest is for:<br />
a.) Paladins<br />
b.) Clerics<br />
c.) Necromancers<br />
d.) Rangers<br />
e.) Warriors<br />
f.) Shadow Knights<br />
g.) Monks<br />
h.) Rogues<br />
i.) Shamen<br />
j.) Enchanters<br />
k.) Mages<br />
l.) Necromancer pets<br />
<br />
2.) Your quest begins in:<br />
a.) Kerra Ridge<br />
b.) the Mino Caves of Steamfont.<br />
c.) Neriak 3rd gate, in the fountain.<br />
d.) the Frogluk King’s Throne Room.<br />
e.) Halas, somewhere in the lake.<br />
f.) the hole above Nagafen’s Lair.<br />
<br />
3.) Your quest-giver NPC:<br />
a.) is immediately killed on sight by the mobs he spawns near.<br />
b.) only spawns when the third moon of Jupiter is aligned with Haley’s Comet and the 3rd star of Orion’s belt.<br />
c.) drops an earring that’s +10str +10sta +10dex +20ac and has a better haste effect than the Cloak of Flames.<br />
d.) is regularly killed by level 1 characters because he’s that easy.<br />
e.) all of the above.<br />
<br />
4.) Your quest requires:<br />
a.) an assault force larger than the D-day attack.<br />
b.) an earring that’s +10str +10sta +10dex +20ac and has a haste effect better than Cloak of Flames.<br />
c.) two rare drops from dragons, a long camp in the middle of the ocean, serious faction work (or cooperation with others whom you trust), a weapon you are currently using, and a trip to the Plane of Air.<br />
d.) several week long camps in obscure corners of the world that can’t be reached by a nearby teleporter.<br />
e.) a well balanced party of 6 people to all move in the same direction at the same time without anyone asking why, informing you that they need Spirit of Wolf, or saying “OOM”.<br />
f.) Aradune to show up personally and ask what you think he should do to make the game more fun for everyone.<br />
g.) Abashi to swear on every message board in existance that Alchemy is indeed not broken, and Rangers are balanced, by god!<br />
<br />
5.) Your quest reward:<br />
a.) is unimplemented at this time, sorry but you won’t be reimbursed.<br />
b.) requires ungodly faction with a group who has no enemies for you to kill.<br />
c.) gives Intelligence to a cleric, Wisdom to a warrior, Charisma to a monk, and 1000 hitpoints to a Necromancer.<br />
d.) is a specially spawned mob named Abashi who has 30000 hitpoints, but hits like a giant bat.  This entertains your entire server for hours as people run up, smack him around for 10 minutes, then leave giggling to themselves.<br />
e.) has a right click effect of the level 56 Cleric resurrection spell, but only works on other people’s corpses.<br />
f.) is only available on e-Bay.<br />
g.) is restricted to a religion that no player character can choose.<br />
<br />
6.) Your quest was created by:<br />
a.) a room full of monkeys banging away on computers.<br />
b.) an underpaid, under appreciated, overly bitter Verant employee.<br />
c.) the guy who told Abashi that Rangers were balanced</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever you do, don't post this to the Druid's Grove!  Your list of classes in step 1 didn't mention them, showing why druids don't have quests.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Some additional possibilities...<br />
<br />
2) Your quest begins in:<br />
 g) Oasis, on Spectre Island<br />
 <br />
3) Your quest-giver NPC is:<br />
 f) Dyllin Starshine. (sp?)<br />
 g) Aradune.<br />
<br />
4)Your quest requires:<br />
 h) 92634 bone chips<br />
 i) a Plains Pebble (only for No-Drop items unusable by druids or rangers)<br />
 j) that you chop down the mightiest tree in the forest wiiiith... a herring! <br />
<br />
(herrings can be gotten by Master Fishers.  Yes they can.  You just haven't tried long enough - you can't expect to fish a Herring right away, every time.  We've checked the database, and they work.  They weren't exported correctly at first, but they will work now after this 8 MB patch.  Yes they do.  I went and stood behind one of our testers while he fished, and the quest works fine.  We have adjusted the Fishing rate of herrings, please let me know if anyone gets one.  I apologize for the delay in the implementation of this quest.  We have found it necessary to remove shrubbery from the game.  It has been replaced with A Fleshy Orb.)<br />
<br />
5) Your quest reward:<br />
 h) is a level 1 spell and 3 copper pieces.<br />
<br />
6) Your quest was created by:<br />
 d) a random number generator running against the EQ databases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Following your idea, I think another required quest item might have to be a coconut, found only on the ultra-rare Vellious Swallow.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
( seriously Juul, Monty Python AND the princess bride?...I gain more respect for you each and every time)</div></div><hr />
