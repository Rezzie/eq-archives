<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iphigenia</div><div class="date">08-19-2001, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I just did this.  We got to the 3rd wave and lost.  There were at least 10 groups there.   It was an absolutely blast, I'd really recommend everyone to get involved in one of these.<br />
<br />
I really had a feeling of being a combat medic.  Running from one battle to another trying to keep key people alive.  Trying to figure out where the hell my group was.  <br />
<br />
Anyone else done this?  Any tips or pointers for the next one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollwin</div><div class="date">08-22-2001, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had 2 main battle groups that consited of serveral 6 person groups.  Added to that we had 2 *kite* groups desigend to keep the giants busy while we each battle group picked off giants from the kite groups for the kill.  One group was also dedicated to command and control that oversaw the battle, kept an eye out for stray giants and the like.<br />
<br />
The hardest part was keeping the 2 battle groups seperate enough to reduce immediante area lag issues.<br />
<br />
Assist healing is a must for this fight as is battle ressing.  Members should know that if they die, a res will be coming right away, without being asked.<br />
<br />
Enchanters have to be ready to C2 any cleric that needs it the second it drops.  Mana has to keep flowing, the tanks and clerics are really what keep this fight rolling.  Getting the right amount of Shamans on slowing is pretty important to.<br />
<br />
Participants need to know who is responseable for what buffs and make sure they ask in tells, /say is to easy to get missed in battle spam.<br />
<br />
We made it to the last guy but just didn't have the tactics to take him down.  After our fights with Vindicator and the Statue, I'm pretty sure we will win the next time.<br />
<br />
It is the single most fun I have ever had in EQ, that fight is awsome.<br />

As a cleric the biggest issue I've had to deal with is agro.  Often you get 4-5 mobs at once, which can't be crowd controled by normal means.  After 1 heal, I'm tanking 3 and die.  A lot of off tanks really helps.  Put a warrior on each one of the pulls, while the group concentrates on 1 solves this problem...<br />
