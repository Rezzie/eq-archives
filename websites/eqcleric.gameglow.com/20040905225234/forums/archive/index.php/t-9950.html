<br />
=/<br />
<br />
I'd rather use the single-target buff then pay that much.<br />
<br />
Anyone aware of a good place to fight for these spells that take about 2 level 60 groups with ease?</div></div><hr />

We got a 55+ beastmaster spell last night!  oh and one of the other clerics in the guild got group aego.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think anyone would like it if warriors began to boycott buying weapons. Warriors have to buy weapons, so we should have to buy some spells.<br />
<br />
With that said, no spell is worth 50k. That is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulweaver</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I said in another post, if people are willing to pay it, then people will charge the price. <br />
<br />
Dont pay the high price now and they might be cheaper some time down the road. I never buy spells if I can help it, and I woudl never pay such a high price for something like that.<br />
<br />
Lets face it clerics have to buy all the same things as a warrior, plate armour, shields, etc etc (although not so many weapons I admit) and have spells in addition. We are in our early years especially a very low spare cash class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least warriors can sell their weapons when they get better.<br />
Our spells gets stuck at page 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josiefuz</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't buy any of these for the first month.  Prices will stabilize after there are a bunch of these around and fewer clerics need them.  Only level 60 clerics can cast them after all, and there aren't *that* many level 55+ clerics on the server.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinskey Bab0linskey</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, maybe on your server there aren't that many high levels.  The Nameless is crawling with 55+ clerics... but it is a den'of unscrupolus power gamers.<br />
<br />
I agree though, I've never bought a spell from a player, never will.  It works out well for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shrug, emmisary of thule (59 Nec pet spell) goes for 30k+ regularly.  If people will pay it, thats what it goes for.<br />
<br />
That being said, if u don't really need a spell that bad, group and hope it drops, or wait a few months.<br />
