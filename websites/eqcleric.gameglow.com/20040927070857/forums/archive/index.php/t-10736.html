<br />
I've managed to get myself through the cave and into the &quot;room&quot; where Cyndreela and her pet are as well as several Dry Bone Skeletons.<br />
<br />
I am currently camped to the left of the entrance next to a big rock.  This was described to me as a &quot;safe&quot; spot by this Cleric.  I'm nearly level 50 and some of the Specs on the way in were blue to me.  Has anyone out there sucessfully camped Cyndreela and if so, can you give me some insight on do's and don'ts?<br />
<br />
Do I need to kill all the DB's before I attempt Cyndreela and how big of a threat is her pet?<br />
<br />
Will attacking Cyndreela aggro all the DB's? <br />
<br />
Any strategies or preventative measures you can give me from getting my arse killed or making the whole process easier would be greatly appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Reach me at my home e-mail and also forward any help to my work e-mail guryasz@dtn.com<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

Attacking her will not agro all the DB's around her.  Not unless you are in their agro range, no matter what level you are them DB's will attack you if your in their agro range even if they are green beyond belief.  The pet is a possible problem of course because he will disrupt your spells when your attempting to cast them.  You will have to root him and then deal with her.  If your lucky when she pops you can attack her even before she casts her pet to begin with.  Other than that, go for it.  Just don't fall into the fear gate  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
