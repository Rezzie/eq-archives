I managed to get my last bubble of 42 last night and make it into 43. Five bubbles to go and I get those new spells!.<br />
<br />
Lake Rathe Zone. The island in the middle of the lake that has all those nice Deep Water Goblins underneath.<br />
<br />
Now I was in a group of four last night and the XP was great. (42 cleric, 45 Druid, 48 Ranger, 48 Paladin)<br />
<br />
I know that you would be hard pressed to solo one of these under level 44. They may con blue, but they have mass HPs and hit pretty dang hard (multiple 70s.) It might be feasible with a team of two. A cleric and a tank, though the down time might be longer.<br />
<br />
The one thing that I would point out, is that it might not be too feasible to try it with a team of two... because sometimes you can't just pull one. We had three at one time and it was pretty damn hard for the four of us to controll the situation.<br />
<br />
Just another area to get the much desired XP!<br />

<br />
Just go get yourself 1 druid or 1 ranger. And you can go NUTZ doin the dome, me and a guildy did it for about 5 hours and we can keep up with the spawn pretty good. Just watch out for the marauder.<br />
He is a lvl 42-43 mob that will chew you up. You will need 3 people to take him down. <br />
You find him below the statue in the doorway.<br />
I just need to find out what lvl i can solo these guys.</div></div><hr />
