<br />
3 trips ago, we saw 2 of them and we only went as far as horsies.<br />
<br />
2 trips ago, we got 5 of them in clearing the whole plane.<br />
<br />
Last trip we got 4 of them and only went as far as bees.<br />
<br />
They were not even dropping from bosses, but from regular old mobs.<br />

What I've seen is tons and tons and tons of the class specific haste belts (you know the ones with decent ac and stats but pretty crappy haste).  Anyway, I'm sure milage will very but on our server we don't seem to have WotG's raining from the sky.  *I crack myself up*<br />
