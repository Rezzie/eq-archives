<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I just found this site in the past few months, so forgive me if this is a dead horse  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
One thing has boggled me ever since I started playing a cleric.  Why is it that clerics don't start out with any bonuses to resistances?  Monks get +fire, rangers get +fire and cold, rogues get +poison, warriors get +magic, and specifically, paladins get +disease.  Aren't paladins supposed to be warrior/cleric?  So where do they get the disease bonus?  Certainly not from the warrior side.  Logically, it comes from the cleric side.  Yet, true clerics don't get squat.  I'd like to see clerics get a resistance to disease at least, equal or better than a pally.<br />
<br />
Yes, we have the ability to buff those resistances.  I'm inclined to believe that we don't always have those resistances memed.  Personally, I can find a better spell to go into my slot.  Besides, I'm not talking about new or existing spells.<br />
Yes, we have the ability to cure poison and disease.  Once again, not talking about spells.  Personally, I'd rather use my mana on something else.<br />
Yes, other classes, like druids and shamans, don't have inate resistances.  If I were a druid or shammy with SoW, I probably wouldn't get into too many situations where the monster actually got within melee range.  Casters have pets to take the disease or poison attacks.  If the pet dies, they lose out on a component.  If we die, we lose out on exp.<br />
<br />
Here's a proposition.  What if clerics were to get a bonus similar to warriors in that it would go up every 2 levels or so, but to disease instead of magic resistance.  And it would cap at level 50.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my 2cp  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I don't keep them memed either, but I load and throw them as they are needed. It only takes a couple of seconds between fights. I usually have one spell slot reserved for stuff that I cycle all the time with different stuff. Primarily buffs and resists, but also other stuff.<br />

These almost insignifigant natural bonuses seem to be a perk of playing a meelee class, which is why we dont get them :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talura cwn'Zeylon</div><div class="date">08-10-2000, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blah, why don't you ask for good DD and DoT spells while you're at it, in addition to an intelligent pet that is warmly with all critters throughout the land?<br />
Asking for resist bonuses is umm, hate to say idiotic, but it's idiotic. The only class which gets a bonus is the warriors...those 8 points in whatever are hardly significant. As both a warrior and a rogue I think I can say this...the MR is very nice, especialy with it increasing every two levels; I only wish my rogue got the same benefit...I'd be putting the unholy smack down on spiders left and right, and Trakanon would be quaking in fear of that mostly-rogue party coming to visit.<br />
If you want to crusade for something new, ask for undead DoT's. At least they'd be somewhat useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-10-2000, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont think that Group Resist Fire/Cold/Poison/Disease is unreasonable. Leave Group Resist Magic to enchanters, that's fine, but there are no group versions of the other resists, and it's a royal pain to cast 6 of them each time. We eventually get group spells for Heroism and Symbol, why no for the resists, which all appear in our spell line before our first symbol. I wouldn't mind seeing the group resists for fire/cold also go to druids and shamen, and poison/disease also go to necromancers. It would be merely a convenience, but a nice one to have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shamans get a group Resist Disease spell, not sure if they get a resist poison one. I agree group resists would be nice, but other classes already have them.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
