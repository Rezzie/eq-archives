</FONT><HR>To make a long story short this weekends raid on Fear has broken my spirit and I don't know if I will ever recover.<P>The guild I belong to and some allies have done fear before and even hate after the changes.. but this weekend we got wiped out on break-in to Fear.  18 hours later 2 more breakins lead by guilds that came to help failed and there were now over 150+ corpses in the zone.  I spent the whole day pleading with GM's, other guilds and people.  At one point I almost got banned because I told a GM to just leave as they refused to help and started to make people furious.<P>In the end the lead GM showed up along with 4 groups of 58+ folks to help us retrieve our gear before it poofed.  <P>Caleal was with them and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  If it were not for your aid many of my friends including myslef would have lost our gear and left EQ.<P>I am posting this because I need some support, I am shell shocked so to speak.<BR>Please don't insult or flame me, if you can't offer any support or good advice then don't post. <P><BR>I know what went wrong I just don't know how to fix it and thats where I need some help.<P><BR>Problem #1:<P>People did not assist.  This is what started it all.  Part of the problem was that we have to invite others outside the guild to do these raids.  It amazes me that people can get to level 46 and not know how to assist.  Im no sure if its lag, stupidity, laziness or ignorance.  I just dont know what to do about this besides having someone keep an eye out for people not assisting and then booting them from the raid.<P>Problem #2<P>I saw the worst from people.  I saw the worst from myself.  People lost friends, most lost 3 or 4 gold bubs of XP and I and many others spent every last penny on regents and invis potions. Short of time I don't know what I can do as the GM of my guild to rally the troops.<P><BR>Problem # 3<P>If you never spent a whole day staring at the computer thinking you were going to loose all the gear you spent 2 yrs collecting, you are lucky.  I logged on last night and could do nothing but buff newbies.  I killed Regis for fun but when asked to go to Seb I just couldn't do it.  Ive been one blue bub from 53 forever. Now im 4 gold bubs from it.  The light at the end of the tunnel has just gone out.. I really don't know what to do to get my groove back....<P>thanks for the ear and any encouragement you can muster.<P><P>------------------<BR>Kenobe Wan<BR>Healer of the 52nd Circle<BR>Praxium Knight<BR>Cazic-Thule<P>"And one time, at cleric camp, I...."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I've seen fear cause more burnout, bad feelings, and guild breaks than any other zone in the game.<P>First off: DON'T PANIC.  The worst thing that happens is when people start freaking out about losing their stuff and start rushing in, trying to loot/gate or whatever, following second wave break teams in, whatever.  I'm a firm believer that sometimes the best thing to do is find out when the next break is, then just log out and come back then.  Admit you lost, and then take a break.<P>Second: People control.  I understand if you have to bring in outsiders to have enough people, but having a bad person is worse than having one less.  One man isn't going to win fights, but one can certainly lose them.  Address it to the person directly.  Make it crystal clear what is expected, and if they're putting your raid in jeopardy, say so and remove them.<P>Third: Communication.  This goes a LONG way to taking care of point one on breaks.  Make sure everyone knows what's going on.  It's one thing to have all your stuff in an infested plane while the raid leader is putting together a plan to recover.  It's another to have all your stuff in an infested plane and not know what the heck is going on -- that's when people panic and do stupid things.<P>As for burnout -- maybe take some time off.  The XP loss, while harsh, is by no means permanent.  Don't play if you don't feel like it, and just try to have fun until you get back in the swing.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>/hug Kenobe<P>Several things:<P>First off, this is a good time to remember that this game is not about lewt or levels.  If you have been playign for 2 years and attained level 52 you already know this, but sometimes we need a reminder.  This game is about having fun with friends.  Period.  <P>Second, I love your sig.  The cleric camp bit makes me laugh everytime I see it.<P>Third, of all the nightmare stories I have heard in EQ, Fear tends to top the list.  Yours sounds awful.  I am sorry that you folks went through that.<P>Fourth, the assist thing....., I dunno, if I could cast a spell and really make people smarter, I would do it all the time in RL.<P>Fifth, All is well that finally ends.  It sounds like the ending is ok.  Take a couple weeks off.  Make a monk or a rogue twink and play for a while.  Don't twink them.  Run around killing stuff and doing quests.  Wear ratty gear until somebody walks up to you and gives you a FS rapier.  Remember how cool it is to get a gift from a stranger who has no ulterior motive whatsoever, just wants to help out another human being.  Or Dwarf or whatever.<P>Good luck and have fun playing or don't play.  Taking time off is always a good idea when stuff like this happens.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>If you know me, and you know my story, you know I spent 6 DAYS with my corpse in Fear, unrecoverable. I only got my gear back by waiting for a patch and running in to Fear before they repopped the zone.<P>I went from 1/2 a yellow bub away from 52 to 1/2 a yellow bub INTO 49. Yes, almost a full 3 levels.<P>This happened just a couple days before I got hacked and ended up losing everything anyway and quiting for 8 months.<P>I came back. Took me a long time, but I came back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>I feel your pain... well about 0.02% of your pain, from a failed fear attempt last weekend.<P>About the assist thing... I think Verant patched it a couple of weeks ago, such that people can no longer assist... they found out that by attacking one target, and mezzing the rest, people could kill things!!!  Yeah Yeah... it's insane... Hate raid last night... lewt drops were amazing (about 40% of the mobs dropped things I think... I've only been on 4 raids so far... but that tops the rest BY FAR)... but people could not firken assist... enchanters started getting res discount cards I think.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Yeah My First Fear run was a Disaster.  The good news is that once you get up there its really alot of fun.  Its pretty easy to hold and if you get in a group with no one important then you just nuke/buff and loot there a usally not too many clerics on fear runs so you have a good chance of getting one of those nice cleric belts.  any way when in doubt, do what i do, Drink heavly.<P>Cland Carbuncle, Loyal Understudy to the great Friendlar<BR>Lvl 51 Vicar, Rallos Zek<BR>Court of the Crosswinds</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have to admit that really sucks.<P>But....<P>They don't call it "Fear" for nothing....<P><BR>Best CR method I've seen yet is this.<P>1. Cleric binds by rock near fear portal.<BR>2. Take death so you have 3 hours of res's on that corpse. Res yourself.<BR>3. Loot nothing but some coins and buff to the max. Not having anything that you don't mind losing on yourself really helps and your counting on that SOW/INVUL to keep you safe anyway. <BR>4. Mem both invuls.<BR>5. Use the longer casting invul then run thru portal and train all mobs away from the portal and WW area. The farther you train them away the more time you give your FD team. Remember to have that 2nd invul ready to use.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>6. FD person #1 zones in and FD's at portal. This person NEVER gets up until CR is complete.<BR>7. FD person #2 zones in and runs to WW camp and FD's. This person also NEVER gets up until CR is complete.<BR>8. FD person #3 (corpse dragger) zones in and FD's at portal. This is the corpse dragging person. All who died consent him prior to him zoneing in. This is the ONLY person who drags bodies from the portal to WW. The corpse dragging person (monk is best) uses the 2 FD'd people at Portal/WW as spies so he knows what's coming giving him time to FD early.<BR>9. The cleric who trained all the mobs away from the portal/WW area is res'd out before he dies (I normally just make a RES ME NOW! hotkey for this). Btw, you did have a cleric standing over your old body by the fear portal right?    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>10. The cleric is res'd back and lives. He is then rebuffed/healed etc. He goes back into fear and trains any/all mobs away from portal/WW anytime the "Corpse Dragger" tells him that he needs mobs moved.<BR>11. After all bodies have been moved from portal to WW you get a group of "non naked" people to zone in and run to WW. Haveing the naked cleric train all mobs away from WW usually helps them to get there. Sometimes at this point you might not have a full group of people left to do this. Basically you just want this group of people to consist of two tanks, two clerics, a enchanter, and a druid or wiz. The tanks are their to give the enchanter time to mez and the evac'r is there to ONLY evac. Haveing one of the clerics res while the other heals helps to. I've also seen it done with one tank and three clerics.<BR>12. Then you just try and res people as fast as you can. Having a cleric epic really helps here.<P>I've seen this strategy or variations of it work well many times. It's actually alot simpler than it looks. Also, having the 3 FD people in fear grouped really helps in communication. <P>You can do this with less FD people but this is the fastest way to do it.<P>Resurrector<BR>Cleric of the 57th (Veeshan)<P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Resurrector (edited 03-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hi there Kenobe,<P>on the bright side, u should know who would be ur reliable partners now<P>ur story reminds me my first "real raid" in Fear, was long long ago, the first week Fear got buffed into a 46plus only zone:<P>2 of the biggest guilds in my server decided to check Fear after a patch (when u can no longer run a lvl1 char into Fear). needless to say, we got wiped out almost instantly...<P>the socalled 36hrs CR is indeed not a CR, we just creating more corpses there. most of us died over 10 times lost a couple lvls. our event leader got his own gears back after 10 plus suicide runs but he insisted stay n help others... well.. it resulted him lose of 4 lvls -- from capped in 50 down to lvl46..<P>as more n more ppl corpses being proofed n deleting accounts, server GM show up, killed half the mob in zone...<P>yes we were panic n frustrated 2 but we grow up, learnt a lot from it n got many good friends<P>about the CR method, Resurrector listed it qute details. here s a lil amendment:<BR>- the best "Trainer" (to train mob off SS) s Pally (good hp n LoH) who knows the Fear zone well<BR>- when mob trained off SS, Trainer calls clr + one FDer (necro best) zonein, run to SS with ivis n bind there. if mob arggoed, clr plug off ur modem or otherwise camp/log. Necro keep FDing n inform when should others zone in, when should clr log back etc<BR>- if u (or ur guild) can afford it, everyone should carry a coffin for "chain summon corpse", to shorten n smooth out the break in<P><BR>sorry Kenobe about my grammer just want to share my lil experience before bed (very tired)  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ouch Kenobe  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>Give yourself a couple of days break and you'll probably be looking forward to playing again.<P>What method of break did you attempt and how many people were on the break?<P>There are several methods I've seen used, but the one that works best for me is this:<P>Never break Fear with more than four groups. The more people on the break, the more chance that someone will do something stupid. Have everyone else sit outside the portal and wait until the break team has done their job.<P>Try not to have more than one break newbie in each break group. again, experienced people are less likely to mess up and kill the break.<P>Have an evacer in each group and if things are looking impossible, have the raid leader call evac. Trying again after replacing 2-3 dead people is much better than having 24 attempting a naked break.<P>Make sure that everyone knows that if invis drops and they agro. They die in place and don't train the camp.<P>Zone in, turn 90 degrees left and run till you hit the wall. Do the break from there.<P>In 20+ breaks, Ive had to evac once and reform for a second attempt.<P>Two things kill breaks of Fear. People training the break camp and people not assisting. These are the reasons to keep the break numbers low.<P><BR>On the assist not working thing. Everyone probably has DMF on, make sure they all tilt their view down when they are running. This will have everyone at ground level when they reach the camp. If the main assist is floating 20 feet in the air, assist often wont work on him. Difference in height is the only thing i've seen that stops assist working. You see a similar thing if the tanks are on the floor and you are sitting on the wall in Hate. Moving low on the wall gets it working again.<P>Remember, it could be worse, you could be a druid  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>Don't give up and think of the feeling you will get when you next have a Fear break and it goes flawlessly.<P><BR>Kallain Ironsoul.<BR>Templar.

</FONT><HR>You can't bind in Fear after the patch?<P>About a month ago we had two members from my guild get left LD in Fear after a raid, and die when logging in the next day.  A few more people went up there and contributed their bodies.  We tried two raids inside that did nothing, and camped that night out from lack of help, expecting that someone would clear it the next day.  Well, that guild cancelled their raid, and we had a fully spawned Fear to go up against.<P>I grouped with 3 evacers and got everyone fully buffed.  Got two rabbits to zone in and train mobs away.  We zone in and run to the North wall.  I bind and they try to evac me back out so I can gate back in.  Too many mobs so I just /Qed and died up there.  Necro FDed at Nwall and told me when it was clear to log back in.  Log in, drag my body to the right spot and hang tight while the necro drug bodies to me.  We rez everyone in and evaced out.<P>CR in Fear is very easy to do as long as one cleric is willing to bind themselves there (If they still can today), and you don't mind eating a few deaths.  Would have loved to try the rez-back-out method, but I was the only cleric.<P>It scared me off of Fear for a long time, and I honestly would be horribly afraid of doing a fresh break if there wasn't a cleric already camped in there, but it was one of the most exciting times I ever had in EQ.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well not to be condescending , but Fear can be a very ugly zone, and as much as I like to help people out, I rarely go unless my guild is going, before you go, you have to look at who is going and judge if you are going to spend hours killing mobs, or hours in CR. If I don't feel comfortable about the number and quality of the people inviting me, I simply decline. Pickup Fear raids end up being CR runs about 60% of the time. Make sure you know who is leading the raid, and wht their experience is,, I always ask questions before I commit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The thing that we have been doing as of late that seems to have a lot of success is this.<P>Form 2 - ONLY 2 - groups.  Make them groups that can listen and follow instructions.  You need 3 tanks 1 cleric 1 enchanter 1 evaccer - preferably druids with evac to Sro - the ONLY job of the evaccer is to evac.  No healing period.<P>Get 2 FDer's - preferably monks.  Buff them up with every hp and stat buff to make FD easier.  Send both in at same time.  <P>1 will FD right at zone in.  2nd will run down towards the west wall before he/she FD's.<P>Once they are both successfully FD. You wait a couple mins for agro to calm down and then you buff and invis everybody in the 2 break groups.<P><BR>Once the portal area is cleared of roamers or very minimum numbers, both break groups zone in with invis on and move as quickly as possible to the west wall.  Once there, you stand there and wait.  Do not pull stuff.  Things there will wander around and eventually will agro on their own.<P>Once stuff starts to agro, mess as much as possible and try to kill 2 or 3 things.  Once you have killed a couple things, evac both groups out at the same time.<P>Run back to the portal and med up, rebuff and get ready to go back in.  Invis and then when the clear signal is given, zone in, run to West wall and wait invis again until stuff agros.<P>Keep doing this until you have the portal roamers cleared.  Then you can start zoning in the rest of the groups 1 group at a time invis, and make way to the west wall.  Fight some of the stuff there and then move to whereever you normally set up camp.<P>We have done this method several times and have always had success doing it.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Last weekend, our guild made it's first attempt at the 'revamped' Fear.  Things went wrong for a while, so since this is the spot for it, I though I'd share out problems and solutions.<P>We've always used the North Wall camp, so we thought we would break the same way this time.  As always we started by running in an SK into the zone and having her FD to keep up up to date on roamers around the portal.  She would tell us when the zone-in was relatively clear to time other groups going in.<P>The next group was the FD'ers.  Another SK, a necro, and 2 monks ran in with full Rune and HP buffs, and stationed themselves around the zone - 2 monks in the far NW corner, the necro at the safe camp a bit to the east, and the SK between the portal and the north wall.  We then made 2 'sacrifice' groups of high-HP characters, put a cleric in each, and ran them in invis.  The gameplan was that the 5 non-cleric group members would fan-out north of the portal aggroing as much as possible, and run them dead into the NW corner of the zone.  The cleric would then rush through the mob-free area to the north wall, camp, and all was well.  <P>Helpful notes about being the cleric in a sacrifice group:<P>1)  Make sure people know their role.  Sacrifice groups run *ahead* of the cleric, not behind them.  Don't let your warriors think they will taunt of hit mobs off the cleric.  They won't last the 30 seconds the cleric needs to camp, and the cleric will end up with a flood of mobs on them with 15 seconds left to camp.<P>2)  It's important that your tanks also know that they should stand still once they hit the NW corner.  You get a tank that thinks they'll give you 'extra time' by kiting mobs around, and then proceed to run the train on them close enough to the cleric to get them aggro'ed, so that they have a train of mobs squish them with under 5 seconds left to camp.  (sigh)<P>3)  Know how fast you zone.  If you are a fast zoner, give the rest of your party a 15 or 20 second head start so that you don't end up zoning in ahead of everyone and catching gate roamer aggro.<P>Due to the above 3 mistakes, we ended up being unable to camp a cleric for about 40 minutes after the start of the raid.  We did finally get it right, and I managed to mosey on and camp without spotting a single mob.<P>I still like the North Wall camp, it's very safe, you get to wave hello to Cazic, and the 'summon' point is only a few yards away.  There IS now a roamer that comes very close to the camp since the patch - A Glare Lord now roams close to the eastern side of the safe spot, but seems to be on a very long roam pattern.  He ganked me a few times after I had bound there during the CR, but then didn't come back for like an hour, so it's a very long-term thing.  <P>Anyway, I got camped, bound, and we started the CR thing.  We were blessed to have two very capable monks and a great rogue with us, so once we got started, CR was very quick and painless - having most of the bodies nearby in the NW corner helped a lot too.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>/agree Dalur,<P>I personally wouldn't use a method where people were guarunteed to die. Two dangers. One, if the cleric doesn't get camped, you're doing a naked run the second time. Two, you run the chance of getting wanderers in the camp while reses are in progress. Still, if it works for you...<P>Yes, it is possible to break Fear with two groups (without even having to evac), but I was guessing that they wouldn't have the levels to do it. That's why I said never more than four groups.<P>I also forgot to mention having FD scouts around the portal to tell the break teams when to enter.<P><BR>Kallain Ironsoul.<BR>Templar.

</FONT><HR>You can bind in Fear<P>"safespot" is a bit misleading - there are no safespots in Fear, just "safer".<P>Post Kunark most raids should be able to break Fear with 2 groups np - certainly 3, 4 is more than is best IMO.<P>If the worst comes to the worst -<P>Monks drag corpses to the SW safespot.  This is where really good monks are needed in Fear - not because you need them to pull when a raid is going well.<P><BR>Someone is FD at the SS so they can call all clear.<P>Run a group to the SW safespot.  2 Clerics, 2 enchanters, and 2 others - equipped high level tanks if possible, if not, good trainers.<P>Everybody camps out.<P>ONE Cleric, and one enchanter logs in, they have to be right back against the wall.  The Cleric reses people, one by one.  As people are resed they get invised by the enchanter while they loot, then they camp.  They must stay invis at all times. <P>They get resed, loot (all corpses, staying invis), camp.  Nothing else.<P>Nobody else gets resed until that person has camped.  So there are only ever 3 people in the SS, they are invis at all times, and they can all stay right back against the wall.<P>If a mob comes, the enchanter will mez it while the Cleric camps, then if possible camp themselves.<P>If the Cleric dies, the second Cleric/ench log in, res the first pair, and camp.  If brave enough they should be bound in Fear just in case.<P>It's slow and painstaking, but it prevents extra corpses in Fear, there is really very little chance of aggro this way, and if you get it - you have backup.<P>Eventually, you will have a raid equipped and at the SS.  People will have res effects and be oom BUT they are there.  They should be in chat.<P>You should have - 2 Clerics with mana (maybe only one if the reser doesn't have epic), 2 enchanters with mana, 2 Tanks with buffs and no res effects (if you had them on run in).<P>So now you get two, or max 3 groups of your best people to log in, get grouped, and get quick buffs and mana - Clerics and enchanters shouldn't buff to the point where they don't have much mana.  People should be invis where possible.  YOu need to get ready FAST.  Then as the roamers come by, you grab them one by one.  Every mob killed makes that SS safer, and soon, you have a broken Fear for people to log in to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I bound in Fear once again the other night for Cazic Thule as did everyone else.  I keep expecting VI to fix that and deprive us all of the opportunity to tease the hell out of the one caster who dies and shows up at their bind spot in a fully populated Fear.   =)<P>We use the West Wall break method on Tunare.  The massive raid failures are mostly a thing of the past now with higher level players.  There is some good advice here though...I definitely agree with the 'fewer is better' method, and wouldn't take more than 4 groups to break the zone.<P>Also if you have inexperienced players, the chances of someone going the wrong way or getting ported are pretty high.  Put an evaccer or two in each group (is Fear ever short on druids and wizards?), and call EVAC if you get too many mobs.  It's very easy to recover quickly, get back to Feerott, and zone back in.  The beauty of it is, you've usually taken down a few mobs and even if you have to evac again, each time you whittle down the number of break mobs.  That way you don't have complete wipeouts.  <P>I'd not do a Fear break without at least two clerics and two enchanters.  <P>Alendora Ehren<BR>Talisman, Tunare <A HREF="http://www.norrath.org" TARGET=_blank>www.norrath.org</A> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Did CoH to North wall and after couple of hours got things going.

</FONT><HR>Interesting techniques on breaking Fear.<P>Surprises me that no one has mentioned the idea that I recommended to my guild to try once.  It has since been used on many raids with less than 2 deaths on break in multiple times.<P>Send in 2 feign death folks.  One feigns at portal, the 2nd near North Wall.  When it's clear to run to North Wall have a Mage and Druid run to North wall Camp.  These 2 need to know the route well!  Once these 2 get there, Druid gates back to Feerott.  Have Druid invite in persons 1 at a time into the group with the Mage, SOW and INVIS person and have them zone in.<P>Mage casts Call of Hero on the person who zones in and effectively whipes aggro if person was aggroed at zone in.  The person zoning in has to only remember to keep running if aggroed.  Takes 10 seconds for COH to cast so once it's cast on person they can camp out to chat.  Rinse and repeat till the entire raid party is at North wall.<P>We have effectively moved entire raid party to North wall in about 20 Minutes with 2 deaths or less on multiple occasions.  I would recommend that Clerics, Enchanters and Necros are some of the first to join the raid group.  Necros to feed Mage with mana.<P>Good luck...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The res box will stay up for a considerable amount of time now, however it will auto-cancel once you start to loot a corpse.<P>Basically what you should do is do a break-in with spare gear.  Just mez everything that comes to camp, and try to kill it off one by one.  Have people loot all but 1 item on their corpses, and be ready to evac.  Exp can be obtained rather quickly, your gear will take significantly longer.  You might have to evac and break in again, but every mob you kill means less for the next try.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005869&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005869&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
