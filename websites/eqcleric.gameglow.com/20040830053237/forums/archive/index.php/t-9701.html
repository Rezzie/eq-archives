<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramulet</div><div class="date">10-27-1999, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ack! An extra 7.8 to carry around.<br />
<br />
Weight (includes 2 bracers)<br />
Rubicite = 24.9<br />
Cleric = 32.7<br />
<br />
Total AC (includes 2 bracers)<br />
Rubicite = 80<br />
Cleric = 71<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
In case you want to check my math,<br />
<br />
Boots of the Reliant = AC 9, +6 vs Disease (wt 4.9) <br />
Rubicite Boots = AC 10 (wt 3.6)<br />
<br />
Ardent Gauntlets = AC 10, +5 Agi, +5 vs Cold (wt 3.8)<br />
Rubicite Gauntlets = AC 11 (wt 2.8) <br />
<br />
Chestplate of the Constant = AC 18, +8 Sta, +5 vs Magic (wt 7.5) <br />
Rubicite Breastplate = AC 19, Rubicite Aura (wt 6.0) <br />
<br />
Greaves of the Penitant = AC 11, +5 Int, +5 vs Poison (wt 5.6) <br />
Rubicite Greaves = AC 12 (wt 4.2) <br />
<br />
Vambraces of the Fervent = AC 9, +5 Dex, +5 vs Fire (wt 4.9) <br />
Rubicite Vambraces = AC 10 (wt 3.7) <br />
<br />
Bracers of the Reverant = AC 7, +5 Wis (wt 3.0)<br />
Rubicite Bracers = AC 9 (wt 2.3)<br />
<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
And yes I know most people aren't running around wearing full rubicite because they are opting for +wis items, but I think this is still a reasonable comparison since that the armor was added to replace rubicite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shrank all the crafted on my gnome last night, dropped 11.8 lbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Keryath, where did you shrink your crafted?  Can a dwarf shrink there also?  I have a dwarven warrior buddy who really wants to get his crafted shrunk, but isn't quite sure how to go about it.  Does he need to bring money, etc....<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paladin</div><div class="date">10-30-1999, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another sign that the quest armour was not thought out very well.... the paladin platemail quest armour is not only lighter than the clerics, its also lighter than the ranger/shaman/rogue chainmail quest armour.<br />
<br />
My STR is 145, why do I need light armour?  Give the light armour to the cleric!  This is pure insanity on the part of Verant!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its possible the person in charge of Clerics either hates everyone he works with so he doesn't talk to them, or they hate him.<br />
<br />
Maybe he hates EQ but its the only job he can get?<br />
