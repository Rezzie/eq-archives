At these levels (and for many levels after), there is just no better loot than lightstones. Turn them in to the gypsy at the camp in N Ro for some nice experience and (for Greater Lightstones) a research tome worth over 7pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frobozz</div><div class="date">09-28-2000, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wisps require magical weapons to hit.  Fortunately, clerics get to summon a magical hammer at lev 9.  It's not a bad weapon for that level either...<br />
<br />
Erud's crossing is popular for Erudites since greater lightstones provide them with some way to see in the dark.  Once they acquire one or two for their vision needs, the rest can be delivered to that gypsy in North Karana for the Concordance of Research book, which can then be sold for over 8 platinum.  So if you're wondering how to afford that nice set of banded, here you go...<br />
<br />
Be advised, wisps are social...so they will attack if one of their friends is hit.  Be careful with those pulls!</div></div><hr />
