<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grummp</div><div class="date">01-28-2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, didn't see this one listed, but if you have a group and a little time this is a place to check out. Overthere, I play on a pretty popular server, and HHP, HHK and Oasis are too crowded during peak play hours to make it fun.  Try Overthere, yes everyone will tell you, wait until 25, or 30, but your missing out on some nice exp and a not bad money.  Mudhole is what it is called on my server by some, http://www.deadzed.com/eq/images/The_Overthere.gif <br />
<br />
Called Semi Dry lake on this map, The only problem with this spot is Bring Your own group, as you will not be able to find a group at this level in zone. Ocasionally you will find a group hunting there, but on my server the area is usually empty. There is a merchat that you can sell/buy supplies from at the lake, the mosters drop some pretty nice loot for the level, and Rhino's drop Ivory and other items that can sell for 4-5pp each.<br />
<br />
How do you get there? From Oasis take the boat to the Tum Deep. The jump off and follow the mountains on right as you get off boat, go across island to the dock where you will ride the ship to the Overthere fort. Watch out for the Ogre by the dock, but if you stay away he doesnt agro. There is also a Ogre Camp, with the Great Ooommpp. Stay away for him, he's nasty at this level. So sit and wait for the boat. If your lucky 5min, if not I think it can take up to 15min to arrive. You will zone into the OT, then when you get to the Fort you will have to jump off the boat and swim to the wall. OT Fort good races will be KOS, but you can bind in the corner of the wall by fort. If a high level is on boat with you ask them to show you. Alot of high level people take this boat to OT, someone showed me the first time I went there. I usually bind at the wall then if I have to gate, I will have enough time to camp out agro if needed. Once you have bound swim out around the wall. Wow, got my swimming up to like 40 now after a few trips there. Once you get out, run along the coast, keeping water on your left as you go down until you get to the hills/mountains in front of you. Then you take right and go to the Semi-Dry lake. The only thing that will agro you here is the Sarnak's. Watch out for them they are social and will help each other out. Once you get to the lake, that is where you pull to, no guards, but Wars Woods zone is pretty close. Might go to zone first before you start pulling. <br />
<br />
Once you start hunting like I said Sarnaks are the only thing that will agro, everything else wont agro you for most part. My group had a Shaman so we kept SOW up all the time incase of a bad pull or big add. The only time we had problems was when we had like 4 adds and our Tank was at the OT Fort changing money for us. He was a SK so he would talk our money when we got encumbered to fort and convert to plat. for us. Rhino's hit pretty hard as well as some of the Sarnaks but money was good, and xp couldnt be beat. <br />
<br />
I have been able to go here with a Guild member, and we pick up some people from Oasis to come with us, then make the journey. Always had a good time. Well, hope this helps someone out.  I for one hate HHP/HHK and Oasis when it is busy. Everyone fighting over spawns. This is sure to never happen in OT. The one time that I have been there with another group we still never ran out of thinks to kill. And this area could easily support 3 or 4 groups with no problem.</div></div><hr />

I didn't have much luck trying to solo there, though, so went back to other places.</div></div><hr />

<br />
East of the outpost over to the mudhole mobs are a bit higher level, and south mobs a much higher level<br />
<br />
I usually med up just at the edge of the gorge, did do 6 blue in about 45-60 minutes at that place, downtime can be bad since i take a beating sometimes.<br />
<br />
But i have to agree with the original poster xp is very nice and when you get an ivory,pearl,amber and a jade drop in a few hours you feel rather good(ivory sold for 6pp)<br />

<br />
This has been my secret spot to solo my toons from 19-24.  After they put the merchant right at the mudhole that sells bandages it was even better.  Sure you get creamed by buying/selling there but its better than running to a town.<br />
<br />
I've taken a monk, cleric, warrior, and half of a druid from 19-24 in that place.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that if more than one other person is soloing there (or a lower level group) then it was hard to find mobs to kill.  However, at the time I was doing this hardly anyone ever showed up here.<br />
<br />
The cash is nice, not only do they drop plats but you can get rhino horns that sell for 7-8pp and succulent sap and other stuff that sell for plats.  I always had enough cash to buy back bandages and have some left over.<br />
<br />
And yes, I solo'd very easily as a cleric (over a bub/hour).  My secret was this wonderful spell called Yaulp II.  Yep, it does have a use!  And, of course, my trusty old Bullsmasher!<br />

I hunt at the warsliks wood  side of the zone till 24 then goto the Skyfire side. IF YOU ARE NOT A DARK ELF OR HAVE GOOD FACTION READ THIS......<br />
There is patrols of Dark Elf guards. They are bright red to 54 and can take out a mage earth pet warrior rogue and paladin out in less then 2 minutes. Only other time I have a complete group wipe out was The Dark blood dire wolf in MM the shaman epic wolf. Its blue to me at 45 and quad hits for 230 and is highly resistant to root</div></div><hr />
