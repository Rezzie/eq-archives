Hi I'm Tekara a Erudin Heretic.  I'm currently lvl 8.  Tox is a good zone for newbies to about lvl 8 or so.  Actually they have some mobs that can take you higher but you need to be quite a few lvls higher to take them on.  Now that Paineel has open there are a lot more Erudins to group up with and more types of mobs in this area.  I camp an Abandoned Heretic pet which spawns right next to the zone to Paineel.  Right now he cons Yellow and Black/White (Even) to me at lvl 8.  If he cons Yellow I can still solo him, but I have to have FM.  I'm going to go to Kerra Isle next to raise my faction for Erudin to dubious, so I can get to the docks and head to Antonica.<br />
