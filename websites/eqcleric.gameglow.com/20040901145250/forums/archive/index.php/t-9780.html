<br />
Frankly, I wouldnt mind the way cleric quests are a set up right now if the stats were *dramatically* enhanced.<br />
All pieces should get +1ac, bp ,arms, bracers should get +2.<br />
Keep +wis on the bracers, because this creates another option to let steam off RMB prices.<br />
Put like 4-5wis on boots, GE Boots are too rare. Put 5 STR and 5 INT on legs. (STR is one of our main stats) <br />
<br />
Wow that would be so nice if that happened. If the Cleric BP was 20ac, 8sta 2wis 15mana 15hp it would be really nice, but still an option when compared to BS, EB or even Mith.<br />
<br />
Regardless of any changes, the AC of the cleric armor should be raised soon. If they make the quests eaiser, so be it. I wish they just fixed the stats.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mlar D'Kath</div><div class="date">02-09-2000, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vehemently disagree,for the armour to be balanced without changing the quests then all pieces would have to:-<br />
<br />
a) Weigh 50% less<br />
b) have at least 5ac more per piece<br />
c) have at least 5 wis more per piece.<br />
<br />
Why so much? because i can get a paw of oppolla( +9Wis +9AC +9agi +5sta +5mana -5 sv Disease -5 cha) in less time than it takes to get some of these.<br />
<br />
A proper fix would be<br />
<br />
a) Weight similar to rubi<br />
b) 1-2 more ac per piece<br />
c) Wis on bracers moved to another piece<br />
d) another 10 wis or so spread over 2-3 pieces<br />
e) Half the quest items made rare drops from common mobs<br />
f) 2nd Half on NPCs with at most 1 hour respawn no PHs.<br />
g) NPCs ONLY have Cleric quest items on them<br />
h) Remove &quot;enchanted&quot; requirement<br />
i) Make sure EQUALLY difficult for Good/Evil clerics.<br />
j) if i) not possible then have seperate quests for evil clerics<br />
k) Replace shield with a helmet<br />

<br />
You want to treat these as camps?  THen don't complain that they take forever.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea for you:  Whenever you're traveling through Kith, check on the boots.  If they're not there, shrug, think to yourself &quot;oh well and move on.  Same for everything else.<br />
<br />
I have the boots and vambraces, as well as the Icon of the Constant.  I have not camped a single mob.  The items/mobs were simply there when I was passing through.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 problems with the armor itself:<br />
<br />
1) 1 or 2 more AC per piece would be nic.<br />
2) A slightly reduced weight would be nice.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the armor is fine.  And don't throw the whole, &quot;Paladins get 14 wis, we only get 10! Waaah!&quot; line out.  You know how much mana paladins get per wis at level 50?  3.  3 mana per 1 wis.  Give it a rest.<br />
<br />
On Test the spawn levels have been increased.  I've observed this myself.  If the spawn times have been decreased OR there are no more placeholders, then the quests are fine.<br />
<br />
Oh, on the enchanted platinum bars...  We aren't the only class that needs them.  I know paladins do.  Without getting into the issue of enchanters having a stranglehold on that service (and besides, I have a 29 enc in my pocket  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif) should we demand to not have to use plat while they still have to?<br />

Reread what i said.Nowhere did i mention removing plat bars.I only said to remove the requirement for them to be enchanted.<br />
<br />
As to passing through a zone,how often do you just cruise/hunt in<br />
<br />
a) Kerra<br />
b) Befallen<br />
c) Aviak isle in OOT<br />

<br />
That still leaves the paladins with requiring enchanted plat.  If anything, they should be the ones not requiring it, considering the difficulty of their quests (camping rare mobs + working faction up in every paladin city + killing at least 1 SG for every piece + 2 enchanted bars of plat for every piece).<br />
<br />
 a) Kerra<br />
b) Befallen<br />
c) Aviak isle in OOT<br />
<br />
Hrmm, I spent quite alot of time in Befallen when I was younger.  Now that I know how nice aviak isle is, I plan on moving there with Khory once she makes 10th level or so.  Admittedly, there isn't much on Kerra except for Erudites in their young levels.<br />
<br />
But you're missing my point.  If you want to go to Kerra and sit on your arse for 8 hours, fine.  You do that.  But don't complain about the camp.  How about getting a druid to port you over to Tox, and then checking once?  If Maugarim isn't up, then log.  Are you understanding me now?  THESE DON'T HAVE TO BE CAMPS.<br />
<br />
 These are VALID concerns and if you have nothing constructive to add keep your<br />
mouth shut.<br />
<br />
These are VALID points and if you don't intend to see the other side of the issue don't post on a public messageboard.<br />

<br />
The cleric quests arent that bad if you *happen* on them. For instance, I never camped the things in Kithicor. But everytime I passed through Kith I checked. I made 3 pairs this way, never ever camping them. Granted, Bilge and Sludge and such arent as easy, but can still be accomplished by making sure you're in the general area. My twink was fighting at the Aviak isle, getting great xp. Gull popped. My cleric was camped near the spectre island. Brought him over, got my arms.<br />
<br />
I *DO NOT* want to see what has happened to Warriors. Every single warrior has like full crafted. I think that really sucks out some of the value of being golden. I am one of maybe 10 clerics on my server wearing full golden. It took me lots of time to make and even trade for, but damnit it looks great and now I have some presence. Warrior walks into Sol B in full crafted? Who cares. Cleric with full golden gets noticed. <br />
<br />
In summary, while some camps (Babbinsbort and Gull especially without a doubt) need to be fixed, the overall difficult of the cleric quests can remain high, since there are great alternatives. But it would be really nice if the rewards equalled the effort. We shall see I suppose.<br />

Those two pieces are worthless, considering some alternatives.  The legs could be revisited, as well.<br />
<br />
Those that are complaining about the armor are too high to really get it.  The armor, imho, is designed for clerics levels 25-40.  After 40, better pieces can be acquired.  Certainly this armor is not meant to take the place of ethereal mist, but I think it's good armor.  I like the gloves, and the boots, and the arms, and the legs are decent.  But that still doesn't mean that I won't replace my legs with gatorscale leggings, and I won't replace the boots with GE boots, but for now, I'm perfectly content with the stats.  It's all at least 1 AC better than plate, which isn't too shabby, imho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarLocke</div><div class="date">02-09-2000, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly.  If you're only interested in wisdom, then of course you won't feel that the armor is worth getting.<br />
<br />
I, on the other hand, plan on getting a full suit eventually.  I lose 4 wis from my BS Tunic, and 4 Wis from gatorscale legs, but I will look good and have a decent AC.<br />
<br />
It's a status symbol, really.  I like proclaiming that I am a cleric.  I like the gold color.  I want to be called Nugget someday.<br />
<br />
It is each cleric's choice whether or not to get the armor.  If you don't want it, fine--but don't come here and tell others not to try for it.  It's THEIR choice.  That's what really irks me.<br />
<br />
Oh, I have one more peeve.  The people that want every piece to have +wis...  Huh?  Please, can we say &quot;one track mind?&quot;  There is more to your character than his/her mana pool.  If you want to be the mobile mana battery, fine, but don't try and force others into it.<br />

<br />
I couldnt care less if a single +WIS was added. But the AC on the pieces should be increased, atleast to the Bard level. I wear my suit because I thought the extra ac was worth the 50 some odd mana I lost w/ the Armband + Legs. If the plate's ac was rised to Bard level, my ac would be in the 700s. Like it should be at 40 if I am wearing full magical plate.<br />
<br />
I am a human cleric. My base wisdom is a modest 100. The fact is that if I were a high elf, I could have my pie and eat it too. I could wear full cleric plate and still have 170+ wis. But alas I am human. I have no complaints, but atleast this armor that is so hard to get could have some more rewarding stats. Not +WIS on all pieces, but maybe +STR and one other piece w/ +WIS?<br />

<br />
Seriously, though.  I also have a 100 base Wis.  At level 28 I have a modified 138 Wis.  It works just fine for me, and I know of several items I could get to add more (just haven't gotten around to it  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif).<br />
<br />
Eventually we'll all be in Ethereal Mist armor, and have ~200 Wis and ~800 AC anyway, but sacrificing AC for Wis on the way to that day is a mistake (IMO).<br />
<br />
Then there's the whole coolness issue of the armor  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/biggrin.gif.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't complain if we get more Wis...  Just that it's not all that necessary.  I agree on the AC though...  We need a point or two more on each piece.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yurian Stonebow</div><div class="date">02-10-2000, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Analysis shows that some pieces of the cleric armor will take nearly 40 hours to acquire. This is obviously unacceptable, and we are *greatly reducing* the time it should take. Spawn times, spawn percentages, and drop percentages are being adjusted across the board. This is not just for cleric armor, but for several, which I'll announce on patch-day. <br />
<br />
Please keep in mind though that initial availability might appear to be less than it actually is due to the rush that occurs when new items are brought in game. As I recall, when class-specific stuff was first put in, *every* class complained about availability. After a few weeks, only a few were left with a problem, as the hoards of initial people finished getting theirs. Since cleric armor is so rare at the moment, I imagine there will be a similar rush on all the servers as it becomes available.<br />
<br />
In response to some other posters, there are currently no plans to adjust any of the statistics (AC, Weight, Bonuses) on the armor. I do agree that AC and Weight needs to be discussed internally, just let us get the spawn times and such worked out before we move on to the next phase. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">02-10-2000, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just felt I needed to add my 2 cp to the paladin versus cleric thread above (regarding the requirement for both to have enchanted platinum).  Yes, paladins have it tough -- in terms of getting their faction up (but see below).  But otherwise, their quests are in areas that GIVE EXPERIENCE WHILE WAITING.  That is truly the key difference between paladins and clerics.  Clerics get to sit in befallen dungeon when they are 30 plus (to have any chance of taking babbins when he spawns) for 7 hours waiting for a PH.  Maybe they'll change this, and it will be lesser -- great! But even if it's every 20 minutes, and 1 in 3 spawns babbins instead of a PH (my experience was 1 in 7 or 8), that's still an hour waiting for one spawn -- in the meantime, you are getting NO experience.  On the other hand, helped a paladin friend get the cauldrons and mm granite from Mistmoore -- we  were getting tons of experience, great loot,  and actually having FUN! (gasp)  And nightfall giants, regular giants for sands of ro, undead cyclops, deepwater goblins... all give experience to 40 at least.  Considering the armor is really meant for those above 30 (someone above said 20's... give me a break! Show me the 25th level group willing to camp babbins or gull), the paladin quests are much more fun and exciting to complete.<br />
<br />
NOW:  Factions for paladins.  Little known fact (or so it seems)...  Once you have the 6 components for ronium (of which only Soil of Underfoot and Mistmoore Granite are no drop), you can make the ronium with the container given to you in temple of solusek ro.  The ronium is tradable.  Molds aren't - so if you're a dwarven paladin and want the bracers, find an erudian paladin to get the mold and make it for you (giving him the ronium).  Or if you don't trust him, both of you make ronium, then each make the other a piece of the armor (odds are, he doesn't have high faction with the dwarves).  Factions are a challenge if you make them into one -- otherwise, they don't even matter  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
As far as ronium goes -- I've made one bar so far for a paladin friend, and plan on making more.  Great experience in the process of acquiring the ingredients (except for the fairy dust and melatite which I get from others)  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">02-10-2000, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thoughts on the armor:<br />
<br />
The AC needs to be higher (aren't we a PLATE class).<br />
<br />
The stats need to be more in tune with our primary attributes (WIS, STR, AGI) and less with basically unimportant ones (INT).<br />
<br />
The spawns need to be moved to mob's that drop NOTHING else, then have their spawn times UPPED in a major way.<br />
<br />
The weight needs to go down.<br />
<br />
Ditch the shield (its kinda redundant with the charred guardian shield MUCH easier to acquire) and replace with a helm.  Let those who have keep the shield.<br />
<br />
DON'T touch the Caduceus, you actually got that one right (a proc or bonus would be nice, but its fine as is).<br />
<br />
This is about all I think, to make it worth the few hours a week I get to play the game. I realize this would make the armor commonplace. But hhhmmmmmm, lets see, HOW may suits of Ivy Etched and Crafted so you see running through Norrath?  Isn't the POINT of the armor to ATTAIN it, not WISH for it/BITCH about it?  Just a few of my thoughts on the issue.  <br />
<br />
Don't make the game for powergamers, you just screw over the rest of us.<br />

<br />
Fixing the spawns should indeed go a long way to correcting some of the quest problems.<br />
<br />
I would like to add that there are just not enough PLATE based wisdom/mana items for clerics. There are quite a few plate items that clerics cant use, I have yet to understand why a plate wearing class cant wear all plate type armors.<br />
<br />
Here are a couple of examples of plate type armor that is not wearable by clerics..<br />
Dark mail gauntlets<br />
Runed mithral torque<br />
<br />
The &quot;battle cleric&quot; post really had to be a joke. I'm gonna admit it right now, clerics can solo, and we can solo pretty darn well. We do not solo by running up and beating the hell out of a mob with our mace, we solo just like a wizard does.. root and nuke. We simply do not have the HPs and melee output to do much damage to a mob that we would get xp for. <br />
<br />
I love the idea of my cleric wading into a crowd of baddies swinging his mace and smacking down the bad guys.. but that IS fantasy in EQ. You can ask clerics to role play this all you want, but asking a cleric to run in and melee mobs is like asking a paladin or shadowknight to med during melee. We work to maximize the effectiveness of the group, clerics and casters med, tanks melee. Thats just the way its gonna work.<br />
<br />
If you really want to see &quot;battle clerics&quot; give clerics a decent proc'n weapon that we can actually obtain. I have always felt the cadaucuss should have proc'd something, either a direct damage spell (smite) or a AoE healing spell (regen or word of healing). Higher caps on some melee skills would also help. Its hard to melee a level 35 mob with skills that cap at level 26. Also, add a few points of wisdom on some of the quest armor items. <br />
<br />
I'm not gonna complain about the 10 wis points the armor has but I must complain about where the wisdom is. If there is one area clerics have many options for wisdom is the bracers. If that 10 wisdom had been placed on other items, I dont know if you would have ever heard a peep about wisdom. <br />
<br />
Here is where I would have put the 10 wisdom...<br />
Breastplate +3 <br />
Legs +2<br />
Arms +3<br />
gloves +2<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarLocke</div><div class="date">02-10-2000, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to Goryn:<br />
<br />
Yes, the AC needs to be increased.  2 points per piece is the consensus, I believe.<br />
<br />
The stat bonuses are fine as is.  Wearing a full suit of Ro armor, we lose? What? 27 Wis max (BS Tunic/Gatorscale Legs/CGS/Paw Gloves/GE Boots)?  That's not such a big deal.  Granted, the only item on that list that I have is the tunic, but I do fine with 138 Wis.  More Wis on the armor would be nice, but it's not necessary.  And please, don't ask for Wis at the expense of other useful stats.<br />
<br />
Spawns on Test have been rearranged.  For example, Bilge no longer drops the Icon of the Constant (or Ingot, whichever).  Instead, a new gob, Dwigus Lowater, drops it (also in DC).<br />
<br />
I'm kinda iffy on the weight issue.  It's already lighter than bronze.  It may not be as light as some sets of class armor, but it's also not the heaviest (un-resized crafted and darkforge are the 2 heaviest sets).  Not everyone can have the lightest armor.<br />
<br />
Umm, I like the shield.  Maybe I'm biased because halfling helms look like metal funnels.<br />
<br />
Agreed, Cadaceus is fine as is.<br />
<br />
Nazer:<br />
<br />
The wis/plate issue has been beaten to death before...<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, we have the choice of wearing plate, which druids and shamen do not.<br />
<br />
If you want uber-wis, you'll look like a druid.  Or you can wear plate and give up some wis.<br />
<br />
Make your choice and stand by it.<br />
<br />
Not gonna touch the battle cleric thing;  Gordon was on something when he posted that...<br />

I highly doubt there will be any stat changes to the armor. By up'n the spawns, as they apparently have on the test server, it sounds as tho this armor will no longer be hard to get and will now take its place as cleric armor for levels 30-40.<br />

If you want uber-wis, you'll look like a druid. Or you can wear plate and give up some wis.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Starting with a base of 118 wisdom, I have 200 now and still wear plate. *shrugs* I've never worn a BS tunic or gatorscale legs. Before I gor Dawnfire I was running around with 199 wisdom in plate so.. it IS possible. Just need to get the right combination of items that work for you.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
