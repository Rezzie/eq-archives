It is a hard place to lvl unless u know what u doin. It has alot of trains but it has great exp and get loot when u kill ghouls and things in th house in unrest.<br />
I'm a lvl 15 clr and i lvled 13-15 in about have a day but i know what i'm doin because i wacht my bro play and his a lvl 35war and he gets great loots from the unrst house. So if u new to the area u should try to find a group or u can solo near the zone thats my best avice )<br />

WOW.  the trains are really a sight to see.  I was really spooked seeing about 25 people outside the zone and heal spells going for about 15 minutes straight.  It takes a little getting used to, but you start to get a feeling for the place.  I know where the trains don't touch me now, and I know to cast Invis vs Undead when I med.  Invis vs Undead is my best friend now and I use it all the time.<br />
<br />
I bound myself right outside the zone so if I die, it's no big deal.  My group got trained on, and I got just about the full assult.  I cast divine auora, but could not run.  2 Gouls, dark bone, brabed bone and about 10 death beetles were all over me.  The Divine Auora allowed me to take the hits while my group ran away.  I was rooted by the ghouls and died, but wasn't a problem being bound so close.  It's better that I die than have to wait for a tank to come all the way from G. Fay.<br />
<br />
I didn't know Tormented Dead dropped Bronze!  Nice.<br />
