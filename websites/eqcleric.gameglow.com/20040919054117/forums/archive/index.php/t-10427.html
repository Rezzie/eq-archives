Usually (at least on my server) You could double up one of the small camps in NRo and around 12 if the large camp is taken you can either head to the Oasis for crocs, or assemble a group and head down to SRo. Be wary in SRo though, you should know your way around and be very wary of wanderin mobs, I've found it best to have your tanks sit in the middle of the camp (once its cleared of course) and everyone else BEHIND (by the wall) the camp, you wont aggro near as much back there and should still not have to worry about the dervs hacking you to pieces if your tanks are close enough. <br />
