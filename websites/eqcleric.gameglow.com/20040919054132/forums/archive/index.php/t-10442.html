NO TRAINS go through this area,well only the ones that you make ), so go there,sit against the wall, kill bugs,tormented dead,and greater skellies and watch the exp soar<br />

I am a bubble away from 17 and wanted to try out my new Screaming Mace, so I wandered over to the gazebo, tried my hand at a ghoul, and got smacked by a couple of beetles, the ghoul, and a tormented dead.  Needless to say, I was pounding the &quot;Train!!&quot; button as my little dwarven butt turned tail and ran as quickly as my stumpy legs would go.  I was on at lunch so I wasn't able to get more than a few minutes in.  I will let you know how it goes in a couple of days.  Now I am wishing I put more time into divination and Invisibility to Undead..... <br />

By the time you reach about 16th level you should do fine outside of the house.  That is if you be careful as to where the beetles are when you pull a mob.  This is a great place for us, and should be used as a training ground for us.  Use Sense Dead till it maxes out.  Once you have Divination maxed, cast invis undead and have a QUICK stroll through the house. If you can get a SOW, then do it, your life will depend on it.  <br />
<br />
One last bit about unrest, if you create a train or even see one, /shout it to the rest of the zone, it will save lives, others now and yours later.<br />

I would be standing by the fountain, see a train, cast Invisibility to Undead, and hit my hot-key.  I was perfectly safe.  After a half-dozen time someone else in the zone shouted &quot;Don't you do anything but train?&quot;  Another member of my group came to my defense and pointed out that they weren't MY trains.<br />
