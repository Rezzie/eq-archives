<br />
I thought making a post here might be suitable since we are recruiting quite a few new clerics and not all out there are aware, that you can still move to VS full equibbed with all your chars on one account for the normal 50 $ fee.<br />
<br />
So if you feel you belong in a highend guild, with normal european raid hours from 17.00CET(11 am EST) to 24.00 CET(6 pm EST). Then Mortalis might be a guild for you<br />
<br />
Its become apparant with fighting Plane of time gods that being just under 10 clerics is just not always enough, so be prepared to be apart of a larger cleric team hopefully working just as effecient as our last team have managed to do so over the past years.<br />

Sony and especially the useless morons at Ubisoft totally screwed up, I lost access to the account for 2 weeks and then suddenly everything was back and each side blamed the other. <br />
<br />
For as long as Ubi controls the euro server I will not even bother.<br />
