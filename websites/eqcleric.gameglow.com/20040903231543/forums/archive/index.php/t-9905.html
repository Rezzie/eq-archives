<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">11-13-2000, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, maybe just one in particular....one &quot;I-get-too-many-tells-for-SoW-and-ports-so-I'm-anon&quot; wood elf druid.<br />
<br />
I had just gotten level 48 that day (finally), and I was at the isle of the dead in OOT trying to get some experience before I logged for the night.  For a good 3 hours I was killing all the spectres on the isle, without interruption or any problems (through several camp checks I might add) .....when lo and behold, this anon druid comes up to me and hails me.  Managed to con him briefly...blue.  I ask him how I could help him.  He doesn't respond for a little bit, so I continue pulling.<br />
<br />
Now, I was engaged in the middle of a fight when he asked if I needed all 4 spectres.  Standard root/shoot technique.  I wasn't pulling to the edge of the island, maybe about mid-way along a flat stretch of rock.  For 3 hours of pulling to this spot, I was fine.  Anyway, as I root a spec and back off to fire and to send him a message, the druid gets too close to it, and sets the rest of them aggro.  Next thing you know, I'm getting pounded by all four spectres (root broke).<br />
<br />
To sum it up, I end up gating with half a bubble of health left, catch the boat, and when I get back, the druid is there quad-kiting the spectres.  Needless to say, I was irked enough to just log and walk away.<br />
<br />
Ah...just another day in Sol Ro  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

What had irked me to the point of logging off was that no apology or response was given.  He had just proceeded to take over the camp, which in my mind is rude.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, he's on my ignore list and the matter is forgotten.  Time to set my sights on 49...<br />

While I personally dont care for most druid$, I try and give each new one I meet a chance.  Not all of them are little turds whose only existance is to steal your exp, phat lewt, or whatever.  BUT, when I do meet a dr00d, they are sure to get the proper respect from me (none, plus an addition to my RL ignore list).  Just try and remember that anyone, even the nicest person, can have a bad day.<br />
<br />
[As a further disclaimer, addition to my ignore list can be said of any class who is inept or annoying on MULTIPLE occaisions.]<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">11-15-2000, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there's a certain dro0d on our server named Mesha.  I first met mesha on my very first time to lower guk.  I was killed by one of the ubertrains this person makes.  Yay, I love Mesha.<br />
<br />
Mesha, THE most annoying dro0d, never apologizing, announcing, or even acknowledging the trains that she causes.  Many a time I've had to sit at the zone cleaning up her messes, only to have her run past in a blazing trail of her level 56 self, only to see Hand, Warlord, both captains, and all the jails.  Had Venril been up, I'm pretty sure I would have seen that in the train.  Come to Sol Ro.  Walk into a zone she is in.  I promise you people will warn the zone that she is there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ha.  She's in a guild too.  Its funny.<br />

<br />
Then of course, the cleric I mentioned previously...   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Can't we do something about these people?  Sheesh.. Retroactive abortion or something.<br />

There is a Shadow Knight on Veeshan (where I play) lets call him...Julie.  So anyway first time I met julie I grouped with him, it was in Crushbone, a he pulls a lego, then when it starts attacking me (a cleric) he disbands and walks away.  His excuse? Oh I'm sorry I was talking to a friend.  One death.  In west commons I see him again...running around with SoW pulling a hg through Druid ring...nice... Two Deaths. Crushbone again...trains the entire castle spawn plus dvinn.  Thank god for divine aura. Death averted.  Anyone to put it lightly this guy is someone you avoid like you would avoid trakanon while naked and ungrouped.<br />
<br />
An important thing is though, that people like some of these druids and others are on every server. Just play smart and don't group with em  <br />
