<br />
<br />
He is a friend, but has been killing elves, dorfs, and druids, ...<br />
<br />
the bet goes,...I win duel, he stops<br />
he wins duel, I have to keep rezzing him and be nice<br />
<br />
<br />
He is twinked to the gills, and he would prefer no buffs prior to start ( actually he is saying pumice stones are ok, so i wont bother buffing)<br />
<br />
<br />
I am assuming I stun stun, stun, blind, fear ( will be in arena on blue server, fear still sort of works right?)..<br />
<br />
ignore root due to stones?<br />
<br />
how much damage will wrath do :?( it drops to lower amount right?)<br />
<br />
and last but not least, will yaulp help, should i have it in a spell slot to use?<br />
<br />
<br />
( planning on burning down to 2/3, save rest for stuns and heal on me...i am hoping no to have to use more then 2 greater heals, and am afraid to use superior,..if i get that low unbuffed, risking interuppts wont be good)<br />
<br />
any input?</div></div><hr />

Start off by stackin' on th' least useful buffs an' keep goin' 'til ye be gittin' up t' th' best ones.  Yer friend prob'ly be havin' a limited number 'f Pumice Stones.  Even if'n he be hittin' ye with all th' charges off one stone, he prob'ly be missin' a few 'f yer buffs.<br />
<br />
Th' more he be burnin' Pumice Stones on ye, th' less 'e be havin' t' use on 'imself.<br />
<br />
Be bringin' a couple potions 'f 'nvis'bil'ty.  When ye be needin' t' med'tate, blind 'im an' then be drinkin' a potion.  Even if'n 'e be havin' Pumice Stones at that time, 'e'll prob'ly be targittin' 'imself t' git rid 'f yer Flash 'f Light an' no longer be targittid on ye.<br />
<br />
Fer that matter, ye mebbee wantin' t' be bringin' a Pumice Stone 'r two t' be usin' on 'im, jus' in case 'e be buffed up b'forehan'.<br />
<br />
That be what I kin be thinkin' 'f right now.  Brell's blessin's be on ye.<br />

<br />
Remember a monk cant carry alot of stuff, so im betting he has only 1 pumice at the most, so force him to use it all up with roots, blinds, and debuffing you.<br />
<br />
Once the stone is gone, take a dam sheild potion and let him to silly on you. Remember that monks get lots of attacks for less damage each. Low dam, low delay is ideal for using dam sheild potions.<br />
<br />
Also use invis potions, and SOW potions on yourself.<br />
<br />
Use pumice stones on him, too.<br />

At your level you can't expect to reliably channel through his hits. Monks have no bashes though so with high channeling they won't interrupt you that much.<br />
<br />
Monks are weight limited but if this guy is really twinked he'll probably have rather high MR (plat. jacinth rings etc) and then you can't expect to win unless you can maintain a damage shield on yourself.<br />
<br />
If he doesn't have that high MR, just root and nuke him. Make sure you have a lot of wisdom and AC. You can start with much wisdom and when you have burned away some mana, swap for AC gear. Monks have less HPs and thus this tactic should work. At 34-35, Wrath is still a decent nuke.<br />
<br />
My tactics against monks is to let my necromancer friend cast splurt and envenomed bolt on them while I cast divine barrier :-).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also insist on self buffs and put your worst ones on first(endures),this is reasonable since i doubt he would give up mend.(not that he will get to use if he is feared all the time  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif )<br />
