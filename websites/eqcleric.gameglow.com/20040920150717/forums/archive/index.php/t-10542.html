Are these guys worth hunting if you can get a full group?  Do they hit harder than they con?  Do they drop any loot that isn't no rent?<br />

They're ok, just watch the ones with the paddles, those are the healers, and they're dangerous. <br />
<br />
At 30, I've seen these guys wipe out a full group. They're faster than sow, so don't expect escaping to be easy. <br />
<br />
The ones with the books are necros, and once they have a pet up, they can have alot of fun fearing you all over the zone while they shred you  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

This isn't a horror story, ok? I've seen them camped very well, and I've seen them camped poorly. Try to find someone with harmony and pull singles. They have a large aggro range, so back up QUITE A BIT to fight them or all of them will be in the battle before you know it.</div></div><hr />
