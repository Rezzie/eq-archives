I have been with a group in the tiny library looking room in the house in unrest, and it is fairly safe, as long as someone good is pulling to the room.<br />
<br />
Are there any other spots good to camp in unrest at my level.  This is normally with a 6 person group.<br />

The one experience I had at unrest (4 days) I died multiple times each day with exception of the first day (didn't die any).  I think unrest is good for lower levels 10-15 and then higher level 26+.  The mid levels around 16-25 are kinda rough for the things you have to fight to get decent xp are tough and can wipe out a party in a hurry.  I personally chose to tough out the crowds in oasis and made lots of good xp there.  You can also find a group in highkeep doing the goblins.</div></div><hr />

Problem is getting up there. If Unrest is heavily Camped then it would be no problem getting up there. But to be on the safe side i would invis vs undead the group and go up that way. Once up there you only have to worry about trains you start. And if you have to zone you can jump off the roof for 5-10dmg and run to zone. <br />

<br />
I went to Unrest at level 16, and have been having a great time in there -- only died once.  I'm now level 17 and still hunting in Unrest whenever I get to play.  With a full group, level 16-20, you can get great experience by going around the house and sitting in the back room (the one with the pillars at the entrance).  This room spawns some ghouls and dark bone skeletons every 20 minutes.  Once you clear the room, you can pull quite easily from the first floor, and everybody in the group should get good experience here.  I went from 16 to 17 in one session (about 5 hours), plus had some bronze and FS weapons to sell.  I plan on staying here for quite a few levels.</div></div><hr />

Luckily, It has NEVER taken me more than 2 min. to find a group there.  Many times, I feel bad because I know too many people in there and I can't group with all of them!<br />

Normally I play with my friends and guildmates, which means I know exactly the abilities and actions each of them possess.  The biggest problem in Unrest is how people deal with being trained.  If you have a cool-headed group, you can profit from trains(my friends and I have now taken to derailing those troublesome trains).  My best advice is to carefully select a group, perhaps even one a few levels higher than you.  Then, as long as you have some good (and knowledgable) pullers, it wont matter where you are, you will get the experience.  Good luck!<br />

If your group can handle a couple of drybones at a time this place is for you. The hard part is getting up there. It only takes one idiot in the group to train the whole house to the roof on the way up. The roof is safe to med up after a battle also<br />

It's not as crazy as it sounds.  I have actually been getting decent experience, 2 bubbles in about an hour, doing this.  How to do it, heavy use of Invis VS Undead.  Invis yourself and then look in the &quot;porch&quot; room or back room.  As long as you don't pull anything from the hallway's near the front, you shouldn't have too much trouble.  It's not for everyone, and it takes a little getting used to, but it is do-able.  I wouldn't try it any lower than 20, too much yard trash gets attracted.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domanic</div><div class="date">11-16-1999, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Unrest is great for Clerics, lots of Undead, Great XP, Bronze and FS from the CGs and Drys.  However I must say that until you get used to the zone and lean how to avoid trains, Unrest can be a deathtrap for unsuspecting players.<br />
<br />
Having made 2 levels in Unrest I now always pull for the group that I'm in, Crazy you say, well not so.<br />
<br />
<br />
 You can Invis to Undead and scope out the best Mobs.<br />
<br />
 You have Endure Magic, so your less likely to get ghoul rooted <br />
PS: I suggest you pick up a cheap Shiny Brass Shield to help with this too.<br />
<br />
 You have your Divine Armour to Save you when things really get screwed up and you need to run your train to the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I recommend, if no high level players are in the zone, that you stay at the fountains, that way, although it’s harder to pull the good stuff, you have a much easier run to the zone if things go bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeshei</div><div class="date">11-26-1999, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I left the place in a hurry, after wasting some 3 days there. It was terribly difficult for me as a Drow (DE) to get there - and some dwarven merchants kept killing me on zone borders all the time grrr.<br />
<br />
The groups there seem to be made of -mostly- idiots (at least on Tunare). This is the only experience i had wher a group left their only healer die after saving members a$$. Simply noone helped decisively enough to get that undead (to me red) monk off me.<br />
<br />
After 3 days and 6 deaths, I lost lvl 20 to almost half 19... then went away and regained 20 in easy 2 h on crocks in oasis. <br />
<br />
No comparison at all.<br />
<br />
Unrest trains are uncontrollable, people uncoordinated, its a chaos of half-brained nincompoops. One of worst zones I've seen in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirienne</div><div class="date">11-28-1999, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to agree with Yeshei.  Unrest sucks.  (On the Karana server.)  90% of the people in there are idiots, with a capitol ID.  I have been there since I was 15th, and it has taken me around a 2 months to get to 21.  I have lost levels more than I care to remember in here.  The problem?  Where else to go?  Unrest is ideal for clerics of this level, but if you aren't in a group, or in a group full of unreliable people, you are going to level backwards more than forwards.  <br />
