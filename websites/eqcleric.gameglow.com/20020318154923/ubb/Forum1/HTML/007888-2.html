</FONT><HR>I play both a cleric and a ranger and I take immense exception to the comment that it takes minimal intelligence to play rangers.<BR>A ranger at higher levels is much more challenging to play than a cleric,I know this from experience.Yes the ranger was wrong to complain and certainly to make an inflamatory post but I have seen comments in this thread that rival that ignorance purely because someone dared criticise a cleric.<BR>I may be in a minority,having levelled both a cleric and a ranger into their 50's and as such being well aware of the limitations of both classes.<BR>As for tanking and pulling.It is possible for a well equipped ranger to tank most mobs in the area (although I would exlcude protectors from this list)although more healing would obviously be required.I would not recommend it and in this case it would appear that his level of equipment was not up to the job.<BR>If flames are necessary flame his attitude but don't flame his class.<BR>Unless you yourself have a level 55+ ranger and have experienced the way the class changes through the levels and the difficulties associated with playing the class 50+ then any criticism is little more than trolling.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, I sure seem to have upset some folks.<P>I apologize for my harsh language, as much as anything I'll chalk it up to reading what I considered an equally insulting post on what was already a bad day (for strictly RL reasons.)  I am sorry.<P>Anyway, I am going to have my say and then just shut my mouth for a while.  <P>First off, to all of you criticizing me for my opinion due to my level - my main is a 55 Ranger, a fact I have made no secret of in other posts on these boards.  I also occasionally play a 57 Wizard as well as a 54 Rogue for raid situations.  I've also been at the controls of a 56 cleric for one raid; I started this character so I would learn the nuances of the class after this experience.<P>Kerra, a max/min game means this:  maximum advantage for minimum cost.  In EQ terms it can mean many things, but most commonly it is used to refer to the most HP healed for the least Mana consumed.  This approach to the game results in the Holy Trinity of Chanter/Cleric/Warrior.  The power of this combination of characters is undeniable and many people, myself included, consider this to be the single largest flaw in the design of EQ.<P>The point of my post was not to argue with you, it was to insult you, and do it harshly.  Maybe you don't realize it but you're line,      <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>"No offense, but being a warrior, ranger or what not requires the mental intelligence of a monkey.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE>was a totally uncalled for attack on just about everyone who plays EQ. (Do you honestly know anyone who doesn't have ANY melee characters on their account?) <P>I'm a little cooler now and I've apologized but I want to say this.  In your second post you make a lot of valid points, but you really seem to have a tendency toward exageration (not to mention your little barb about hypocrisy at the end there):<BR>      <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>Now honestly since you feel the need to curse at me in 80% of your post, I don't even know why I'm responding to you. However, I do know that I wouldn't want to be playing on your server as much as you wouldn't want to be playing on mine -- mainly because your attitude and unwillingness to discuss in a mature fashion.<P><BR>quote:<BR>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P><I> This portion edited by the writer, Fattima.  I have edited this quote out to respect the wishes of the board administrator.  This quote remains intact in Keraa's first reply to my post, at least as of this posting.</I><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<P>Right I'll do that. I'll tell NASA that you referenced me. But when you say that I have a small minded attitude, implying that you have a large minded attitude, doesn't that make you have a small minded attitude as well? Do me a favor and define two words for me:<BR>----------<BR>Irony<BR>Hypocrisy<BR>----------<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>Well my original post has been edited, but I cursed at you once.  That is <B>ONE</B> time too many but in overall terms constitutes less than 1% of the message. In fact, I think I would be challenged to make a readable sentence with the 80% figure you posted let alone an entire message.  <P>Now tell me, where in your first post do you have the "mature" discussion you are clearly capable of, that you feel I am unable to have? <BR>What I got from your first post was that you think all melees have mental intelligence (as opposed to what other kind of intelligence?) of monkies, clerics don't get any loot, clerics are underappreciated and the "most" challenging class to play.  Oh yeah, and clerics are "gods" who should tell people to "go back to Crushbone where they belong and STFU" and then gate out because they are in a less than optimal situation with a player who is a jerk.<P>To answer your final quetion in the section I just quoted:  No, it doesn't.  I was not implying that I have a large minded attitude, whatever that is.  Generally speaking I try to have an <B>open</B> mind about things, but with the content of your first post it seemed pointless to bother arguing. <P>Finally, despite your well executed attempt to sound reasonable about the Adon first brought up with this thread on your second post, you threw it all away with your closing quip:<BR>      <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>When you start doing real raids AKA not lower guk, share with me your raid experiences. Maybe we can exchange banter back and forth without one party resorting to unintelligent curse words.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE> <P>As I said above, I am well beyond my Lower Guk "raiding" days.  If you mean what you say then don't close your argument's with an insult.<P>I'm sorry for all the hassle this has caused.<P>Admin, since you have edited my original post I would appreciate it if you would edit the offensive section that was quoted in Keraa's reply.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=22247"" TARGET=_blank>Fattima Faithhealer</A> <BR>Level 39 Cleric in the service of Brell<BR>Spirit of the Moon<BR>Innoruuk Server<P><BR>Edited 5x for content, typos and grammar.

</FONT><HR>Silly question, but was the ranger in question wearing RyGorr or Barbed ringmail?  They look alike, but the latter has pretty good AC. <P>From his board postings it does appear that the ranger in question is, erm, not good at making friends and influencing people.<P>I know when my 54 ranger tanks, mostly in experience groups, I start by saying something to the cleric that lets them know that I am aware of ranger strengths and weaknesses.  Then I tell them current ac and hit points, buffed.  Then I warn the chanter that the critters WILL be dotted.  Then I go merrily taunting and rarely lose aggro.  I have had to tell clerics that it is safe to use complete heal on a ranger.<BR>I agree that it sounds like this particular ranger was not well enough equipped to tank these particular critters.  With two clerics I would have been tempted to try a two-person CH rotation, or to draft a druid for fast heals between clerical CH.  Quad 260s is enough to make a ranger cry.<P>Even at the lower levels (Lynet is 40) I have noticed the difference between rangers who dress to tank and rangers who dress in party clothes.  The first actually make superior tanks, simply because they hold aggro so well.  For the second, if there is a better tank in the group I will comment that rez and complete heal take the same amount of mana.  Most of them quickly get better at controlling aggro after they hear that.  If there is no better tank then I know it will be a slower hunt that day because I will be medding.<P>Lynet Beaumains, The Damosel Savage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Wow, this thread got way off of what I expected to see.<P>Few comments I wanted to make, though doubtful anyone will pay them any mind.<P>I think Adon came here to vent, as he felt insulted on something he thought he had adapted to and compensated for pretty well.  Many people have commented on how that 2 deaths, for any puller OR tank are good things.  Someone doing BOTH jobs should be ecstatic with 2 deaths.  Especially so, if they are wearing lower end gear.<P>My first post I tried to share how I deal with a difference in tanks, from what I am used to.  Having to CH a defensive warrior with 5k hp is a LOT different then trying to keep 3k-hp chain class alive.  There is a lot more work needed in communication, timing and preparation.  Any time you are with a tank that you're not familiar with you need to communicate and work on your timing.  *Did that personally last night after my tank died once. *<P>We have a very wide range of people that visit this board.  From uber (points to the sigs containing FoH and Afterlife to name just two) to midlevel to lowbie.  Now, I dont think that we should deride anyone based on level or experience or uberness or lack thereof.  Generally this board is the most insult free one I read.  *Wont even comment on the cesspool of ignorance and flames some Veeshan boards are. *<P>As to the people implying we clerics are whiney or elitist, well it happens.  Sorry to say, but you get that from any PERSON playing any CLASS.  While we may suggest clerics with bad situations "gate" or "revive them" very rarely do I find it actually happening, because as a general whole, clerics are nice people trying to help others.  Thats a common reason for becoming a cleric.  One that many of us do share and try to live by.  We are sensitive people, trying to make a difference and feeling the weight of each failure heavily.  Some of us live in poverty and riddled with guilt just because we do not wish to ask for too much or more then we feel we are entitled to.  *Is speaking solely as to my own feelings. *<P>Many times in the past we have talked about other classes.  The main thought in all those threads were that the class is only as good as the PLAYER.  Weather its who do you want in an ideal group or who don't you group with often.  Sometimes in our defense of fellow clerics we may seem rather harsh to other classes, but deep down we all do know their importance and how valuable any class can be if played well.<P>Peace,<BR>~Cali</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>More 2cp from another ranger/cleric.<P>Adon, if you only lost the MT twice in the arena, especially pulling protectors of Zek and the like, I think you did a great job, regardless of the class of the main tank.  Especially as it sounds as if that wasn't your regular hunting group.<P>On the other hand, the only times I've hunted in the arena, we've had either an SK OR a ranger as MT.  I didn't see much difference in MT survivability rates.  However, I usually am not the cleric for the MT group, and at times have even been playing a ranger, so I'm not sure how much harder the MT group cleric had to work.  But the deaths were usually not the fault of a slow CH, but rather things like the puller eating a death rather than train the group with a bad pull.  Or things hitting the fan, and the cleric was torn between keeping the chanter alive and the MT alive.<P>With respect to difficulty in playing either class, having played both, they can be both be difficult but for different reasons.  On the cleric side, the level of responsibility is so high sometimes, it's almost like a job.  I've already got a job in real life, I play games to relax and enjoy.  And it can be tough to do that sometimes as a cleric, and what happened to Adon is a prime example of that, no matter how much you enjoy keeping people alive.<P>Playing a ranger is a lot more fun, although quite challenging as well.  It takes some effort for a ranger to avoid aggro, even though the MT in my groups is usually a level 59 SK, and my ranger just hit level 53.  While I'm trying to avoid aggro, at the same time, I'm trying to keep my aggro up high enough so that I can grab it quickly if necessary to save the chanter or cleric.  I've got two systems and so can play both characters at once, but my second system is not laid out conveniently.  I can play my cleric on it, but not my ranger.<P>With respect to the min/max thing, it's a no brainer that a heavy metal tank, one with the most HPs and ACs, makes a better MT theoretically (although I'd look askance at a warrior using a two-hander).  On a practical basis, if a ranger is the MT, it's because he or she was the best available.  You have two choices then.  You can say "hmmm, this could be an interesting challenge."  Or you can say "hmmm, this is gonna be too hard, I'm gonna find something easier to do."<P>Again, kudos to you, Adon, for accepting the challenge, and sorry to hear that it only caused you grief.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Tommara, Level 55 Cleric<BR>Tommar, Level 53 Ranger<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wow.  Very heated folks here. See if I go and get sick again and don't read for a few days.<P>I'm going to put my 2 cents in.  I have a LOT of experience with ranger tanked groups.  You see, I started on Druzzil Ro because a coworker and his wife (ranger and monk, very squishy) had been playing for a month or so and had no healers. Grouping was an option, but hey at level 9 you know how hard it can be to find good ones.  So they asked me to play. I switched servers (and classes) and started Bram.<P>54 (almost 55) levels later, over a year and a half, I am still playing with the ranger.  His wife has moved on to other games, but the ranger is quite often my main tank (1 yellow from 59 now).  And yes, he is a tank.<P>I realized very quickly that gear was far more important to a melee than it is to a caster.  True, we need Wis (or Int as the case my be) and true some AC is nice.  It is also true that the type of gear needed varies  through the levels.  But basically I took the attitude that if I make the ranger better by helping him get gear then MY life is simpler.  Because of that this ranger is very well equipped.<P>Adon's stupid ranger's mistake was being so poorly equipped.  A little effort would get him better than ry'gorr.<P>We do kael arena runs with less than 2 groups with the ranger maintanking.  Generally speaking we have little trouble with anything.  I can push him to about 1110 AC, nearly 3800 HP.  With his epics he does 3000 dpm.  With my MoK and MoR, his damage shield(s) and regen, his snare and root, we can do pretty amazing things.<P>As has been said before, it is how the classes are played, not what the classes are. I have had the great good fortune to play with 4 incredible rangers.  Two of them are in Sirensa's guild, Hoss.  One is my coworker.  The last is languishing in an uberguild that doesn't allow him the gear he deserves, but he is still capable of great feats because of his intelligence and his knowledge of the class.  Good rangers do exist out there. Good rangers CAN tank.<P>Good rangers also know when not to tank. Tormax is not an options, NToV is not an option, and so on.  But in those situations, there will BE a warrior to tank and we aren't really talking about raid situations, are we?<P>So to those who avoid ranger tanked groups at all costs, I say you are mistaken.  Find a good ranger and you'll be amazed how smoothly things go.<P>Bram Bullroarer<BR>54 Vicar of Brell<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Dang...big discussion here...<P>Like to add my two cents. It's not easy keeping a ranger alive when they are the main tank, not because they suck or anything.<BR>About the only ranger I use Complete Heal on is a 60 ranger friend of mine in like full North ToV armor. <P>But some rangers are idiots (but there are idiots of every class)...I admit it, they think they can tank and tank and tank and go into the hard places. Good rangers are hard to come by but there are some. Rangers can be very good dmg dealers if they know their stuff but others, i wouldn't want in my group over a warrior.<P>Read the flame on Adon...You seem like a very good cleric to keep him alive for so long and him only leaving with 2 deaths. I've been main healer at Arena raids and it's hard to keep some warriors alive there. I have a slow pc and I've told people this and they still want me as their main healer.. /boggle I've gotten called a bad cleric in my time too, usually cuz of lag or a mistimed CH.<P>Walk away from this proud, Adon, that you kept that guy alive like you did and it was wrong to say you were a PoS cleric. If i played on your server, i'd talk to the guy.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>---Yowzie Wowzie---<BR>59 Cleric of Innoruuk<BR>    &lt;--Tunare--&gt;<BR>"Most people suck so they usually blow it."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ease up, Keraa *hugs*.  Not everybody is flaming ya.  Most of us are just trying to explain.  Yes, there are a few harsher than most, but perhaps time to take those to tells (or whatever this board's equivalent is      <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">)<P>But I think you raised some very good points which warrant public discussion:<P>     <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Keraa:<B>I like playing my cleric.  Its a challenging class to play.

I mean, if adding a cleric to the group makes everything easy, regardless of the talents of the group, then the game is too easy, right?<P>So the game has to be designed so that clerics sometimes fail.  But there are backstops built in, chanters mez, shaman slow, etc.  Tanks who are supposed to hold aggro do so, secondary tanks stay secondary until it's time for them to move up...<P>Problem is, when these backstops fail, it's the cleric who gets the blame.<P>I doubt if anyone here disagrees with you there, at least, as you noted, who've played a cleric to high levels.  It's much easier for clerics to keep people alive under 50, even if their group is incompetent. At higher levels, we haven't a chance unless everyone else plays their part well.  But if they don't, we get the the blame.  <P>It is indeed a high price to pay for playing a cleric.  <P>So I don't blame you for being angry.

Fattima exists because I wanted to learn how to play a cleric from the ground up.  Is Fattima a twink? Sure, but I have played her every step of the way learning the class as I went.

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Adon:<BR><B><BR>Being the highest cleric there, they put me on healing the main "tank".<P>I soon discover that this is a level 60 ranger!  There was also no monks to pull. So the ranger would pull. Sigh. This was not a well equipped ranger either, I believe he had some Ry'gor and possibly some fear gear, with a smattering of Thurg armor.<P>The next closest thing to a tank was a level 52 warrior who's gear was no better.  Anyway, when the protectors of zek and other 55+ giants starting coming in, healing this guy was extremely tough.  Complete Heal was not fast enough, and Divine Light and remedy was the only tools I had (still 58 so no CE and Cel Heal is too slow and weak).<P>Long story short, he died twice during the 2 hours or so we were there, and later flamed me on our server boards for being a "PoS cleric"<P>Adon<BR>58th Templar<BR>Zebuxoruk<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Others have already said this, but I have to agree that you did a good job if he only died twice, especially if he was also pulling.  Pullers can die a lot in a normal raid anyways, especially ones without the Feign Death skill.<P>It might have been a good idea to have secondary healers drop a couple quick heals so you could have gotten off Complete Healings.  I don't know the composition of your raid so that may not have been an option for you.<P>Rangers can be really good at holding taunt if they want to.  They have nice debuffs that let them do so.  Of course, they generally don't have the HP or AC of a similarly equipped warrior or plate-class hybrid, so cleric Complete Heals won't be as efficient on them as they could be.<P>A level 52 warrior may have had a hard time keeping aggro since Taunt for him wouldn't work on level 53+ monsters.  Aside from his weaponry, that's the only effective way a warrior can maintain aggro.<P>Well-equipped rangers <B>can</B> tank, but it is generally agreed upon that well-equipped warriors, paladins, and shadow knights tank <B>better</B>.<P>I play a level 60 ranger and a level 55 cleric, and I have played both in raid situations so I know what I am talking about.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
