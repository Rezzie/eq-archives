In the field are undead scarecrows, you must have magic to attack them so we are the perfect scarecrow killing machines.  At about level 16 with full buffs, your summoned hammer,( I'm using a Blood Forge Hammer) and expulse undead you should be able to solo the crows.  Mem sense undead, your buffs, and expulse undead, and have your hammer.  The crows do not attack and won't help each other..use sense undead until you find one that cons blue and have at it.  I have tried stun, spook undead, and root and really haven't found much of an advantage...you seem to be better off just pounding it out.  Some of these guys hit harder then others and occasionally you will find one that stuns / fears you so often you can't get expulse to fire and you will lose, but they are rare.  I tend to level about every 4 hours doing the crows and have gone from 14 to 19 on them...lousy loot but good exp.  Also, you will find bags of hay in the field, give those to Heninia (SP?) Miller and she will give you exp and a couple copper.  She is normally in the hut on the West side of the field.  Kill a crow then run to the river on the South side of the field and med sitting on the dirt...nothing will attack you.  Repeat...:-)  Don't med in the field, every bear / wolf / lion wandering by will attack you...I have been told I will continue to get exp till lvl 22.</div></div><hr />

I have been rooting and nuking with no problems.  I prefer to not to melee them as I get mana back faster than health. I have been able to even take on whites at level 17.  I agree that once in a while you will run in to a nasty crow that will beat on you and stun you often.  I found if I stunned, rooted, then ran west along the river they will not follow you.  I rest up at the barbarian village and then go back and finish em off.<br />
There are enough spawns to keep a 2-3 people busy, but if you rest along the river by the cabin there is one that spawns close so you don't have to run around so much.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting<br />
