<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kami</div><div class="date">05-01-2000, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have read many threads on the cleric exp reses.  Many different ideas and thoughts and opinions stated.  <br />
<br />
Here's my 2 coppers worth.<br />
<br />
In my guild or a friend I've met virtually?  Sure I'll give you a res...just help me get there...I'm kinda a slow.<br />
<br />
If I don't know you, why do you think I owe you the 500 mana it requires?  10 plat...that's my fee.  You pay it freely to go were you wish instantly from druids and wizards alike.  It's the only way I have to make money and sitting there getting the mana back from the res and a free heal for the effects give me something for my time.<br />
<br />
I think this is fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos Inglorion</div><div class="date">05-03-2000, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, sir, 10 plat is nice, but normally people pay me 20 to 50 plat for a resuscitate.  I don't even have to set a price, that seems to be the going range on my server.  Do I refuse?  Only if it seems apparent that paying would be a hardship.  I need the coin.  Wisdom gear is not cheap, and no, I can't go camp my own stuff, I'm a casual player who wants to get a new level every once in a blue moon.<br />
People get back their investment in me because I can build a bigger mana pool and by getting free reagent buffs from me.<br />
Sheesh, wizards charge 10 plat per person for group teleports, and I usually pay 2 platinum for a SoW or more for clarity.  Clerics are UNDERpaid by those standards of mana usage.<br />
Naturally, my group and/or guild will never have to pay a dime, and if I'm grouped when I do a rez, I split the money with the group.  It's their mana pool too, at least temporarily.<br />
I won't feel guilty about charging for rezzes until teleports and such are free, and people supply their own reagents for symbol spells, and maybe not even then.  <br />
My guild's biggest cleric thinks it is unethical to charge for rezzes.  I respect his opinion but I can't agree.  Maybe I starved as a cleric too long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">05-05-2000, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Preset standards never work. I would love to be able to res everyone all the time when its needeed and for free. Time and mana wont permit this. Sometimes I NEED the cash. Sometimes I dont need the cash and I'll do it for free. Sometimes, after I run across the continet to res yer ass I feel I am entitled to something. I never ask for a donation. If I expect to be paid I will ask to be paid. Asking for donations is like begging in tells. Am I a bad cleric because I take money from people for using a spell that doesnt cost me anything? No. Its thier choice. If they want it that bad then they will get it. <br />
My response to res questions...Thats a definite maybe. shuts most people up.<br />
O yeah, saw a 45 sk lookin for a 49 res. just lost his level and was payin 1k for it back.<br />
