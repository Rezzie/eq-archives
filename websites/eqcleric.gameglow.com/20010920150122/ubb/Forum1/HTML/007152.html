</FONT><HR>Greetings and Salutations fellow Everquest Holy Priest and Priestess'.<P>I have lurked for a very long time and look forward to an interactive posting experience with most of you here.  I place myself before all of you today to inspect my equipment choices and make constructive suggestions as to possible upgrades.  I have chosen most of my gear with an eye towards survivability (HP/AC) with the Wisdom as mostly an afterthought.  I have not been very lucky with Ethereal Mist drops in Hate and have abstained on all rolls in which I felt I had a superior piece of equipment.  I find myself in a world that my resist are coming more into bear and look forward to possibly consolidating a few items to give me enough resist to survive as well as the wis/AC needed.  The first equipment item listed is my primary item with any secondary item listed as a swap in piece for a particular situation (ie resist or full mana mode).  I will also list my full unbuffed stats so that you can get an overview as to my total character.<P>Ear1: Forrest Loop AC2 dex3 agi3 wis3<BR>Neck: Sebilite Scale Neckguard AC8 mana40 cold2 pois2 / Goblin Soul Caller Wis5 mag10<BR>Face: Bone mask of the Jarsath AC7 str2 wis4 dis5 pos5 / Velium ruby veil / gold diamond mask<BR>Helm: Guardian Helm AC11 sta5 wis5 hp20 mana20 dis5 pois5<BR>Ear2: Forrest Loop AC2 dex3 agi3 wis3 / Fishbone earring dex3 effect enduring breath<BR>Ring1: Diamond Wedding band AC2 dex3 int5 wis5 mana 15 fire8 cold8<BR>Ring2: Velium Fire wedding band AC6 HP65 / Velium Jasper / Velium Diamond Wedding Ring<BR>Wrist1: Donals Bracer AC16 / Guardian bracer AC9 dex3 sta3 hp10 mana10 fire5 cold5 mag4<BR>Wrist2: Bracer of the Reverant AC9 wis5 <BR>Arms: Donals Vambraces AC21<BR>Hands: Guantlets of the Black AC15 str4 wis3<BR>Shoulders: Adamantite Epaulets AC9 wis7<BR>Chest: Guardian Breastplate AC22 str7 sta7 fire5 mag5<BR>Back: Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak AC20 hp25<BR>Waist: Belt of Cenobite AC5 wis7 cold10<BR>Legs: Guardian Leggings AC12 str4 cha5 wis4 hp15 fire15 cold15 mag5<BR>Feet: Donals Boots AC21 / Royal Frosted Velium AC19 mag5<BR>Primary1: Dark Ember Dam13 Del32 str2 wis5 mana20 hp20 fir7<BR>Shield: Clay Guardian Shield AC25 hp50<BR>Range: Seal of Thoridain AC2 wis3 int3 mana30 cold3 mag3<P>My unbuffed stats in normal gear mode (ie. for an exp hunt)<BR>STR 89<BR>STA 87<BR>AGI 86<BR>DEX 79<BR>WIS 174<BR>INT 100<BR>CHA 93<P>SAVES:<BR>POISON 28<BR>MAGIC 38<BR>DISEASE 26<BR>FIRE 60<BR>COLD 63<P>HP 1244<BR>AC 886<BR>ATK 735<P>WT 97/89 !!<P>As you can see I am encumbered when I leave the bank so any items with lower wt. or additional str are a nice bonus.  I can get my self buffed AC to almost 950 and my HP over 2500.  I also have an aversion to the backwards ballcaps that hi-elfs are forced into so for any helm suggestions, I would prefer a non-graphic item.  <P>I have no true Velious Faction.  I have hunted in Skyshrine much and my faction with CoV can get no lower.  I have also hunted Giants and one of the factions there is also trashed.  The other giant faction, oddly enough, has me warmly but I am sure this will change as my guild is looking forward to switching to a full dwarf faction.  My dwarf faction has me indifferent to guards yet dubious to the merchants.  Not sure how to raise that one up yet.  I refuse to hunt PoG as I can not see defiling Mother Tunare's playground.<P>I have about 5K pp with which to play as well as a core of low to mid 50's guild friends that hunt together almost exclusively.  We are looking at upgrading all of our tanks as well so any suggestions for hunting grounds will be appreciated as well. <P>Thank you very much for your time and your consideration,<BR><P>------------------<BR>Zardnok Anansi<BR>54th Vicar<BR>Officer of Evening Reign<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Thanks Cali!<P>I am supposed to be receiving a blue diamond earring made with the loot from our last excursion into Hate.  It seems as though I have absolutely NO luck up top in the planes!  I have only ever seen one pair of EM legs drop and even though I won the roll on them someone else looted them.  I have never seen a BP drop and most of the other items I have abstained on to allow others that needed the upgrade to loot them.<P>I didn't think of the froggy crown!  That is a nice upgrade in AC and it will replace the saves I will lose by swapping out my Pants.  Maybe I can get lucky in ECMart as I don't have the stomach to do the Paw quest.  I helped out 3 of my druid buddies with it back when I was in my 30's and swore I would never subject myself to that kind of boredom.  It also explains my aversion to Grimrot and the Aegis of Life quest.<P>I have been actively camping in Sebilis to try and get my group to go and try to camp the Sebilite Legs and maybe even a Sebilite Chestpiece.  As most things, I try to make everyone happy and choose the camp that has "something for everyone".  We have also been trying to outfit a pally friend so have been hitting all of the Deepwater drops in Sebilis as well.<P>I also hadn't thought about the Grim Pauldrons.  I have been trying to make it up to air once a week or so to hope to get lucky with a Wt. of the Gods.  I would love to have a set of Imbued Granite Spaulders as well, but alas my dice in that department have been a tad deficient!  We had a run of lucky bards last time we got any of those to drop and all of our bards ended up winning the rolls on spaulders.  At least they can sing some kind of Strength song so they can carry all that extra weight!<P>I would also like to upgrade my gaunts as well to the Crystal Chitin Gaunts.  The strength and AC there would be an upgrade and the mana on the CCG would pretty much wash with the Gauntlets of the Black.<P>I guess you did pick up on the fact that I hate to be mismatched.  I wore Cleric quest gold armor exclusively until I was level 50.  I would love to be able to fill out my Donal's gear, but Trakanon wasn't very kind to us last time we went deep.  If I could just find some grey pants, I could maybe try to fake it with a Dusty BP on my chest.  Alas, when I try to factor in my fashion sense with my choices things get really whacked out!<P>Thanks again for your time and suggestions Cali!  Time for me to try some auctions!<P>  <P>------------------<BR>Zardnok Anansi<BR>54th Vicar<BR>Officer of Evening Reign<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hunt the WW's.  Dragon killing is fun and if your guild is geared similiarly to yourself then lot's of people will benefit from it.  One group of 55+'s can take the nest dragons around the north ridge... but two or more groups will ofcourse do nicely.<P>You'd be wanting a back (the seahorse is nice, but ouch on the wight) bracer (or two) and one of the Tailsman's....  stun command also drops often enough, as do other Velious 50+spells.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>To be fashionable, dont forget the EB BP.  Lovely black plate look with 25 ac.<P>I wear it now with my Donals legs, arms, bracer to create a very stunning image.  Though it also looks good with Seb Scale or Jarsath.  Of course my green boots and gloves just hint at things to come (think accessory) and also look good matched with my new Fungi Robe.<P>As for paws, well, I camped mine at a young age and was helped by many friends.  But on Veeshan you see them selling for like 4k now.  So keep your ears open to those /auc's!<P>I wear my grim pauldrons to help with the overburdened issues.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  Especially when I dumped my Vel Ruby Veil for the Jarsath Bone mask permenantly.<P>Also, as a creative way to get a STR boost, save your Giant Meat and bake it into steaks.  They give str and sta (2-4pts) when baked with Omithar Ingredents and eaten "naturally".  So take up baking and put them in your first pack to enjoy anytime.  <P>Good luck!<P>------------------<BR><B>~Calimayrn Anam'Cara</B><BR>Templar of Tunare<BR><B>~Calizana Rhinelander</B><BR>Floating Barbarian Champion<BR>Farstorm ~ Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>OK, I am the proud wielder of a dolly!  Got the Paw last night for 1750pp and a diamond.  It increased my actual AC by 16 pts and wis by 4 points while only decreasing my HP by 6.  I am still trying to get used to not having my hammer.  I always enjoyed smacking stuff with it when I was full mana and things were under control.<P>My baking skill is 135ish so the giant steaks are a great idea to help out with my encumbrance issue.  The weight issue is not as important to me as most others, although sometimes when you are running for your life from some big bad guy it stinks to be a step slower than your friends.  It is the old African adage of; "You don't have to outrun the lion, you just have to outrun the next slowest person!"<P>I will continue to try and come up with an alternative for my chest and legs.  Looks like it is back to Seb for some more Armsman and Pickler camps.  I have a Hate raid planned next Tuesday so maybe I can get lucky up top!  If I can at least get my legs upgraded I may swap over to the EBBP.  I almost bought one last night but stopped for some reason.  Also had a deal on Worked Dragonleg Breeches that I passed up as well.  Sometimes I think my own indecision is my downfall.  I just couldn't see dumping all of my cash reserves into just one set of pants!  Maybe if I had been lucky unloading some of my excess looted gear for plat, I would have felt better about emptying my entire bank account.<P>I tried to buy the froggy crown last night as well.  Everyone seemed to agree via shouted price checks that 1kpp was the average price on the crown yet noone wanted to sell one for that.  Not even close as no other hat can be had for that price with that kind of AC and saves.  Alas, maybe I need to suck it up and offer what ever is needed to get the drop I need.<P>Thanks again to everyone for suggestions.  We have hunted in Sirens Grotto a number of times and it is just a skip away to WW and the dragons with the goodies!!  I have also been looking into hitting Dragon Necropolis zone area for some of the "yard trash" loot that seems to blow away most of my current guilds gear.<P>------------------<BR>Zardnok Anansi<BR>54th Vicar<BR>Officer of Evening Reign<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007152&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007152&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
