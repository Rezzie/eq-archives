I'm partnered with a 45 Druid and can go just about anywhere.  We're on Coldain/Skyshrine faction if that helps at all.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated... the key here is that we need to get through 45 as quickly as we can.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
KC can be mad xps if done right. Get a good pulling monk in his mid-50s who knows how to build aggro on everything around him, a decent Shammy and Enchanter and you and you can hold LCY or RCY for days. Your monk might even luck into a TStaff (thought that's unlikely).<br />
<br />
Velks is doable at 45, but you had best BYOG as the existing groups there will want someone with a 49 rez.</div></div><hr />

The last time I went there I saw a lot of creatures roaming around.  Any suggestions on a good camp spot where there aren't any adds?  Also what camp in SolB were you guys doing?  I did the King room awhile back with my chanter, it took me 9 hours to get two yellows in 45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">12-27-2001, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't tried the druid/cleric combo myself (I prefer a mage).<br />
But take a shot at the Bloodgill goblins inside the lake in Lake of Ill Omen. I got some mad xp there in my 40's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerycho</div><div class="date">12-27-2001, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rosieana - King in SolB is too low for a 45 in a full group. Though you and another 45 tank could hold it just fine. At 45, though, that is a loot camp not an xp camp. You need to be doing BnB or LDC in SolB for solid xps at 45. <br />
<br />
Tundar, I can't believe that I forgot about the Bloodgills! They are mad xps! The ZEM (zone experience multiplier) for LOIO is 100 - same as all newbie zones, this makes it VERY profitable to kill in and you're right, the Bloodgills are a great xp train. Basic tactics - EB everyone and go to the top of the underwater dome. Go down one of the sides and start swimming around the ridge at the base of the dome (not the base of the building). At each corner there will be a spawn of 2 bloodgills. Slaughter those two, then move to the next corner. Easy, relatively safe, increadible xps!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">12-28-2001, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, it's important to note that there were just the two of us duoing this camp-any more than that and the exp would have most likely sucked. It's location three on this map: http://www.eqatlas.com/nagafenslairmap.html <br />
<br />
On Drinal, it's called Tiger cause of the tiger print graphics on the wall and floor. Just make sure you debuff the SoWed mobs-one runner making it to bats and life becomes ALOT more difficult...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarconeth</div><div class="date">01-01-2002, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for your wonderful suggestions. I tried a few of them but found something completely different that worked very well.<br />
<br />
With my 45 Druid partner, we went to Katta Castellum and hunted in the graveyard.  We'd pull 'em out and park them just outside of the graveyard, 2 dots from me and 2 from her.  Easy, easy, easy.  Worked out to be about a blue every 20-30 minutes with no risk involved at all.<br />
