<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">06-22-2000, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, I'm angry.<br />
<br />
Last night I logged in, and did some housekeeping at the bank, then had a friend make a level 1 DE Chanter to buy me some hate stones.<br />
<br />
After my little shopping trip, I gated back to the Dreadlands and got a group in Karnors almost right away with some folks I used to group with way back when. (A little Gnomie Magician, aren't they so cute? and a Ranger, druid, etc....)<br />
<br />
We are in the right corner in Karnor's.<br />
<br />
I arrive and ask if anyone has Hero/Reso/SLN/Sheild of words on, so I don't waste mana on overwriting buffs.<br />
<br />
I ask again.<br />
<br />
No response.<br />
<br />
Ok, ResoX6, and ShieldX6. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your spell doesn't take hold.&quot; X 5 times out of 12 times.<br />
<br />
Note to self- (angry now) when in group, first buff cast is nullify magic, since to one seems to listen when I ask a little question.<br />
<br />
Mana at 10%, I announce to the group &quot;mana at 10% LOW&quot;<br />
<br />
Ranger: &quot;Pulling now, OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;Mana at 10% LOW LOW LOW&quot;<br />
<br />
Ranger: &quot;inc&quot;<br />
<br />
Ranger at 1 bub health before hes even in healing range<br />
<br />
Ranger: &quot;omg, zone&quot;<br />
<br />
Alliliel begins to cast a spell!<br />
A_Ranger's wounds fade away.<br />
<br />
Alliliel Zones!<br />
<br />
Alliliel tells the group &quot;I'm really enjoying how no one answered my silly little buff question, and then decided to pull when I had no mana. Is this thing on? /tap microphone&quot;<br />
<br />
Med a while.<br />
<br />
Zone back in.<br />
<br />
A_Ranger says &quot;Im back at the corner! HELP! HELP!&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, I zone into someone else's train and cant even get clear of the zone, much less to the right corner to help the ranger.<br />
<br />
I'm going to feel horrible if the ranger dies, so I at least wanted to let him know why there would be no help forthcoming, I'm running back to the other zone in Karnors (sometimes the monsters just hit you if you are nearby, and dont chase you, if you hunt in Karnors you know what i mean) seeing if the monsters are chasing me or if they were just hanging at the zone.<br />
<br />
They are chasing me! I'm running and trying to type at the same time, &quot;Cant help, train at zone&quot;<br />
<br />
Blah, Stupid Alli doesnt check her own stupid HP bar enough.<br />
<br />
YOU have been slain by a Drolvarg Rager less than 1 inch from the zone! YOU are an idiot!<br />
LOADING PLEASE WAIT....<br />
<br />
Son of a gun.<br />
<br />
While I'm memming spells in the dreadlands, ranger zones out at 1 bub.<br />
<br />
Ranger says &quot;omg, what a train!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alliliel says &quot;Has anyone in this group heard a word I've said? Is anyone out there? Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mage says &quot;zoning in!&quot;<br />
Ranger says &quot;zoning in&quot;<br />
Paladin says &quot;zoning in!&quot;<br />
Druid says &quot;zoning in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Alright, I guess I'll go in too.<br />
<br />
My body is RIGHT at the zone. Drats, almost made it.<br />
<br />
Zone is clear.<br />
<br />
I always tell the group when im casting res  on myself so they dont think I'm getting killed. (Not that this group seemed to think I even existed.)<br />
<br />
Ranger says &quot;Im back at the corner&quot;<br />
Alliliel tells the group &quot;Ressing myself now&quot;<br />
Alliliel begins to cast a spell.<br />
Ranger says &quot;OMG, ZONE!!!!!&quot;<br />
Ranger shouts &quot;CHOO CHOO&quot;<br />
Message box &quot;Someone wishes to RESSURECT you. Is this ok?&quot;<br />

<br />
THE LOUSY DROLVARGS HIT ME RIGHT INTO THE ZONE BEFORE I COULD HIT THE YES BUTTON.<br />
<br />
THE MESSAGE BOX WAS FROZEN RIGHT THERE ON MY SCREEN AS THE ZONE LOADED!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Alliliel tells the group &quot;Well that's just great.&quot;<br />
<br />
A_Ranger says &quot;WOW, what a train! hehe&quot;<br />
<br />
Alliliel /punts stupid ranger all the way back to Kelethin.<br />
<br />
Alliliel removes herself from the group.<br />
<br />
A Ranger says &quot;What's wrong? Come back and get xps.&quot;<br />
<br />
You tell the Ranger &quot;What xps? I'll go solo Ragers in the Dreadlands, It's GOT to be better than that group of yours. bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
A Ranger shouts &quot;need cleric for karnors&quot;<br />
<br />
Alliliel meds to full, buffs up and seeks some stuff to take some vengeance on.<br />
<br />
I spy a Drachnid Recluse! Blue to me! Immobilize, Retribution, Retribution, Retribution.<br />
<br />
Recluse near death!<br />
<br />
All of a sudden..<br />

<br />
First:  ICK!!  Sorry to hear this happened to you, especially being bumped out of the zone without the Res.<br />
<br />
Second:  This is exactly why I will not hunt in Karnor.  The trains there are just horrible, plus this zone seems to suffer from the hatelist propogation &quot;feature&quot; introduced with Karnuk.  <br />
<br />
And your right.  XP is a lot better solo.  At 46, I was getting about a bubble of xp at the undead ruins in DL in about 4 hours.  I spent 4 hours with a group of people (most of whom were lower level than I), and I got maybe a quarter of a bubble.<br />
<br />
(Ok.  So that is 3 things.  Just because you were a math major in college doesn't necessarily mean that you can count.)<br />

2nd mistake was not making them reply to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanar</div><div class="date">06-24-2000, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm....Sounds familiar.  Mind you, I got in a similar type of group, where the enchanter left it to the Necro to mesmerise the mobs when we were overrun.<br />
<br />
Now, when I see the group overrun, I tell them to zone and I run, unless I see a message that someone is messing.<br />
<br />
I will try to keep the party alive till they zone. If they ignore the advice of the party cleric, there is no hope for them.<br />

(First the cloak of flames issue in Sol, now these idiots? Did you do something bad, and now that karma's catching up with you?) Hope you don't hate me because of it, but that was pretty freaking hillarious, while being so sad. (Ok, so I'm a bit of a sadist.) <br />
Daine is right tho, the zeroes should have said something. If I start buffing people and get more than 1 or 2 DNTH's I just skip that spell entirely...I figure that if whoever cast it on a few people and nobody else started yelling for it, they don't need it.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

I wasnt talking about buffing. If the party doesnt feel like talking to the cleric then the party obviously doesnt need one.<br />

Actually I usually have pretty good groups! It's just every once and a while I get a bunch of jokers instead of some nice people.<br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">06-26-2000, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reminds me of the time in oasis as a newbie with my paladin before the sand giants got squashed within a few seconds.<br />
<br />
eek someones training it on the peir.  Swim Swim eek its coming towards me.Death.<br />
<br />
I run all the way back from freeport and drag my corpse to the peir and begin looting again with an eye out for sg.<br />
<br />
Omg another one heading for the peir....let me stop looting me corpse...omg I cant get up.  SG starts to pummel me whilst looting me corpse. <br />
<br />
<br />
Surprising whilst I was a newbie with my cleric I avoided oasis like the plague (prefered sro undead) but one time whilst selling in oasis (me being a dorf and not a inkie) I got hit by a sg and was like about 5 seconds from the zone.<br />
<br />
I come back from loading and see my corpse...its so close to the zone I am very tempted to loot it out in the open.  Then memories begin to stur of the SG peir incident so I drag it a few paces towards the zone and get down to looting it (takes a while in lag).  Whilst im looting someone trains spectres to sro (where I was).  I get up whilst they are hitting me press back and zone instantly.  I have like 2hp's when I zone.   So I guess what goes around comes around.  <br />
<br />
Maybe tomorrow you will get hit by trains and just survive :&gt;</div></div><hr />
