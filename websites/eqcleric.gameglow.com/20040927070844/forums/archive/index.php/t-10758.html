<br />
I often get 30 minutes to just pop on and am looking for a spot on the moon to solo. I have also wondered about the Graveyard on Kattas but assume it will be too low. I am looking for a nice dark blue undead mob if possible.<br />
<br />
I think Sun Reavers and such in Scarlet Desert are a littel too tough. They seem to have a lot of HP and pretty high MR.<br />

<br />
I haven't been adventuring much on the moon outside of ME and Grieg's End, so I can't recommend where you should go. But ME is not a place for a 48 cleric to solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Grey, by the SD has alot of skels (Ssiisharr are undead too)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andav</div><div class="date">01-14-2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an FYI, the mobs in the Graveyard in Kattas are about 60% dark blue and 40% light blue to me at 48. It is a nice little spot for a pop in and kill a few things then log type session. Cash loot is pretty bad but they drop these No Drop Lore skin pieces which I need to look up. I assume they are for an armor quest of some sort. You can pull outside the GY and the Lego &quot;Guards&quot; will not kill the mobs. Usually 4 banishes and a stun or 2 will kill them. They do not hit very hard so I have been letting them beat on me to try to get those last 12 defense skill points. Man that goes slow.<br />
<br />
Edit: The skins are for a Spear quest.<br />

The tribal gatherers/lookouts are a mix of light blue and dark blue to me at 46. 3-4 Retributions do it and they dont hit to hard. Havent paid to close attention but it seems like around 3 mobs to a blue exp bubble so not to bad of exp either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinskey Bab0linskey</div><div class="date">01-14-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried solo'ing in ME this weekend.  At 60 it takes me the better part of a full bar'o mana (210 wisdom, 435+mana, no mana regen) to kill a vampyre bat or drudge skeleton using all 3 dots/root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corinus</div><div class="date">01-19-2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can solo in the Grey at low 50s if you're careful.  Just need to stay clear of the zonelines because people like to train, and you need to have an EB item.  If you don't have an EB item, group up in the Grey for a bit until you can get 3 Shissar organs and you can turn that in for an EB neck.  Though honestly I prefer grouping in Grey over soloing, since you can do both healing and nuking here.<br />
<br />
ME, I don't recommend soloing in.  Not enough undead, and too mean mobs.<br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains are soloable, if you're careful.  Vampyres on the north side.<br />
<br />
Revanents in Scarlet Desert are also undead.  Easy to pull from the west camp near the Grey.  I haven't tried pulling from their fort in the North East corner though.<br />
<br />
And the graveyard in Katta I'd recommend to L50 and below.  Easy pulls, as you spawn each undead manually, and an unlimited number of pulls.  The quest for the pieces are for a spear with AC, and it's not a very good one anyways.  Clerics can't use it in any case, but the spear is tradable. http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1478</div></div><hr />

I *THINK* the rest will be dark blue. As long as root holds, you should be OK.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Also Pathing is really funky on the right side. Things seem chase you to the gate and then teleport back to their spawn spot when you round the corner. You have to let them beat on you just a bit and then back out into the courtyard. Because the down time is substantial, I usually only have to pull from the left side.<br />

I have run through the graveyard a few times and never seen any undead at all  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javara</div><div class="date">02-12-2002, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stern-If you walk along the sidewalk towards the church/building one pops about halfway down and slightly to the left.  I think they are on some sort of timer, but it seems to be fairly quick.  I know another two pop on the farther right side in the graveyard deeper. Not sure if there are any others.<br />
<br />
Sometimes they have popped easy for me, other times I have needed to walk around slowly and stop every so often to get one to pop. Not sure why or if its my imagination or what.<br />
<br />
The two gargoyles on the steps conned dark blue to me when I was 48 and are indifferent. Anyone fight these? If so are they hard and any faction hits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andav</div><div class="date">02-12-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I walk right along the line of grave stones stopping at each spawn spot. Moving back and forth seems to help. They are on a trigger that also has a timer. I am not sure how long the timer is.<br />
<br />
If you walk from the gate toward the church there are 3 on the left and 2 on the right. If you see &quot;Your foot sinks into a weahtered grave.&quot; or &quot;You kicked over some dried flowers&quot; or &quot;You heard digging in front/left/right of you.&quot; You did not trigger a spawn.<br />
<br />
The Gargoyles are real? I did not even think to target them. I assumed they were art! LOL.<br />
