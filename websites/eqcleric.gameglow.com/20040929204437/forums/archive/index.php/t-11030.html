<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alavindrel</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi All,<br />
<br />
Just thought I would share that after you stop getting XP from the NIDs at the Crystal Caverns.  There are 4 Juicy Spectres in......... Wait for it...... The Qeynos Catacombes at the enterence to the bloodsabres guild. :p<br />
<br />
Yep it is a NEWBIE zone and yep you do get the 15% NEWBIE XP bonus and yep they are UNDEAD ;)<br />
<br />
Spent 7 hours there when I was level 38 with a level 38 Paladin, just the 2 of us, we died on the break, GRRR calm is such a waste of mana.  <br />
<br />
Next time we used Enstill and Atone but ended up with 3 To break the spawn, or survive 3 spectres, you can: <br />
<br />
1. Fear the specs and run them back to the injured Rat area, once there you can use Panic the dead till your heart is content or you mana runs dry to keep the combat to one Spec at a time.<br />
<br />
2. Run the Spectres (USING A SOW POTION) to the zone mouth near where Cubert Pops and zone out.  For some reason they can't find their way home and you can pick them off at your leasure.  DO NOT TRY THIS IF NEWBIES ARE CAMPING CUBERT :eek:<br />
<br />
NEVER use fear at the bloodsabres on the Spectres that have already been spooked once before as they go back inside the guild and you end up with 2 level 60 NPC necros.  Not much is worse than siting there with divine armour up knowing you can't run because you have been hit with Immobilise and you can't gate as won't live past the 1st nuke. :(<br />
<br />
Once we had the spawn broken it was 3/4 of a blue bubble at 38 down to just below a 1/4 of a blue bubble about 7 hours later when we dung 44, it was so easy the paladin got her 1HS, 2HS and 2HP skills all maxed.  The paladin was using a Centi War Spear and a FBSS in the break, later changed to a Ghoulbane and later a Nathsar 2HS, You have to love Instrument of Nife Paladins.  I didn't have Turning of the Unnatural until after I dung 39 but the 400 dot made a difference too.  We also took a breather to get her level 40 spells (which is why we know so much about how to break the spawn :rolleyes: ).<br />
<br />
Money is OK, Scathes and gold Pendants go for about 12pp Bronze for about 3pp.  You also get Peridots periodically too, over all we made about 700pp each.  Take a Rallic pack, EE Bag or Burlap as Scathes weigh a lot I think I had about a 240 enc.<br />
<br />
Now you do get bad faction with the Corrupt Qeynos Guard &amp; Bloodsabres but you get good faction with the real Guards, Antonious and the Temple of Life.  It made it really good for buying my 44th spells as my faction was warm which I think saved me about 30pp.<br />
<br />
After that, off to the Dreadlands</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scaredHalfling</div><div class="date">11-21-2002, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW with out new Lull abilities I was able to solo the 4 specs here without much trouble.  I would have to cast SHeal on my self once or twice per battle, all dependent on enstill breaking or resisting.  They move slow enough that when sow ran out I didn't bother to leave and get it refreshed.  It is easy to get encumberd with all of the sythes so be picky about which ones you keep and which ones you destroy.<br />
<br />
I am level 40 and I did have C3 on but my gear is hardly uber.  My wis is about 170 and my MR unbuffed is about 45.  Some of the funnest hunting I haved in a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">curator</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok my rogue friend and I tried to hunt these specs but ran into a bit of a problem....We would get attacked by a SK and a Necro before we could even get to the specs.  Is 8b by eqatlas the correct spot?  If so how does one get to the specs?  If not, where does a stupid cleric find them? <br />
<br />
Hehe  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scaredHalfling</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several entrances to the catacombs you are entering thru the evil side try entering thru one of the other entrances.  I believe we entered through the pool to the Crow's nest.<br />
<br />
The spot is also not at 8b either. If you are looking at the eqatlas map then it is the spot just north of the zone in point on the map marked D.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Again Peace :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildiil</div><div class="date">02-10-2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading this post I had to go try it.  I could only handle 3 of them before the 1st respawns due to med time even with a KEI but with a partner you can clear all 4 easily as they spawn and this is simply amazing exp. I have a baby shaman and the 100% wt reduction spirit pouchs he can summon will hold 4 scythes each. I take 3 or 4 with me, along with a backpack for the light drops.  (runes, pages)<br />
USE PACIFY - cast on the closest 2, then you can single pull the one on the left with a dot.  If you try to pull the one on the right, one of the back two will come. After you kill the 1st, you need to invis to undead to sneak back to the back two to target them, then back up out of line of sight to cast pacify then repeat for the other one. You can then safely single pull the front right.  Repeat invis/pacify to pull #3, then send partner to get 4.  Once you have the spawn broken the meat shield can sit in the hall to grab agro as they spawn. Dont leave till the pouches are full.  I got 40+pp and 30% of the way to 44th in about 2 hours. Hoping to go back tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">curator</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would try this approach, especially if you have your 44 undead spells...pacify the first 2, then walk up and pacify the back 2, pull one of the first, fear it then blast.  Sit and med til it comes back, fear and blast, repeat until dead.  Continue until the spawn is broken then it is cake.  I went from 43 to 48 here in no time at all.  Loot is good, and it is never camped on my server.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildiil</div><div class="date">02-11-2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WHOA THERE<br />
There is a evil guild area for necros and  and i think evil clerics just behind the area these spawn. I am told that fear sends them running that way and they train back a 60th necro.  Obviously, I aint about to try it, hehe.   Fear does work very well on the ones in oasis though. There are seven in the tower there. Easy to pacify two high in the tower and all the corners and pull one corner getting two at a time (one in the tower I can't see to target adds). You do want to be sowed and if possible have levitate to pull them to shore. Fear one and root/nuke the other. If you are quick with first second will be lossing fear at just the right time. Root seems to hold on the ones in oasis must better than the oness in catacombs. <br />
<br />
In the catacombs, the front left can be single pulled with pacify on the front two only, which saves a little mana and tiime over having to invis twice and pacify the back two at the start.  The front right will bring a friend if you dont pacify the back two. <br />
<br />
I dinged 44 there last night and looking foward to going back with the new undead nuke in book. The second in the stun line lands almost every time and gives plenty of time for expel undead to be cast without interrupt will have to see if it works witht he new 44th level spell.<br />
<br />
I was partenering there part of the time with a 49 chanter (specs never saw what hit them. He was getting very good exp too. We had a lucky sting of Scythe drops (as opposed to bronze and rusties) and the vendors paid us over 100pp for 4 rounds of spawns (about an hour) I expect to be camping this spot for several levels to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">curator</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you pacify all the mobs then pull them one at a time to the wide area right in front and then use fear the specs will ALWAYS path away from the trainers.  I would pull, fear then undead nuke, then sit and med until fear broke (using our lowest level undead fear) and then I would nuke again as the spec rounded the corner.   This worked EVERY single time for me and I never had a spec go pull the trainers. BTW once you pacify the front two specs you dont have to invis to pacify the back two, just walk right by the first.  Make sure you do it fairly quickly though, since pacify only lasts 40ish seconds now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildiil</div><div class="date">02-12-2003, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am tired of getting the crap beat out of me when I do them solo( although defensive skillups have been coming quick down there ) So I'll give fear a try ASAP. I was going by what I read and will take the word of someone who has done it. :D<br />
<br />
I had noted that they walk away from trainers when they turn from low HP and wondered if they wouldn't follow that same path feared.  I was too chicken to try based on what I had read.  The exp and loot is so much better down there than anywhere else I have found to solo/duo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stumpy Jo</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had to try this as well, since my main, a wizard has been basically PLing me (albeit slowly).  I went down there with her (she's 56) and she rooted and snared them all and I cast Undead DD on them.  As soon as they were halfway she burned them down.  I think I'm going to stay here for awhile. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelenor</div><div class="date">02-14-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to go and try this out a couple weeks back but when i went to Qeynos to enter the Catacombs the zone in points were down :( <br />
<br />
Since from all these new posts it seems that Catacombs are up again and i just Dinged 44 last night looks like I'll be heading back to see if i can get some sweet solo action there. I am SO bored with dealing with Dreadlands Temper Tantrums hehe :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Crossing everything i can cross in hopes that this works as well for me as it seems to have worked for all of you :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelenor</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went back to Qey to try and enter the Catacombs and was most unhappy to find that entry points around the Bank in South Qey were not working. :( <br />
<br />
Since i had the time i tried the Tunnel under the second set of Docks and Presto ! im in Qeynos Catacombs  :p <br />
<br />
After a shakey start trying to work out the routine i finally got settled in. 1 day later im Dinging 45.<br />
<br />
The Exp on these is amazing at 44 -45. I'm taking 2/3 of a Blue for each Spectre. A couple guild mates dropped in to say hi and stayed for a couple hours and the exp was still wicked in a 3 man group. :D <br />
<br />
The loot while unpredictable is pretty good. Black Pearls, Scythes ranging from Rusty to Bronze to 12pp Scythes was earning me over 200pp for each KEI bought.<br />
<br />
One thing i noticed though is that when i first arrived there were 2 Sepsis Rats (live targets) at the front of the Hexagonal room before the Spectre H. These rats were LB at 44 and got assisted by one of the Spectres. One of these rats dropped a nice Resist Ring that i gave to a guildy. However , these rats have never respawned in all the time i have spent in that room.<br />
Just wanted to put that out there.<br />
<br />
With the Cleric L44 Undead spells and all the non symbol buffs up this is one SWEET hunting spot. my Wis is at 206 all in and 1 kill was 2 bubs of mana on average.<br />
Oh and Fear sends the Spectre running AWAY from the Trainer area on the far side of the H so Fearing is doable here. I dont , but you can if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sildiil</div><div class="date">02-24-2003, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fear Does work well. On the opener I have been pulling with fear so that if something goes wrong with pacify and you pull two at a time, the one you feared runs off and leaves only one to deal with. If pull goes well, spin and root. start nuking. three L44 undead nukes will kill one. When root breaks they run away and you can sit and med till he comes back. They come back into view and pause to cast and you can reroot then before they try to interrupt you.  I love this spot. Wish folks would stop sending tells for groups. I feel guilty If I dont go help the buds, but no group compares to soloing these right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saynac</div><div class="date">03-06-2003, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys. I am PLing up a newbie cleric and saw this post. Here are my stats: <br />
<br />
PLer - 52 High Elf Cleric with crappy gear and no AAs.<br />
PLee - 35 Gnome Cleric with crappier gear =)<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, I had KEI on both chars. Started off by Pacifying the front right spectre then pulled with Banish Undead from 52 cleric. Next, hit him once with Sound of Force. These two spells did a combined 49% damage to each spectre. Next, I just let the spectre beat on the 52 cleric while the 35 one cast his undead DD a couple times. Once the spectre started running away, one more cast would really kill him, sometimes I needed to toss a Force stun out there by the 35 cleric as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the big news here is that each kill, at level 35, gave 4% exp. It stayed that way until level 39 when each gave roughly 3.5% per kill. At 40, it seemed that they gave about 2-3% per kill.<br />
<br />
Great place to PL... rough place if you don't have a cleric to rez yourself, no one is ever in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baelenor</div><div class="date">03-07-2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, i dinged 49 a couple nights back and the exp on DBs is still around half a Blue per kill. Sadly more Light Blues are popping up now so my days of hunting here may be numbered.<br />
<br />
I took a mid 30s Paladin friend of mine in for a wee PL session yesterday and i found that for PLing a non Cleric the best route is to use standard killing tactics till the Spec is down to as low as you can get it without it dying then cast Atone. This wipes the clerics argo and leaves the Spec ripe for a few finishing hits from your PLee. In 2 seperate 4 hour sessions here my PLee has gained 1  level for each session and has walked with a couple hundred Plat in loot, half of which found its way into my purse :D <br />
<br />
On an information note, the entry under the Qeynos Docks on the Karana Server has also stopped working since the recent LoY  Install patch.  This line now takes you , rather bizarrely to Ak'Anon.<br />
However the tunnel from the North Qeynos Newbie area is still working as it should. I find myself wondering however, how long it will be before this line also stops working as it should :(</div></div><hr />
