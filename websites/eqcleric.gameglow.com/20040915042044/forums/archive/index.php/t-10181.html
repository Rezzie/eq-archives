I was in checking on Gynok and decided to pop down and viola.. I have a Pair of Gaunts now for sale for 3K plat or will trade for a pair of SBD's yes I know about the possible patch change etc etc but even then.. I feel there are many lev 50's that still have way too many things to do instead of sit in befallen bored to death as I have for many camps when I got my first pair. BTW its really cool to come back to this site after loosing the url for a while (Gizzy Bonks Gizzy on the head!) and read about my self in a few posts.. I am the Cleric that traded a pair of these things off for a Mithral BP  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif)) therefore yes I know how grueling this camp can be. I took vacation from work for my prevoius 2 camps to get these. Anyways.. I am rambling, Hello all and if you have a lot of plat lying around or a pair of SBD's on Prexus gimme a yell as Gizzy or as Mcgizz (my rogue) Goodluck all ! <br />
