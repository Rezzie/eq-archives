<br />
My party and I were searching the Frontier Forest for a rumored dungeon and thought we had found it, but instead zoned into the Burning Wood.<br />
<br />
Mobs were high level Sarnaks (champion), Tatterback and Tottering Apes (undead, though they don't look it), plaguebringer skeleton, Wurm (cool, looks like a little dragon, though we didn't fight it. And a red wasp of some sort.<br />
<br />
Everything was blue at 45. Note that mobs seemed to have a strong tendency to attack the weakest member of the party.<br />
