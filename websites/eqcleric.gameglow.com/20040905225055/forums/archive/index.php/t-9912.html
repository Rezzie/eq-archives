<br />
I got SoV. I do like the place, if for no other reason than it hits me in the part of my brain that contains my wanderlust. However, I have lost more xp there in the last couple of days than I have gained.<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 41. Penalty level. Dying is just...ouch. Well last night I died. Tonight I died. It's just unavoidable. I rezzed myself last night, saved half of what I lost. Tonight, Cinen from Evoluxa rezzed me and saved nearly all of what I lost (cheers to Cinen as well as Kraegar who asked him to rez me).<br />
<br />
After that, I just logged. I was just too incredibly, royally pissed (even after the good deed of Cinen rezzing me at Kraegar's request). Why? It's how I died.<br />
<br />
I'd been looking for a group. Took me not terribly long but I did find a group. Met one person from the group at the entrance to the Wurm tunnels. She is sowed, I am not. So she is leading me in, we get just to the first branch, when up the tunnel comes a wurm. We dive for the branch. We watch.<br />
<br />
We would've been fine...except for the second Wurm (lol..of course). The second wurm turned into the branch and immediately set upon the person who was leading me and myself. I died. To my knowledge, she did not (at least she did not pop up in Thurgadin, she never left the Great Divide).<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
So I sit down. She sends me a tell asking if I'd died. I said yeah. I start memming my spells, figuring the rest of her group is fighting that wurm or they are getting organized, surely she is going to ask me about bringing my body out of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
But she doesn't. I spent the time talking to some friends, mostly venting over really stupid deaths. Fifteen minutes go by and Kraegar wandered by and offered to fetch my body and pull it to the waterfall for me.<br />
<br />
To be honest, if I'd invited someone to my group and they died on the way, *while with me*, I take it as my responsibility to help them get their body. It's the same as if this person is in your group.<br />
<br />
After I'd been rezzed, I saw an /ooc from this person looking for more people for their group - tanks or casters. Seems that right after I died, she found another healer (I *do* hope that one had better luck than I did). Call my cynical, but I have to wonder how much that contributed to a complete failure to offer me any help getting my body.<br />
