<br />
THE GREY GETS NERFED<br />
<br />
The Grey zone in Luclin was patched live a short while ago.<br />
Many mobs in there have had their resists significantly increased. Players are also reporting an increase in hitpoints on many monsters, and the addition of a new mob which is immune to Magic based spells. This can only have been done in response to the large numbers of AE groups which had been set up in the zone for fast exp gain.<br />
<br />
So casters beware next time you hit the zone. <br />

Good old nerf stick - gotta love it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemean</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres an update on eq casters - apparently its being tweaked again, so that rooting/snaring is more possible now, but insane AoE groups is no longer possible.  If they've done it right, then good  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />
