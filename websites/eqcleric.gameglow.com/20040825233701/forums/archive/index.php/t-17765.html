We are accepting applications from all classes of all races. To see our current application requirements visit us at www.infiniteinsanity.com and click on the join area to bring up the applicant forums with these requirements. Even if you don't meet those requirements, but are 55+ still post anyways and we will evaluate those apps on a case by case basis. We raid approx. 5 days a week with various targets depending on what is up.<br />
<br />
For loot distribution, we use a DKP &quot;dragon kill points&quot; system to make sure loot is distributed in a fair manner for the guild and not to the same people. Applicants earn full points from day 1, but are unable to spend these points till they become a member.<br />
<br />
