Just head to Oasis (out of peak time if possible) and pull spectres. Fear all but one, root and banish 3 times. med out of range.<br />
Rinse and repeat. Awesome and easy exp, good money, short level.</div></div><hr />

Can't play in non-peak hours. I've tried soloing, I can't / don't work that way, I need the social interaction of the group. Random groups in old EQ like to play &quot;Kill the Cleric&quot;, random groups in Kunark like to play &quot;Kill the Cleric as fast as possible.&quot; The first 2 bubbles have now taken me a week and a half.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">06-06-2000, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">45 is the one level where you're better off soloing than grouping.  Something screwy about the way exp is calculated in a group when you're 45...<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to try one of the following:<br />
<br />
Old lands:  Feerrott swamp, spectre by the tree.  At 45, I was able to keep up with the spawn, stay at full mana, sometimes snag someone else's snafu as they fled the fear portal area.<br />
<br />
Kunark:  Dreadlands.  Base off the plaza surrounding karnor's castle.  I found the southeast corner to be best, but use whatever works for you.  Have to be careful of the kiting druids, but otherwise usually quite safe.  DON'T use sow -- you outrun them and they go home.  Find stonegazer chickens, gnashers, any of the spiders.  Open with retribution, run back to the plaza, root, retribution or stun until dead.  Just watch your path so you don't attract two instead of just one.<br />
<br />
Kunark:  Dreadlands.  To your right as you exit the FV tunnel, is an undead ruins.  Use the standard Banish / Root / Banish technique... just be careful, there is one named different from the rest, rare spawn (forget the name...) -- he is a lot tougher than he looks and will wipe the floor with you.  The only thing to watch with these spawns is that you need to stay out of melee, it's tough to get spells off when they are quad attacking (darn monks!)  You can generally  med safely on the hill just southeast of the ruins -- plus the zone is close if something does aggro on you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps -- once 45 is behind you, it's clear sailing to 51 (and then the hell levels return)  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Sure, it's slow, but I hated 35 the most, with 30 coming in a close second.<br />
<br />
Places I hunted in at 45: Kedge Keep (get down to the second floor), seafuries in OOT, Dreadlands, Burning Woods.  Try to avoid grouping with anyone much higher than you (especially 51+, it makes a BIG difference to xp) unless you're killing stuff much higher level than you.<br />
<br />
Made it through 45 in just over a week, and that wasn't particularly heavy playing, either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos Inglorion</div><div class="date">06-08-2000, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, good post, and good suggestions.  I am 45 now also and finding during virtually all hours I try to play that the trolls in the rathe mountains and the spectres in the feerrott are camped by soloists or lower level groups who (apparently) do not want me hogging the experience.  <br />
Pacifying the oasis spectres might be safer for the other players than fearing them, but how to even reach the spectres without swimming the moat?  I may save the oasis spectres for level 47, when I can stand up there on that island.  <br />
The dreadlands suggestion is starting to look good to me.  There is very little to solo in the old world for a 45 cleric, and plenty of people to be there first.  I've tried hunting near Karnor's Castle with a druid friend, and it worked out pretty well.  Going solo there without SoW troubles me, even with the zone reasonably close. <br />
I tried hunting the burning woods with the elite of my guild who are 51+, and earned perhaps 1% experience for every ten giants/wurms/moldering apes killed.  They seemed to be doing better than I experience-wise even in ultra-hell-level 51, so grouping does not seem to be a sensible way to go. <br />
All I need is a week alone with troll guard Shiznak in the Rathe Mountains (nice safe single spawn point).  Maybe Shiznak will be more accessible after Diablo II opens at the end of the month and siphons off a lot of people.<br />
Also, most people don't seem to know that there is an extensive fortress stocked with undead (and other critters) in the southwest corner of the Kunark wizard/druid gate-in area.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise just try pacify<br />
