I have been in Kunark for awhile and need to go back and stock up on Bloodtones for Symbol of Ryltan. Are Bloodstones and the other compnents available only in Freeport and Qeynos?</div></div><hr />

The female sells precious metals and a few gems. The male sells the other gems, including symbol components and pearls.<br />

I buy all of my components that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just an interesting note:<br />
<br />
If your charisma is 115 or higher, you will get the best prices regardless of faction.<br />
<br />
(For instance, my cleric has a 75 base charisma, and her price for peridots in FV is about 13pp or so.  My bard's cha is 126, and she always gets 10p5g.  If I buff my cleric's cha to 115+, I get the same price, even tho my faction is only indiff, while my bard is amiable.)<br />

Tend to be easy spots to hit at the end of the night.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olanthe Imaandar</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of tips for buying peridots in Firiona. First, most people I know started off apprehensive there. But fixing faction is surprisingly easy. Killing the goblins in the Lake of Ill Omen will give positive faction hits. (Not the bloodgills, but the lower level &quot;a goblin scout&quot; and &quot;a goblin warlord&quot; types.) <br />
<br />
You can hunt these for experience if a low enough level, but they are very green to me (and we all know how efficiently clerics can mow through greens... LOL). So I cheated a bit. I went to the goblin mines in the NW corner of the zone and found a level 20-27 group camping there. I made a deal with them - offered to buff them, keep them out of trouble, and res any of them who died, if I could get one stun in per goblin. They were only too happy to oblige. So I spent a lazy evening helping them out and having a conversation in tells with their cleric, who had all sorts of questions about our class, and getting faction for everything they killed. Prior to this, my price for peridots in Firiona was 12.1 pp even with my best charisma gear on. After three hours at the camp, I had gone from apprehensive to indifferent, and my price had dropped to 10.8 pp.<br />
<br />
My charisma stinks too (base 70), but I carry a few items that can get it up to 97. It's still not enough to get the lowest prices anywhere but in my hometown of Erudin. So if I'm hunting somewhere with an enchanter or shaman, I ask them for a charisma buff right before the group breaks up for the night. I then go immediately to town, sell any cash items I picked up, and restock my gem supply. With my items and the buff, I always get the lowest prices.<br />
<br />
Just a couple of suggestions, hope it helps  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
