Its always been a beef of mine that Fear is such a dull and useless place for Clerics.  Everyone has a hard time getting clerics to go because of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And btw, the 15 sec indifferent thing has made a fear break easy, lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">03-14-2001, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always liked fear because of this.  You could stop worrying about loot and get down to taking down the mobs as quickly and efficiently as possible.<br />
<br />
And of course theres always the temple pull at the end, which lets ya run around like a mad man :&gt;<br />
<br />
That 15 seconds indifferent thing means ya now no longer have to zone into pog with invis on :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasren</div><div class="date">03-14-2001, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my boots in fear about a month ago. It is a very rare drop off the cubes or at least they were before this patch.<br />
<br />
The belt and the boots were the only 2 possible cleric drops in fear.<br />
<br />
Fear is an enjoyable zone if you like the open space feeling but the xp is lousy unless you get put in pull or tank1 group. Being in a caster group just doesn't give quite the xp it used to before they increased the taunt values for warriors.<br />
<br />
I also used it as a way to meet people and eventually be added for hate raids.<br />

Take a look around, I'm sure you'll see some new cleric gear information flowing in.<br />

<br />
Any pics of a cleric wearing it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">03-21-2001, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT skunked us.  We had a pretty big raid going but he really owned us badly.  Lot of link death problems.  Any tips?<br />
<br />
P.S. Got boots off a jello.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khalim - Innoruuk</div><div class="date">03-21-2001, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT is now a &quot;velious encounter&quot; insane HP, 10 minute fights, the whole nine yards.  Real key, not to start one of those &quot;casters are useless&quot; rants, is melee, and lots of it.  I could post numbers from velious encounters, with damage output of the various classes vs a mob with ~200k hp, but you all know how it works.<br />
<br />
  CT is definitely fun, took us 3 attempts to figure out his trick.  He's not unkillable, but like most big mobs, you just have to find out what works, and what doesn't.<br />
<br />
  Avatar snare definitely isn't fun..<br />

P.S. As far as loot for clerics, has there ever been any besides our standard outfits? =) Nothing surprising there, a couple neat new toys here and there.</div></div><hr />
