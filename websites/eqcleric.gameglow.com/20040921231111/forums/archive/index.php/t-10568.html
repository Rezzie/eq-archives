I headed over to EF to mammoth hunt, but I've gotta think there's somewhere else where I can get some minimal xp (or good xp) and good loot at a little quicker pace??</div></div><hr />

Once you get another level or two under your belt, you might try the snow cougars near the igloos in Iceclad Ocean if you have Velious.  They hit really hard, but if you partner with a good tank that will keep them off of you, you should be able to do pretty well there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calahad</div><div class="date">06-01-2001, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, made 80pp on the great Mammoth Hunt, and made it back to Kunark after some fun on the boat (and in the ocean, hehe).  I've got a friend w/ me that's level 21, so I think I will hang around LOIO for a little while so he can at least get to 24 or so.  I'm thinking that a nice side trip for me one day would be to head over to Kurn's Tower and try to get the Berserker Club and some of the lesser WIS items.  Any thoughts on that plan?  Thanks for first reply, will definitely give that a whirl once I get another couple lvls =)</div></div><hr />
