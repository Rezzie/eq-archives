<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">03-09-2001, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been my obeservation that the single most common cause of failure on big raids is the linkdeath of a high percentage of the participants and/or key classes like clerics.<br />
<br />
In your EQ directory there is a file named &quot;DataRate.txt&quot;, open this file in notpad or another text editor. There is a number in it, the default is 5.0, this is the allowable data packet size, in kilobits, your client will accept from the EQ server. Its the number on the right of the lag-o-meter on your screen in game.<br />
<br />
If the number on the right goes over the number in your DataRate.txt file x1000k (5.0 in the file = 5000 on the lag meeter), you will probably be disconnected.<br />
<br />
The solution to this problem is to increase the number in the DataRate.txt file. The setting you should try is dependent on what type of connection you have. <br />
<br />
For those with dialup connections members of my guild have found 7.0 to work best, drop it to 6.0 if your connection becomes unstable.<br />
<br />
For those with adsl and other &quot;broadband&quot; connections under 500kbs a setting of 8.0 to 9.0 work fine, but I have had people tell me that they had connection problems at 9.0  *shrug*.<br />
<br />
For those with adsl/cable/t1/etc.. over 500kbs a setting of 9.0 doesn't seem to ever cause a problem.<br />
<br />
I have seen reports of people setting it as high as 40.0, but Verant doesn't recommend a setting higher than 9.0. I have know idea why 9.0 is the highest recommended by Verant...<br />
<br />
This simple little change to the DataRate.txt file can be, and often is, the difference between one group of people failing miserably due to mass linkdeath where a similar group has little problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ethel Etana</div><div class="date">03-09-2001, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to add that while I was unaware of some of the particulars of the datarate.txt setting, I was definately aware of it's effect.<br />
<br />
    The other night in Plane of Growth we had this one particular guild druid who kept going LD literally anytime a fight would happen--and we only had 12 or so folks up there at the time.  Knowing that he was on a University Ethernet connection really just confused things, as I've found the folks on those type connections are usually among the most stable. <br />
<br />
     I spoke to him a bit and found out it had been happening a lot of any Velious raid he was involved in, and he had no idea what the problem might be--he even bought more RAM for his system hoping that that would fix it, which unfortunately it didn't.<br />
<br />
     Needless to say, I'd heard of folks seeing very nice performance improvements from modifying the datarate file, so I suggested he bump it up to 7 or 8 or so.  He made the changes and all of his problems simply vanished.<br />
<br />
     I would definately second Calael's advice--if you've got LD problems on the larger raids, suggest the folks on cable or better fix their datarate file.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

PS- Trolling the message boards drunk, fyi.  I had a &quot;sober&quot; friend proofread this, so hopefully it's OK.  If not, my apologies in advance.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">03-13-2001, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Upping the datarate on modem from 5 to 7 helps with the lag issue (whereby you dont disconnect but for every say 10 seconds of a fight you become lagged by 1 second so after a minute every action is lagged by 6 seconds).<br />
<br />
It does however increase packetloss due to the fact that the modem can not handle the connection and drops packets.  Packetloss is the more acceptable loss although it does make checking that your spells get cast very important.<br />
<br />
If verant would just provide a server side filter we wouldn't have to worry about this.<br />
<br />
40 people pre velious/kunark didn't lag.  More than 24 post velious do.</div></div><hr />
