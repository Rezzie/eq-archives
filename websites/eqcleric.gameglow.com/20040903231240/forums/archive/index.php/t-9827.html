<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimette</div><div class="date">03-27-2000, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 43 (44 now!) I had just started working my way through Sol B, and I've been the main healer in the Window room to get a feel for how nasty the creatures are.<br />
<br />
I refuse to be driven anonymous, and I survive mainly by having a set of pre-rehearsed replies (one of them on a hotkey - /r I am sorry, but I cannot leave my group at this moment others are depending on me) <br />
<br />
Sol A was winning against people last night, and I had fended off at least 5 people walking into the room or sending me a tell saying 'Can you res me in the Rug Room' just after XP, rather then the get-back-to-the body need. I was never about 50% mana, and we had had the Priest, two Solusk Kobalds and the King dropped on us in three seperate trains, each time by people using us to get rid of the trash so they could kill the named. No, we didn't get a chance to roll on any of it.<br />
<br />
So, #6 started sending me tells, and I punched generic reply to his first two comments. Then I got a message from him that made me so angry I cannot remember all of it, but it was one solid paragraph and started with :<br />
<br />
'I'm SO sorry to have interrupted your game. Far be it from me to ask you to HELP another player. Feel free to continue looking out for number one, and I hope that you don't need my help for anything in the future'<br />
<br />
At this stage, I'm very glad that nothing majorly bad was happening in the room - he got about three long /tells from me informing him just what I thought about him and his attitude. Turned out that he was in LFaydark, and if he had mentioned that he may have gotten a very quick Revive. He had no-chance at all after that comment.<br />
<br />
At the same time, a friend of his was /shouting 'Can anyone res my friend [Name deleted, 30th level Paladin]- he's died in Sol A and is a really nice guy.'<br />
<br />
I made sure to /shout out the fact that this was not apparant based on the /tells that I was getting, and that he thought that I never helped anyone else. Thankfully there were some people there who gave me some /tells to calm me down, otherwise I would have been useless for the next half hour.<br />
<br />
How can you explain to these people that adding in zoning time and downtime for those of us on 56k Modems, it means we are out of the group for 2 minutes, and lose 3 minutes worth of mana ? Yet they seem to insist that it's just some minor thing, and we are big demons for not doing it.<br />
<br />
As an aside, one of the people who had hasstled me for a zone-and-xp res asked to join, and as leader I invited them. I took greate pleasure in announcing my mana for the duration of his stay - '20%, good for 1' '40% good for 2' '50% - Buff check'. to hammer home the point that I wasn't sitting on 5 bubbles reading a book.<br />
<br />
Bright spots - No deaths, but the 2 Solusks that trained on us managed to take our main tank down to no HP showing before the OOM-medding-greater hit. And I made 44th, then had to sit there for 2 more hours throwing Valour because I hadn't expected to make it that quickly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">03-27-2000, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been fighting with this now since I got 39 (I'm now 48) and am really dreading turning 49, because it will get worse.  I've tried a billion different methods.  My common response now is:<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry, I am committed to my group right now and can not rez you&quot;.<br />
<br />
This *should* explain to them that a) I'm not sitting on my butt, b) that I'm needed elsewhere and c) that my mana is very needed.<br />
<br />
Most the people get the hint, and say &quot;Okay, thanks&quot;.  But for the ones who have to send me a reply about how they really need that rez.. my comeback and satisfaction is as follows.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry, but I am committed to my group, and can not leave at this time.  If you wish to further harass me I will gladly report you to your guild (if they have one) and put you on my &quot;DO NOT REZ EVER AGAIN&quot; list, and that list includes if you ever die with me in the Planes.  And if I'm feeling really happy, I'll make sure to list your name on the Cleric's Board so that no one else will rez you either.  If you wanted Rezzes on Demand, you should have created a cleric or had a high level cleric in your group&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now at this point, they are going to make 1 of two choices.  They're going to go sulk off to the corner and shut up or they are going to get flippy with you.  If they get flippy, follow through with what you said.  I've only had to report 1 person to their guild (he called me a b**** for not rezzing, and said he wasn't scared of my threats), and after I informed the guild officer I was sent an apology by the cleric abuser and have not delt with him since.  If you don't get an apology, put him/her on that do not rez list (mine is /ignore).  And if they are extremely nasty, list them here.<br />
<br />
I play EQ a lot.  My boyfriend and I are both highly addicted, and hey, we're happy with our lives... so I get a lot of rez requests.  And I simply refuse to be put into situations where the game no longer is fun.. and nasty people who want a rez make the game no fun.  I don't belong to a guild, so the only person I *OWE* a rez to are those in my group, and I don't care if you have fought with me a billion times.. if you're not in my group, I am not going to rez you.  What people don't understand is this...<br />
<br />
When a cleric is in a group, it is not just a cleric, it is 6 people fighting together.  That rez effects all 6 people, and the cleric simply has not right to put 5 other people on hold so that 1 person who isn't in that group can get a rez.  It's common courtsey, plain and simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reorx</div><div class="date">03-27-2000, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too like to remain unanonymous at all times so friends can tell where I am and to show my level as sorts (I'm bloody proud of that 50 beside my name).  Whether I help or not depends on what I'm doing and how the person asks.  If I'm too busy to help I'll explain it to them.  I've had some people beg for a bit but most people are understanding. <br />
<br />
I also get some people who are quite rude when asking and I usually decline to help them.  I mean, you're asking someone to spend 700mana, their time to get to you and back, and the time to med back up.  The least you could do is ask politely.  When I ask someone for a teleport clarity, etc..., I try to be as polite as I can and offer some sort of compensation (ie: plat, cleric buffs, ...).  Trust me, you'll get much more positive answers asking like this.<br />

<br />
I just turned 36. I have been rezzed *maybe* 3 times in my life. All by a high level friend who, at the time, was fighting in my group with his secondary. So he logs in his Cleric. Boom. Instant rez.<br />
<br />
The first time I ever asked for a Rez, was on Saturday when MM went bad.<br />
/shout If any clerics out there have a second, a fellow brother could sure use a rez.<br />
.......no response.......<br />
hmmm. Ok. No biggie. <br />
Loot up, and go play.<br />
<br />
Who are all these a-holes that feel **entitled**??<br />
Nothing irks me more than when I get a tell to do a rez (revive) for a lowbie.<br />
And Im not talking about &quot;can you revive me because I forgot I binded in Halas&quot;<br />
No, the greedy little bastads want as much exp as they can get back.<br />
I dont blame em, I did (and do too). <br />
But I am waiting....WAITING for the day that someone tees off on me for being inconsiderate.<br />
<br />
/em rant off.<br />

You mentioned a blacklist of folks who will not be revived.<br />
<br />
I know that one of the Druid sites actually keeps a public list, with the reasons why folks made it onto the list.<br />
<br />
I know that I share names with my guilds, and with my local gaming group, when it is appropriate.  Should we start another forum or thread with names, servers, and reasons?<br />

<br />
If they cannot do that I am not gonna go wandering off to rez them and leave my group without a healer. <br />
<br />
Normally when I hit FM if there are no mobs around I rez them. If they bother me once in the between time I let them know I will as soon as I have the mana and I haven't forgotten about them. If they bother me twice I politely let them know that I haven't forgotten about them but continuing to remind me may cause me to forget.... I have never had anyone continue to remind me ;0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">03-27-2000, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today I log into Sol B (yes I still live there) and shout &quot;Level 48 cleric looking for a group&quot;.<br />
<br />
I get a tell from a friend to join them at Nox and as I'm getting that tell a little person runs up to me and shouts to me REZ ME!<br />
<br />
I simply say &quot;No, I'm sorry, I can't.&quot;<br />
<br />
I run to my new group, get into the group (all tanks) everyone is literally 1/4 health and I get a tell from the &quot;REZ ME GUY&quot;.  &quot;Thanks a lot b****, I'll remember you in the future&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes I'm serious.  I have stopped counting how many times that B word has been uttered to me because I said no to a rez.<br />
<br />
So to answer the question of should there be a forum of a black list.  Yes, I honestly do.  I'm seeing a lot of level 50 characters playing their second character and *expecting* you to rez them.  They've gotten so darn used to getting their 50 rezzed, why can't they get their level 20 rezzed as well.  And if you don't do it, they simply can't understand why.<br />
<br />
I want to play the game and have fun.  Not put up with the abuse of little twirps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cathawk</div><div class="date">03-29-2000, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've been in Anon Roleplay mode my entire Cleric career, so the /tells aren't all that many.<br />
<br />
My friends or guild members will always give me /tells, and providing I can reach them and I'm not deeply involved in something, I'll travel across the entire world to res them.<br />
<br />
Some people can figure out you're a cleric. They know you're reputation or the Shiney Gold Armor gives it away. If they're in the same zone and a res will not cripple me, then I'll be happy to help. Other's I've scared away because they thought it was my duty to go to another zone and res them!??! Those players trip me out... they must have never read a fantasy novel in their life. Heck, playing a dwarf, I should charge all non-dwarves a price for a res. That would be truly role playing my character!<br />
<br />
How much trouble are we going to receive now with /tells because the res bug is fixed?<br />
<br />
On a side note, I usually try and res if i'm able. People want to pay me and I deny it. I tell them to just remember me. It'll build my reputation and I'd like to have an excellent rep when it's time for me to enter the planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabbus</div><div class="date">03-29-2000, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My opinion on this is a two way street.  I can understand how the person asking for the rez feels too.<br />
<br />
I (a level 35 cleric) have asked for a exp rez, and NOT ONCE has another cleric ever given me one.   <br />
<br />
But I can also understand you being in a group.  Usually if someone asks me for a rez (mine doesn't give exp yet), I will either do it right away, or will tell them I am busy at the moment, and I might be able to later.<br />
<br />
But then again, I don't join groups much.  If I happen to be, I try to find time to do it, mainly because I know what its like for no one to offer to do it.<br />
<br />
Your only real choice to avoid it is to be anonymous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaton</div><div class="date">03-30-2000, 12:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now why should I go anon and have to hide from all these stupid people?  I have as much right to be unanon as much as anyone else and I see it as a pathetic way to hide.<br />
<br />
Just the other day I was fighting in Cazic on the temple and had someone ask to rez thier group member.  He was over at the silver temple and I told him to bring the body to me and I will do it.  Well the dead guy didn't trust the group mate to drag his body so the guy asked if I would go to the silver temple.  I asked the group if it was ok and they said no.  I was the only healer and they needed me incase the named should spawn.  So I told the guy that I couldn't leave my group and that I am thier only healer if the other guy won't let you drag it to me then I'm sorry I can't do it.  My group comes first.  The guy understood and left it at that.  He didn't ask again.  Unless it gets worse the higher I get I'm not going to hide behind the anon tag.  <br />
<br />
I find the only time I have to go anon is when for whatever reason I have to go through oasis.  This is the only time I ever go anon only because if they catch wind that a higher lvl cleric is in the zone they will pester me to powerlvl them for nothing.  But the mojority of the time I am unanon for I find it is much easier to get a group that way.  I always get tells asking if I'm in a group or not.<br />
<br />
From reading post on this board about the rez blues it does make me feel that people see us as thier own personal babysitters and we owe them all our services because we are clerics and are supose to drop everything and help people out.  Well how about this:  next time someone demands something of us check thier class then demand something from them ie:  if its a warrior demand that they powerlvl you by taunting.  if a ranger demand that they track something for you.  if a...well you get the point.  Lets see how the other classes like all the pestering that we have to go through.  (I know these ideas won't fly but it is a funny thought.)<br />

There is nothing wrong with saying No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">03-30-2000, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeap it is me again.<br />
<br />
1.  Going Anon. - <br />
<br />
Part One<br />
<br />
Night before last a friend needed a cleric in lower guk.  I hate guk, but I went, as it was my mostest favorite enchanter friend.  I get there and he tells me to go anon because I guess guk is worse for rez requests.  I go anon.  5 minutes later I get a tell from one guy who plays in Sol B.  Can you rez me he asks.  No, I'm sorry, I can't... I'm in Lower Guk.  I get 4 more requests in the next 5 minutes from people in Sol B.  I was anon, in a different zone far away.. anon didn't help.<br />
<br />
Part Two<br />
<br />
Zone into ANY zone.. and if you're looking for a group.  What is the first thing you shout?  Level # cleric looking for a group.  Well there goes my cover.  If I say Cleric looking for a group, I don't get a response.. they want to know your level.  So I'm forced to say Level # cleric.  Trust me, people remember those shouts... they remember who is a cleric and who isn't.. and what level you were the last time you shouted for a group.  And if that level is above 39, they will never forget you.<br />
<br />
2.  No response from a cleric when you ask them for a rez. - I can fully understand why a majority of clerics do not answer.  Have you ever sat with a young child who is going through their &quot;Why&quot; stage.  You know the one, where they want to know why for everything.  Almost every parent has a point where they can handle only so many why's and they stop answering the why's.  Well, I'm the parent who has grown weary of the why question.  My children are the EQ players who feel it is my duty to rez them.  Saying &quot;No sorry&quot; is not sufficient.  They must ask why, and they must beg and plead and beg some more, and some even have to harrasse you and call you nasty names.  Not everyone is polite, and not everyone understands what &quot;No&quot; means.  And there is a reason why I don't have children of my own, and why my neices and nephews are 1,000 miles away.  If I wanted children, I'd have a couple of my own... I don't need to play a game and have 1500 of them decided that I'm the focus of their why questions.<br />
<br />
Yes, I fully understand that getting your experience back is a benefit.  But then I have to ask, if they are playing in the same zone as me, why don't they have their own cleric to rez them?  We are the only class in the game (currently) that can give back to players experience (besides gm's).  Getting back experience is NOT a requirement.. it's a privledge.  You want the privledge, get your own darn cleric.. because this one is currently devoted to the group that asked her to join.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never charged for a res(unless it was an enchanter in which case the fee was a clarity if there was not one in the group)nor accepted any pp that has been offered and will res if it does not endanger the group and usually the persons corpse will have to be brought to where i am.<br />
<br />
As to asking others,i have only ever asked 3 times (outside of the group).<br />
<br />
1) Werewolf hunters jumped me before i could bind near Regis,was still bound in Nek Forest(revive would have suited me),the person said they where busy so i traded a valor for a sow and started running.<br />
<br />
2) Due to a lag spike a group member died,so i asked a cleric that i personally knew(they where in that zone) if they where able to do a res.<br />
<br />
3) LDC spawned in Pool room,a tank paniced and i died (was only one) on way to zone.Regeared and carried on until i had to log anyway and then ooced for a res.<br />
<br />
<br />
Addendum: I am very grateful to thoose Clerics that have on occasion /t Do you want a res? (I always CR and res the rest of the group before doing my own)<br />

So goes the way of the high level Cleric in this game.I am a 50th lvl Cleric playing on Brell server, belong to a guild that requires us never to be anonymous. Do to this it is not unusual to receive tells for ress 20-30 times a day from all over the land.<br />
<br />
You have mentioned the time that a cleric loses to perform such a request. Let me also remind others of the experience that you lose.If you have left your group (exp gain)you may in fact be losing the same amount of exp you choose to replace for the other character.<br />
<br />
I make it a point to ress my guildmates, freinds whenever possible. I will ress all others upon request that are close or even travel if I am not grouped. I do not charge for resses and do this just because I like to help people whenever I can.<br />
<br />
When not possible to do a ress, because of being grouped, I usually reply by saying Sorry I am grouped and it would be to risky for me to do this at this time. If you can drag your corps to me Ill galdly do inbetween battles.If not loot your corps and leave something on it I will try to help within the 2 hr period.<br />
<br />
My second alternative response is Sorry I cant do maybe another time. I am deep in a difficult zone will be impossible for me to ress you. Maybe another high lvl Cleric can do for you.<br />
<br />
I have yet to make an enemy or have a harsh word said to me, for not being able to ress someone, when a kindly respose is given.<br />
Some will try to bribe you with PP. But if you tell them PP isn't an issue they should understand<br />
<br />
Hopefully this will help on those future tells.<br />

<br />
I liked the time that I was running from Sol B to Lguk....I was just entering the Tunnel to zone into Nro.<br />
<br />
I get a tell asking for a res...Hmmm...where?  In WC?  Hmm...no SoW...And its pretty light in EC no one has been taking me up on my offer, Resolution for a SoW...So many folks don't know this spell...<br />
<br />
SO while I run over...cause I haven't said that I WILL res this person..I'm auctioning for a SoW...and they send me a tell...I'll pay you 200pp....<br />
<br />
Hey...thats pretty nice...but I rarely take money for a res.  I still dont say anything, as I think it would be nice if I just showed up...did it an then refused the cash....I've done that alot..and it generally leaves them in awe that someone would be that altruistic.<br />
<br />
SO I see this magicians corpse..and she is there...OK..its just for Exp...not a problem...I sit....and res 49th lvl....Woo Hoo...<br />
<br />
Just as it was done...she turns to me and says...I don't have any money...you'll have to wait until I can get to the bank...<br />
<br />
That person went on my never Res list..its not the cash...I think it has to do with me going to buy or pay for a service from someone else...I never offer that which I can't pay for up front...<br />
<br />
Sorta like me going into a restaurant and sitting down to eat..and knowing I don't have the cash to pay for it...but the waiter assumes that I do..<br />
<br />

<br />
I was ready to log the other night when I get a tell from a fellow cleric asking for a rez.  Her group evaced while she had DA on and she ended up dying.  She also forgot to bind, so she was half way across the world.  I stayed awake long enough to go over 2 zones and give her a rez.<br />
<br />
The very next day while hunting spectres, I get trained and die.  (Bad enough taking on 2 solo, but 3?  Hmmm)  Who do I find the next zone over?  The same cleric I had rezed the night before!  She gladly runs over and rezes me.  (I, too, like an idiot, was bound by Kedge)<br />
<br />
On the flip side, while looking for a partner to hunt Seafuries with, I was unsuccessful in finding a partner or group.  In the process of looking, I had a level 45 necro tell me that no one wanted a level 48 cleric, and to have me give him a tell when I made level 49.<br />
<br />
2 days later I get a tell from the same necro asking for a rez.  I'll let you imagine what I told him  (laughs)<br />

I was in freeport getting a friend to enchant some plat bars for one of the quests, and i get a random tell from someone i don't know;<br />
<br />
Stranger tells you &quot;Can you come do a res for a friend of mine?&quot;<br />
You tell stranger,&quot;Where did they die?&quot;<br />
Stranger tells you,&quot;Oasis&quot;<br />
You tell stranger,&quot;I'm not headed that way, but for 100plat, i'll make a trip&quot;<br />
Stranger tells you,&quot;Thats ridiculous, I never charge anyone for ports&quot;<br />
/who Stranger<br />
[Anonymous] Stranger<br />
You tell Stranger,&quot;Why are you anon?&quot;<br />
Stranger tells you,&quot;I'm not, i only turn that one when i'm on a raid with my guild&quot;<br />
/who Stranger<br />
[41 Wizard] Stranger Oasis<br />
You tell Stranger,&quot;Guild event in oasis?&quot;<br />
<br />
So then it gets funny, and the friend of the stranger, who actually needed the res gets involved.<br />
<br />
Friend tells you,&quot;100plat for a res? is that right?&quot;<br />
You tell Friend,&quot;Considering its 3 zones out of my way, yes&quot;<br />
You tell Friend,&quot;You don't think my travelling 3 zones out of my way to give you back free exp is worth 100plat?&quot;<br />
Friend tells you,&quot;No, i can get the exp back for free killing things&quot;<br />
You tell Friend,&quot;Then why did you ask me for a res?&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the kind of crap I have to deal with, on an almost daily basis.  I'm going to log in today and do what one of my friends suggested.<br />
/r I'm sorry, I'm AFK (Away from Keyboard)<br />
Just mimic the autoresponse from /afk, and let them deal with it.<br />

Actually, I kinda like the ability to pick up all of the good karma with people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faithfull</div><div class="date">04-11-2000, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a full level 50 cleric, on Tarew Marr. I have come into sol b, and done res's for an hour before I even get into a group. Usually, I am the zone res bitch. Everyone comes to get a res from me. I think I have a lot more mana then all of you, a full 49 res takes a little more then a bar to cast, which is not all that much. I tell everyone to bring thier body to me and I res it. Easy enough. I can't remeber the last time I went a half hour without doing atleast one res, even while 4 of us were camping the King room in lower guk. Still mana to res people. Most I ever done? 49 res's back to back on a failed hate raid, that I had to die 3 times myself to do. Gotta love getting to SWC in a full spawn. <br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
I have never been without a group, never without getting a port, invis, shrink for a friend, anything. I shout I get, simple. Been invited to camps where they turn everyone down, been given much reputation.<br />
<br />
Resing is a privalage, I do not go out of zone that often, but I do res my friends, regardless, and thier friends all the time. I would rather be well loved then thought of an asshole. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't res anyone and everyone. People get a res appropriate level, and I do turn down doing res's if I truly can't afford it, which is rare. There are also maybe 75 high level people I absoluetly will not res, couple guilds I can;t stand. But ppl I know and don't have a reason to not like get them. And if they don't say thanks, they got thier last res.<br />
<br />
I have gotten a lot of ppl who are like the stories you have told me about. Ignorant demanding little newbie kids. They never get a res and never hear about them again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">04-11-2000, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm with you.  I have gone anon simply because I usually forget to turn it off when I go through newbie land (dear GOD why do they think I've got 2098320498095 plat in the bank?).<br />
<br />
I occasionally will run through a lower level dungeon (Unrest is a good one) and look for recently dead bodies.  I see if they're still logged on, and offer them a rez.<br />
<br />
I had one little buttwad, when I asked if he wanted an exp rez (I was 48th at the time) what level I was.  I told him it was none of his business, and did he want one or not?  He said, &quot;are you 49th?&quot;  I replied that if he wanted a 49/50th level rez, to ask another cleric who was in the zone.  Stuck him in my ignore list.<br />
<br />
That's one of the only times that's happened to me, tho.  Most newbies are really grateful for some extra exp after they die, and I do so love helping folks out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had that one too.<br />
<br />
I was un Unrest goofing off while waiting for our kedge group to form up.  Running through the house buffing folks and derailing trains and helping the little 18s kill some yard trash.<br />
<br />
Someone shouted for a res on the side porch.  So I sent him a tell that i could res him.  The guy was 27.<br />
<br />
He responded back &quot;Can you hurry up?&quot;<br />
<br />
I answered &quot;I'm at your body but need to med up the mana, res costs 500 mana ya know&quot;<br />
<br />
He replied &quot;500?  I thought it was 700?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said &quot;The 49th res is 700, the 39th is 50&quot;<br />
<br />
He replied &quot;Oh your not 49?  nevermind&quot;<br />
<br />
So I walked off and was on my way to the zone when...<br />
<br />
He replied &quot;Can you res me, noone here is 49&quot;<br />
<br />
I answered &quot;Sorry, I'm leaving now, my group awaits&quot;<br />
<br />
He starts begging and whining.<br />
<br />
I zone out to find hgim sitting outside the zone in his underware.<br />
<br />
I /bonked him and waved and trundeled on my merry way while he begged to the empty air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">04-12-2000, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember how jazzed I was when I first got revive - our main group that we've had for almost a year now is composed of me, my husband the enchanter, a warrior and a paladin.  Me and the hub can bind, but the guys can't (plus, the warrior's an ogre).  So I about bust a seam when I finally made 29th - and revive.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I remember someone in Guk at about 30th asking for a rez.  I offered my services, and they completely snubbed me because I was 49th or 39th.  I said, &quot;fine, maybe your friend can wait until I'm 39th, it'll only be another month or so...&quot;<br />
<br />
20 minutes later, no one else would rez them either.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scoral Derarzt</div><div class="date">04-13-2000, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well ive read all the threads in theis forum and only have one thing to say on the subject.I will never refuse a res to a fellow cleric or someone who has givin me a port.Notice I said give?Just because you ported me for 10 plat doesnt obligate me to give you a res when you ask for one.You were paid in full for the port or other service you performed for me and a donation to the temple would be appreciated even if it is only a few muffins or bandages.That is the role playing aspect of a cleric.Im sure everyone of us have played pen and paper rpg's and are playing clerics cause we remember how.When in game when was the last time a cleric in waterdeep regenerated or brought you from the dead for no cost?Usually there was a quest involved and that was your priority.But please keep in mind that for all the tells and bugging ppl inflict on us,it is the fellow clerics that have the hardest time finding a res.Most of the time all I want is a revbive to return to my corpse and I dont feel i deserve an exp res because I cant cast it yet.But a level 49 cleric asking a level 49 cleric for a res should be done regardless of time restraints.You never know when a res is gonna help you and that refusal may be the only one there to help.As for other classes ,I couldnt give a happy whattaudo whether they get resses or not because usually they are makin money on their spell lists such as sow,,,port...clarity,but they expect a res for free on the spot from johnny cleric, or you are an arsehole for not doin it.I myself have kept a list from level 4 to now of ppl I will never help because of either just being jerks about spells or buffs,and I also have my holy list of ppl that were significantly higher than I and have saved my burning butt more than I care to count.Those ppl will always have a res from me and i will help them every chance i get.Ppl want a cleric in the group when it suits them and when it doesnt,they forget us. <br />

I intend to stay off of /anon or /role for as long as I can stand it. I just hope that I can field the rez requests with the same humor and patience that all of you have so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">04-18-2000, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess this one has several aspects that I'm noticing..<br />
<br />
A) Some people always demand to know your level before you res.<br />
<br />
(These I don't answer and tell them to find another cleric to res them, Yes, Ofbac, I've done that, EVEN at Level 50   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif - I was 48 once, I know how that feels to other clerics, it's been done to me, more times than I can count)<br />
<br />
B) I see alot of people demanding resses - This is a pet peeve, right along with the &quot;Are you level 49?&quot; (Hmmm.. Wonder if I should answer yes, and cast revive.. Grrrr... I don't do this but, damn, some days I WISH... Sigh)<br />
<br />
C) Going anon DOES NOT WORK. If you EVER do a 49 res for someone, you can bet they remember you! I don't mind doing resses for other clerics, ever. I don't mind doing resses for friends of those clerics that I know and work with. Sometimes I'll request a cleric res a friend of mine if they're in the same area, sometimes I'll receive those requests and honor them. The first time I did a 49 res, I got buried doing about 30 resses at the zone of LGuk. I went anon, happened again as soon as I asked who was holding the lists for Ghoul Lord and Frenzied. Bam! Instant tell hell. I was doing resses until my name got called 2 hours later. <br />
<br />
D) You get those that are TRULY thankful for getting it. Couldn't think of a better day to be a cleric.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
One of my all-time favorites:<br />
<br />
We found a werewolf on tracking.. Decided to take it out.. Run for werewolf, and there are bodies all over from a small group that got floored. The first body I found, closest to the camp, was their cleric. I offered a res, they accepted, and saved them a run. They were thrilled. We buffed them up, and set them back to bandit hunting.. Really good feeling. I still keep in touch with that cleric. <br />

The ones that ask me to res, then can't find the body are annoying, but not a big issue (had one who thought DA would last long enough for me to find his body for him in the Sol A lava pools), but not sending me a /tell until after I've traveled zones out of my way to help warrants an entry on the &quot;do not res list&quot;.<br />
<br />
I will say this though - I've never gotten an impolite response when I turn down a res request.  Must be lucky I guess...<br />
