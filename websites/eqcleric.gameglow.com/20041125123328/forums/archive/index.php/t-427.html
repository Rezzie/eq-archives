<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaldiana D'Ozz</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After my long and annoying Fri/Sat (see my other post (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003448.html)), thankfully Sunday was a very different day.<br />
<br />
I first logged on with my SK and managed to get her to level 27 (woohoo, only 3 more til Feign Death!).  Then I got Aal on and spent a couple of hours outside the portal to Fear buffing those that were doing the suicide runs for their items. (And as an update, it took ages, but anyone who was online DID retrieve their items.)<br />
<br />
Eventually I decided to go try to make back some of my lost xp, when I get a tell from a friend asking me to go to Hate.  I really thought I shouldn't given that xp was a concern but I ended up saying yes because I figured hell, I might as well try for some &quot;reward for my risk&quot; (as Verant likes to say).  So a quick port later I'm sitting in Nek Forest, buffing people and going to Hate.<br />
<br />
To make a long story short (too late, I know): &lt;UL&gt; I made it through the raid with no deaths for myself<br />
 Only 3 of my party members had even one death and that was due to a mispull of Maestro that lead to a camp out   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
 I ended up looting EM Gloves and Legs!  The gloves were on my loot turn and the legs were by default (all the other clerics there had them).  My wis is now 190.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
 I had a mage and a wizzie in my group, so I managed to get enough xp that I'm only needing 1 bub to get 50 back.<br />
 and I won a Black Sapphire (which, it's scary to say, still does not cover the cost of all the peridots I went through this weekend between the two planes  *sigh*)[/list]<br />
<br />
So, at least I ended the weekend on a high note.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
The legs are AWESOME!<br />
<br />
Altho you might want to test the Cleric Quest gloves vs. the EM gloves, I got 2 more AC with the Quest Gloves due to the plus AGI on them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats and congrats!  I got my SK to 31 yesterday.  Thirty is an incredible spell level for SKs:  Feign Death (the best), Invisibility (it's so nice to be able to invis yourself after 53 levels as a cleric), the new Dot (Heat Blood), and the new Lifetap (45 hit points for well over the 63 mana listed sucks, but 45 hit points is still better than what we had).<br />
<br />
Also, the legs are an incredible item.  I love mine.<br />
<br />
I'm down to waiting for my BP.  Going to Hate tonight.  Third trip that I'm up for it (hehe, last trip I go to bed and the BP drops).  Also, I wear the quest gloves due to the increased AC.<br />
