The guise of the deceiver.  Now it must be equipped to work, and only rogues and bards can use it.<br />

I've been trying to get friends to help me camp that guise for a long, long time...and now i'll never get it.  Yay.<br />

<br />
It would be STOOPID for Verant to change the way the guise works because currently (besides shrink), it's the only way for orges and trolls to successfully navigate dungeons like SolB. Who wants to be running from a train and get blocked by some large race PC?<br />

Very, very dumb on Verant's part.  I really feel bad for the large races out there who don't have a guise yet.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif  Me, I just wanted it, I didn't *need* it.  Ogres and trolls need the thing.</div></div><hr />

  It was a fun item...for about one day. I guess if you had one you would understand that its not all that. <br />
  Over all i have to agree with Verant's move. From the get go i found it strange that a mask with this certain power could be used without wearing it. I have an ogre warrior and i must say i was looking forward to getting a mask to shave off a few tons  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif Ill just have to adjust and hope some other item can reduce my size or that i can find shamans to group with when i hit Guk and Sol B.</div></div><hr />

And no, the orge/troll size issue wasn't solved with the inclusion of shrink. The only people I've seen cast it are shamen and on Xegony, I don't see a lot of high level shamen. My troll warrior friend WOULDN'T go to SolB until he got the mask because of the size problems. It's very useful for those who don't want to wait for a shamen to show in order to enjoy the game.<br />

Because it was kewl, no one else played one and they just ROCK. Now everywhere i go people are DE and it just SUCKS from roleplay perspective and game perspective.  I'm sick of everyone being able to goto neriak because they have a mask yet i cant goto faydwer because there IS no goodie goodie mask.  I say take the item out all together, thats your own fault for playing a big race or a race without ultra vision  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Now I AM NOT complaining about my choice of race! I knew my what I was up against when I chose a dark elf.  But that there wasn't an opposite of it, guise of the goodie goodie elf ( joke! ) that would allow ME to travel freely always irked me.  I think that the change was due.  If Verant screwed up, it was when they allowed it to be used without equiping, in the very begining.  I'm sure the flames will follow.</div></div><hr />

The Troll warrior in my group really wanted one.  His size made it very difficult at times to play in dungeons (I should say almost all the time).<br />
<br />
Perhaps Verant will come out with a shrink potion that costs 3-4 pp per use?  Or maybe some new magician summoned item?  Or *gasp* when they fix alchemy, make it so that Shamans can make a shrink potions.  I like the last idea best.<br />

A Guise DOES NOT make it so you can travel freely ANYWHERE. It never did, it never will.<br />
<br />
You are still KOS because of your religion (unless your agnostic, and only then you have to have increased your Evil faction to one level higher then Dubious for it to work). The mask actually REDUCES the areas you can travel to (normally AMIABLE merchants are now KOS because your a DE).<br />
<br />
The Mask had 2 uses. SHRINK for large races, and UltraVision.<br />

From an RP stand point, I hated the mask, simply because it never made sense for any but a bard or rogue to be anble to use it, IMO. Now, I admit, this might cause a problem for some large ones out there, but the appropriate fix would be for another item to be put in, or as was stated, alchemy to be fixed and shamen to be able to make shrink potions. No offense, but as a shaman, I'm glad for this, not only does my shrink spell become even more effective and demanded, but now I have a reason to buy my ultravision spell. I ALWAYS hated that, by the time I got that spell, it was doable to get the mask. Hurray for Verant on this one, bith in the change and in leaving the existing masks alone. Get over it, and adjust your groups/tactics to cope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The largest (And I do use the term losely) reason is for large races. The next time your ass gets trained to zone and die because you couldnt pass some big troll or ogre, you can only blame verant for nurfing the spawn.<br />
<br />
The second largest are for those races who have no night vision (like me). Sure you can have a shaman or magi cast/summon night vision on you, but why? Just like jboots, at the higher levels you obtain these... speed and night vision are only a nuscence and being a race or class who can see invis has nor group benifit what so ever. (I do know i will NOT seek/incite a class simply because they can cast see invis or shrink)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">12-08-1999, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bad news? No way! This is some of the best news to come out of a patch in a long time. How I hated that item! How wrong is it for there to be a uniquely powerful item that is immensely useful for all races but one?<br />
<br />
The advantages of being a dark elf come with huge drawbacks, and it is eminently unfair to provide all the advantages without any of the drawbacks to anyone willing to camp the item.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge, there are only two items in the entire game that alone can dramatically affect the capability of a character. The existence of these items provide huge advantages to people who spend unhealthy amounts of time playing EQ over more casual players. One of them was the guise, and I am very glad to see it go. Hopefully, the other item that fits this definition - jboots - will not be long for Norrath either.<br />
<br />
Before the whiners start name-calling, consider how you would feel if an item appeared that gave XP-restoring ressurrection. That's how a shaman feels when Shrink/Ultravision is rendered useless by the guise; that's how a druid feels when jboots eliminate the need for his bread-and-butter SoW; that's how the magician feels when his 29th-level coldstone spell is worthless because anyone at that level can get their own (mana-less!) ultravision.<br />
<br />
The only mistake Verant made on this one was leaving the existing guises unchanged. (Before you start whining, cross-reference: Monk, Feign Death)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugu</div><div class="date">12-09-1999, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couldnt agree more.<br />
Only mistake about that change was existing masks stayed in game.<br />
<br />
If you want to look like a Dark Elf, Create one!<br />
If you think your big ogre warrior is too big, find a smaller race!<br />
All races are balanced in the way they look, factions and abilities. Guise made any class have both their own race benefits and Dark Elf benefits like ultravision, size and faction if you were agnostic.<br />
This is way unbalanced for any other race than Dark Elfs.<br />
BTW, the guise is kind of bugged on team PVP servers btw.. you cant shoot arrows on a race that use guise, BUT you can cast spells. Go figure..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">12-09-1999, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fi you check the stats, the guise has always been bard/rogue only.    It was only a fluke that it could be used from inventory.<br />
<br />
I am tired of everyone who thinks that being a dark elf is cool, running around as a dark elf and suffering no penalties for it. <br />
<br />
The mask was clearly intended to be a way that rogues (and bards, who are very similar to rogues) could infiltrate evil cities and/or disguise themselves.<br />
<br />
But really, think about it.  Would a paladin EVER disguise themselves a a dark elf?  Get real.<br />
<br />
The mask should have ben chanegd long ago.  And when they changed it now, it should have been retroactive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminar</div><div class="date">12-09-1999, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reality check... greg... ask your closest high level shaman if he gives 2 ****s if his shrink and ultravision is wanted by others?<br />
<br />
I think with all the other half a dozen buff spells hes constantly casting, he could care less if ultravision or shrink was one of them. <br />
<br />
Also the mask gave no huge advantages, it gave night vision... ok... but you where still kos to dark elves and trolls and ogres. disadvantages? How about sometimes being KOS to good (Barbarian guards hate dark elves with a vengance) and most often that not, you cant use any vendors except a handfull in the lands like commons and sro and karana.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at the negative impacts on everyone else this will have which you seem to compleatly miss. <br />
<br />
#1 group members have a hard time seeing at night... or if your traveling outdoors... could be severly delayd while looking for someone to cast night vision on them.<br />
<br />
#2 hallways and zones being impassable by large races. (namely trolls and ogres, thats right, the dark elves dark cousins... who prolly dont even need or care for any faction changes the mask might give them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">12-09-1999, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think those two problems are quite solvable with the standard suite of abilities in the game. For vision problems, there must be a dozen different spells and items that can deal with it - all the globe of light type spells, infravision, ultravision, heatstones and coldstones, lightstones, light-giving objects and more. So I must disagree that that problem should have any weight in the consideration of keeping this item in the game.<br />
<br />
The size issue I will concede to be more valid, but again I don't think it is of such overwhelming importance that this item is neccessary. Being a large-size race does have the disadvantage of getting stuck, blocking halls, etc., but people knew that when they created their characters. The tradeoff of being large is to get very formidable physical characteristics - str, sta, and in the case of trolls, faster regeneration. And again, shrink solves this problem. Not enough shamen around? Well, if their unique ability to shrink suddenly becomes so important that large warriors won't go into dungeons without it, then you will start to see many more high level shamen. They should definitely remove the group-members-only restriction on shrink (and while they're at it, invis and cancel magic) to make it more practical.<br />
<br />
Now, if the guise reduced the person's base str to 65 (normal DE str) or came with some other major negative (say, the effect lasts two Norrath days and cannot be cancelled or removed before its natural expiration) I would have less or no objection to it. <br />
Another possibility would be to have a guise of the goody-goody as suggested above to balance the advantage given to good races, but this is not my favored solution.<br />
<br />
As far as being KOS, not being able to use merchants etc while wearing the guise, I don't think that is valid reasoning. After all, you can turn off the effect. And if the major purpose is to navigate in dungeons, well, anything in a dungeon will be KOS anyway regardless of your faction or race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">12-10-1999, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greg: No, you can't turn off the effect. However you can zone, and like all illusions, the effect will disappear. Also, about large races, it will not only hurt them when they try to go through the small hallways, but also any other player trying to run from a train where the big guy happens to be in the way. I have been saved by a guise a few times already...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a mask..and yup..bnefore the patch.  Almost never use it..  Except when I am running across Nektolous to Lavastorm.<br />
<br />
Before I had the mask...I REALLY REALLY wanted it..now that I have it...well..I think its kinda of a waste..have even considered leaving it in the bank...<br />
<br />
It does NOT allow you to run into evil cities.  Religion is the factor here.  Yes it gives you infravision, but thats about it, and as a dwarf the size change isn't a factor.<br />
<br />
Will it impact on large races?  Probably..you'll never catch an unmasked ogre in Sol B or Lguk...maybe this means they are finally fixing alchemy...and shrink potions?<br />
<br />
Its kida strange but if you read the mask its bard or rogue only...and technically, you would think, that the effect should only happen when its equipped.  The same with Jboots.<br />
<br />
Yeah I'll probably get stomped by a train to zone with a big OGRE blocking the way...thats the game...chances are..he'll die too..unless he gets shrunk.  Yeah more shamans!<br />
<br />
And as an aside...you can't change Cancel Magic or Invis to work on non party members, (though shrink shouldn't harm anything if cast on a non party member)..You know how many morons there are out there that would invis a Necro/Magician/Enchanter in the middle of a fight JUST to get the pet to suicide?!?!?!  Added to that do you know how many morons are out there that would cancel your buffs...just BECAUSE you can't do anything back!?!?!?<br />

Your yammering on about an item you apparently know NOTHING about. <br />
<br />
1. you CANNOT remove the guise effect unless you zone.<br />
2. it has NO positive effect for the wearer, except shrink and vision.<br />
<br />
Thats it, nothing else. Its not unbalancing, its not overpowering. All it does it give someone a new look. So what? Inkies ticked about it? Big fricken deal. <br />
<br />
I got a mask, and I love it. I would be pissed if Verant removed an item in my inventory that I had died for (or vice versa). If its ingame for 9 months, leave it alone.<br />

<br />
#1 light sources - Globe of lights are the farthest thing of any night vision you can get, most summoned light sources dont even match a greater light stone. Half the classes have self only night vision spells.. and then theres others who can cast or summon some sort of night vision for you... but high enough level magis and shamans are few and far between. And if you thought gate and res request where annoying. Imagin all the people who would msg the closest magi as SOON as he logged on, no death or long distance traveling required to have a summong clodstoe request. As for items, theres 1.. thats right.. 1.. a glowing band ring.. gives infra vision... it will do but it replaces a ring so I wouldnt wear it in combat since i would be missing +6 wisdom. And at high levels... are you still going to account type of night vision with any issue of class balence? I guess you get some sick satisfaction when some people literally cant see ANYTHING at night (Make an erudite and walk around at night, it really is pitch black) because verant's light engine dosnt work like it should with lightstones.<br />
<br />
#2 size... your right, everyone who picked a large race should have known there size was gona be a problem... but i'll have you know its a much bigger problem for the people around them, not the big guy himself. And with the fact theres so few shamans around to shrink not to mention you need them grouped, shrinking is not going to be an option.<br />
<br />
I think the #1 reason so many of you are not worried about the large race problem is because you wont see alot of it just yet. Because most people who are large and in high level dungions have a mask allready. which is why I made a dare to verant to remove all current mask (or change them to the new ones). Because I KNOW as soon as verant would do this, chaos would ring out as large races clogged dungions all over and no one cold move anywhere where, and id bet real money atleast half of you pro guise change people would change your tune. that is after you pull that big nasty train of bats/spiders, run to zone, and scream at the ogre medding at zone to &quot;use his mask&quot; so you can get out.</div></div><hr />

You are very wrong my friend about the mask not letting you go into cities.  I have spent alot of time killing ogre bouncers in Ferrott.  Well they drop a nice 11pp sword and the stein of moggok.  Well I use my mask to go into Oggok to sell to the merchant near the zone.  With out it the merchant scowls at me with it i am apprehensive.  Of course the bouncers hate me in either form but selling to the merchant saves alot of down time.<br />

Speak for yourself about problems getting passed big races! I have a halfling cleric and I just crawl in between their legs or do a giant underfoot jump over their shoulder and into the next zone area.<br />

So you play a race without nightvision. So you're blind in the dark.<br />
<br />
So what? You KNEW this when you made your character in the first place. The other races who DO have nightvision pay an experience penalty for it.<br />
<br />
You want nightvision? Then bloody well MAKE a character who has nightvision, or be very good friends with a shaman, an enchanter or a mage.<br />
<br />
The old guise was a BUG. Verant NEVER intended them to be used by classes other than Rogues and Bards. I am neither. I'm not a dark elf either. But I can see why they hate the guise so much. YOU try playing a race who's hated everywhere, but going through it anyway because you wanted to be different, and then discover that every Tom, Dick and Harry can be a DE with ultravision anytime they bloody well want with a bugged item.<br />
<br />
The only valid point I can see in your post is size problems. The group I normally hunt with have 3 tanks: 1 ogre and 2 troll warriors. It's a pain in the butt when we're hunting in places like sol a. And we can't always find a shaman around to help out either. Instead of complaining about the guise change, do what I do. Give a feedback to verant about it (that's why that /feedback command is there), and suggest a quest item that gives unlimited charges of shrink or something.<br />
<br />
PLEASE stop whining about the guise change. It wasn't meant to work that way in the first place. Verant has been more than fair in not changing the guises that's already in people's possessions, only changing the new drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it was NOT a bug. It was allways ment to work by right clicking it. Verrant just didnt think (a commond problem) that so many people other then bards and rogues would use it this way. And its been this way for HOW many months? And verrant decides to change it now. I couldnt give 2 ****s if your a hated race. i couldnt give 2 ****s if I turn into a dark elf. But Verrants broke ass vertex lighting which does not work properly makes the game UNPLAYABLE at night in outdoor areas. that IS a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I don't give a rat's ass for your problems either. I hope you have fun stumbling in the dark. Want to see at night? Go start a new character.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping that you'd stumble onto a hill giant's toe the next time you grope in the dark. Cheers!<br />
<br />
PS. to all you other blind hummies out there, this obviously doesn't apply to the rest of you. Only to Mr. &quot;I don't give a rat's ass&quot; here.</div></div><hr />

FYI, Verant didn't intend the guise to be used the way it is, being able to right click it in inventory was a bug and was talked about a lot on the beta development boards when it and other items poped up. Verant never was able to figure out how to make activatable items only work when they are equiped, and still have the effect work correctly. They tried several times in beta, it always ended up killing the effect for some reason, so they apparently gave up and left the items in the game till they could get back around to working on the problem.<br />
As for the blindness issue, well, nobody held a gun to your head and forced you to gimp yourself by clicking human...... =P<br />

Have you ever added up and Erud Clerics stats and find that they have 14 less over all points? Then find they dont have Night Vision/Regen/or huge str bonus? Ya, Verant really hates the dark races. Well one at least.<br />
<br />
BTW I love my guise, and they wont be taking it from ANY of my chars anytime soon.<br />
