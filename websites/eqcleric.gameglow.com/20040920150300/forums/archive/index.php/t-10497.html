I went from 20-21 in 2 days of playing a few hours a day. Plus you can get the Shiny Brass Halbert from the named Orc..cant use it but you can sell it for 150PP!<br />
I went down into the jail area...some things down there are nasty...wait till your 30.<br />
<br />
East Karana is great! You can hunt Crag Spiders by the Ramp to HPH. You can hunt Gnoll Reavers and Undead Gnoll Reavers by the water near the bridge. I got a lot of XP here and its easy to run if you get overwhelemed.<br />
<br />
West Karana: This place is great for clerics 18-21/22. There is a farm with a good supply of Scarecrows (Jack O' Lanters from unrest). Root and expulse undead in 4 hits. I went from 18-19 here Solo.<br />

<br />
Got a pickup group, buffed up the 5 members of group and away we went.<br />
<br />
I usually wait til player is half HPs til I start healing.<br />
<br />
But this awful thing happened nearly everytime I healed and my group was fighting multiple mobs: one of the orcs would leave the melee and start attacking me. Yes, attacking me, a Priest of Brell.<br />
<br />
Of course, I can't heal too well while getting whacked so it turned into big mess.<br />
<br />
What's going on? I hade my rogue up here about 6 weeks ago and I don't remember heal being such a huge taunt. I'd certainly remember peeling a mob off a cleric every 5 minutes. And I never saw this kind of predictable behavior in CB or Oasis even with multiple mobs. Are these orcs smarter than average?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Use Light Healing and heal bit by bit?<br />

If you pull some uglies on you, just notify your group &quot;orc on me&quot; or some such. Any tanks worth thier salt will know that they need to make getting the uglies off you a priority. <br />
<br />
If you go hog-wild of nukes or heals, you may work yourself to a point where your tank comrades cannot get em off ya. Big warning there.<br />

<br />
that seems to work for me  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
I also have one which says 'RUN RUN RUN RUN...ZONE NOW....RUN RUN RUN'<br />
Seem to use this one in Mistmoore A LOT!<br />

<br />
I have a hot-key that says &quot;GIT THIS THIN' OFF ME SO I KIN HEAL YE!&quot;  It's usually ignored by the tanks in the group when I'm fighting Highhold Pass orcs.<br />
<br />
Solution One:  Just keep casting your Healing as needed.  Between high AC and good channeling, I can still heal half the time with one orc on me.  The odds get substantially worse with three (which I've had happen before at that location).<br />
<br />
Solution Two:  Cast Daring instead of Healing.  It casts as fast, costs the same, and heals almost as many hit points.  I've heard that it does still taunt, but less so than the Healing.  I haven't fully tested this yet.<br />
<br />
Solution Three:  Get in a group that has another cleric.  That way there's almost always someone available who can cast Healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mayur</div><div class="date">01-20-2000, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well in a location like HH where there are no other mobs around the corner from the orcs, why not blind them and step back? the orc should be blinded and run away (hes not going to come back with help, if anything he will run to the guards and be slaughtered). you can continue with your heal in peace. <br />
<br />
or cast root, you can usually get it off and step back. but i prefer blind (fast, low resist, low mana) and then finish your heal.<br />
<br />
of course this isnt recommended in a dungeon with unseen dangers lurking, but in HH it seems to make sense.<br />
<br />
and i agree, using hotkeys in pickup groups may or may not work. many pickup tanks just kill and loot, not worrying about the healer who they expect to be meding, healing and loving it.</div></div><hr />

Best to have a full party and to have at least one or two who can do magic direct damage, Magician, Druid or Wizard. Another Cleric will do in a pinch. Lots of loot and some good XP.<br />
