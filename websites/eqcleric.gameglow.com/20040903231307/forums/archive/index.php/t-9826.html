I freely pass out Pinzarn, but who can pass out a 10-14 plat reagent. Oh sure they can bring their own and some do. But still its very expensive. <br />
<br />
Besides, How come we are the only class paying for a PURE HP buff? Shamans are not required to pay for Talisman, Which is a GREAT SPELL. As usual &quot;Screw the Clerics&quot; (sigh)<br />

That group was a very good group, and even with 7 Greater Kobolds and a Noble (trained onto us by someone who thought he was being helpful), we held out very well</div></div><hr />

Explain the cost vs how many extra hitpoints they will recieve per cast to them, you'll be pleasantly suprised how many will go buy a stack of 10-20 and carry them constantly after that.  I've never met a brother or sister cleric who would refuse to cast a symbol on someone who: <br />
<br />
1.  asked politely<br />
2.  carry their own stones<br />
<br />
Regular or &quot;pick-up&quot; group, I'll hand out freebies to break tough rooms and I usually try to keep our enchanter symboled full time as long as I have enough stones.  Your enchanter can and will save as many or more lives than we will if you properly protect them.<br />

<br />
I've handed regeants to chanters in my groups before, asking for rune on everyone, and they're happy to comply.<br />
<br />
I also follow up with symbol.<br />
<br />
Has to be a really rough spawn or raid for me to do this though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
     for those of you in guilds, have the guild set up a &quot;slush fund&quot; for caster reagents. Mine has doen so and it works great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyfist</div><div class="date">04-03-2000, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, magicians have it worse with their Phantom Armor line.  They pay expensive reagents for an AC buff that at its highest I believe is about 20AC for the level 36 version.  Funny how most mages never use that buff...<br />
The symbol line is costly, true.  That's why you'd never catch me casting it on anyone but the one or two people in a party who take the most hits in a fight.  Symbol is only insurance, when you think about it.  Under ordinary circumstances, the tank should never get low enough for the extra 73-200 hps to mean the difference between life and death.  If he does, that means the party is up to their necks in trouble, and the symbol might well be saving everyone's life.  Think on it when next you consider the expense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">04-03-2000, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I haven't quite hit the cost of ~12pp per cast, but the way I think of things is this way.<br />
<br />
I usually group with 1 main tank (warrior), 1 backup tank (bard, ranger), nuker  (wiz/mage/druid/shaman), enchanter, and cleric.<br />
<br />
When breaking spawn everyone gets full buffs with endures as appropriate, no matter what they may want.  I tell the druid to never do their skin, as bravery (at the moment) is better, and I'd rather have it on them.  If possible I also have everyone Runed, and Talismaned by the shaman.<br />
<br />
That ensures that A) I don't have to worry too much about calling evac the moment we run into big nasties, B) It gives me enough time to finish off that gheal on the nuker and stun whatever the heck is hitting said nuker so the chanter can get the mez off, or C) to save my very bestest best friend, the Chanter, from getting hurt too much.<br />
<br />
Same goes for once broken, however I only do the symbol for FREE on the pure casters, and the druid can do sls or whatever if they feel like.  If I join a pickup group then I politely let them know that I'm always taking donations for symbol and a couple plat will ensure that I have the said stones to cast it.  Never have I once heard of any tank thats worth the armor they're wearing complain about paying me for that.  Nor casters at that.<br />
<br />
I attribute it to the fact that paying for a little 6gp (soon to get worse I know) stone to save the trouble of them dying from lack of hitpoints is heavily worth it to people.<br />
<br />
Occassionally I just toss random buffs out, and if I'm really in the mood I'll toss out the symbols.<br />
<br />
Except, when someone says, out of nowhere, &quot;buff me.&quot;  No please, no excuse me ma'am, but just &quot;buff me.&quot;   Time to flip to page fifty in the trusty spellbook and pick out the low lvl stuff =)<br />

Everyone gets in on a place / dragon type encounter. <br />
<br />
Other than that, if they want it, they have to pay.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">04-12-2000, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone else done any studies with the peridot (Naltron) compared to the jasper?<br />
<br />
It looks like, for an additional 10pp, you get about 100 more hp.  Is that really worth that much money?  I'd rather buy 100 jaspers and spend less than 10 peridots.. 100 hp doesn't seem like it's worth the money or the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morganna</div><div class="date">04-13-2000, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Peridots (Naltron) give approx 500HP boost.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the use of reagents is up to you of course. YOU decide when you should use Jaspers, and when to use Peridots.<br />
<br />
With CHA of 115, Jaspers cost me 7gold 8 silver and Peridots - 10pp 5 gold.<br />
<br />
I usually go with Jaspers and only Peridot the Enchanter, IF the enchanter is in my group. (and send tells to him making sure he has his Naltron on)<br />
<br />
Exceptions include when we are ABOUT to charge Dragon or God, then everyone in my group gets Reso / Shield of Words / Naltron / Resists and all that crap.<br />
<br />
Other than that, you decide for yourself. True, Peridots don't come cheap. Try spending 800pp on Reagents on 1 PoA raid .. kindda takes your breath away :P<br />
<br />
If you are not privy to a &quot;slush fund&quot; which absorbs your cost, explain to the group you are in , let them know your difficulties, I'm sure they will re-imburse you happily.</div></div><hr />

I only checked at.. uh.. 47th I think?  On the Naltron vs. Ryltan (whatever jasper is, I always forget).<br />
<br />
Seemed like it only added 400 or so, but obviously ay 50th it will be a little more.  Just wondering if anyone else had any good proof that Naltron really did kick butt.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  My paladin is always giving me the peridots he picks up with his druid in S Karana, so I don't have much of a shortage.. I just feel a little sick when I think about how much mana and money one stinky spell costs.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">04-18-2000, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in my case the group I adventure with is very aware of the reagent's costs for the Symbol line - and are feeding them to me as needed. We have been camping the Reckless Efreeti spawn in Sol A recently, and they let me loot all of the Bloodstones (dropped by the Blazing Elementals) in anticipation of my casting Symbol of Ryltan next level. To date I have collected 81 and counting! I have no illusions about finding a mob which drops alot of Jasper or Peridot, though.<br />

I will definitely check that out the next time I hunt in SK. I won't be close to Spectres anytime soon I hope - hunting in Oasis has cured me of wanting to see them up close for quite awhile to come yet...  <br />
