<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ethel Etana</div><div class="date">03-23-2001, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know how many of y'all have tried out the new Faydedar, or been lucky enough to find the real Faydedar up, but wanted to offer the info that I could and also ask a question.<br />
<br />
I've now gone on a triggered Faydedar raid twice and have vastly different experience with both of them.  The first time was a complete success, very few deaths.  The second time was a total agonizing failure followed my one of the most hideous CR's I've ever been involved in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, the first time I went out there (it was the same night as the patch that made him triggerable whenever that was) I didn't have my resist gear with me as it was all kind of spur of the moment.<br />
<br />
We went out, buffed up, triggered him and stomped the snot out of him.  At 54, with around 109 MR and 115 FR buffed, I resisted all of his fears and most of his fire AE with no trouble--I think I popped a cel heal on myself once.  The 60th druid in question got her piece, and all was well.  We rezzed the few deaths, everyone cleared, we ported out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The second time, however, was completely different.  We had about 27 folks, but were short on clerics--only two of us.  This time I had all of my fire resist gear with me (Inluding my new +20 FR Blazing Breastplate of Fennin Ro I got helping with Rage on Monday), and a good bit of Magic.  My buffed MR was around 140 and FR of around 190.  Add to this I was in the group with a 56 bard--so my resists were literally through the roof during battle.<br />
<br />
Anyway, when we spawned Fayd we had casters/healers and tanks separated to make sure tanks got initial aggro.  As soon as Fayd spawned the first wave of Fire AE hit--and took about a bub and a half of my health.  We'd crap buffed for the dispells so I knew I hadn't lost Marzin or Hero, I really lost some insane percentage of my health.  I thought fluke, it'll get better.<br />
<br />
As the fight goes on I realize that evertime there's fire AE I'm getting hit full.  Over and over.  I pop a few cel heals on myself but there's just nothing I can do and eventually I die.  In addition, I even get feared a few times.<br />
<br />
I died, of course--as did everyone else.  We had some very wierd aggro early on and he wiped out about half of our casters before we could even blink in some maddening ping pong action as some of them ran around.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
So, I take the boat back into TD with a bard to start stick rezzing folks.  We have a couple of folks come with us to help test Fayd aggro to see how much of a pain CR is going to be.  Let me just tell you, Fayd aggros on you even BEFORE you get into the second tunnel--he just won't swim out to kill you.  As soon as you get inside, whether it be with invis, hide/sneak, or whatever he melees you to death.<br />
<br />
At one point I was sitting out on the wall right above the first tunnel--I'd even camped out to clear aggro since I'd been in the tunnel briefly and gotten feared when one of our druids tried invis.  A bard tried hide/sneak before going into the water and made it to the ramp up to Omat.  Fayd aggrod killed the bard and AGGRO'D Omat!  Omat starts doing damage to him and blammo, &quot;You will not evade me Ethel!&quot;.  Argh, another 10 minute swim out.  It was 2 hours before Fayd depopped of his own accord--while we were in the middle of sorting out just how we were gonna get folks back for summons.<br />
<br />
Faydedar killed Omat.  He killed the crazy monk guy.  He killed the merchant.  He killed all of us, some of us several times.  I'd hate to have been a cleric working on my epic about then. *sigh*  Oh yeah, and feared one of our enchanters about 15 feet into a wall.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, there's the whole horrid story.  I have some thoughts, though--<br />
<br />
1.  Faydedar didn't depop sooner because folks sitting on the wall outside/above the first tunnel were keeping him aggro.<br />
<br />
2.  Omat is not as strong as the Iksar Master and simply can't kill Faydedar.<br />
<br />
3.  Either they've beefed up Fayd's Fear and Fire, or there's some wierd crap going on with my resists.  Or I was just having a VERY unlucky evening on rolls.<br />
<br />
4.  Druids simply aren't worth this much trouble.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Like it overflows a character or something.  Is it possible your resists were over 255?<br />
<br />
I had resists of around 140 and did just fine with Faydedar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ethel Etana</div><div class="date">03-24-2001, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, I think I read a thread about resists where this was being debated.  I guess I remember it being that someone said there seemed to be a point of diminishing returns with resists.<br />
<br />
If there really is some point at which resists wrap around, egads.  Anyone have an experience with resists similar to this?  I mean, on this same raid we had a 54 monk (same level as I at the time) with resists far lower than mine resist most of the fire AE.  My fire resist was at least 150 higher than his I got hit full each time.<br />

We killed him once not too long ago using 12 people... I can't claim to have seen much upgrade, though I was surprised that I was taking significant damage from the aoe with fr240 at lvl 60.<br />

I was on a Fay killing at about level 52 or so, and not particularly well buffed nor equipped I resisted every fear and was barely damaged by the AE... not only that but I was able to keep a shaman alive after Fay freaked on him and not get aggroed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't notice anything out of the ordinary with AE fire damage and didn't get feared at all. MR was 140's with buffs and FR was 190 or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aquinas</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a thread recently on the official boards in which they stated that there is no &quot;wraparound&quot; effect with resists.  They did say, however, that dragon AE attacks are special in that there's a minimum chance to get hit regardless of your resist level -- sort of a &quot;soft cap&quot; for resists.  So, you may find that you get hit with dragon attacks more than you'd expect with extremely high resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nige Willowleaf</div><div class="date">04-04-2001, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes I think that it is a matter of luck when the tanks get womping on a dragon as to how the AE is going off. If you get everyone hitting and enough everybodys at the right time then it seems the dragons go down like zergs.<br />
<br />
Other times for some reason which I suspect is the timing of interrupts or if the mob is pulled away from the tanks and they miss hitting due to out of range (maybe a naughty caster starting nukes too early?) Then the draggie has more chance to cast uninterrupted. Once it starts moving around a lot you don't have much chance to keep all the melees on it consistently. And Faydedar is one naughty running around dragon. He is also small which makes it hard for all the meleers to get in there to hit.<br />
<br />
In your case - my guess is naughty caster scenario. Or you had a tank not properly buffed and a cleric ponged the dragon cause he had to cast a heal too early.<br />
<br />
Best of luck in any future encounters  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Sorry about your horried CR and thanks for posting. I will let my guild know to wait longer before going in there for CR should that ever be a necessity. And yes - it can happen to any guild.<br />
