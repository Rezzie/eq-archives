<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daku inochi</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to The Grey.. in the middle of the airless zone (yes, you'll need an Enduring Breath device/buff) you'll see a large colorful pyramid temple. Head to the west side of it and plop down at one of the corners.  This is your camp spot.<br />
<br />
The Shissar (snake guys) laying inside the ruins nearby are all undead and can be pulled one at a time. Get your Stun and favorite ROOT loaded and prepare yourself for a non-combat soloing experience.<br />
<br />
I found that the two Undead DOTs which I have (Turning of the Unnatural and Epitaph of Life) both stack with one another.  Start DOTing and rooting to your heart's content.  <br />
<br />
If you are a High Elf of Tunare, then do the quest for that necklace (most of it takes place in Lesser Faydark) which gives you a mana-less Ensnaring Roots clickable effect.  With the mana-regen component of Armor of the Risen self buff, you can pull, root and DOT these things all night long.  You'll be hard-pressed to run out of mana until you've gotten your third or fourth kill.  The Shissar don't have THAT many hit points.  They are decent experience and VERY vulnerable to Spook the Dead if things get ugly and you need some breathing room.<br />
<br />
I was there last night with a 60 druid and 60 warrior and we couldn't kill these things fast enough.  At one point, I was rooting/Dotting them while the Druid was pulling/DSing for the Warrior, who only needed a Comp Heal every 3 min or so.  It was insane XPs.<br />
<br />
Warning: The silvery millipedes which spawn in this zone are NOT rootable.  They are immune to speed change spells.  If you get one or two on you, just zone it.  They are not worth the trouble.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

I like the Undead Iksar camp personally.  Root, Undead Dot and repeat once - dead.<br />

It's kinda like the Oasis, only no SG's... and you happen to need EB.  I didn't realize the Shissar were undead, mainly because there are plenty... and I do mean plenty, of undead Iksar around the SD zone.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, not only is this the easiest zone I've ever fought in as a non-twink... but the loot can be phat.  Maybe not uberlicious, but certinally nicer then the danger's would warent.<br />
<br />
If you don't have an EB item, you can even collect snake guts from Shissar's and turn them in for a Kata quest(dunno the specifics)... 3 of'em nets you an EB neck item.</div></div><hr />

I was just wondering, y wud u use undead DoT when undead DD has a much better ratio, and is instant?  Just so it dosent give an extra root break test?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanya</div><div class="date">12-14-2001, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the dot so I don't have to keep healing myself every time the DD breaks the root. As it is now the root lasts full duration about 80 percent of the time.<br />

You use the DOT because in the time you can spend medding (after Turning and Epitaph are cast) you can gain some of that mana back.  You're going to be sitting on your duff anyway, may as well do it more safely than if you had to nuke.  And when the critter falls over dead, you still have 3+ bars full of mana left.<br />
<br />
Sample:<br />
<br />
Click-Root (from Warder's Symbol of Tunare quest neckpiece)<br />
Cast Epitaph DOT<br />
Cast Turning DOT<br />
Click-Root again<br />
<br />
Med till DOTs wear off.. repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
<br />
You never get hit.  You never have to worry about crowd control.  You can actually kill 2 mobs at a time if the situation presented itself to you (but I usually stick to 1 at a time).  You *don't* need help from anyone to do this.  And most importantly - you can do this WITHOUT the need for clarity.<br />

He will charm a Shissar Reverent for use as a tank. Depending on who has the most mana, one of us will pull another Shissar.  He'll slow the MOB while I land Epitaph and Turning of the Unnatural on them.  ***Make sure to have root and stuns up for when the charmed pet decides to eat the enchanter!***<br />
<br />
A charmed pet will normally last about 6-7 pulls, then we'll kill the pet, med up, and start all over again.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  (Not that medding up takes too long with the lurvely spell known as KEI!)<br />
<br />
Just my $0.02 - unless you're on Bertoxx, then ignore what I've said.  Stay out of the Grey.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
You can stack all 3 Cleric Undead DoT's<br />
<br />
1. Epitath of Life<br />
2. Turning of the Unnatural<br />
3. Sermon of the Righteous<br />
<br />
I solo and duo in the Grey 99% of the time =)I really hate those Shimmering Rockfiends!<br />
