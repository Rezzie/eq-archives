What irritates me about them is that they all confer a wisdom bonus in addition to providing a decent damage/delay ratio.<br />
<br />
On one hand, it's good for clerics because hopefully more shamen will use spears and less will want the 1h Blunt weapons that we require.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, these guys are really loading up on the nice weapons.  I wish there were more for us clerics.  That's strictly envy though.  I'm glad to see Verant helping out any class.  I just wish that there were more decent 1h Blunt weapons in the game.  Preferably of the cleric-only variety.<br />
<br />
(It kind of sucks that Druids can use scimitars as well as 1h Blunt and shamen can use spears as well as 1h Blunt, but we clerics are stuck with the short list of 1h Blunt weapons, most of which we share with others.  With the exception of the Caduceus of course.)<br />

The shaman spears can be equiped in the ranged slot.<br />

I've got some shamen in my guild, and they're great partymembers, and great friends... I'm gonna be going to get those for them and if I see Gull, some lucky cleric in my guild is getting arms...</div></div><hr />
