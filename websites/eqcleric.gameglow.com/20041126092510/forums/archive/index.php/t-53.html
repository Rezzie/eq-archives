<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harbron</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ever' Dwarf be gittin' shafted by th' merchants from th' time we be wee lads b'cause 'f our low ch'risma.  I now be ownin' 'nough ch'risma gear t' be boostin' me ch'risma up t' 103 fer me visits t' th' merchants.<br />
<br />
Even though th' gear be costin' me, it'll be payin' fer itself many times over b'cause I be gittin' better rates on a few 'xpensive thin's ... Tinkerer's Packs an' peridots.<br />
<br />
Here be what I be usin'.<br />
<br />
I be carryin' a Crude Stein which be givin' 15 ch'risma.  These be dropped by Bouncers in Oggok an' sell fer 10 t' 25pp.  Since they bin changin' th' guards, I be 'xpectin' th' prices t' be risin' 'gain as th' s'pply be dryin' up.<br />
<br />
On me neck I be wearin' a Split Paw Tooth Necklace which be pr'vidin' 5 ch'risma.  They be fairly common in Splitpaw.  They dinnae be costin' too much if'n ye be buyin' 'em.  I bin seein' 'em auctioned fer 20pp.  Alternative pieces be a Metal 'f Merit 'r an Order 'f Thunder from th' 'ppropriate Qeynos quests.<br />
<br />
On me ears I be wearin' a pair 'f Opalline Earrin's.  Each one be givin' 5 ch'risma.  They be droppin' off th' Undead Barkeep in Unrest.  I bin buyin' mine fer 40pp an' 50pp.<br />
<br />
On me wrists I be wearin' Gold Cat Eye Bracelets.  Each one be givin' 7 ch'risma.  I bin gittin' 'em at cost fer 15pp each.  Normal price be closer t' 30pp each.<br />
<br />
On me fingers I be wearin' Electrum Star Ruby Rings.  Each one be givin' 7 ch'risma.  I bin gittin' 'em at cost fer 70pp each.  Normal price be closer t' 140pp.<br />
<br />
Added t'gether that kin be boostin' yer ch'risma from 45 t' 103.  All this be easily 'vailable fer less'n 500pp.<br />
<br />
Ye think I be makin' up me 'nvestment when I be buyin' me Tinkerer's Pack?  How 'bout when I be buyin' a backpack full 'f peridots later in me carreer?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good call, Harbron.  I know the feeling, being an ugly halfling with only 50 charisma.<br />
<br />
Crude stein: yes.  Splitpaw necklace: yes.  Haven't bought any extra jewellery, but I should   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  <br />
<br />
For halflings, there's the +10 charisma leatherfoot raider's cap.  Actually, I have a feeling that the petitioner's version (from the first part of the quest) is wearable by all - go speak to Marshal Amrey in the Rivervale bank/warrior guild about this.  You don't get all the extra bonuses from the petitioner's cap vs. the raider's cap, but I think you do get the +10 charisma.<br />
<br />
Also: in South Qeynos, you can buy a silk evening tunic, AC 1, +5 CHA, for 5pp.  Sold by a vendor near, the Lion's Mane, I'm told - but I think it's medium/large races only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amanita</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm an enchanter, but I lurk these boards because my brother's a cleric, and I enjoy the community here. So naturally being an enchanter, I have my charisma gear in order =)<br />
<br />
Some of these items are pretty easily obtainable, others are not. I've given a couple options for some of the slots, depending on availability price and such. <br />
Just off the top of my head<br />
<br />
Ears: <br />
 Opalline Earrings +5 cha<br />
Neck: <br />
 Silver cat's eye +3 (jewelcraft)<br />
 Platinum cat's eye +9 (jewelcraft)<br />
 Split paw necklace +5<br />
 White Gold necklace +5 (i think)<br />
Face:<br />
 Silver star ruby veill +5<br />
 Platinum star ruby veil +9<br />
Head:<br />
 Crown of King Tranix (yeah right =) +15<br />
 Siryn Hair Hood +13<br />
Fingers:<br />
 Electrum star ruby rings +7<br />
Wrists:<br />
 Gold cat's eye bracelets +7 each<br />
Chest:<br />
 Silk Evening Tunic +5<br />
Legs:<br />
 Drake-hide leggings +5<br />
Off-hand:<br />
 Crude Stein +15<br />
<br />
So you see, if you're willing to swap equipment every time you go shopping, these items can pay for themselves fairly fast. There are a lot of charisma items out there, and as charisma is a &quot;non-important&quot; stat they often have large bonuses.<br />
<br />
A note about faction and price caps though. Your faction with the merchant affects your prices too, but if you have high charisma it doesn't matter. Me with 200 charisma have same prices at an apprehensive vendor as I do on a warm vendor. For warm/amiable faction it appears that after about 105 charisma that gives you best prices. Apprehensive add 10-20 to that number. After having good charisma for a little while you'll start learning prices and noticing what 'best' price for an item is, so you will know whether you get it or not depending on faction.<br />
<br />
The only item I think on my list that not-everyone has heard of is the Siryn Hair Hood. Not wanting to post spoilers unprovoked, if anyone wants to know where the Siryn Hair Hood can be found, leave a message and I'll post spoilers.<br />

Is there a good enchanters site out there. I have looked but haven't found one that compares to this site for clerics or EQDruids site for druids.<br />

<br />
For Pacifying the mobs. When in a dungeon, our druids harmony becomes useless, so I'm called upon to Pacify (usually not grouped with an enchanter, this is why.) And the higher my Charisma, the better my Pacify works.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traveling Poet</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that was failed to mention, is for the higher level clerics, Ethereal Mist bracers provide 9 CHA each.<br />
<br />
I use the SplitPaw Nacklace and a Crude Stien, but I am loathe to swap out all my equip for CHA cause when you get dressed again, you need to re-med all that mana. So with 1 EM bracer, the necklace and the stien, I am 74 CHA. Not great, but it does drop my cost of peridots from 14.5pp to 12.5pp. 2pp savings each. That really adds up. <br />
<br />
Also, as I understand it, EQ-Casters stated that for pricing, anything over 90cha is wasted, as the prices at 90 cha are the best you can get. If your prices for items are still high at 90 cha, then you need to increase your factions. If this is accurate, then once I get my second EM bracer, a pair of electrun star ruby rings and the crude stien should be all I'll need to carry around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grint Underfoot</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Early on, I got together a bag of goodies that pretties me up a bit. Why a pair of earrings on a dour Dwarf would make anyone think more highly of him I don't know, but if it works...<br />
<br />
Since the equipment doesnt' weigh very much (Crude Stein, pair of Opalline Earrings, Electrum Cat's Eye bracers, Silver Cat's Eye Necklace), and it gets me to just over 75 Charisma, I keep it with me all the time.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take very long to switch out the gear for charisma-based spells (though all the pieces DO happen to correspond to Wisdom items in the same slots...), and it of course helps tremendously over time with merchants.<br />
<br />
I've been thinking of upgrading or adding to this bag o goodies, but have balked at some of the jewelry upgrades because of their cost. But they will pay for themselves in the long run, so...<br />

Amanita! &quot;Charmed&quot;, I'm sure...<br />
<br />
Would you tell an ugly dwarf where that purdy Siryn Hair Hood is? You can e-mail to walbort@hotmail.com if others don't want to hear...<br />
<br />
Maybe then those cute barefoot halfling women will let me buy them a honey mead.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
Turning slightly off-topic though, -the- site for enchanters is Caster's Realm, at eq.castersrealm.com. It is a continuation of the old EQ Enchanters site that turned to all casters, and the main admin is an enchanter himself. Check out both the main board and the 'old enchanter' board - lots of useful info on both.<br />
