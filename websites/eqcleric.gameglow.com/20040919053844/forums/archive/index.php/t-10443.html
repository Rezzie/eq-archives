<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zevrin</div><div class="date">01-19-2000, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently discovered a dervish cutthroat camp in North Ro that's right by the border to Oasis.  And there are only 3 cutthroats there.  If you hit the one on the left or the one in the middle, both of them will pull, however, the one on the right will not.<br />
I haven't experimented with them too much yet, but I can consistently take one out, and almost the other.  And if you can't take it, the zone's only a few steps away.  Also the loot is great.  Bronze weapons.  I would imagine you'd do great if you had a better weapon and you are more geared towards meleeing. However, the higher teens will probably get less experience, if any.  More for 14-16 I would imagine.<br />
<br />
Also, there is usually an abundandt supply of blue shriveled mummies here.  They're pretty good xp, with little hassle.</div></div><hr />

You can pull the ghouls at the ruins as well. Just becareful cause last night I was at the oasis border and ran into a madman caster, nasty.  I died right by the border at night and must of zoned 7 or 8 times before I found my corpse  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif  But good xp still  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
