<br />
The problem at high levels (51+) is that we can't get groups if you're a hybrid or generalist or we have to wait for the cleric and enchanter to log on before we can do anything.<br />
<br />
People will and do make due with what they have in the absense of the &quot;perfect&quot; arrangement. Farming out existing class-specific skills to other classes thus reducing the use of the original classes is not really a viable solution. Players need to learn to adapt to the situation and overcome the obstacles with the resources at hand. <br />

<br />
All priests and some melee have heals<br />
Paladins and necros have ressurection<br />
Other classes have hp/ac buffs<br />
<br />
If you really think about it clerics have NOTHING unique. Its only the fact that we EXCEL at what we do and that makes us worthwhile in a group.<br />
<br />
As for chanters. I really cant speak for them yet. My enchanter twink is only 20 :{<br />

How bout Mark of Karn, the only reverse damage shield in the game?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  And pretty useful too, by all accounts...<br />
<br />
But then, how many classes actually have something unique?  Pallies have LoH and SK's have HT... depending on how you categorize them they could be excelling and not unique.  Let's see... necros have a few things (summon corpse comes to mind)... shapersons can buff stats no other class can (I think  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif)... and let's not forget the monks' cool attacks  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I think uniqueness is a matter of perspective.  Basically, a class can buff, debuff, nuke, heal, melee attack, and defend.  If you think of everything in those terms only a few utility spells are left, and you could probably categorize them too.  But from another point of view, a spell that always completely heals any character is unique.  A casting class able to wear platemail is unique.  Being able to wield neither slashing nor piercing weapons is unique  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  It's all in how you think about it.  How you define 'unique'.<br />

<br />
Necros and SKs have life tap spells that achieve the same effect as &quot;Mark of Karn&quot; (take health from the mob, give to a PC) and do it much more efficiently than our spell since they don't have to be hit to make it work.  Necros can also selectively transfer the life they have tapped to another player.  <br />
<br />
Mark of Karn is little more than a damage shield with an effective 20 point damage rate (take 10 from the mob and give it to you).  It doesn't even compare favorably with Druid (Shield of Blades - 32) or Mage (Cadeau of Flame - 33) damage shields at the same level in total damage output.<br />
<br />
The only thing clerics can do better than other classes is our efficiency in healing period.  We are more efficient at healing and that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats it.<br />
<br />
Yes we get slightly more efficient heals at higher levels, or a tad better XP res but 4% difference is not enough to claim full differentation.<br />

You cast it on the mob, then everytime ANYBODY hits the mob, they get healed 10pts.  So it is in no way like the mage and druid damage shields that you cast on PC's where the mob takes damage from hitting them.  From what I've heard it is awsome, particuarlly on melee types that hit very quickly.  I would have to say it's a very unique spell and I'd love to have it.<br />
