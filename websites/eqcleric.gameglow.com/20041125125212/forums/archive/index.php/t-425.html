I levelled to 54 wed night.  Last night I died to an unannounced train.  Back to level 53.  Ressed myself - ding back to level 54.  Was soloing a bit and got a few more kills in.  Medding up and go stuck under somebody -  was sitting in corner and somebody sat on me, and then got trained again.  Died and lost 54 again.  Ressed myself and managed to reding with a tiny sliver of yellow in 54 again.<br />

<br />
But I can relate.  There is nothing better to me than hitting someone with a heal that lets them zone without dying.  That feeling is pretty close to heaven for me.  Even if I get the monster aggro'd on me as a result, and *I* die.<br />
<br />
When I can restore someone's lost level...wow.  That will be nice.<br />
