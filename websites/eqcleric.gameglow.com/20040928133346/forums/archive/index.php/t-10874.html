I wasn't performing that duty, so I can't tell you how it went.  Seemed like it was pretty iffy.<br />
<br />
Ressing cleric was healing and throwing fast buffs.  Some problems I know we had were the mob getting trained onto the newly ressed.  Probably ressing cleric was going out of mana from the heals/buffing, but I couldn't tell you for sure.<br />
<br />
We had about 5 clerics for Velketor.  4 of us were doing timed cheals one was doing battle resses (click-stick). <br />

Yeah we were pretty understaffed.  Still, I was happy we got him below 50%! But I'm still trying to understand the mechanics behind in battle ressing.  Any pointers?</div></div><hr />

By the time the dead tank zones upon death, gets rezzed, and zones back in, at least two minutes or so have passed, and that's on a good connection. And once the tank is alive, he/she still has rez effects to contend with. I find it much easier to make sure the main tank doesn't die, by erring on the side of caution (read: overhealing and wasting mana rather than underhealing and letting the tank die).<br />

It was just too slow to get enough tanks backup up on their feet.  The ressing cleric might've been better utilized as a chealing cleric.</div></div><hr />

A few people _might_ die of course, just due to lag spikes etc. If some warrior dies to, say, Yelinak during the first 30sec yeah definitely res them back in, but if you need to dedicate a cleric for the ressing duty, then you are definitely taking the wrong approach... Some people even set up res stations. This option obviously works to some degree (I guess), but is commonly known as res rushing and definitely not a very solid tactic.<br />

<br />
Full heals on main tank, thats it.<br />
<br />
Btw, 4 healers is cutting it short. We had 5 today for velk and barely won with 30 people... and thats after some practice. Get at least 6+ to start.<br />

But if you find yourself having to rez multiple people all through it, it's time to rework either your strategy or your groups.<br />
