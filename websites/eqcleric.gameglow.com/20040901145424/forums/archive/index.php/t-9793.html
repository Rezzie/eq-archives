My coment is this: &quot;BITE ME!!!!&quot;. I'm part of a small rp guild on RZ, one with around 20 people in it. Now, granted, I'm not yet at a level for the planes or to reach the dragons, but when I get to those levels, I WILL GO where ever my skills and or group mates can take me. If I and my group wish to go to fear, we will not stay away because some &quot;ubber&quot; guild is there. Granted, we may not get any kills, but we might. No, we will not go to cause trains, and we will try and find people with exp to go with us and show us the ropes, but all these post about having to have an invite to go has finally started to fray me around the edges. I will not sacrifice RPing for some planes run (I'm an officer in this all dark race guild...we do not group/trade/or associate with pale skins) which means my chances for an invite I will accept is slim. Oh well, I just wanted to vent about all the post I have read about not going somewhere because some other players would not invite you...of course, on RZ if the give you alot of static.....kill them, or die trying  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

The planes are unlike any Norrathian zone, and uninvited guests can and do cause everyone in the zone to die. <br />

After all, there was a point in time when noone had been to any planes.  The first people to try undoubtedy had to learn how to do it by trial and effort, with many deaths.<br />
<br />
But now noone else can try it themselves?  Come on, if there's already a group in there, then yeah, I can see your point, but if noone's there, why not try it?<br />
<br />
Just seems like an &quot;Old Boys' Group&quot; to me...  &quot;You haven't done this before, so we won't let you try.&quot;<br />

Beh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raanyar</div><div class="date">02-18-2000, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I absolutely agree with you. If no one is there then it is fair game for anyone to try. It is not about permission to do the zone, it's about common courtesy of not barging in on an established camp. If it were possible to just zone in safely and go take a corner opposite from the established group, then it wouldn't be such a big deal. But the planes were designed not to allow this. Everyone in the plane must work together. It should be pointed out that the plane of air was not designed this way, and after expansion should allow several large groups to occupy simultaneously. <br />
<br />
My real point was, don't rant about stuff that you only have hearsay knowledge. There is not always a sinister reason behind guild actions in EQ.<br />

<br />
Just try to barge in with a group, unplanned into Fear or Hate.<br />
<br />
In Hate, you'll most like set a train that will get all people currently in the zone killed as you madly try to get to the safe corner.<br />
<br />
In Fear you will most like wind up aggroing multiple MOBs and chances are Draco and Cazic as well.  You'll cause your entire party to die, as well as many of the people that are already in the zone.<br />
<br />
Sky is different.<br />
<br />
In either the Hate or Fear scenario, I would not, at that point, expect people that are IN the zone to help you recover your corpses and you may just lose them unless you get a Necro to summon the corpse for you.<br />
<br />
The planes are different.  Its not OWNING a whole zone.  Its a carefully enacted plan that leads to the clearing of the zone.  Bugs in the plan come when people pull stunts like barging in.<br />
<br />
Ever have a monk or necro (or any other class for that matter), run up  with an entire train on their heals?  Right INTO your party?  Think about that scenario...but to the Nth degree.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvane</div><div class="date">02-21-2000, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tkith knows the planes well...listen to him.  No one says you can't go to a plane when it's not being hunted.  But when a group is in the plane then wandering in is a TERRIBLE idea.  Hate is impossible because there are really only 2 places people hunt from in there.  In fear if you just wander in and a full spawn is there you will get smacked down as soon as you zone in.  If you agro and train stuff to the people in there then I can guarentee you won't get help with CR.  Until a plane zone is somewhat cleared it's all about having 24-36 people huddled in a little spot trying to stay out of agro range of EVERYTHING while a monk pulls one or two mobs at a time.  20 people would have a REAL hard time in any plane and if you get more than 2 mobs on you, all 20 will die or have to evac.<br />
<br />
Unless you've been to a plane, you have no clue what hunting in one is like.  And most servers have an organized rotation on planes because of this.  When ya'll get high enough, just get in the rotation like everyone else...but please don't wander in a plane uninvited if people are already there...that could get your whole guild blacklisted for any help anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">02-28-2000, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well now there si some exaggeration. <br />
<br />
Hate can have two groups of 30 hunting in there easily. The more powerful guild should have no problems camping some other spots than the sw corner and let the weaker one hang around in the much safer corner. <br />
<br />
Fear is definitely different. The agro radius is bloody huge and once you agro something you don't see it'll come with a great many friends. If we are breaking fear anyone entering through the portal gets some major negative faction hits with me, and if he dies then good riddance, he can come get his corpse when the place is broken.<br />
<br />
Another problem is that people zone in to fear after it has been broken to kill the respawns (which are naturally way easier). This is also something than can be frowned upon, since these people don't really deserve the equipment (they might not have ANY idea how to really break it, they just wait for others to do it and then leech).<br />
<br />
As for 20 not being enough. If you have those 20 online sure it's enough. Maybe not for boss mobs, but I've killed 3 mobs at a time with 12 on fear and fear has been broken quite often with less than 3 groups on Rodcet. Just be really, really sure what you're doing before you enter PoF. If you go in without knowing anything about the zone and it being fully spawned, you'll be risking losing equipment and will probably have a 6h+ CR.<br />
