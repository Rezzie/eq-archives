</FONT><HR>I'm the guild leader of a modest 50+ guild on Cazic Thule. We currently have about 20 members and I'm hoping to grow to about 30-40 in the near future. Prior to this guild, I was in 3 others, all of which I had incredible fun in, and made many long-lasting friendships. All of the split up, and now several good good friends of mine from these guilds are wanderring around guildless.<P>So I Target the 60 warriors first, and ask what their plans are. All of them reply similarly with I'm joining Uberguild "B". I ask why and they tell me, "I spent all this time getting to 60, and now I need to do the big raids." Uh-huh. So I start asking the others, all over 55, what their plans are...<BR>and I get "I'm joining Uberguild A, B, C, or D."(currently I'd say there are four guilds on CT that are above the rest, no I won't name them)<P>/sigh<P>Does nobody enjoy the little pleasures in life? The friends and the adventure? I may only be in a minor league guild but I still do someting new every week. and the things I've done for 3-4 mos now aren't that old, and I haven't seen every kind of loot drop, and I'm not fully equipped to want to proceed too far too fast.<P>Why do people need to beat the game thats unbeatable? Does anyone think they're gonna kill UberMob X and get a "Coongratulations, you Win!" Message? It seems to me that if you join an uberguild, and take out al the tough stuff and get everything done... Well, then what? All of these guys are the same ones who say, " I'm bored with Kael, I'm bored with Velks, I'm bored with blah blah blah." Do they think that TOV won't get boring? Or the Ssraa temple? <P>I don't want to go trudging off into the end game until I want to end the game. And if you're that tired of EQ just friggin quit. I'm feeling so left out when people say they're moving on to bigger and better things when I think what I'm doing is fun enough. Yes I want to see end-game bosses and such... but that can come later, slowly, when I'm ready. <P>Why does everyone else want to beat themselves up and leave all their friends behind just to see a boss mob, die to it, and not get any loot thats going to senior guild members?<P>I miss em all. <BR>/em sits in the corner rememberring better days<P>------------------<BR>Bolgor Brellwrath<BR>57 Dwarven Cleric of Brell Serillis<BR>Guild Leader of United Forsaken<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I am following a similar thread on the Defender's of the Realm web-site.  They have a member that wants to join an UberGuild, and it discusses how everyone is handling it.  Makes for a pretty interesting read.<BR> <A HREF="http://dor.proboards2.com/index.cgi?pbuser=dor&board=general&action=display&num=1011198611" TARGET=_blank>http://dor.proboards2.com/index.cgi?pbuser=dor&board=general&action=display&num=1011198611</A> <P>This (Piikaa)is my only character and I have been active in a small guild with mid-level players.  I really like the fact that we are more of a "help each other out" club, than a bunch of regimented soldiers, out to kill the best and brightest MOB's VI can build.  I think it is more challenging and rewarding to be able to play solo or join a random pick-up group when I feel like playing.  I also like the fact that we also will group up and go somewhere (place and purpose trips) as a group of guild members.<P>I played RPG's for many years and this game is the closest I have found to the fun and interaction that I enjoyed from D&D.  I admit, when I joined the guild, I thought I would hang out until I was ready for a 50+ guild invite.  Now, I think I will really enjoy giving back to others in my guild when I reach that higher level.  There are more rewarding aspects to this game than just getting more plat & some "great weapon".<P>Piikaa Fishweed<BR>31st Drunken Dwarven Battlecleric of Brell<BR>(Proud member of Twilight Order)<BR>Bertoxxulous Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>EQ's open way of playing allows people of very differnt motivations and styles of enjoy playing the same game.  Why shouldn't the appeal of big mob's and phat lewt draw some people?  <P>If your not ready, then enjoy what it is you enjoy... other people are always going to do what it is they enjoy.  If you don't plan on raiding, then size of guild is un-important.<P>If what you want is to lead a sizeable force of raiders, start by doing what you can... plane's raids, epics, DN, WW, Kael, Thurg whatever you can handle and invite outsider's around level 54-56.  Every place I mentioned can be done with a small amount of people, and outsider's will want to join when they see you do raid/get good stuff.<P>The high end game lacks good leaders more then good players.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Badany, that is NOT a small guild by any measure.  Our guild has about 30 regulars, so if we have a raid where 4 groups turn up, we are happy.  Having said that, we raid HoT regularly, we've started doing the NToV mobs (only the easy guys).  Admittedly with 2 groups of friends we did Vindi the other day.  And I think you guys have a far more formidable guild than us.<P>Size is not everything in EQ.  Unless you want to Zerg everything, 4 groups of high level, reasonably well equipped people who know what they're doing, will do a lot more than 7 groups of idiots.  I know, I've been on both types of raids.... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>What irks me is...<P>When a guild gets called a zergling guild because they do everything in high numbers, but the reality is that they do everything in high numbers because they enjoy each others company.  My guild is the largest guild on Tholuxe member-wise (157 members last count).  When we do like kael arena mobs to stock up on some armor, or something, we have 30-35 people.  Sure, we can do it single-group np, but no one really wants to.  Would prefer to have the company of the entire guild with us to condradulate everyone on victory.<P>Why would I be considered zergling, and why would anyone care anyway?  Not like it affects them.<P>Aladain<p>[This message has been edited by Aladain (edited 01-18-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I wouldn't call that zerging them.<P>Personally it I would consider zerging a mob when doing a mob or set of mobs requires that many people.  When I was in kael the other day there was a guild of about 40 in there gathering armor and not one of them was over 52.  They had multiple whipouts and very little chance for individual armor.  They required the presence of everyone there in order to even remain a viable force.<P>I don't think this is bad but it does fall under the category of zerging something.  When you bring 40 people to a mob where only 6 are needed you really just have observers or an overabundance of bodies.<P>I do agree it is fun and the most fun I have is when we have a large portion of my guild together talking and beating stuff down.  Fun aside, the problem comes in when a guild that is incapable of successfully downing a mob decides to rely on numbers instead of skill, levels, or tactics.  This is when bad stuff happens.<P>When you see a large number of 46 to 50s tagging along with a few 50+ in HoT there can only be trouble and a CR to follow.<p>[This message has been edited by Feias (edited 01-18-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Bolgor-<P>Actually I just went through what you described. I was part of a smaller "family" type guild on Innoruuk.<P>Eventually - I became one of the highest level members of the guild. I attempted to steer the guild towards bigger and better things but my efforts were constantly shot down.<P>"We don't want to force anyone to do anything in this guild. We will get to ToV eventually." I was told.<P>Unfortunately - that is not the case. Unless you work towards it, you WONT get their eventually. Higher level players in the guild will become restless and bored. They will want to explore more areas and defeat bigger monsters... isnt that why they became powerful?<P>Who they heck wants to stay in Sebilis their whole career?<P>So I finally made the decision to leave. Now.. I havent run off an joined an "uber guild" but I have joined a guild that is taking bigger mobs and learning their way around. (Velketor, Vindicator, etc).<P>It all boils down to play style. For some people EQ is just a game, and for some it is more of a hobby. For me... its a hobby.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Piikaa, I just went through the 2 pages of posts that of the message board about Hlaan leaving your guild. I was sad to say the least. Why you ask? Because he was guilt tripped into staying in the guild instead of allowed to leave on good terms and find out for himself what it was he wanted. Had he gone out and found that maybe this wasn't the best decision and asked to be reinstated as a member of your guild, this would be a different story. <P>Uber is but a word, I believe. It is not a level or place you reach after doing items 1 through 12 on a chart. I have been in an uber guild, I have been in a small guild. The difference and the inevitable reason *I* left my small guild at the time was because I was burnt out of being an officer through 2 merges and also I was raiding all the time outside of my guild. Why not help set up raids for my guild? Because I would, and no one would show up for them. It gets to be a little disheartening after a while and one tends to let the matter lie as is and not try and change people set in their ways.<P>The "Uber" guilds aren't always the bullies and push overs people paint them out to be. Through jealousy and misunderstanding do stories get told and passed around like idle gossip from pick up groups to guilds. After a while, it gets to be this image that people expect of the said "uber" guild. /shrug Be that as it may, not everyone is a saint; we all have our flaws (and bad apples in the barrel). <P>A lot of us have been playing this game for nearly three years. I have only been playing this game for two. Sure friends are a joy to have in your guild. Friends also don't have to wear the same guild tag in order to stay friends. (Which is why sometimes I wish my friends lists were larger so i could keep tabs on some of em hehehe). <P>After a while there is only so much you can do in this game. You can help other people obtain items, levels, etc. but sooner or later you're going to want to do something for *you*. It's that darned humanity factor. For a lot of people it's seeing high level encounters, it's seeing new zones that you were previously unable to see (NToV comes to mind), it's experiencing what being part of a team of people doing things with strats you never thought would work, being part of a large machine that is working towards a common goal of defeating an imposing and awesome force. <P>You have to look and see what type of guild you are. Are you a raiding guild? Are you a guild that plans workshops on the best methods of going about certain tradeskills? For every person there is a different directive and motivation about why they chose their classes and how they play this game the way they do. That's what makes this game such a success because it has a little bit of everything for everyone. <P>Your goal and/or task is going to have to be attracting the types of players you would like. If you say that you are a "friend-type guild that raids"... you're going to have to raid. And gauge it according to the responses you get. That is how you will succeed. <P>And Bolgor, you said you targeted 60 warriors first. Warriors and melees are VERY gear/weapons oriented people. They want to constantly improve what they have (well, doesn't everyone to a certain extent?). By joining a "uber" guild they will have effectively taken the next step to achieve that goal. Keep that in mind when they politely decline your invitation to join your guild. <P>Okay I think I'm done rambling now :P<P>*edit* Okay I just re-read this and I'm coming across a little harshly. =\ Not the way I intended it, so please don't read too much into it.<P>Spawrhawk Wormwood<BR>59 Templar of Fennin Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Spawrhawk (edited 01-28-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well Spawrhawk-I gotta agree with you. When we lost our first couple people to the server uber guild, there was "a great wailing and gnashing of teeth", so to speak.<P>Then we all pretty much realized that if yer not happy playing the game how you are now, why the hell are you still paying your $10/mo to be here?<P>So now, when we lose someone, they get a "good luck, enjoy the ride, do what makes you happy".<P>And everyone is alot happier. Oh, and we've gotten to the point where we can start doing some of those uber mobs, even without the people we lost. Last two server Woushi kills were by my guild, Talendor down, Ixiblat is basically a pick-up raid, triggered Trak, Chardok Queen (WOW-that's a nasty pull), Lodizal, HoT, we're bored of the planes (as a guild, some sickos like me still like to go-hehe-pick up planar raids are good for bumping the blood pressure), VS/Phinny are a nessicary evil etc etc. Just trying to say, just because you lose that "OMG key member", you will survive, you will move on, you will grow. Tell them good luck, enjoy the game, and be sure to say hi.<P>Cause in the end, its about playing the game for fun and seeing your friends do the same, no matter what guild tag is above their head.<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 53rd Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??)

</FONT><HR>Well, for any of you who were upset at the way I voiced my opinions and that I should realize that people play differently and want to do different things so don't go knocking uberguilds blah blah blah... Well Duh. Of course I was being harsh. this is a friggin RANT. heheheh<P>Well, that out of the way... I was looking at some of the folks that turned me down in favor of the bigger guilds, and though they have gotten some armor and weapon upgrades, I hear more about their grumbles than their graces.<P>They went from being main tank to 6th string damage dealer, or that every piece of super-sweet TOVN armor goes to someone who's been in the guild for 3 years and is already far more superiorly equipped than them. Again I say, "Well,DUH". The folks I'm disgruntled over are the ones who think they'll join the server's biggest guild and be their new superhero. <P>In my guild a level 60 warrior would be a godsend, in another guild, they're just the 10th level 60 warrior whos the most poorly equipped and least experienced. Same goes for a 55+ mage or a 60 epic rogue. I'd love to have these guys... Uberguilds have enough of em already.<P>Recently one of the larger guilds on CT offered me an invite on some of their higher level raids as they are short on clerics and could use the help. I told them I'd love to, and we started going over raid procedure and so on until they got to telling me how I'd need to temp tag in their guild for the raid. End of story. <P>As you can tell from my sig I am a guild leader. I offerred the option to my guild, if they wanted me to go, and learn so that I could bring the info back to them, and they responded as I hoped they would with a resounding unanimous No. This means I won't be seeing ToVN, or Sraa temple for a while. but I'll always have a group of guys who would follow me to the ends of the earth (or moon) for some fun and adventure.<P>Last night we did some WW dragons for the first time. The loot was sparse. The death toll was high. But not a single person who went wasn't cheering and exstatic when we left. We had a 60 warrior from the server's most powerful guild join us to guide us and show us the ropes, and by the end of the night, he was asking us about our future raids and when the next time he could join us would be.<P>There is fun in this game. And its not exclusive to uberguilds.<P>------------------<BR>Bolgor Brellwrath<BR>57 Dwarven Cleric of Brell Serillis<BR>Guild Leader of United Forsaken<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
