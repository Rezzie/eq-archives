<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orby</div><div class="date">07-02-2000, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its been a long time since i used my atone spell..and its sat in the back of my spell book since the 30's.  I used to use it when i was soloing in sol b, cause if i pulled more than one mob, i could root one, back up some, root the other, then move and atone the first, so i was able to fight mobs pretty much solo even if pacify didnt work.  <br />
   What i didnt realize, is what a great mem blur it is!  Last night my group was doing charrassis, and if u have ever grouped with a chanter vs. a summoning mob, u know how annoying it can be for them to get summoned every 5 seconds after slowing the mob...often using up 50 percent of ur mana to keep them healed.  Chanters have several mem blurs, but their best ones cost 350 mana and rarely works.  I think once an enchanter wastes 350 mana trying to blur the mob only to find out it doesnt work, they would just asoon waste our mana getting beat up then try again.  Well anyways i loaded up atone and cast it on every mob he mezzed, and it worked amazingly, i would cast it again if he got summoned from trying to slow the mob and i would say it instantly deagroed him 8/10 times, at 60 mana this was easy for me to cast, and the 2/10 times it didnt work i just cast again no worries.   After that I was sold on Atone, i started casting everytime the druid and myself agroed as well with stunning success.       Im not sure if this strategy will work for everyone, all these mobs were blue to me, mostly around 44-54 max, but from now on i will definately keep a slot reserved for the spell!<br />

<br />
I was unaware that their mem blur cost so much, and if ours is just as effective...<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suriya</div><div class="date">07-02-2000, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, ok so when did you cast the spell exactly?  This sounds like a valuable strategy...but when exactly did you find it most effective?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyion</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atone is in the front of my spellbook.<br />
<br />
It is especially useful after your Enchanter does Theft of Thought after Mez, or when a MOB wont aggro off a caster. Simply Sound of Force or root it, then Atone. usually this will wipe it and it will leave the caster alone. Cast it either after Theft, mez, or during a fight when a mob wont aggro and you have time. The downside is Atone takes a bit to cast, so isnt effective without Mez, Sound or Root.<br />
<br />
I use Atone when I travel, also, since its  a great spell for not training greens to a zone.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in seeing how Wake of Tranquility works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ming</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Be careful with this spell. It can also get your casters killed. The problem arises when the mobs are dotted and get blurred. The first tick they take damage they're immediately agro on the caster who dotted them, and will run to the caster. In typical caster fashion, the caster will then run away with mob in tow. Tick two....mob takes more damage and caster is still running around. The tanks will try to reagro, but once this cycle is started its hard for them to reaquire themselves on the hate list. So be warned..atone is nice, but be careful if you have dot casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElMoMo</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little while ago I posted a message titled Atone 101, asking for pointers on this fantastic spell.<br />
<br />
I must say in Frontier mountains I keep it memmed. I often Park (thanks to all here who showed me this absolute GEM of a tactic) then atone the mobs. Why? If the root breaks I dont want that guy bashin on me noggin. Sure let the melee's go get it once done and ready for it. Also pull that nasty caster out of range root and atone it. I love seeing a wizzy hit my tank for 400dd and my tank tear it down in seconds. Why? because we where ready for it, knew where it was, and I was already casting Sup Heal when he engaged.<br />
<br />
Also, have you had that blood frenzied mob not break off your ranger, or enchanter, or rogue and you keep dumping heals into them. Why not have the BF'd player stop attacks, atone it, and the tanks become mob enemy number 1.<br />
<br />
I love atone. Its saved my butt, my parties butt and I have it on page 2 in me spellbook.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolant@Tunare</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently acquired Water Sprinkler of the Forgiven (cleric only 2HB 11/24, unlimited Atone by right-click).<br />
<br />
I equip it when there's no enchanter in the group and use Root/Atone for pseudo-mez. It seems that casting time is longer than the real spell, but having no recast delay compensates it. The downside is that this is 2HB and usable only when equipped (not activatable in inventory slot like JBoots).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanar</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted the info onto my guild board about the atone trick.<br />
<br />
It appears that it would be a superb thing to do in the planes.  The enchanters I spoke to said that the info was spot-on<br />
<br />
Just find out who the enchanters are beforehand so that you can create /assist hotkeys for them.<br />
<br />
If a mob engages the enchanter, hit the appropriate assist key and cast that atone.<br />
<br />
If you save the life of the enchanter like this, the life expectancy of everyone else will rise.<br />
<br />
I will be trying this tactic on Fear (if I am able to go with my guild this weekend) and see what happens.  I believe this would be a great mana saver for the enchanter, so he/she can buff more people and mes more mobs.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows if this tactic works, please let me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orby</div><div class="date">07-04-2000, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been using it regularly now for the last three days, trying to figure out the best strategy for when to use it etc...There are two instances that will cause great agro to the rest of ur group and drain you of healing mana because of it:<br />
<br />
1st) Chanter slows mob: almost always an instant agro. At first i was just watching for the slowed msg, but after 10 mins i can figure out the chanters pace and cast atone before i even see the slow msg...Instant deaggro if successfull.<br />
<br />
2nd) Druid ensnares mob:  This isnt always such a big deal, but if the druid is resisted it almost always agroes hard on the druid.  The good thing is about the same time the Chanter is slowing, the druid is snaring...Druids are always happy that they can finally sit down and med during the fight  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Perhaps others have been using this method, i dunno, but to me it has completely changed how i play a cleric...Once u get into the cycle of doing this on all mobs that attack ur non tanks, u will see just how much mana u are saving from healing them...Alot of people complain that warrior taunt is not usefull at higher lvls...But the truth of the matter is it works fine, it simply cant outtaunt most spell casters...This is where Atone becomes godly.  The only reason i ever went down to half mana in a nice group of six in OS was because of buffing...Every bit of my mana went to chealing the tank and a couple spot heals to the other members, and of course the 60mana atones..<br />
ATONE! learn it! love it! live by it!<br />
