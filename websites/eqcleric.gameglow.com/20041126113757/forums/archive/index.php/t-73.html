My previous character was a shaman so I know a bit about how  to keep a group healed... Just to get some misconceptions out of the way and  so please don't laugh too hard  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  <br />
    I had the impression that cleric on the earlier levels (&lt; 10) can do some melee but as times goes on (&gt; 20) you would not want to melee... One the the things I noticed was there are lull spells which I'm not used to. Up to now, it was easy to solo but I'm beginning to see that I have to group soon. I wanted to get to level 7 before attempting to  group at Crushbone. Then probably stay there  until 12. Move to Unrest for a few levels(mostly lawn trash) and then move to Oasis... and about 20 come back to unrest until 24 and then go to Cazule Thule.  Now as you tell most of this comes from what I think would do as  a shaman. Is this a reasonable plan or is there another route that is more perferable.</div></div><hr />

Once you hit 17, it seems like everything is either green or red (and red DW crocs are not nice).  I'd run over to EK/SK/LR at 17 and start smacking things in that area til 22 or so, then move to CT.  Once I hit 28, I moved to LGuk liveside (had a really good group).<br />
<br />
As far as the Lull series go, I'm less than no help.. I think I've memmed a spell from that series maybe 3 times in over a year, and had it fail *every single time* I tried to use it.<br />
<br />
You don't say what race you are, and what weapon you are using, so advice on melee is a little tough.  On my baby DE cleric (level 17!), I use a summoned hammer and melee when mana is greater than 80%.  I'm planning to give up melee for the most part once I'm level 20 or so, but it could continue to be viable if you have a fast weapon, good skill, and high strength for a while longer.  Mostly it depends on the 5 W's, as who you fight, where you fight, when you sit to med, what you fight with, and who you're grouped with (hah!  I did get 5 w's!) makes a big difference in tactics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medtakk</div><div class="date">06-03-2000, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh heh, Im a dwarf cleric....  I had a few pieces of small bronze armor so I figured a dwarf was the way to go... Besides I like that it is near BB and CrushBone (good newbie areas) I want to start to group as early as possible.<br />
<br />
  IMO the best clerics are those that literally sit on their butts alot. So I plan to do that when I start grouping... I can't imagine me meleeing for much longer so unfortunately my 1HB and 2HB skills are for not (or am I mistaken)<br />
<br />
One of the things I was not sure of was is there any cleric above 30 that solos alot and how did they do it? It would be great if I can somehow keep my 1HB or 2HB up to date so to speak..<br />
<br />
Of course this is much in the future so I was  wondering if its worth the trouble to invest so much time  developing melee skills when you're primary skill in a group is keeping everyone alive...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still melee at certain times when things are calm and no threat of death. There are times when you're group is simply overmatched for the mobs and you could be pulling 3 instead of one. At your level you could be standing right next to the warriors as your melee is not much worse than theirs. They can taunt, so the chances of you aggroing the mob is slight. During the battle if healing is required, then it's time to decide whether to sit and med or finish off the mob. Yes, later in life you will be out of the melee loop for entire levels at a time, but for now enjoy it.<br />
<br />
As for our lull, calm, pacify line of spells.... I would say worthless. Wait, maybe they're worse than worthless as more often than not the spell is resisted and the whole camp comes and quick death can result. Best to rely on the Ranger or Druids harmony line or a Chanter with mezz.<br />
<br />
We have to make many judgement calls during our careers. Some may even involve who lives and who dies for the better of the group. It can be stressful at times, but its the rewards of success and chance of failure that gets my adrenaline flowing like no other class and I've played most of them. http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  <br />
<br />
Soloing is fun (less stressful) and you can be successful at every level. You just have to pick and choose your targets. Our spells are more efficient against undead, but we can kill live stuff and level up without support.<br />
<br />
To level fast stay grouped. Preferrably with good company who's main goal is to keep you free from damage. Let them know early that when you say &quot;ON ME&quot;, it means you are now occupied by a mob and heals are no longer guarranteed and medding is impossible. A good group will dispatch help, a bad one will ignore you. If you can root and park that mob, fine, but it's always an easier battle if you can just be left alone for the most part. Your nukes can be resisted, but I've never seen a groupmate resist a heal. So with that in mind our mana can be 100% efficient.<br />
<br />
This board is full of experience players that helped me tremendously when I first started my cleric. Our class really stands out a little later in life, but the rewards are worth it. So have fun and stick with it. <br />
