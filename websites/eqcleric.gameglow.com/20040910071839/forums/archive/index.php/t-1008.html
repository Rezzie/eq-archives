<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaal</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone. This is my first post on this board. First off I'd like to say that being a cleric is truly fun. I've only been playing for a little over a month, and I experienced a situation recently that I can't seem to get out of my mind. I was hoping to look for some guidance from some of the more traveled clerics in the game. I was in a pickup group hunting yard trash in Unrest. The group consisted of a bard, enchanter, magician, druid, paladin and myself. Being the a cleric, I figured my role was to heal (imagine that!), well the enchanter (leader of the group) didn't seem to think so. Everytime I join a group I immediately ask what they want me to primarily do (ie. heal, melee and nuke, whatever). I am leery about joining groups, because I would feel terrible if I were the cause of someone's death, but such is a cleric's life. Anyway, I asked the typical question on what my job was. The enchanter told me to just heal. Ok. No problem. Well the paladin brought back an unusually large pull (not on purpose though). Everything was fine, we were handling our own ,but I ran out of mana healing. One character was getting close to dying, so I decided to do a combat med to get an emergency heal off. Well, the enchanter was po'd because I was out of mana and not nuking. So i followed orders and used the last bubble to nuke. Well, my nuke did finish off the Jack-o-Lantern, but the bard died. Needless to say, I caught all hell because the bard died (just from the enchanter and the bard). I argued the point about what I was to do, but my attackers wouldn't listen. Things settled down and the bard got his corpse back and everything was well, at least until the next wave of undead. This time I got barked at for not joining the melee (even though I wasn't needed)and just healing. Again the enchanter decides I need a thorough tongue lashing and starts telling me how to play my cleric. Up until this point I was being nice and not trying to cause a conflict, but that didn't seem to help. The magician came to my defense and tried to help me out but the enchanter simply kicked him out of the group. What I did next was very vengeful and I probably shouldn't have done it. The next pull was about 3 skeles and 2 death beetles. Well midway through the battle 2 tormented dead and a ghoul aggrod into the fight. It was then running time. Needless to say people we screaming for heals, and I simply lied and said &quot;out of mana&quot;, and gated to Dagnor's Cauldron. I then disbanded from the group. The enchanter private messaged me and said everyone died, and basically started calling me names and trying to insult me. I promply replied &quot;Lesson learned: Don't anger a cleric you are grouped with&quot; and then /ignore. I know I was probably wrong in doing this. I am normally not a vengeful person, but I feel like I was not being treated fairly.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes, you have to judge whether you would save more people with a nuke or a heal. However, I would have probably left the group before the next pull had taken place.<br />
<br />
In the situation you described, it seem quite apparent that you did the correct thing.<br />
<br />
Your reply to the enchanter was the correct thing to do.  If the enchanter continues playing, (s)he will learn that what you said is correct.  Clerics, generally, are quite hard to annoy - but when they are angry, watch out!<br />
<br />
Players under level 20 don't understand any tactics.  From levels 20 to 35, they are learning what role they really have in the party.<br />
<br />
It seems that this enchanter would have a higher level character - probably a warrior, so he would not realise what decisions a cleric has to make.<br />
<br />
From the tone of your reply, I can read that you were proud to have only 1 character die in the fight.  If you know that is the best you could have done, then you have no case to answer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erzebet</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome, very glad to meet you.  I have found that many people who have played another class to a high level feel that they have knowledge of how to play your class, even if their high level is something else entirely. It is frustrating, and verbal abuse in a game is not worth dealing with.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, instead of disbanding and finding another group, you chose to make the entire group suffer.  Other people in your group died because of your conscious decision to not use your mana to help them.  Reputation in Everquest is very important.  That enchanter's actions are sure to get him excluded from groups in the future.  Be careful that your actions do not do the same. <br />
<br />
In any case, being a cleric is being responsible for the lives of others.  You have to learn to trust your judgements and know that you have the experience and practice to help you determine the right course of action.  People telling you how to play your class will not go away.  Even now at 30, I recently had a monk in my group who told me not to buff him.  When I asked why, he told me he wanted to be able to use a pumice stone to cancel DOT's.  This is not acceptable to me, as monks have very few hitpoints to begin with, and he was the puller.  If he has no buffs, he loses health more quickly, I have to heal more quickly, and I get beat down more quickly.  Not OK.  And I told him so.  If they don't like it, finding another group who can work with a cleric is far less trouble than recovering your corpse afterward.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!<br />

It might just be me, but I would find it disheartening to be in a group where the cleric needs to ask what his/her role is.  As far as that chanter goes, I would have disbanded after the first 1 or 2 comments and left them to their own devices.  I would never have let the other members of a group die on purpose.  To me, that was just wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaal</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I appreciate the feedback and suggestions. I agree that I should not have made others suffer because of an argumet. I know I probably shouldn't ask what I need to do when I join a group. I know what I'm capable of and what the general job is for the cleric, but every group is different (except recurring groups of course!), and therefore play style needs to be adjusted. This I know I can do and do well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aguuth</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At your lvl, with that group I'd of been meleeing and posibly nuking some.  You have a group that is healing intensive with a bard, druid and paladin already, you have an enchanter who should keep the fight to 1 mob at a time, the bard will heal a lot more effeciently than you will, and the paladin has nothing else to do with his mana than to heal between fights.  Also you should all of had breeze for mana regain during fights.<br />
<br />
But in general, they sounded like jerks, I'd of left the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are keeping your party alive and you aren't always OOM, then I'd say you have a good clue how to play a cleric. Forget what they say. Play a cleric the way you have been, and if they threaten to kick you out of the group, then good riddance.<br />
<br />
How long does it take a Cleric in Unrest to find a group? 2.3 seconds. How long does it take a group to find a cleric? a pretty long time sometimes.<br />
<br />
I think that what you did was wrong though. No matter how much of a jerk someone is, you NEVER gate out and leave your party to die like that. An action like that may come back and bite you in the rear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta agree with everyone here. You had every right to leave after being treated so rudely but you don't have the right to just abandon people in mid-battle like that.<br />
<br />
As you level, you'll find yourself more and more dependant on groups to gain exp. And developing a negative reputation won't help you in finding groups. And as confident as Lukee sounds, the simple fact is that it's not always easy to find a pickup group. I personally would rather have no cleric than a cleric who will leave on a whim because having no cleric means I know not to expect a heal so I can plan accordingly. I know many who probably feel the same way.<br />
<br />
I would find those who died and send them tells of apology, even to the rude enchanter. It is the right thing to do, regardless of how your reputation suffers.<br />
<br />
If possible, I wouldtalk to the enchanter as well. Explain your position. Things may not work out in the end but at least you can say you tried.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that clerics are late bloomers. Sorta like that shy guy/girl with the thick glasses and the buck teeth may be tomorrow's gorgeous bombshell. Make a cleric mad and it will often come back to bite them in the rear when, someday, you simply smile and say &quot;Nope. I know my role now and it doesn't include me resing you&quot;  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
My advice is simple but perhaps a big more theoretical than you expected...<br />
<br />
You play your cleirc.<br />
<br />
You play your cleric as you see fit.<br />
<br />
You make your best judgement call and do what you *feel* is right.<br />
<br />
Somtimes others will tell you what to do.  You choose whether to do it or not.  If they say &quot;nuke&quot; then you shoudl respect the request and evaluate the situation to see if nuking is appropriate.  But in the end, you should do what you feel is best for you and your party.<br />

Take their requests as requests and serve as best as you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unrest is one of those &quot;Cleric UN-friendly&quot; Zones. I spent levels 18 - 27ish in Unrest my points:<br />
<br />
*If there is no one mezzing or rooting you do it as you WILL agro the undead fast.<br />
<br />
*At your level of hunting yard stuff for exp, if you have a pull and see 2 MOBS from inside the house join the fray your in trouble.<br />
<br />
* If you think you may have to run, let the group understand that YOU call a run. If you dont think your mana will last, call it early. It may not seem like a long run, but try it with 4 ghouls/Carrion Ghouls on you rooting you. In a good group I stop at the foutains to get heals on those who need it (even with the MOBs on me) It is much better for me to die as I am bound in DC than a poor tank bound 3 zones away.<br />
<br />
* SOW is a much if you can get it.<br />

But way back when I was hunting in unrest, the people I grouped with, still considered it a victory if we beat off a train and lost only one. <br />
<br />
As for leaving the group, I would have left sooner. When the mage got booted, that would ahve been a good time to leave and join with the mage. <br />
<br />
Like others have said, reputation is everything. It's very unlikely, that you will ever restore your &quot;faction&quot; with that enchanter and other group members. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lenia-EMarr</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I join a group, I ask the classes and levels of everyone, to get an idea of the abilities of our group, and figure out who the &quot;targets&quot; will be for my heals. Basically, you will be healing either a tank or enchanter, or both, if you have at least 1 of each. You need to keep the enchanter alive for crowd control as he makes your groups' lives MUCH easier. Also the tank(s) is/are important to keep alive for obvious reasons. If you have any other class that you are constantly healing(ie a &quot;Tank&quot; druid, whatever else), you need to take a step back and figure out what is going wrong. The mobs should always be attacking the tank(s) in an ideal situation, with the enchanter mezzing and only 1 mob attacking at once. I personally do not like Monk pullers because of their low hp, but thats my opinion. If a nuker burns out(ie spends all their mana on nuking), and my mana is low, I tell them that the tank/enchie is priority in healing. Sounds to me like the enchanter wanted to run everything and thought he/she knew it all. It also sounds like the puller may have been pulling too much, which happens alot in Unrest, due to weird pathing(imho) and yardtrash. In any event, as the cleric, you are the one who see's the whole situation. You see how many hp everyone has, how many mobs are left, how much mana you have left, are the casters oom, etc...Thus you should be the one to call evac(running) if you dont think you can make it out of the situation safely. Also, dont let a tank pull without asking for a mana report. I've run into alot of tanks(and alot of them seem to be trolls for some reason?) that dont wait for mana to be sufficient, which will eventually kill the party. Make them wait for you to be ready hehe. They dont like it sometimes, but they will do it by god  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Ok, I've written enough. I would have explained the situation to the group and probably left after the first lip from the enchanter, but I wouldnt have let the whole party die on purpose. Thats not good. They will all remember that for a long time and one of them may remember your name when looking for a cleric for the next planes raid.<br />

In most cases I assume my normal cleric role of healing and buffing.  If I have the mana to spare, I'll nuke, stun, whatever, as I see fit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sobe</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey all,<br />
Couple of things I would like to point out:<br />
<br />
First: a real quick (off topic) response about monk pullers, they are the premier pullers at higher levels, others can and will do it but in places of multiple mob pulls, the feign death - taggin method is a no brainer. HEHE if not cheap in Verant's eyes.<br />
<br />
Second: I'm not sure if you just forgot to state this in you story or you don't do it.  FM, 80, 60, 40 ,20 OOM - updates on mana during a battle is important, and give the whole group a better understanding of the healing situation.  Having both the paladin, and druid in your party allows for more healing resources which should be utilized anytime under 30% mana (differs from time to time).  <br />
<br />
Third: Ties into number 2 - Don't feel shy to ask for others to heal when low on mana.  And what happened to the Paladin's Lay hands to save the bard.<br />
<br />
Fourth: The use of DD in my eyes are two fold: Will bringing the mob down faster be more mana effecient than healing?  Example Ghoul Wizards in Lower GUK.... I kill them fast and furious.  The other is finishing off a creature low on hp, to keep it from running or causing more damage to my group.<br />
<br />
Fifth:  Screw Them!  As stated before clerics generally find groups very easy.  If a group is abusive to you.... leave with a smile.<br />
<br />

I think Veloran had the timing for leaving the group right. It was a poor decision I think to leave them in that situation, especially in that method; it makes you look bad to everyone else in the group, and word of mouth spreads quickly.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
However, it was also inexcusable for the enchanter to berate you for doing your job properly. Your DD spells are not mana efficient (even the undead ones aren't terrific), your mana is much more useful keeping the group downtime low. As was mentioned, the 'chanter should have been laying down cover fire for the group with stuns and mez, obviously (s)he was not very strong on what (s)he was supposed to be doing as well.<br />

<br />
Caleal is right! I have said that very thing before. Example:<br />
Group; cleric, enchanter, ranger, necro, sk, warrior. Nice mix of classes imo! are pulling the frenzied area in lower guk. I'm never under %20 mana and atoning the mez'ed mobs so the enchanter and I are syncing up great. Then the  &quot;I need to taunt&quot; ranger chimes in after an hour or so about me waiting much too long to heal. I asked what his hit pionts where? 2K he says.I replied  complete heal is 400 mana, superior is 250 mana for 700 hp .....do the math.<br />
<br />
WEll I dont Like it he stammered. Doesnt anyone in this group hear me!!! At this piont I was about ready to get nasty but pulled back a bit...<br />
<br />
I have been here  for 4 hours you have been here around an hour has anyone died yet? I asked. No, but thats not the piont! was his chirp. <br />
<br />
Shortly there after a cleric friend of his showed up and sat in the corner buffing him and keeping him healed.....get this with greater HEAL....2k hp with greater ROFL!! <br />
<br />
He left the group and I stayed composed. <br />
<br />
Hobbit warrior today pulled the classic ....heal ......uMMM HEAL NOW! Ordeal I calmly reminded him that CH is a 10 second cast and I do try to keep the party alive. he shut up after that ). Still irritated me a little that some casters twinkie warrior is telling me when to heal but whatever.<br />

<br />
I don't want to rehash what everyone has been saying but yes, that sounds like a bad situation, but gating out on them was a bad thing to do, and something you will have to live with now.<br />
<br />
Ahh well, as they say we live and we learn. <br />
<br />
I have learned to simply leave in a bad situation. I love being a cleric and i take my job seriously. If i don't think i can do my job because of certain conditions in that group, whether it being someone refusing buffs, or telling me to do something totally assinine, then i excuse myself, disband, and move on. <br />
<br />
But the only advice i feel is apropriate for you is, just do what YOU feel is neccessary. Afterall, it's your character, and you chose to be a cleric because you liked it for one reason or another. Do what you feel is right.<br />

Each situation is different.  Your conscience will dictate how well you performed.  Learn from each encounter and bring it with you to the next. <br />
<br />
The best way to manage a group's healing is watch what happens for a couple of battles against single mobs.  Whenever I join a group, I run a checklist:<br />
<br />
Ask for classes/levels<br />
Buff everyone with HP and AC buffs<br />
Ask the groupmates how many HPs they have after buffs<br />
<br />
You know how much mana you have - break out your calculator and do a little math.   You will have a good feel for how much one of your heals will improve their health bars, be it at level 10 or level 48. You also have a good sense for how much damage the group can take before you start saying &quot;low on mana&quot;.  <br />
<br />
If my group is in a particularly nasty area, then I ask the puller to grab single mobs for starters.  I like to see who taunts the best and how badly they can take a beating.  Then, with this &quot;simulator&quot; information, I know who's life bar needs to watched carefully.   I do not stun, nuke, root or atone during these first few battles.  I just heal. It's not creative and borders on boring, but you get a good sense for the group's &quot;synergy&quot; and ability to absorb damage.<br />
<br />
After a few battles like that, we begin in earnest - pulling the nastier critters in one, twos and threes.  And it's at this point that you can begin to use YOUR style of play.  Don't ask the group what they want you to do.  They will be wrong every time.  Here are some helpful reasons why:<br />
<br />
<br />
When deciding between a final nuke or heal to win a battle, remember that heals are NEVER EVER resisted. (yup.. that happened to me.. tried to nuke a ghoul to finish a battle.. he resisted.. two died.  Lesson learned.)<br />
<br />
Communicate with your group.  Let them know your mana state at each bubble (80%, 60%...) all the way down to 30% (my Low on Mana - LOM - trigger). <br />
 <br />
Stunning is usually better than nuking - its far cheaper and if done right, can render a foe nearly inert.<br />
<br />
Stunning also acts as damage prevention and is MUCH cheaper than healing - using several stuns in a row to prevent damage uses FAR less mana than healing an unstunned MOB's target.<br />
<br />
If you have a secondary healer in the group, let them throw a heal or two while you med up a bit. <br />
<br />
As the cleric, never, ever throw a big heal on the puller if he's returning wounded.  Let the support healers (pally's especially) each throw a small heal into him to keep him alive.  If YOU do a big heal, YOU will aggro each incoming mob and YOU will die, followed shortly by each of your groupmates.  (If the high level tank TRULY knows what he's doing and cannot shake the massive pull train he's formed, he'll stop and die alone - instead of risking the lives of all party members.  At higher levels, this is a common tactic as the 90% XP rezzes make death a non-issue for most.)<br />
<br />
If you are nuking, like other casting classes, wait until the critter is below 50% to start throwing the big bombs around.  Otherwise, the MOB will aggro YOU and let you know how appreciative he is about the damage you have been dealing.<br />
<br />
Don't be afraid to take a few shots.  Sometimes, taking a little bit of a beating from one MOB while the rest of your team kills the other MOB is a sound tactic.  (We are a plate-wearing class for a reason.  No, we don't have the hitpoints of tanks, but we sure as heck can take a beating with the best of them.)  You just have to trust that your group can kill the first one before the MOB's buddy kills you. &lt;grin&gt;<br />
<br />
Make a hotkey that alerts the group that you have made the decision to ZONE.  Make sure it's easy to read.  And in that same hotkey, let the zone know that your group has screwed the pooch and is now dragging an Amtrak to the zone.   If people stay behind after the cleric has called for a ZONE, then it is their mistake.  We are the lifeblood of the group and the BEST judges of what can and can't be done.<br />
<br />
Cautious clerics live a LOT longer than impatient ones - dead clerics can't heal.  Stay alive.  If you are in a situation where you think some poop may hit the fan, let the group know that you are in a purely defensive mode (no nuking... just stuns, roots, heals, fear, etc) and work SMART.<br />
<br />
You are the group's backbone.  Stay cool and stay calm and you will NEVER have an unenjoyable time in Everquest.<br />
