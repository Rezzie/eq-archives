<blockquote>
<font size=2>*Spell Changes and Additions* <br><br>- A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath. <br><br>- Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves. <br><br>- Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available in the game. May your quest for such spells be successful. <br><br>*Item Changes* <br><br>- Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves. After a fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water effects from these items. They have been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves). <br><br>- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the waist. <br><br>- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate. <br><br>- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate. <br><br>*Bug Fixes* <br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location. <br><br>- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16. <br><br>- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging. <br><br>- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals. <br><br>- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home. <br><br>*Enhancements* <br><br>- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild. Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete. /guildd now has a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild. <br><br>- Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle effects. This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons... <br><br>- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages. This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the client. This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better performance and connectivity. <br><br>- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones. They will also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through. Any of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two. <br><br>- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window. This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys. <br><br>- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method. <br><br>- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed. First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it. At the same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it. <br><br>- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is using the proper ingredients. Failure of the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent. <br><br>- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window. You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade. <br><br>- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be surpressed. <br><br>*Quest* <br><br>Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you. <br><br>- The EverQuest Team <br></font></blockquote></p>

<br>                        General Changes<br><br>                             Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200.  <br>                             Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on others once casted upon yourself. <br>                             The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by SKs <br>                             Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via /book or alt+b. <br>                             Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race. <br>                             New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One on Antonica and two others on Kunark.<br>                             NPCs at these locations can fill you in on the details. Good hunting. <br>                             The casting time for four cleric breastplates sporting the 'Celestial Healing' effect has been increased to one<br>                             minute. We understand that this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently discussing alternate<br>                             effects to place on those items in the next patch. We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that<br>                             could be placed and kept on the group tank. When we've decided on the new affect, it will be applied to those<br>                             items retroactively.  <br>                             Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for skill values over 100. Values under 100 still<br>                             show the qualitative identifiers. <br>                             Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other players. You can now turn on or off your<br>                             ability to inspect other players by typing /inspect.  <br>                             Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over the chat window. <br>                             Fixed 'Breath of the Sea'. It was mistakenly set to be unresistable. <br>                             Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current zone. This is a necessary step to ensure<br>                             that you are removed from all hatelists and clean up your pet. <br>                             'Voice Graft' will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of your pet. <br>                             You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged. <br>                             The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125. It was the intent for druids to be better at tracking than<br>                             they were, however before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered better. With the tracking<br>                             improvements from the last patch, this increase was appropriate. <br>                             Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing. <br><br>                        NPC AI Adjustments<br><br>                             Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65.<br>                             Previously, players could only taunt creatures below their level. <br>                             NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small amount of hate when they see you cast<br>                             beneficial spells on their enemies. Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do this. This is<br>                             why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez. <br>                             Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much 'temporary hate' when a player would sit down in front of<br>                             them. <br>                             The maximum amount of 'hate' that an NPC can add when witnessing a heal to targets above level 50 has been<br>                             decreased substantially. <br>                             Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the number of hitpoints healed. Previously,<br>                             healing one hitpoint would cause one point of hate. Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points of hate. <br><br>                        Velious Music<br><br>                             Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood music for some Velious Zones.

<blockquote>
                        Source: EverQuest Patch Message.<br><br>                        Today's patch contains a wide variety of enhancements and changes. Due to the number of changes being<br>                        made, this list is primarily a summary. Extended descriptions of the changes and the reasoning behind them can<br>                        be solicited on the EverQuest Message Boards.<br><br>                        Spell and Skill Changes<br><br>                        Druids, Shaman, and Clerics:<br><br>                             Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids.  <br>                             Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles) <br>                             New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for clerics. <br>                             New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch. <br>                             Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and Torpor. This will allow them to stack<br>                             with all other spells, save spells of the same type (Heal over time). Prior to this, all heal-over-time spells<br>                             followed the same rules as regeneration spells. <br>                             Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy. <br>                             Lowered recast time on Wake of Karana <br><br>                        Paladins:<br><br>                             Added Endure Magic spell at level 30 <br>                             Added Resist Magic at 55 <br>                             Moved Guard spell from 49 to 39 <br>                             Moved Armor of Faith from 53 to 49 <br>                             Added New level 53 paladin spell: Divine Glory <br>                             Added New level 59 spell: Celestial Cleansing  <br>                             Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br>                             Added Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced. <br><br>                        Shadowknights:<br><br>                             Removed artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells. Please note that post-50 lifetap<br>                             spells never had an inflated mana cost. <br>                             Moved Spirit Tap to level 55 <br>                             Moved Drain Spirit to level 57 <br>                             Added Drain Soul at level 60 <br>                             Grim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced <br>                             Moved Shieldskin to level 34 <br>                             Pet buff added at 29 <br>                             Added Diamondskin spell at 59 <br>                             Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors <br>                             Due to the recent improvements to "Harmtouch", it is doing much more damage than it would before and<br>                             unbalances PvP. As such it will now do less damage in PvP (68% of PvE, down from 80%). In addition,<br>                             Shadowknights on the PvP servers were routinely killing themselves via non-XP losing means and<br>                             attacking other players with Harmtouch immediately upon respawn. In order to address this situation,<br>                             Harmtouch is no longer automatically "recharged" by death on the PvP Servers. <br>                             The "Lifeleech" discipline now increases hit probability in addition to its other effects. <br><br>                        Rangers:<br><br>                             Added Endure Cold at 22 <br>                             Added Skin Like Nature at 59 <br>                             Added FireFist at 22 <br>                             Moved Bramblecoat from 49 to 39 <br>                             Added Spikecoat at 49 <br>                             Added resist cold at 55 <br>                             Added Panic Animal at 22 <br>                             Moved Jolt to 51 <br>                             Moved Spirt of Wolf from 39 to 30 <br>                             Added Cinder Jolt (fire-based Jolt spell) at 55. <br>                             Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors <br>                             Added See Invisible at 39 <br><br>                        Bards:<br><br>                             Added new level 20 Bard Song: Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity <br>                             Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors <br>                             Changed it so that the bard spell Denon's Desperate Dirge to increase damge by 10pts per level over 45.<br>                             Also made it so the spell does 20% more damage using the Puretone discipline. <br><br>                        Magicians:<br><br>                             Added new level 59 spell: Valiant Companion <br>                             Added new level 39 spell: Summon Companion <br>                             Rain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities they can damage (all rain spells) <br>                             Added level 29 spell for Mages: Expedience <br><br>                        Enchanters: <br><br>                             Lowered recast time on Visions of Grandeur <br><br>                        Bug Fixes<br><br>                             Aggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed. Before they would only affect damage taken and<br>                             not affect damage dealt out. Now they affect both as designed. <br>                             Fixed the bug with going to the spellbook when the inventory window was up in fullview mode. It should<br>                             work now. Also, fixed a minor bug where if you were in normal mode and tried to go to the spellbook from<br>                             inventory via /book or the keymapped key it would not go, and it would make the done button not work<br>                             properly for the inventory mode. <br>                             Fixed NPC melee ranges to be the same as for player characters. In other words, if you can hit the NPC,<br>                             he can hit you. This bug was a problem with one dragon that could be hit, but could not hit back. <br>                             Fixed a bug that made it impossible to "Call of the Hero" someone out of water or lava. <br>                             Fixed the proc on the Chilled Scythe. Owners of this item will need to swap it out with a GM. <br>                             The Kromzek Surveyor Scope now fits in the "Ranged" slot rather than the "Ammo" slot as before. <br>                             Fixed a bug that caused the two single-target bard snare songs to break too soon in some cases. <br>                             Fixed a bug whereby NPCs would consider the race of a player prior to the loading of the faction table<br>                             upon zoning or logging in. This would cause people to be attacked by things that normally like them.  <br>                             Players should now be properly removed from the group regardless of how they exit the game. <br><br>                        Misc Changes<br><br>                             Added text labels to the fullview inventory window "body" slots (Available only to Velious Subscribers) <br>                             Added the ability to toggle those labels on and off. Use /invwinlabels [on/off] (or no arguments to toggle).<br>                             This is saved in the eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section with the key InvWinLabels=[TRUE/FALSE] <br>                             Increased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors. <br>                             Pickpocket now works to a max of 5 levels below you, or level 45...whichever is greater... You can<br>                             pickpocket NPC up to level 55 if you are level 60.  <br>                             The mouse pointer will now move at a multiple of its normal speed when you adjust the<br>                             MousePointerSpeedMod setting in the eqclient.ini file. You can set that multiple on-the-fly with the<br>                             /mousespeed command. <br>                             The "AutoHelp" feature that can be set under the options menu has been enhanced. Spell casters in<br>                             particular might want to turn it on and try depressing the ALT key. It's perfect for refreshing your memory in<br>                             regards to your spell lineup. <br>                             If you are interrupted while trying to cast a spell that uses a component, you will no longer use that<br>                             component. Jewelers should be very pleased with this change. <br>                             Reduced the casting difficulty (fizzle rate) of all spells over level 56. Spells have always previously been<br>                             set up so that it's usually more efficient to use a spell from a previous circle than the current one. The<br>                             formula did not take into account the fact that everyone stops at 60. <br>                             Changed it so that players will now lose experience when they die in the Arena in Kael Drakkel. It seems<br>                             that people were fighting giants in that arena in order to avoid the death penalty. <br>                             Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3 hours instead of 3<br>                             minutes. <br>                             Avatar and Focus of Spirit should now stack <br>                             Raised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, druids, and shaman. <br><br>                        Item Changes<br><br>                             The effect on the "Frost Giant Beard" can now be used at 35th level rather than level 50. <br>                             The Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag.  <br>                             Iksar can now use the Ashenbone Shield <br>                             Chandged Crystallized Shadow leggings to rentable <br>                             Changed Gorilla Hide Leggings to show up as leather, was cloth before <br>                             Changed Envy from a piercing weapon to a shield so players could Bash with it. Envy is a parrying<br>                             dagger. <br>                             The Shralok Pack is now LORE. It was set to pending-lore some time ago. <br>                             The Guardian and Sentry Armor bracers are no longer LORE. <br>                             Donal's Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target once every 7.5 minutes. This<br>                             addresses some of the balance issues that became apparent given the existence of a mana-free<br>                             complete heal. <br><br>                        Trades and Crafts<br><br>                             Fixed the Gator Roll baking recipe. <br>                             Repaired the notetext instructions for creating a Mixing Bowl with pottery. Repaired Holgresh Fur Cap and<br>                             Holgresh Fur Moccasins tailoring recipes. <br>                             Made it so that the file is returned in addition to the hammer when a character fails to forge any of the<br>                             various chain jointings. <br>                             Repaired Recipe for Enchanted Tier`Dal Adamantite Bracelet <br>                             Made it so that the Dwarven Smithy Hammer is returned on a failure to forge Brellium Chain Jointing. <br>                             Repaired Field Plate Boots smithing recipe <br>                             Changed the name of the smithed Enchanted Cabilis Scale armor to Imbued Cabilis Scale armor for<br>                             naming convention reasons. <br>                             Repaired the recipe for converting 3 Enchanted Large Adamantite Bricks into 1 Enchanted Block of<br>                             Adamantite in the Tier`Dal Forge, it was previously only possible in the Oggok Forge. <br>                             Made it so that the Bread Tin is returned upon a failure to bake bread. <br>                             Mithril and Velium Bonings will be stackable. <br>                             Mithril Studs will be stackable. <br><br>                        NPC AI - Hate<br><br>                        We've made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section dealing with target-selection, or what's<br>                        commonly referred to as "Hate". It is not so much that NPCs react differently to hate now than before, but that<br>                        we've changed the way that hate is awarded. <br><br>                             We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc. Due to the high proc rates at upper levels,<br>                             the amount of hate generated from procs, and the spells that were selected for those procs, made<br>                             keeping the attention of the creature much too easy a task for the tank. Simply, it nearly eliminated the<br>                             challenge of keeping a foes attention at levels above 50. <br>                             We've capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most casters, specifically for debuff-type spells<br>                             like the Malo and Tash series. The hate calculation for these spells takes into account the number of<br>                             hitpoints of the NPC and did not "play nice" with the increased HP limit of Velious. It explains why<br>                             Enchanters, for instance, would complain that casting a Tash spell would lead to near-instant death. <br>                             We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the<br>                             high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than greater<br>                             heal. In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial.<br>                             Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed.<br>                             Due to our desire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two separate caps have been<br>                             placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or above. Heal spells will generate significantly less hate for<br>                             targets below level 51 than those at or above that level. <br>                             We've also re-evaluated ways that players have to reduce their own hate. While spells in place to allow<br>                             this are OK, the Evade skill (possessed by rogues) let them out of their damage too easily. A rogue that<br>                             successfully evaded would immediately drop to a level of hate lower than someone who was in the<br>                             awareness range, but hadn't done anything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its foe.<br>                             This problem was exacerbated by the increase of the size of the hate list implemented with Velious.  <br><br>                        Tracking<br><br>                        Tracking now works in full view for all classes that can use it, and sports a nifty scroll bar that allows players to<br>                        see everything on the list. In addition, the /trackplayer setting is now saved to the eqclient.ini file.<br><br>                        The following options have been put in for Rangers only:<br><br>                        /tracksort  <br>                        /trackfilter <br><br>                        /tracksort options beginning with R are reverse order<br><br>                        Hybrid Casting<br><br>                        Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher levels. The casting times of their spells<br>                        went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per second went up. This results is having to take longer to<br>                        cast spells, and losing more damage/second for each second taken in casting. <br><br>                        To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times<br>                        greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6%<br>                        at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells. <br><br>Information found at <a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">EQ Casters Realm</a><br></blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
January 9th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>We're happy to present today's patch, which focuses primarily on addressing issues that have been brought forth by EverQuest players.  We appreciate the opportunity to spend some time focusing on specific issues important to you.  Today's patch includes the following:<br><br>*Disciplines*<ul><br><li>The "Resistant" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 1.</li><br><li> The "Holy Forge" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 2.</li><br><li> The "Weaponshield" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.</li><br><li> The "Leechcurse" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.</li><br><li> The "Deftdance" Discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.</li><br><li> The "Puretone" Discipline now lasts 4 minutes instead of the previous 2.</li><br><li> The "Sanctification" discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.</li><br><li> The "Unholy Aura" Discipline now gives a 50% bonus to Harmtouch (compared with the previous 25%) and causes it to save versus disease, which should result in even fewer resists in most high-level encounters.</li></ul><br><br>*Spells*<ul><br><li> "Lay on Hands" has been improved starting at 40th level.</li><br><li> The "Summon Corpse" spell is now available to Shadowknights.</li><br><li> Corrected a bug that was causing damage while using the "Trueshot" Discipline to be the same regardless of the quality of your bow.</li><br><li> The spells "Focus of Spirit" and "Visions of Grandeur" now stack.</li><br><li> "Harmtouch" is now resisted as if it were a "Lifetap" spell, meaning that it is all-or-nothing, and nearly unresistable with exception to encounters that are immune to magic or out of the acceptable level range.  In addition, maximum damage for Harmtouch has been increased starting at 40th level.</li><br><li> We fixed a bug that caused "Lure" type spells (Wizards) to be resisted more than they should have been in certain types of encounters.</li><br><li> Melee attack timers will no longer be reset when a SK, Paladin, or Ranger cast a spell.  Previously these classes had to wait a full attack delay after casting before they would attack via melee again. </li></ul><br><br>*Miscellaneous*<ul><br><br><li> You may now adjust the clipping plane in the Hole.  Previously, the clipping plane was fixed.  Many people requested the ability to bring the clipping plane closer to allow them to improve their client's performance.</li><br><li> Fixed several problems with trade-skill components that were not dropping.  Also added some new recipes.</li><br><li> Fixed the Iksar "Shackle of Steel" quest.  </li><br><li> The additional options for /camp (/camp server, /camp desktop) have been implemented.  /camp server will take you to the server-selection screen.  /camp desktop will cause EverQuest to terminate and take you to the desktop.</li></ul><br><br>*Root and Snare*<br><br>Root-type spells and "snare" type spells now use a separate spell effect.  <br><br>Previously, "Root" spells would overwrite any snare effect upon the target.  When the root would wear off, the target began moving at full speed.  With this change, when root wears off, snare will still be in effect.  This has a few added effects on the other end.  <br><br>For instance, root will no longer cancel SoW or Journeyman's Boots effects.  It also allowed us to correct a long-standing bug that was allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's Accelerando if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was rooted.  As mentioned in a previous patch where the first part of this bug was fixed, this was not the intended effect.<br><br>*Looting NODROP Items*<br><br>A new command is now available to EverQuest players.  <br><br>In order to prevent the accidental looting of NODROP items, the /lootnodrop command has been added to the client.  The command supports three options:  ALWAYS (Default) - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP item.  SOMETIMES - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP items that your race and/or class cannot use.  NEVER - NODROP items will be looted without confirmation. <br><br>It is highly recommended that you DO NOT CHANGE this from the default option, as the GM staff cannot assist in cases of accidental looting.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
I personally think it was a joint plot between Gameglow and my wife.  Gameglow wants updates, and my wife is out of town and is enjoying my not being able to play.  Ok, maybe they had nothing to do with it, so while browsing I came across our new Velious spells.  They are:<br><ul><li>Armor of Protection, Level 34, Self only AC/Hitpoint buff (+15 AC, +225 hit points, 110 mana)</li><li>Turning of the Unnatural, Level 39, DOT vs Undead (400dmg, 180 mana)</li><br><li>Celestial Healing, Level 44, short duration (4 ticks) group regen (744 healed, 200 mana)</li><br><li>Improved Invisibility to Undead, Level 50, Fixed duration ITU (10 min, 75 mana)</li><br><li>Word of Stunning, Level 55, AE Stun (low radius, low resist, 9 second duration, 150 mana, 45 sec recast)</li><br><li>Aegolism, Level 60, upgrade to Heroism, group HP/AC buff (1100 hps, 54 AC, 900 mana, 1 peridot)</li></ul><br><br>I have to admit that I'm pretty excited about a few of those spells.  Aegolism is the best answer I've seen to why a Cleric wants to hit level 60.  It's a group Heroism/Marzin rolled into one.  And with Marzin stacking with it a level 60 Cleric can add 1800 hit points to group members.  1800!!!  That, my friends, is a LOT of hit points.<br><br>Word of Stunning is another very nice spell.  Ever find yourself or your group surrounded by a lot of mobs and wondering what you would do once your Div wore off?  Slap a stun on the lot of them.  Also gives us another tool when the Wizards and Enchanters decide to play "nuke em all."  A specialized spell to be sure, but one that I think will find some use.<br> <br>I remember feeling a bit of chagrin when I saw that Wizards were getting ITU.  Then I saw what ours does.  Wizards can have our castoff.  This makes our spell the best invis in the game, albeit ITU isn't used too much (alas).  Still, there are places that are strictly undead (e.g. deep in the Hole).  It's somewhat comforting that in those rare situations where I'll need to toss it I'll know it will work.<br><br>Group Celestial Heal and Turning of the Unnatural are the last two new spells.  Group Celestial Heal has an incredible HPs healed/Mana ratio (3.72:1).  Granted it's over 24 seconds, but it still has the best ratio available to Group Complete Heal.  It's another nice tool.  Turning of the Unnatural is the only spell I find a bit dissappointing.  It's ratio is only marginally better than Expel and it takes 96 seconds for its full effect to be reached.  I'm not sure why I would use this spell instead of casting Expel twice.<br><br>And finally, Armor of Protection.  A buff just for me =).  See, Verant knew I was getting close to 1k AC and wanted to help me out.  As a bonus all the other Clerics get it too.  Ok, dementia aside another 15AC/225 hit points is great.<br><br>Of course, these spells are not final and may change before (and after) Scars of Velious is released.<br><br>Regardless, I'm looking forward to our new spells.  Aegolism is enough to spur me to 60.</blockquote></p>
