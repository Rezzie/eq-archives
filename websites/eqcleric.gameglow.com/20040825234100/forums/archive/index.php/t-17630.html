<br />
With the introduction of server transfers with gear Divine Legend (http://www.divinelegend.com) are accepting cross-server applications from Clerics and Druids.<br />
<br />
We were the 4th guild in Elemental planes on Terris and 1 of 2 high end Euro guilds on the server.<br />
<br />
We are currently going through a stage of re-gearing people in Vex Thall (VT key an advantage but not required) and also re-flagging before we push through more Elemental content after losing some longterm players to retirement etc.<br />
<br />
If you like high end raiding and can raid 3 times a week on Euro times then we would welcome your application. We wont demand you online 24/7 as we are an adult guild and acknowledge that peoples education, jobs and families all come before slaying pixels. <br />
<br />
All we ask is that you are mature in your attitude and are willing to work as a team.<br />
<br />
Be safe.</div></div><hr />
