DEFINATELY NOT an EverQuest killer.<br />

Having lots of fun, didnt log onto EQ all weekend either. But that being said, there is an end in sight. Sure once im done i can play it again with increased difficulty and/or different party make-ups. But it will lose its &quot;enchantment&quot; quickly and move to the shelf along side countless before him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimette</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had our usual Friday-Sunday games weekend. About 10 people turned up to play some Airfreighted Diablo II.<br />
<br />
I stopped playing about 9pm Friday<br />
Clem stopped playing about 10pm Friday<br />
<br />
My verdict : Suffers from Baldurs Gate syndrome:<br />
<br />
Great Single player<br />
Poor Multiplayer for more then 2 or 3 people at once. <br />
<br />
Especially with a few Necromancers, the game with 8 people just gets silly. Clem (normally plays a monk) was playing a Necromancer with 6 skeletons, 2 casting skeletons and a golem. Every 5 minutes he would go 'Hey, I found a dungeon. I'm off to solo it'<br />
<br />
We ended up hitting him a lot.<br />

It's great fun, but I'm not sure I'd play it online - the chat interface is clunky and messages are gone fast.<br />
<br />
I got a necro up to low teens, and it was great fun having mage pets, skeletons and golems running about, although the lack of /pet commands was frustrating. Pets just attack the nearest thing to them, as far as I can tell. Necros sure do seem powerful though, when I took a break for a bit my friends complained that things were a lot tougher.<br />
<br />
Fun game, but I think it's more suited to LAN play, whereas EQ is better at large multiplayer scale.<br />

In fact, I would have been extremely surprised if it was. It does, however, cut into EQ. I have seen a drop-off in the number of people playing EQ during prime time. It's not a big one, but it is there. <br />
<br />
Diablo 2 proves what I have suspected all along: many people are playing EQ simply because there is nothing better around. Shadowbane is the most likely EQ killer IF they don't treat us like Verant does.<br />
<br />
As for D2 problems... yeah, the necro is overpowered... but not invincible  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif Another thing that's annoying is that weapons and armor aren't indestructible like in EQ so you'll spend a LOT on repairs for good weapons (my dual wielding barbarian already does). If the chat is too fast for you there is a chat log you can bring up.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp...<br />

<br />
I would be very suprised if any MMOLRPG can treat 200,000+ customers any better (if they charge $10/month) than Verant has. Also Shadowbane is a PvP enviroment. Thats one of its major design features. There are many EQ people that do not want to play in such an enviroment. That being said i will probably give it a go. But more than likely it will swiftly become the avid/powergamer type preying on the casual gamer types.</div></div><hr />
