Sure a quarter to a third of them really suck but the good ones more than make for that. I really meeting new people all the time, I've made some really good friends this way. And I've learned how to handle many different situations, I don't think theres a combinations of classes I haven't grouped with. I do agree that you (generally) have better luck getting good groups the higher up in level you go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason xp sucks with guild groups:<br />
<br />
1.  Everytime you have 6 people who can work together someone says, &quot;Wow, we should go to &lt;zone&gt; and kill &lt;mob&gt; for &lt;loot/quest&gt;&quot;.  Then we spend an hour getting to the new zone when someone has to log, and our group falls apart.<br />
<br />
2.  &quot;Gee, we should go raid &lt;zone&gt;&quot;.  So you go from 6 people getting xp to 30 people getting no xp.<br />
<br />
The reason loot sucks in guild groups:<br />
<br />
1.  Need before greed.<br />
<br />
2.  Hand-me-downs expected<br />
<br />
Pickup groups for profit and xp.  Guild groups for fun with friends.<br />

Pickup groups for cash and loot.<br />
However some of my best exp groups have been all guild groups.<br />
Knowing the people and knowing that they can play their class well lets you really push that single group thing.<br />

<br />
I was referring to pickup groups for xp and profit.  Besides, just because people aren't in your guild doesn't mean they're strangers.  I've got hundreds of non-guild friends in Norrath.<br />

<br />
Aside from EM legs and my epic, everything else I own, including all my 55+ spells, came from pickup groups or from trading items won in pickup groups.  It took me 3 fungi tunics to pay for all my spells.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love my guild.  But it's my responsibility to equip myself, not my guild's.<br />

<br />
Surely the best thing about guild groups is that you *can* go NBG and you do get hand me downs and the best thing about pickup groups is that (if agreed) you *can* roll on stuff in order to sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinskey Bab0linskey</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love pick up groups and xp'ing.<br />
<br />
I don't buy anything, so lewt is not a major issue... but I enjoy the fact that pick-up groups are usually quicker to start and Fuz is right... it's very very rare that someone says &quot;Hey, I need to go kill........&quot; and expects you to come help.<br />
<br />
I'll go to my grave wondering how I'm the greedy one if I don't want to go get &quot;you&quot; an item.... it seems more like the other person's being greedy, but that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josiefuz</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">NBG is great, except that most drops are not for clerics.  So in order for me to get better gear, I tend to have to buy it.  In order to buy it, I have to have something worth selling.<br />
<br />
As for hand-me-downs...hmm where to begin...  I currently wear a emerald dragon bp that I bought for 40k.  I currently have about 2k in the bank.  If I won a velious BP on a raid, I'll not be handing down my emerald dragon bp.  Expected or not, forget it.  That 40k will buy me a horse + 2 tink bags + cash in the bank for spells.  That's not greed, that's just economics.<br />
<br />
Now, if I had gotten that dragon bp from a guild raid, then I would definately consider handing it down, because the guild helped earn it.  As it was, I had to spend long hours kicking Fungi arse to raise money to buy it.<br />
<br />
Others may disagree, but this is my stance.<br />
<br />
-Fuz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree totally Fuz...I give nice discounts to guildies who want to buy stuff I bought with my own cash when I get a replacement (and on drops I get in non-guild groups), but I don't give away stuff. If I got a drop during an all (or mostly) guild event, then later get an upgrade (without paying for it outta my own cash), yeah, of course I hand it down, but if it's something I busted my hump to afford, sorry guys, you gotta pay just like I did...<br />

I sometimes give some stuff i win in pickup group to guildies, but it's my choice to sell it or not. We need money too !!<br />
<br />
Of course, guild raid stuff belongs to the guild.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i love pickup groups  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif they allow you to make new friends, even if some groupmates are sometimes not worth beeing know  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
<br />
I won't apply NBG in a pickup group. Josie is also right here : too few cleric drops imho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josiefuz</div><div class="date">12-13-2001, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, I had some hot dice last night!  I was in a pickup group in Maiden's eye and picked up these:<br />
<br />
Medallion of Life (5 str, 50 mana, +5 all resists, no drop)<br />
<br />
Shaded staff (10/22, +5 all resists, 1hb all/all, droppable)<br />
<br />
Shrouded boots (ac 12, all stats +4)<br />
<br />
These dropped over an 8 hour xp grind.  It was a good nite!  The medallion replaced my goblin soul caller I've had for the last 30 levels, the staff is merchant bait but I'll probably sell it to a guildy (usually I sell to guild for half the market price unless I need cash for something), the boots became my feet-swappers with donals for those times when I need the wis/charisma more than ac.<br />
<br />
By the way: 8 hours of straight xp with no deaths and consistantly good groups in maiden's eye = 1.6 blue bubbles /cry.. 59 sucks!<br />
