<br />
Use strike to pull, you get some free damage.  You can also use flash of light to sortof stun the mob a bit.<br />
<br />
divine aura can give you time to run, but it's short and refreshes every 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
don't try to heal yourself midfight; odds are you wont succeed and will lose several rounds where you could have been hitting the mob.<br />
<br />
Train your 1hb if you haven't already, it gets started slowly.<br />
<br />
Guards are your friend.<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy the game!  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
