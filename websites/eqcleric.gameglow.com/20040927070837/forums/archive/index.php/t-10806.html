<br />
This last patch has us a bit stumped, both spawned approximately 30 hours after server reset, and haven't respawned since. (Its been 4 days now).<br />
<br />
Before this last patch, they were both on about 3 days, or 72 hours, which coincides with Ragefire's random spawn timer, 0-72 hours after Nag dies.  We assumed that at least, hard to tell when they reset the server weekly, as you only get one, maybe 2 spawns in that time.<br />
<br />
  If anyone else has been killing these 2, or even one of them for that matter (Zland is +CoV faction) and have noticed a new pattern of spawn times, let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

Verant saw people getting close to getting the 40 people in Sleepers needed to maybe kill 1-2 of the killable warders and got scared so they majorly upgraded the spawn time.   Hope you got a lot of keys while you could...<br />

As it was before, it would take a single guild that was at the power level for sleepers a good 1-3 months to get enough keys to get a good force into sleepers. As more people get to the level, equipment and organization levels to be serious about sleepers they up the time it takes to get enough keys. Not only does it make it take longer, it also causes intense competition for spawns, and all the problems that causes.<br />
<br />
I'm just not sure this &quot;game&quot; is worth the time anymore. For many, if not most, people, it will no longer be worth the time once games like Shadowbane are released. The one I'm looking forward to the most is Dark Age of Camelot though. Think Verant really needs to get a clue and realize that &quot;the Vision(tm) of EverQuest is VERY lacking in appeal compared to some of the soon to be release competitors for the mmporg market...<br />

However, they seem to have forgotten that most of Kunark was hard because people didn't have the levels and equipment to do Venril and Trakanon right away. <br />
<br />
Everything in Velious was killable using only high end Kunark stuff right away. The uber guilds already had the levels and the experience in coordinated assaults, they just needed the strats for the new mobs.<br />
<br />
Verant were just naive in thinking it would take months for players to figure out new strats. <br />
