</FONT><HR>I just spent the weekend in High Keep's Guard Room and watched a level 22 cleric gain aggro on every other multi-mob pull (we had no enchanter, and even though I was level 25/26 they wanted the primary healer role).  So after watching them over-aggro so much I figured I'd come here, vent a little, and get some advice to see if I'm on track.  I just envision that cleric getting killed every multi-pull when they start using Greater Healing.  Now that I'm moving down into the WR of HK, I really need to avoid aggro if at all possible (and maybe other young clerics could use the pointers from y'all).<P>At level 19 we don't have much to work with (although Luclin added a nice heal over time).  And I realize our buffs (symbol, Daring/Bravery take a level or 3 to hit their maximum potential).<P>14) Healing (60m 100h 1.67 ratio)<BR>14) Symbol of Transal (55m 73h 1.33 ratio)<BR>19) Celestial Remedy (190m 260h 1.37 ratio)<BR>19) Daring (60m 115h 1.92 ratio)<P>At level 24, we get 2 upgrades and a new heal.<P>24) Symbol of Ryltan (111m 158h 1.42 ratio)<BR>24) Bravery (70m 140h 2.00 ratio)<BR>24) Greater Healing (150m 300h 2.00 ratio)<P>My tactics (and things I've seen, especially when fighting without an enchanter):<P>1) Don't start healing tanks at 90% health if it's a multi-mob pull.  One of those mobs is going to come over and personally thank you for your efforts (causing chaos while you spam your "ON ME" key and everyone has to stop and come over and taunt it off of ya).  Granted, with only a 100hp heal at your disposal, it will be tough to stay ahead of the mob's damage output if you let the tank get too low, but if you're getting beat on, you'll be doing zero healing (or meditating).<P>2) Get someone to buy that Luclin Celestial Remedy for ya (if you can't get to Shadow Haven yourself).  On a 3-4 mob pull, even without an enchanter, it's almost always possible to drop this on both tanks that are taking damage (I wait until 50-70% health) without gaining aggro.  On a good day, it stops the bleeding (keeping the tank at or above the health level when it landed), on a bad day, it just bought me some time before I have to throw a large aggro heal.  I started using this around level 21 regularly (it's sooo mana intensive), and now at 26 I'll use it up to 3x in a fight.  Best used if you can meditate for the 24 seconds (and gain some mana back).<P>3) Since I'm talking about aggro avoidance, you shouldn't need to worry about AC/Defense/Dodge, but it happens and you should always have Defense/Dodge maxed out every few levels.  Sometimes it's better to trade WIS items for AC items.  The longer you can stand there and take a beating gives the tanks a better chance to taunt the mob off of you.<P>4) Use your Daring/Bravery buffs as spot heals.  If there's a druid in the group, don't let them lay Skin like Steel on the group (it negates your ability to use Daring/Bravery as a low-aggro heal).  Because you're updating a buff, you'll gain a lot less aggro, plus it's mana efficient and keeps a buff up (one less buff you'll have to time).  Wish I had learned this trick before level 26.  Symbols are too expensive to use this way (unless you're a very rich cleric).<P>5) Save some mana for the end of the fight.  This goes along with point #1 about not healing early.  Once you throw a heal, that's it, that mana's gone, nothing you can do if tank 2 (or a caster) suddenly starts dropping like a rock.  My goal is to end the fight with 20-40% mana and all my group at or above 40% health.  (Tanks fight just as well at 40% health as at 100% health.)  In fact, towards the end of a long fight, I'll actually start using smaller heals and buff updates so that I can "touch up" the maximum number of people if things are still touch and go.  And as long as I have mana, we can handle that spawn that likes to pop on top of us right after we finish a close fight.<P>6) Save Greater Healing for single-mob encounters, or for when low-aggro tactics just aren't going to cut it.  Hopefully by the time I have to drop a GHeal, the tanks have generated enough aggro on all the mobs.  But GHeal is something I now reserve for when the tank hits 40% health (and Celestial Remedy and Bravery can't stop the bleeding, or I need to drop enough health on the tank to keep them alive long enough to drop a heal on another player).  Anytime there are multiple mobs, odds are high that I will gain aggro from the GHeal.<P>7) Don't fight back if you gain aggro (and don't run around like a dress wearing caster, you're allowed to wear plate armor for a reason).  It'll prevent the enchanter from being able to mez the mob (in fact if there's an enchanter, tanks should probably stay on the primary target while the cleric/enchanter use stun/root/mez).  Stun it, root it, and scoot out of range if you have to.  Besides, if you get too low of health, you can always Divine Aura to buy the tanks 18 seconds.<P>Now, what other tactics are there?  (Or is there something wrong with these tactics?)<P>------------------<BR>Corish, 26 Cleric<BR>Morrel-Thule, Avatars of the Ancients</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Don't try to do all the healing and buffing for the group yourself, unless you have to.  At your level, a druid (or a shaman) is still a pretty decent healer, and should be allowed exercise that ability.  If you work with the secondary healer you should, through teamwork, be able to sustain a faster pull rate for the entire group, which will in turn both reduce your aggro and reduce the number of multi-mob pulls you get in the first place.<P>Not trying to rant or flame, but your post was all about "How can I do it all myself?" and you even went so far as to exclude the druid from assisting you in one respect.

</FONT><HR>Eek, my bad, not really the way I meant it (good of you to smack me down for it).<P>I like it when a druid/shaman/paladin/ranger is on the ball with heals (in fact the druid that night was good about keeping me alive when I did get paid a visit by a beastie).  <P>Does recasting SLS act as a low aggro heal as well?  (I expect that it's nowhere near as mana efficient for the druid to play it that way as our Daring/Bravery line.)<P>I'm at that awkward level where a Druid's Skin like Steel has more AC but less HP than my Daring/Bravery line (so it overwrites our buffs).  But a level 29 druid's group SLS is pretty nice and mana efficient (250 for a full group instead of my 420 mana for Bravery).  The downside (and why I request that druids not use SLS when the cleric is using Daring/Bravery) is that it removes away a low-aggro 120-150 pt heal from my quiver.<P>------------------<BR>Corish, 26 Cleric<BR>Morrel-Thule, Avatars of the Ancients</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Bravery is a much better buff than Skin Like Steel, actually, and there's no point in comparing Skin Like Steel to Daring since both Skin Like Steel and Bravery are level 24 buffs.  So unless the druid is using the group version of Skin Like Steel, there's no disputing that the cleric buffs are better.<P>All the priest HP/AC buffs, including shaman buffs, can be used as heals.  At low levels they're sometimes very mana efficient (Shaman's Inner Fire comes to mind), but they don't stay that way.  The real problem with using them as heals at low levels is that they're not time efficient.  <P>The aggro aspect is something I hadn't really considered, but I have my doubts you'll be using them that way much longer.  A smaller heal works well in that area.  At level 51 I can chain cast Superior Heal (my new heal for this level, woot!) until my mana bar is empty and not gain aggro.  And sometimes I do just that in order to insure that there's still a target there for the cleric's CH to land on when it finally resolves.<P> - Chronomis<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Heroic bond is probably the best group heal I currently have, especially for AoE fights where everyone is dropping at pretty much the same, steady rate, plus it removes me having to keep up with that buff if I use at as a heal as well. And the next to nothing agro from it is a godsend. (Cast a group heal on a multi-mob pull and watch the agro /shudder). And Valor off my Donal's arms is awesome for small groups hunting faction/pharming (where the mobs are low enough to not present a major problem, but high enough to cause some damage) or for soloing (200HP mana free heal is amazing in the right situation). Most clerics in the 50s aren't going to have those smaller heals memmed-the space can be much better used by a stun or root to help with crowd control.<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 52nd Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??)

</FONT><HR>Not all mobs react the same to heals.  I spent several levels in HK and cazic around those levels.  Multiple mob heal aggro was something I had to deal.  <P>Really depends more on the mobs then anything else IMO.  I have gotten heal aggro from healing myself on more than one occasion.  Mob on tank, I heal myself, mob attacks me.  With an unmezzed mob, nothing is keeping it on the tank unless he is taunting both.  Time for root park.<P>I have never gotten heal aggro on kobolds in velks, whether it was 2 or 3 mobs unmessed running free pounding on a tank I just chealed.  Buffing a tank returning with  kobold has earned me whacked on more than one occasion.  So buffs do get aggro. <P>I advise using the new dot heal if you are having problems with unmezzed adds aggroing.  My heal aggro management is subconscious.  I died so much from heal aggro eventually my brain learned how to heal without my knowledge.  <P><P>------------------<BR>Baroness Kornaena D'Lez<BR>Dark Elven High Priestess<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000593&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000593&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
