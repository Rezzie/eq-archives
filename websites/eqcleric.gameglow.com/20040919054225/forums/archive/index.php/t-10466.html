Bind at the barb fishing village just down the river.  If the Farmer starts babbling about a swarm coming gate to the village and wait for the Swarm Mother and Swarmlings to spawn and clear out, I usually gave 5 or 10 minutes.  If you see any bails of hay laying around (they'll look like little baggies, like a dropped item) take them to the miller lady.  Her house is the one at the East edge of the field but like all of the Millers she wanders around a lot.  Just use Sense Undead to track the crows and your best Undead nuke and pretty quick soloable levelling.</div></div><hr />
