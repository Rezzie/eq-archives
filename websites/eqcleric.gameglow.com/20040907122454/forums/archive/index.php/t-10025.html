<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clenzz</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a discussion on my guilds private msg board ATM.  I made a post and thought it would also be suited for posting here.  Here's is a copy of it.  Seeing the current posts both here and at the glade, I thought it's a good time to get some of these things off of my chest.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I've played a druid to 50. then another druid to 58. and 3rd a cleric to 60 (well a necro to 53, a monk to 60, a pally to 56, a shaman, a war, and a few others to complete the list). <br />
<br />
<br />
I can say this. <br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics have CH. CH is over powered. we all know that. But forget about CH for a second. Druids are almost the same healers as clerics. Bekken brings up a good point about DA. but as far as heals go, almost the same. Clerics get a few situational heals that druids dont (group). and CE is better than natures recovery because of time(almost the same hps). But other than that, druids heal just like clerics. What i mean to say is, they're JUST behind us clerics in heals. <br />
<br />
Now, druids also get forage, DSs, Ports, group ports, a pet(lol), Dots, quad spells, snare, atk buffs, str buffs, regen(a heal cleric doesnt get), evacs, debuffs, charms, pet buffs with haste, more weapon types, dire charm (=P), great nukes. Druids can solo with the best of them. Druids can quad kite. Druids up to 50 OWN clerics(very important when talking class balance). <br />
<br />
Almost everything listed there is GREAT for soloing or exp groups. Clerics realistically dont get any of that. if you take away CH(rumored to happen in POP), the druids &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clerics. If you give CH to druids, druids &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clerics. <br />
<br />
However, i must say, a viable postion must be found for druids on raids. Druids may own clerics outside of raids, but druids need a job to do on raids other than backup healers, and backup nukers. This reason is why i quit my druid, Kireol. <br />
<br />
In summary. Druids need raid potential, and clerics need better exp group/soloing ability. <br />
<br />
Things i would like to see clerics get in POP: <br />
-------------------------------------------------- <br />
AA skill to crit up to 5,000 damage vs undead like pallys get to, but with spells, on our best undead nuke <br />
Improved Undead nuke (725 just dont cut it) <br />
Improved Undead DOT(a 750 DOT that only works on undead is our best? ROFL) <br />
Self only invis AA skill <br />
fast heal for around 1500 hps. long repop(20 secs) <br />
Upped melee = to 3/4 of what a pally can do.(we should be medding or healing, but would be nice to be able to melee once in a while. (The current 1/10th of a paladin is just unacceptable) <br />
AA skill of AOE Manaburn CH(AOE CH that uses all mana) <br />
Improved resurection. maybe spell cast with no rez effects, with 98% rez.(you wouldnt use this much, because of mana cost, but to have it would be nice) <br />
Lastly, a cana, or gather mana would just be SWEET, but this one is dreaming here. <br />
<br />
Those are my thoughts after playing both classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeist</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">druids need a job to do on raids other than backup healers, and backup nukers.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Must every class have a very specific and important job to do on a raid? Druids are jacks-of-all-trades. It is no different on raids. They do multiple things that others do better. It is a trade-off they made long ago to be able to do so many things.<br />
<br />
It cracks me up when classes that have so much going for them complain about not having a specific job on raids. I'm a 60 cleric and sometimes I do backup heals on raids. If I could nuke as well as backup heal, I'd be freaking ecstatic.<br />
<br />
BTW, an important addition to your list of druid strengths would be all the items that allow them to do mana-free damage. That's kind of a handy little deal that clerics don't have as an option too.</div></div><hr />

Then what was the purpose of the penalty??  Sure, give them the base healing of the spell, but VI is going to say that 5% bonus to Superior Heal is worth everything else they can do?

Clerics are grossly unbalanced.  Most players, both druids and clerics, will probably participate in few high end raids during their EQ lifetime yet druids are constantly demanding more capabilities using high end raids as the justification.</div></div><hr />

It is part of the priest balancing, which isnt even close to being done.  They are gearing up to make clerics, and I quote &quot;more well rounded&quot;.  Lets see what they give us before we flip out on what others are getting.  This is the first change of many.-<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevenim</div><div class="date">07-19-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I need to comment on the origional post here because frankly I can't see how anybody that has played a druid could agree with all the benefits he seems to think we have.<br />
<br />
First is forage, gee thanks alot VI, I have to work up a skill that goes up super slow If I ever want an epic weapon or to complete one of the very few other druid and ranger quests that require foraged items.<br />
<br />
Damage Shields, ok I can see this as a benefit but not a big one. It does not get used as much as you might think. If there is a mage around he will be casting that. the only time mine get's used is if there is another healer and no mage.<br />
<br />
Ports, benefit yes, big one yes, but with Luclin and soon PoP, just about obsolete.<br />
<br />
Group Ports, benefit? In certain circumstances, frankly though you can have them, I say give my group ports to clerics and I'll keep the self ones, then I'll only get begged for sow and not ports from surefall to NK, surefall to Tox, WC to BB, WC to Sro, basically a bunch of lazy people who think their time is more important than mine, they ask for ports to places they could run to faster with sow than it would take me to med the mana back for a port. Also, no luclin ports at all.<br />
<br />
Pet, I'll just assume he meant this one as a joke, cause he had LOL at the end, and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Dot's , no arguement they are nice, just remember that they don't do full damage unless the mob is stationary or running away, even so they are nice.<br />
<br />
Quad spells, I'll assume he means AoE spells and sow, and those are the only spells needed if done in the right places, benefit? yes, but with j-boots any class with an AoE spell can do it, and yes with practice clerics could with the earthquake line, just takes timing. Is it easier for us? yes, can almost every caster with j-boots and an AoE do it, yes. BTW I've yet to find a place on Luclin to quad.<br />
<br />
Snare, ok, big benefit, nice in groups and on raids but if the luclin trend of making mobs that can't be snared or rooted continues then soon to be obsolete. BTW rangers, necros, shamans and SK's can do this also.<br />
<br />
Attack buffs, gee firefist and wolf form are both self only and share wolf form is a minor spell at best, and again Luclin makes wolf form almost useless because every guard kos's wolf form<br />
<br />
Str buffs, woo hoo my caster won't be encumbered!!! (sense the sarcasm?)<br />
<br />
Regen, very nice line, no arguement<br />
<br />
Evacs, When was the last time you saw one used? most group leaders never make the call for an evac and evacing on raids is a huge no no on the ones I go to because not every group has a person to cast it, maybe they should but they don't.<br />
<br />
Debuffs, um let me see, some good some bad here. Ro's fiery sundering debuffs fire resist, good except that it is checked against fire resist so when you need it it is getting resisted. Fixation of Ro, works great for power leveling and light blue mobs, take it or leave it here. we get one more and it might be a nice spell but I don't get it till 56 and it seems to have the same issue as fiery sundering.<br />
<br />
Charms, ROFLMAO charm animal line plus one charm plants spell that can't even reasonably be gotten till 10 levels after you could cast it and by that time you can't charm most greens with it. the charm animal I've used 5 times in 53 levels and EVERY time I did it wore off at exactly the wrong time. Benefit? HELL NO!!!<br />
<br />
Pet buffs, yeah great idea, your charm sucks so let's have you buff those charmed pets so when charm breaks you get your butt kicked, maybe good after you have dire charm but the amount of druids that will ever have it is small. Benefit? before dire charm not at all.<br />
<br />
more weapon types, so what? a handful of scimitars we can use and we don't melee worth a damn anyway.<br />
<br />
Dire charm, um, sure I guess but are we talking about 1% of druids or all druids?<br />
<br />
Great nukes (his words not mine), Great no, better than we should have hell yes, Druid nukes are more powerful than they should be I am fully in favor as a druid of having my nukes nerfed, but only if that ability is replaced with improved healing ability, I am a priest class and Paladins have the same heal spells I do and can Rez? WTF is that about?<br />
<br />
solo ability and quad ability, yes we have them and they are the main reason druids aren't looked for in high end groups to sit next to the cleric, because so many druids solo their way to the 50+ game that they have no idea what half their spells do. I'm in favor here of a little nerfing also, not the ability mind you, just nerf the xp multiple kills with an AoE will get you and druids would learn to group more. The happy side effect being that less people would play the class.<br />
<br />
Druids up to 50 own clerics, is this really a cleric speaking? what planet does he live on? some of the abilities he listed are not even attainable till after 50.<br />
<br />
I agree with him on very few points here the most noticable being druids should NEVER get CH. I also don't believe he has ever played a druid. Druids ARE NOT balanced we need a ton of changes. And before you all start screaming at that statement remember that I'm in favor of nerfing our nukes and Quad ability not just giving us even more power. when I say we aren't balanced that does not mean I think we are under powered, just that our powers lie in the wrong area, we are a priest class not a caster class. As it stands now the only differences between INT and WIS casters is that none of the INT casters get heals and they need different stats, Verant screwed up somewhere along the line and muddied the waters separating the two. Then they only make it worse by not realizing the problem and trying to &quot;balance&quot; the Int and Wis casters seperately, If you don't look at them all at once then you don't see that waters between them and thus never realize they are muddy.<br />
<br />
Another thing , why is it so many clerics (not all) feel the need to say &quot;forget CH for a second&quot; ? isn't that alot like saying as a mage &quot;forget pets for a second&quot; ? fact is it exists and if I said &quot;forget quad kiting for a second&quot; then I'd get flamed to hell. Fact is that PoP MIGHT nerf CH but Luclin has ALREADY nerfed alot of druid abilities whether they meant to or not. Fact is that with or without CH clerics are a MUCH better healer that druids after level 24 when you get greater heal. yes it gets closer again at 29 when druids get it but at 34 the difference becomes huge when you get Superior heal. After 29 druids don't see another direct heal till level 51, by then you have Superior Heal, CH, HoT spells and we have the nice Regen line. <br />
<br />
Remember that druids are a priest class, we are supposed to be healers so why not spend more time thinking about how to make us better in that area without infringing on clerics and less time complaining about what one dumb kid said his class should get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badkarma</div><div class="date">07-19-2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm all for the 10% cap comeing off, just as soon as they loose some of that insane soloing ability.<br />
<br />
The way I look at it druids, Shammies and the rest took a 10% healing hit when they took on all the other spell lines.<br />
<br />
the snares the ports the dots the dd's the slows the debuffs ect ect.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">07-22-2002, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They're comparing them because a large number of Druids want to be able to replace Clerics ... and a large number of Clerics are afraid that if Druids beg long enough, they will.<br />
<br />
The comparison is skewed. I said it before and will say it again: their individual healing skills should not be compared between the two classes, but they should be compared to the role they're supposed to fill.<br />
<br />
At raids, Clerics should take care of the main, big heals. Druids should take care of the rest of the heals (possibly in unison with Paladins), with maybe Cleric assistance there.<br />
<br />
Indeed, they can't be compared. Instead, people should look where they're supposed to be in the large fruitbasket.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">07-22-2002, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok  lets look at what Clerics have.<br />
<br />
Heals-very good ones too<br />
Shield line-  Good AC buff<br />
Resolution Line- AC/HP buff <br />
Symbol Line- HP buff<br />
Self armor line-Nice after thought<br />
Divine Line- After the changes they made to getting stunned, a nice spell to have memmed now<br />
Resist spells- Not bad if you don't have something better<br />
Cure spells-  Pretty generic<br />
Fear- A life saving spell.  Totally useless without a snare line<br />
Root- a life saving spell.  Almost totally useless as it breaks from any damage 90% of the time.<br />
Calm line - lol I'd like to see a poll of Cleric who've actually used this spell more than once or twice.  There's better ways to kill yourself.<br />
DD's- Too bad they Magic based.<br />
Undead DD- Actually very good line<br />
Undead Dot.  They got tired of everyone complaining about root breaking<br />
AOE's-  Save your plat<br />
Summon food/water- Yay<br />
Invis undead- be nice if their was an undead zone I guess.  But they throw in Live mobs in all those so made it worthless<br />
Stuns- again not bad at mid level, but resisted 75% of the time in upper levels<br />
Ressurection- Like you SOW and Ports, a blessing and a curse.  Great for getting a raid back up and going.  Sucks to get 20 tells a nite asking you to run from SD to BW to res a friend of a friend.  Ya  Pallys get it, but really who gonna take a Pally res unless no Cleric is within  5 zones.<br />
<br />
No spell to help mana regen.  Guess you could say we have a DS with MoR, but thats magic based so not really a valid argument.<br />
<br />
Soloability.  Clerics have to have a group to level.  Mention nerfing a druids solo ability, and you better have your best Plate and resist armor on.  Druids want more heals?  fine.  Take their snare and give it to me, I'll give up my CHeal to them.  <br />

<br />
This is stupidity talking. I've seen this kind of logic before and it hurts to think how short sighted it is.<br />
<br />
Ultimately EVERYONE can achive this skill. Its not like its in some zone that 90% of players won't have the friend and resources to take down. ts a skill that all you have to do to get it kill stuff that is light blue or better to you.<br />
<br />
back before they changed the level cap to 60, there were no level 60s! &lt;duh&gt; Now everyone and his mother is or knows someone who has at least 1 level 60 of at least 1 class. Time is all it takes to achieve even the highest AA skills. That is all.<br />
<br />
So yes all druids have the potential to achive every AA skill<br />
<br />
To be clear, I'm saying that AA skills are all attainable by everyone, where as the Ancient spells, for example, will NOT all be attainable by everyone. There is a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiyre</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Aorion, we do have a spell to help with self mana regen, blessed armor of the rison.  Druids seem to be overlooking something though, POTG.  As Marzin's Mark comes into the game more and more, it is being preferred to do MM, POTG and Focus as opposed to Aegolism and focus. That is one thing that druids do have as a class defining spell, and it is wanted at raids.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nay</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a few characters, among them a 54 warrior and a 52 cleric (also have a necro, 2 monks, wizzy, etc).  My usual hunting group comprises of a 53 drood, 54 warrior, 52 shammie, 52 cleric, and sometimes an additional class (tank, chanter, wizzy etc even second shammy)...yes, I box the warrior and cleric.  <br />
<br />
Best group I have been on in a LONG time:  53 drood, 60 shammy, 60 chanter, 56 rogue, 55 ranja, 54 warrior. We made it all the way to the undead tower in the Hole... notice no cleric. Torpor with sup heal was more than enough to keep the tank alive.  <br />
<br />
The point is that many times we get stuck in roles for the classes, when as in life, we should think outside the box.  Each class has certain abilities, but those ablities are not unique.  No chanter? well bard anyone? necro?  No cleric? Well, druid? Shaman? You get my point?  While a warrior is the best damage absorber, its by no means the only class that can do it.  A well buffed SK or Paly can do the trick, for example. Pulling? No monk... well have a SK? or Ranja? or Bard? Heck, I've pulled as a necro.. group was chanter, cleric, necro... omg that was fun  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />
<br />
I see no reason why anyone should feel threatened (or encroached) by another class.  Yes, clerics heal more efficiently that any other class... notice i said more efficiently, not better...we have a whole variety of healing spells to help us do that... we have some very nifty AC/HP buffs, and of course rezzes... but if there were no clerics available to group should gameplay cease?  Of course not.<br />
<br />
Mind you all the above is geared towards the everyday grouping, not raids. Bottomline... I play, to &quot;hang out&quot; with my friends, first and foremost.  I love having a druid in my group and rarely go anywhere without the druid (or the shammy). <br />
<br />
Now want to talk about a class that gets their butt wiped constantly?  Be a shammy... as we all know slow aggro is insane (and they said its fixed ..oy) and my cleric sometimes spends almost as much mana to heal (or rez) the shammy as healing the tank.<br />
<br />
Btw, this is reply to the greedy clerics thread... 85% of the times I never even take a doantion for a rez... if I am not grouped or busy atm &quot;mana is free&quot; ... never have i charged for a rez... and only take a donation, when offered, if I am grouped and the rez is taking away time from my group.  At which point the donation becomes part of the night's loot to be split with the group.         <br />

Why must I, a noble Dwarven Cleric have to deal with drinking too much and then find myself unbalanced.<br />
<br />
It's a travesty, I tell you! I demand that Verant fix this and allow me to down 8 Gnomish Spirits without a hitch. Why my druid friend was able to drink 7 without so much as batting an eyelid....ok that was after he regained consciousness.<br />

Verant needs to be reminded that Clerics won't stand up for this! Especially when we drink too much! Bah, I'm going to play an Ogre Warrior just to let them have it!<br />

Hell no, Cheal or not I go oom very quickly healing tanks in a group. My 1k heal is 400 mana, thats almost as much as clerics Cheal. We have close the same amount in healing but the mana costs are way way different. Clerics are FAR FAR better healers even without cheal.<br />

Must every class have a very specific and important job to do on a raid?  <br />
Because then they will be useful in guilds perhaps? If there is no roll for them to play then there is no need to have them in your guild. (i.e. Fires of Heaven have what 2 druids in there whole guild?) Thats because there is no REAL roll for a druid except a port whore and a wizard can do that.  This is why Varent gave us the new Cheals.<br />

In the high end game, you evac, you piss off the magicians who have to coth you back, etc. <br />
It depends. If I get a cleric out before the party is whiped im praised. Trust me, its nice to get a cleric out when the raid goes bad. Sometimes there is no time for a cleric to camp and the location is easy to get back to.</div></div><hr />
