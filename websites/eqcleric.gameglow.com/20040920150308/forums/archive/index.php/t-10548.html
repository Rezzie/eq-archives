<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thessalian</div><div class="date">04-07-2000, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a string of deaths in Unrest due to incredibly incompetent groups and losing level 28 four times in a row, I finally sighed and went back to SK. Instead of trying  to get an outside Paw spire (yeah right) or waiting to be able to grab the occasional harrier or avocet at KFC, we took a friend's advice at went to the centaur village. In the open plain to the west of the village we killed archers, coursers, and chargers (the chargers were hardest and *almost* killed us more than once). I was at 28 partnered with a level 29 paladin. We each gained a level in a few evenings of hunting there (I think I got three bubbles the first night), and he gained a bubble and a half into hell level 30. <br />
<br />
We didn't pull directly from the village, although I know some do. This is a big open area, and you can get a lot more pulls if you have your clipping plane adjusted upwards to scan the horizon for horse shapes, and don't mind running after things a ways away (obviously SoW is nice). There seems to be a wandering Aviak path here, sometimes harriers  or even avocets. And there is no faction associated with centaurs - you can go into the village and sell right back to them.<br />
<br />
The best part is that we rarely saw other groups there, just the occasional soloer. <br />
<br />
This is the kind of easy safe experience I used to look down my nose at, until I realized how difficult it is to get in a good dungeon group.</div></div><hr />
