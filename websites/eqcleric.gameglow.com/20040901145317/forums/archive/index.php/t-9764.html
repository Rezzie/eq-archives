It’s easier if you know that there is a bug in the game, if you are trading with someone and one of the containers in the trade window is open when the trade is canceled, then the player with the open bag goes Link Dead (LD).<br />
<br />
JUNE, a Wizard I used to group in Mistmoore with, approached me outside the Kelethin bank and said she wanted to trade with me. I had heard a rumor that she had sold her account on EBAY, so I was wary; I check and I had Lay on Hands, full health and full mana, she’s blue to me… so what the heck, I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt… She showed me her “bag of goodies” and said that was what she was trading. So, I open the bag and a few seconds later, BAM! Disconnected… When I logged back on I’m at my bind point…<br />
<br />
Talking to some of the people outside the bank I discovered that June had indeed PK’d me. I go back to the bank and with some help find my body (it’s on the platform above the bank now). Sure enough she’d looted my body of about 7pp and my most prized possession, an Enameled Black Breastplate! (well my ghoulbane is my most prized, but she couldn’t loot that).<br />
<br />
I do a /who gm all and find there is a lvl 50 GM on. So I send him a tell. He says “that’s an exploit. You should petition.” So, I do, I send a petition. Now, here’s the best part. The GM says, “you should only trade with people you trust.” A few points here, first I knew June, I did trust her, if I hadn’t heard the rumor I would have had no idea what had happened. Second since day one I have been trading like crazy. I love trading. Instead of taking up a trade skill I have spent hours finding good deals from other players and travelling the world to trade. Buy low sell high has been my motto. I am very proud of my equipment (most people are amazed at my stuff, it takes them a long time to believe I am not a twink). For a GM to tell me that I should only trade with people I trust (IMHO suggesting that I was at fault) was an added insult to everything. <br />
<br />
Anyway, A few minutes later a lvl 19 guide gets on and tells me that “that’s an exploit and I’ve bumped it up the ladder for the GM.” THREE HOURS later I still have no response from the GM. So I send the guide a tell and he says the GM isn’t on. I don’t ask him about the lvl 50 GM I spoke with earlier, obviously this is not the guy I need to talk with… (FYI I was PK’d at approx. 9pm and it’s now almost 1am EST).  I ask if he has any idea when the GM will be on, he says no. About 30 mins later my ISP shuts down (just wasn’t my day to play EQ) and 60 mins later is still not up… So I go to sleep.<br />
<br />
I am writing you for several reasons: to warn you about this bug and exploit, to express my frustration with the GM response , “you should only trade with people you trust,” to express my frustration with the lack of a GM who could answer my questions during what I would think was a peak playing time and ultimately to make myself feel better… I cannot begin to describe how frustrated I am with this… (although when I calm down I’m sure I’ll be less annoyed). I don’t even want to begin to describe the lengths I went to get that breastplate…<br />

<br />
I don't play on a PVP server but it's still good to know about the LD bug as it could cause problems in the game.<br />
<br />
As for the DMs, Never had one yet who actually did anything about anything in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck, You will need it.<br />
