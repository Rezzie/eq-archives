<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llumis</div><div class="date">06-27-2000, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night, I died in Frontier Mountains.  It was post hell, and I lost more than a bubble of exp.  I left something on my body, and did a /who cleric.  not /who cleric 39-60 all, but just /who cleric, to see if there were any rezzers in the zone.  There were 3, levels 49,50, and anon.  I knew the anon was rez-capable, because I recognized him as a purple people healer.  Each, in turn, I sent this message: <br />
&quot;Hello, I understand that you are most likely busy, and I completely understand that.  However, I find myself in need of a rez, and would appreciate it if you could assist me.  I will drag the body to you, and I will pay for your services. If you can not help me, please let me know, so I may ask someone else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Level headed, polite, and understanding.  Not &quot;Rez?&quot;, not &quot;Dood, can I get a rez?&quot;, not shouting 18 bajillion times to the zone.(I did shout 3 times over a span of 5 minutes, which I don't consider spam.)  From one person, I got the answer &quot;We are just moving on, I can't help you right now.&quot; Perfectly fine, no problem.  From the other two, I got no answer whatsoever.  Again, I asked them 3 times each, with a few minutes between each request.  I find it incredibly rude that I got no answer.  Almost as rude as the warrior who trained my group not once, not twice, but 3 times last night, and claimed to have &quot;taken a wrong turn&quot; each time, though he only seemed to take &quot;wrong turns&quot; when he had 4 or more giants.  <br />
<br />
How long does it take to type &quot;/reply sorry, busy.&quot;  Thats all I wanted.<br />

I forget to reply, am in the middle of a fight or a tired of thinking up a nice way to say no. I miss a lot of tells to afk, battle spam or tell hell. Its easy to jump on someone because they arent returning, but generally theres a reason for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">07-06-2000, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Say you're sitting in a room, and there is a child in the room who is constantly screaming.  It's not your child, so you don't have a right to do anything about the child screaming.  After a while you adapt and tune the child out.  If you don't adapt and tune them out you'll go insane.<br />
<br />
Well 49+ clerics have adapted.  The child is the person asking for the rez.  We have been forced to adapt to tuning out rez requests because we've already heard 3,000 of them in the last month.  We have been forced to adapt because we've learned that some people can't take no for an answer, and we never know when that is going to happen again.  Do you enjoy having every curse word thrown at you?  Well neither do I, but I've seen it time and time again when I've actually responded in the past to that rez request and said no.  Do you enjoy having a complete stranger telling you that it is your DUTY to do something?  I don't.. but again, I've heard it time and time again.<br />
<br />
I hardly even see rez requests anymore as I've learned to tune them all out.  Sound rude?  Well, you pay my $10 charge for everquest and I'll be your personal EQ Rez Cleric 24/7.  But until that happens, which it isn't going to happen, I am playing on my time, and doing what I want, when I want.. and if that means that I will avoid a question in hopes that I don't get cursed at for my response.. so be it.<br />
<br />
Suggest for you since you are a cleric.  Save your rant, and re-read it when you're 49+.  I can guarantee that you'll be shaking your head thinking to yourself &quot;What was I ranting about???&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally get a bit aggravated by fear-kiting, as it takes me away from responding to advice and requests.<br />
<br />
It may be that the person you were asking was in a similar situation that I was, where I had very little time to respond to every tell thrown my way.<br />

After all, ressing a cleric today might mean that he will res you a week later.</div></div><hr />
