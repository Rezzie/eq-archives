Am I just some old fashioned cleric?  Why is it I go on raids, and there is only one other cleric besides me who uses hotkeys (and seriously, I have NEVER seen a druid or a shaman announce heals).  Why is it I cast CH with an announce on the MT and 1 second before it drops, someone else's CH lands (and he's no where near death either)?  This continues to boggle me, and I can't help but wonder why healers do not see the benefits of announcing heals...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panteroo</div><div class="date">08-06-2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me there are 2 basic instances this happens in.. raids or exp groups.<br />
<br />
In exp group whether I am playing my Cleric, Rogue, or Monk they get one chance and then I politely ask them to have hotkeys for any healing spells so I know what's going on because I am nosy... that goes for rangers and paladins as well, especially with the pallies group heals.<br />
<br />
In raids with my guild there are no exceptions since I run atleast the healing show if not the whole thing. All healing spells are required to be called out in group and raid chat channels. Additionally all spell names are required to be in full caps and the healing target must be made easily identifiable... By that I mean that I don't want to have to read a novel to find out what or who the blessed mother tunare is healing, I want:<br />
<br />
Panteroo tells raid1: REMEDY on &lt;&lt;&lt; Bob &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
They can be creative as they want to be so long as spell name and target are easily identifiable. <br />
<br />
I am a little to anal to not have than information when i am grouped/raiding.<br />

The only healer that did *not* announce heals was the main healer (the healer of the MA).  /boggle<br />
<br />
I didn't say anything because it was my first hate raid, but I didn't quite understand that.  Why bother to set up a healers channel, if you aren't going to use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you have 10 clerics 4 druids 4 shamans 4 paladins on a raid, if every heal is announced, you end up in spam hell. Personally I announce DL/CE/CH in group, most of the time anyway... sometimes I confine myself to just CH, and occasionally I don't announce at all. At a certain point the other players in your group just have to trust that you know wtf you are doing. Likewise... you have to trust the other healers you are playing with to know what they are doing as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can only say I pitty you the groups you got. I dont announce my heals 99% of the time. Why? Because if my group dont trust me to heal them with the heal I consider needed in time then they can go to hell. I am the cleric, my job is to keep them alive, if they dont trust me to do my job and demand me to constantly announce what I am doing so can they go get them self a cleric bot. The only time it is intresting to announce it if things goes wrong way and I am locked in a CH or similar and the enchanter gets resists and starts to tank.<br />
<br />
If I got a back up healer that I dont know so will I explain how I heal and when I want them to kick in with patch healing. If I got a back up healer that I know so will they know how I play (=.<br />
<br />
Think for a minute, why would you announce your heals? It is not because you aint sure what you will use for heal, the tanks for sure dont need to know how you heal, their concern should be that they ARE healed how you do it is your job. So why are you announcing it? For secondary healers? Educate them or when it matters send them a tell / say in group can you throw a heal on X. For the other clerics there? Should they not trust you to keep someone alive in the first place?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaysha Soulsinger</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see both sides here.<br />
<br />
How do I heal? Or better said, how do I hotkey them? Frankly, the way I have my primary bank set-up now, I can only hotkey 3 healing spells, the other hotkeys are set up for other useful tasks that I personally can't miss.<br />
<br />
So I have to make a choice, since I have 4 healing spells memmed. By nature (by now, anyway), I have Remedy, Celestial Healing and Complete Healing hotkeyed, divine light and my legs aren't. Of these, I only announce Complete Healing into the raid channel; the other two heals are in group channel only.<br />
<br />
Lately, however, we have been setting up a cleric channel during raids (past two or so) and I announce all heals there as well. With only 5 Clerics there or so (with a few others tapping in, like the twitching necro or the raid leader), it's manageable.<br />
<br />
I find it at least pleasant to know when another Cleric is casting Complete Healing and who the target is, and as such like it when that is announced. Also, when I am casting Complete Healing myself, I find it pleasant to know if someone else is slinging on a fast heal in the mean time, buying me more breathing space, so I can stop worrying whether or not CHeal will land in time.<br />
<br />
Also, I often use ALT-# to cast spells, which cuts out the hotkey ... bad habit at times as it lacks information on what I'm casting, should work on that.<br />
<br />
In groups for regular exp grinds, I only announce my CHeal, no others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When having messages that say something.  You need to think, 'what is the purpose of this message'<br />
<br />
If you say you are CH'ing a certain person, is there a person who can make use of that information and act accordingly?  If there is not then why say it?<br />
<br />
If I say i am going to CH someone else and someone else says they will CH the same person at exactly the same time - what may happen?  You have a chance that both will cancel, and the entire aim of keeping the person alive is lost.<br />
<br />
The best form of communication is silent.  If theres a certain situation, knowing what someone else will do without prompting is what you are aiming at.<br />
<br />
I often announce im group CH'ing in group, the reason is very simply.  I want people who are not tanking to look at their position relative to me and make sure they get hit by the heal.<br />
<br />
Communication has to serve a purpose otherwise you are just filling up chat which might make a useful message get missed.<br />
<br />
So always think - do other people need to know this to change what they are going to do.  If not then you don't really have to say it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finine</div><div class="date">08-07-2002, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My thinking with this thread was more about raids than groups.  Yes, I announce in groups but generally I group with guildies or allies and they trust me to keep them alive.<br />
<br />
Raids are another story, though. I can't count the times I have wasted mana because I cast a CH on someone only to land it a split second after someone else (who didn't announce) - too late to duck.  The responsibility is generally on the MT (not just the group you're in - and if the MT isn't in your group what good does it do to just announce to them anyway?), and I feel it's important for the clerics in the raid to know when that MT is getting healed.<br />

<br />
In exp groups, for several reasons.  The Tanks need the info.  Not because they don't trust us, but for example, so they know where *we* are on the aggro list.  If I'm doing a pickup group, it soothes the tanks to know a heal has been cast, as we get used to each other.  And it doesn't cost anything to us, other than the initial set up to use em.  <br />
<br />
I can't really talk about raids as all I've been on yet are 1 hate raid, 1 kael plate cycle, and a few epic fights.  I just found it odd that there would be a healers channel and the main healer didn't use it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiyre</div><div class="date">08-08-2002, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saarem, I feel exactly the same way.  If I am the only cleric in a group odds are I will not announce any of my heals, save when there is a potential problem.  This is never an issue in any of the group situations I've been in.  I feel that trust is huge, and if they can just concentrate on their job instead of looking for the hotkeyed incoming heal, they can do their job better.  If I am in a raid group with 2 clerics, I will announce all my heals so we can coordinate better.  <br />
<br />
If during a raid, a person in my single cleric group is too nervous, I will switch over to announcing every single heal I'm doing (in and out of group) to the group.  They get so spammed with heal messages that they eventually get the picture. =/<br />
<br />
Most of the guild understands how each of the clerics operate now.  There's good points and bad points to both sides.  All in all its just the cleric's own style.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minahs</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm the Priest Class officer for my guild.  We're a mid-sized guild (about 50 members or so), mostly 55+.<br />
<br />
We have a permanent chat channel for all of the priest classes, and almost everyone autojoins it, so whether we're raiding, playing alts, or xp grinding, all of the clerics, druids, and shamen in my guild are in the channel at all times when logged on.<br />
<br />
For the most part, it's easygoing.  When we're raiding, I make it a rule that anyone who is on and is not at the raid leave the chat channel.  All heals must be called in the priest channel and not in the raid channel (to avoid extra raid channel spam).  Whether the priests want to call their heals in group is their choice entirely.  No &quot;cute&quot; heal messages are allowed in the channel during raids, although I get a kick out of some of the ones they use when we're not raiding.  Everything needs to be plain and simple (Casting Divine Light on Tank_01).<br />
<br />
The reason that I do this is because I like to keep watch on everything that is going on.  There isn't a cleric in my guild that I don't trust to make the correct decision when it comes to healing.  But you learn a lot from watching who's getting healed when.  You see who's getting aggro that shouldn't, you see when a cleric is in trouble because a mob flurries or enrages or AE's and they're trying to keep 5 people alive all of a sudden instead of just the MT.  It stops 12 people from landing CH at once.  If more than one of us casts a CH, at the same time, one of us will say &quot;cancel&quot; in priest chat, and once we have done so, the first person to say &quot;cancel&quot; ducks and interrupts.  We've eliminated a lot of double CH's that way.  If we see a cleric spam healing a person, all healers who aren't busy know to assist that cleric to make sure everything is under control.  The druids and shamen will let us know that we can save mana on Caster_X because they can heal them or top them off.  We invite our necros into the channel if they want to join.  We call all post-fight mana checks in the priest channel, and I report to raid leader when all priests are ready instead of having the raid channel spammed with all of the clerics saying &quot;fom&quot;.  Overall, it's improved our communication tenfold, and I've seen major development in our lower level clerics as far as mana management and heal timing, and we rarely ever have a death on a raid (unless we wipe, but at least when we do something, we do it all the way =D )  It's made us a tight-knit group, and we've gotten a lot accomplished, and have a lot of fun hanging out in the channel together.<br />
<br />
As far as xp groups, I always call heals in group, always have, always will.  I usually group with friends or guildies, and they all trust me to keep them alive, but I think people generally feel safer when they know a heal is coming.  And if you heal efficiently, you won't be spamming your group with heal messages. =D<br />

So why are you announcing it?<br />
I beg to differ. I play a warrior, and trust me I'm very interested in knowing if my cleric is DL'ing the enchanter while I might need a heal if I pulled a couple extra singles on that pull that just came in. In that case, I'll just pop evasive and get hit less in the meantime - buying the cleric time to DL and CE the ENC before CH'ing me.<br />
<br />
If I bring back 4-5 mobs, the last thing I want is the cleric to pop a CH on me right as I get back to the group, because I'll never taunt them all of the cleric before both divines are down.<br />
<br />
By your reasoning, why would anyone ever communicate what they are doing? I mean, the puller might bring 1, 2 or n mobs, but that's their job and they know how to do it. Why should the ENC or SHM bother to announce CC-targets? I dunno, I like playing with people who communicate well.<br />
<br />
Aldur, in your example about both people ducking out... Just make a rule that says noone can duck out of a heal, then you won't have lost anything from the current state of affairs (both CHs will land about the same time) - but you will have given the group or raid the information that you are engaged for 10 seconds which is always useful.</div></div><hr />

*grin*<br />
<br />
The truly old fashioned clerics dont use socials because socials hadn't been added to the game when they leveled up.<br />
<br />
As for me, its a trust issue.  If I think anyone is going to be nervous (new area, grouping with strangers, tough area, etc) I will use socials with my cleric and chanter.  I dont use them by default.  <br />
<br />
In a raid I do whatever socials we're supposed to, but I still do non-aggro heals in my own party without a social.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">08-09-2002, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Communication is essential on raids, thats why i INSIST on every healer to have hotbutton for their healing on our guild raids.<br />
By healer i mean clerics, druids, shammies and occasionally rangers and pallies.<br />
<br />
i announce all my heals, in a raid or in a xp group. mostly because my hotbutton has slight pause between casting commands that helps if i get a fizzle.  and i have another healer in group i expect them to have a hotbutton for healing announcements.<br />
<br />
best is to have simple announcements, like:<br />
CH on &lt;&lt;&lt; target &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
DL on &lt;&lt;&lt; target &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
CE...Remedy etc.<br />
i have the same format on all heals.<br />
its short and to the point.<br />
<br />
personally i hate the long annoncements...:<br />
&quot;By the Power granted by Brell to me i bestow my grandest heal of all to target to sooth his wounds!&quot;<br />
<br />
GAAAAAHHH!<br />
<br />
The end point of this all is that Communication is extremely important, both to preserving mana and just to let people know that they are being healed.<br />
<br />
and one other thing, we have a rule about 2 or more clerics casting CH at the same time...the first one to give message casts..the others duck.  <br />

I was L30 before they even IMPLIMENTED the scriptable hotkeys. I learned to play without them and just recently really started using them. Just never saw a reason to.<br />
<br />
Typically new clerics start off with hotkeys as a general rule of thumb.<br />
<br />
So all you newbies who started a cleric after the changes took place, don't complain, we did it back when we had to use the mouse!</div></div><hr />

Its somewhat of a luxury, kind of like the ability to duck and cancel a spell (another added feature).<br />

<br />
As for healing spam, that's why I have 3 chat windows. Excessive? not really. They are all on the bottom of my screen. From left to right they are: Raid channel window, Main window (inc. emotes, /gu, say), and my tell window.<br />
<br />
Tell window? sure! How frustrating is it to have to scroll in the middle of a battle to reply to something. Or forget that someone sent you a tell and then have the person either spam you or think you're still sore about them teasing them in public channels about their most embarassing CR experience. er... I mean...<br />
<br />
<br />
I used to have these shnazzy little heal messages like &quot;Healing soandso! Next round's on me if you live!&quot; But seeing that spammed so many times in a short while even had me getting sick of it. Lately my heal messages have been (for all settings mind you) as follows:<br />
<br />
&quot;Compete Heal : %T&quot;, <br />
&quot;Celestial Heal : %T&quot;, <br />
and &quot;Patching : %T&quot;. <br />
<br />
That's it. Because really, who has time to read your cute little message and figure out what you did in the middle of a raid situation? <br />
<br />
Raid channels are great because they allow for more communication. I expect to see everyone calling out their debuffs, heals, and when defensive is going down. That way everyone is on the same page and we work as a team.<br />

If there is not then why say it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For one simple reason:  Good habits are easy to learn and bad habits are hard to break.<br />
<br />
I could be in a raid of 20+ people or in a group duoing with a tank partner...I'm still going to announce every heal.  Why? Because at that point *NOBODY* has the right to complain &quot;Well, you didn't heal him/her...&quot; because it's always right there in the chat window for everyone to see.  <br />
<br />
On my CH hotkey, I announce who I'm healing and the fact that I'm out of action for 10 seconds. It's there to let others know that I'm doing my job and to let the back up healers know when they may need to patch heal.  On raids, I add the line in the hotkey to announce it to the raid channel.<br />
<br />
In a lot of situations, communication is vital for the group's survival.  Just like the puller who always announces what he/she is bringing back and how many, I'm communicating to my group/raid that I'm doing my job and I'm paying attention.  In my opinion, healers (including back up healers) who don't call their heals are being selfish...*that healer* might know what's going on, but the group doesn't.  You have to communicate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiyre</div><div class="date">08-14-2002, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol I honestly don't see why not calling your heals is selfish.  You have a different perspective on it is all, no need to call others who don't do things the exact same way as you selfish.  <br />
<br />
For example, I duo with my fiancee, a warrior, all the time.  He knows exactly when I start my ch'es because he knows my style of play.  He also knows that if I will have any possible trouble at all, I will announce my heals, say that I need help, or instruct on what to do to help me.  I feel that by not calling my heals to him that it will help him worry less about his health and concentrate more on his job.  He knows that I am paying attention to his health and that I do my job well.   <br />
<br />
Because at that point *NOBODY* has the right to complain<br />
<br />
You shouldn't be worrying that other people will think that you aren't healing them.  You shouldn't be doing something just to prove yourself to others.   If something goes wrong most people know what went wrong, and yes, even if you do announce your heals people can and do still complain---that alone won't solve it.  For example, people may complain to you that you should have started you heal earlier.  But when you group with someone, you trust them to do their job right.  The warrior doesn't announce that they are taunting something, you trust they are.  <br />
<br />
If I am grouping with people I ususally don't group with, I will explain that I normally don't call my heals, but if it makes them feel better I will.  Most of the time, the people say they are fine with me not calling my heals.  If however I am grouped with another cleric I will always call my heals so that we don't overlap.<br />
<br />
All in all the debate on whether or not to use healing hotkeys is just 2 different perspectives, niether side is right or wrong, so no need to be so insulting to how others play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shabaza</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Message jes or no.<br />
<br />
As I have several chars post 50 I nearly know both sides.<br />
<br />
I think the announcement of Spells should be limited to these parts which would have a real informative side.<br />
<br />
Thats things like ( Tashed  / Malo on it / Slowed / Snared .... )<br />
<br />
For some Situations its nice to announce a CH cause of the time consuming part and the no Heal ability in that time.<br />
<br />
Announcing od DA and DB is great.<br />
<br />
Announcing of Remedy ... Cel Heal ..  naaaa not really.<br />
<br />
Its like the Warr made a Hotkeyed .. &quot; Now taunting a %T &quot; or the Rogue makes a  Hotkeyed &quot; Now backstabbing a %T &quot;<br />
<br />
When you have to heal the chanter and the backuphealer casts a sup heal in the same direktion .. nice .. chanter alive .. 2 heals in short period of time aggro splitted .. <br />
<br />
As a Tank I am not interested in reading healing messages, except that one which I got when heal is landed. As a Tank I have my eyes on the health bars of the group to see if someone is attacked.<br />
<br />
As a Rogue .. hm rarely got healed <br />
<br />
As a Druid .. oh I trust my groupcleric to do the right thing but make my own decision if it would be nessessary to throw a heal in or not.<br />
<br />
As a Necro .. same as rogue and druid.<br />
<br />
As a Cleric I give only messages when I am in a CH rotation to inform the next one. Maybe in spez zones like CT I would also announce CH for informing the others that I cant heal them in moment.<br />

I keep two banks of keys, one calls all heals and one that only has a &quot;ch %t&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The spam group is used when I'm working with another healer in the group, espeically a druid that keeps healing just after I use CE on somebody.  If' I'm in a group with healer that works well I don't even use the spam keys.<br />
<br />
Now it's fun to watch the warrior or monk that's pulling frezze in their tracks when the CH spam hits.  That can be the best root in the game.  A good mele knows the casting time of CH and will use that to their advantage.  Monks that pull will stand and get hit a bit on incoming while the warrior builds agro until a couple seconds before the CH hits then FD so the cleric doesn't get pounded.  Good warriors will watch thier hp go down and hit the disc if your CH is late. Backup healers will know if you are late and they need to toss in a quick heal.<br />
<br />
I've found that when you played this game thousands of hours cute roleplaying spam every heal gets very tiresome.</div></div><hr />

I still have my roleplaying spam one for my nuke tho.  since it doesn't happen as often, its not as annoying.  :D<br />
<br />
I call CH and Celestial.  Remedy if I'm on a raid.  <br />
<br />
Though after being on the second floor of hate, I think I *do* need hotkeys for DA/DB.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myth24601</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Druid, I use a hotkey for chloroblast and either switch in a group only or raid one depending on the situation.  I think it's important in groups for me to know what the cleric is doing as far as heals go, especially with Cheal since the long cast time ties up the cleric.  <br />
<br />
People saying that they are good at what you do and everyone should trust they will keep them alive should set aside some of that ego and realize that comunication is a good help not only to letting the melees know what's going on but also so that the backup healer can know what's up.  Not anouncing heals will eventually get somone killed needlessly because at some point, you will lag or fizzle or something that will cause you to be late at getting that heal off.  <br />
<br />
In HOT, I have been Main healer a lot for groups of secondary Melee and casters and have taken to having a hotkey that goes like this /1 Need Healing help on %t. While it rarely happens, things sometimes go bad and I have to blow a manabar on heals or get caught without enough mana for a fight, usually a cleric or aonther Druid/Shammy/Pally will see it and help me out.  It's kind of a Druid Cheal spell, I call for help and suddenly, my target is completely healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alerias</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I announce my heals, the only one that has anything close to 'cute' spam is something similiar to:<br />
I am Celestial Healing (healing over time) %t<br />
<br />
I call the rest simply for aggro safety.  I've had weird situations such as casting a SH at lvl 49 when a mob broke out of mez in the middle of the casting, and attacked me.  The tank told me he was able to taunt off more quickly (it only got one hit on me) because he knew it would come after me due to my healing message.<br />
<br />
I think it's best to notify the party in a clear, concise way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for hotkeys, while xping I don't bother really. If there's new people (rare, usually group with friends) I'll just type /g CH %T after I've started the hotkey.<br />
<br />
Raids and (obviously) CH chains I use hotkeys - but only for CH.<br />
<br />
If someone has started a CH on a tank in a raid situation when the tank is really low and needs a patch heal I'll start a DL and then type /gu DL %T so they know they've got a DL and CH incoming and won't die... but other than that I don't announce DL and I HATE HATE HATE CE!@</div></div><hr />

People have so many playing styles that tolerance is in order as well.. your way is not always the best way.<br />
In experience groups I only call my Complete Heals, DA and Help messages. <br />
For complete heals I added into my macro /&quot;channel name here&quot; Casting a complete heal on %t, I may need backup heal support. This allows any others healers the opportunity to cast a quick heal if they believe it may be needed. <br />
My DA is simply to let everyone know I have it up and can not cast &quot;DA UP, Backup heal support may be needed&quot;. <br />
And for the times I am getting beat on I use my cute help message to get attention &quot; %T IS TOUCHING ME ON MY NO NO PLACE &gt;&gt;&gt; PUNISH IT!!!!&quot;. This is always in caps so the taunter can see the message. Any short messages may be missed and mistaken for spam.<br />
<br />
For raids it is different. If I am in a rotation we call all heals to include assists. Those will read &quot;Complete healing %t. 5 seconds to rotation to Cleric#&quot;. If anything you see the name of the person everyone is healing and can change if necessary. These are to be kept very simple. You can also easily tell if someone misses their time in the rotation.<br />
It is all a matter of preference, and to tell anyone they are wrong for doing things their way just makes you look mean and intollerant of people doing things differently.<br />
I also play a 54 warrior btw and don't expect to see any spam but the complete heal messages and mez's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corish-MT</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Groups:  around level 45 I stopped calling anything but Complete Heal - why? because it lets my backup healer know that they need to handle emergencies for the next 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
My rule-of-thumb for hot-key messages (especially on a raid) is &quot;Will it make someone else act differently as a result?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Raids:  Depends on who I'm raiding with, we'll either only call CH, or CH and DL, up to calling everything in the raid channel.  Primary and secondary clerics sometimes call everything, while backup clerics only call CH's.  Again, this is decided on a raid-by-raid basis, although the usual is to only call CH and DL (major mana investment spells).  The other cleric that I normally work with is in constant communication with me via tells (in fact, we'll often swap duties mid-fight because one of us is getting lower on mana).  The key there is &quot;communication&quot;.  <br />
<br />
However things are setup on a raid situation, I have 2 banks of identical keys - one is setup in the &quot;preferred&quot; mode for that event (call on CH, call DL/CH, call it all, etc.).  But I also have a 2nd bank that will switch me into call everything mode when I need to.  (e.g. when the MA cleric goes down, and I need to take over.)<br />
<br />
I see no point in a raid situation of calling heals in both groupchat and raidchat - it just makes that much more spam for people to sift through for the same amount of information.  Also, I keep my heal calls extremely simple to cut down on the mental work to decipher them &quot;COMPLETE HEAL [ %T ] 10 SECONDS!&quot;, or &quot;DIVINE LIGHT [ %T ]&quot; or &quot;REMEDY [ %T ]&quot;.  Short, sweet, and different enough that the other clerics can immediately tell my heals and which heal I'm casting.<br />
<br />
Hmm, as to the case where two clerics cast CH at the same time?  We discuss that ahead of time and each cleric has a area of responsibility (meaning that if you see the primary cleric for that person also casting CH, you duck and immediately call a remedy or DL).  CH is one of those spells that you anticipate anyway - so it should be as simple for 2 clerics to constantly say, &quot;40m take next CH&quot;, &quot;okay&quot;.  I have been on very few raids where one of the clerics has a &quot;hero complex&quot;, and that quickly ends once the raid leader sees that the backup clerics are at full mana, while the &quot;hero&quot; is constantly low mana.   The clerics that I currently work with are completely away from &quot;this is my person, don't you dare put a heal on them&quot;, to &quot;use your mana as you see fit, druids and shaman included, and we'll kill more mobs faster&quot;.<br />
<br />
Things may change once we get into the upper-end zones, right now we're doing 2-6 group raids, where the MA takes most damage, but maybe we have 3-4 mobs in camp at the same time (some mezzed, some tank-mezzed).  We'll have a MA cleric, SA cleric, and the other clerics are responsible for patch healing, or guarding an enchanter or slower.  (I spent too much time full-mana on a few raids as the lowbie cleric, so I volunteered to keep the enchanter alive - MA cleric told me to go right ahead and they'd only step in if it looked like I needed help - now it's pretty much standard practice for us.)<br />
<br />
Also, I added a &quot;CORISH IS DIVINED! NO HEALS FOR 18 SECONDS!&quot; hot-key sometime in the past few months (probably due to PoH 2nd floor).  I hardly ever use it (sometimes I DA without telling a group), it's more for those cases where I am in SERIOUS trouble and someone's gonna die (and not always me!).<br />
<br />
/em wonders why this thread is in rants... (dratted clerics are just too darn nice even when they rant).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ludashanus</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally, a topic that I can respond to.<br />
<br />
Ever since I got my keys for that icy place, velious I believe, I can't keep it in any of my containers. First, I had a pouch for shaman and the stench! Ack, it took me three days of swimming just to get the smell out of my cloaks (and they are bronze mind you).<br />
<br />
Has anyone else complained about the keys getting so hot, you have to put them into a metal container, especially one that does not conduct heat? Gnomes usually don't give me helpful advice, they just snicker and cry out. &quot;Hot Cleric! Oh, no, hot cleric!&quot; I thought they were complimenting me, but when I learned Gnome, the truth came out.<br />
<br />
So if anyone can help me with my hot key problem, I'd very much appreciate it. I do find that when I'm running with the spirit of the wolfie spell the key doesn't get so hot, but then afterwards, I get such a headache.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm sure I'll post another to that angle.<br />

Heal over times? Depends.. when I heal a rodspitter I just type it in say or so.<br />

If everyone in the group has faith, I will heal as needed and not call it out with hotkeys. <br />
If everyone in the group needs their hand-held, I will use them.<br />

On a raid  - I will do what is necessary to communicate with the raid group and keep the group alive as well as the MA from soiling his shorts.<br />
