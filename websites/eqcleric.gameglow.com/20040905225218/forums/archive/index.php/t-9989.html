<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherazade</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You may call me a n00b cleric or a cleric that doesn't understand raiding at all but nevertheless I have to get this from my chest: <br />
<br />
Calling out heals: I hate to be on raids where every cleric calls out ever single heal they make!<br />
<br />
Imagine a raid with 6 groups - every group has 1 cleric - one cleric probably heals 3-6 times (aoe-fight) means about 20 heal-messages per fight. Not only they may increase lag, but also they make me nervous, because I start to think we are in big troubles.<br />
<br />
It makes sense to me to call out Complete Healings, so the other healers can help to keep the maintank up with underheals and show the people on the raid that you are not sleeping  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Healing messages - please if you are on raids and decided to call out every heal, keep it small and simple. Messages like: The voices told me to heal you %t with my remedy/CE/CH or Pumping %t with celestial healing or OMG OMG %t is in trouble - wait Complete Healing is incoming. 10 sec casting time may be funny for groups but when I have a busy time healing the MA and have to &quot;filter&quot; every message 1. who heals 2. who got healed 3. what spell is used  I go nuts.<br />
<br />
Heal adequately - Raid PoF - break in. My group is MA, one enchanter, lvl 60 druid, rogue and a monk. Nice break in - no problems, no deaths. But one cleric kept healing the chanter in my group - even tho he was not even hit (this makes me nervous too - I don't suck that much as a cleric that I would need back up healing of a druid and a cleric on a PoF raid /cry!)  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif . At the end he was oom or lom after fights (I was fm because I not even had to heal the Chanter ;b) and we had to wait till he recovered. How do you say this your fellow cleric whithout sounding arrogant or without making him feel bad?<br />
<br />

Calling out every heal is not to make the tanks happy but to save other clerics mana. Nothing is less mana efficent than 3 cleric casting divine light on the same target. And thank goodness for the alt channels--start a cleric channel!!!!! These help not only with heal info but speed up possible no drop loot issues, group issues, who is doing which rez, group aego, whatever. <br />
My advice to your fellow OOM cleric --- toss him a tell reminding him that said chanter has (if he doesnt why not?) Rune up (or epic rune) so he doesnt need a quick heal right off the bat.  This will calm your fellow cleric and likely save him popping a remedy or whatever the first time he sees a chanter targeted off reverse assist. Good luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daku inochi</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shera..  here's how I would handle that situation from the last line in your post.<br />
<br />
<br />
Me:  Heya, bud... are you using a manaless heal on my chanter? If so.. wow!!<br />
Over_Healing_Cleric:  No, I'm using Remedy.<br />
Me:  Oh.. I didn't notice he was injured.. maybe I was getting health-bar lag.  Did you notice who was hitting him?<br />
<br />
Now.. here's where my crystal ball starts to fade, so let's look at a few possible answers to that question:<br />
<br />
OHC:  No one was hitting him but I thought he could use the extra healing.<br />
Me: Would you mind if I setup a hotkey to alert you when I need the extra healing on him?  That way you can keep an eye on the main tanks and don't have to waste mana. &lt;Grin&gt;<br />
<br />
or.....<br />
<br />
OHC: I didn't want him to die.. he's my friend and I told him I'd take care of him.<br />
Me: Ahh.. gotcha.. would you mind if I took over that role for a bit?  Besides, I wouldn't mind making a new chanter friend! &lt;grin&gt;  If I screw up then you can take it back over.  Deal?<br />
<br />
or....<br />
<br />
OHC:  I didn't have anyone else to heal during that fight.<br />
Me:   Want to try nuking a bit, then?  I'm suggesting that only cause I noticed you were LOM last couple of fights and I was almost full.  And if the guild bard finds that out that I'm FM and you're not, yer gonna make ME look like a slacker.  &lt;ahaha&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
In each case you can make your point by using wit and indirect suggestions as to what that other healer should be doing.  And you let them save face by backing out of the over-healing role honorably.<br />
<br />
Call me a diplomat. &lt;grin&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShelseaDruid</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my thoughts on it...  But you have to call out heals on raids, because if someone is ASSIST healing you may not have to waste mana by doing it also.  I am of the belief the simpler the better in called out heals. ie DL on %T, CHEAL ON %T - not %T Feel the Heal in 10 Secs<br />
<br />
Separate channels do not work well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">05-02-2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Typically in our raids we have hot keys to call out which heals we are using when we are healing someone not in our group or the main cleric healing the main tank.<br />
<br />
This way everyone assumes you are taking care of your own group (cuts down on some excess noise) but lets you know if your heal is needed on the main tank or when you will not need to heal a specific person because someone else did.</div></div><hr />
