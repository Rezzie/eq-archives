<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lanolar</div><div class="date">07-31-2004, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crimson Tempest (www.crimsontempest.info) is a high-end guild. We raid 5-6 days a week on EST time. Our raids generally are from 7:30-until. We are looking for hardcore players (cleric's mainly atm) that desire to see the end zones in Everquest. If you want to experience it all then maybe we are the guild for you. Currently CT's primary focus is on the Gates of Discord expansion. We are progessing through Txevu atm. Potential recruits should have all expansions enabled and be willing to log on and work at obtaining the flags necessary to raid with the guild. <br />
<br />
What we will be expecting from you during/after recruitment: <br />
<br />
* Dedication: If you can not give us your all while playing the game, then Crimson Tempest is definitely not the guild for you. <br />
* Loyalty: We expect our members to log on ready to raid for the Team. That means logging in and giving 100% on raids that will have little benefit except as a guild goal. If you can not do this, then Crimson Tempest is not for you. <br />
<br />
We will gladly consider cross-server apps. Please if you are interested, post on our recruitment area on our forums.</div></div><hr />

Crimson Tempest is filled with dedicated, skilled players who know how to have fun and get stuff accomplished at the same time. We have a great healer crew (I love our clerics AND druids alike *gasp*), but with a couple of us having to play less lately (I am about to have a baby), we could use a few more solid clerics to make our way to Tacvi.</div></div><hr />
