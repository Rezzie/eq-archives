(for those who don't want to bother trying to figure out what that said, I'll repeat...<br />
Rathgar, could you please use punctuation in your messages? It is rather annoying trying to read a giant run-on sentence. Sarcasm provided as a free service.)<br />
<br />
Mlar does have a valid bitch...lower-level tanks will get their butts handed to them in situations like this. It is in the group's and the healer's best interests to try to keep the riff-raff out. You don't have to like it, if you want you can walk in and demand your group gets a turn in rotation...see how long you'd last in that situation. (Just don't be surprised to be begging for rezzes soon after.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">04-25-2000, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think both sides have valid viewpoints.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, if there are many who want in and noone has been waiting longer than others, the group has the right to choose which class/level/person they feel is the greatest asset to the group.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if a person wants in and has waited patiently for a spot, they should be given a chance to show what they can do.<br />
<br />
In situation two, if the person turns out to be a drain on the group, then they should be willing to step aside.  If, for instance, this 38 warrior turns out of be a liability to the group, they should be willing to leave and allow a more suitable replacement to step in.  More likely than not this would not be handled well, but it could be if we could all just respect each other.</div></div><hr />
