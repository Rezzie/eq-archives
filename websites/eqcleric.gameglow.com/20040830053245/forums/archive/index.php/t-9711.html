<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">10-30-1999, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there I am, brand new in Mistmoore, grouping with some folks about my level (25) and having a blast. We kill some guy with a shield. People go nuts. <br />
<br />
&quot;YAY A Mistmoore Shield! They sell for big plat&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? How much&quot; I ask, and this Druid guy in the guild.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes from 400 to 600 plat&quot; they say.<br />
<br />
While we are deciding to either random it off or sell it and split the proceeds, the Druid fellow loots the shield, runs off and camps. <br />
<br />
I am SO DARN ANGRY I WANTED TO DUEL HIM. (25 levels, never once wanted to, and besides, my guild doesnt allow it)<br />
<br />
ARRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHH!!!<br />
<br />
No, Im not putting the name of the guy up here, because I *guess* theres a chance that his PC self destructed or his modem melted down or his ISP took a Tomohawk missle up the router, but I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Im so depressed.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
Already told my guild.<br />
<br />
Theres sometimes when I really wish I played on Rallos Zek.<br />

Feh!<br />

<br />
My group was once hunting in Cazic Thule in the Tae area, and we grouped with an unknown necro (named SAGGOLF). She didn't say much, but seemed to do ok with DoT's and such. Well, after a while she disappears for a minute, and then before we knew it the group that had been camping the stone golem upstairs was screaming at us. Saggolf had kill-stolen their golem, grabbed the rubi, gated and logged and we were left with the blame.<br />
<br />
Well, one thing I have learned is that reputation means a lot more at higher levels. People like this will have a very hard time finding groups or getting aid when they really need it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raefin</div><div class="date">11-03-1999, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The same sort of thing happened to my group in Unrest. we were camping the knight and before we even went up there it was stated that we would get tunics for the members that needed it. (group was 3 clerics, a warrior, monk and wizard) So after about an hour or so we get the knight kill the knight and the wizard quick loots and we all get trained so zone out. In the hallway we ask what the loot was wizard says tunic, we random the thing and it goes to the monk. the monk says give it to one of the clerics without one. The wizard says lets sell it and split he money. We all say no give it to the cleric. The wizard then goes ld. we wait around and he comes back we say again give the tunic to the cleric and the wizard goes ld again and doesnt return. Well Eisgowen (the wizard) returns the next day and we say the cleric is still online you can give her her tunic now. He says he sold it and that he never agreed to the random. So we say then give us our share of the sale price. Ld again and thats the last i talked to him. Some people are just jerks I guess. But i think by naming them on forums like this it allows for people to know who to group with and who not to. BTW we got 2 more tunics that night for the rest of the clerics so it didnt matter much.<br />

Alliliel, that's horrible! &amp;lt;big hug&amp;gt;  Its one of the reasons why I rarely group with people I don't know anymore, or that a friend hasn't recommended.  Tell me his name in game and I'll let my guild and all my other friends know not to group with him!<br />

He also abandoned us as soon as he looted (midfight with a hag and the bartender and several skellies) and I and 2 others died.<br />
<br />
then he logged immediately and kept the loot...<br />
<br />
very annoying</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">11-05-1999, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How glad am I? Darn glad.<br />
<br />
As a follow-up to my previous posting, I have to tell you that this Druid fellow was verbally harassed so much from the other group members, that he paid up!<br />
<br />
Each of us got 40 plat. I was pretty happy with that.<br />
<br />
So I'm glad that this guy paid us, and I'm glad that I didn't put his name up here since he has redeemed himself.<br />

Make a macro. People won't tolerate that crap. If someone steals from me...the whole zone and half of Norrath knows it. <br />
<br />
One guy stole a Rubicite BP from a friend of mine once...we and several others spent a week or two telling the whole server about him. Needless to say...after a few months I haven't seen his character that stole the bp.</div></div><hr />

All PC interaction went away and the offender was hopping mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katrin</div><div class="date">11-09-1999, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we all have had that happen to us or friends. However, I fail to see the difference in that and Eddystop (Eddysport?)'s ideas about getting the cleric armor items. Go read his method of getting the item off Babbinsbort in Befallen under the quest forums. Because it is an approximate eight hour spawn time he thinks it is ok to come back every eight hours when the mob should spawn and take it even if someone is there waiting for the mob. &quot;No, I'm not spending 24/7 camping for an item, I'm at the head of the line because I am high enough in level to take it away from you&quot; is his attitude.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />
