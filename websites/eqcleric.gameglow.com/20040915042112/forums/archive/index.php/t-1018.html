I don't farm these items but if I happen by and say regis is up, I'm gonna kill him. Also you can do things like run around lower guk and take spawns that arn't camped and sell the items as well. When I was level 44-50 I solo'd specs in OOT and Oasis and made about 200pp a night while leveling which isn't bad. I think it's all a matter of saving every scrap of cash to buy the first bag. After the first one you can pack a lot of FS and heavy items around to sell back to vendors. Another good place is burning woods, the giants there drop crap items that are worth quite a bit to vendors.<br />

Also sell spare crap, etc. Some of us were also level 50 for seveal months before RoK, some of us for almost a year, so we had lots of time to build up gear, heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanar</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't bought a new item since I completed my gold armour quests (well, maybe a rebreather/aqualung thingy...you know...the one with charges)<br />
<br />
I am still saving up to get my first tinkerer's bag at level 50.  Mind you, I am far to generous to my guild.  I could have bought a bag or two if I had sold the items instead of giving them to the guild.<br />
<br />
As most clerics, my major cost is buying the reagents for naltron.<br />
<br />
One day, I will be able to buy that elusive tinkerer's bag.  The only reason I want one is the fact that I don't have one.<br />
<br />
I still use a savant's cap, since I have not wanted to pay the prices for an extra 2 wis.<br />
<br />
Eventually, I will find something better than a BI medallion, but that is when I find it myself.<br />
<br />
Essentially, I prefer to get the items myself.  I know that I had a lot of help from the guild with getting my full set of gold armour, but at least, I felt some sense of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
This is my own way of doing things.  Generally, I am happy with my mainly gold armour (except for purple arms at last - my first piece of purple armour).  The items I wear do not make me a greater risk to the party.<br />
<br />
Not all high level clerics have a lot of tinkerer's bags. (I still feel odd calling myself high level, but I suppose I am now)<br />

<br />
I have one Tinkerer's bag, obtained at level 53 after saving all plat since level 45.<br />
<br />
Not looting, rolling on items, or accepting donations for resses puts huge dents in my pocketbook. Fortunately my guildmates give me items to sell to cover the 100+ peridots per night we use.<br />

I'm thinking I should get a tink bag or 2 someday.  The last time I tried to follow my map of how to get to the gnome vendor, I had to gate out with 5 extremely green gobbies tried to poke their nasty little poking sticks into me.  <br />

I had the same problem! I had to get a friend to show me the way. By the way, if you get SOW in Lavastorm and then RUN through SolA, the goblins won't attack.<br />
<br />
If you have sound effects turned on, listen for the ticking of the gnomish clockworks, and you'll know you are getting close.<br />
<br />
Another note on tinkerer's bags... the absolute lowest price is 5250 plat. Make sure you bring all your CHA gear, and have Enchanter or Shamen CHA buffs. Excellent faction with &quot;Solusek Mining Company&quot; doesn't hurt either. (Generally, people have good faction with this from killing kobolds in SolB, unless you've been camping CGS's or something.)<br />

I'm assuming the only vendor in all of Norrath who sells tink bags is the guy near Gabbie in sol. a?<br />
