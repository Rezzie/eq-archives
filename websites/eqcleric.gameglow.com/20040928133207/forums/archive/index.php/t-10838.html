The only time we've been there is to Succor through to Western Wastes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">05-04-2001, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny, I was planning on going there also to go Siren hunting.  I have hunted there several times but I did the front entrance part killign seahorses and that right tower.  Wasnt bad but the trains of death sucked.  I have been told if you really want to Siren hunt you want to start out on the WW side.  Planning on trying it out Monday.<br />

<br />
1. Some of the MOBs are un-mezzable.<br />
2. Lots of Complete Healers in the zone.<br />
3. Highly magic resistant MOBs.<br />
4. and what I consider to be the worst problem - creatures that run transition from the land to the water, making nukes, etc to finish them off a royal pain.<br />
<br />
That being said, it's good exp and can be a fun alternative to a normal exp grind.<br />

<br />
The CS entrance is pretty good once you break the 3 static spawns there (enchanter with dictate is VERY handy here). Seahorses do not follow or agro out of the water (one of the few places where the water problem plays to your advantage).<br />
<br />
Lots of quest gems drop here. Good for Kael/SS/Thurgadin armor.<br />
<br />
Sirens are enchanters and can AE mes and charm so get that MR up.<br />
<br />
It can be a very fun zone. Just get that MR up.<br />
<br />
Btw, if you need an EB item, the seahorses occasionally drop a fishing pole with EB.<br />

<br />
We romped through there, pulled a couple named mobs, got a few silver and copper pieces. You can camp the zonelines for gmes but there are better places to do that.<br />

<br />
Exp is decent as well. I think it's a fun zone, and rare that anyone is there, besides just passing through.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-06-2001, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have spent a fair amount of time in this zone (half a dozen trips or so).<br />
<br />
-&gt; Boanerges, all Clerics (walrus men) are white, but not all white walrus men are Clerics.  I &quot;think&quot; it's the Molkors that are Clerics.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Have never seen a Siren mez or charm, I think they took that out.  They are tough enough without it (managed to slow my SK when he was at 180 MR).<br />
<br />
-&gt; Icy Servants are a bitch.  Their AE range is huge (so watch pets on pulls), and do AE cold and dispell.  Also hit for 360.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Mobs in this zone run and many cannot be snared so consider that when you're fighting.  Also, some will dive into the water (walrus men, Siren's gate) so also consider where you are fighting.  Bash and stuns work where snare and root won't.<br />
<br />
-&gt; The seahorses aren't too tough (although they are a pain for tanks, they constantly summon and keeping in combat range is a hassle) and occasionally drop decent items, although by the time you can fight here well you probably won't want the items =P.  For example, in addition to the EB fishing pole (primary only, not a weapon) they drop a nice bracer (8 AC, stats, low weight, good for Monks) and that Ancient Seahorse Cloak (AC 20, +25 HPs, weighs a ton).  I traded a cloak to a Ranger for an Idol of the Thorned.<br />
<br />
-&gt; The zone in is not a tough break anymore, just make sure you have a good tank and an Enchanter/Bard.  The zone in mobs are always mez'able now.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Evac'ing/Succoring across to fight is a lot easier if you're after XP and gems.  Of course if you're after XP go somewhere else =P.<br />
