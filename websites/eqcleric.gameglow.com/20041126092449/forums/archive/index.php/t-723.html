<br />
&quot;We actually made a mistake at one point, giving group resolution after group heroism. I'm not sure how that happened, but rather than shift the spells back to where they should be, we're actually going to replace one of the spells. I'm mentioning this to illustrate how important it is that we provide spells at the level which they are provided.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abashi stats that they are going to replace one of these spells (heroic bonds and united resolve).<br />
<br />
This opens up for speculation of course. I interpret &quot;replace one of the spells&quot; that we get a new spell instead of either of these two (probably united resolve). Maybe they would consider lowering united resolve to level 51 and letting heroic bonds stay at level 52? We'll see what happens. A new spell would indeed be fun though.<br />

Yet another example of Abashi's methods.  Say &quot;No, it isn't broken&quot; until he actually figures out that all the people saying that it's wrong are actually correct.<br />
<br />
What a putz.<br />

A week ago we found Group Symbol in the Test Server spdat ... I wonder what will replace United Resolve since it is now useless!</div></div><hr />
