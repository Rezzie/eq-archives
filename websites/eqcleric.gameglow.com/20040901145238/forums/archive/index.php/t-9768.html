<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vervain</div><div class="date">11-30-1999, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More of a whine than a rant, but I'm just back from vacation and feeling that way...<br />
<br />
OK, so maybe I'm not the first to notice this, but I frequently group with a mage and I've noticed a couple of things about their spell components.<br />
<br />
1) They're cheap<br />
2) They stay cheap<br />
<br />
Elementals (with one level's exception) cost a whopping 5 silver and 200 mana to cast.  I'd LOVE to be able to cast a 1200 HP buff cum damage shield for that kind of cost.  Or better yet, since we're the masters of healing (like they are of summoning) make Superior and Complete Heal cost the same mana as Greater Heal.  Or even just make all rezzes cost only 200 mana.  I'd like that.<br />
<br />
Their armour spells take Cat's Eye (2gp or so), either one, two, or three of them at higher levels.  And, since they can't be cast on others, they only have to carry enough for them.  Meanwhile, I'm stuck looking forward from Jasper (8.5 gp/each) to Periodot (at 115 gp/each) for my 44th level spells.  And I'm expected to toss these around like Hallow'een  candy.<br />
<br />
To recap, they get an increase in spell effectiveness every spell level for either zero cost (elementals) or a couple of gold increase.  I have to carry (now, at level 40) about 350gp worth of stones on me (40 jasper)  and soon (level 44) I'll be carrying around probably 2500gp worth (20 periodot, 20 jasper).  Now I know everyone says pp doesn't matter at higher levels, but I'm 40th and I'm not there yet (she says, looking at her November Bank of Norrath statement with the &quot;month-end balance 1200pp&quot; line on the bottom).  Wah.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for letting me get that out of my system.<br />

<br />
P.S. Oh yeah, they can (at higher levels) summon zero-weight 6-slot large bags at the drop of a hat (or helm, or fine steel mace), so they don't have to worry about hoarding coppers (or destroying them when overweight).<br />
<br />
P.P.S Yeah, I know research is expensive, but I donate all my words to my mage.  When was the last time your local mage gave you a stack of Jasper?<br />
<br />
P.P.P.S.  OK, it's really out now.  I hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kurdun Wheystone</div><div class="date">11-30-1999, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try this.<br />
<br />
Most folks I know travel with a pretty regular group. SOME folks I know travel with a set-in-stone don't bother me I'm finely balanced and tuned group (not naming any names here). Make them supply their own stones.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not saying &quot;trade me a stone for a cast&quot;, but inform your regulars that hey, yer not exactly rich, and you can't afford to cast yer symbols about like candy. A stack of 10 or 20 bloodstones from a tank I regularly keep alive ensures him that he'll be getting Symbol'd whenever I have any stones. He prolly gets about a 3x1 return on his investment - but the fact that he donates any at all puts him high on my list and dispells any &quot;problems&quot; I might have at throwing 6g at him every 15 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for those that may be a bit, ahem, CHA challenged, have that pansy high elf enchanter buy yer stones in bulk next time they're selling that 5000p plat veil to some sucker. A gold here and there adds up pretty quick.</div></div><hr />

No one I have grouped with has had a problem with this method. But then again, I don't cast it unless we are going into some really hard battle or are running low on group members.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course I tell them I am taking it off the top. Like I said though, I RARELY use symbol.<br />
<br />
Skimming it off the top is certainly more fair than telling the tanks to bring their own stones!</div></div><hr />

Mostly by selling words, runes, or bronze armor the group doesn't want and keeping the remainder of the splits I can cover my costs of symbols, pinzarn anyway. I only use the peridot one for FG's and such. <br />
<br />
Most tanks seem to want symbol whether the area is real difficult or not though. Warriors particularly are hit point nuts.<br />

I have never had a problem with a group giving me a larger chunk of the loot so that I can cover regent costs, even non guild groups.<br />
Oh, if you think a stack of 20 jaspers and 20 periodots will get you anywhere, think again. When I load up, I get 180 jaspers and 40 periodots, lasts a few days at most, heh, but I am symbol freek. Everyone in my groups gets a minimum of resolution and symbol of pinzarm, tanks get shield of words casters get it too if its a real tough fight, resistance buffs handed out as per the situation. I just refilled my regent bag, I now have a grand total of 50 plat, not like I have anything else to spend it on though.... heh<br />

Next time we grouped, the Shadow Knight handed me a stack of 10 Cat's eye agates and said, &quot;Buff me!&quot;. So he got buffed. The time after that the Troll Warrior did the same. I always keep at least 5 on me for emergencies, but I usually don't have to buy any.<br />

2) I've found the secret to keeping a little cash around.<br />
3) I've learned something about my new Symbol.<br />
<br />
OK Naltron for a Peridot isn't worth the 10.5pp.<br />
<br />
It only adds 150HP more or so at L45 and if DOES last twice as long (almost a RL hour).  but it's still 5x as expensive as Pinzarn.  Unless it's a situation where I think that 150HP will save someone (and that's one round with a Bloodthirsty) I'll stick to Pinzarn.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">01-05-2000, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played a mage and a cleric both to level 31 so I think I can give some perspective here. (For the record, the mage was my first character, and my current character is the cleric.)<br />
<br />
I think it's a good thing that mage pets are cheap as dirt. Unlike a cleric's symbol, a magician is utterly dependent on their pets in many situations throughout most of their levels. Symbols are icing on the cake for a great set of protective wards at the cleric's disposal.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, pets path BADLY. No, thats a mistake. Pets path HORRIBLY. You want that pet to be cheap - that way the mage doesn't hesitate to let it go when it decides to path the long/wrong way around in a nasty dungeon. Symbols don't train green mobs all over your party. Symbols don't path. Maybe it would be equivalent if the extra symbol HP was randomly variable over time and decided to go negative on a whim, but it doesn't.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, symbols are consistent. You'll always get the same amount of HP buff on a symbol, it will always last the same amount of time. Symbols don't disappear or commit suicide when the cleric dies or zones. Symbols don't commit suicide when the cleric goes invisible, or invisible to undead. Symbols don't decide to sometimes be way below the level of effectiveness it's supposed to be. The cost of the symbol pays for this predictibility and it's worth it. Maybe that top-level 12pp symbol is a little pricey, but the 1pp symbol is still quite useful at level 50 (I reckon, not having been to level 50) even if it's not the absolute best you can cast. <br />
<br />
As long as you're not wasteful with your symbols, and use your judgement as to when is appropriate to use them, they won't bankrupt you. What else can you really spend money on at the higher levels? The only things I've spent cash on from level 24-31 are jewelery, bloodstones, food/water (since I'm too lazy to conjure), and newbies. The latter two don't cost very much. And I haven't gotten less jewelery because of the cost of symbol gems.</div></div><hr />

My wife (42 paly) always has nal up when she is with me (hey she's my wife :P) and I will normally penz the puller.  The makes getting back into my heal range a bit easyer if he overpulls and it he gets rooted gives me a bit more time to get close enough to him for a heal.  Talk about making a tank/puller trust u, have him stand there rooted to the ground with couple of Dars beating on him..he thinkin he dead for sure just as that super heal hits him......makes for BIG smiles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arss Rubybone</div><div class="date">01-22-2000, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what i've been doing lately...<br />
<br />
Symbol of Pinzarm (mid level symbol)= Dam good spell as good or better that Valor<br />
<br />
I purchase 40 jaspers and take them to the dungeon of my choice.  I always cast on the main puller, sometimes on the secondary tank, and when in very difficult areas everyone including my self.<br />
<br />
Then u make sure u get ur share of the loot - this is hard in the L20's (when ur blind)but gets easier in L30's. You must walk out of that dungeon with &amp;lt;at least&amp;gt; the amount of plat it takes to replace the jaspers and buy food/water when u come back for more fighting.  Turn off auto split loot.<br />
<br />
The results are several fold. First u will not have to heal as much and u will be able to med. Second members will die less often and maybe to ur surprize not at all.  Third watch your exp bar move.  Fourth when ur group starts noticing that you are the one keeping them alive they will expect u to loot.<br />
<br />
Lately i have been noticing that the Symbol Pinzarm is more important than having Endure spells up.</div></div><hr />
