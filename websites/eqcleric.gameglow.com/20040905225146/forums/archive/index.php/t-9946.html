<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent much of yesterday in EC buying/selling a few things. I owe a friend 550pp for buying me Donal's vambraces, so I was trying to unload some stuff. <br />
<br />
Someone comes up to me, looks at the nice little book I have in my primary hand, and asks, are you selling that spirit tome?<br />
<br />
No, I am not selling my spirit tome. The reason I am not selling it is because I use it. It gives me 6 more WIS. Everyone needs more WIS, including me, since I only have 171. If I wanted to sell it, I'd go, &quot;/auc Selling spirit tome!&quot;. <br />
<br />
I didn't say that.. I just said I wasn't interested in selling it at the moment.<br />
<br />
Later that day, a druid comes up to me, and asks to inspect me. Sure, I say. She inspects me, and asks how much it would take to part with my spirit tome. <br />
<br />
I tell her it will take a lot of money to part with it.. and she disappears after that.<br />
<br />
If I wasn't in EC, I wouldn't mind too much. However, I am in my server's main auction zone, and I think it is safe to say if someone is not selling it over /auc... then they're not selling it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
A suggestion for you,  this is what I did you know that box where you can leave a message when people inspect you...<br />
<br />
I bascially wrote a message saying &quot;Im Im wearing it, its not for sale so dont bother wasting your time asking.<br />
<br />
<br />
I only use that message though when I know Im going to spend a few hours or so trading/selling in East commons (which I dont do to often)<br />
<br />
<br />
When out hunting and so forth my usual message in that box is &quot;Fright shouts..  Wall of Ogres!!!&quot;  ^-^ personal joke between a few friends  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Drives me nuts.  Some things are just not hard to spell right.<br />

ARGH.<br />
<br />
Wish I could sell my spirit tome tho, been<br />
on a mule for about a month.  Hehe.  Remember when they were 2KPP.  Make a quick run to Kaesora on the way to Sebilis for a nice extra chunk of change.  ;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering I bought mine for 450pp... it would probably take 2k for someone to convince me to sell it!<br />
<br />
Actually.. I did find somewhat of a solution... put it away and have my blackjack in my hand. No one ever asks to buy that  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Plus I can easily whack on spiders and cats in EC to find silk/pelts  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheLu10nt</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost the same thing with my monk... i have a new personal record...<br />
<br />
Five times in ONE hour, I was asked, by 5 people...<br />
<br />
&quot;may i inspect?&quot;<br />
&quot;how much you want for your trance stick?&quot;<br />
<br />
(Yes, i use a Master Wu's Trance Stick in my Primary hand)<br />
<br />
One even said...<br />
&quot;Come on... i'll give you 1 blackjack and 200pp!!! your a rip off!&quot; (After telling him becuase i WEAR it, and USE it i increase the price by 2k (They sell for 2k-3k on Cazic-Thule))<br />
<br />
HATE when people inspect me, and /tell 'How much for *item* i'll give you *price*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wastral Utterblight</div><div class="date">11-27-2001, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, once I walked into EC and came out nearly naked! I just have trouble saying no when people want my stuff so bad. And what really sucks is the only people who ever want my crappy equipment are the ones who dont have any cash to buy it. All the rich people have things three times better than mine on thier alts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burrwin</div><div class="date">11-28-2001, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, running through WC...not EC...with my monk long ago.<br />
<br />
someone: &quot;hey you have a fighting baton&quot;<br />
/who someone<br />
someone, 42nd level pally<br />
/r: &quot;yes&quot;<br />
someone: &quot;how much?&quot;<br />
/r: &quot;how much what?&quot;<br />
someone: &quot;how much you want for it?&quot;<br />
/r: &quot;its my primary weapon.  it would take a lot for me to sell it, since I don't have anything else near as fast&quot;<br />
someone: &quot;I'll buy for 200&quot;<br />
/r: &quot;lol&quot;<br />
<br />
He continued to harangue me all the way from WC to NRO near the Oasis zone line when I finally /ignored him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deakin Phrost</div><div class="date">11-29-2001, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the deal:<br />
<br />
EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE!<br />
<br />
yep... thats the cold hard truth... the only consideration is the price...<br />
<br />
To the original poster:  If that guy that wanted your spirit tome offered you 5k plat fr your spirit tome, would you not sell it and buy something better?  or maybe it would take 10k?  The point is... If someone were to offer you enough money you'd sell it... hence it is &quot;for sale&quot;... of course, its up to YOU how much its worth to sell it, and if after a polite refusal of the 500pp offered for it, the person continues to hassle you to sell, then you tell them to bugger off, or /ignore them  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Just because someone isn't advertising to sell something, doesn't mean it can't be purchased  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  It usually means you have to pay more than market value, but it can still be had  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
there you have my 2cp  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Instead you get the &quot;I'll give you a yak for ur mace plz&quot; dingdongs that follow you around the zone constantly spam-inspecting you.<br />
<br />
I wish there was an /action that was /slaps upside the head with her epic.<br />
