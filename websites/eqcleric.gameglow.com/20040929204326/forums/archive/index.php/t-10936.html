We regularily take down Vind/Statue/Rhag and stuff....  but the queen handed us our maximuses twice in a row last night. /cry<br />
<br />
It seems like the queen's AE now includes some kind of knock back.  Our tactic of pinning her to the wall doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Can you good folks post your queen pulling/fighting tactics that you are using these days since she was buffed a bit.  We like to fight her in her room because she gates.<br />
<br />
Last two things that worked for us was having Bard harmonize queen, pull some guards.  Rinse repeat until she's almost alone.  Then have enchanter go invis pretarget some mobs for mez.  DA person runs in, positions queen in a good spot and everyone changes in.  Mobs mezzed, Queen killed, end of the story.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ShelseaDruid</div><div class="date">03-04-2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been on countless failed raids to take out this Queen.  The ones I have seen work, monk pulls out extras and we kill in King Room.  Sacrifical Paladin throws up DB to take the first AE and then rush it - clerics stay in the hallway.<br />
<br />
A method I heard has worked using a non-KoS person.  A monk pulls the whole room and FD's.  The non-kos person hails the queen.  The queen will answer and the others go back to the places.  Raids attacks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">varthdadur</div><div class="date">03-07-2002, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only killed her once.  We pulled her to the king room and then had 3 mage fire pets beat her up while 2 clerics healed and everyone else watched.  I think I CH'd twice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perplex</div><div class="date">03-08-2002, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to lack of patience, we usually use the brute force approach to this one.<br />
<br />
What we do is invis up, and go into her room fully popped, tanks positioned around her, casters near the door and outside AE range. <br />
<br />
MA first drops invis, everyone Disc/Nuke the crap out of her right off the bat while chanters deal with the guards. Clerics use either group CHs or word of restoration. She dies pretty fast with all hell being released on her. After she's dead, deal with the mezzed guards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qamen</div><div class="date">03-09-2002, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild will use this method:<br />
<br />
First find all of the enchanter (3 or more) invis up, and come down to the queen's room (all mob can't see invis  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif). Then enchanters mark up which queen's guard which they will mez. After all confirmed, call all ppl invis up and come down. Find a brave pally(must die :lol) go to queen's platform, when he open his DA up, all enchanter mez their mark up guard at same time. Finally all people open offensive and CHARGE !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">03-14-2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the advice.  We went back to the old tried and true way of doing it and cut down the huge number of people we took, and it worked out just fine.<br />
<br />
1) dispatched King and his guards quickly<br />
2) Had level 60 bard lull the queen<br />
3) pulled some guards (3-4 came)<br />
4) invisible enchanters pretarget remaining mobs<br />
5) Had paladin run in and DA behind the queen<br />
6) Everyone runs in and massively zergs.  Everyone nukes, even clerics.  Casters stay at the doorway (no ae).<br />
<br />
We had 0 deaths.  Our first queen raid with absolutely no deaths!<br />
<br />
I even stunned her once!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphyr</div><div class="date">03-17-2002, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of sending a suicide paladin, send in a level 49 magician fire pet... It will hold her in the room just fine, it will get her to fire off her first AE with nobody else in the room, and it is immune to the AE so it lives long enough for the other people to charge in after the initial AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">03-20-2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our suicide Paladin didn't have the decency to die.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  He survived the battle just fine.  But the pet idea is excellent.</div></div><hr />
