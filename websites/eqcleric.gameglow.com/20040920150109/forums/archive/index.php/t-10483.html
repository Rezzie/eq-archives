Most kills are close calls and you have to be carefull of the minos, at 22 a few are blu and half are green that will atack you. Best to go grab one spawn point when theres a few low lvs hunting minos. Keeps them off your back. Also make sure you have endure magic and start castying smite b4 it has a chance so summon pet, asap after it spawns. Few seconds hesitation and it will have a pet up. Yeah its risky, havent died yet, few close calls but solo the exp is rocking in at 1/8-1/4 a bub a kill. And with spawn every 6 min my exp is HAULING</div></div><hr />

I have a few caster friends that I may have to bring along with me! At least until I hit 24 or so!<br />

I would like to go, but If I need to wait for someone to camp Minos there also, I may just find greener pastures.<br />

It was a ball.  If you get a Druid, 2 Wizzy's and of course a cleric you can make a killing.  <br />
<br />
Our strategy was to get the eyes before they made pets and buffed themselves.  Therefore, the second the eye spawns, I would hit it with Holy Might and the Wizzy’s and the Druid would cast their best DD spells.  If it is a regular eye it’s dead.  If it’s a lord, you need to go the 2nd round, but this is OK as it’s stunned from your Holy Might spell     http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif.  Only about 1 in 5 eyes ever got a spell off before they died, these were the ones that resisted Holy Might.<br />
<br />
In the 16 hours we killed about 150 Evil Eyes, but only picked up 3 PBBs     http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif, but we made 4.5 bubbles of XP each with about 180pp profit, putting me on 24th     http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend this zone.<br />
