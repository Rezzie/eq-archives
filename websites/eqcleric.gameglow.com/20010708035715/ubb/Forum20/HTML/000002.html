</FONT><HR><BR>     It seems like everyweek I read another thread on the General Forum with questions about Chardok Overking, but within a week the last thread is several pages down and a new one takes its place.<P>     I've been on several Nobles raids myself with varying degrees of success, and I know there are a lot of folks out there who have either not done Overking yet, or have tried several times and failed.  As such, I'd like to open up discussion on what's worked for you in the past and what hasn't.<P><BR>     So, I'll kick things off with a list of information I've found to be useful.<P>1.  If you have problems taking down the Prince, don't even bother with Overking.  I'd suggest making the Prince your "benchmark".  If your raid group can't kill him with only a handful of deaths, consider the Overking and Queen definately out of your reach.<P>2.  Expect the unexpected on any Nobles raids.  It is completely likely and possible that due to strange pathing and aggro issues it could take hours to even get down to Overking.  Make sure the folks on the raid are aware of this and have time to stick around.<P>3.  I suggest having a Gating Class (who's bound right outside Chardok) and a CotH'ing mage camped in Safe Hall unless you're very experienced with Noble's raiding.  CR can be VERY ugly.  At the very least make it clear that CotH'ing Mages _and_ Clerics _and_ Gating classes should attempt to camp out in the event things go terribly wrong.  <P>4.  In the past when I've been successful killing King this is how we did it:  Clear from Safe hall to the Library, move everyone to the Library.  Clear from Library to Herbalist room, move everyone to Herbalist room.  Clear the Royal Guards to Herbalist--until there as few Guards left with consideration to their respawn.  After he's down to just a few guards and himself, charge the room.<P>5.  When charging the room, DO NOT FIGHT HIM IN HIS PIT.  Have a monk or a tank class aggro him completely out of the pit.  He WILL cast grav flux and aggro the rooms above.  If you decide not to fight him in his room, be very careful about aggro from the Herbalist room.  It you have a raid group of 30 or more and want to pull Overking outside of his room, then leave one group in the Herbalist area to control repop there.<P>6.  It is very helpful to have a CotH'ing Mage in pull team.  Pullers can often fall through pit traps while pulling.<P>7.  When fighting in the safe hall, tell folks not to fight anything on the stairs or push mobs into the wall.<P>8.  If your raid group is moving while invisible, make sure and remind everyone that if they become visible they are to die in place--and that NO ONE Should drop invis to try and help.  Get to where your going and have someone drag him into camp.<P>9.  When Fighting Overking, do not expect to be able to get him solo.  Just go in with the expectation that he may have several friends with him that will need to be taken care of.  Please note one very important thing:  You must have sufficient numbers of enchanters so that at least ONE survives the entire fight.  Remember, Overking may die but you still have to keep things under control long enough for the appropriate cleric to loot.<P>10.  MOST IMPORTANT:  Determine who is going to be looting the epic drops BEFORE you fight the mob.  It seems fairly common on Overking raids to manage to kill Overking and then everyone be wiped out by his guards and the random extra aggros.  <P>11.  Remember, quantity is not nearly important as quality.  It is much better to have 24 55+ than 48 50's.  LD's are a real issue to contend with.<P><BR>     Ok, that's all I can think of for now.  These are just things I've noticed in the past, and I'd like this to be kind of a discussion.  So if you have things to add, or if some of my advice above is incorrect or misleading, please post a follow up.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>--<BR>Ethel Etana<BR>54th Super Vicar!<BR>Immortal Vision - Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Keeping a group in Herbalist is a good idea. Especially if their cleric already has an epic.<P>Remember to have casters burn him down at the end or else he can CH himself.<P>Now for the Queen...<P>Queen makes the King look like a pansy. She's a shaman BUT her primary attack is an AE song that does 1800 dmg over like 2 or 3 ticks. It's nasty.<P>The main way to kill her is to get her solo. Then park fire pets at the end of the hallway. Pick one tank (preferably a level 60 warrior) to be the tank. Buff him out the wazoo, major attention to MR and FR. The tank then goes and pulls the Queen off the puller and back to the fire pets. <P>You will need a group of clerics standing by themselves, preferably with a CoH mage to try and keep agro down. CH the warrior at regular intervals.<P>I haven't tried this method since the healing agro changes so it may not be viable anymore but it is worth a shot still for the warrior epic (too bad she only drops blade 40% of the time  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"> ).<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Actually the times I've been with groups that successfully killed the Queen we used very different tactics then Boanerges mentions.  Actually killed her sunday night/afternoon and we loaded up on RF stuff and buffed HP max.  We had between 4 and 5 groups and the key is mostly to get her solo.  After that the actual fight was all melee people charge, all casters stay out of AE (it's relatively small) and the clerics stay with melee people and use AE healing.  She isn't particuarly magic resistant so the casters just try and burn like mad (she might be fire resistant...not sure on that).  One thing I will say is her AE is not only the nasty DoT, but it has a small knock back effect that will interupt casting.  I died 20 seconds into the fight (maybe longer...hard to say) without ever getting a heal off because I timed my 2 group heals poorly and she got an AE off right before I could cast so I got disrupted.  But even with that, by the time I finished zoning from death, she was dead.  So it isn't a very long fight if you concentrate attacks on her, and you can keep casters out of the AE so they stay alive to nuke and get your group heals off for the tanks.<P>Dalain Brightgleam<BR>High Priest of Marr<BR>Bristlebane server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hi there.<BR>Been doing Chardok for almost a month now, every weekend saturday and sunday, and i hope next weekend will be my last. Just a couple of things i would like to add...<P>You have to pace yourself. You cannot go to slow through the royals, as the respawn time is quite high, but rushing can have disasters as well. Make sure everyone knows what not to do (i.e. fall down the hole =/).<P>On the Queen, i have tried to kill her and failed most time but we did take her down once. From what i was told, she only has 18k hp compared to 32k on the king. Her resists are also quite low according to the wizards as most of their nukes hit for full with little to no resists. The time we killed her, we got her resists way down, mages shammies and chanters key here. Then throw all the stuns you can at her. Although she isn't that tough, her dmg output it so high she will wipe everyone out way too fast. Its almost like an AE deathtouch at times. Mages are key, and wizards for the high dmg output. <BR>All i can add, hopefully next weekend is my last chardok raid<P>------------------<BR>Ailen Goldenfire<BR>Cleric of the Council of Arcana<BR>Quellious<BR>"A fool think himself wise, but a wise man knows himself a fool."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Once you get the strat down, the Queen is  as easy as the King. Clear as many of her guards as possible, buff melee and cleric hps as high as you can get them, and make sure you have a couple wizards and rogues. It is possible to resist the queen's AE, apparently, but resist gear is not a big concern.<P>Once everyone is ready, melees and clerics charge the queen, the object is to keep her on her platform, as far to the back as possible. <P>Clerics chain cast word of vigor starting immediately. If you have enough clerics, double them up in melee groups, and have one do nothing until about 30 seconds in, when they're to start chain casting the same AE heals. <P>Melee's should use offensive disciplines like quad damage, as defensive really doesn't help much here.<P>As soon as the queen hits ~60%, every caster nukes/lifetaps/whatever. This includes shamans and enchanters who aren't busy mezzing extra guards.<P>The Queen should drop in 30 to 45 seconds. If she doesn't, your group wasn't high enough level, or she aggro'd the cleric grouped with your rogues.<P>The Queen's hps are somewhere in the 15-20k range, and her spell resists are pretty awful. Once your goal becomes 'deal 20k damage as quickly as possible' instead of 'stay alive long enough to deal 20k of damage' she's really not a problem.<P>Aiien.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well, most agree she's a shaman BUT her AE is a bard song, not a spell (I'm not kidding, it's listed in the spdat.ef file as a song). This is confirmed by the fact that even if you move out of her radius it lasts one more tick and one more tick only. If it were a true DoT it would show up in your buff lists (fight Rumbleroot in poG sometime and you'll see what I mean)<P>Royals definitely do not conform to any known classes really (unless you know of a wizard than can CH).

</FONT><HR>I'll toss in some thoughts. I've lead Chardok Royal's 4 times and been on 4 or 5 other runs now. Killed Queen twice, once with three deaths, other was not so pretty, several total wipeouts. All about strategy on her.<P>Here is what I do.<P>My Primary Rule for all raids/runs - the Pull Team will make or break your run.<P>I go in with a break down group about 2 hours prior to run starting, and I break down to outside the start of the royals. Monk, shaman, warrior, mage, enchanter, cleric is my normal break down team, although lots of times I'll have other people there along for the ride that showed up early and work on snares and playin around.<P>Once outside the royals castle, invis and run to stairs. CotH people down and get everyone grouped up. 3 of the 4 runs I've used, I set it up for AE strategy. Each time I've had 30-40 people, 10-14 AEers (druids/mages/wizzies) and 3-5 enchanters. <P>Once at stairs, test your team for LDs. Pull the two from the hallway and AE them. If your AE is set, pull the library and AE it and get down there. I use AE on any pull that has 3 or more sarnaks. Got 3+? Smash em with AE and continue. Very very effecient.<P>Get everyone lev'd/DMF'd and clear the herb room while that's goin on. Once herb room and hallway to King is cleared of pats, move groups through one group at a time to the corner beyond the fake wall.<P>Now I just have my pull team clear the kings room. Never has my team not been able to get the king solo when we move to the corner. Several times I've seen people fight in the library and get wiped out. And, my pull team (57 monk, 59 shaman, 56 cleric, 59 enchanter, 60 warrior plus one other, in this case a rogue) has been with me on about 30 raids I've lead, so we work pretty well together.<P>Once you have the King solo, make sure your people are ready, pull him to the corner. I send in my 59 and 60 warriors on him. I've been lucky enough to have a couple on my last few runs. Last run I had 3 level 60 warriors. Have them in different groups and your good to go. Send them in and let them tank for about 10-15 seconds, then blast the king outta the water. Unless you have a 60 mage/shaman there for Malo/Mala, don't worry about slow/tash, I've not gotten one to stick at 59 in about 10 kings that I can recall.<P>Next is Queen. As mentioned before, the strategy here is to "Deal 20k damage as quickly as possible", and not "stay alive long enough to deal 20k damage". If the queen is alive for more than 45 seconds once you engage, you are all dead. <P>My strategy - monk clears room. I do NOT take queen with mobs still up. You got approx 2 hours between Kings anyways, so you can take your time. If you rush it, you will all die 95% of the time. <P>Monk can pull mobs out of queens room into back of Kings room. While the queen is in the back of the room with the monk (alot of times chewing on his corpse), mobs will wander back out. Pull them as you can. If queen comes, your peeler stays and dies unless you can CotH him back soon enough. This will kill your monk alot as half the stuff here are casters, tough to FD these guys. I had two monks working together last time for more effeciency. One monk getting rid of rez effects, other one pulls.<P>Once Queen's room is clear....well, gets tough here with the new healing changes. Last attempt I did was the 1 for 1 healing change, which is modified again so next time should have better results.<P>I usually buff my top warriors up to the max, rune em, and send them in. Nail her to the wall. Let them tank for 1 round of AE, then send other melee in. Everyone that can nuke, nukes for all they got outside AE range. <P>FYI - her AE is around 1800 damage, reducable with FR, and goes off about every 12 seconds. Extremely nasty. It's range isn't super large tho. Last time we took her, she agro'd the clerics so we scrabled in the room. Most were down but we finished her off. She was in the middle of the room and I was on her platform nuking and wasn't getting hit with AE. Finally got a blade on that one...heh.<P>Should be better now with healing modifications, we'll see in a couple weeks.<P>Oh, one thing I forgot to mention. I always have the rogue sit the fights out. The Rogue in my pull team never fights. Not once we're to the corner. His primary function in life is to stay alive and give me updates. He's a scout, and a CR man if necessary. I also always *always* have some cleric at the stairs either camped out or sitting there. I don't recommend having a full group there as they can get ansy and try to pull the two sarnaks in the room. Without a shaman and/or enchanter (which you need with you for AE stuns and helping with slows), one group doing those can get hairy (I did this once and my CR tgeam all died...lol).<P>Dats about it. Fun stuff, although it's cost me a fortune in coffins to figure it out. =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well I'm getting alot of pointers here from you guys, I've only done King raid twice so far , both times it went well until we got to the part where we were splitting the king room. My first mistake was not assigning 1 group to hold the herbalist. We were doing well splitting the king, until the pull group's cleric healed the puller before we FD'd and at that point we weren't wise enough to camp out a rogue and cleric in the safe hall. We had a total wipeout because we got the king and all his guards. The second time we did very well also we fought down, we got to the corner just thru the fake wall. Then we sent a rogue and cleric back to the safe hall. The rogue got grav fluxed and killed so we had to wait for him to run back, CoH him and have him log again. When we were finally ready, I hadn't been paying attention and some mages had fire pets up, well when the puller was splitting, the king's AOE hit the pets, they ran in , presto , the whole king room again.<BR>So lessons I learned, no pets, always have a cr team camped out in the safe hall. Hopefully will kill the King this weekend or next week.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>My guild successfully killed the king this weekend for the first time, with maybe 2 deaths.  We decided to pull him to the library, which for the most part worked really well.  The first thing we did was space the herbalist room, then proceeded to split the king room.  When we pulled the king, we got 2 adds that were easily mesed.  Enchanters sieved all his mana, so he had none to gate/cheal, but another thing that we tried was the put ALL melees on one side of him to push him around the room to prevent casting.  On mobs 55+ you can't stun them to prevent casting, you have to physically move them.  We also attempted him with only 24 people to keep the lag down.  On the king pull, we moved a CR team into the safe hall, to keep it clear, as well as to be a 'last resort' if the king was almost dead.  The only problem, was when the king was at a sliver of health, he made a dash for the zone literally.  He wasn't strolling, he RAN and we almost ended up with a huge train on us.  Our CR team knocked him down just before he hit the stairs otw towards the prince.  Moral of the story, don't be afraid to pull him, just make sure you are constantly pushing him around, and make sure he doesn't get stuck on a wall or in a corner, or he will for sure gate on you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>My guild used to get pasted by the queen until recent few months.<P>The tactics we device are as follows.<P>Have enchanters use improved invis and each choose a target to mez during the fight.<P>we get a number of sks to invis up and stand next to the queen, everyone else stands outside.<P>Sk signal they starting.  They all harm touch the queen, enchanters immediately start to mez.  Everyone else rushes in (casters get into range of casting only) and starts to chain nuke and all the tanks use high damage discs.<P>Doubling up clerics is a good idea.  Only time i have survived is when I had rune 5 on and was with another cleric.<P>The trick being maintain agro so that the queen does not run around alot.  The sk's produce significant agro early on so that she doesn't budge (allowing casters to nuke from the get go).  Clerics jump on platform, wait for first ae dot message and then start chain word of restoration as much as they can.  By the second word of restoration the queen will forget every other person in the room and start to chew the clerics, hence doubling them up is as much to keep the clerics alive as it is to keep the tanks alive.  Note having mobs not mezzed can be deadly.
