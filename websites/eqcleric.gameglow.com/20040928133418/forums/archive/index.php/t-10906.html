<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiien</div><div class="date">10-19-2001, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What're people's thoughts on killing Ventani and releasing Kerafym? My guild plans on killing Ventani this weekend, but if possible, we plan on leaving one of the first 2 warders up. Unfortunately, the other Sleeper's capable guild on the server plans on taking out all three before we can make our attempt. We plan on going ahead with our plans and killing Ventani, but this means no more warders for anyone. <br />
<br />
Now, in a situation like this, who would you blame? I'm pretty sure we'll get the blame and I can see how that could be justified, but I also think it's awfully selfish of the other guild to kill the first three before we can make our attempt and deprive us of the chance to take down Ventani while still leaving him up for others to try later.<br />
<br />
We're going to go ahead and release the Sleeper if it comes down to it, and personally, I'm prepared for people to be angry with us, but shouldn't the other guild involved share some of the blame?<br />

<br />
i know after the sleeper is awakened that he goes on his multi-zone rampage killing everything....<br />
<br />
but then what? are the warders reset? does the sleeper go back to sleep the next patch? is the Sleepers Tomb &quot;done&quot; after the sleeper is awakened? (ie. no respawned warders, etc...) if the sleeper is not put back to sleep, what happens to him? and what, if any ramifications happen (long term) because the sleeper was awakened?<br />
<br />
lots of questions i know..... but any additional insight would be appreciated<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Basically, freeing the Sleeper removes resistance stones, dragon masks, sceptres of destruction, gnome masks and a bunch of crap from the game, although the sceptres and masks are tradeable, so there'll still be ways to get them. <br />

But I personally wouldn't suggest it. Just relax and take it slow. Farm Ventani for a few weeks; have you seen that monk robe? When you feel that you've used Ventani to his max potential, go ahead and kill him and enjoy the script. But don't do anything premature; trust me, once you wake the sleeper, killed vyemm/vulak a few dozen times, etc, and you'll find there's nothing else to do but farm farm farm ntov, you'll wish you kept Ventani alive for a decent fight every week.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiien</div><div class="date">10-20-2001, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the problem is the other guild is most likely going to make sure the other three die as they pop until they're capable of taking down Ventani, so we're never going to get a shot at Ventani if we take it slow.<br />

I dont know how your servers politics works - but I reckon it could be an option if its not too filled with hatred.<br />

Simple as that really.. if they don't agree, its their own fault.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiien</div><div class="date">10-20-2001, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our server politics are pretty much non-existent. The other guild has said they're planning on making sure warders 1 to 3 are dead, entirely for the purpose of making us the bad guys if we kill Ventani. We're way beyond diplomacy.<br />

As an aside, how many clerics did other servers use for Ventani? Being that 5 clerics showing up for a raid for us is cause for celebration, I'm thinking we're going to have trouble with Ventani, who seems more like Zlexak than Vyemm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">10-21-2001, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aiien, what server are you on? The &quot;politics&quot; there sound almost exactly like Cazic-Thule.<br />
There is a guild, well alliance, on my server that intends to kill Ventani and release the sleeper, they have 80ish keys. My guild, well alliace, is the &quot;other sleepers capable guild&quot;, we have 32ish keys.<br />
 <br />
The difference is that it was made quite clear to us that they plan to wake the sleeper. I even have a nice log of a conversation that shows that one of the motives it to keep other guilds from catching up. =)<br />
<br />
My favorite thing about it is that their leadership has feed a public line that they asked us to leave a warder up. They never have, because its been their stated goal to trigger the script.<br />
<br />
So far they have failed, wich made all the tells of &quot;Tomorow the Sleeper awakes&quot; that I got from level 1 characters all the more amusing, heh. Wish people would at least have the guts to run their mouths using their real character names...<br />
<br />
Example of politics on Cazic-Thule. Main uber guild to other guild that can do sleepers: We will let you have free run of ST uncontested in exchange for one primal a week. If you don't comply, we take it every week and race you to other MOBs you do. (paraphrased, it was actually put much harsher, and had the threat stated before the &quot;offer&quot;).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing they are having cleric problems since I got this tell a couple of days ago.<br />

My opinion?  Go for it.  Who's to say you shouldn't kill a mob just so someone else can farm?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiien</div><div class="date">10-22-2001, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play on Terris, and I really have no idea why the politics are so screwed up. Up until about two months ago, the top 2 guilds got along okay, but lately everything's been falling apart.<br />
<br />
Apparently, my guild is a bunch of mercenary loot whores skilled only in zerging whereas they're a close knit 'family' group who rely on skill over numbers and don't really care about loot. On the other hand, we're a small, capable guild who gets by on skill instead of numbers and they're a bunch of elitist snobs better at whining than playing EQ.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like people in both guilds, and there's a few I dislike in both guilds. There's a ton of misconceptions about both guilds floating around, like our label as a zerg guild, when we have, at most, 65 active members and an average raid turnout of 40ish and their rep as a small, skilled guild when they claim over 100 active members. I'm not really sure which guild is more skilled, since our class balance is so different. We're heavy on wizards and necros and they're heavy on clerics, rogues and warriors. We have 6 active clerics to their 15 or so. We've got 8 active wizards to their 4. <br />
<br />
Anyways, some of the results of the fued are completely insane. We had a warrior in our guild who routinely told people he was only using us to increase the value of his account to sell on ebay and who'd only show up for raids where something he wanted dropped. He begged and bullied people into not going in for yelinak's head against him one day (we're on a dkp style system) and disbanded as soon as he got his GoDS. He's a total gimp and jerk who should have been kicked out of our guild months ago, but he managed to keep a low profile when he was around. <br />
<br />
So now, you'd think the other guild would listen to us when we tell them he's a selfish jerk, but because he quit our guild, he's automatically a hero to them. There's a running joke in our guild that all you have to do to get into the other one is apply to us and then withdraw the application because we're not nice. That's like instant tag from them.<br />
<br />
Both guilds seem completely incapable of being reasonable about anything, recently we were both in ToVN during a Vyemm attempt, and someone called a GM to invoke PnP. Both guilds managed to blame the other for the outcome, when we have no idea who it was that petitioned. It's just stupid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">10-23-2001, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I'm glad we released the Sleeper, it was a lot of fun and a great feeling of accomplishment.  That said there are a lot of items you will no longer be able to aquire in ST such as but not limited to:<br />
Gnome Mask<br />
Monk Robe<br />
Resistance Stones<br />
Sceptre of Destruction<br />
<br />
Primal Weapons still drop but as you know, the drop rate on the 3 named golems is piss poor at best.  There are some new quests available, but they are a pain in the ass requiring serveral weeks farming the 3 golems to complete it even once.<br />
