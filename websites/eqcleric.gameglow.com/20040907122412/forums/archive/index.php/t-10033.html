<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arynia</div><div class="date">08-13-2002, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I heard from a friend there was a petition going around about shortening the spawn length of Ragefire (epic quest) hoping that a shorter spawn would cut down on KSing and such.  I was just wondering if anyone had seen the petition and knew where I could sign it.  Had some friends camp him for 4 days and 2 other guilds (Phoenix Crusaders and Greylords) came in and thought they had more right to the camp because they had more people.  Could have cared less that another guild had been there for 4 days straight.  If any of you know where I can sign this petition plz send me an e-mail!!  booch3151@hotmail.com<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

As far as Ragefire is concerned, the blanket statement is &quot;We ain't changing it, deal with it.&quot;</div></div><hr />
