<br />
I have been soloing the undead gorillas in BW but the xp is kinda slow.  Any other decent solo spots with nice xp?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Diamante</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karrakk</div><div class="date">07-10-2001, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's where I soloed to 50, but after that I didn't do much more.  There are some undead in the combine area in Dreadlands... under the HUGE wizard spires that were blue at 53.  You might see about soloing there.<br />
<br />
Better xp would be a good group of friends, and go to the Hole.  xp there is unreal<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">07-12-2001, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or head to SolB and do bats and bugs.<br />
Mobs there are easy compared to those nasty rillas in BW. Even more if you grab a ranger/monk/rogue (pick one yourself).<br />
Did the SS area at 54 with a 56 monk - LDC's were lying around in piles and the xp flowing  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
And while you are in SolB, you can relative easily get a group if you like...<br />
<br />
But if you must solo, I have hunted undeads in Trak near the EJ zone. Some were still blue at 54.<br />
I teamed up with a SK and did the fear kite thingy. He snare, you scare  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
That was the only time I've used Turning of the Unnatural for anything usefull.</div></div><hr />

With a bit of margin. 1 bub of mana normally. They are pretty decent xp comparred to the Keepers.<br />
<br />
Good for when doing other stuff whilst medding. The Emeralds jungle zone is pretty safe to med at.<br />
