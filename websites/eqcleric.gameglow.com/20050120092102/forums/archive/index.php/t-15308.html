<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yar me's bored neh?<br />
<br />
 Okay-<br />
<br />
 Drunken Giant Ping Pong in near the druid rings in the commons...and living for over an hour while playing it.<br />
<br />
 Drunken Dwarf Death Dive off the Bird tower onto a GM (invul but freaking drunk)...scared her so bad too and seeing me get up and run back up (DB hehe) and do it again followed by 12 other dwarfs to do it again was priceless...the calls for the scoring and style...nothing beats a rolling run tumble and jump off the edge of a elevated platform to land at the feet of a gm...<br />
<br />
<br />
 Solving the Dwarven Ale Crisis in Kaladim (Gm event-done to fix the missing ale from metrchant lists- I blame tumpy still). And getting my Battle stein of Brell as a reward- (then losing it when I moved to TT sigh...)<br />
<br />
 Seeing my Diaries in game finally, and watching each and every moment as someone new read them for the first time and made one of my brews.<br />
<br />
 Battling the Icy Lizard wench at 39 (root potion) and fear healing chain on MT till only he and I were left- and with me OOM- Getting  the killing hit after a stun interupted her CH! Rezzing everyone after wasn't much fun either...<br />
<br />
  Halloween Kithicor revamp-- Roleplaying so well (and judiciously using DA n DB) that the GM running Innie was laughing so hard at my running commentary (good to be able to type and play at same time), that he mistyped my name several times in his attempts to slay me outright- &quot;C'mer Ye bowlegged sassanatch, n bend over so yes can kiss me mace, Ohh I see gonna be a cowards and play at being too tall to play wif us Dwarfs? Well Yer Toe's not too far from me reach! HAR Enjoy des Hangnail from Brell! &quot; etc etc...<br />
<br />
 Getting asked by both server gm and some devs to test the spawn at a certain graveyard to prove it was broken and send them the logs...funny how after 60 hours the logs didn't show the line dancing centaurs singing that bloddy Klippity Klop bop song...(dig up that old post if ye can find it- it's pure fun to read).<br />
<br />
 Getting asked by two of Bertox's Power guilds to help them recover corpses in Fear before they poofed and rotted...loosing lvls 49 48 47...to 46.5 to get them in and up...(that's after all my bodies were ressed too btw)<br />
<br />
 Reaching the final steps of the ORIGINAL UPHILL BOTH WAYS Cleric epic and camping the FG's with a mage friend and an occassionaly monk for 3 days...passing it off when I knew I couldn't stay up anymore to a grateful cleric I called up out of the blue.<br />
 then Getting a call by a power guild that he just had popped and dragging me and all that was left of my guild (Champions of Brell had just retired as a guild on our server -and had grateful gm's and players there RP'n the event) (CoB- was first guild to exist with same name on 3 seperate servers at once- Bertox, 7th Hammer, and TT). Suddenly having over 20 larger guilds send a rep to get me the Heart of Ragefire, 30-40 showed in 2 minutes of warning to me- I was summoned directly to stage somehow (grin). (Yah so I went LD right as I did turn in (and some tank overeagerly agroed rage to soon) and got back to eat a AOE and then touch heal everyone I could and get my loot...a 44 Warrior won cloak, both pants went to others too, I just claimed heart- even though I really coulda used the cloak too...the one NInja who decided to try to take the loot was summarily executed by gm staffers there (in player guise) Yah I know who's a gm on TT but I've been sworn to Dwarven Super secret honor pact and won't break me word for anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Lastly- one moment in the light for Brodder was when Rayne posted a collection of his Favorite posts by me on the front page for everyone to enjoy...kinda warmed me coddles it did...dankers Rayne.<br />
<br />
 Ohh and Dankers to all of ye about who've made the Cleric's life and trials in EQ somewhat bearable...<br />
<br />
:D :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">05-05-2003, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">couple other things...<br />
<br />
  Standing and getting ready for a trak raid and watching the dragon amble up and say &quot;Psst bring more dwarfs, dey always have lots of ale&quot; and challenging trak to a drink contest only to get &quot;Word&quot; slain after three drinks...Yah so the dragon cheated...<br />
<br />
<br />
  getting lemminged to death, by 200 n00bers during my running of the First SKunk Wars, and wondering if we'd over buffed the damn skunk we put the loot on...only to watch the youngsters have the time of their EQ life in a grand epic Battle with the overcharges and superspraying skunk and fight it honestly for 22 minutes - a lvl 15 who broke the rules of the event got Godsmacked and three other necros who complained too loud about my &quot;event&quot; ruining their gameplay and trying to fear train the n00bers getting a nice insta travel vacation to the coldest spot in Norrath- PRICELESS!!<br />
<br />
 Finding out afterwards that 11 of the 200 or so noobers in the pack were staffers at VI coming to a Brodder Event for the first time, just on word alone- also about 30 of the noobers were first day creations leveled to 5 just so they could join the fun (we had stacks and stacks and stacks of bonechips to help youngsters make the cut- cut off was lvl 10). <br />
<br />
 Doing the Madd Thanzit (Catch the madd gnome-aided by summoning to look like insta porting and gods' meddling) all over faydwer turning into a two day epic event for noobies was even more fun (we ran it again the next day since there were too many to run in it easily the first day).<br />
<br />
 And lastly- 23 Dwarfsand gnomes conquering first floor of Hate by ourselfs and then causing (we think) the first HATE nerf...well it did change immediately after our all Dwarf/gnome guild (no evil classes btw- ie necros) was able to conquer hate...<br />
<br />
 Being the only BattleCleric anyone took seriously on our server, and no one questioning his being evocation specialized...back when stuns did what stuns should do...mitigate damage...<br />
 Proof in the pudding being the Dwarf who kept two monks and a chanter alive after a wipe and camp call in hate, and tanking with a DS potion two rats, Ch'ng both monks, stunning and rooting the other mobs, until us four cleared the bad pull and ressed the rest of the healers before the camped clerics came back.<br />
 I tell ye, no none evocation specialized cleric coulda done that...I got regular invites after that... :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
In all of my times reading/posting on this board, Brodder, you definitely were the shinning star amongst all posters.<br />
<br />
I can't remember a post that you made, that didn't bring a tear to my eye (from laughter).<br />
<br />
I hope everything is going well for you my brother, and that one day soon again, we will hear/read another wonderful, side splitting post.<br />
<br />
/em lifts a large mug of Brell's finest in honor of Brother Brodder.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. I miss the druken cleric posts. I'll never forget the one about the guy in Hate who kept being attacked by rats and wanted to know why and you said &quot;Behold the power of cheese&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenlayen</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think in honour to one of the best clerics in the game SoE should create two new spells :p <br />
<br />
Brodders Blessed hangover cure <br />
<br />
So you can consume more alchol :)<br />
<br />
Brodders Drunken rampage <br />
<br />
Cast on Melees but make sure you don't have any mezzed adds in camp :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Damm some of those events sound fun ( shame I wasn't around to enjoy them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gniss Fleshmender</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always wondered about Brodder......<br />
<br />
I think the random dice like him, he's lived thru things that would shatter most warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He is dwarf, always drunk and making up new brewing combines, Brell loves him! And we all know Brell is all powerfull, why he survives mind you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skwar</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Brodder is only entertaining because he was a Halfie in a previous life. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gniss yah I have, but that was when stuns actually worked like advertised.<br />
 Tis a funny thing to fight a horde of gobbers in Old Runnyeye, taking out the Orbs and deep gobbers of old - then zoning out hurt and dying to a bloody bixie...man That was one death I almost never lived down...<br />
<br />
 Only to find out it was a chanter's ex pet that had gotten super buffed then the chanter zoned...<br />
 Only fair to say the same chanter asked me for a rez inside Runnyeye (same train I brought up) as I lay dead outside to his pet.  :D <br />
<br />
 Blackburrow trains getting whacked by me n another cleric usign chain AOE stun and Aoe dmg spells alternating , then cleaning up on loot...we hired a young druid to run to town to sell stuff, and we armed every noober and pet that we could reach too...(we were lvl 25 at time)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Kunark- COM keeping MT and pull monk alive during early endless golem kills n respawns...Myself and two other dwarf clerics were last ones up beside MT and pull monk...we ended up rezzing and mod rodding to low health (near agro levels) for over 25 minutes...then fighting for another 30 minutes before the spawn chain broke...also nailed a Ninja looting lvl 25 rogue that day too...<br />
 It's nice to have your name recognized back then on Appeal queues and get immediate action by our server's gm...to have your bugs actually escalated and acted upon...<br />
<br />
<br />
 Then there are days you log in drunk (IRL and in Game) and sit to med up and a damn willowisp kills you while yer afk recycling yer ale into elven amber light wine... :eek: <br />
<br />
<br />
 Worst day...when 3 days after my diaries came out a group from a well known poer guild decided to prank me...and told everyone I was a GM now and  Brodder was a quest NPC who's AI would take him all over, and even rez you nomatter where you were if you knew the secret phrase...Bastards! ;) <br />
 <br />
 Had to wait for a server wide announcement that NO I wasn't on VI staff...please stop bugging him for rezzes...the actual npc is XXXX use /tell BRell's Beer beats Elven Wine every time! To get his attention and follow the dialogue for the NPC XXXXX's Services...<br />
<br />
  :D   revenge is sweet...<br />
<br />
 OI and getting my Summon ale necklace...OY yah dat rocked too...<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Brodder, I have an idea :)<br />
I always thought it would be neat to get all the clerics from EQcleric together on 1 server for some sort of event (and no cleric strikes this time ;)) So after reading your post here, I was thinking, what if you hosted an event for all us clerics?:) Give us a chance to all get together and meet up for once, and to partake in the infamous Brodder events :)  It doesnt' have to be anything big, could do that giant skunk encounter again, but if you're up for it I'll leave all that part up to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nozok</div><div class="date">05-06-2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been lurking on these boards forever, and Brodder's posts have always been the highlight for me.<br />
<br />
Me and the boys in The Holy Harbinger in Thurgadin even canonized Brodder at some point during a particularly long, 28 Keg Mass for Brell.<br />
<br />
Hail Saint Brodder! and thanks for the inspiration!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cannonized...<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
 Well 28's a start  ;) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Advert</div><div class="date">05-07-2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What can I say another Brodder post :)<br />
<br />
