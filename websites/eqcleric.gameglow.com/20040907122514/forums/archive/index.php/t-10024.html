When I am waiting on the GFay wizspire for the port up, I usualy do a /ooc buffing at wiz spire till port up - some come, and I give them HB and SoW - but recently I find myself having conversations like this:<br />
<br />
Megabashur tells you:'Hi'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'Hiya  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'Can I get Agro?'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'Agro?' (of course I know what he means, but I like being cruel sometimes :b)<br />
Megabashur tells you:'Yeah, that buff you got'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'I don't have an Agro buff'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'That good one, you know?'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'Do you mean Aego?'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'Yeah that it'<br />
/w Megabashur<br />
[18 warrior] Megabashur (Ogre)<br />
You tell Megabashur:'I am sorry I can't cast it on you, you are too low level'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'That ok, I take group one'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'uhm... if you give me 35 kpp I will go, buy that spell and most gladly cast it on you'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'I not have 35kpp'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'Neither do I'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'You not have spell??'<br />
You tell Megabashur:'Nope  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif'<br />
Megabashur tells you:'You suxx0r'<br />
<br />
Hehe I get more and more people under 20 asking me for Aego - this somehow makes me feel less bad not having that spell  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

and most of the requests are like this...<br />
&quot;buff me plz&quot; or a person hails ye and stands in front of ye saying nothing until ye hail back and then ask for aego.<br />
<br />
And most of the time they dont even offer peris for the aego.<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
but i feel more sorry for the chanters and shamans, at least i dont get harrassed and get followed for buffs.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

I think actually I would be very very cruel to give lvl 1 beggars an Ulthork Hide Tunic...   especially now when they respawn at their bindpoint WITH their gear on.... /grin<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cobra101</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 02:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The big misconception here is that these guys are &quot;noobs&quot;<br />
<br />
I find that almost all the beggars I come across - for cash or buffs or whatever - know exactly the price of everything. In the early days (once I was no longer a &quot;noob&quot; myself  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif) I would sometimes give them something that would have pleased a real newbie only to have it thrown back at me as &quot;vendor junk&quot;.<br />
<br />
So that Ulthork Tunic stunt, amusing as it might be, would probably not catch the right people.</div></div><hr />

Maybe 10x the entire 59 levels I went to roleplay.  I never use anon - I want my guild to be able to find me.  Since turning 60, I've been asked for aego more than I used to get asked for rez.  It costs me MORE mana then rez AND 10.5p to cast but they ask for it like it is nothing.  When I told one he was too low he replied with &quot;not for the group one&quot; and I was just stunned.  He wanted me to use 60 percent of my mana and 4 peris to buff him so he could PL faster?  I just don't get it.  I've started using roleplay as a defense now.  I hate it though.  I feel like I'm hiding and I shouldn't have to.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't do that - i am just too weak  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif- only thing I do is ask for a dot or 10pp if I cast symbol/aego on them - and if I am in a good mood - I group up with some lowbies/newbies and cast naltrons mark on them<br />

If I'm in a good mood I do the group and cast HB, otherwise just reso.<br />
If they can't settle with that, then fine by me. I could group and dispell them or just /ignore.<br />

If I were to group aego a lowbie then least I would expect were the 4 peris.</div></div><hr />

It really is no different, a random person asking you for aego or a random person asking you for 10.5pp. I treat the requests as such.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Finine</div><div class="date">07-21-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that I get asked a lot of questions when I am in Felwithe (now that I have faithstone, I port there for my peris).  Usually it is young clerics who want to ask a question about where to find a certain spell, or how a spell works.<br />
<br />
Just the other day, I had this conversation with a little druid, which for some reason I found quite amusing. I was actually pretty stumped by her question because I really have no idea where level 6 druids get their armor LOL(leaving out the names to protect the innocent)<br />
<br />
Level_06_druid tells you, 'can you please tell me where you can get something for your back?'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'uh, i dont really know?'<br />
Level_06_druid tells you, 'and shoulders?'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'no clue hon'<br />
Level_06_druid tells you, 'I thut you where lv 53'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'well yeah but i haver armor from plane of hate'<br />
Players on EverQuest:<br />
---------------------------<br />
[6 Druid] Level_06_druid (Wood Elf)<br />
There is 1 player in Felwithe.<br />
Level_06_druid tells you, 'like what type?'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'and the rest is crafted by guild mates'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'well you have to be level 46 to get there, and it's cleric-only'<br />
Level_06_druid tells you, 'where you going?'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'your best bet for now is to save up and buy some leather armor from a vendor'<br />
You told Level_06_druid, 'to a guild raid'<br />
Level_06_druid tells you, 'ok'<br />

I told him that it will use 4 peridots (42pp) and 2000 mana - I said 50 pp would cover the costs but I would pay more likely  80-100pp for it because 2000 mana is quite a lot. <br />
<br />
Now that I got my spell, thats about the amount I will ask from someone who wants me to cast it on him.<br />
