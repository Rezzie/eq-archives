</FONT><HR>ok just so not all the stories are bad =)<P>I had just started playing, when my wife wanted me to take her character to Qeynos (we were in Gfay, and only 1 account)(the character in question was an eighth level mage).  I researched a little, and begged for binds the whole way through (I knew I wasn't gonna get a TP, why try).  Got through Kith at 2AM, how I'll never know, now.  Got bound in Rivervale, got through HHP, which was very heavily camped at the time, was traveling down the ramp in EK, got to the first tower, and something was spawned in there!  It immediately aggros, stuns, and knocks me off the side.<BR>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<BR>Zone into kith, decide to cut that little corner of the zone, get aggroed by some kind of knight, think maybe I got lucky when he didn't immediately chase.  I apparently got just far enough away to not be able to see the casting he was doing.<BR>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<BR>Ride high on the wall in Kith, middle of the day (taking no chances), get through HHP, zone into EK, realize that the map on EQatlas is total crap, and start asking if anyone has seen my corpse.<BR>Immediately get 2 tells, I explain what I was doing when I died (the first time), get a tell back after about 2 minutes - "don't move"<BR>and I'm standing at my corpse, a 60 cleric standing over me, with a 60 mage right beside.  I say thanks, but that wasn't enough for them ).  They tell me that they have to buff me now, and that I need to empty out an inventory slot for the bag that the mage is gonna give me.<P>remember - this is after playing the game for about 2 weeks.<P>I'm soon buffed out the wazzoo, with a bag full of toys from the mage.  they even take the time to tell me the best ways to go through NK and WK.<P>I made my cleric the next day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The very worst CR/Resses ever for me.  Before level 60's level 50 was the max.   Fear was the target, 2 now non existant guilds make a try to break fear.   Mobs use to get bugged at the portal and slayed everyone in both guilds at zonin.  We didn't know this then.  Most logged into "zoning please wait."  So they Call for assistance, I'm in the next groups.  10 groups, all level 45-50 zone in.  The ones that didn't go LD died to the bugged mobs.   4 more attempts were made, we had about 300 corpses in zone.   The only redeaming factor to this was, fear never used to repop after a patch for 12 hours.  <P>We had a patch the next day.    <P>The lamest ress I've had, was Hey i'll give you 100 plat to run over and ress me in XXX zone.  I'm one zone away and at a camp, I say I'm busy try to find another cleric.  2 hours later get another tell, no luck on a cleric could I bug you.  <P>I am feeling bad for him, so I run over there, lost my camp in the process.   Ress him, he tells me he doesn't have the money on him, can I ress his other 2 corpses 3 more zones away at a portal/wizard TP for the money. <P>WTF is wrong with people, do they think tricking clerics gets them somewhere?<P>My favorite request was, I'm in sebilis D2, I get a request from a level 30 guy.  Could you ress me, I'm in hell level and I need help.  I say, "where is that?" He says," Rathe Mountains."   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I'm not anon obviously since he found me out of the blue with who all cleric.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ah the thread that never dies. My worst yet was when I was playing one of my other characters in Great Divide at one of the Kodiak caves in a pick up group, average level of the group is 35.<P>A couple of people leave and we're down to four in the group, things get a bit rough and the tank runs for Velks, the bard stays behind doing crowd control when the rest of the group have already run, I follow the others. I'd told the bard to get out of the cave and above where there was a zone but either he was being valiant or he didnt know where the zone was and dies.<P>I felt sorry for him so I'm spamming gsay asking him what happened, no reply for ages. We zone back out and he's in the zone and finally responds to me. I tell him not to loot all on his body and that I'll run my cleric down from Luclin to come res him and could the group save my spot.<P>So I log and log in my cleric, level 52, not anon. Once I'm logged in I send the bard a tell, I'm on my way. As Im waiting for the portal to GD to activate I send the bard a tell and let him know how long until the portal goes off. When I arrive in GD I send him a third tell, I'm in the zone and will brt. This has taken around 15 minutes at this point. Now I get a reply 'Oh, what lvl res?'. I reply that it'll be a 49 res. 'Oh, u have ur epic?'. No, I reply. 'Well I got a guildie w epic comming to res'. I reply, You didnt think to tell me this?. 'I was zoning' he says. Bull! I think, he was in the zone when I logged off my other character and I've sent him three tells over 15 minutes. I sent you three tells since I logged on, you missed them all? I ask. No reply. So I /ooc to the zone that I hope my group is ok and that I'll be back with my other character shortly and sit and start to camp. 'What %res is 49?' He tells me. Too late, I reply.<P>Gah!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, after last night, decided to post about 2 of my experiences.<P>1- Met this druid in GF while shopping.  We are just acquaintances, never group together, say hello once in a while.  I'm preparing with a group to go into CoM & I get a tell from him asking if I can rez him in EJ.  Since I'm in EJ, I say sure, bring corpse to CoM zone.  He actually has 2 corpses.  About 15 min later the first one arrives.  He has trouble finding the 2nd one.  I tell him politely that I will rez the one that is here but my group is ready to head in & I'm not going to keep them waiting.  Rez done.  A couple weeks/month later, he sends me another tell from one of his alts.  Please come rez this alt before my corpse poofs.  His alt was like lev 15 or something & he was bound on another continent.  Unfortunately, I was already on the move with a group to our hunting spot.  I tell him I can't & he goes off a major tyrade about how everyone uses his druid character & refuses to help him.  Not once, have I ever received/asked for a port from this guy and being a 50+ druid, he should have gotten his alt bound a bit closer.<P>2- Just happened last night.  Was hunting in Ten Mts with 2 friends.  We have a guild hunt in Nurga later in the week.  We wrap things up & stop by in DL to drop off the ranger, then the druid & I are porting elsewhere to do our banking, etc & log for the evening.  No sooner do we land in DL, someone shoots me a tell asking me to rez him & 2 or 3 others out near KC.  I tell him, I'm sorry I can't - I'm just passing thru.  He tells me it will take only 3 mins, etc.  I tell him again, sorry I can't.  We port away.  Then I get multiple tells from the guy about how when he's high enough he will make sure that no group in Seb or any other zone will take me - he knows my name now & he has alts - then tell ME he's gonna put me on ignore.  Go figure - just a rude individual.<P>People like this frustrate you when you go out of your way to rez on a pretty regular basis.  /shrug<P><P>------------------<BR>Nyfeara Panacea<BR>Officer of the Blades of Light<BR>50th Cleric of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ok this one stumped me last night.  I am not sure whether to laugh or cry.<P>I was just coming out of Kaladim with new spells for hitting 49 when I get a tell from a guy who had to have used /who all clerics. He asks me if I could rez him and I ask him where he is.  He proceedes to tell me that he is in the Oasis but will have the group druid pick me up from the bbm druid circle.<P>Well I am not doing anything in particular so I figure why not.  I head over to the bbm rings and wait for the druid whom it seems takes forever to mem the spell and get over here.  After the pick up we head to south Ro and then to the Oasis.<P>We get to the guy and I ask where his corpse is.  He tells me it is in Cobalt Scar but don't worry he won't mind having to go back there when I rez him.  This confused me some and I ask him why he didn't tell me it was a lot further away then the Oasis when I asked him?  He proceeded to ask why it mattered, he is here standing in front of me who cares where his corpse is.<P>Hmmm.<P>Well first I explain that if I could just rez by clicking on your live body why didn't you come to bbm instead of sending a druid to pick me up and run me to you.  And that to rez I must click on the body.<P>All to find out that this is a level 54 Paladin.  If what he said worked he could have clicked himself and rezed.<P>Thankfully the guy was decently polite.  He stood there a second and I could just hear the brain a grinding.<P>After another minute or so of inactivity I told him I was sorry that I couldn't do anything but was hoping I could get a tele back to bbm.  So there I was teleported back to bbm and just shacking my head in wonder about how any level 54 Paladin wouldn't know how to conduct a simple rez.  And secondly how a druid of at least porting level had no clue either.<P>I just hope they bought the characters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I died running through Kith one night.  I'm bound in WK.  I'm sitting at bride in WK and get sent a tell asking me to rez them at such and such a loc.  I'm not that great a locs, but I start out, looking for them.<P>In the meantime, the friend I was running with found someone to rez my own body in Kith.  I tell the person asking for a rez that I'm sorry, but I could not find them in time.<P>I get rez'd, and the person asking for a rez starts harassing me about not giving them a rez.  I finally gate back to NK to rez him just to shut him up.  Went out of my way an hour just because I'm too nice.<P>Turns out, this guy was in HK, and zones closer than I was to my desitnation.  He never even said thank you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just a side note.<P>I think it is more impolite to leave your group to do a rez than it is to turn someone down for a rez.<P>The only bad rez experiences I can remember are the one where I have to go a great distance only to get there and the person is already rezzed.  Yup, that torques me.<P>And, if you turn down my level 49 rez once, it is turned down.  Don't ask me 15 minutes later.<P>I usually accept donations for rezzes, but don't get upset if I don't get one.  If the rez was a pain, I would be angered for no donation, but I can't think of a time this happened.<P>As for that druid in the hole, I would have never made it to Tox.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with you about some of those guys are just complete idiots.  But I avoid all of that with a set of rules.  Some exceptions to rules will also be posted.<BR>I am 56th so I have the 96% rez finally and no epic.<P>1) I *Never* leave my group to go rez someone<BR>   (exception of a guild member)<P>2) If I'm on free time and they are in my guild or allianced to my guild they get priority rez. (I wont leave group to rez a member of a guild allianced to mine, they should have their own clerics)<P>3) If it's a stranger I tell them I take donations but it isn't necessary.  I will only go up to 2-3 zones away from me. (I will not go through a dungeon for someone)<P>4) I immediatly tell them they *MUST* have someone drag their body to zone-line or I will not rez them.<P>5) Whenever someone starts getting upset and curses me, I immediatly take a screenshot of text and send it to their guild's officers and leader, I also IMMEDIATLY let my guild know so they will no longer help that guild until the issue is resolved.<P>6) Sometimes I will take a day off and do rezzes for 100pp per body.  The rules to this method is they must port me there and back when done, someone must drag their corpse to zone-line.  Once again if they do not compensate you, repeat rule number 5.<P>I hope this helps you.  I love being a cleric.  I have ABSOLUTELY no problems anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000263-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000263.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000263&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000263&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
