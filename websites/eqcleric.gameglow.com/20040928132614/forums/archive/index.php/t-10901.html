<br />
Would anyone out there be kind enough to give a few cleric-strategy hints for Howling Stone? I'm going in for the first time this weekend, and was hoping to garner as much info. as I can on how healers operate best in the zone.<br />
<br />
This request comes off of doing my first Kedge Raid last week, where I discovered, quickly and painfully that the seahorses in the lower levels just absolutely *hate* when you cast remedy! Hoping to avoid such snafoos this time if possible.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<br />
At all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Move along. It's a bad zone. You don't want to come here.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean it.<br />
<br />
Feh. Ok. Fine. It's great. There I said it. <br />
<br />
Basically the thing you have to worry about as a cleric is there are a LOT of mobs that harm touch.  Good pulling is key, and healing will be important since the HTs can be 600-700 points.  Some rooms the cleric gets to pull! You hit divine aura, walk in, and take all the harm touches, and then the enchanter mezzes some of the mobs.<br />
<br />
And watch out for the rug traps.<br />
<br />
A good group can do great here. But there is the potential for a long, painful CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">09-04-2001, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spent 2 hours in it last night.<br />
<br />
My one group cleared South and East wings, meeting our untimely<br />
death at the hands of one Drusella Sathir.  Well, that's not true, we<br />
met our deaths at the hands of her friends, after killing her and about<br />
half of them.  Got to see THIS incredible scenario tho (from memory):<br />
<br />
You begin to cast Divine Aura<br />
You take some obscene amount of damage<br />
You are knocked unconscious<br />
You regain Consciousness<br />
You regain your concentration and continue casting<br />
You cannot cast while you are invulnerable (didn't know it had worked).<br />
You are Summoned, You are knocked unconscious (don't ask how)<br />
You regain consciousness<br />
A party member says 'Lord Gryf'<br />
You are smacked around for some amount (at a sliver at this point)<br />
You are Slain by a Mortiferous Protector<br />
<br />
It all started after I managed to throw Celestial Healing on the Chanter, <br />
Bard and Rogue, then managed to channel a complete Heal on the main<br />
Tank.  The chanter died soon afterwards, as did everyone else, but not<br />
until DS went down, dropped the Rod of Oblations, and one of the two<br />
Rogues managed to use his Thurgadin Gate potion while the Bard kept<br />
the baddies busy dying.  Which is good, cause the Rogue is an alt of<br />
the Druid that rounded us all up, got us to HS and picked up the<br />
Necro to summon our corpses.  Heck, we even got the Protector too,<br />
before we all went down.<br />
<br />
Even after that death (the only deaths for any of us that night) I made<br />
over 1.5 Blue in 2 hours in level 55.  Not bad at all.  And got tons<br />
of PP loot, got to blast away with Dawnfire (using my Epic on the<br />
Golems and Goos and Sperm), got tons of spells I have no use for, a<br />
Kylong War Helm, Enshrouded Veil, and ES Boots (in HS?  dunno<br />
why, on the Protector).<br />
<br />
Group consisted of:<br />
55 Cleric (Me)<br />
56 Enchanter<br />
55 (?) Warrior <br />
55 Bard<br />
60 Rogue w/Epic (like there is any other kind)<br />
58 Rogue w/Epic (I think they start with epics now)<br />
<br />
All things considered I cannot imagine a better group set-up<br />
for HS.  Damage, Damage, Damage is the key, with lots of<br />
healing ready for the mad Harm Touches.  The massive mana<br />
regain of Chanter/Bard saw me doing melee half the time.  And<br />
with Dawnfire, I probably proced for over 10K in damage. <br />
Hehe.  Love it!<br />
<br />
Love the place, love the XP, nice and quiet.  Great change of<br />
pace from spending hours on end in SG getting quest gems..<br />

<br />
Question tho: You have no evac. How were you planning to get out of there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corii Se'Lune</div><div class="date">09-04-2001, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you dungeon crawl to (I forget which wing, East maybe?) you can fight your way to the porter out in Howling Stones. Also, melees can use Thurgadin Gate potions and casters can gate. The rogues can sneak/hide and make their way to the porter out virtually undetected - occasionally a goo will see through sneak/hide, but I've run over a goo before without invis and had it not aggro on me.<br />

<br />
Waste of time..;-)<br />
<br />
Of course, the Rogue's main is a Druid, and that Rogue had<br />
a Thurg Gate potion.  He gates, gets druid, druid comes gets<br />
us.  But more to the point, you don't NEED an evac.  Since<br />
we were planning to take the she-undead out who runs<br />
the joint, it was gonna be just fine.  Dying screws things<br />
up.<br />
<br />
Is nicer to have tho..;-)<br />
<br />
It does lead to the question tho…<br />
<br />
I have NEVER ONCE built a group for any dungeon ANYWHERE<br />
thinking 'we need an evacer'.  Doesn't mean I haven't ended up<br />
with one, but I haven't been on the lookout for one.<br />

Do other people?<br />

<br />
Sounds like we should be ok. Got at least 2 full groups of 50+ members going, heavy on tanks and druids, one enchanter, and 1 other cleric beside myself.<br />
<br />
As far as evac goes, its only a consideration in raid planning for my guild when we're going into an area that we know is out of our league, such as when we had to do an emergency cr in Icewell keep and had only a few with us who were in their 40's. Otherwise, we always seem to have enough druids or wizards on to get everyone out who can't cast gate or has no potion.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the hints,<br />

<br />
HS is one of them - we don't crawl it, we pick a wing and set up shop usually. Therefore you have to get people out. Also occasionally things get messy, and you evac out, which saves a lot of CR hassles.  Another places we get an evac for is lower kobolds in velks. Can't think of any others off hand but I'm sure there are a couple.<br />
<br />
As for rogues in HS - I have a rogue also. I love my rogue. I fell in the pit over the weekend. I went &quot;Damn, I fell in the pit. Hold on&quot; and just walked around to the zone in and back into the south wing where we were. I love my rogue.</div></div><hr />

Even in west wing the vast majority of mobs HT for 600ish... if your puller only has 1500ish hp he's toast on pulls of 3... plus landing mezzes could be next to impossible for a sub 50 chanter...<br />
<br />
If you want to do HS pre-50 I' say try west wing with 2 groups...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">09-19-2001, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-50's should stick to the zone in.  Even that might be pretty scary.  There's a couple of mean skeletons that do HT.  It isn't as bad as the wings where you could potentially take 4 ht's from a pull, but still...<br />
<br />
You can pull the golems from each wing's door.  Don't forget, the East stairs are illusory, you'll fall into the basement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">09-20-2001, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 41 is probably a little low for HS, though if the group is very good, you could make some huge XP just by killing the zone mobs (not too exciting, but XP will move fast enough that you probably won't care  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ).<br />
<br />
Levels do seem to make a big difference to aggro ranges here, and given that a lot of the dungeon is twisting corridors, aggroing mobs through walls and around corners is a risk which decreases rapidly as your level goes up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xantho</div><div class="date">09-23-2001, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a single group you want a lvl 54 Enchanter minimum.  Most prefer 55+.  Same for main Tank.  on first HT break of 4 soon as i hit my tank with Celestial heal i follow it with Complete.  Have yet to lose one doing that.  further in there is a room of 5 or so that HT.  On that pull almost lost my 56 warrior and another time lost my 55 paladin.  On this pull have enchanter rune the puller.  Do NOT have monks pulling here.  They will die time and time again.  Never hunted in Drusillas area.</div></div><hr />

Also, is there any place that is a safe area near the zone in that one could set up shop in to pull just the entrance mobs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanter (me) lvl55-59<br />
Rogue lvl55-58<br />
cleric lvl54-57<br />
Tank : Pally lvl55-59 OR warrior lvl57-60<br />
Evacer/Snarer: Druid/Wizzy lvl55+<br />

Dont bother single pull Drusilla room (90% you will get all anyway) just pull all of them and memz one by one (puller, chanter and cleric need best Rune)</div></div><hr />

Yes, Juggers and Lair in Lower Seb, Royal Area in Chardok. I &quot;farmed&quot; there quit often with pickup group, Evacer is Very nessesary     http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

*edit*<br />
- PoG before River can be done with single pickup group too where you would consider an evacer<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">09-26-2001, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to Hightop:<br />
<br />
There are 2 mobs who will aggro as soon as you move from the zone-in point.  They can be any of:sepulcher skeletons, undead oblations, bile golems, bottomless feasters (have I missed any?).  In other words either live or undead.<br />
<br />
If you zone in and don't move, you shouldn't get aggroed.  But you will as soon as you move, and you will need to kill or crowd-control both mobs.  Bottomless feasters drop the candle, which is a NO RENT key to the north wing - useful if you don't have a rogue and want to move beyond the zone-in.<br />
<br />
Once they're clear, there are 2 pyre golems guarding the entrance to each wing - they're safely out of zone-in aggro range.  They can be single-pulled reliably by anyone 57+ (56+ maybe, but don't count on it).  Otherwise you'll get both on a pull.<br />
<br />
Do NOT run up the east wing stairs to pull, there's a pit trap.  If you do manage to fall into the basement below and are lucky enough to survive the fall &amp; probable harm touches, dash for the portal pad in the centre - it'll take you back to the zone-in.  Mobs in the basement will never follow you back up, there isn't a path.<br />
<br />
There is no safe spot to camp the zone mobs.  Respawn time in here is roughly 21 minutes though, so it's easy to kill the 2 zone mobs and pull golems until the 21-minute timer is about to run out, then stop &amp; wait for zone mob respawn.  Just watch the time.<br />
