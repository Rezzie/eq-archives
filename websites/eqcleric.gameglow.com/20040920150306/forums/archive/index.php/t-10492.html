<br />
MISTMOORE...i came here around 17 th to see it, promptly turned tail and ran to unrest...sepent a litttle time roaming oasis, the karanas, beholder, rathe, then went back to unrest at 20th.....after a few ( hundred ) trains in unrest, and dieing way too much, i went to mistmoore again at 20 th...in less then a week ( figure on 4-5 hours a night, monday, wednesday, friday only)  im nearing 24 th....ive died ONCE...count it ONCE, and ive only lost 3 party members, all of which were trained and ran to the zone without me......i have grouped with 5 tanks, and with 5 casters ( i do recommend a balanced group in here, just saying its possible with anything)....if you stay to corner ( not hill) and dont let naythingn run, you do great.......clear yard to zone first to make entry saf eif needed....but anywqy, just wanted to let everyone know if youre looking for a spot with great exp...( average ) loot, and bashing inkies.....mistmoore is entirely possible with good group communication and leadership..im no powergamer, but if i can do iut, any one can..<br />
<br />
stay safe and have a good tommorrow<br />

<br />
All of the complaints you hear about MM are from the higher ups that go deeper into the zone. Once you are past the graveyard it get's scary quickly. It's a great zone from 20-30.</div></div><hr />

We did really well there two nights ago. Last night we went to the corner (opposite side of the pond). I didn't think it was nearly as good. Maybe I need more time there.<br />

Well, its a great place cept for the higher lvls that pull trains of things that kill in 2-3 hits. Dark Scribe killed me in under 10 seconds flat. I went back to Unrest..only died once....damn carrion ghoul rooted me on the stairway! man was that bad.<br />
But I think I will hit 22 there tonight. I will stick around till 23-24 get new spells and back to MM. The only thing thats starting to bug is that being on a PvP server I cant go to some of the cooler places...Cazuc Thule, Sollest...all dark controlled.<br />
