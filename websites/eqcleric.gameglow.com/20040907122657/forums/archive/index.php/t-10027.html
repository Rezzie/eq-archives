<br />
I have read ad nosium the druid cleric posts and I have come to one conclusion.  Greed is destroying a fairly well designed game (considering the amont of variables in it).<br />
<br />
Clerics are not needed in a 55+ EXP group, Yup(generally), but will your night end in disaster if you have a Cleric in your group, NO.  Will you end your exp grind 1/6 of a blue exp bulb behind where you might have ended if you had some other chr, maybe.-No need to split hairs on this point btw.<br />
<br />
5 Druids are not necessary at a raid, Yup(generally), but will your raid fall in to total disarray if 5 more druids showed up, NO.  What will happen is a miniscule amount more lag, and you will have to split the loot with 5 more people.  OMG your chance at that Black Diamond just dropped from 1-25 to 1-30.<br />
<br />
If your in a guild that is not inviting any more druids, ask your self why.  If your 5 person exp group is ignoring the LFG cleric ask your self why.  If it is just greed ask your self if the opportunity to meet someone new, or make a friend, exceeds the value of plat and EXP gained. <br />
<br />
30 seconds of thought and consideration and most of these posts will go away without a single change to the game.<br />
<br />
Everquest is a journey disguised as a game.  If you choose to make it a race feel free, but you do not realy win anything at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely.  One of the things that makes me almost literally cringe is when I read posts suggesting that what people need to do is figure out what would make the group most efficient.<br />
<br />
Nope.  There is no need for maximum pixel-gaining efficiency.<br />
<br />
If I'm in a group with less than 6 people and someone asks if we need a (insert class here), my standard response is &quot;the more the merrier&quot;.  So what if we have more than one cleric?  So what if this decision forces me to do that which is unthinkable... play the game an extra few days? (if the game is that dreadful, why play at all?)</div></div><hr />

I played a shaman to 50 and realized that with three 60 shaman in the guild I wasn't needed.  I looked around and there was only one high level cleric main so I started playing my cleric more.  Ari got from 30 to 60 in the time Jen got from 50 to 52.  So now I'm 60.  When someone wants to raid, they NEED me.  When someone wants xp I'm useless.  My friends almost always invite me anyway because we are friends but I'm back to feeling not needed again.  I don't know what the solution is now.  I can solo on my shaman when I'm bored but I really don't want to.  I want to play Ariene.  I love my cleric, I want to be a cleric.  I just wish I could bring more to an xp group.<br />

Key farming, there would frequently be groups of all rangers/rogues/monks, doing all the KS ing while clerics would sit LFG for hours.<br />
This totally changed my attitude toward those people, and frankly, I am glad most of them are on break.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ancarett</div><div class="date">07-27-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every time every person comes up and asks for buffs  or heals so they can solo, stop and think about what you're doing. I remember another poster here pointed this out and I really was struck by this.<br />
<br />
Not only are they NOT soloing (with you essentially taking care of them) but you've just deprived yet another healer of a grouping/duoing opportunity. Not to mention that if you were in a group, you'd be really messing over your groupmates.<br />
<br />
That said, I still like to buff newbies, but I'm a bit more careful if I'm passing through pickup group zones to try and buff full groups or lone, forlorn LFG cleric-types.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSmiter</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ancarett, has a very good point. I had to stop and smack myself over the weekend, when I randomly stopped to cast group Heroism on a group os 12-14s hunting at the orc HW in Oasis. As I was sitting to med back up after casting Heroic Bond/Syms of Nalton/and Shield of Words on everyone in the 6 person group (including Hero on the person who disbanded to let me in for Group Hero), The group up and DISBANDED. Apparently from what I could tell from the says, the tanks decided they would be better off soloing with all their new buffs! Needless to say I felt PISSED. They would have been much better off taking on more as a group! But instead the clerics and druid got screwed and the tanks probably mooched heals off others until there buffs wore off.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I probably won't do that again for a long time, although I LOVE helping others that way. You have to be careful what you do, helping one person may royally screw over another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambul Ants</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heal please!<br />
<br />
I would but I'm medding to full to try and solo something.<br />
<br />
I just made a new hot key!<br />
<br />
Last night in seb while waiting for a group I kept 3 solo'rs killing for 30 min befor I realized what I had been doing.  Dumb Cleric, Bad Cleric.  <br />
<br />
It is a realy good point Ancarett.  <br />
<br />
If you think about it if there were vender purchased mana bandages we probably could solo.</div></div><hr />
