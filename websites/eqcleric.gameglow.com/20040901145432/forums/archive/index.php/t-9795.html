<br />
I had a most interesting conversation this morning.<br />
<br />
While camping Regis for my second bracer (last item I need for a full set), I see an OOC from another cleric asking if anyone has seen Zahal.<br />
<br />
I gave her a tell stating I hadn't seen him, and had been checking for awhile.<br />
<br />
She then asks me if I was camping for the bracer, which I respond to as &quot;Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What other quest items do you need?  I can tell you how to get any of them&quot;  She says.<br />
<br />
I respond by telling her I just need the last bracer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already have one bracer?  You should just use a RMB as your other one.  It is a better bracer&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I respond that I want a complete set, plus I want the extra AC over the extra strength.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?  Str is better than AC.  Everyone knows that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;Not everyone agrees to this&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
I respond to her comments like this:  &quot;Look, with all due respect, I'm a level 44 cleric, you are level 35.  I think I know what is best for my cleric in the style that I play him&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I've been playing since the BETA, so I know what is best for you&quot;<br />
<br />
For the record, I didn't start playing in the BETA phase, but I did start the day it was released.  Plus, this cleric isn't my only char.  Also, there are many different ways to play a cleric.<br />
<br />
Again, very nicely, I told her that I felt she was being rude in assuming she knew what was best for me.<br />
<br />
I guess my rant is this:  Offer people suggestions if they ask for them, but telling people what is best for them is often a matter of opinion.<br />

<br />
Sometimes you just find someone having a real struggle getting up there, and that's when sometimes hearing advice unasked for can give you hints... <br />
<br />
Considering you're level 44, I'd say you definitely don't have a problem  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I need to get another bracer too..</div></div><hr />

I always try to get to know senior clerics...  I've played from beta, played on Tarew Marr, and now play primarily on Quellious..  you want to know. There are Clerics that do not know as much about some things as I do, Alas I know compared to anyone with real time as a Cleric, I'm a rock in a bolder pile. =) But I do always let clerics that I meet that are level 2-20 know that I will answer any questions they have =)  Because I tend to pester other Clerics about EVERYTHING... =)<br />
<br />
Who Knows, they could have just been trying to keep a conversation alive =) I've used Stupidity to kill time before with people in zone =) Especially if they are on a camp that I am waiting for.... *Adds 8 hours to his Mitty Camp*<br />

<br />
&quot;I suggest you use ANYTHING but another quest bracer, so I can have the camp. &quot;<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have been surprised if she was after her second bracer also.  Bad advice is one of the milder subterfuges used to acquire a camp.   <br />

LOL<br />
<br />
I laughed, since they conned green and regis would probably kill them, so they tell me they have their cleric camped here...<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, I had been in there since 11:00 EST, all the way down to 3:30 EST.... Without ever seeing this person. Camo don't last THAT long..</div></div><hr />
