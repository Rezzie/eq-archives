<br />
I hear these are good for xp through 54.<br />
<br />
Good group, imho, is 35+.  I prefer tanks to be above 40.  A warrior, ranger, enchanter/bard, cleric work well.  Mix and match for last couple of spots.  I like the loot- Leo regularly clears 100 plat a night, often 200 plat.<br />
<br />
Watch out for kiters- the island is not kite friendly. Luckily, zone is usually very empty.  But you start to recognize those who think they can kite and know when they are in the zone to keep your eyes peeled.<br />
<br />
Stay on the beach near the shore to keep away from the pathing of the clops.<br />
<br />
Favorite camp spots- near the non-working druid rings (darn Verant! These should work!) or near Gornit (named HG).  Don't bind on the island.  Leo binds in east freeport- an easy boat ride in if needed.  Can gate back to bank all of that phat loot.<br />
