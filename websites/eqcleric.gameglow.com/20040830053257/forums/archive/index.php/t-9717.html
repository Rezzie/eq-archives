<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vervain</div><div class="date">11-09-1999, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so I've been in and out of the Cauldron lately, looking for Bilge, and I finally SEE him spawn.  I actually saw him fall from the sky (on the flats between the gobbo camp and Unrest, where the wandering gobbos spawn).  He's a caster, I'm told, so I stun him straight off, root, then Wrath.  Then he bursts into flames and drops.  Some L50 ranger/druid elf fellow saunters up, loots, and says &quot;Want the quest item?, 100 plat.&quot;  Now, I'm not carrying that sort of cash regularly, 'cause I'm a wimp with only an 80 base STR and loaded with my armour I'm about 3 lbs under encumbered, but I wouldn't give him the cash in any case 'cause that's just wrong, IMNSHO.  No names since he's a guilded fellow and I've already stuck my foot into it with several of the power guilds on Povar because of griping about this sort of thing, but does anyone think that this is fair or reasonable?<br />
<br />
I've now lost (counting) 5 of these sorts of spawns (Maugrim twice, Babbinsbort once, Bilge, and Cmdr Windstorm[zombie fellow with the Thex Mallet bit?]) all to people who are red to me (at 38th-39th myself).  I even lost that SG (Hatar) to some high level wood elf who claimed it was hers 'cause she had him on track before I saw him, even though he and I were engaged.  Now, he probably would have killed me, even though he was blue at the time, but I might have pulled it off.  She should at least have let me try...  <br />
<br />
Is this a high level thing, a druid/ranger thing or an elf thing?</div></div><hr />

They often play druids... or wizards.... and think that they are the most important person playing.  In reality, you are just a supporting cast member in their show.  And useful only to further their means.  Unfortunately, Verant's policy to make certain things rarer -- much like a well-known card game -- tends to inflate the perceived value of certain things to the point where people become idiots when given the chance to acquire them.  I just derive some satisfaction in knowing that a certain druid I know kill-stole some of the quest items for the caster quests, and completed one (after buying the gems) - and now has a no-drop item he can't use  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  Yes, it's a very nice item, heh... looks good in the bank I'll bet!</div></div><hr />
