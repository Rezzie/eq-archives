</FONT><HR>Hey everybody. This is my first post here, and it's on a controversial topic, so I hope it doesn't anger anyone. However, I can't help but notice that a lot of people get really upset about most of the patches Verant puts out - they also seem to get upset about class balance issues.<P>I think I have some insight into this, both as a software developer, and as a former player of this game's main competitor, Asheron's Call.<P>First of all, in terms of bad patching, EQ players have little room to complain. AC is patched monthly, generally with massive new content changes, in addition to fixes to the client, and changes to the underlying game rules. Sounds nice, but in fact, it really isn't...it's part of the reason I left the game. Software development is simply too difficult to do this so frequently, and AC is generally unplayable the day of, and a few days following, each patch. In fact, they have even had to do rollbacks of entire servers several days in length - people lost items and levels - because of bugs in patches.<P>A related issue is the length of time it seems to take Verant to fix some things. I know it's frustrating, but things that seem simple from a user perspective can be really, really tough from a developer perspective. Even simple changes in item attributes might have repercussions that we, as users, can't understand.<P>Finally, in terms of class balance, I think there is very little to complain about in EQ. In AC, we had infinite character customizability, but the result of this was not more variety in characters, it was the creation of basically three archetypes (melee, archer, mage), any of which was almost totally self-sufficient. Not fun. You could make a unique character, but you were generally weaker, and no one needed your skills. This is what makes class balance so great in EQ - no matter if one class or another is more powerful, they are all necessary. Until Verant gives another class all of our healing and resurrection abilities, clerics will be needed in every group - and in fact, you seem them in nearly every group. Class balance is quite simply fantastic in this game, because there are some things that each class can do that no other class can do.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Gandwin,<P>I've never played AC before (only willing to spend cash for one online game, not two), so I'll take on faith your comments about AC's playability and essentially three main archetype characters.<P>From a technical aspect, it sounds like EQ is far better in maintaining stability in patching.  Since massive online gaming is still a relatively new field, we maybe should expect to have tremendous hassles with the technical aspect, and count our blessings when it is fairly stable.<P>Class balance, however, is a much different issue.  In a game where there is required grouping to succeed, class differences must be spread further apart (IMO).  Having soooo many overlapping abilities and near-capabilities, waters down the balance until it becomes closer to AC's version.<P>For instance, the classic Cleric vs Druid/Shaman balance:  Clerics get an early 5 level lead into healing spells, but those are mostly wasted.  At levels 1 - 8, a warrior grouped with a druid or shaman will see very insignificant downtime than if grouped with a cleric, simply due to the fact the hit points are so few, that sitting and resting gets them back quickly anyhow.  Perhaps at level 14, there is a minor healing difference as the spread increases, but druids and shaman both by then are far more valuable because of their huge variety of spells (shield/wolf/healing/buffs) ... the balance isn't there.<P>In fact, at the first time clerics should reign supreme in healing (24th) due to acquistion of Greater Healing, Shaman get regeneration which heals ffffaaarrrr more than a GHeal does.  In fact, at 33rd, a shaman's regeneration heals essentially TWICE as many hitpoints for LESS mana than a cleric's heal does.  <P>Only at 34th do clerics break away from the pack with a superior heal than any other class.  So, before that level, I'll never believe there is class balance between clerics and druids/shaman.  <P>If Verant makes clerics more viable in the early levels, then I may change my opinion.  <P>Class balance shouldn't just be for levels 50+.  But that is all Verant is addressing when they gift all clerical powers to paladins, druids and shaman.<P><BR>Riffi Gemstone<BR>gnomish vicar<BR>Bertoxxulous server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>That's a very interesting point, how our healing abilities don't lead clerics and shamans until a very high level. However, at my pathetic level 8, I've never had trouble finding people who are happy to have me along, strictly for my healing abilities. I feel welcome in any group, so I guess I don't really mind druids and shamans being more capable. BTW, I've played both druids and shamans, and yes, they're a lot more capable! They're pretty cool classes, but having the absolute best healing, and having resurrection power, really appeals to me.<P>------------------<BR>Gandwin<BR>Halfling Cleric of Bristlebane<BR>Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Are there really self-reliant classes? From what I've seen, only the necromancer is really self-reliant, and playing alone is total drudgery. Sure, a druid can heal himself, but that mana is better spent on other things - with their fairly poor melee skill, they need to be using DD and such. Some classes are more self-reliant than others, but my impression so far has been that the group experience is far better.<P>------------------<BR>Gandwin<BR>Halfling Cleric of Bristlebane<BR>Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><B>Better a game that offers variety to all (like AC) than a game that claims to be class balanced, but is in fact only done so for a short number of levels.</B><P>Well, I think the point of the original post (or one of the points) was that "variety to all" actually leads to uniformity, because everyone gravitates toward a couple of character types.  I haven't played AC, but I've heard this observation from a lot of different people who play non-class-based games -- that the ability to "customize" your character doesn't actually lead to a huge variety of character types, as it's supposed to.  People come to perceive a certain character design as the "best" one, and everyone copies it.<P>I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but I would think it greatly lessens the social aspect of the game.  If everyone's a jack-of-all-trades, self-sufficient type, I would expect a lot less interaction.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Gandwin, wait till you get to your high teens, finding a group is nigh impossible. I have soloed almost my entire career for two reasons. 1 I can only play for so long, uaually 2 or 3 hours so when you spend an hour looking for a group it kinda cuts down on the fun. and 2nd is I have had an extremely bad run of luck when grouping. <P>Every warrior thinks he's a hero and every druid thinks he's the healer and the wizzard and the enchanter and the...... you get the idea so what ends up happening is the warrior runs into the midst of the enemy thinking he will cleave them in two by some mystic bit of luck while the druid commences nuking and healing everything in sight. The warrior by this point is almost dead and the druid is OOM. So I am left healing the warrior, then getting everything trained on me and i die, soon to be followed by everyone else in the group. Thats about when I hit the disband button, loot my body, and go soloing again to make up the lost exp.<P>but damn i love clerics!! <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Balance comes in many forms.<P>Ever notice that the more group dependant classes (warrior, cleric, enchanter) are also the more desirable in a group?<P>And group dependancy is not necessarily a bad thing. If everyone could solo, there would be alot more soloing and alot less grouping. This would be a different game and, IMO, an inferior one.<P>Besides, as a level 55 cleric with a decent reputation, all I have to do to get a group is go into a newbie zone (where it's obvious I am not hunting) and take off anon. Usually I have several invites within 10 minutes. Too bad I'd rather play my monk these days.<P>------------------<BR><B>Merpa Gigglesnort, Muerta Bella, Shakah</B><BR>Citizen of the Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I came from asheron's call also after a year of playing there and EQ is by far a superior game in all aspects! <P>hehe lets not forget LAG! <P>People you complain about lag in EQ you dont know what you are talking about! EQ doesnt lag at all compared to the rest of the MMORPG out there AC and UO  <P>hehe hows waiting 3 minutes (timed to make a single item purchase at a vendor sound!  <P>Thats lag folks!  or running for a minute and find your self totally lost in another location because you just warped due to lag!<P>So Overall EQ is the best thing out there so far! <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I agree with most everything you have said.<P>I have gotten tells from strangers throughout my time playing EQ inviting me to group. My druid friend does not suffer from this disability.  This has been uniform at all levels.  People like to group with clerics.<P>More variety would be better.  I think VI had to do something to deal with the problem of not enough clerics.  I think they did not make an intelligent choice.  But they had to do something.  I personally have always been glad that druids and shammys got Sup heal earlier.<P>I have tried playing a shaman, and quite frankly, I find it frustrating beyond belief.  They buff more then clerics and they just can't heal.  If I needed a healer I would pick a cleric over any other class.  If I needed a slower I would take a shaman.  If I needed a snarer, evaccer, healer, DSer, etc, I would take a druid.  Clerics rock pre 50.  All the classes are broken post 50.  Ask anyone who plays one....<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>With the current heal spells setup, I'm sorry to say that druids post 50 can heal just as well as a cleric (well almost as well, but you know what I mean). What makes the difference is the player behind the character. Cleric have learned (and now have to re-learn, to some extent) the art of healing by 50 levels of doing nothing else. Clerics are a dedicated healer and if you have one in your group, you can be damn sure that is what we'll do. That and a res always available insures clerics a place in high level groups. <P>Calandar Seabound<BR>Cleric of Life, 51st rank<BR>Rallos Zek<BR>Now retired</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Very good post Gandwin, and I totally agree. I played AC for 3 week and half very intensively ata time where I had been playing too much EQ and needed a break (enough to reach the low thirties with a extreme template UA, get an atlan claw, etc..). <BR> It was very entertaining for the first week and half, and then started becoming even more boring than EQ was to me at this time, so I went back to EQ. Even if Diablo 2 is just a repetitive mono-player game, it still entertained me for longer, though not as much.<BR> So far, it makes no doubt to me that the work Verant did on EQ is very impressive if you compare it to the other existing MMORPGs.By the way, I know many people in EQ that have played UO and that have tried AC, and all prefer EQ by far. In AC i was telling people i was coming from EQ as I was seeing most didn't know basic tactics like pulling to a spot, spliting and checking respawn times, etc. I realized that almost all AC players I was meeting never tried EQ, and the few that tried EQ were like me, just testing AC for a change but not involving themselves in this game.<BR> AC main problems are :<BR>- lag and LDs. EQ never lags if you compare it to AC.<BR>- economy similar to the one of diablo II. They put in item decay and spell component decay as mmoney sinks, but it doesn't work and it's boring. There are very few items that are unique (most items are random). These unique items are obtained through quests (read collecting components like in EQ, but without any 'ambiance' storyline at all). The items you need to collect for these quests have become the alternative money, making an alternative economy based on items trade. It lead to farming problems ten time worse than the ones in EQ, as any class is able to solo and farm, and there is no rules - KSing, waiting lists, etc.. are things that don't exist in AC; I should rather say that KSing if you can is the way things work (at least D2 is not a persistent world but lots of paralles servers, so you don't have farming problems).<BR>- items decay. I mentionned it above. It didn't lead to a healthy economy, especially as there have been duping bugs almost as much as in D2. And it makes the game very boring in the 20is and 30ies as you spend half of your time on buying components and recharging the mana of your items.<BR>- Three class archetypes, all of wich have much in common (they all use magic to some extent, the exact same spells..) : melee, bow-Xbow, and mage. When you create a melee, you can chose the weapon that your melee will use. Same with bow-Wbow, you can either chose bow or X-bow hehe. But it doesn't change the way they will hunt. The only difference is that for a few months, one type of weapon will be slighlty better (X-bow was better when I was playing, and for melees unarmed), then a new patch will change that (bow is better now, and i think dagger for melees..).<P> I am really sad that most of the next generation MMORPGs (DAoC, AO, SB, HZ, Dawn..) have chosen to make 'costumizable' characters. This is a big mistake in my opinion, and I think it came of all the complaining in EQ (sometimes justified but always exagerated) on the class balance<BR> issue. At least some of the coming games have chosen to mix character customization with set classes (AO does that with professions and HZ does it with races very different from each others).<P>And about the druid/shaman being preferable in groups to a cleric in the 20ies 30ies, I completely disagree. Clerics heal WAY faster than druids or shamans. Mana is not always the issue, especially as the fact of fighting yellows and reds in a very efficient group(war/rog/rog/any/clr/enc for instance) will provide much more exp than fighting blue or low blue. If you fight high con creatures, you do need a cleric. And also clerics have the best AC+HP buffs. A druid might be better than a cleric if you have some lvl 29-31 group doing Tae/tower in CT. A cleric will be much better than a druid if you do Splitpaw entrance with that same lvl group for instance (and nothing beats splitpaw exp if you have a good group that knows how to hunt ina dungeon), or even if you do FM giant fort (lots of yellows and reds at 30 if I remember well).<P>Ektarot, mage 55, Mith Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Interesting post Gandwin.<P>The only thing I question is your line "However, I can't help but<BR>                          notice that a lot of people get really upset about most of the patches Verant puts out - they also seem to get upset about class<BR>                          balance issues."<P>I think a lot of the reason people get upset with the patches that Verant puts out, is because they are nerfs of this or that of items or abilities that they CLAIM are tested quite extensively and we find out later on that they weren't tested properly.<P>How many items have they said this item is find with the effects - Donal's BP? most of the original spell list that came out with Kunark - Celestial Elixir, MOK - etc etc etc.<P>I'm sure you catch my point.  While I would tend to agree with your comments about EQ versus other games (I played UO for quite a bit before migrating to EQ) and my friend played AC for a while before coming back to EQ.  He spoke of the same things you did as to why he quit playing AC.<P>Anyway, nice post.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Excellent post. I agree for the most part with what is being said. I to was a part of the UO alpha-beta-release, and while the customizable character might seem like the best way to go, it ended up with one cookie cutter template for everyone. Once EQ was released and I tried it, I switched and have never looked back.<P>There was another discussion on one of the boards asking players, if they had the chance to design a skills/class system, what would they do. After lengthy discussion, it appeared that most liked the concept of a system based on classes, but that allowed a range of skills (possibly skills not assosciated with the base class, but if so the skill was used at a penalty). It would be interesting to see how such a system would end up being designed and how well it would work.<P>Kovina Bloodfang<BR>54 Cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005885&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005885&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
