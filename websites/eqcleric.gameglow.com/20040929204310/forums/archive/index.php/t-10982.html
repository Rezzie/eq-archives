<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where do you position him for the fight?  We tried it with him at the entrance to his lair and had the Clerics sitting right at the corner (behind where the Chetari Master sits).  Problem we had was we got a lot of OOR on people in the back (Rogues).  <br />
<br />
We got him to 50% with 18 of us, so pretty sure we'll get him regardless next time provided we keep a MT alive, but was wondering if there was a better strat than having people run out for heals (which we didn't try the first time).  When I moved Rayne in to heal he got stunned (fear) too much to be effective.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's time to get this forum back in business.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorelai</div><div class="date">08-12-2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We usually stick him right on his bind. I never had a problem with the AE/stuns/fear. Sometimes I would run right under him to heal the OOR people, usually with a group heal, unless I was in the rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brambodius</div><div class="date">08-13-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With a small team like that I can see why positioning would be important.<br />
<br />
Maybe assign a healer to watch from the back out of AE range (if possible).<br />
<br />
Other than that I think melees will just have to come to you for heals if they need it.<br />
<br />
We usually position him like you guys did but with such a small team you can expect him to gate I would expect.<br />

<br />
Some time when he's not up (should be most of the time :))<br />
<br />
go and look around and look for a nook in the back of his lair where you can hide from his AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a DAer (pal/nec/clr) to place him right on top of his pedestal and engage him there. I've never had any trouble at all with fear and AE from him, maybe you lack a bard or something? 18 is a pretty daring number to go after him with, especially if you don't have a bunch of manaburners among you. Lowest we've killed him with yet is 17 and we're pretty well geared post NToV toons. Maybe the only thing you need is a little more confidence... just march in and show him who's the boss, and AE be damned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Provided we &quot;get&quot; a next time I fully expect him to die.  We only have ~18 for most fights, but of those 18 four are 60 Rogues, 2 are 60 Monks, 2 are 60 Wizards, the only real melee we have that has totally crap damage output is my SK.  <br />
<br />
Wipeout was caused by lack of heals on MTs.  Once they went everyone else followed quickly.  Rayne and the other cleric I was running had plenty of mana when we wiped, so just trying to figure out how to refine the healing for our capabilities.  Yep, had a Bard, but MR was still too low apparently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qwenya</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We also fought him on his bind. Zland and Velk are nice training mobs to get clerics used to functioning in a ch rotation type process of some sort.  hardest thing is to not panic and to not start healing everyone except the MT when the people in your group start dying.   To alleviate this, grouping the chain together with a shaman for cure/torpor is a good move and it keeps them from having a group of people when they are in the mentality of having to heal a group.   Also makes others control their agro more because they are not with a cleric and expecting to be healed, IMO.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
I don't think we've ever used a CH rotation on Zlandi.  Our guild cut its teeth with CH rotations on the Vindicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qwenya</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, we did not either.  I was more meaning getting clerics accustomed to everyone healing the MT as opposed to healing your own group type of concept which is a precursor to set Ch rotations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apallohadas</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Klandicar is a manaburn waiting to happen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maribella</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We take our whole guild and some friends down on Zland after we wack Kland.  We just rush in and beat him up.  We don't use a CH chain on either of them.  If we get a good placement we rarely have over 1 death.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Parah</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kill him at his bind spot.  He is a trivial encounter as opposed to Klandicar's sick AE dispell/fear-stuns.  We farm him for ST keys everytime he pops with a group of anywhere from 18 to 24, and that in itself is overkill.  I'd imagine he would still be a trivial encounter with a group of 12.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crystali</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1: HarmShield a necro and move him into position, which is about a third of a foot from his bind spot, but get him to turn<br />
<br />
2: Warriors and Clerics rush in.  There's no point in NOT running right up to Zlandicar to heal since its hard to avoid his AE<br />
<br />
3: Everyone else runs in after those two classes and does their thing.</div></div><hr />
