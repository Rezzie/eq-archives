If it was a moderately safe outdoor zone, then I *could* understand why. However, I will NEVER agree with having a pally heal. I don't care what level he is or what zone the group is in, a paladin is a tank, so he should be fighting, not being a wuss and healing. (Sorry, I have a 51 pally I've played for 2 years  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif )<br />

However, this is exactly the scenario I predicted would happen with the new line of rez spells for both clerics and paladins. It may have been implemented to get the lower levels to go spelunking, but obviously VI did not consider what you describe.<br />

Granted, a Paly will do some healing. Especially with Healing Wave of Prexus and such. But, to take a Paly over a Cleric? Has never happened to me before. At lower levels, I see groups taking Druids and Shamans but never a Paly as main healer. I totally agree with Camien, a Paly should be tanking or doing melee dmg, not be the primary healer. Maybe that group couldn't find another healer, so they just took the Paly. <br />
