About Remedy<br />
Remedy is a European raiding guild, located on the Maelin Starpyre server. Our goal, as a guild, is to explore and conquer all that Everquest and its expansions have to offer, whilst having fun doing so! We aim to raid 7 days a week, with the exception of some Holidays and designated 'freedays'. We are currently looking for skilled, dedicated players who love to raid and help us achieve such success. If you're willing to work hard, have a good attitude and don't mind dieing in the name of progress then Remedy is probably the right place for you!<br />
<br />
Raiding Hours<br />
We raid during European prime time, as detailed below, however on weekends and some important events we can/may raid earlier and longer. This is usually announced in advance.<br />
<br />
3 p.m. - 1 a.m. CET (Central European Time)<br />
2 p.m. - 7 p.m. EST (Eastern Standard Time)<br />
1 p.m. - 6 p.m. CST (Central Standard Time)<br />
11 a.m. - 5 p.m. PST (Pacific Standard Time)<br />
3 a.m. - 8 a.m. TW (Taiwan Time)<br />
<br />
We don't just accept European players.  Remedy has many players from many different nationalities and countries. So long as your playing/raiding times fit our schedule.<br />
<br />
Recruitment requirements<br />
Recruitment is always open to talented and committed players who love to raid and work as a team. Raid attendance is paramount to us. You must be able to raid atleast 5 days per week.  If you cannot commit to such a schedule, then Remedy probably isn't the guild for you.<br />
<br />
You must be able to understand, and express yourself in English, as this is the main language used to communicate during raids, in guildsay and on the boards. Your account must ben enabled with GoD/PoP/LDoN expansions as a minimum.  Priests are required to have the Legacy of Ykesha expansion. You must be level 65 and have atleast your classes more important AAs. Please refer to our Alternate Advancement threads.<br />
<br />
Remedy is NOT seeking casual players. We are looking for decidated players who love their class and love to raid!<br />
<br />
Recruitment lasts from around 1 month to a maximum of 2 months. The length of your recruitment depends upon your interaction with the guild, play times, skill and how wall we feel we've gotten to know you. So grouping with Remedy members, helping out, being skilled at your class and a generally friendly person is a bonus! Other factors which may speed along your application process are flags. While being Plane of Time flagged isn't mandatory is it a definite bonus. GoD flags, however, are compulsory. All recruits are required to have or work on Kod'Taz access. (By either doing the 4 sewers and 2 mountains, or Weaponsmith and 2 Mountains.) You are not penalised for not being flagged, but do appreciate that it may take longer to get voted in if you don't gain the flags promptly, as we aren't able to see you on many raids. We do kill flag mobs (i.e Weaponsmith) but only if there is nothing of a higher priority spawned. However, we do allow other guilds to flag with us and us with them.  So the more proactive you are about getting flags the better it reflects upon you!<br />
<br />
Remedy's current raiding focus is in the Gates of Discord expansion. However, we still frequent the Plane of Time as attendance/time allows us. Being Elemental / Time geared is also a bonus, as it increases your survival rate during GoD raids, but it isn't necessary, however it is a small factor.  <br />
<br />
As a potential recruit, you must be willing and able to work on the Tipt / Vxed and 4 sewer trials in Barindu (or tagging along with another guild to get the Weaponsmith flag in Ferubi, unless we happen to do it ourselves). To gain access to Kod'Taz / Ikkinz / Uqua etc. Currently these are our main raiding / progression targets, we raid in these zones 90% of the time. We appreciate that it make take a short while to pass the trials, but showing willing and drive to complete goes a long way. Don't be scared to approach members for help, it would help them get to know you as well as you them. Good luck! :)<br />

Cross-server Transfers<br />
Cross-server transfers are always more than welcome to apply to Remedy. If you think that Remedy is jsut what you are looking for then please contact one of our officers. However it may be a little tougher to get in than someone from our native server and you may get special attention from our members as you are new to us and we haven't seen you in action before. :)<br />
<br />
Contact Information<br />
If you think Remedy is the right guild for you, then don't hesitate to contact us byt leaving a post on the message boards, or contacting Caria by PM/Email or in-game.  Don't give up if you do not recieve an immediate reply, as there is usually a great deal of spam going on during raiding hours and tells can be easily missed. Alternatively you can post an application on our general forum detailing; play times, previous raiding experience, keys, flags (GoD &amp; PoP), an up-to-date Magelo profile and why you'd like to be considered for Remedy.<br />
