<br />
Want to try something in the new lands but it all seems too hard?<br />
<br />
Want a spot that is not crowded?<br />
<br />
Well if you are in the 35 to 45 range, there’s a spot that is calling you to hunt.<br />
<br />
Trakanon’s Teeth.  This zone in Kunark is for the 35 to 45 parties but can be decent exp for a duo at 45 or solo at 50.<br />
<br />
Trakanon’s teeth has a number of “Undead Houses” in it.  Each hut contains between 4 and 6 Spectral Keepers.  These undead range between 36 and 40th level each.  Best part?  If you use a ranged weapon/spell you can pull singles EVERY time.<br />
<br />
Spectral keepers look like lizardmen but are ghostlike, floating up a few feet off the ground and semi-transparent. <br />
<br />
If you get next to the zone to Emerald Jungle, moving to the right along the wall and you will see one of these broken down buildings with Spectrals around it.<br />
<br />
Use a spell to pull it to you our your group and have a field day.<br />
<br />
A few warnings about Spectral Keepers.<br />
<br />
They are druids.  They cast a lot.  They attack primarily with Magic, Ice and Fire spells so in weaker groups, keep up RM, RC and RF.  <br />
<br />
They buff themselves up a lot so lead off with Nullify magic or MULTIPLE cancel magics.  They will have on damage shields, Skin like Diamond and possibly more.  They have been known to rebuff during a fight.<br />
<br />
BIG NEWS: The spectral keepers exhibit an hereforeto unknown behavior in Norrath.  When they get low… THEY GATE!<br />
<br />
Yes, They gate.  Back to their spawn point.  And while you rush over to get it again they will heal themselves and be healed by others.  So be careful.<br />
<br />
I suggest either A) using stuns once it is down to 25% or B) using Dismiss Undead to “pop” it when it gets low.<br />
<br />
These things hit hard with both spell and melee damage (hits in the 90s melee) so they are no easy kill.  <br />
<br />
But they are great experience for groups that are capable of killing them.  And the fact that you can pull solos is wonderful.  There is a spot between two of these houses where a group can pull from 10 spawn points with relative ease and choose the pulls when you are ready for them.<br />
<br />
Occassionally the keepers are randomly replaced by Spectral Champions.   These are monk types that are around level 40 to 43.  They hit damned fast and hard so be ready for them.  Likely they have been buffed by the druidic keepers so dispel here as well.<br />
Another “placeholder” spawn is the Spectral Commander.  Much like a Spectral Champion, it’s a non-caster but these have been level 44 and 45. I’ve pumped approximately 4,000 damage into a Commander while the party continued to melee it with 2 warriors, a bard and a paladin and it was still alive at the end and I had to DA to let them finish it off.<br />
<br />
Despite my pointing out all of the tough aspects and scary parts, it’s a GREAT spot to hunt.  No camping, no worries.  A zone nearby.  Plenty for a party or a duo to do.  Lots to pull. I highly recommend it for those who like to get away from it all and relax with a few friends in an otherwise empty zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At level 51, half of the keepers are green and not xp.  The champs are blue and decent xp.  Just use the old root and nuke method.  Keep at least 2 stuns memmed.  The commanders - don't even attempt solo.  They have way too many hp and they hit really hard.  I was tripled attacked for 119, 87 and 69.  After that round, I ran for the zone.  There are several camps (as Ofbac mentioned) throughout the whole zone.  If you zone in from swamp of no hope and follow the wall to the left, there is a ruin area with 3 or 4 there.  If you continue to follow the wall towards emerald zone, there is another ruin camp just shortly before you hit the zone area.  If you pass the zone area, you will find another ruin camp about equal distance past the zone to emerald as the one coming from the swamp zone.<br />
<br />
Also as Ofbac mentioned, when they get low, be ready to stun them, they will gate and they can cast on you from their starting point while you can't cast on them as you will be out of range.  Took me a couple mins to figure this out.<br />

Today I stuck strictly to blues and found the XP to be better and worth the effort of moving around.<br />

<br />
Tonight we'll be there with our party of 6 again (5th night running) clearing all of both houses and still waiting for more spawns and there will be these lines of clerics looking to come solo some. LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seriously doubt I'll spend any time here once I hit 52.  It's passable at 51, albeit barely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">05-01-2000, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those that don't know, from the Emerald Zone Line, there is a small house to the left that has been dubbed &quot;house one&quot; by the locals. Just beyond that is &quot;house two&quot; (yeah, I know, real original) that is twice the size.<br />
<br />
Inbetween the houses is a clean flat spot for pulling to.  If you stand on that flat space and stare out into the jungle (straight out from zone wall, and run just over that hill, bearing a little right, there is a tower with more spectrals.<br />
<br />
A group comrised of 4 from 35 to 39, a 44 and a 45, can (with excellent tactics) clear house one quickly, med for a minute, clear house two quickly, med for 2 minutes, then move and go clear the tower and then make it back to house one and med up just in time for them to start respawning. <br />
<br />
Pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />

Tried to solo one last night (from Swamp Zone)<br />

Got out of there with a bubble and a half of health left....<br />

There is the occasional &quot;uberspec&quot; that I have to zone on, but most go down pretty easy, but I have 110 self buffed magic resist, so that helps. It depends mostly on which spells they decide to cast, I'll resist force shock all day, but when they chaincast the fire DD it gets a little hairy. I keep naltron, RM, RC and RF on.<br />
