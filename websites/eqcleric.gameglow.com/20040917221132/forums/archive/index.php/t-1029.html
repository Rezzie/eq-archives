In light of the fact that there are decidedly two camps on whether to have the Quest Bracers Nodrop, I have another suggestion.  I make this suggestion in light of some other comments that I have read on this forum.  I *do* think that there are folks on this board who will get a better listen from Abashi than others do.  Many of you are over level 50 and that means to me that you are passionate dedicated people who care about what you are doing.  What I want to do is find out if there is support from experienced savvy players and I want to make a suggestion.  I am happy to start a comment thread on the gameplay board, but when I do, I want to have input from those of you who have walked down the path before me as well as from those who are getting to this point as well.<br />
<br />
When I went to get the quest legs, Maugrim was up and waiting.  She is way out on Kerra and that is part of the reason she is not camped.  Regis on the other hand is at the center of the world and basically right next to a druid ring.  Hence the ease of farming.  Druid rings to NK at the time he is supposed to spawn and wanders over to the spawn spot and has an easy camp.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the bracers nodrop, but failing that, I would like to see Regis spawn in Everfrost.  There are folks in Everfrost, it is not like kerra, but it is the kind of place you can not easily get to.  I think it would cut down on farming and only increase the travel time a bit for those that are doing the quest.  Either there or OOT, or even Kunark.  <br />
<br />
I believe I will camp Regis at 3 in the morning sometime in order to avoid most of the hassles involved in this quest, but I am curious as to your thoughts.  I have enjoyed this board immensely and thank you for your patience.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Regis will be camped no matter where he is. Maugrim is uncamped partly because she so remote but mainly because the legs are simply not worth it for the most part. If the legs had 10 wis they'd be just as camped as Regis is now.<br />
<br />
Also, most clerics go for RMBs for the +str so quest bracers become more of a nicety than anything.<br />
<br />
And No Drop won't help. JBoots are no drop and yet I'll sometimes see <br />
<br />
&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;D00d auctions 'JBoots components. 5k. will do turn-in with you'&lt;/font&gt;<br />
<br />
Already happens with the No Drop mace so it won't make a difference with bracers.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp...<br />

When I got my bracers I went to N Karana and nobody was sitting at his spawn point, I did a /shout &quot;Excuse me but is anyone seeking Zahal?&quot; and nobody replied, so I sat down and waited.  Eventually he popped, I killed him. <br />
<br />
4 hours later I came back, nobody was still there, did the same thing.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
This was on a Friday evening too, so plenty of people on.<br />

<br />
FYI: First time I had to wait about 4 hours for  Regis.  Second time he was there within an hour!!!!  There was a red wizard nearby, but he didn't respond to any tells.  I was afraid he was going to KS me, but he didn't.<br />
<br />
So far my druid has done most of my cleric's quests.  You just gotta love teleport.</div></div><hr />

My ranger got them for my cleric.  And both times I just happened to be traveling through the zone and he was up.  The first time I tried to get a bracer, I made the mistake of going after Zahal and leaving my enchanter partner at the spawn point.  A drood who had obviously timed the spawn (wasn't there before) showed up and stole the kill from her.  It doesn't seem to be the problem it once was though.<br />

What I would rather see is Gavel start refusing to give the bracers to someone who is not a Cleric.  I know that would make it more difficult for some, and I myself would not have the full set yet if this were true, but at least the spawn would be there more often.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />

<br />
Soon, the new plate armor that smiths will be able to make will have some limitations on it. Such as, only a human smith can make armor for humans... ugh.<br />
<br />
My smith is a barb shaman, I guess at least I won't have every class on my doorstep wanting twink armor  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
