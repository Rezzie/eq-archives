<br />
At level 29 Get into a LCY/CY group, you will easily be able to get 50min/1bubble there, amazingly fast decent xp until lvl 34 in there really.  If you can't get into a group in the meantime go ahead and head over to the Jail, the mobs will be sitting on the wall and can't attack(casters can nuke) and you can sit there soloing the jail and occasionally taking something from the GY...<br />
<br />
Another Good tactic, get yourself a Warrior type(monk ranger bard pally warrior sk) and head to GY and Duo the spawns there, this really helped me get out of the hell of 30.</div></div><hr />
