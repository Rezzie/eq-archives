Get a mage partner to come along, have him conjure his earth pet, preferably his L39 pet. BUFF THAT PET! Symbol, Valor and AOF.<br />
<br />
The right side is easyas it can single-pulled. DO NOT pull it between the huts, but run around them!<br />
<br />
The left requires some teamwork.<br />
Pacify one, while your mage malices the other.<br />
<br />
Pull it back towards the hill in a large arc from the houses (don't pull it between the huts, as the other side will aggro).<br />
Get the pet on the giant while you med a monitor the pets health. Malice will assure some better rooting, so it won't go after the mage while he throws 2-4 bolts of 333dam at it. The pet will do the rest  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Only use Cheals, that pet got ALOT of HP.<br />
<br />
When done, you can pull the second left spawn while the mage meds a bit.<br />
<br />
If the pacify fails, you just run away towards the zone to Swamp and the other will go after your mage.<br />
You should be able to stun-root the giant on you. If you root it far away from the camp, you should be able to go back and help your partner without having more trouble with it. It will simply forget about you if you get some distance between you.<br />
If you fail stun-root and have to zone, your mage should be able to solo the one he pulled.<br />
<br />
Your first time there, you should be able to keep the spawn at left side seperated. Later (also depending on level and skill) you should be able to get all 3. They have a repop time of 6min.<br />
<br />
The loot is nice too, some pp, forrest loop if lucky, Axes of the iron back, giant foremans tunics, weighted axes, lumberjack caps a.o. Sell all but loops to the merchants in FV.<br />
<br />
I've come to love mage pets here, they kick butt!</div></div><hr />
