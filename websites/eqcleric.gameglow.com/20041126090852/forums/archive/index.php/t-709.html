                         United Resolve in their books it should morph into Heroic Bond. United Resolve no longer exists. The unspoken<br />
                         Word finally blinds things instead of curing blindness (Hah you are my sworn enemy...here let me cure your<br />
                         blindnes!!)<br />
<br />
                         Clerics now get a NEW level 58 spell : Naltron's Mark <br />
<br />
                         Its a GROUP symbol spell thats just like Symbol of Naltron...but only costs 1 peridot. It also has a base level of<br />
                         58 so it never gets as good at 60 as Naltron does (maxing out at 446 hps) Still it should save clerics a ton of<br />
                         mana and peridots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group Naltron gives us a true choice. Group buff with a lower spell or individually Marzin everyone. I think the group Naltron will get used a LOT. I know I'd give out group Naltron as a normal buff if I had this. 11pp is so much easier to swallow than 66.<br />

**Patch Day** <br />
<br />
Greetings everyone! <br />
<br />
Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will enjoy: <br />
<br />
- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs. In addition, the range for canned emotes has been increased. -<br />
/who all &quot;guildname&quot; should now work for players who have /roleplay turned on. - Preferences for the mouselook will<br />
be saved in your options file. Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have to do it once<br />
more. - The &quot;Chat Filter&quot; tab in &quot;Options&quot; now has an option to filter messages caused by damage shields hitting others.<br />
<br />
*Fast Drop* <br />
<br />
Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground. The<br />
new client allows players to set &quot;Item Dropping&quot; preferences on the &quot;General&quot; options tab. The three options that can<br />
be set are: <br />
<br />
- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation. - CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed<br />
whenever you try to drop an item. - NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground. <br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop command. The arguments are: <br />
<br />
- ON: Same as option &quot;Fast Drop&quot; on the General Tab. - OFF: Same as option &quot;Confirm&quot; on the General Tab. -<br />
NEVER: Same as above. <br />
<br />
Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped without confirmation. Additionally, the FastDrop<br />
option only applies to items being dropped upon the ground. Handing items to NPCs will still work regardless of your<br />
FastDrop setting. <br />
<br />
It is highly recommended that you use option &quot;CONFIRM&quot;, as GMs will not reimburse any items that are accidentally<br />
dropped. <br />

Then I'd have heroic bond today if I had.  Man sometimes I'm a dork.<br />
