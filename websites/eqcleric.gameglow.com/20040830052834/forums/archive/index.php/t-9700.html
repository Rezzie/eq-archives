I've had it happen several times on creatures that were indifferent to me. I had to cast it 2 or 3 times to have it accually take effect even though it said it took effect each time. And no, it also wasn't rooted and I didn't have auto attack on.</div></div><hr />

First, this spells is powerful with a capital &quot;P&quot;. This is why you dont know that the mob is atoned. Also since the mob doesnt get chance to truely &quot;resist&quot; it doesnt cause agro. After you have rooted and atoned something, if possible strafe to the left and right while watching the monster closely. If it turns to face you then its not atoned. Often monsters will change stances when the atone take (giants for instance go from stand perfectly still (agroed) to turning head from  side to side and swinging arms.). I think Verant felt that if atone reported when the monster was effected it would be too powerful a spell, and i tend to agree. Practice rooting and atoning and pay attention to the mobs postures. Great spell. I keep memmed most of the time. Its good for dealing with unwanted greens and helping out someone being chased (if they got a lead that is)</div></div><hr />

<br />
XXXX calms down.<br />
<br />
But sometimes the creature doesn't go no-agro. This seems to happen more often in groups. I think sometimes the Atone hits about the same time as another attack and gets canceled.<br />
<br />
Atone was a serious blessing in Najena while I was camping the JBoots. I don't know what sets off that poor Wounded Halfling, but I'm glad I didn't have to kill him.</div></div><hr />
