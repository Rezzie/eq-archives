<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kestrel</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hard level limit involving players casting on NPCs has been removed. This used to be referred to in EQ folklore as the &quot;Six Level Limit&quot; (It was actually 1.25 times the caster's level, but more people likely thought about it the other way.) This means that in the vast majority of cases, there is at least a small chance that a person will be able to connect a spell with an NPC, even if they are out of that NPC's traditional level range. <br />
<br />
<br />
This makes me smirk. Who was that ridiculous PR rep before Absor? Name escapes me now - I remember him maintaining on and on that there is no hard coded limit. Oh well, seems like the game is unshackled to move in a positive direction now that certain key annoyances are out of the decision making process.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adon</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My rant is this:<br />
<br />
The hammer looks like it is all its cracked up to be.<br />
<br />
It looks like every FRIGGING FUGGIN (can we swear on this forum) cleric and his cleric dog will be wielding the summoned hammer.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, if I want to solo effectively I have to give up my hard earned primary weapon (epic/righteousness/etc) for this summoned junk that anyone with 6pp can go buy.<br />
<br />
It just TOTALLY SUCKS that they couldn't find a way to have yaulp5 make the DD proc instead of this hammer. It would be great fun to have Righteousness or Hammer of the Sun proc that 75-150 dd every 10 seconds.<br />

<br />
I think that's the point... a summoned hammer should NOT be clearly superior to an epic or other high-end weapons.</div></div><hr />

I wield what is largely regarded as one of the top if not the top cleric weapons in the game (Blackstar).  It will pain me to bag it for the hammer o' thwackin, but I will when I'm soloing or in a group where I think it's the right thing to do.  Summoned hammer is now on my &quot;loggin out&quot; spell lineup so I can make one, summon a couple stacks of food and some water and head out when I log in.<br />
