Level fast for 49 to 51 cleric? Cause the exp in DL for a 49 cleric is really bad now,<br />
and KC is too dangerous! that's why I need a<br />
good suggestion no matter is in luclin or not! soemone suggested VL to me but might be a 49 or 50 cleric too low there or hard to find a job?</div></div><hr />

Bloodgills in Lake of Ill Omen are great xp!<br />
Grab a mage and go for a swim.<br />
<br />
Mages can:<br />
1. Summon stones with EB (unless you already have an EB item).<br />
2. Summon an earth pet to keep the bugger rooted and spanking it.<br />
3. NUKE!<br />
<br />
Mages are my favourite duo partner, but you probably know that already  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
Too bad their numbers are dwindling...<br />
<br />
For cracy xp, try going to SolB with a skilled monk and smack bats and bugs. You need someone with a high damageoutput.<br />
<br />
Some of the old world zones are still great xp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rosieana</div><div class="date">01-18-2002, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went through the DL duoing with a mage.  It was really good exp for us compared to everything else that's available.  The reason why 49 sucks for exp in groups is because the puller who pulls may be a lower level and pulls light blues.  So just make sure that you have a higher level puller or you can always just partner up with somebody.  The magician's level 49 pet can rip through a lot of the mobs in that zone apart. <br />
 <br />
If I had the opportunity, I would love to level in dungeons.  But now it seems like everytime I go to a dungeon with pick up groups I don't find one or it's extremely crowded.  It's probably because now with the AA exp all the level 60s are starting to come back to dungeons that they left a long time ago.  I tried Velks it was almost impossible to find a group so me and my mage husband started duoing there but we either didn't find any mob to pull at all or get trained by some people pulling through us.  That zone was packed with people.  I also tried SolB, all the beetles, bats, and LDCs were constantly camped.<br />
<br />
Depending on how crowded places are on your server, it may be better for you to still level in the DL but just find the right people to group with.        <br />

King, Frenzy, and Lord should all be good exp until 51 or 52...as long as pulls are fairly constant.<br />
<br />
I started hunting in Velks at 49, but that was back when it was normal to see only 20 people in that zone...now it's usually 60+. :\<br />
<br />
Spectral Keepers/Champions in TT also give decent exp until 51.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thefarouk</div><div class="date">01-21-2002, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went from Lvl49 to Lvl52 soloing spectral keepers, champions and captains in trak.  Buff, med.  Cast improved invis vs. undead.  Scout the ruins and pick a fat target.  Back far enough away to not agro others (casting range is fine) and throw your DOT on them.  Follow up with roots/nukes.  Rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is where can a cleric level from 55+ now that all the dungeons are over-camped by LvL60s trying to get their special skills?  I can't find a group in Seb to save my life lately!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerycho</div><div class="date">01-22-2002, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 49 KC is not too dangerous. You can successfully do KC with a group at level 45.<br />
<br />
But, if you really don't want to do that ... <br />
<br />
SolB, LGuk, the Hole, and KK are all places you can go for great xps at 49. KK and the Hole have the best ZEM in the game, and give mad xps. SolB and LGuk are usually far better for pickup groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stern</div><div class="date">01-28-2002, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do go after spectral keepers, I cannot stress enough, buff your MR and FR , and if ya feel like it, use a symbol too..Spectral Keepers can and will nuke you into the ground if your resistances are too low.<br />
<br />
Also, expect to have some downtime medding after you kill one. At 51, I could toast one pretty good , pulling with Turning of the Unnatural, and popping them with Banish undead. But at the end of the fight, you will probably be at around 40% mana</div></div><hr />

Katta offers a quest for the EB Neck Item too.<br />

They are pretty easy at 49 for someone who would never be mistaken for being Uber (195 WIS and 808AC).<br />
<br />
The Champions are another story. I fought 3 and got totally owned once (died even thanks to stun stun stun stun stun stun stun stun). The other 2 were close but root held so I was OK.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suiren</div><div class="date">02-12-2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally liked the Hole in my high 40's, used to be very empty at the time. Now somebody let the secret out and it's as camped as OS =(<br />
<br />
KC or VL with a good group (wait, that contradicts itself I think), is good at 49 and up. You're also getting into lvl range for OS and Chardok, which are a lot of fun. SF or CS with a partner is good too, exp and spell drops. A 58 necro in my guild has taken bunches of high 40's and low 50's to fear kite the entrance of Akheva, though without him it might have been much harder, the mobs all conned at least blue to me at 51 and seeing yellows wasn't as uncommon as it is in most places. Grieg's end is also a lot of fun, but again, might be a bit over your head unless you have a few higher friends. I love the vampire fort in Tenebrous mts too, just make sure you have a tank, a chanter, a good puller, and you're willing to use peridots, the tank will need all the hp he can get with vamps proccing a 200hp dd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">02-13-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanking is about the worst thing you can do against Vamps. That's a 200 lifetap, not just a DD, and they proc it ALOT, so yer basically healing them the entire battle. If there ever was a mob made for kiting, Tene vamps are it...<br />

We just did the  entrance mobs and I managed to get 1 yellow and 1 blue in 1 1/2 hours. WOWIE! As far as I am concerned , that was great and he was getting exp too. His was goin into AA exp so he was moving about the same rate as me.<br />
<br />
We wee the only ones there and it was fairly easy.</div></div><hr />
