<br />
Just compare the breastplates<br />
<br />
Ivy Etched Tunic:  AC 19, +3 str, +3 wis, +30 hp.  Wt. 6 -- This is the Ranger one<br />
<br />
Chestplate of the Constant:  AC 18.  +8 stamina, +5 magic protection. Wt. 7.5.  -- this is the Cleric one (just in case you didn't know  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Rubicite Breastplate:  AC 19.  Weight 6.  Effect of Rubicite Aura -- The original.<br />
<br />
Now, given the option, which of the above would you rather have ? the Ranger one, which not only is the same AC AND Weight of the original, but also gives 3 strength, 3 wisdom and adds 30hp, OR, the cleric one,<br />
which is weaker AND heavier than the one it replaces, but gives you extra stamina (very handy in a class that can add 300 hitpoints and a bundle of armour class with just a couple of spells) and an amazing +5<br />
magic protection (again, very useful to a class that can boost MR by 40 with 1 spell).<br />
<br />
I mean come on, I ask you, the fact that our platemail is heavier than ranger chainmail I can live with(even though weight is a real problem with non-dwarven clerics, although by the looks of things, Verant are unaware that there are half a dozen other races<br />
that can also be clerics), but it's also WEAKER.<br />
<br />
Apparently the only things that distinguish this as being plate are the weight and the name.<br />

<br />
The extra +8 stamina we get with the breastplate will only be enough to barely cover just the +30 hp that the ranger one gets.<br />
<br />
What a crock of ****.<br />
