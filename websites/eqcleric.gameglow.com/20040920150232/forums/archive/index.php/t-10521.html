I was wondering if anyone knew a good spot for a Lvl 20 High Elf Cleric to hunt. I tried Lake of Ill Omen and it doesnt seem to be giving me good exp in groups, unless I am being PL'ed. Yet with my Wood Elf Druid I got 15 levels there in just under 3 weeks grouping with people. I just dont get it.  Any ideas???</div></div><hr />

Be prepared to play an alt for an hour or two while you wait, and once you get into the group you'll want to stick for 2-4 hours.  Often clerics get bumped up the list since the group's usually prefer a cleric as the primary healer.<br />
<br />
On a good night, you'll get 1 yellow per hour in high keep.  On a bad night, it'll take longer.<br />
<br />
The big advantage to most HK groups is that there is *usually* a master loot system in place meaning you don't have to suffer ninja looting players.<br />

It has been wonderful with my Lvl 20 dwarf cleric, Kinkek.  Try getting a group at the Skele hut or one of the forts.  Skele tower gives GREAT exp.  The skeles are still yellow at 20.  I went from 15 to 20 in three days playing about 3 hrs a day.  Well it could be because of your race or anyhting.  Are you grouping with mainly higher players than you? If so that will take a lot of exp from you.  Well I can't really help you much just try grouping with lower lvl people and try the skele hut.<br />
