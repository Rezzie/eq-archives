<br />
As the winds of chaos died, only a few remained to stand strong against the darkness. They were deemed the Knights of Nobility by Mithaniel Marr himself.<br />
<br />
Knights of Nobility seeks to shed light upon the inhabitants of Norrath and its heavens by banding together to facilitate hunting parties, protecting each other from evil forces, and sharing our wealth of knowledge with each other.<br />
<br />
If  you are seeking a guild that is more interested in adventuring and exploring than being &quot;uber&quot;, that doesn't require you to play a certain number of hours a week, likes to do a bit of roleplaying (nothing too strict), and that brings together like-minded players that enjoy all facets of the game (not just leveling), then we may be the guild for you!<br />
<br />
Check out our website (http://www.knightsofnobility.com)  and fill out our application if you like what you see!<br />
