</FONT><HR>I zoned into Sebilis, and saw 3 corpses. Looked around and I was the only cleric near the zone in. Target one, do a /who all, and see the guy is a warrior in Greater Faydark. Send a tell: "You there? you want a res?"<P>The response? "Can you ask for a 56 res for me?"<P>Oh, I'm sorry. I'm a mere 53rd level, and my res just isn't good enough? Fine. "/r Find your own 56 res, I was just trying to help."<P>Target next corpse, ressed the guy. He was in Thurgadin and was happy to get any res, even a revive.<P>Target last corpse and wow, had the SAME conversation. Told him to find his own 56 res too. He relented and said "ok, res me then". Saved him the run from Firona Vie.<P>Got a group, and about 90 minutes later, the first guy sends me a tell saying he was unable to get a port, and his time is running out and would I please res him. "/r Sorry, man. You had your chance. I am in the Crypt now, and can't get to your corpse." (A blatent lie, I was in the Iskar Jail and B1 was camped, so I could easily have gotten to him)<P>Had he not insulted me before by refuseing my res, I may have been willing to jog to the zone and res him. Would any of you done it? Or would you have done the same thing I did? Or would you just have shouted for a 56 res and left it at that?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Not 50 to 55, but I would probably do the same thing.  It was a good gesture to even get in touch with the people to offer a rez.  If they dont feel its good enough, let them find their own way or rez.  No one is required to give out rezzes, sometimes people seem to forget that.  People should just appreciate that you were willing to help.  <P>I guess personally I dont have much sympathy for others that dont feel like "so and so" rez isnt good enough.  When I was lvl 49, I was one of 2 clerics that were over 39.  When I hit 56, I was the only cleric that high.  So I was forced to take "gimp rezzes" from myself until I could do it myself.  Often in raids, even when I could give myself the lvl 56 rez, I took the lvl 49 rez from a lower level cleric.  That 3% exp loss never bothered me, I was grateful to get a rez anyway and save my time and the time of other people in the raid.  I don't believe anyone "needs 56 rez", its always nice but not a necessity.  Obviously Dikmer if they dont believe your rez is good enough, thats fine, let them find their own way.  The big thing is at least you tried to help.  Which is probably more than those same people would do if the role was reversed.<P>------------------<BR>Jhihad Daemonwrath, High Priest<BR>Xanit K'ven, Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Even if you're level 60 the difference is insignificant. I would never rez someone who had turned down a 49 rez in order to wait for the 56. That's just obnoxious and discourteous... what do they save, 15 min of xping?<P>The only people for whom it makes a difference are people who die 10x or more on a raid. With large numbers of deaths and ressurections the difference can add up. For xp groups it's simply absurd to pass up a 49 res.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Oh man, another one of my buttons (damn you have talent Dikmer =P).  Let someone make the mistake of asking my level, it's the fastest way to get ignored.<P>Since I've turned 60 I've been un-anon, but prior I was religously /role (I have that lovely button that has "/r sorry no" macro'd).  I remember once down in the shrooms a Monk drug a corpse to us and then asked if either of the two Clerics there (58 and 59 respectively) were 56+.  I immediately said it would be a cold day in hell before that person got a res.  Let them drag a Cleric down past the lower exit in Sebilis.<P>Another time someone sent me a /tell asking my level outside Karnor's.  I went ahead and finished porting out and then replied 58, sorry, should have just asked for the res.<P>People can shop for resses all they want, but I refuse to participate.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>haha reminds me of one day  I was in karnors<BR>I asked someone if they needed a ress on their corpse.  they said what lvl are you.  I replied does it matter? mind you this guy was lvl 47.   he replied yeah I really want better than 49 ress  do you have Resuscitate I laughed and said sure do and proceeded to dig through my book for the lvl 39 ress Resuscitate knowing full and well that he really wanted revivisance, but  he did ask for this one specifically. <P>proceeded to ress him then laughed at him whn he threw a fit after clicking yes cause it wasn;t the 56 ress LOL.  I said well you got the ress you asked for. <P>but yeah in general I hate when people ask what lvl you are before takeing your ress as if its that big of a differance. <P><BR>ooh and while on the ressing yourself part here I had an interesting thing happen to me tonight.  I was looting my corpse from a um well rather embarassing  experiance of getting lost and dying to a mob of greens.  and accidently looted my whole corpse after I had it dragged and  myself called to it.  realized it as I was looting the last item from my corpse (all I wanted to do was loot my ress stick then ress and loot the CoH confused me I guess I dunno) so I asked the paladin in my group  quick mem res and ress me I have the last item of my corpse on my coursor now =(.  well I guess there is a timer on looting if you don't do anything makes you stand up. and low and behold I stood up and my corpse stayed there empty so I still managed to ress it.<P>I notice though if you loot it all and click done or excape it doesn;t work that way. but its something to remember none the less.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://IFprofiles.20m.com/grimmprofile.htm" TARGET=_blank>Grimmier Divinesoul</A><BR>59th Templar of Innoruuk<BR><A HREF="http://home.rochester.rr.com/grimmier/inner/" TARGET=_blank>Inner Fire</A><BR><A HREF="http://lanys.com" TARGET=_blank>Lanys T'Vyl</A><P><A HREF="http://IFprofiles.20m.com/zhentarimprofile.htm" TARGET=_blank>Zhentarim Teken'Duis</A><BR>49th Magi <BR><A HREF="http://home.rochester.rr.com/grimmier/inner/" TARGET=_blank>Inner Fire</A><BR><A HREF="http://lanys.com" TARGET=_blank>Lanys T'Vyl</A><p>[This message has been edited by Grimmier Divinesoul (edited 04-15-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am only 47 but I must say that I have already gotten hardcore about this behaviour.  <BR>Was in DL the other day and some guys was auctioning for a res. Had been at it since I got there and was begining to get desperate. Auctioned that any XP res would do. Normally I ignore people that say things like that but I decided to give him a tell offering a res. Better than losing all your xp. BTW-I am never /role or anon so my level is easy to find out.  He responds to me "What's your level?" My responce was "Do a /who all and find another res."  Guess by taking any res he meant he was willing to stoop to taking a 49 res. So, instead his body rotted and he got nothing.  <BR>I normally do not offer to res in zones in response to auctions because I know that I will be turned down. If you ask politely, however and I am not otherwise occupied I will be more than happy to do one for you.<p>[This message has been edited by Ostrogoth Legionslayer (edited 04-16-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Karnor's has been my hangout spot for the last 3 levels. I love this zone. I love the mobs, I love the drops, I love the entire dungeon. Easy to get to and from town and just a hop, skip and a jump away from both Skyfire and a port to Sebilis. I just love it. <grin> <P>Last week I had the great opportunity to be in a couple of basement groups. With an aggressive puller and an enchanter and bard, a group could live down there for months and never come up for air. I did three blue bubs in as many hours at level 55 - no small accomplishment and a testiment to a good group.<P><fast forward to last night><P>I log in and hit Karnor's entrance. More than a dozen people at the zone, milling about. Camp check - basement is taken. I ask the basement group leader "Any room down there for a cleric?".<P>"Nah.. we have a shaman." Heh-heh. Shammies are good. Great even. But not as primary healers in the upper level zones and DEFINITELY not in the basement where the pulls are constant. Superior Healing notwithstanding, a shammie is NOT going to keep a group alive for very long. I silently shake my head and make them aware that I'll be around for a bit - "Can I get on the list then? I just logged on and would love to join you!"<P>No response. I wait a bit and repeat. Nada. Okay, no biggie - they must be in battle and he lost it in the spam. I wait a bit and swap buffs with a nearby enchanter. I see a ranger dueling a sentry and I use my Donal's arms on him repeatedly, healing him up and keeping him alive without dumping a ton of mana on him. He thanks me and gets the kill. See? I'm a nice guy. Everyone's alive and we're all happy. About three minutes pass and I resend the message to the basement guy.<P>His response - "I don't know".<P>Okay. I can deal with that. Lemme go see if I can be productive. So I run into the castle (I'm level 55 and rarely aggro the stuff in the hallways) and see if there are any undead blues I can solo. Dang. Nothing. I check the zone - 48 peeps there. Holy Population Explosion, Batman! No wonder there aren't things to hunt. I find a few people huddled in the closet and offer to group Hero them as I see that their cleric is level 48. They are very happy with the results and I leave them to their fun. I go back to the zone and sit and med a bit. <P>Then I spot possibly one of the BIGGEST trains I've ever seen in this place. At least 8 skeletons, a half a dozen mutts and a Hand come POURING over the bridge and towards the zone. Within 2 seconds they are on top of me, smacking me like a spoiled child. They were so thick and concentrated that I couldn't see through them. No train warning, no shout. Just tons of bad guys. Zoiks. This can't be good...<P>I quickly check around me for any enchanters who can AE mezz the bunch. None. Time to get out of Dodge. I zone out with about 200 hit points left. I started with 2410.<P>Now, I'm on a 56k dialup, so my zoning isn't the fastest. As a matter of fact, I've seen abusively fat people squeeze into Lamborghinis MUCH faster than *I* can zone. I get to the other side and get TRAMPLED by requests for rezzes inside Karnors. Purple text flows up my screen. I'm the only un-anon cleric in the zone. (Shocker!) I respond to a few of the folks I know and tell them I'll help them as soon as the zone clears. They are pissed about the nasty train but seem relieved that I can help them. A few others get the afk message "I'm getting pummelled with requests for rezzes. I don't have a rez stick - please check for other clerics near you to help as I don't have THAT much mana."<P>I zone in to rez my buddies and whose corpse do I see at the zone? - the basement group leader. He was unlucky. I get a tell from him. "Can you rez me?"<P>He gets my /afk message and repeats himself once. I fix up the folks who got caught in that @#%$-storm train and med up more, getting a cool breeze from a nice enchanter who saw me helping others. ("Thanks, Mmog!") Then I get another tell from the basement leader.<P>"Can you rez three of us?"<P>Never a "please". Normally, if I have the time and mana, I'll rez someone. I like helping. But this guy was somehow rubbing me the wrong way. I'm not sure why, but he was. So I ignore his request and continue helping the folks who got railroaded. (Mental footnote to folks asking for someone to dump 700 mana on you - try "please" and "thank you". All I've *ever* asked from other folks is a little bit of courtesy for your fellow man/woman/ogre. <grin>)<P>Theeeeeen... the full story comes out from the basement group leader. That train was theirs - the shaman got aggroed from debuffing and then healing and went down fast. The shaman helped the puller live, but not before the heal aggro pulled about six mobs into the basement. Their enchanter mezzed a bunch before he ate it and the remaining four bolted, bringing all of them and their wide aggro range headlong into the only exit. The puller (the group leader) got caught and went down 40 feet from the zone. End of the sad story.<P>After going OOM twice while doing rezzes at the zone (there were NINE innocents at the zone who went down) I give the leader a tell.<P>"Got room for a cleric yet? <wink>" Now, mind you.. I don't want to join a group that pulls THAT kind of a train to the zone without so much as a warning. I was just curious if he was going to invite me or not.<P>"No, can you rez my group?"<P>"I guess that shaman can't help you much? <wink>" I let him chew on that for a moment, just to see if he's gonna go WFW on my sarcastic ass. Then I follow up his request.<P>"Sure.. I'll rez you. I see your body here. Give me a few moments to med."<P>I go to cast rez on him and he says "Wait. Don't rez me yet. I'm looking for a 56 rez." <P>What a little turd!! Okay.. let's see how long he's going to wait for a 6 percent increase in gained XPs. Experience which, if you are in the KC basement, can be regained in about 10 min. His dead shaman is bound at entrance to Sebilis. And the group leader is bound in Thurgadin. Ouchies.<P>I sit around medding for a bit.. and get invited to a group with some friends who just logged on. We take the left courtyard with a full and balanced group. We start pulling and the fights are short but fun. Constant killing and LOTS of bone chips. Sweet!! /random 100 <Grin><P>I get a tell from that basement group leader more than 30 minutes later. "Hey can you rez me?"<P>Holy shiite. These brain-locked experience hounds have been mulling about for about forty-five minutes looking for a TINY increase in regained experience when they COULD have already been rezzed and hunting! I cannot believe the short-sightedness of these people!! I give him my standard reply hotkey "/R I'm sorry friend, I'm in a group now and cannot help you."<P>He pleaded and begged for about 10 min, and even had someone drag his corpse to the back courtyard and deposit it at my feet - which, by the way, is a bit uncool if you've already been declined a rez. The dragger then emoted "/points to corpse" and other niceties to grab my attention while I'm in battle and LOM. I don't have a chanter nearby and there are no bard tunes are available to help with downtime. I tell him "Drag to the zone and I'll rez you when I'm done here". He goes off in a huff and I never hear from them again.<P><BR>Moral to the story, Folks?

</FONT><HR>Omg, great story. Turning down a 49 rez for a 56 one was one of the biggest annoyances I had. I was in sol-b camping efreeti with a monk and warrior friend of mine, was the only cleric in the zone, and was 55 at the time, and I kept noticing all these shouts for rezzes. (Usually they shout they need rezzes before they start shooting tells to me) And this one guy was shouting "Really need a 56 rez but I will settle for a 49 one if I have to" (obviously the 49 rez being me) and that just pissed me off. I did a /w on him and he was 47.. 47!! What the hell does he NEED a 56 rez for? Needless to say, he didn't get the 56 OR the 49 rez he was looking for.<P>The only other thing that annoys me is group rezzes, which I wouldn't mind doing if I had an epic.<P>Avenea 56 cleric CT</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

You asked if he was 49+, not 56+.<P>The difference between 39 and 49 is substantial and in the post 50 world can mean the difference between hours lost or minutes lost (exp is really nothing more than time invested). The difference between 49 and 56 is insignificant really. 6% is maybe a blue sliver and the time it take to regain that lost 6% of your lost exp (typical post 50 loss is half a bubble or 10% so 6% of that is 0.6% of your total exp bar) is maybe 5 mins or so.<P>What is so frustrating is that people seem to care SO much about that 0.6% that they will be rude or inconsiderate. I went through tons of it in my 39-48 days where people would send me tells, and either A) make me wait for a 49 and then "settle" for my 39 res (they'd never get a res if they did that) or B) ask for a res and then get a 49 and not tell me ("oops, sorry you were saving mana to res me when I already got one"). Yet it makes no difference to many. Won't res me? I'll go somewhere else. I've even had group members who will /shout for a 56 res before they would ask for a 49.<P>To put it bluntly, it shouldn't matter if it's 49 or 56. If you want to make a big deal about that 0.6% loss you may have to settle for 100% loss.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I tend to agree with the general consensus and I've been in the same situation - been offered a res, and I've asked ifs its a 49+ because I could indeed do it myself.  Definately not rude to ask in that situation.<P>I do however, disagree with the 90% and 96% res difference.  For a single resurrection yeah its silly for people to waste their time trying to get a 56 res when a 49 res will do just fine.  I do feel though that a monk pulling in hate/fear or the like and takes 20 deaths in one night, 0.6 percent times 20 is 12 percent.  THATS signifigant, and thats where the 56 res plays more as a raiding res, rather than a standard "wtb xp res" kinda thing.<P>Aladain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Just an added note.  I was in OS the other day and got into a "discussion" about 49 rezzes.  I was told in /ooc that my rez does not give back a fixed amount.  It can vary betwee 75 and 90%.  I countered that with "really?  I've never given less than 90%".  To which the conversation ended with no more rebutals.<P>I can see where multiple deaths are concerned you'd want a 56+ rez but MOST of these examples are people that have only died once.  That staggering 6% they gain by finding the 56 rez will definately save them oh about 45 minutes of work post 50.  <P>It boggles my mind how clueless some people can be about clerics.  Not flaming them, just expressing my exasperation.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>OBTW, at level 52 I died twice last nite and had to settle for a 49th level rez.

</FONT><HR>It's truly amazing that some people won't accept a 49 res when 56th is not available. <P>Here's what happened to me the other day in POG.<P>We had 4 groups in POG when the puller brought back 7 mobs. Needless to say he was supposed to kite the mobs by us (at safe distance) and have someone tag one. <P>Well, Murphy was active that day and we got all 7 mobs.<P>Needless to say it was a complete wipe out. Out of the 3 clerics there I was the only one who didn't get a chance to camp (mob aggro). The other 2 clerics had both camped and not yelled CAMP or anything.<P>So, after I get my 49 res (I was the only 56+ cleric there) I loot up and start to med.<P>I immediatly res the dead enchanter (gotta have my C2) and ask the other clerics how ressing is going when I got this reply:<P>"You need to res everyone."<P>/r Ok, start ressing and I'll res the puller, anyone who lost their level, and anyone who the other clerics don't get.<P>"No, you need to res everyone they won't take 49 res's"<P>/r I hope your kidding. Anyway I don't have enough mana to res 20 people.<P>"Dude it's not really open for discussion".<P>Now this last line really floored me. What's worse is that this came from a level 55 cleric.<P>Here was my reply:<P>/r Well, tell the people that they eithor take a 49 res or walk. I just took a 49 res and if it's good enough for me it's good enough for them.<P>"Umm you need to talk to the raid leader"<P>/tell Raidleader_01 Please tell people to take whatever res their offered. The only exception to this is the puller (who dies alot) and anyone who lost their level.<P>"No, give everyone a 56 res"<P>/r I don't have the mana to do this. Take the res your offered or walk.<P>Needless to say at this point they took what they could get. I res'd every person I could and used ALL of my mana doing this.<P>After the ressing was done I had 1 person out of that entire raid even say thank you. I even had one person who was level 46 tell me they "had" to have a level 56 res.<P>These people just cracked me up. After all the ressing was done I told the raid leader to get a replacement for me. After the replacement showed up I gated.<P>I now flat out refuse to res ANYONE who turns down a 49 res unless it's due to level loss , their the puller, or their level 59 (which is HELL).<P>What ever happened to people being happy just getting a res?    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P><BR>Resurrector<BR>Cleric of the 58th (Veeshan)<P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Resurrector (edited 04-16-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The difference between 90% and 96% is fairly signifigant, especially at 55+. I'd hold out for the 96% if I could (and I frequently skip rezzing myself in favour of waiting for a 56 rez), I can't really blame anyone else for doing the same.<P>I can see how you could find it insulting if someone was rude or cruel about not wanting a 49 rez, but I don't see how you can fault someone for politely informing you they'd rather wait than get a rez from you. <P>As for being insulted when they ask your level when you offer a rez, isn't it entirely possible they have a 56 rez en route? Wouldn't you also wait in that circumstance?<P>I get annoyed when people ask my level since I'm never, ever /anon or /role, but I generally just reply with '/w aiien all' and wait for them to figure it out themselves. <P>I have a hard time understanding the attitude displayed here, you refuse to help people because they look for better than what you can offer? When you get right down to it, rez is a commodity.<P>Do you always sell for the first offer you get? Do you always join the first group you're invited to? Do you always take the first person to shout LFG when you have a spot to fill? Those are all commodities too, why are you any different?<P>Aiien.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

I play EQ to play, and to save on downtime, sometimes I don't res myself, just get right back to it.  If I am doing my good deeds for the week and clicking on corpses, I don't mind if they say no.  No skin off my nose, as it doesn't interfere with my game time.  Just don't ask me later when you can't find one.<P>Two stories...<P>I joined up with a four-already-dead crypt group.  We do CR which took over an hour due to LD'ing and people killing with fine steel blunts with no blunt skill, and some guy wants a 56 res.  With me not being that high yet, he asks the rogue to drag him to the 56+ in the guardian.  Rogue says no way, take hers or drag it yourself.  Well, he dragged it himself.  What do you think happened?  Yup, he died on the way up.  But he did get his 56 res, two of them in fact    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Fear raid wipeout.  A couple in fact.  One 56+ cleric.  Was told she was going to do them all (35+ people).  Frustrated, I start /who'ing and asking "49 or 56".  Got about 1 ok and 5 rejections before I gave up.  So instead I sat there with full mana for well over an hour while bodies where dragged and ressed, then recovery and re-set up.  Well I did heal the incoming.  IMHO that time spent with one cleric ressing could have been used in EXP groups after we left Fear to make it up.  Instead it just became a very long Fear trip   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P><p>[This message has been edited by Morgan (edited 04-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The difference between a 49 & 56 res is NOT that significant, unless you're a raid puller who expects to die a lot.  I dug up some figures from ShowEQ (no I don't use it, but the XP tables are really useful)...<P>It takes 47695605 XP to get me, a halfling cleric, through level 55.  If I die, I lose about 2.5 blue bubbles, or 10% of the level.  That's 4769540 XP lost.<P>Now: with a level 49 res, I regain 90% of that loss, so I end up actually losing 476954 XP.  With a level 56 res, I regain 96% of that, so I would lose 190782 XP.<P>So: that's a difference of 286174 XP between the resurrection and reviviscence.  How much is 286174 XP?  Any guesses?<P>It's about 4 yellow bubbles at level 11.  How long does that take to regain when you're killing level 50+ mobs?  A few minutes.<P>Let's recap.  A death at level 55 means:<P>No res: 4769540	lost (~equivalent to level 38)<BR>Resuscitation: 2384770 lost (~equivalent to level 29)<BR>Resurrection: 476954 lost (~equivalent to level 13)<BR>Reviviscence: 190782 lost (~equivalent to level 9)<P>In other words, the correct response to "what level?" is "get lost".<BR><P>------------------<BR>Morrun Catspaw<BR>55th level Templar of Bristlebane<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I really don't take offense to getting turned down.  What I can't stand is the same person that turned you down *whines* back at you a few minutes later saying "I'll settle for a 49 rez".<P>Well BITE ME!  You didn't want it when it was offered, you are not getting it now.  <P>If they want to wait for a better rez, more power to them.  BUT DO NOT come calling back to me because you wanted to save that precious 6% and your 56 cleric decided to log or got killed.  Boohoo hate to be you.<P>A lot of clerics find this topic *very* touchy (me included).  I hate being thought of as inferior or lacking in skill.  I've leveled my cleric up as my main and have been playing for a year now; so I think I have an idea as to what I'm doing.

</FONT><HR>This just strikes me as so horribly ridiculous.  I understand people turning down resus in order to try to get a 49+, cause 50% is a big difference.  Most people I ask if they want my 39th lvl res are happy to take it.. and my groupmates often will to if no one else in the zone will res them right away.  I always just res myself unless there is a 49+ cleric in my group or /oocing "ressing at zone" <BR>The enchanter in my group the other day was bugging us to get him a 56th lvl res though, he "really needed one"  he "lost four whole blues"  I felt like saying, "that is nice, I lost 6" but when it became apparent we weren't going to hunt anymore until he got his res I just logged.<P>Unless my guild breaks up and I join a much larger I will probably never have my epic.  Just not enough friends and guildmates to do all the raids.  I could probably pull a few favors and badger people and get it, but then I just have to get more crap from people.  Don't get me wrong.. I would love to have my epic, but crap like this makes it so much easier to bear the fact that I probably won't have it for a very very long time to come.  And the way I lvl, I know I won't have 56th for a long time  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>46th lvl cleric of Brell<BR>Flames of Faradhim<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006017&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006017&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
