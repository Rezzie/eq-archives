<br />
From now on, I'm going all +STA +HP. <br />
<br />
Since I'm using group heals mostly, I'm always in range of my own heal.<br />
<br />
Your mileage may vary.<br />

At level 59 with resists over 200 it doesn't really seem to resist many of the AOEs. Seems like most of the uber Velious (and updated gods) now hit you with spells no matter what your resists.<br />
<br />
Anyone found this to be true as well?<br />

They hit me full almost all the time with about 100 resist at Lv60. At 130 to 150s resist, the weak AE always can't hit full, but the strong one still hit full most of time. At 200 or so resist, all of their AE almost never hit me full.<br />
Seems resistant is kinda useless for Lv60 or so mobs AEs if you are lower than Lv58. I noticed a big different on trakanon's AE at between Lv57 and Lv58.<br />
<br />
BTW, Alliliel, saw your equipment check post. You should attempt to get a weight of the gods from sky. I got mine couple days ago while leading a group of newbies to clear 1st island for fun, hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my 59 SK I resist the Molten Lava more than half the time with 208 fire.  The other AE that procs I never fully resist, but frequently resist partially.  I don't do as well on the cold based dragons, but cold is only 180 on the SK.<br />
<br />
Rayne has 150 Fire/159 Cold and resists almost everything.  That's because he referred to this nifty chart:<br />

(Its the same negative to resistance that the lv 44 Wizard spell Enticement of Flame gives in fact).<br />
<br />
DragonRoar and other Dragon AE spells inherently lower our resists similar to the Wizard's Lure line of spells.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">05-31-2001, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple things:<br />
<br />
Hall of testing AE's like &quot;Rain of Molten Lava&quot; is a Cold Check in the spdat.  <br />
<br />
300+ resistances only seam to improve resist rates versus lure spells.  200 MR and I resist 95% of old style dragon fears.  200 MR and I resist 40% of new style dragon fears.  The difference is lure.  My theory is Lure just treats your resist as if it where lower, and removes the level check.  There are different levels of lure, shown in the spdat by the -cha line.   A -5 cha is a medium lure, some get as high as -9 cha.   A -5 cha is would treat 200 MR as if it where 100 from my estimates.   So I would recomend about 300 resistance vs any lure spell.  <br />
<br />
In VP 200 MR is very important against mobs like Druusk and Phara Dar.  Druusk's AE will eat you alive if your not careful and have low resist.  Phara Dar will stop you from casting at all if you have too low of MR.<br />
<br />
But as a general rule I shoot for 200 of the given resist in VP, and its kept me alive quite well.<br />
