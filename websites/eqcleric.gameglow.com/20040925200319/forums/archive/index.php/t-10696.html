<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My group consists of a 40 Wood Elf warrior, Enchanter, Cleric, Wizard and SK, and occassionally a 43ish Rogue.  We're currently hunting wasps in Burning Woods, but I'm guessing we'll want to move on in a couple of levels.  At what point could we give City of Mist or the Hole a go, or can anyone suggest someplace else?  The SK is the main tank, and since we have an enchanter we tend to prefer the challenge (and relative quiet) of dungeons.<br />
<br />
We've already spent several weeks in Mistmoore and Kaesora, so we'ld like something new.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZirakZ</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">City of Mist would be a great spot for this group, melees can bind there, exp is good, and its rarely camped except for the Reavers in the castle.  <br />
<br />
Other good dungeons for this group would be Droga, which would provide a real challenge for your enchanter, and the old standbys of Lower Guk and Solusek B.</div></div><hr />

Those are the places I've grouped in the last week and have had lot's of fun in all of them.<br />

Three camps near the zone (stables, bridge, temple) and the goos further in once you have outgrown those. Melee-bindable AND a dungeon xp bonus!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the responses!  I'll probably push for CoM next since we're already in Kunark.  Another member of the group is thinking the Hole sounds good though, so we might had there.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  We did the first 4 levels of ToFS, and I wouldn't mind going back to finish it off at some point too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vandh</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having a problem finding players WILLING to go to solb and lguk. They used to be camped to the point that you could almost walk around safely. Lguk usually has a couple necros, a group of farmers 55+, and maybe 1 legit group there for exp. When I ask my friends to go they get all evasive and say they are going to DL. DL exp BLOWS, plus the loot will not allow you to upgrade your equipment well enough to meet the curve when you hit 51. <br />
<br />
/sigh kids these days just won't go that extra mile...<br />
<br />
I get bored of soloing my main and want some old fashioned dungeon time with the 40 cleric, the kind with some heavy pucker factor on it.. just can't find it anymore!</div></div><hr />

I'll group up with ya if your on Bertoxxulous.  By the way, I just went into Unreast for a guildmate and it was kinda fun going downstairs with only 3 people...much easier than I remember 30 or so levels ago!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clarea</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you have a set group, places like the City of Mist, the Hole, and Sol B are great for experience. They are generally underpopulated, give exp bonuses, and never run out of mobs. The downside is that once someone has to leave, the group usually breaks up due to a lack of a replacement.<br />
<br />
For me, I generally look for pick-up groups. This means I am usually situated in Dreadlands. After I hit 46, I will try to find experience in Karnor's Castle. It has not been hard for me to find groups in DL due to the constant need for healers. If people leave, there are usually many ready to take their place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bizzle bazzle</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup. same reason i pull my butt over to DL. i dont have a nice set up group like that to take to some xp bonused zone. plus the lack of replacements for someone who leaves. i find that DL xp is great for 38-45. once i hit 45 though i'm out of there though... KC is train hell, killed my bard 3-4 times lastnight over trains =\. SOLB on tholuxe paells is filled with people all day long. crystal caverns is EASY to pull a group together from the guild or find one that will share a camp. i don't really worry about cash, my b/f lets me log on his char to farm up cash sometimes... would like to find a nice solo/groupage spot on luclin though.<br />
