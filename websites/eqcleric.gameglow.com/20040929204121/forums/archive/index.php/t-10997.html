<br />
/RANT on<br />
Lately I've been approached by quite alot (more than the rez-requests I get) who asked for Aego.<br />
<br />
Pardon me, but if I'm in a zone like Charok or Velks and prepping at zonein, WHY do some lousy monkey twink think they should pester me with &quot;aego plz&quot; requests??<br />
<br />
No offense, I know alot of great monks, but it seems like they are the worst aego-beggars.<br />
<br />
And some even think 1 peri is enough - grrrrr - 750 mana is quite a chunk of my manapool and if they think I will throw it at them so they can solo they are making a big mistake.<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started with the L40's who think 1 peri is enough for buffing them. Some don't even get it when I explain I have to use my group aego (and 2k mana!!!) to buff them.<br />
Why do they think I spend 25k pp on a spell? To buff their newbie butt? Heck no! Go group with a cleric!<br />
<br />
ARGH!!!!<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Ahh, I feel much better now :)<br />
<br />
I think I will start charging 5 peris (and NO plat, just peris) for each aego outside group - what do you do with aego requests?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want aego? Sure, 100pp.<br />
<br />
Mostly after that the discussion is over :)<br />
<br />
I am not everybodies buffer, if they ask for HB or Resolution, just fine, but Aego is another matter due to mana and peridot costs.<br />

I have even gotten tells from people several zones away asking me to wait.<br />
but i dont.<br />
<br />

well i only do this when im logging off for the night, but most of the time i get buffs, peris and PP for doing htis :)</div></div><hr />

What gets me most is he just ASSUMED I had the spell.  Not every cleric does.<br />
<br />
Also, after scolding him for several mins, he finally offered me 50pp.  grrrrrrr.....I can't type anymore about this, its just bringing up more anger in me...</div></div><hr />

When I didn't respond he started offering more and more pp.<br />
<br />
Was tempted to ask for the pp first but finally setteled for telling the guy off for the fact that I'm only 57 and hes asking for a lvl 60 spell and just because he offers more and more pp doesn't make me more likly to do it.<br />
<br />
He said &quot;You're loss&quot; and walked off........</div></div><hr />

And the ones who pop a dot or plat into a trade window can make it even worse when I am the only boxed cleric in a ticklish area in VT waiting on the monks to tell me the mobs have reset so I can accept the rez and save the raid a &quot;walk of shame&quot; back for corpse summoning.  I now have a hotkey that says &quot;No i am sorry I cannot buff you as I have no dots but I do have a rez window I cannot afford to lose so please do not try to give me dots or plat to buff you.

 Still trying to figure that one out :rolleyes: Must say, I'm glad that I'm low enough level I miss out on the really annoying requests (except all the rez demands when I'm hunting down in Lower Guk -- especially the guy who wanted me to come rez him in Dawnshroud).</div></div><hr />

I always turn trades OFF when raiding - well, actually, I only turn trades on for a rare moment when I do need to trade.<br />

Nothing worse than being traded with - be it when naked and waiting for a rez - or mid fight when using rods.</div></div><hr />

If I don't know the person or I'm not grouped, I probably won't do it. People pay 50p for kei, 50p for ports, *sometimes* pay for rez, but they think they can get aego for just a dot.<br />
<br />
One time I was waiting for a port when some level 37 paladin comes up to me, says &quot;boa plz&quot; and puts 40p in the window. I tell him I don't want to use the mana and the 40p barely covers the cost for the dots. Then he gets all mad and starts flaming me... was pretty funny :p</div></div><hr />

Only thing I can suggest is to let them know what it really does cost to cast and whether or not they are willing to reimburse you fairly in some way. I am reading eveyone elses input and at least I will have a good idea what to do when I get there.<br />

I had this happen to me for the first time the other day in Velketors while I was soloing some spiders.  First he called me weird because I was meleeing.  Then he asked for aego while I was sitting chatting with friends.  I told him it costs me 11pp.  Long Pause.....he says &quot;is that a no?&quot;  I said, &quot;I'll do it for 11pp, that's what a peridot costs.&quot;  He just says &quot;Oh&quot; and takes off.<br />

If random monk was a friend, sure, guildie, sure.  Random soloing newb that I've never seen before...pay me please---AND ask nicely.<br />

A more successful monk a few weeks ago /tells me will you Aego me please?  I have several gems I can offer....so I got 2 CFE's for it :)  Now that's more like it.</div></div><hr />

They tend to understand right off though that Ican't at the moment.  But now, I got a hotkey made for when I'm in the bazaar basically stating that I will Aego if someone brings me a dot.  If they're too low level, they'll have to put up with a HB and symbol or bring 4 dots for group Aego.  Sometimes I get cash (which isn't too abd since I'm in the bazaar) but it's usually more than I need, say like 50pp for a single Aego.  Usually get multiple dots for it though, have had up to 6 for single Aego PLUS the fact my RMB went off and I saved the gem.  6 dots for one Aego w/o having to use one counts me lucky.  How I stayed supplied with dots. ;)</div></div><hr />

People are arrogant, but they are funny (unlike me sometimes, which is rare). Use the macros and emotes in a fun way. Maybe they are having a bad day and have been asking for a while for Ageo.<br />

When I roleplay with someone like this, I often get alot of fun out of it and maybe I'll find a friend.<br />

I credit Trish, on Quellious (NF) for turning my EQ negativity around to positiveness when she showed me how to use macros. What fun I had. Although, if memory serves, I got bonked on the head alot that day....<br />

<br />
Had a 36 ranger literally BEG me for aego last week.<br />
I refused him when he didn't want to provide ANY peris at all.<br />
<br />
I was in a pretty good mood after a great night of guildfun so I threw Reso at him. I don't know why but that made him start using foul language and getting all upset about getting an &quot;inferior&quot; buff.<br />
THAT got me rather annoyed so I invited him into group and promptly annulled him.<br />
If he wasn't upset by then, he became so when he found out I had stripped him of C3 as well.<br />
<br />
Guess that's one n00b having to find a group to share the xp's with and getting &quot;inferior&quot; buffs from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crystilla</div><div class="date">09-24-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, same story here (although I've never annulled anyone - never knew you could hehe).<br />
<br />
Was in Nexus last night and had a lvl 14 ask me for Aego.  He was roleplay, and I asked for his level.  He replied &quot;14.&quot;  <br />
<br />
I told him, if he wants aego he will need to supply 5 peridots for me.  He said he didn't know why, so I went through the whole thing (I gotta hotkey that statement I use it so often) of how if you are under level xx single target doesn't work ... blah blah.<br />
<br />
I said either hand me 5 dots or 50 plat, and I'll be happy to cast it.  Otherwise, I'll offer you HB, Jasper Symbol and Shield of Words for free.  He jumped at that chance.<br />
<br />
I keep 2 stacks of jaspers around specifically for these incidents.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSmiter</div><div class="date">10-01-2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue really is that clerics are way too nice. <br />
<br />
Druids are not known in general for their generousity, although many ARE very generous. The opposite is true for clerics. <br />
<br />
I've had people ask me for a rez, then when I get there give me less plat for my rez, then I had to pay a druid to get there.<br />
<br />
I see enchanters getting 100PP + for KEI, I don't get 100pp for rez or Aego. rez saves how much lost time and exp? Aego adds how many extra HPs to you? I've Rezzed enchaters who then cast KEI on me and then act like they did ME a favor! Now I'm not being picky here. Just pointing out some things I find odd. I never have an issue buffing or rezzing anyone. But I do find it a pain when I try so hard to help people out and then get abused up the butt by druids and enchaters who have collectively decided to take advantage of the financial opportunities they have.<br />

At the very least I think all classes should provide free services to all clerics. We do it often enough for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I'm in full SkyShrine and have my Epic and many people seem to have the weird mathematics of <br />
<br />
Full SkyShrine Armor + Epic = Level 60<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I got my Epic at 54 and full SkyShrine at 56. Usually I tell them I am 57 so cannot cast it yet (often I ask them to PL me :p). But yesterday was the crown. Out of the blue, I get this:<br />
<br />
Druid_51 tells you, &quot;AeGo&quot;<br />
You tell Druid_51, &quot;??&quot;<br />
/who Druid_51<br />
[51 Dr00d] Someone (Wood Elf) ZONE: Bazaar<br />
/who me<br />
[57 Templar] Kaysha (Human) [Glade Knights] ZONE: Bazaar<br />
Druid_51 tells you, &quot;AeGo&quot;<br />
Druid_51 tells you, &quot;May i buy&quot;<br />
<br />
I politely corrected him and criticised his manner of speaking to me (or anyone, for that matter - all other Aego beggars at least had the decency to just start off with a hello or a hi or something). He never replied to it.<br />
<br />
I wasn't /anon - actually I hardly ever go /anon or /role - so people can see my level clearly. It annoys me that people don't even bother to check my level when they ask this. Also, in the case of the dr00d who told (by lack of question mark, his tells weren't a question) me for aego, two more things annoyed me. One being the fact that he uses &quot;i&quot; when referring to himself instead of &quot;I&quot;, this annoys me to no end; the other being that he didn't conclude his apparent question with a question mark (and thank god he didn't bother to type &quot;plz&quot; which would have annoyed me even more - if you bother to type that thought, write it as &quot;please&quot;, thank you).<br />
<br />
Three more levels before the vultures see I'm at valid aego level ...</div></div><hr />

My guild had just finished with the triplets in Ntov and I was so tired i couldn't keep my eyes open so I didn't even wait for a trans out.  I gated out to my bindpoint in WW in front of ToV and was almost ready to camp when I get a tell. <br />
<br />
AegoBeggar01: &quot;Friend... Are you busy?&quot;<br />
Alihra: &quot;Um yes, I am about to log, I'm very tired.&quot;<br />
AegoBeggar01: &quot;If I supply you with a peridot will you come Aego me?&quot;<br />
<br />
/who all AegoBeggar01 results in a 52 pally who is currently in KC.<br />
<br />
I am in WW.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless I am completely dumbfounded.  I told him no, that I was tired, and on a completely different continent.<br />
<br />
He wasn't rude or anything, but daamn use /who to the fullest :P<br />

I tell them go buy me the peridot and I will cast it and most only have plat.  I tell them I am short on peridots and they have to supply their own.<br />
<br />
Took care of that problem a lot.  Or if they are below level and want it (51 or less), I tell them its 4 peridots.<br />
<br />
This is only if I have time.  I have had to tell people no lately and I really do not like doing that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always tell them that sure, I can cast it on them as soon as I scribe the spell. Next question usually is, &quot;when are you going to scribe it&quot;. My answer is &quot;when I reach 60 in about 3 months time&quot;.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
When I hit 60, I don't think I will take any less than 100p + peri to aego someone unless I currently have c3. It's not the peridot cost, it's the mana cost. time == money/exp, mana == time therefore mana == money/exp.</div></div><hr />
