<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panteroo</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in a smaller guild on Fennin Ro.<br />
<br />
Currently we have 12 people at level 44-54 and are looking for &quot;something&quot; we could do. One idea popped up that we might be able to take Wuoshi in WL once everybody got above level 45 (probably 2-3 weeks down the road).<br />
<br />
The guild would like to get scales for our clerics/shamans for their Emerald Drake Scale Tunics.<br />
<br />
I was hoping for any insight about killing Wuoshi, effective tactics, appropriate number of people, general party make-ups, and any insight you folks may have.<br />
<br />
Here is the group we would most likely be taking with us:<br />
<br />
54 warrior<br />
50 warrior<br />
46 warrior<br />
46 warrior<br />
49 cleric<br />
50 cleric<br />
52 shaman<br />
53 druid<br />
46 druid<br />
46 mage<br />
52 Wizard<br />
49 bard<br />
<br />
*no enchanters of level in the guild  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif *<br />
<br />
we could also bring some high 30/low 40 people that would add a couple shamans, clerics, mage, druid, bard...<br />
<br />
Would our group be capable of taking out Wuoshi? While we may not be &quot;uber&quot; we do have extensive experience working together, but not necessarily in &quot;raid&quot; or high level encounters...<br />
<br />
any insight would be most appreciated<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaana</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Number is way low, level as well, I would be impressived if you guys could take him 20% down, basically I don't see your tanks getting any heal at all having a 50, 49 cleric, you would be feared/stunned the whole time.  Get an enchanter and a monk to do Fear/Hate is more doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panteroo</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, thank you for your honest and even blunt  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif answers...<br />
<br />
I guess we will set our sites a bit lower to something more obtainable to a guild of our stature.<br />
<br />
I guess, without doing any real homework, that i didn't consider Wuoshi among the &quot;epic&quot; type of encounters<br />
<br />
Thanks for you time,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kayleigh</div><div class="date">04-03-2001, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, consider that Nagafen is level 55 wizard with 32000 hit points, while Wuoshi is level 61-64 druid with (I assume) lots more hp.  Wuoshi is just a lot bigger and meaner.  And I have to agree - I don't think you could expect to take out Nagafen, so Wuoshi is straight out.<br />
<br />
Hate could probably be interesting with the right enchanters and puller.<br />

Back slowly away from the dragon.<br />
With the two groups you outlined, I would suggest possibly fighting wurms and such in Skyfire. You'll get exp, wont die, and you can get a feel for large mob encounters.<br />
Recruit lvl50+ players.<br />
Recruit Wizards<br />
Recruit Bards<br />
Recruit Clerics<br />
Recruit Rogues<br />
Recruit non-crack huffers<br />

We basically get 3 solid high level groups, buff up and port into WL and just own Wuoshi on the spot.  Once we did this and some other guild was gathering slowly for Wuoshi, they didn't know whether to be impressed or angry at us heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirriana_00</div><div class="date">04-19-2001, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right.  Woushi is owned the day he spawns on Fennin, and you won't get the chance to even see him before HoC/TMO/DoA kills it.<br />
<br />
I'd highly suggest TT rares for your guild.  It takes 1 good group, but is still fun and xp for two groups.  You get very nice drops when you get the rares, and you guys have the druids/bards to track the hunter/forager.<br />
<br />
My guild is fairly small and has done this for a few nights.  Gotten some loot that isn't dragon level, but is quite nice and a definite upgrade to what they had.<br />
<br />
You even get xp on the hunters/foragers until 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veraphie</div><div class="date">04-20-2001, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my guild's killed wuoshi 4 times now (i'm wearing an emerald dragonscale bp since higher guildies got their donals already) i think ... yes you need a lot higher levels, i think first time he was killed it was 4 groups of 55ish, and he was killed pretty easily. i know that usually only 1 or two deaths per wuoshi kill for my guild but we have 4 lvl 60 warriors and are mostly 56+ ... i don't even think he was attempted until we had 3 lvl 60s in guild and had been killing VS for quite a while. why don't you try Servilouss or however you spell his name in EJ first, he is easier.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif but yeah, naggy would be a much easier bet.<br />
<br />
on vaz i think so far we're the only guild capable of killing wuoshi and yup, it takes about an hour total to kill him, mostly transportation ... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zuht</div><div class="date">05-04-2001, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The short answer: No. =)<br />
<br />
Woushi and Severilous are both a pain without high levels and resists because of the stun (and the fear of course).  At 54, I resisted virtually all the fears, but even with 245 poison resist, I was stunned enough that it was difficult to heal effectively.<br />
<br />
While they still drop in the end with good people, the fight tends to last much longer than say, Talendor... because of the stuns the damage output of your tanks is going to be crippled.  Nuking is a bit difficult while stunned as well =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feyan</div><div class="date">05-06-2001, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm not sure here if this is advanced tactics or what, but my guild has killed Severlous multiple times without any trouble, I think that the following tactics are general knowledge on our server, but I'm more than happy to share them. The key to fighting any dragons , I mean ANY dragons is a little thing called bark potions. These can be bought at druid vendors in FV and Qeynos, perhaps other citys , but these are the only 2 I know of. Every participant in the dragon fight should have 5-6 bark potions. Basically what these potions do is root you in place and give negligible regen. The root basically nulls dragonfear, so you can wear gear keyed to 1 major resist. Don't bother with MR. Then you find a good pull place , buff, 30-36 people level 52-60 is suggested for Kunark dragons, and Wooshi. Then you send out puller,  just before the target gets in AE range everyone uses bark potions, tanks planting in front, casters and healers behind and pets further behind so they don't run up and stop target short. My guild usually forms a semicircle to hit Severlous from all sides. We usually have atleast 5 balanced groups , sometimes 6, minimum of 5 cleric, lots of mages, necros for pets, and lots of melee's, basically only wizards can nuke with lures, all other nukes resisted, cannot be slowed, but 60 shaman to Malo is big help. With this tactic we have killed Severlous 10+ times in the last 6 months, our only problem now is getting Severlous before another guild does , as Terris Thule has quite a few guilds  large enough to take him. As far as Wooshi is concerned he is basically identical to Severlous in his AE spells, but he is slightly higher level, as Severlous is 60, I think he is somewhere between 61-63.<br />
Severlous does AE slow by the way, but doesn't Complete heal as far as I've seen. He does have a very odd bug where if his pet is killed he sometimes charms like 5-10 people, really wierd, we only had this happen once, so leave his pet wolfie alone when fighting him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malathor</div><div class="date">05-08-2001, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just my experiance with Wuoshi. At lev 54 and with a buffed PR/MR of about 150/100 I was owned by the stuns and fears and could hardly get any heals off. At 55 and 175/125 things were alot better and I could get spells off quite well. So work on that resist gear! All in all Wuoshi is a Gimp, if you can take down Sev without too much difficulty you can probably take down Wuoshi as well.<br />
