<br />
We have tried CH chains, we have tried assist heals, and whilst we have got it down to about 2 pixels of health left (as in half of the s has health in it), we have not managed to kill it yet, and especially not in a satisfactory manner.<br />
<br />
So does anyone have a good way to kill him, because at this stage, even if he dies, it will not be a good fight we can reproduce and fine tune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">03-02-2002, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have all hide in the cubbies near tov, and the MT stand right near the portal thing (in ch range though). Train Sont onto the MT, defensive, have paly take the first heal (loh, so 1st ch cleric doens't get eaten) and then use a CH chain of like 4 clerics, 3 sec heals.<br />
<br />
Then do groups of 1 cleric/5 high dmg melee. And group heal when they get around 50% hp to keep them going. Try an unload dmg discs sooner rather than later too.<br />
<br />
When learning him, we kept getting him to &quot;S&quot; and then dying. The best advice I could give ya is... group heal your big damagers (keep them above 30% hp) and don't let that first MT die. Fight lasts about a minute, so don't be afraid to waste mana.<br />

A thing that might help is that he is slowable.  However, he often dispells himself so you need to recast slow often, however, that might be enough change in damage to make him end up dying</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if he is in the correct spot, yes you can hide from the AE. I've done it several times. Not much worth it, if you're group healing though, cause you're gonna get healed too.<br />

<br />
do as much damage as fast as possible, its a burn fight.<br />
<br />
but also keep him on one tank.  and dont' have the tank hug his nuts too close cuz he procs (or casts?) a 4 buff dispell, in addition to his AE dispell.  So when the main tank is right under sont's nuts, it dispells sontalak also.  malo, tash, slow, whatever ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
First time I was in the chain, everything was going well but I noticed that the cleric group I was in was getting low on health, since I had just CH'd I group healed.  Sontalak then turned to me and killed me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">03-04-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have druids/shamans heal the rot clerics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my experience, group heals generate way too much aggro in this fight. I tried one when he was at 40% HP, with a truckload of aggro built up, figuring it ought to be safe, and I still got owned like a nubi attacking Sargent Slate by mistake.<br />

Have him face the main tank towards TOV enterence and have everyone else behind him.  We start the fight off with him Harmonied so everyone can get into position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Splaktar</div><div class="date">03-11-2002, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we do it is similar to the DL style above.  We don't really do any debuffing.  The main tank needs to have 3-4 instant click buffs up and in first slots.  Sont's melee is quite weak, but his procs for 700 DD and constant dispells can hurt.  Just have all the clerics, druids, and shaman chain heal the MT with their best heals (DL type).  MT gets aggro, melee move in and disc right away more or less.  Melee should all have 1-2 instant click buffs on and we never heal anyone but the MT.<br />
<br />
He goes down very easily with 25 people now days, one time we managed to do Sont + Von in one pull/train... that was insane heh, no one died even.<br />

<br />
We use a fast-burn strategy, which means don't bother with a heal chain. Liberal use of group heals, unleash all damage disciplines from the start, nukers dump all mana. It is a 20 person kill if your damage output is high enough.<br />
