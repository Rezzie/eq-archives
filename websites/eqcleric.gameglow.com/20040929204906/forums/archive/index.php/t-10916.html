<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">argon</div><div class="date">11-20-2001, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild used to be on giant faction and we have done ToV West Wing a number of times. Recently however we decided to switch to dragon faction and are busy doing faction work so we can check out HoT...<br />
<br />
Problem is that several crucial members have had their playtimes cut for various reasons and are unable to spend a lot of time working on faction...I was told that it would be possible to just COH them past the entrance drakes and they could pull/hunt in HoT no problem, is this true? If so all we really need to begin with is a mage non-kos to dragons right? <br />
<br />
Also, is it true that HoT mobs are significantly easier than West wing? I have read a lot of posts from people talking about farming HoT with 18 good people...when we did West Wing we generally had a difficult time with low 20s (very few rogues, gaters/chealers etc.), and usually had high 20s-30 at our runs. Did we just have a bad time of it or is HoT easier?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any responses  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

As soon as possible you should move down and further into HoT to minimize the chance the CoV mobs outside aggro when someone opens the door, but it's entirely possible. HoT is kos to everyone anyways, once you're there, faction doesn't matter.<br />

last night, it does work.<br />
<br />
You can do pulls to the front with as low<br />
as 12-14 people (as long as 3-4 of them<br />
are clerics).<br />
<br />
Important: If you CoH people in, you MUST<br />
be past the front doors, at least in the<br />
pit area.  Cause someone WILL open the door <br />
and pissed off Drakes WILL come in and eat<br />
you up.<br />

<br />
If you're fighting an AoE mob up top and anyone opens the door, Zemm and his buddies will assist the HoT mob and you'll wipe.  If you have a KoS person and they get too near the doorway, Zemm will aggro and they'll kill every KoS person there.  If you're fighting when that happens, you'll wipe.  Clear the two static wurms in the pit up top without your KoS people and drop down into the pit...  CoH them there, not before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminar</div><div class="date">11-21-2001, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">thats true.. if you do go deeper in youll be fine.. its if your sitting at the door area that its very dangeriuse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dahktur</div><div class="date">11-22-2001, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Side note to all this.  If a party member is KoS, and near the door, and the door opens (causing the door guards to storm in and lay the smack down)... pray you dont have a bard in the group with this person.  They will turn and munch the bard due to aggro from his songs on the offending person (Saw this happen from the &quot;dragging corpse&quot; feature  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">11-23-2001, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">MOBs in the east wing and west wing are virtually identical. Whatever number of people it takes you to kill a MOB in west wing, take the same number for the east wing. The main difference is that there are fewer total MOBs in the east wing, and its very very dark, even with ultravision you can't see very far at all...<br />

If you nail their shoulders to the wall in the middle the entrance to HoT then they will be okay (had a KoS chanter in today).  If they are melee though it may be difficult to hit from back on the wall despite the large size of some of the mobs.<br />
<br />
Overall though it really is not worth it to have a KoS person in and not be at least in the pit.  I think the two guardians are on a 20 minute timer, but I don't remember, it might be longer, break their spawns up good before dropping into the pit and having the KoS people CoHed.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, and sometimes your casters and healers can hide on the opposite side of the center wall to avoid some of the AoEs (although generally not the nastier ones)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">11-25-2001, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, last I recall, mobs in the rest of TOV will run away.<br />
<br />
*Nothing* in HOT runs. It stays until it dies or sometimes they try to gate. This does make it easier, imo.<br />
<br />
And there is some better pathing on HOT than on the West side. (I'm thinking of that junction room on the west side with the 4 wurms and 3 drakes all stacked in a pile in center of the room.)<br />
<br />
And yes, it's NP to do HOT with KOS people. The only important thing is to CLEAR the pit first, then COTH to there and you will be fine.<br />

If careful you can make every pull a single pull.<br />
So it's quite easy to do HoT with 18 people.  I even pull in HoT sometimes with my warrior, it's fun and I don't die as often as frail monks  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  I do West/North wing w/ my cleric.<br />
<br />
We don't let KOS people come on our raids just because it's always a pain in the ass.  It's certainly doable tho, just expect a few wipe out/trains from Zemm if you fight near door.  Because someone from another guild or someone accidentally will open the door.<br />
