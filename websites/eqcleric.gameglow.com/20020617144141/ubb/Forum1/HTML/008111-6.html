</FONT><HR>Yea, I am getting that feeling since the release of SoL. What feeling? I getting the impression from other clerics in this thread as well. What feeling is that again? Clerics in the exping realm (and lets face it, with the advent of AASP we are now ALL in the exping realm again) have become marginalzed in our own designed role. I like to call it the "Break Glass for Clerics in Case of Raid" syndrome. As I said before, clerics have changed VERY little since the advent of EQ three years ago. This is both a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing because we have stayed a stable solid class whose role has not changed one itoa, a curse becuase the GAME has changed and with it most classes have been increased in capability. As a cleric in an exp group three years later I regularly have FIVE of my eight standard exp loadout spell gems filled with PRE-RoK spells. Sure, folks like the big hp buffs and the comfort zone of having a res available without hunting one up but, as someone said before a decently equipped shaman or druid can handily do the same job when it comes to exping and quite frankly more and more folks are prefering it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I am very depressed to find that clerics appear to be complaining about these obviously useful new spells and changes. <P>Try playing a class that started out completely useless and is going to stay that way. The grass always appears to be greener on the other side, but it never is. <P>Don't complain, this is a positive step. You will have a right to complain when you are neglected.

</FONT><HR> Hmm sounds great  Means when all these newbs get to 30 lvl they will be thinking Heals?  No way  I save my mana for rezzes.  Want a class defining abilty for clerics it is HEALING  rezzing is what you do when there is a screw up  It should not be made into a free gift at lower lvls.  If you start thinking I can rez at 14 then who worries if someone dies and be truthful  You have seen people who didnt learn to use their characters at lower levels  We all have and we wont group with them again.  Well this will just add to the list of people I dont want to group with post 45 lvl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>With the proposed changes, including the paladin 75% rez, does anyone feel that it continues to diminish the value of the cleric epic.  The change to Ragefire, from my experience (168 hour camp spread over and not including downtime of a server reset and emergency patch) will make epics harder to get by frequency and time demands.  <BR>I would like to see the effect of the epic improved somewhat..perhaps reduced or no rez effect.<P>Any thoughts...pls no flames.<P>Kraayt<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I'm quite amazed at some of the responses on this thread.<P>These changes are an improvement, don't deny this simply because they do not affect you! Yes it is only the beginning they do need to make better changes post 50, but don't expect them to only change the post 50 cleric, they have to address the pre 50 cleric aswell.<P>So get off your high horses for a minute and have a sensible look.<P>Soloing as a cleric, well, does it really matter that much? You surely knew three years ago and after 50 or more levels that this class couldn't solo successfully forever, yet now this is the main reason you want the class changed? Thats sad.<P>The cleric comes second to a Shaman, (never a druid), in many situations, simply because on top of those Heals, the Shaman such lovely buffs for the melees. If my warrior has a choice of a partner, it is ALWAYS a shaman, at any level, from 1 to 60.<P>This my friends, is the problem that needs addressing, Clerics offer Heals and Rez's, this is nothing, this is useless, this benefits a good melee only marginally. They need something new to offer to a group/partnership.<P>They don't need massive improvements to soloing, they just need what they should've had with SoL, something to keep them up alongside a Shaman as a Warrior's best friend.<P>Now, complain all you like, most of what has been said so far, (and yes I read every post even though I'm a Warrior), is complete rubbish, simply because you are damning what VI is trying to do without offering any alternatives.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Something I've not quite seen on the board, is I'd like to see Khura's Focusing (group focus) not overwrite Blessed Armor of the Risen.  <P>Too many times to count I've had to click off Khura's Focusing, re-mem BAoR, recast it on myself, and remem some other spell because the melee group I was in had gotten Group Focus.  The mana regen is more important to me on raids than focus.  If I want focus cast on me, I wouldn't cast BAoR on myself.  That or make them stack, but don't make Khura's overwrite BAoR please.<P>I'd also like to see the undead dots efficiency improved just a little more.  Epitaph of life made it possible to solo say bats in Maidens Eye.  But the downtime is really atrocious.  I'm not asking to improve our live line, just make our undead damage a little more effective.  There's few enough undead in Everquest anyways.<P>I like the reduced casting time on nukes.  Frequently the only reason I nuke living mobs is for faction hits.  Right now most mobs are dead before I get a nuke off.  This might help to fix that.<P>Some small improvements in AAXP abilities would be nice.  Like many here, after MGB, what else is really worth exping for?  I'd be better served leveling up almost any other class on my 2nd machine for the benefit I'd get by earning AAXP points.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>OOC.<P>1. The DD/Nuke spells changes I am neutral or slightly positive towards. They will help lower level clerics, and do no harm at higher levels. They might mean a cleric can have a bit of fun with one nuke and expect to land it more quickly sometimes, without actually affecting their power significantly at all.<P>2. The new rez spells over 29 I am also neutral towards. I do not see there is a strong need for these changes, but also I think they will be welcomed by some, and do no harm.<P>3. Introducing rez spells below 29 is not, in my humble opinion, a good idea. Not only is it not needed, I do not believe it will have any effect on cleric groupability, but it will mean lower and lower level characters will expect resurrections as a matter of course, and higher level clerics get enough pestering for them as it is. Furthermore, it removes the great target and sense of achievement of finally becoming a rez-capable cleric at 29, it feels like it trivializes the spell a little.<P>4. I would make the same observations re Paladins, but using 39 instead of 29 for clerics.<P>5. The only place a cleric struggles to get groups is in the 29-33 range, because in that range only, clerics are a poor choice next to druids/shamans of the same level. Dropping Superior Heal from 34 to 29 would fix that perfectly.<P>/bow<P>Felishanna Secretlight<BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Heroes of the Old Lands<BR>Lanys T'Vyl.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>This is just my opinion of course..<P>If what you are trying to do with giving clerics new rezzes is to help with grouping in the younger levels..it is not the answer.  (I am not saying new rezzes are bad in any way.)  But the way I see it, groups are still going to look for a druid/shaman to group with, and look for a cleric to rez them if they die. <P>What I would *like* to see is to take minor healing out of the clerics spell lineup.  Start them off with light healing, and work up from there.  Clerics are *supposed* to be the best healers, and in those hell levels (20ish?) it would give the clerics a slight edge in healing power.  Groups are still going to look for druid/shaman for the snare/sow/slow.  <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14272" TARGET=_blank>Phalia Kordain</A><BR>57th Templar<BR>Lords of Belterra<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It's obvoius that Varent is trying to remove many of the barriers to lower level dungeoning.  They are giveing Druids/Wizzies the intrazone Evak in the teens now (Normally had in 57) and giveing Druids/Pallys rez way earlier.  This is all kinds of good.<P>Next, perhaps, they will look at some of the lower dungeons that are unused.  Changing the spacing of some MOBs would make some more usable I suspect.  <P>As a druid, I think it's a good thing that you guys get nuke upgrades.

</FONT><HR> I may be getting a little paranoid here but the last time verant asked us about changes all they did was NERF clerics to shreds...is this going to be the same?

</FONT><HR>First, it's great to see clerics getting some adjustment.  It has seemed, to many of us (based both on these posts and in my conversations with other clerics) that the class suffers from one huge misconception - most RPGers think of clerics in terms of the old DnD system.  In DnD, clerics are nearly as good a fighter as warriors are, having only some restrictions regarding what weapons they can use (blunt vs sharp) and about 20% fewer hit points.<P>I, and many friends I know who have clerics in EQ, felt that the cleric would be able to melee and solo better than it has turned out - this, in turn, has made it less interesting to play clerics.  They are more like priests than clerics.  It would be extremely interesting to know how many clerics, as a percentage of classes, there are in the game.<P>While these changes are good, I think you still need to go further to start to bring clerics back up to equality with some of the super-classes (shammys, necros and paladins).<P>First, if clerics are "the best" undead nukers in the game (and they should be), why do the nukes and undead DoTs (which were a great add also, thank you) not do the same kind of damage that wizards (recognized as the best direct nukers in the game) can do vs. normal MOBs?  Where are the 1200HP undead nukes?<P>Second, revise the damange cap that applies to clerics and let us melee!<P>Lastly, regarding the new nuke changes, they are great - but there is still one major drawback.  The agro rate.  Clerics already have a very rapid agro of the mob in a group, because they're healing the party.  Now while the mob should be unhappy with the cleric for undoing all that damage the mob had just so viciously done to the tank, it shouldn't mean that if I start nuking a mob after the tank has built up the agro, that the mob makes me the favorite target.<P>This effect will multiply for those clerics who mem several nukes for "chain-nuking" - we'll build up agro so fast, that even with taunts, the tanks won't be able to pull the mobs off us (unlike other caster classes like wizzies and mages).  How come this healing/nuking agro algorithm doesn't apply to shammys (who are almost as good at healing as clerics, especially when you consider chloroblast, et.al.)?<P>So, bottom line IMO - this is good stuff, but keep going.  You have a long ways to go towards bring clerics back even to equality with other classes in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunately when I started playing EQ a little over 2 years ago, the only thing I knew about Clerics I drew from AD&D. It is in fact the reason I started a Cleric, as through out my pen and paper gaming career I had always been one.<P>I always viewed a Cleric as a "warrior priest" able to swing a hammer or mace, heal the injured, and bane to undead everywhere.<P>To that extent the EQ Cleric left me disapointed.  But after 2 + years of playing a Cleric, I've learnt to love the class and understand it's strengths and it's weaknesses.<P>More and more, through the past 2 years, I have seen our class become marginalized to the point of extinction.  I remember a time when Clerics were wanted in experience groups, following Velious and then Luclin, this began to change ... quite simply we are no longer just not needed, we simply arn't wanted.<P>With the gear that can be obtained by melee classes, and the ability of every other class in the game to solo to a certain extent.  The Cleric is left lfg at the zoneline.<P>Our one refuge left is in the raiding arena, and that is only because of two reasons ... <P>1)  Complete Heal<BR>2)  You tend to have a higher % of deaths on raids, and a 56 % res is desired.<P>More and more higher level Clerics are becoming raid bots, or we log in to raid and nothing else.  The frustration of lfg, dying to live greens, trying to find a blue undead we can solo on a bar of mana thats not too far from a zone line ... the class is folding.<P>More than any other class I can think of, the Cleric class has remained almost the same as it was pre Kunark.  There has been little growth, we are the truely static class of EQ.<P>And it's stagnating.<P>This is the first non negative change to the Cleric class in the past year and a half (other than the tweaking of MoK, which we're still not happy with).<P>And so far yes, it's a good change, I'm happy for our younger brothers and sisters of the clergy.<P>The last time we were paid attention to, it wasn't a nice thing.  So yes we're very glad that someone is looking at the Cleric class and making some changes that don't cripple us even more.  But it also shows that while you're aware of this board, what's being said here is being ignored.<P>Someone mentioned they didn't want this said, that we should be grateful that a Verant representive took the time to post on our boards ... and I am, I honestly am.<P>But it still has to be said.<P>What you've done in no way addresses the issue's with the Cleric class.<P>Come away from this thread understanding that more work needs to be done, if nothing else, and as a paying customer of VI, I'll be happy.<P>1) We are no longer desired in groups.<P>2) We cannot solo, fine.  This was something we sacrificed because of our desirability in groups.  But we're no longer wanted there.<P>3) Our Mark spells at the upper levels are worthless. The resist rate, and dmg incurred from MoR needs to be addressed.<P>4) Our melee and dodge caps need to be looked at.<P>5) Our heals post Luclin no longer cut it.<P>And ...<P>6) I'll give you my first born for a group AC buff.  ^_^<P><BR><P>------------------<BR><B>Aalamdara A'shani</B><BR>Warrior Priestess of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.darkblood.com" TARGET=_blank>Darkblood</A> <BR><I>Solusek Ro</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Cassandra:<BR><B>OK, I just thought I'd like to give my opinion here as well.<P>Personally, I feel somewhat cheated by the proposed Rez changes as I've always seen the Rez line as something special. <P>I've worked hard, stuck at it and just got my level 29 Revive spell and I *finally* feel like a proper Cleric. I've even had a few random tells for a Revive, and someone even gave me 10 plat for saving them a CR. As I said, I feel like I have achieved something special.<P>However, if the Revive line gets watered down and spread out over such a huge level range, then it just won't feel the same anymore. Worse, if it gets handed over to other classes at as low a level as the mid twenties, it would seem to lower the Revive spells to being nothing more than mere trinkets. <BR>Cassandra - The Lady Cleric<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>I must agree 110%.  When I hit 29  I finally felt like I had truely become a cleric.  With these new rez lines, any alt can rez without putting in the time it takes to become a true "master of the tomes".   We may even become the 'popular' class for a while, like the druid.  I wouldn't mind upping the percentage on the rez, but to lower the lvls just stinks.   <P>If this goes live I see a lot more 'untrained' clerics, and a lot less groups for those of us who really work at it.  After all, now you will be able to rez at 10% before you get your last name!  Would you want some lvl 19 cleric rezzing you? Would you trust you will 'come to'  in a safe area where you are protected since you are without most of your HP and mana?  I wouldn't.   <P>With Time comes Wisdom.  Keep it at 29. Raise the percentage at 34 and move the higher levels in line with that change.<P>Another problem in my view is giving them away to other classes really weakens the clerics.  It used to be our calling card.  <P>If I could have one single thing, it would be better soloing against undead.  <P>If I could have two, it would be more powerful rez between 29 and 39 and better nuking against undead.<BR><P>------------------<BR>-----<P>Alerias<BR>Cleric of 30 moons<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps this change was not intended to balance the classes. Perhaps this change addresses another matter that VI see's as a problem, perhaps the issue of people avoiding dungeons like the plague. Hmmmm....<P>More than once I've said that a few changes would help to get lower levels ---even twinks--- back into dungeons. My ideas were as follows:<P>1. Lower the level of Rez to 14 or 19.<BR>2. Make Summon Corpse usable at 12 or 16.<BR>3. Make all dungeons bindable outside.<BR>4. Expand both Summon Corpse and Rez to other classes.<BR>5. Remove or Greatly reduce the xp penalty in dungeons.<P>My logic? well, there are two things imho that keep people out of dungeons: <BR>1. You die more- therefore lose much more xp and time.<BR>2. Most dungeons are far from anywhere you may bind--losing yet more time.<BR>These 2 factors cut out 2 major groups of players. Powergamers won't go near them, because they lose xp faster than they can gain it, no matter how good the ZEM is. Casual Players don't use them because they take a long time to get to with no garuantee of a group when you get there, and a long, time consuming CR when they die-- If you only have an hour online, you don't want to spend 50 minutes of it traveling to the dungeon then back to your corpse.<P>So, imagine my surprise when I checked the boards this morning and saw these changes. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw that Rez had been radicaly lowered in level, and effectively given to another class too, given that it's at a lower level for pally's now than it started for clerics.<P>In fact, I don't think Rez should be a balance factor for Clerics at all-- beyond the minimal value of a fairly well used utility spell. It's like saying that Group Gates are an important aspect of Wizard balance, or Waterstone Summoning is important for Mage Balance. It has some value, but it's not a big balance issue. It DOES, however, help younger clerics with grouping, as they do have a utility function to compete with the other healers's SOW, DS, TP, Slow, and DOT. And yes, that one spell does make up for all 5 of those catagories quite nicely in my opinion.<P>You see, it's my opinion that clerics should be the best healers, not the only healers. Before level 39, other than lacking a bit in utility, Clerics are balanced well with the other healers. When the other healers did not get anymore healing upgrades till over 50, but clerics got complete heal, it fell out of balance and stayed there. When the balancing does come down from on high, I expect clerics will be as disappointed in their balance as warriors were when the Melee's got it. I think enchanters might feel that way a bit as well. All 3 of the Holy Trinity are so superior in thier area as to exclude others from filling the gap without them, and caster balance-- if it follows the path that Melee balance did-- will see those that are lacking brought up into line with the H3, rather than see the H3 brought down. <P>But, what if you were interested in balancing all 3 healing classes? <P>Well, first of all, you'd need to increase the healing ability of Shamans and/or Druids beyond the effectiveness of a 24 cleric after level 34 and before level 51. I don't know why the Direct Healing line was stopped at this point, but it should have been continued in regular intervals right to level 60. Clerics were balanced in healing as they were 5 levels ahead, and have an inate bonus to healing spells.<P>Now we get into alternate healing spells. Shaman and Druids get Regen, which needs to be balanced in the Cleric line. I'd like to see Complete Heal changed to a 5 or 10 minute Recast, but with a 2 second or so cast time. Not something you can use more than once a fight, and not every fight, but still very good. Perhaps the Mana cost could be looked at, since I expect the Direct healing line to get progressivly better in mana/healing. Possibly add another version of this spell a bit lower, Say at level 19, so they can be cycled like Divine Aura and Barrier.<P>Now, the Final straw, The Healing over time spells. These are where the real healing power should lie. Use the same kind of progression as the Direct healing spells-- Only less mana, more healing-- but upgrade only every 10 levels, with the Shaman and Druid always being at least 1 spell lower. Between the 5 level advantage of the direct healing, and the healing bonus, and these superior Heal over time spells, the Clerics would hold a clear--but not over powering edge. Perhaps make the Druid line only usable outdoors, but closer to the cleric line. <P>Now balancing is nearly complete. Look at the 3 classes in terms of Utility and Buffs. I'd say the clerics come up a tiny bit short on utility--though rez is a big one-- but their buffs are fine, with maybe a few niche buffs to make up for things like Damage Sheilds and Sow. For utility maybe we could see a bit of Self only heals, and a new Word of something series with extremly low cast times that are decent AE Debuffs for AC and STR. Possibly a short lived Silence type spell for use on enemy casters, a lower single target, and a higher level AE version would be good.<P>The reason all clerics do is heal is because they are the only one's who can. They should have a healthy backup role other than Master AC/HP buffer. They do have decent DD's, and even better against Undead. All they need is a bit of combat utility to round out thier aresenal to compete with Shaman Slows and Druid Evacs and Damage Sheilds. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

It DOES, however, help younger clerics with grouping, as they do have a utility function to compete with the other healers's SOW, DS, TP, Slow, and DOT. And yes, that one spell does make up for all 5 of those catagories quite nicely in my opinion.<P>You see, it's my opinion that clerics should be the best healers, not the only healers. Before level 39, other than lacking a bit in utility, Clerics are balanced well with the other healers. When the other healers did not get anymore healing upgrades till over 50, but clerics got complete heal, it fell out of balance and stayed there. When the balancing does come down from on high, I expect clerics will be as disappointed in their balance as warriors were when the Melee's got it. I think enchanters might feel that way a bit as well. All 3 of the Holy Trinity are so superior in thier area as to exclude others from filling the gap without them, and caster balance-- if it follows the path that Melee balance did-- will see those that are lacking brought up into line with the H3, rather than see the H3 brought down. <P>But, what if you were interested in balancing all 3 healing classes? <P>Well, first of all, you'd need to increase the healing ability of Shamans and/or Druids beyond the effectiveness of a 24 cleric after level 34 and before level 51. I don't know why the Direct Healing line was stopped at this point, but it should have been continued in regular intervals right to level 60. Clerics were balanced in healing as they were 5 levels ahead, and have an inate bonus to healing spells.<P>Now we get into alternate healing spells. Shaman and Druids get Regen, which needs to be balanced in the Cleric line. I'd like to see Complete Heal changed to a 5 or 10 minute Recast, but with a 2 second or so cast time. Not something you can use more than once a fight, and not every fight, but still very good. Perhaps the Mana cost could be looked at, since I expect the Direct healing line to get progressivly better in mana/healing. Possibly add another version of this spell a bit lower, Say at level 19, so they can be cycled like Divine Aura and Barrier.<P>Now, the Final straw, The Healing over time spells. These are where the real healing power should lie. Use the same kind of progression as the Direct healing spells-- Only less mana, more healing-- but upgrade only every 10 levels, with the Shaman and Druid always being at least 1 spell lower. Between the 5 level advantage of the direct healing, and the healing bonus, and these superior Heal over time spells, the Clerics would hold a clear--but not over powering edge. Perhaps make the Druid line only usable outdoors, but closer to the cleric line. <P>Now balancing is nearly complete. Look at the 3 classes in terms of Utility and Buffs. I'd say the clerics come up a tiny bit short on utility--though rez is a big one-- but their buffs are fine, with maybe a few niche buffs to make up for things like Damage Sheilds and Sow. For utility maybe we could see a bit of Self only heals, and a new Word of something series with extremly low cast times that are decent AE Debuffs for AC and STR. Possibly a short lived Silence type spell for use on enemy casters, a lower single target, and a higher level AE version would be good.<P>The reason all clerics do is heal is because they are the only one's who can. They should have a healthy backup role other than Master AC/HP buffer. They do have decent DD's, and even better against Undead. All they need is a bit of combat utility to round out thier aresenal to compete with Shaman Slows and Druid Evacs and Damage Sheilds. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps this change was not intended to balance the classes. Perhaps this change addresses another matter that VI see's as a problem, perhaps the issue of people avoiding dungeons like the plague. Hmmmm....<P>More than once I've said that a few changes would help to get lower levels ---even twinks--- back into dungeons. My ideas were as follows:<P>1. Lower the level of Rez to 14 or 19.<BR>2. Make Summon Corpse usable at 12 or 16.<BR>3. Make all dungeons bindable outside.<BR>4. Expand both Summon Corpse and Rez to other classes.<BR>5. Remove or Greatly reduce the xp penalty in dungeons.<P>My logic? well, there are two things imho that keep people out of dungeons: <BR>1. You die more- therefore lose much more xp and time.<BR>2. Most dungeons are far from anywhere you may bind--losing yet more time.<BR>These 2 factors cut out 2 major groups of players. Powergamers won't go near them, because they lose xp faster than they can gain it, no matter how good the ZEM is. Casual Players don't use them because they take a long time to get to with no garuantee of a group when you get there, and a long, time consuming CR when they die-- If you only have an hour online, you don't want to spend 50 minutes of it traveling to the dungeon then back to your corpse.<P>So, imagine my surprise when I checked the boards this morning and saw these changes. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw that Rez had been radicaly lowered in level, and effectively given to another class too, given that it's at a lower level for pally's now than it started for clerics.<P>In fact, I don't think Rez should be a balance factor for Clerics at all-- beyond the minimal value of a fairly well used utility spell.

</FONT><HR>I rellly like the chnges: some other upgrades or changes i'd love to see are:<BR>1)  Dots at least fro every other clase haev WAY WAY better damage to mana ratio's then DD's yet OUR bets undead only(highly resticted) DOT is basicaly teh same ration as our best DD, I'd love to see a big upgrade to our dots.  I'v alwasy felt clerics should REALLLY kick Undead.<BR>2)  a new heal along the lines of 2k hp 5sec cast, fro some anount of mana guessing 400 to 500 to balace it.  Somethign that whoudl trlu make us the masters of healing, give us the ability to actuayl save a enchter the gets hard arg for a short wile in a place like new CT etc.<P><P>------------------<BR>Venerable Netorbesnom Spellbinder,<BR>High Priest of the Companions, The Tribunal.<BR> <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12138" TARGET=_blank>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12138</A> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>i hear everyone talking about the need to lable the boxes casue it can get confusing blah blah blah.... no need as long as the cleric knows what spell he is casting then thats it. the higher the lvl the better the rez period. as a caster i dun care wheather you know what my spells do or not as long as i know what they do. as a melee i thank the heavens whenever i can get a rez. <P>as for the ideas about up grading  rezzes would be nice to have the AA skil upgraded its usless, 3 days recast time realy doesn;t help much.  would have made more sence to reduce that to a 96% rezz with no effects and  reduce the recast time on it considerable.  <P>on a side note i see a lot of benifits going to players that are just starting their charcs. new lower lvl spells and getting existing ones improved etc.... what about the ones that have already been there done that are they getting anything? i have a 56 Cleric and so far these changes really don;t do much for me and all the rest of the 56+ Clerics out there. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Alerias:<BR><B> <BR>I must agree 110%.  When I hit 29  I finally felt like I had truely become a cleric.  With these new rez lines, any alt can rez without putting in the time it takes to become a true "master of the tomes".   We may even become the 'popular' class for a while, like the druid.  I wouldn't mind upping the percentage on the rez, but to lower the lvls just stinks.   <P>If this goes live I see a lot more 'untrained' clerics, and a lot less groups for those of us who really work at it.  After all, now you will be able to rez at 10% before you get your last name!  Would you want some lvl 19 cleric rezzing you? Would you trust you will 'come to'  in a safe area where you are protected since you are without most of your HP and mana?  I wouldn't.   <P>With Time comes Wisdom.  Keep it at 29. Raise the percentage at 34 and move the higher levels in line with that change.<P>Another problem in my view is giving them away to other classes really weakens the clerics.  It used to be our calling card.  <BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Bah.. if you need 'wisdom' to rez.. then we should probably hold it off until the 30s or 40s then! 29 isn't that hard to achieve either. <P>But I don't really think that. Revive is not a class defining spell, nor is it that powerful. Nor is it a very prestigous spell, I was asked to do about a dozen of them while I was 29-39. Heck, the only time I get asked for revives often is when I'm in EC, where low levels tend to die far from there corpse.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42628" TARGET=_blank>Quotison Iachwer</A></B><BR>47th Level Dwarven Cleric<BR>Tarew Marr Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
