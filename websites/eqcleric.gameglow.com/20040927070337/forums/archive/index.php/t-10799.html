&lt;ul&gt;<br />
 Silverwing Roaming enchanter dragon, area effect is gravity flux with a DD component. Low melee output. AE can be easily countered with Heroic Bond, and a Celestial Elixir on the primary melee target will keep them alive. Only real problem this dragon poses is when he gates. Should that happen, camp off aggro before the summons get you.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Hoshkar Roaming shaman dragon, area effect is disease based, minor DoT with large DD component. The DoT is not worth counteracting other than permitting the Celestial line. Heroic Bond, Word of Restoration, Complete Heal are the primary tools against Hoshkar.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Xygoz Static bard dragon, area effect silence with minor DD component, low melee output. Remedy, Celestial line primary tools given their short cast times. You can reasonably get through a Xygoz fight casting no heals at all.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Druushk Static druid dragon, area effect lightning, high DD. I have found Word of Redemption most effective against Druushk.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Nexxona Static necromancer dragon, area effect acid DoT with medium DD component. Word of Restoration, Word of Redemption very effective. I do not recall whether Celestial line sticks over the dot.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Phara Dar Static enchanter/cleric dragon, area effect stun with minor DD and debuff. Similar tactics to Xygoz, fast casting heals to slip between stuns. I have had Phara Dar fights where no heal was needed.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Guardian Wurms Roaming level 60/61 mobs on a 2 minute respawn. Come in melee and caster variants; melee can hit as hard as 1500 and casters are debuffing Nag or Vox types. Some can cast Reality Warp, which ports target to zone-in. Some GW's are multi-splits, wurms that have instant respawn when they die (had a 5-split once, was a very long fight). Heal as normal but keep a decent mana reserve in case of a splitter.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Racnars Static level 60 raptors on a 2 minute respawn, come in linked pairs. Melee only, moderate damage. Usually kite one around while killing the other, if you have manuvering space.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
 Drakes of various types Static level 60/61 mobs on 2 minute respawn. Area effect casters, most cast Reality Warp. Nearly all see invis. Pain in the butt to heal against, best avoided if possible.&lt;/li&gt;[/list]<br />
<br />
Specific tactics on moving around inside VP and pulling the statics are exercises left to the reader.<br />
<br />
You cannot gate or port out of VP, which leaves two ways to get people out: Ressurection, and zone portals.<br />
<br />
To ress someone out have a resser inside and one at their bind point. They die out, leave a corpse at bind, get ressed in to get gear, get ressed out to bind corpse. If they want to take dueling deaths (wimps) keep a close eye on the clock. If you cannot figure out how to get the last cleric out of VP then you should probably stick to killing frogloks...<br />
<br />
Zone portals are in the lairs of the four static dragons, and are guarded by drakes or racnars. The Phara Dar portal leads to the Fairy island in Plane of Sky, the other portals lead to Freeport. In general, the Druushk portal is the easiest one to use. Click on a zone portal to exit.<br />
<br />
This zone can be great fun or incredibly boring, depending on how you choose to fight it. Happy hunting!<br />

First off thanks for that information.  As my server is only now (yeah we are slow in starting this for whatever reaons :P) starting to explore VP it has been an exciting new challenge.  We've killed the 1st 3 dragons you've mentioned and would have killed Druushk if not for some fluke thing that happened (side note, I heard of 1 try on Phara dar and the people there got waxed, and I think a try on Nexxona after a decent portion of the raid had left already so also lost that fight...I missed the latest raid and those attempts on those dragons) Anyway, might I ask what target numbers you try to get for resists when fighting these things?  There is the rumor that resists &gt; 255 is actually harmful and just weird things that I've seen where I've seem to resist better with &lt; 200 resists then &gt; 200.  But yeah, I will say that Druushk's DD portion of the AE is rather brutal.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
My usual resists for the dragons:<br />
<br />
Silverwing: MR 145<br />
Hoshkar: DR 235<br />
Xygoz: MR 105 FR 135<br />
Druushk: MR 245<br />
Nexxona: MR 130 FR 125<br />
Phara Dar: MR 145<br />
<br />
Congratulations on killing Hoshkar, he is in our opinion the toughest of the dragons in VP!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">03-06-2001, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the 255 roll-over for resists, in my experience having more than 255 is not harmful.<br />
<br />
- Last few Hoshkar attempts I've had well over 300 resist disease with a bard (158 unbuffed RD, I drink a potion anyway in case bard is out of range or I don't get song effect) and was in good shape with the AE.  Every death was by melee.  (Still in shock we finally killed him hehe)<br />
- For Xygoz I've had base 150 resist magic and don't quite hit 255 without a bard (215-225).  I'm silenced a lot at 215-255 resist.  With a bard in the group, and resist magic well over 255, I resist Xygoz's silence almost reliably enough to choose when to heal.  (If the bard doesn't stop the resist song to juggle songs--and find out they're silenced now too)<br />
- For Trakanon, with DMF and buffs, if you have a bard it's hard to not go over 255.  Past few trak raids I've been with bards and I don't think I've had to cast a single group heal.<br />
<br />
It's my experience, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Is there something Im missing?<br />

Wow, Swamp of No Hope? We have only used the Druushk and Phara portals, so I only personally know of Freeport (right by the boat dock) and Sky.<br />
<br />
I'll have to check out the Nexxona portal this weekend and see where it goes...<br />
