<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night, in fear, was listening to an ooc argument between the other cleric there and a few druids.  They felt that clerics are way too powerful -- that &quot;everyone&quot; wants a cleric and that druids get whatever openings are left after the clerics get the &quot;choice&quot; spots.  That got me to thinking.<br />
<br />
I remember in my early 20's when I couldn't buy a group -- everyone wanted a shaman or druid because the extra 30 points I could heal wasn't worth it, they wanted the buffs.  And the druids didn't want groups, they could solo -- which I couldn't.<br />
<br />
So there is no doubt that we pay our dues to get to the higher levels... whereas druids can pretty much solo into their 30's, and beyond now with Kunark.  It seems that every perk has a cost -- and with druids it is their lack of powerful heal spells.  They still have a lot of utility, just can't function well in primary healer roles when you're fighting &quot;tough stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
But does that make us &quot;too powerful?&quot;  I'm sure everyone has had this argument before -- class envy is always rearing it's ugly head.  I play several other characters as well, and I don't feel personally that a cleric is that powerful.  In my regular group, the enchanter and wizard have more hp's than me at 49.  I do the least damage, as well -- I am pretty much buffing, stunning, and healing.  Luckily we discovered Burning Woods so I can throw fear, too -- at least I feel needed there  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  <br />
<br />
Am I essential to the group?  I hope so.  Am I too powerful?  I don't think so.  How do others feel?<br />

I hope you are seriously kidding about this.  I have a druid/wizard/enchanter friend in my guild and I easily have more hp than they do (without hp buff).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">37 Cleric here, and a friend to many druids as well. Druids have their &quot;Power Years&quot; in the low and mid-levels, where cleric have their &quot;Power Years&quot; in the later part of the game.<br />
<br />
At 37, I have paid my dues putting up with no SoW, no Soloing, no Ports, no invis, poor nukes, etc. etc. etc. My healing abilities are really starting to shine, and once I hit 39, I will be set for a long time.<br />
<br />
I think most druids now realize that they will have to pay a price for the convenience they had at lower levels. That price is Not being as good of a healer as a cleric.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand, if A druid isn't needed to Nuke, there are many other valuable things that a druid can do. Damage Shields, Evac, SoW, Nukes, DoTs and so forth. Just because we heal much better does not mean that they have no position in a group. It's just that with the low number of clerics out there, most of them got used to being the primary healer at levels 1-40. At 40 or higher, a Cleric is Much more suited for the task.<br />

<br />
Druids are jack-of-all trades.  They do not fulfil a  designated role, they can do bits of everything.  They can heal a bit, they can nuke a bit, they can DoT and they can fight a bit (but can't tank).  They also have a limited amount of crowd control (charm etc).<br />
<br />
Clerics are specialists.  We specialise in healing and keeping party members alive though a limited crowd control (atone, stun, root)<br />
<br />
Druids in the higher levels will find it more hard to get into a group, simply because they don't have a simple defined role in a group.<br />
<br />
Will they be asked to be a healer in a group? maybe as backup.  Will they be expected to act as a wizard-type nuker? Only a little.  Will they have to use crowd control?  Only if there's no enchanter.<br />
<br />
At higher levels, the difference between the hybrids and the pure classes becomes greater.<br />
<br />
Are clerics too powerful? No. Our aim is to keep the party alive.  What is the druids role? depends on what element of a group is missing.  Can druids fulfil a cleric's role in a party?  Only if the party is in a very safe spot and can easily cope without a healer at all.<br />

I've made the last few levels exclusively on spectres in the feerott, usually doing the tree and cave with some friends. Last night I hit 44 and the new spells are extremely powerful, at this moment in time I do actually feel too powerful.<br />
<br />
What other class can:<br />
<br />
Complete heal a tank for 2000+ hps<br />
Buff you +250 hps and some AC<br />
Keeps things stunned through an entire fight<br />
Nuke undead for 585 dam (more than mages!)<br />
Nuke living for 496 dam<br />
Root and atone their way into a dungeon<br />
Give you experience back when you die<br />
<br />
Seriously, clerics are awesome at this level. Yes it's been a very long road, and tough going at some times (levels 20-24 and 29-34 especially) but it really is worth it in the end.<br />
<br />
Right now I do feel too powerful, but shh, don't tell Verant.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

One thing I have begun to realize is that druids &quot;mature&quot; earler than clerics.   This means that they reach their peak around 29.  They continue to gain in power after that but not significantly.  <br />
<br />
In my opinion clerics don't start to mature until level 39 when they get complete heal and resuscitate (exp rez).  Clerics continue to grow in power significantly after that and are essential to the success of high level groups.  Druids, on the other hand, remain a jack of all trades and a master of none.  They can be useful to groups, but at high levels druids have no unique ability that cannot be done better by some other class.<br />

Clerics rock!</div></div><hr />

Clerics have always been a long haul character and it pays off. <br />

If druids are indeed jealous of that (which I doubt because few druids like playing healer)... good  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />

At 49 we get god status because we can restore so much lost exp. Another thing to point out here is that the all might Verant has never really tweaked/nerfed the cleric class.<br />
<br />
Are cleric to powerful - No! every class out there has power - people don't know how to play the game / their char / or the will to crush there enemys.<br />
<br />
So you get a bunch wussy wiped winers &quot;my class sucks nerf the necros&quot; blah blah blah. <br />
<br />
Any way - no one said this game was going to be fair - well maybe Verant did but we know how Verant lies... The way I see it Might makes right. So next time someone starts wining about their class tell them to shut their pie hole or you will smack them around like a redheaded step child.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tailchaser</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the initial post could actually be looked at as 2 different questions.<br />
<br />
Question 1  :  Are Clerics the most powerful healers in the game by such a huge margin that the other healing classes seem weak?  Oh , heck yeah!  That's the point!  =&gt;  That's what we get in exchange for inefficient nukes, difficult/low soloing capability, no DoT or HealoT, and no &quot;flash&quot; abilities.<br />
<br />
Question 2  :  Are Clerics too powerful?  Not even close.  We do one thing extraordinarily well - but just one.  We pay for our healing capabilities with every other aspect of the character.<br />
<br />
Depends on your perspective, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarBringer!</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Erondil should be shot for making this post.<br />
<br />
Clerics are perfectly balanced.<br />
<br />
Clerics are fine as they are, NO NERFS NEEDED.<br />
<br />
Erondil, how could you .. I thought you loved Clerics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabbus</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clerics definitely are not too powerful.  If anything, Druids get every single dang spell in the game as it is (this is not a complaint against druids). But its the truth.<br />
<br />
There are also a ton of druids playing in the game, which is probably why they think clerics are wanted more. <br />
<br />
There really shouldn't even be an argument over this, as there are other classes too, its not just druids and clerics.  There are 6 people to a team.<br />
<br />
But it truely offends me of the person saying we are too powerfull... If we were too powerful then we would be the melee kings, or would be able to solo red's like I have seen many druids do, due to their kiting and DOT spells.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that person wishes we didn't have heals?  Next time he dies I'm sure he would change his mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I know is this- the more I spend time in the planes, the more I realize that clerics and enchanters are *SO* darn necessary. When you are tooling around in the Burning Woods or Lower Guk, you can take your pick, but you simply will NOT do these places with out them.<br />
<br />
Last night's hate break was a fine example. We break in, first few groups get aggro and instakilled. Clerics couldnt camp out.<br />
<br />
My group ports up and I start ressing. One of the poor folks I ressed who was a very fine person, but for some odd reason, was not paying attention, got to close to a wall and *presto* train again. I camp out.<br />
<br />
I log in, there are TWO people in the plane of Hate, me and the rogue who hid. I start ressing, start with the chanters. Both of them are low on mana, we get a rat and an abhorrent, the lom chanters mez both mobs, they take turns medding while the other mezzes, just the 4 of us up there, and I'm medding for mana. I'm constantly camping, interrupting my self at 5 sec. The chanters cant med fast enough due to resists on mez.<br />
<br />
I get some tanks ressed, they grab weapons only and I heal them, they fight one of the mobs. We win!<br />
<br />
I get more people ressed, another train from someone getting too close to a wall. I camp out. Repeat the above 2 more times and you get the idea.<br />
<br />
Once we got started tho, the loots were- rogue gloves, rogue legs, paladin shield, cleric gloves x2, cleric bracer, cleric boots, mage boots, mage arms, chanter arms, and lots of cash loots.<br />
<br />
All in all, a very fine raid loot-wise, we had a TON of fun, and I was honored to have been a part of it, because the teamwork of the chanters was flawless and the rogue did such a fine job. <br />
<br />
Oh, and there were no druids.<br />
<br />
So does that mean that clerics (and chanters too!) are too powerful? No. It means that each group has certain times when they will shine.<br />
<br />
If I'm running around Burning Woods or Skyfire, a Druid is a fine addition to a group.<br />
<br />
In SolB, Druid Charm can take a load off the chanter when it comes to the bats.<br />
<br />
To sum up my post- blanket statements such as &quot;Druids are worthless&quot; or &quot;Clerics are too powerful&quot; are not particularly meaningful. There is a sense of context that is required to determine what makes an effective group or a class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When doing experience returning Resuscitates, I try to remember all the pure hell I went through earlier in life.  I found it extremelly difficult to get through 18 through 23 due to Druids and Shamans 19 and up having the same healing abilities and that great escape ability called Spirit of the Wolf.  I found it equally bad from 28 to 33 when everyone wanted the SOW and figured they could get a Revive from a Cleric without grouping with them.  The Revive is less likely to be needed with SOW (assuming the Druid or Shaman deigned to grace the group with it that is).  At 34, things improved dramatically.  At 39, I was too inexperienced with Complete Healing to use it effectivelly.  I am now 40, and desired for groups.  I now chose the group based on how good a tank I can get.  Give me a 45 and up tank, and we can do non stop pulls.  The experience is awesome even without Clarity.<br />
<br />
I have come very very close to giving up being a Cleric too often to feel anything other than pride in my class.  I am almost purely defensive in groups.  I know other Clerics have different styles, but that is mine.  Are Clerics too powerful?  I have seen too many people uber twink a Cleric, only to give them up in the teens (when things are still okay as far as I am concerned).  I went through my young time untwinked and unable to carry heavy bronze and fine steel since I died fast enough without adding being encoumbered into the issue.  I have pulled things through the walls, ceiling and floors onto me with my healing someone, that type of stuff destroys other people wanting to be a Cleric.<br />
<br />
Even now, when people say that Clerics are soo powerful, I may still have trouble fiinding a group if they already have a Cleric.  If there are too many Clerics in the zone, I will only wait ten minutes looking before I will move on (unless I stick around to clean up all the corpses at the zone that will accept my 50% res).<br />
<br />
Too powerful?  Why take anything away from Clerics?  Too many Clerics will just leave some sitting on their hands or playing an alternate character.  Too few will hurt everyone else.<br />
<br />
Healing may define us as a class, but Complete Healing is what sets us apart, not Resurrection, many stuns, plate or undead direct damage.  If ANY other class receives Complete Healing or Complete Healing is nerfed, I will go play an alternate until things are either fixed, or until I am enjoying playing my alternate more than my Cleric.  I trust that other Clerics will react similarly.<br />
<br />
I paid in lakes of my own blood to be the best healer around.  Take that from me in any form, and I will take everything else I contribute from everyone else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cathawk</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yah... I'm going to have to agree that Clerics are much more powerful and requested once they're in the level 40's and up.<br />
<br />
Yes, other classes, in one way or another, can bring the dead back to life... but honestly, what happens more? Death or Damage. Damage happens more and often, and when not treated properly, results in death.<br />
<br />
No class can match a cleric in healing power. Our guild Druid (level 50) threw a heal on our guild Ranger (level 51) and that life bar barely moved... maybe half a bubble if even that. I threw one of my heals and it was just so much more noticeable.<br />
<br />
Does it mean druids are worthless at the upper levels. I think not. In fact I argue it. I usually just travel with our guild druid. He snares, I fear and then we nuke. It is very effective.<br />

Clerics have ALWAYS been left alone .. As Clerics, we should be happy.  No other class has ever smiled after a proctology exam by Verant.  The Cleric class wouldn't be an exception, either.</div></div><hr />

I am level 43 and have been consistingly grouping with a druid from level 24 or so.  I love having them in my party. I think of all the healers the cleric and druid work very well together.  They serve as excellent secondary healers, evacer, nuker, snarer and sower.  While it is true they can no way heal as well as we can there ability to do all these things makes them incredible useful to a group.  I personally do not see clerics and druids in competition but as partners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">By-Tor</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The initial example given was in a plane run.  Clerics are a necessity on plane/dragon runs, but other than that we can be replaced.  Here is how I feel the cleric class demand is.<br />
<br />
Planes/dragon groups: Cleric is a must in every group.  Enchanter, Warrior and puller (monk or SK) are also a must.<br />
<br />
Normal groups:  Shaman, druid or paladin can help heal; if the pulls are light no cleric is needed.  If a shaman/enchanter is there hardly anyone will take damage.<br />
<br />
Solo: Near impossible.  After high 40s its tough for a cleric to solo.  Clerics can only try and solo single undeads and have very long down times.  Almost every other class can solo better than a cleric.<br />
<br />
In closing, enchanters and necros are by far the most powerful classes all around.  Clerics need others in order to become &quot;powerful&quot;.  Without the warriors clerics pretty much have no extreme healing powers.  Bless them big lugs!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zifnab</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SOLOING:  Clerics can solo just fine.  I'm 49th and have no problems soloing live or dead.  It's just SO damn boring.<br />
<br />
GROUPS: Places like Kanor's, CoM, Planes, Etc we are a requirement.  I'm am CONSTANTLY asked to be raids/group especially in the last levels or so.<br />
<br />
ENCHANTERS:  Even low level chanters are INVALUBLE.  I was in Kanors with a group all 49+ except for the 39th lvl chanter.  We had a couple tough fights but as long as I kept her alive all was well.  The one time she died (985 hps buffed, it's just a matter of time) was the one time we zoned.  She was doing such a good job.  In this case tho she was dead in the time it took to land a SH on a tank.  <br />
<br />
The best thing about being a Cleric...We are the most loved class in Norrath.  Meddik's sig says it all.<br />

After a day to cool off a bit, I think I'm a little more rational, and can appreciate that some druids are always going to see our resses and complete heals as too powerful -- and their sows, dots, dd, ds, ports, and evacs as not being enough (not all druids of course -- I was listening to several very whiny druids)  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
And I guess I can appreciate that we will always be needed on plane raids.  Now just have to get to Hate, instead of Fear!   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Oh, in case anyone was curious, I LOVE my cleric.  Just get tired of all the idiots who assume I'm playing just to help them recover experience -- sure, I have nothing better to do than run through 3 zones to res you for 10 pp.  I'll get right on that... LOL<br />

<br />
To this day, I feel that druids and clerics complement each other quite well, especially when the druid play secondary healer.. with two clerics in the group, the druid usually heals only in an emergency (or throws a heal on the tank while complete heal is being cast to keep the tank alive   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif )<br />
<br />
No, clerics are not too powerful.. in fact, we had to do the hard grinds to the later levels, but will be worth it in the long run. <br />
<br />
We are still below 44 (just), and our best live dd is still our lvl 29 wrath.. but world should open up after 44 we hope   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif so until then, defensive spells are our major assets and they work just fine in a group   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
As for rezzes, hehe, if time and group permits, am always available for rezzes, albeit lvl 39 rezz.<br />

<br />
Enchanters definitely come as the first and most powerful addition though...and in that case having a cleric to back him up tends to be the backbone of a strong group, since enchanters have slow as well.</div></div><hr />

Thanks guys for restoring my faith in my class.  I love playing the cleric, I just hate to see all the 'cool' spells druids get that I don't (sigh).  Well now I have something to look forward to.<br />

We be wunnerful in groups jus' as 'nchanters be.  But like 'nchanters, we be some 'f th' worst solo.<br />
<br />
Like 'nchanters, we kin be 'ffective even when we be a lot lower level'n th' group we be workin' with.  Yestiday I bin grouped 'gain with two 51st level magicians an' a 40th level 'nchanter.  Th' magicians an' their pets bin doin' all th' damage, but th' 'nchanter an' me bin th' ones keepin' ever'body alive.<br />
<br />
Heh.  An' I'd be likin' t' see a druid keep up with th' healin' on one 'f those big earth pets.  Some 'f th' stuff that bin beatin' on 'em bin doin' 140 damage per hit.<br />
<br />
But th' druids be able t' do lots that we kinnae.  Druids be th' master 'f travel with their tel'ports, Spirit 'f t' Wolf, an' Camouflage.  They be able t' git places faster'n safer'n anybody else.<br />
<br />
They also be havin' other spells that be wunnerful fer groups like Snare an' th' damage shields.<br />
<br />
In me 'pinion, th' reason they be hampered be b'cause there be too many 'f 'em.  Sometimes I be walkin' int' th' Dreadlands at less populated times an' one third th' people be Wanderers.  There jus' dinnae be 'nough d'mand t' be keepin' up with those numbers.<br />
<br />
If'n anybody be thinkin' clerics be too powerful, they be welcome t' be startin' out as a young cleric jus' like I bin an' workin' there way up t' where I be.  An' when they be c'mplainin' 'roun' 20th level that it be too hard, I be happy t' be r'mindin' 'em that I bin goin' through those levels with bronze armor.<br />
<br />
Too powerful?  I jus' bin gittin' Retribution an' be wunnerin' if'n I be able t' solo a Hill Giant now.  Mos' druid bin doin' that since they bin 10 levels lower'n me.<br />

<br />
Listen to my level 49 druid friend tell me about kiting four mobs at once in the Dreadlands, and then tell me again about how we're the one who's too powerful?<br />
<br />
Druids have it all...utility, burn, healing, the works. Clerics have our one or two great things, and they envy us our niche.<br />

Lvl 49 Starfire 612DD 250 mana (2.48hp/mana)<br />
Lvl 59 Wildfire 1024 320 mana (3.2hp/mana)(casting time 6.5+3= 9.5)/damage= 107.8 per second<br />
<br />
vs our<br />
<br />
Lvl 44 Retribution 519DD 240 mana (2.16hp/mana)<br />
Lvl 54 Reckoning 670DD 250 mana (2.68hp/mana)(casting time 7+6= 13)/damage=51.5 per second<br />
Lvl 55 Exile Undead 725DD 250 mana (2.89hp/mana)(casting time 5+2.5= 7.5)/damage=96.6 per second<br />
<br />
In summary the druid's best nuke does OVER TWICE the damage/time than the cleric's.  The druid in the initial post is just another whiner.</div></div><hr />

Here's an Idea let's make everybody the same, and give them the same abilities, and the exact same weapons. Oh wait, there are games already like that. <br />
<br />
They're called Quake and Unreal. <br />
