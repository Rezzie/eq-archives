<br />
Obviously they have a couple extra mobs that are highly MR, but supposidely they fixed most of the rest of the mobs.<br />
<br />
Is pulling still ok here?  Is it tough to get solo mobs?  How is the MR on them?<br />

Versus undead snakes, I was getting close to 80% of my exile undeads landing for full.  I'm told you can avoid them all togeather if you camp in the right spots.    However my group was pulling everything we can find for exp.   The pop time is definitely longer, so it can't handle the 70+ people it was before.</div></div><hr />
