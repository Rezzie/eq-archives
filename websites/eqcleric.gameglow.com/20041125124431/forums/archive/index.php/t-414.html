Is this a high enough level to go to these zones?  Would they be able to find a group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably so, but you may be limited if there are a large number of other healers in the zone.<br />
<br />
The Bedroom Loop area would be good for you in LGuk, great Xp. I would suggest basing your camp in the spider room however so as to avoid trains.<br />
<br />
At 38, I was almost in the Frenzy room in Lguk as the only healer. It just so happens that a 41 cleric logged in as they were coming to get me, and I understand why they would rather use complete heal, since most people in that camp were 45-50.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, at 35 you can get into groups there with people higher level than you. At 39, you can get into groups WAY higher than you.<br />

<br />
At 35th level I bin makin' me first visit t' th' Assassin / S'pplier Room.  At 36th I bin makin' me first visit t' th' mage room.  That bin kind 'f crazy b'cause ever'body else in me group bin 10 t' 15 levels higher'n me.  Even all th' pets bin red fer starters.<br />
<br />
As Meddik bin sayin', a group in th' Spider Room'll be gittin' ye th' best 'xperience.  That'll be pullin' mostly live stuff.<br />
<br />
Also, there be higher'n normal d'mand fer clerics b'cause there be so many undead.  I bin in a group 'f five with two other clerics b'fore.  Th' highest level one bin th' group blaster.  Th' other two 'f us bin healin' an' stunnin'.<br />
<br />
Course there bin a lot 'f times when I bin stickin' me head in there an' nobody bin wantin' a clerics.  There be a few other places ye kin be goin' in nearby zones if'n that be th' case.  Me choices usually bin Cazic Thule, Rathe Mountains, an' th' Oasis.<br />
