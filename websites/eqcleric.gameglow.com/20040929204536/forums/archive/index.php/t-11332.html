<br />
The southern side of Echo Caverns (this is the side with the entrance to The Deep) has three distinct camps that are excellent grinding spots. All three of them feature underbulks, fungus fiends, and stonegrabbers, all level 34-37 or thereabouts.<br />
<br />
Camp 1, the camp closest to the Shadowhaven zone, is a bit slow, but the mobs here can be easily single-pulled. There are four of them along the wall, spaced nicely apart so you know that's what the area designer had in mind.<br />
<br />
If you go west from Camp 1, you'll get to a fork. Taking the north path leads you to Camp 2. These are also easily single-pulled. I don't usually camp here because someone is usually here camping the Taskmaster and keeps the room partially clear.<br />
<br />
The best camp in my opinion is Camp 3. You get here by taking the other fork west from Camp 1. Here, there are 9 distinct spawns: 3 fiends, 4 underbulks, and 2 random (cycles between underbulk, stonegrabber, and fiend). However, you will need some way of splitting the mobs (Lull, feign death, root, mez) as you may get an additional mob to add due to proximity.<br />
<br />
Occasionally you'll see a unique fiend named Trillioc spawn. He's level 39, but other than that there's nothing special about him. We haven't gotten him to drop anything yet.<br />
<br />
The greatest thing about this part of Echo is that it's usually not crowded, and there are no wanderers which will add on you.<br />
<br />
I duoed here with a mage, pulling mobs and keeping her fire pet healed and buffed while she nuked. I imagine that many other classes would work well as a duo partner; in fact I can't really think of any class that you really wouldn't want to duo with here, except perhaps another cleric, since the mobs are not undead and the two of you would be hard pressed to stay healed.<br />
<br />
If you're on the Povar server please don't steal my camp! :D It's reserved until it goes mostly light blue to me (probably not until I hit 49). ;) I would say that I probably earned about 75% of a yellow per hour, which I consider to be very brisk experience when you consider that neither I (level 47) nor my partner (level 42) are twinked. If you could find all three camps open this would be a monster place for you to be powerlevelled by a 55+ person.<br />
