<br />
I mean its fun, I mean really fun from a healers perspective its the most fun I've had in a long time.  I like to be busy!!!<br />
<br />
But my guild is starting to get bummed with all the coffining especially when only a few people are getting exp and there realy isn't a huge loot/hour ratio for the zone compared to most other stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for hints/help whatever.  We figured out emp on our own and will clear VT soon as well on our own ideas.  But I am curious what some of the other clerics think.<br />

Don't remember when we last wiped there really... or ok I do, when porting up after Temariel to Va Xi AHR there were 3 Eom Centiens and a Pli Senshali waiting... was bit too brutal. Other than that there's nothing truly challenging.<br />
