<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinlaen</div><div class="date">12-09-1999, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, verant discovers that there is a yet another game imbalance.  The guise of the deceiver.  So what do they do to fix it?  They change it to rogue/bard only.  That is fine (although it could be argued that even bards shouldn't be allowed to get it), but if this ISN'T fair to dark elves, why allow the people who still have it now to keep theirs?  But even before they made this change I have always thought that this mask was unbalanced for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  There was little to no reason to play a dark elf (or any dark race).  Sure we get infravision and we have access to whole 3 cities (grobb, which is near lower guk which is nice) but other than that we have nothing.  If they have a mask for good races, why not make one for dark races?<br />
<br />
2.  The entire mask idea is unbalanced.  Enchanters should be the ONLY class that could change into a different form.  If you picked a dwarf cleric you should be stuck with it.  With the mask you can be both a good race and a dark race.  Not fair.<br />
<br />
My point is that verant obviously hates dark races.  As you know we have very very few quests (plus the temple quests..  bleh) and there is nothing we can do that other races can not.  The same could not be said of the good races.<br />
<br />
However I am not the least bit sorry that I picked a dark elf.  I do wish verant had a little more consideration for dark elves and made them a &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;little&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; bit balanced but I doubt they will do anything.<br />
<br />
Oh, and while I'm here I'd also like to thank verant on removing the jboots, rubicite armor, and the mana stone just before I could get each of them.  Thanks verant!<br />

If I recall when you make your &quot;dark&quot; race charecter it tells you the race/class combination is of &quot;higher&quot; difficulty. In a world that is majority &quot;good&quot; what more could you expect?<br />

 Would you made the game so evil people could enter good cities ?<br />
 For quests, well... I suppose they could have made them more suited than they are.<br />
 To be honest, I think I only have done one quest in this entire game, and that is the Kilij blade. (!)<br />

I play the game and if Verant changes soemthing I don't like...oh well. I suppose there is something else out there that I'll go after instead. Also to those who don't know there are MANY other items that you can wear so that you can see at night and still play your good aligned race. My human cleric has a glowing stone band which provides her with infravision and there are TONS of enchanters who have those sight spells as well. Find a friend.... <br />
<br />
If you haven't noticed...Verant does what Verant wants. There is nothing that can be said or done about it save canceling your account. Verant has the market, there are no other games like this one. As my pal Kutch said...deal with it. Verant has already shown us that they don't care what the customers think. <br />
<br />
So now having said this...here is what all you unhappy people can do. <br />
<br />
1. Get over it.<br />
2. Cancel your account and wait for a new ORPG<br />

The shamans also get kickarse armor and weapons which make them even cooler as well. I think Troll shaman would be definitely better than a barbarian or ogre one for just that double regeneration effect.<br />
<br />
Besides druids don't get that regen effect for quite a while and bards need their healing song to regen all those HPs they lost getting their arses whooped by most MOBS.    http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

The issue I have with the guise is that anyone could go and spend a few hours camping for the guise, getting nice exp at the same time, and get a broken item that gives them for free what many people pay a hefty exp and faction penalty for thier characters entire life to get. It never really bothered me that much, I like the factions I get, gives me a much more diverse variaty of things to kill. Objectivly though, I see it as unfair. Kinda like an item that makes your base STR and STA the same as an Ogres base would be more than a little bit unfair to Ogres, or an item that gave regeneration but didn't stack with racial regeneration would be a bit unfair to trolls who have paid the price for it from day one.<br />

Since I need night vision to get solo experience outside, this is a problem when you run into something 10 levels above you that you didn't see in the dark.  That the mask gives the illusion of being a dark elf IS NOT unbalancing.  That it gives the illusion of being a dark elf IS unfair.  Giving Ultravision IS unbalancing, and doesn't really make sense to me.  Is this an illusion?  Or a shape shift?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riga Mortus</div><div class="date">12-27-1999, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is all the talk about fair and unfair?<br />
<br />
Who cares that there is a Guise for good races to appear evil, yet there is not for evil races to appear good?<br />
<br />
Why is that unfair?  That is such a stupid thing to say.<br />
<br />
Here is a solution for you, why not play a game where everyone can be the same?  Where everyone can have the same abilities, the same armor, the same weapons, the same spells?  In other words, have you tried out Ultima Online?  It might be more to your liking.<br />
<br />
The purpose of magic items is to add the the enhancement of those using it, not to belittle the people who have no use for it.  Not to mention now that the Guise has been removed and now I can no longer get it (which I am not really to upset about.  I got my JBoots but missed the boat on Ruby and Manastone).<br />
<br />
I think that Verant will eventually put similiar items like this back in the game.  When they removed Ruby and put in the Class-specific armor, I was REALLY hoping that each BP would have it's own Ruby Aura effect.  This would have made a lot of people happy (me included, stupid Cleric armor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClericalBinge</div><div class="date">12-27-1999, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, one thing you must remember, You are KOS places initially because of one thing...Your religon.  I am a dwarf of Brell, and with the mask on, i am still KOS to DE, i am threating to Trolls, yet they will still attack me if i get to close.  Yet i can still walkaround faydark and such and not be KOS as a DE.  Although merchants seem to KOS.  <br />
     I think I saw a post a while ago that stated how someone reflects towards you.  I think they factor in Level, Race, religon and whatever +'s and -'s you have received towards that particular race.  <br />
     So for example, I have never done anything to Trolls, hence I am only &quot;Threating&quot;, but because I am a follower of Brell Serilis, I am KOS.  <br />
     I have had the mask for ages.  I don't even use it much anymore.  Primarily when walking through darker zones.  <br />
     I do agree they should give more race masks tho.  I suppose gnome would be funny as well.  <br />
     But by all means the mask does not grant you automatic immunity into an evil town.  Unless you are agnostic, then you have a chance, considering you havent killed their guards or done some negative quests.<br />

(Beep ..... beep ..... beep beep beepbeep-follower of Tunare! KILL!!!)  Does everyone wear big giant holy symbols tatooed/branded on their foreheads?  Not that I really care, mind you ... so what if I'm KOS to the ogre bouncers in Feerrott while I have the guise activated.  Not like I really want to traipse through Oggok anyway, I'm a high elf and that place is just ugly and abhorrent to my refined elven senses.  I'm just curious how they know.<br />

<br />
Go back to kindergarten if you want to act like some name calling brat.  We are here to talk about things as adults in an adult manner.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Here is a solution for you, why not play a game where everyone can be the same? Where everyone can have the same abilities, the same armor, the same weapons, the same spells? In other words, have you tried out Ultima Online? It might be more to your liking.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have played Ultima Online.  Everyone doesn't have the same abilities because some people had more up to date cheat programs than other people.<br />
<br />
The reason it is unfair is because Dark Elves ought to be able to recognize other dark elves by sight.  Even Anonymous Enchanters tend to have a pet around, so that tends to give them away.<br />
<br />
&quot;The purpose of magic items is to add the the enhancement of those using it, not to belittle the people who have no use for it. Not to mention now that the Guise has been removed and now I can no longer get it (which I am not really to upset about. I got my JBoots but missed the boat on Ruby and Manastone).&quot;<br />
<br />
I would like to have the item.  I just don't think it should have been made to exist in the first place.  You seem to equate my saying &quot;Not fair to dark elves.&quot; with my saying something like &quot;Useless to me&quot;.  I do not play a Dark Elf.  I play a Human who is blind at night.  Any item that would give me night sight, even infravision, would be very valuable to me.  Dark Elves paid for the priveledge though.  I didn't.<br />
<br />
You seem upset that the items have been removed from the game and are trying to belittle me for agreeing that they should have been removed.  Personally, I think the ones that have already dropped should be broken.  These are my feelings about the situation.  <br />
<br />
Childish comments by you are not required or desired if you disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaxus</div><div class="date">12-28-1999, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not so sure you get much, if not any, dark elf faction from the mask that would allow you to go into their city.  I am still KoS even with the mask.  But that is probably becuase of my religion and race.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, the mask does not allow you to see invisible.  Yes, it allows some races to have infravision but they also suffer the negative faction hit.  But as a high elf, this mask is nothing more than a novelty item for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">12-29-1999, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it is Ultravision that it gives.  The idea is not to use it in cities for faction, but to use it in dungeons and at night for seeing.  That is powerful enough.  I can understand an item like that and shrug it off.<br />
<br />
What I don't like is it making someone look like a dark elf that isn't an enchanter.  When I have played a dark elf, I found there was a racial solidarity that you don't see in the lighter races.  This item hurts that solidarity.  Some of the best people I have met are dark elves, ogres and trolls.  There are some spectacularly evil ones it is true though.  The dark elves have enough trouble with people role playing ruining their evenings without taking it in the chops from another dark elf (&quot;I can't cure thy disease, thou art evil.&quot; &quot;Umm, and this makes you good?&quot;).  Leave the night vision and let it drop or not.  The Illusion Dark Elf should be broken though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drzero</div><div class="date">12-30-1999, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't imagine playing another rance besides a Dark Elf. Why? Because IMHO Dark Elf players tend to be better and more respectful players.<br />
<br />
I recently went to crushbone with my enchanter. While there, a high elf wizard dies at the hards of an orc orcale near me. He immediately berated and swore at me for not helping. Um excuse me? One, I am not the orc's enemies, two I hadn't even con'ed him, since the orc was down to a bubble of health. But of course he continues to berate me despite me protestations. Couple that with all the insipid and childish shouting going on in Greater Faydark, and I am SO glad to be a Dark Elf. I gated back to Nektulous. Nice quiet Nektulous where people are polite and actually know how to play.<br />
<br />
Yes, the way of Innoruuk is hard. Most people don't like you. When I was playing my wood elf ranger, I didn;t like dark elves either, but to be honest, the Dark Elf players I ran across were generally nicer than the losers on Faydwer.<br />
<br />
In my experience, most people quit playing a Dark Elf when they can't find their way out of Neriak. I know two of my friends did. But I insisted they try again, and helped them get going. Now, I think they will never turn back either.<br />
<br />
You won't see another race that is more consistently well educated about the game, nice, helpful, respectful, and foster a sense of community. Yes, there are bad apples in the bunch. But at least the good ones far outweigh the bad ones.<br />
<br />
Also, I feel that as a dark elf I have a lot more of the world - well - the GOOD parts of the world open to me. Going to Cazic is a simple trip. South Ro is virtually deserted and there's a DE camp to boot. Neriak has EVERYTHING you could ever want (except a fletching kit .grumble.) And the temple of Ro is right next door. Freeport is a piece of cake, and I don't fear killing NPCs. HH takes a little work to be able to pass thru, tis true. Faydwer is too crowded and so is Qeynos. You can have them. All the good stuff is in between!<br />

<br />
Whats a &quot;respectful&quot;, &quot;well educated&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; DE like you doing fighting in Crushbone to begin with!?!?<br />
<br />
That dragoon faction hit wouldn't go over very well in your precious Neriak.<br />
<br />
Could this be why the high elf died that day?<br />
<br />
*chuckles*<br />
<br />
Your post about how DE controlers are the best in-game is a crock. I have charecters of every race and find that all races have the 'good' and the 'bad, the problem with GF is just over-crowding. No race has shown &quot;more educated&quot; players. I will say that trolls and ogres RP the most though at low level. <br />
<br />
Whining about your race selection is useless you took the option and were warned. Dark elves do have some advantages, I agree with Drzero totally in the hunting ground options and bindabiltity to some of the best dungeons(and no threat of Bouncere Hurd!).<br />
<br />
As for the Mask, if you take the exp hits associated with DE vision, I can't see a problem with it. With a Mask, everyone I know is still KoS in Nerriak. So whats the advantage?<br />
<br />
Yours, <br />
E<br />
<br />
PS as for nice DEs in Nek forrest if I could count the times I have been trained if I got attacked by the guards by DEs who think they are RPing when they are really harrassing the hell out of me. In fact I was at a event on Fennin in which a couple guilds were attempting to breach Nerriak, what stopped them was DE training guards to the zone.<br />
*sigh*<br />
So, no race really has the one-up on others for niceness or respectability.<br />
Parting advice:<br />
If you must judge, do so on how people play and not by what race they are.</div></div><hr />

Even if that DE had not been training guards (and while I agree this is &quot;harrassing&quot; it could also be considered &quot;roleplaying&quot;, after all, he was just &quot;spreading the alarm&quot; about the invasion) I think this would be hard as all hells. At least if you wanted to go any distance. I shudder to think of the number of people that would be needed just to take the 7 to 10 level 45 to 50+ guards at the entrance. Ahh, well, at least on RZ I we darkevles would have had a chance to find some people of high enough level to join the guards in combating you  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

They could have used more lvl50 charecters, but were doing fine until the first CR with the training put everyone on edge. They were pulling from as far away as the foreign quarter before the first CR, you can check the pics on Dwarven Delving I believe.<br />

<br />
I didn't say I was *fighting* in Crushbone, I was just visiting! :P<br />
<br />
Ok, ok. Maybe I am biased. And I'm sure everyone has their own opinions about races, and players. Sorry for sounding snobby. It's just my opinion and experience that the DE players are better and nicer - not because they're DE's, but because DE's are harder to play and thus players are more experienced. I'm sure a lot of it has to do with overcrowding in GFay. - Ugh. I hate that zone now.<br />
<br />
But, every race has excellent players, and I have encountered them as well.<br />
<br />
As far as training the guards to the light races - that is abhorrant to me, and I'm sorry it happened to you. I would never do that. If I see a light race attacking a guard I may stand and cheer on the DE guard, but I won't interefere.<br />
