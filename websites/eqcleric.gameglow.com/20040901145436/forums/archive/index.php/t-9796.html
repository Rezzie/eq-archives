<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyfist</div><div class="date">02-23-2000, 01:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paineel opens, all sorts of goodies for evil clerics, but not a damn thing for the followers of Innoruuk.  KOS faction and no quest items that can be used, what better way for Verant to show a big glowy middle finger to those who go to the trouble of being Tier'Dal priests?  They don't get a single quest of their own, so why should they get to have anyone else's quests?  Quest after quest, all for good clerics, all KOS to dark elves, and when they finally do something for evil clerics, they go and leave the DE out.  That's past inconsiderate, it's just mean.  If we had any quests to do in Neriak it would be different, but we don't.  Not a single one, not a single quest, not even a minor little item that's unique to them.  Verant can't seem to comprehend that there is more to evil than being KOS to everyone, bad guys have allies too.  But you can't even walk into another evil town without getting slaughtered.  Trolls hate ogres, ogres hate trolls, the third gate of Neriak hates everyone who isn't a dark elf, and apparently Paineel hates everyone who isn't an evil human.  It's just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

The helm.. It's not that great and only grants the blind ERU and HUM clerics dead eye. Whoopty doo. <br />
 <br />
