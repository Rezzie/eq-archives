<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rosieana</div><div class="date">12-15-2001, 12:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question about killing spectres.  Me a level 41 cleric with my level 42 magician friends wants to level off of these things for exp.  I know that there are spectres in feerrot, oasis, and ocean of tears.  Now my question is how do you single pull them?  Are there any good spots to set up camp?  My cleric friend told me that she tried to pull the specs in oasis at level 45, but she ended up pulling the whole island instead :-(  Basically what I would like to find out about is detailed strategy on how I can pull this off myself, and I especially need the info on specs in OOT. Also I would like to know what spawn timer they are on?  Thanks in advance to all who replies.<br />

I successfully soloed spectres at around level 39 all the way up to level 44 (although at 39 there was *lots* of down time and running to the zone if I got a particularly nasty one). Also, until level 42 or 43 I seldom used Root/Enstill. Expel Undead casts amazingly fast. Also, you run faster than spectres. So, what I did (hopefully the latter). <br />
<br />
You *really* need a lot of mana to do this at level 39. My wisdom was something like 182 at the time which gave me enough mana to do this. <br />
<br />
Of course, at level 44, Spectres are cake. I still use the same technique, however, although I use Entill in there; often it will last until the spectre is dead. <br />
<br />
I see a lot of people suggesting using spook. This might be a good idea after the initial Stun/Blast. Stun, then Blast, then Spook. Then start over. I just never found a need to do that. <br />

You can do this withalmost zero downtime with KEI if you med out of their spell range.</div></div><hr />
