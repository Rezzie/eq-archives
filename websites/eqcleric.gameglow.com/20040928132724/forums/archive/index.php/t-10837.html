The way we were told to go in was cleric have a group of all tanks, then everyone else group up, we rused in 2 waves the tank/Cleric (clerics were told to stand UNDER trak)first then the casters after us, well by the time the casters got their all they saw were corpses &amp; an angry dragon sitting on them. So what are good tactics to use against the big guy?<br />
<br />
we had about 44 people ranging from 52-60</div></div><hr />
