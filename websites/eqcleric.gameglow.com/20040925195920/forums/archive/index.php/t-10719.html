<br />
On our server, Fear and Hate are shared among two powerful guild consortia who generally do not admit outsiders on raids.<br />
<br />
So we decided to go up and poke around in Air. No problems on the Keymaster island.<br />
<br />
Three azzoracks killed 30 people in about 2 minutes, and I spent 1500pp out of my personal bank account for coffins on the corpse recovery.<br />
<br />
Any tips or tactics would be greatly appreciated, I cannot afford to do such a thing too many more times *grins*<br />

The spot chosen to fight is near the teleporter, I am told, but I don't know exactly where. The scout should be able to figut it out though.<br />
<br />
When the scout thinks it is time, everyone ports up there, while invis, and then wait until an azerack aggros. NO pets until an azerack gets there. Kill the bird as fast as you can, make sure to have demob groups for  extra birds (tank heavy groups that takes care of secondary/tertiary targets).<br />
<br />
If you're lucky, you will get a few birds dead before geting wiped out and starting over from keymaster island. if you're unlucky you won't. If you're DAMN lucky you get a few, without having more aggros and have time to invis and med up for a second fight. :-)<br />
<br />
Note: This is NOT something I have done myself, but it's what I've heard from what i consider to be fairly trustworthy sources.<br />

From what I hear, their Sky runs cost them a LOT of platinum.</div></div><hr />
