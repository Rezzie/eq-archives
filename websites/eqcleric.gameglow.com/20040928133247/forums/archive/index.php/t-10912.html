<br />
I'm in a decent sized guild with a few 60s/epics etc. but that hasn't really broken into Velious yet short of killing Wuoshi/some WWL dragons, and farming PoG + TOV west wing occasionally (we're on giant faction atm). We attempted the Dain a while ago and got him to about 30% (before we had figured out a main tank CHeal strategy). We can easily kill most Kunark mobs (all the outdoor dragons, Trak, VS, etc...yeah I know they're all old news which is why we are trying to figure out how to go about it now).<br />
<br />
What would you guys suggest as a good uber-mob to try next, or a good progression to work on? We are thinking about attempting the Dain again, our necros are clamoring for us to try Zlandicar, others say we need to get more ToV armor first. Personally I want the halo off CT  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif Is Dain -&gt; Zlandicar -&gt; CT a reasonable/possible progression or am I completely underestimating one or more of them? If so are there any suggestions as to what we should concentrate on for now and what we can make an attempt on in the near future?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

He hits hard and has a lot of hp, but is slowable. You can make tons of mistakes in the fight and correct them on the fly.<br />
<br />
If you do PoG much, you can try fighting a trifling focuser. They don't hit very hard or fast, but they have &gt;1 million HP, so its a very long fight. Goal should be to keep agro on 1 person the entire fight. <br />
You can also practice transfering agro from one tank to the next. Goal is to have it go from hitting one tank to the tank you want to pass agro too without hitting anyone else.<br />
<br />
I recommended this to my guild some months ago, but they ignored me, so we learned agro control on Dozekar the Cursed and Vindicator...<br />
<br />
If you want ST keys and decent loot, you can do Lendiniara the Keeper in ToV west. Its a very easy fight if you have good agro control and work out the healing on the MT. Its a total raid wipeout if you don't have good agro control or can't deal with the 300pt unresistable AE and dispell of top buff. =)<br />
<br />
Different MOBs are different kinds of fights though. There are guilds that destroy Dain, but wipe out on Zlandicar and Velketor, or Destroy Yelinak, but level Dain and CT up repeatedly. My guilds current nemesis is Klandicar2. We are a +CoV guild but pharm Lendiniara the Keeper and Sontalak for ST keys. Klandicar just owns us for some reason though. =/<br />

Though it is hard to compare difficulty of melee mobs vs those where the AE is the issue, thats the general idea, in my opinion.<br />

We did him with like 28 people and 10 or so were 55 ish in level on an off night when alot of our higher players took the day off.  <br />
<br />
Id argue for the Keeper being a joke once you learn the proper tactics as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Velk is the best bet though for starting out in velious in that its a fast spawn that noone really goes after as much and CR is a joke with a good factioned bard or enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">09-18-2001, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Roughly I'd class 'ubermobs' of Velious, starting from easiest and moving up:<br />
<br />
~24man for those that know them (no huge heroics here either)<br />
Cekenar -&gt; Tukaarak the Warder -&gt; Nanzata the Warder -&gt; Hraashna the Warder -&gt; Sevalak -&gt; 350 Dain -&gt; Velketor -&gt; Telkorenar -&gt; Gozzrem -&gt; Zlandicar -&gt; Dagarn the Destroyer -&gt; Koi'doken -&gt; Lord Feshlak -&gt; Lady Mirinella -&gt; Jorlleag -&gt; Ikatiar<br />
<br />
~30man<br />
Statue of RZ -&gt; Dozekar -&gt; Lady Nevederia -&gt; Vindicator -&gt; Lendiniara -&gt; Eashen -&gt; Aaryonar -&gt; Zlexak<br />
<br />
~36man<br />
Vulak -&gt; Sontalak -&gt; CT -&gt; Kreizenn -&gt; Klandicar 2.0 -&gt; 425 Dain<br />
<br />
~42man<br />
(REAL hard for me to compare Tormax and Yelinak.. Tormax seems harder but maybe having ~3DBs at every Yelinak raid compared to an average of 0 GBs at Tormax can do that)<br />
Tormax -&gt; Yelinak -&gt; Lord Vyemm -&gt; Ventani the Warder<br />

Just a sort of estimate. The '24man' category basically means anyone should be able to take them out using ~40 people, and I do mean anyone (ok be 55+ preferably). If you fail it's not because you haven't farmed enough ToV armor, it's because you are doing something horribly and totally wrong.<br />
<br />
So basically of those mobs you talked about reaching I'd say 350Dain -&gt; Velketor -&gt; Zland -&gt; CT<br />
<br />
Of course the issue is competition as well as difficulty. Dain is still spanked fast on RN for his head, even though pretty much everything else is rotting. Velketor is pretty much 0 competition thing. Zlandicar is probably pretty popular as the easiest source of ST keys and CT drops good stuff for those who haven't farmed the hell out of him already (on RN atleast we've grown tired of PoF already so it's not too rare for CT to live for more than 24h).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">09-19-2001, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda different fights... dain you obviously can't main tank.. CT you can, but hard, and Zland you can very easily.<br />
<br />
350 dain is beyond wuss, so is Zland. Velk you can mess up all over the place and still win np. I would say kill those 3 first, then attempt CT once you've got the hang of healing.<br />
<br />
350 dain/Zland/Velk while different fights, I would compare them all closely in difficulty. CT being a step up after that.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Velk is by far the best mob to practice healing, aggro control and tank switching imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">09-19-2001, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you mean by 350/425 dain mob?  Does he hit for different ammounts depending on what he spawns with?<br />
<br />
Oh incidentally - you know how to sort out CT?  We tried a zerg raid with 40 and about 4 clerics the other day but couldn't really work out a strategy that worked, admittly him running finding the nearest building and sitting on top proclaiming himself king didn't help :&gt;<br />
<br />
Just seems difficult to hold agro on him, meaning CH cycles don't work too well, and generally people die before you realise they are getting hit (like most stuff my guild has been fighting nowadays heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">09-19-2001, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, treeing CT is a classic tactic! We did it every time we killed him, basically. :-P<br />
<br />
For an example on treeing, check  www.midnightsojourn.com (http://www.midnightsojourn.com) , there are a few of them there. :-)<br />
<br />
Oh...last time we did Tormax, we had 35 people (five deaths). Yet, we were having troubles with Dagarn the Destroyer with around 40...</div></div><hr />

Your average guild probably needs 2x those numbers to defeat those mobs.  The numbers Delheru gave are what your resident uber guild uses, often more than that.<br />
<br />
Even Fires of Heaven used 70+ people the first time they killed Vyemm/Vulak.  Once they got the strategy down, they used significantly less.  Same is true for my guild.<br />

<br />
One questiuon about the 350 Dain, is there a way to tell he's the 350 one (as in a set spawn time, or what he's holding etc.) or do you just have to let him whack you a few times to find out? If we took a raid force intending to try 350 Dain and it turned out to be 425 should we call it off or give it a try anywy? (I think our first Dain attempt was the 425 one).</div></div><hr />

<br />
New characters start out apprehensive to Coldain and dubious to Dain. Knowing that, the rest of the information should be trivial. Finding out which version of Dain you have will be the least of your worries however...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious where would Innoruk fit in those lists. Is he so easy he doesn't rate? His drops seem pretty sub-par. Is he not worth the effort?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">09-20-2001, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically the category I dumped Vulak in was a diss because of his wussiness. And yeah the numbers are quite low, but atleast on RN situation is very different now than it was when we were killing stuff for the first time. First 425 Dain was a real bitch and I'm not even sure if ToV armor had been upgraded by then. Had like 45 people and had to res rush to a degree. Now even unguilded people have near full warlords for example and there's so many exquisite weapons and willsappers around that it's hard to believe.<br />
<br />
Also I think posting the low numbers used is better for the raid morale. I used to check out how many FoH or whatever used and then aim for that, and if we had like double the numbers there was just NO reason to fail. In effect if I posted the double numbers I bet many people would be quitting after the first failure thinking 'uh they needed 40 people and we have 44 and they have much better gear, maybe it just won't happen', whereas if I post 24 there's very little excuse to give up with 44 =P<br />
<br />
Oh and Innoruuk is so easy he doesn't count.<br />
<br />
Also trying the 425 on your first attempt isn't necessarily wise if you don't have experience with Velious ubers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">09-20-2001, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">425 dain is *quite* a bit harder than 350. Like, don't just think &quot;ah he only hits for 75 more dmg.. np&quot;, the fight is much different since your CH's won't hit at 10 sec intervals anymore.. you need more of a set strat.<br />
<br />
If its your first vel mob.. I'd definetly recommend waiting till you kill 350, but if you have no competition, then by all means...<br />
<br />
Inny's guards are more of an annoyance than inny.. so nah he doesn't count  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Bind a lvl 1 in thurg, and attack dain a few times to test if he's 350/425. As an example, we can kill 350 dain easily with 30 but 425 takes us at least 42 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haldraeger</div><div class="date">11-17-2001, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of Inny, does anyone kill him anymore?  I dont think anyone does on Saryrn.<br />
Time Sink &gt; Loot Reward, so he is never even an option.<br />
<br />
For us, Yelinak is the uber MOB.  Although we haved killed him albiet infrequently, he gets our goat a lot. Any advice be kind. His knockback sometimes causes both the main tank and cleric(s) to be hit, causing the main tank to go out of range (OOR). <br />
<br />
ToV dragons not all that hard. Just main tank em, position close to the corner of a wall so casters can nuke em/hide from AE and clerics can heal tanks and be behind wall.  Not rocket science.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule is a blast to kill imo.  Main tanking is somewhat a challenge and alleviates the usual boredom of ToV because of his knockback and being in a open area.  Dain 425 is difficult but a wild and fun fight.  My analogy is Dain is like Sir Lancelot in Monty Python's Holy Grail going around slaughtering the villagers.</div></div><hr />
