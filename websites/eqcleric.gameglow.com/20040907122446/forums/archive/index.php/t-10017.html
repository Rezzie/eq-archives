<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cobra101</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am getting exasperated.<br />
<br />
How do you explain to secondary healers to leave it to you?<br />
<br />
Lately I have found myself joining groups including Druids and Shaman and within minutes I am gritting my teeth. I mean these guys have offensive spells we can't even dream of, but as soon as tank_01 is half a bub down - long before it is worth sinking a decent heal into him I am getting <br />
&quot;Druid_01&quot; starts to cast a spell&quot;<br />
&quot;Tank_01&quot; feels better&quot;<br />
<br />
because the larger heals are a slower cast I often end up wasting mana - even with a &quot;Heal Incoming&quot; macro!<br />
<br />
I have tried talking to them, I have tried talking to the group leader. All I seem to do is get branded as a grouchy cleric.<br />
<br />
The fact that I am ending fights with virtually full mana while the druid/shaman is calling &quot;OOM&quot; is so annoying. And before someone suggests it - where I am fighting, every offensive spell I have gets resisted or mitigated to nothing. Last night I wrathed a mob for 2 damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it class-envy? or just stupidity?<br />
<br />
I also watched my wife play her 43 Cleric in a group with druid and shaman and they were slowing and dotting while the tanks sat on half health happy to wait for a big heal. So perhaps it is just a phase these guys will get over?<br />
<br />
Anyhow short succinct phrases guaranteed to sort them out would be most welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherazade</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate that too - makes me feel as if I were a unreliable cleric - sometimes I even find druids telling me how to heal &quot;why did you cast  celestial elexir on me - I wasn't almost hurt&quot; - getting tired to tell them that the mob was beating on them - and I am not such a great prophet to tell how long he will do it, and if they get in problems later, I can easy save them with a DL while CE is still on... /shrug<br />
<br />
Last time in a chardok group we had a couple of adds because druid healed the pulling monk<br />
*aaarrrghh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kero</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually send them a tell.  &quot;For my heals to be efficient, I need to wait to heal... since I'm here, why don't you go ahead and nuke, and I'll worry about heals.&quot;<br />
<br />
In their defense, they may not have known you were a cleric... I know, I know, but assume that!  Then... if it continues to happen, next druid goes oom, tell your puller, &quot;continue to pull, Cleric FM&quot; and you can show off a bit.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Either one worked well for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ariene</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on who else is in the group, I've done a few different things (while, like you, gritting my teeth).  <br />
<br />
If there is an enchanter, I ask VERY SWEET AND NICE if the druid/shaman could PLEASE help me to keep the enchanter alive and put them in charge of healing the chanter.  I still use remedy now and then but at least they have a 'job' and leave me to do mine. <br />
<br />
I also appoint an official backup healer (if there is more than one choice) and tell him/her that when if I need to med or if I can't cast because I'm getting interupted I'll tell him to please take heals.  <br />
<br />
It seems like if you tell them what you are doing and give them a &quot;job&quot; they are more likely to stick to it.  <br />
<br />
I also give the group frequent updats as to how much mana I have.  This lets the puller know he can pull and also lets the backup healer know he can nuke without fear of me calling on that mana for heals.<br />
<br />
All this was flashback to DL days.  Thank goodness most druids/shaman figure out by mid 40s that they can't really heal nearly as efficiently as the cleric can and they are happy to let you do it.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zyphyr</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The druids/shaman who are jumping in and healing when the Cleric should fall into a couple categories:<br />
<br />
1)They didn't realize that you are a cleric. Not a common occurance, but possible.<br />
<br />
2)They are relatively new to the game and do not realize just how much better Clerics are at healing.<br />
<br />
3)They normally find themselves in Clericless groups and are in the habit of having to play main healer.<br />
<br />
4)They don't really CARE that you are better and want to be primary healer.<br />
<br />
In case #1, mentioning that you are a Cleric will generally suffice to get them to switch to backup healing/offense/etc<br />
<br />
In case #2, you have to take some time to educate them as to what your heals can do vs. what theirs can do.<br />
<br />
In case #3, asking them to switch will work for a while... though eventually it is likely they <br />
will revert later and need a reminder.<br />
<br />
In the 4th case, you have essentially 3 options 1)leave the group, 2)get the group to kick the druid/shamn out, 3)play backup healer/half-ass nuker (generally NOT a desirable option).<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, most of the Druids/Shaman that I know prefer to not have to do any healing so that they can use thier other abilites (myself included - when I want to be a healer I play my cleric not my shaman).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niccy</div><div class="date">07-05-2002, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The few times I have seen this phenomenon it is because the druid (shaman have an obvious job that they are the best it, so it doesn't seem to happen with them so much) actually has the mindset of wanting to be primary healer, but not the tools. I call these 'wannabe clerics'. I usually let them get on with it, because pointing out their relative inefficiency (which deep down they KNOW) would just make them sad. I would rather sacrifice overall group effectiveness than make a group member sad; that's just me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Let them chain SHeal. You just go into stun/mark/nuke mode, and save 50m for when the chanter needs you...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaryllis</div><div class="date">07-05-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A little note here, My main is a Shaman and has to fill the role as the sole Healer in our group. As a Shaman (alt is a Cleric) I would love to leave the healing to the clerics, my debuffs spells are a much better use of my mana.<br />
<br />
I would like to add #5 to Zyphyr's list : The Druid/Shaman doesn't know his own class capabilities. <br />
<br />
Also consider having the Shaman cast regen on the tanks (allows us to feel usefull)!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Med</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh, the old days. Before the Kunark retunings, when DRU &amp; SHM couldn't heal for diddly, we never had this problem and yet, somehow, we all survived it just fine.<br />
<br />
I think you're right about it being class envy. It was class envy that brought about these changes in the retuning. They didn't want to depend on a cleric for healing; it was in violation of their self-appointed right to solo.<br />
<br />
Look for druids to get mez spells in the next batch of caster retuning!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarf02</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Ariene is right on the money.  I have watched several clerics go through these same frustrations.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal effectively changes the way we play our class.  Heck, Superior Heal changes things at level 34.  I am thinking if memory serves that we could heal 2 bubbles with sup heal when we first got it.  <br />
<br />
It just takes a bit of time for druids between the level of 35 and 45 to figure out that they can no way heal as good as we do.  Once they figure it out, they either roll out a cleric or become back up healers or wizards.<br />
<br />
The suggestion to 'assign' someone the job of back up healer or putting someone on chanter duty is very good.  Essentially, the way we look at it, there is no such thing as wasted mana when healing chanters.  Keeping them alive is both difficult and rewarding.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Druids and shaman learn by about level 45 or so, at the latest, that a complete heal is coming and that they don't need to keep the tanks topped off at all times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daere</div><div class="date">07-09-2002, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a level 34 cleric.  When I group with a Shaman or a Druid, I often find that they want to under-heal me.  What I do is tell them how much my biggest heal does, ask each tank how many hit points they have, and then explain, &quot;I will cast when Khatva is down two bubbles or when Felio is down to half health.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shamans and druids get the most efficient heals around - regeneration.  If I ask them to keep that on the main tank and the enchanter, that usually consumes enough mana and gives them enough feeling of contribution that they leave the rest of the heals to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevenim</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a couple of points here from a druid.<br />
<br />
1. In select situations we can be main healers. stress select situations<br />
<br />
2. You need to make an emote like this... /em kicks the druid in the nads for being stupid<br />
<br />
3. I hate it when clerics heal themselves or the chanter.(wizzys also but if they get agro they deserve to die hehe) It's my job to cast those heals the way I see it and a cleric that heals himself is basically saying he does not trust me to do my job.<br />
<br />
4. I hate it when clerics heal me (rarely needs to happen) if they get agro from healing me cause I got stupid then the whole group could be screwed real quick. answer is don't. If I die then I'll take whatever rez you have to offer after the fact, it was my own damn fault and I don't want the whole group at further risk because of it.<br />
<br />
To sum it up I see the druids job when grouped with a cleric as (in this order), snare, regen, DS, any other buffs needed, save the rest to heal the casters and priests, nuke if fm, and NEVER get too LOM to cast an evac<br />
<br />
I can't even imagine trying to play main healer with a cleric in the group, that's just plain dumb and I feel your pain bro, there are idiots in every class. Granted more of them are druids than any other but the reason for that is simple... they had to make a solo class because nobody wants to group with stupid people.<br />
<br />
Hope it comforts you to know that some druids out there know what they are there for. I just hope I'm one of them and don't just think I know what I'm doing hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xygenel</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have run into this a couple of times, and it is damn frustrating.  The times I have seen it, the druid/shaman is unfamiliar on how Comp Heal works and thinks I am asleep at the wheel.  I kindy remind them that I am paying attention and 100% in control of the health of the party.  Usually that works. If it doesnt, take it to tells and explain how it works. Hell, some tanks think I am slacking off when they get below half health.  Something like<br />
<br />
Tank_01: Hey X, you awake.<br />
X: yes )<br />
Tank_01: you gonna start healing.<br />
X: most likely :P<br />
<br />
(Yes, I am sarcastic).  Just be nice about letting them know how it all works at the outset.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerillea</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry - you get this problem with overhealing with other clerics as well, its not just a druid/shaman problem.  It's probably one of the main reasons why groups don't typically want 2 clerics or why clerics seldomly group with each other.  You only notice it more since you tend to have a shaman/druid in group way more often then a 2nd cleric.<br />
<br />
The main problem is that most druids can not estimate damage and proposed damage.  A Shaman generally has a better idea as a shaman usually ends up tanking most of the time..<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I hate it just as much as some of you do.  Casting CH on a tank who needs a 3+k heal, announce it, he's not tanking, and one of the druids/shamans cast Chloroblast on him.  If they had payed attention to my macro they would have known it was taken care of and didn't need to waste their mana.<br />
<br />
On the other end though, I've come across clerics that only CH when a tank is around 20% health regardless if the mob was slowed or not and hard hitting and people just died around that cleric all the time.<br />
<br />
I've seen clerics let CH land on a 5k tank with only 1(1k hp) bubble down against a slowed mob when they could have waited another minute before they really needed to cast CH.  <br />
<br />
What it comes down to, better communication is needed.  As the cleric you should be able to judge when your going to need assist heals and politely tell that backup healer 'If you see x person go below 30% health and you don't see a heal message from me, I'm going to need backup heals'.<br />
<br />
Good clerics also know how to take into effect when a mob is slowed.  A good many clerics don't know if the mob their tank is tanking is slowed or not and results in inefficient heals.  <br />
<br />
If your going to stereotype druids/shamans from a few encounters with them, please let me stereotype the cleric class with the idiots I've come across.<br />
<br />
As a druid I've come across more idiotic clerics then I have druids because frankly speaking I don't group with other druids.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if I grouped equally with druids and clerics I'd find it'd average out that the inefficiency is spread all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amris</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to just say (after ducking out of my heal), &quot;never mind, the druid is the cleric now.&quot;  If polite statements or considerate tells haven't worked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaryllis</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a little something from the other side: Last night I (a shaman) was in a group with a cleric. I sent a tell offering to &quot;keep the chanter alive&quot; thus relieving the cleric from one of characters to cover. He replied that he &quot;had it covered&quot;. this was fine by me. But not 5 mins later we had a large number of adds, resulting with the chanter gaining agro on one of the mobs. Unfortunatly the cleric was busy healing the tanks and had problems targeting. I ended up healing her at 1/2 bub of life. <br />
<br />
So, remember the druid/shaman may be concerned about party members who really deserve healing.<br />
<br />
PS I do have a cleric too, and yes she is MUCH better at healing though only half my shamans level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenu</div><div class="date">07-19-2002, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a problem for me, but then again I'm only level 35 and quite twinked. When my group get a druid or shaman, we usually put him as main healer. I save mana for emergency heasl, and then I do backup melee or Main Tank. Often the later. Clerics are quite good as a melee class actually, at least in the lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obina Redemptus</div><div class="date">07-22-2002, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah the joys of pickup groups in OT and DL! When this happens to me I grin and bear it, but...<br />
<br />
I talk to the enchanter (if there is one) and the main puller about when to pull.  If I am at target mana (usully 60, depends on zone) and chanter is OK, I say pull.<br />
<br />
So if the Druid is OOM and the next pull happens, she needs to med through.  Doesn't happen two pulls in a row! And she learns to keep up, to mana balance the group.  Meaning not to do all the healing.<br />
<br />
If the group refuses to pull when I have enough mana, and the chanter is fine, then it is time to LFG.  This has happened.  In both cases the chanter left with me.  Guess which two had a super group within 5 minutes and which 4 were left bickering?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">07-22-2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Start Tanking mobs.  This at higher levels of course as seeing Clerics Tank at lower levels isn't uncommon.  But seeing Higher level Cleric tank isn't to often and usally starts to worry the warriors.  <br />
<br />
Sounds like a joke, but actually works.  Warriors hate to see their Healer tanking, even if that's not who's really healing them.  To them it's &quot;just not right&quot; and they usually say something to the other person.<br />
<br />
If they don't, that fine too.  99% of my time is Heal, med.  Getting to whack a mob now and then is fun.</div></div><hr />
