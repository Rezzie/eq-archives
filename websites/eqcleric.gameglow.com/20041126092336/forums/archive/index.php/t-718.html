<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olanthe Imaandar</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After a fight with an angry chicken in the Dreadlands last night, I noticed that my AC had gone up by three ticks, from 811 to 814. I scrolled up and sure enough, I had gained a point of defense. Now I have never paid much attention to either AC or my defense skill before, and I had no idea that the effect would be so dramatic. Now I'm thinking this is a skill I greatly need to work on.<br />
<br />
I was both fortunate and unfortunate in my middle years to have excellent groups who never let me take a hit. So now my defense skill is lagging behind at an age when it will be very difficult to raise. So I have a couple questions for you all:<br />
<br />
1. What is the max for defense for a cleric? I have been unable to find this information anywhere. I'm thinking 200, which would mean I have 17 points to go (I'm currently at 183).<br />
<br />
2. What is the best way to raise it as a level 50 character who can tank a little, but not a lot? Now that Ping Fuzzlecutter has been nerfed, I'm thinking the best option might be to dress for AC and INT, find a mob that is blue but doesn't hit all that hard (maybe bloodgill goblins or seafury cyclops), go with a couple healers, root it so it stays on me, and let it beat the snot out of me.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best way is to dress for AC and function as a substitute tank/semi-paladin for caster-heavy groups. Defense 190 here at level 41 - all the recent skill increases have been in groups with no true tank. AC is 768 self-buffed in my full AC outfit (754 in my regular outfit), and I don't have any equip from Kunark or the planes, but I can still tank a dar or bok ghoul knight long enough for a few caster to destroy it. Um, ghoul lord... no. <br />
<br />
3 points of AC per defense point is what I have observed.<br />
<br />
DAing and exposing yourself to zone line trains is another way to do it, if a bit risky.</div></div><hr />

I like to tank too go figure /shrug!<br />
The higher level you get the harder it is to get your skills up, get them up as soon as you can.  blues are good at raising skills, yellows and reds are even beter, but later on anything that is yellow or red to you will... well hand your backside to you in very few rounds, so the likelyhood of your skills going up are lessoned substantialy.<br />

<br />
Agility is directly tied to how quickly you raise defense.<br />
<br />
Get a shaman to buff you with Deleriously Nimble and an enchanter to hit you with Augment.<br />
<br />
Now go get smacked around at a zoneline by as many blues as you can handle.<br />
