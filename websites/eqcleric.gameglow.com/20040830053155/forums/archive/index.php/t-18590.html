<br />
Odysseys (http://www.odysseysxev.com/ ) on the Xev server is currently recruiting. We are looking for some high quality raiders to join our family. <br />
<br />
We are an EP guild that currently lacks the Rathe (almost dead) and Coirnav for Time access. We raid upwards of 6 nights a week, approximately 8:00 PM EST to 2:00 AM EST. <br />
<br />
We are not your typical raiding guild. To us the person behind the character matters as much as the character itself. <br />
<br />
We value and reward contributions to the guild, not just raid participation. We award loot by a merit system – we are not a DKP guild. <br />
<br />
We want to experience and beat Everquest, not just parrot someone else’s recipe. We want people who will put in the effort to learn and master new encounters. We value creative solutions and actively solicit input as we learn. <br />
<br />
We expect people to know the game. We expect you to excel at your class. We expect at least 60% raid attendance on average. <br />
<br />
We require people to be positive thinking and optimistic and fun. We are a guild of mature individuals – do not expect guild chat to be lily white. <br />
<br />
We require disciplined players. If you have A.D.D., and are off your meds or Turet’s syndrome then take it down the road, we are not an equal opportunity employer. We require people to pay attention and follow orders at raids. <br />
<br />
Requirements: <br />
1. Level 65 <br />
2. 100 AA exp or more <br />
3. You must be EP Flagged <br />
4. EB item, shrink item, invis item and right clicky items(for both indoor and out) <br />
5. Resists attainable of 120 or above without buffs <br />
6. Clerics and bards must have epics <br />
<br />
Interested people please contact us by email at: OdyRecruiting@excite.com <br />
<br />
Include the following in your application to us: <br />
1. Your player name <br />
2. The server your applying from <br />
3. Your class <br />
4. Your level, amount of AAs and what you have spent your AA exp on <br />
5. Magelo profile <br />
6. Previous guilds &amp; history of your character <br />
7. Why have you choose to move to the Xev <br />
8. Your raid exp history <br />
9. Is this your original toon you are applying with? <br />
<br />
We love VERY detailed applications So yes impress us by all means please. <br />
