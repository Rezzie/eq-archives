<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">11-21-2000, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, this is my take on soloing spectres.  I did this primarily in OOT and Oasis because the ones in the Feerott are generally camped 24/7 (well, at least the tree spec).  Much of this was also from trial-and-error.<br />
<br />
1)  Spectres can be single-pulled, without lull, safely at 48.  At 47, if more than one was blue, pulling one aggroed the other blues.  Many people will say that you can single-pull at 47, but that's more than likely because the others were green.<br />
<br />
2)  Spectres start to become green at level 47.  Depending on your luck, about half will be green at 47, and about 90% will be green at 48.<br />
<br />
3)  OOT is better to hunt at when you hit 48.  There are 3 spawns.  Just make sure to clear all the gargoyles first.  When I went there, the skeletons were indifferent to me, so I was able to med and pull anywhere on the island without problems.  Plus it's fun to give the scythes to the skels as they walk past   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
4)  Oasis spectres seem to have a longer spawn time than OOT spectres.  I noticed that if I timed it right, I could take all 4 spectres on the main island in Oasis.  In OOT, I was only able to clear 2 spawns before another popped.<br />
<br />
5)  Oasis spectres (for me) dropped better loot (jewelry, gems, words, etc).<br />
<br />
6)  In Oasis, when you are under-48, it's better to pull spectres to the south side of the lake.  Not only is the zone closer, but if you do have to zone, the spectres tend to wander towards the docks slightly less.  When you do hit 48, it's better to stay on the island.<br />
<br />
7)  (This applies only to those who have the Regent symbol of Innoruuk or another slow spell)  When I pulled specs in Oasis to the shore, I found that darking to pull, swimming, refreshing dark, then fearing worked best.  While on the island, and in OOT, use the root-shoot technique.  <br />
<br />
     If you don't have a slow spell, use the root-shoot technique.<br />
<br />
8)  Experience is very good at 47.  It tends to dry up at 48.  2 out of every 5 greens gave me experience at 48.<br />
<br />
9)  At 48, even though you can single pull, you can still get into trouble if there are lower levels pulling.  Make sure you find out how many people are hunting spectres.  It could mean the difference between XP gain and &quot;...LOADING...Please Wait...&quot;<br />
<br />
10) Finally, a lession I learned from Kindergarten, ....  It's better to share   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  This way, the area can be totally safe, you have enough time to get to FM and full health, you have enough time to sell loot, and you can get free SoW or clarity from the people you share with.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.  I had fun doing it, and it helped me get from 47-49 in about approx 20 hrs.<br />
