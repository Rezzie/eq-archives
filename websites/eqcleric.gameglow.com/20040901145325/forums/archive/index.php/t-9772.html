I mean, come on...EVERY time I've leveled, I'm make the ghastly mistake of telling my friends and my guild &quot;DING!&quot; or *gasps* ooc it, and get the customary &quot;Congrats!&quot;, &quot;WTG!&quot;, &quot;Woo hoo!&quot;, etc...and then it starts...I get tell upon tell upon tell...&quot;Can you powerlevel me now?&quot;...and this isn't from just level 10-15 players that are a bit (understandable) frustrated...these are from level 25-45, yes 45 level players (I'm 30, BTW) wanting me to babysit for them...this isn't grouping to maybe get myself a tiny bit of exp, this is watching them attempt to solo while I heal and tank as necessary.  Normally, I'm more than happy to do this...sometimes, the person's even nice enough to give me a bit of the loot we get, but for people to constantly watch them while I sit there for 4-5 hours on end, it gets a bit ridiculous.  I'm sorry if I sound bitter, but I've spent the last day reclaiming the 2 1/2 bubbles I lost because of people making stupid mistakes, like pulling an entire zone of friendlies upon us, and then not running, but thinking I can tank them all...I'm sorry, but even greens and blues get nasty when there's 42 of the things on you...watch &quot;Critter&quot; if you don't know what I mean.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif  I'm finally to the point where I don't WANT to level, because I fear the eminate tells from everyone I know that I feel wrong saying no to without my JerksOfNorrath faction going up.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif  Ok, I've ranted, that's what the board's for, I feel better now...thanks for reading.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
Next time someone asks to be powerlevelled like that, tell them np, then ask them to powerlevel your bank account so you can afford your next spell line.<br />
<br />
I have no problem helping out, heck, plenty have helped me, but sounds like your getting taken advantage of...<br />

I get requests from others that I don't know, but I just often behave like I never heard it... Especially when I get them from a level 8 warrior in full crafted armor.. This guy's got better stuff than I have... &amp;lt;Sigh&amp;gt;</div></div><hr />

If you aren't adequately compensated, don't perform the service - it's that simple. If you're doing it out of the kindness of your heart (and complaining about it), then this is a personal matter of which you should seek advice elsewhere as this board is hardly the place to discuss matters of the heart.<br />
<br />
On Tarew Marr, I rarely see this situation presented to me. When it is, I'm offered obscenely large compensation. At Level 29, a Level 36 ranger offered me 4pp a kill (!) to help him powerelevel. Can't complain about that!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Learnrod</div><div class="date">12-21-1999, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I missing something here?  The reason I chose to become a Cleric was to help others.<br />
  <br />
My favorite things in EQ:<br />
<br />
1.) Sit at a Newbie area and watch for new ones having a hard time, get behind them and heal them to victory.  God I LOVE doing that!<br />
<br />
2.) Sit in entry zone at BB and as the tanks come back to rest, knowing they got to sit for ten minutes healing, boom I heal them get a &quot;Thanks&quot; they get a &quot;My Pleasure&quot; and their back on their way.  It WAS my pleasure...I love it.  Same at safe rooms further down in BB.  Same at T2.<br />
<br />
We Clerics are the only ones who can stand behind someone and allow them to fight 3 levels above their head.  Its Great!<br />
<br />
I've been playing 2 - 3 hours a night 9 nights out of 10 since June, I'm only level 13...got 9pp...I'v helped dozens of people go from level 1 to 5 to see them a month later and their twenty something...some remember me...most don't.  Do I get exp? Plat? Nope!  I get deep personal pleasure...It's FUN...It's WHY I'm a Cleric.<br />
<br />
I see other Clerics running around powerleveling, helping others only when it helps them.  In a Group to keep the Group alive, only so they gain exp and loot!  Why are you a Cleric?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I also love being in a good group at the Bandit Camp holding that hill for an hour, but I rarely loot unless the leader tells me too.<br />
  <br />
Learnrod of Bristlebane doubts he'll even be 20 by the expansion...But I'm having FUN!</div></div><hr />

I often cross the ocean to Freeport when I'm in Mistmoore to go revive a guy...if I see a corpse lying around, I'll do a /who to see if the person is online so I can pitch a revive on him.  I even feel bad for the guys killing Steamfont guards, so I'll &quot;play&quot; guard there, healing and buffing the newbies running around.  They love me there.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  I just had a crappy day that day, hit my level then ended up half way into my previous level at the end of the day...wasn't looking for advice, I know I'll go out the next day and powerlevel someone again...just my nature...only was venting until the coffee was done.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif   Thanks for listening guys.<br />

If I see someone in trouble, or if someone needs me, I'll help no problem. I won't sit for hours power lving someone for nothing, after all, &quot;I wanna lvl!!&quot; The only people power lving me is my own Guild. Part of playing the game is playing it, lvling, getting loot adventuring etc. I can't do that babysitting newbies. I make my appearences and make peoples day, but I won't be a slave to everyone in Norrath. If people need a Res and I'm nearby there is no question I'd help. I've even binded people for free all the time, cuz I rememeber what it was like. It would be nice that a fellow cleric would power lvl me, like I do for them..I do admit I help them the most, cuz there my class and brothers and sisters. strange some of the people I meet don't think that way<br />

I like to find a newby in their racial newby zone and buff them up, or if I have the time, teach them how to prosper.  Helps to make them able to hold their own especially at level 1 which is very tough for new people.  I will heal other people nearby when I am soloing if they are about to die or I am feeling generous with my time.  If they start getting in over their heads often enough that I suspect they are taking advantage of me to pull tougher mobs than they should, I leave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go to the newbie zones and give a whole bunch of people bravery or your similar level spell and watch how crazy they go killing every damn thing in site! That extra HP and AC at that level make a HUGE difference when fighting almost any creature in the newbie zones.<br />

<br />
On Christmas day a lvl 40+ Cleric who read my earlier post sought me out at T2 and explained to me that a nearby hill had become infested with Bandidts and needed to be cleansed.  I explained that, that was beyond me...Learnrod see's mystic symbols and MYGOD I got 700+ HP!!!  Hehe, this guy followed me to the Bandit camp sat in the corner and allowed me...a LVL 13 Cleric... to hold the hill by myself till I made 14 and was so loaded down with Bandit sashes and loot that I was encumbered...LOL!<br />
<br />
I had so much loot that I was able to buy ALL of my level 14 spells, some banded, and several plat worth of Cat eyes...That evening there were many more newbies at Qeynos gate then normal...prob got EQ for Christmas...Many saw mystic symbols:-) and the ensuing rat / bat / snake slaughter was amazing...poor Fippy Darkpaw didn't know what hit him when 5 newbies with 100+ HP mowed him down...It made a great Christmas for me and many others.<br />
<br />
Forget cheese..behold the power of the Cleric!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llew Lifebringer</div><div class="date">01-12-2000, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes these &quot;novice&quot; days are a little hard to explain.  I've so far succeeded in having *every* single adventurer in Blackburrow having Bravery at the same time.(much harder in the kelethin area)  Shortly afterward, someone clueless was flaming me for being in the zone as too high a level.  <br />
<br />
Just keep shouting that you're there to help, help those that ask, and stop helping those that expect you to be their personal guard for more than a few minutes...<br />
<br />
I once took 2 other folks with me on a blessing rampage.  An enchanter (clarity,) a Shaman (stats and SoW,) and myself.  About a half hour into it, a busy zone started being inundated with shouts of &quot;Hey, where'd all the critters go?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">01-13-2000, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, this all sounds good and such, but sometimes buffing people can be detrimental to their health.  I'm currently at level 46 and I have a friend that has a 16th level monk.  I thought I was helping him when I buffed him with resolution, armor of faith and symbol of pinzaarn.  He got the impression that he was superman and starting trying to take out yellow and red crocs.  Well he was doing fairly well with his buff until he engaged in a fight with a red croc and the buffs wore out about half through the fight.  Needless to say he died.  Then he wanted a res.  After I did the res, I healed him and started to walk away.  He then asked aren't you going to rebuff me?  I replied back to him, I wasn't planning on it since it made you feel like superman and you go out trying to kill everything that moved.  He wasn't too happy with that answer.  But had I continued to buff him like that, he would probably have continued to try to solo the yellow and red crocs and probably would have died repeatedly when the buffs ran out.  So sometimes too much of a good thing can be bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This rant session was fun to read, it came out of a rant and became something good about Clerics.  This is what we are made of!!!<br />
<br />
Hurrah for the Clerics of Norrath!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Srakk</div><div class="date">01-20-2000, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Learnrod, thats really cool that you like to help people.. you are missing out on a lot though. if you think you are capable of helping people at lvl 13, you should see how much more powerful you get at helping them later on in levels<br />
<br />
I suggest you take a break from Kaladim and go get some levels. you will be amazed at every spells level how much more fun your cleric is, and how much more you are able to help people. thats my favorite part about this game, you continue to get more powerful, and continue to be challeneged with tougher mobs. its a great game, I think you should level up a bit and see what else it has to offer!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">01-20-2000, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The higher up you go, the better you can help people. I often cast buffs on newbies, or anyone lower than me when I have extra mana and am passing through a zone. If they're newbies, I often caution them about taking on something too hard when that buff wears... If they're 14, they should know this by now, and often do...<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear your monk friend didn't understand...<br />
<br />
I res bodies I find in passing, but I often pass on resses when I am grouped, simply since group survival is so much more important.<br />
<br />
Being a cleric can be alot of fun. Getting up in levels to a res ability is SO helpful to people, especially in places like CT, where some people are bound 7 zones away.</div></div><hr />
