<br />
I hate to open this can of worms... Last night on our server.... As all higher level clerics are used to...<br />
<br />
Someone was shouting/pleading/demanding and offering bribes for a RES ..any res ...that will give him some of his lost exps back! This is the fourth time I have died tonight... Blah Blah Blah<br />
<br />
As fate would have it a level 29 cleric that was very proud of her new spells kindly Shouted that she would be more then happy to do a Revive if the poor victum would drag his corpse to the zone.<br />
<br />
Well A huge /SHOUTing and /OOCing match started. Half of the clerics and clerical wannabe's claim that Revive only summons you to your corpse with no exps returned .. the other half claimed that you got at least a 10% return on the exps lost.<br />
<br />
To make a long ugly story a little short.. The arguement ended up getting ugly with one cleric training 3 baddies on the Young cleric and her revived friend! Petitions were filed screen, shots taken,, GM'S showed up within 3 minutes!! and a the offending cleric was no longer logged on and I havent seen him since!<br />
<br />
One of the GM's stated that Revive does return a little exp... the other claimed he didnt know.<br />
<br />
So... lets try to settle this without etting ugly..<br />
<br />
<br />
Does Revive give back Exp's?<br />
If so how much?<br />
<br />
How much does the remainder of the line return?<br />

<br />
The player will receive a generic message with the revive that said you have gained some experience from resurrection, but you do not actually gain any lost exp. <br />
<br />
Some *claim* to see their experience bar move back up after a revive, but that is just wishful thinking on their part.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears it up some for you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonandor</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The lvl 29 res has restored some xp, only if cast in the same zone as both corpse and player I have tested this on myself and see a noticable gain into an empty bubble. I have not used this spell since the last ress patch (2hr limit on ressing). I have also noticed that the lvl 39 spell seems on average to return more xp to players if they are NOT in the same zone as there corpses, so maybe the coding for the lvl 29 and 39 spells were somewhat mixed up. Again I have no data on this since the last patch.<br />
Also I have had a couple of people saying that they got zero xp back from the lvl39 ress and that they didnt even get the &quot;you have regained some experience&quot; message.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rafeco</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea that the amount of experience restored by our resurrection line varies depending upon whether the dead person and their corpse are in the same zone sounds bizarre and implausible to me.<br />

<br />
You wanted to know how a discussion between 2 clerics turned into a zone wide problem?<br />
<br />
The older clerics opening shout was something like &quot; You stupid B**ch dont you know that revive dosent give any exps! &quot; <br />
<br />
From there it went quickly downhill.<br />
<br />
As a side note... I saw this clown in solb shouting for help getting his corpse this weekend..  I couldnt pass on the chance to offer him a Revive!<br />

He states that revive does not restore lost exp. And it has been tested. Resucitate up to 50%. Forgot to ask him about Ressurrect but I think it's 80%.<br />

<br />
1) The spell had been changed to return some exp in the last patch.<br />
2) He got the &quot;some of your lost exp has been restored&quot; message (can't remember exactly how that one goes).<br />
3) He said he got 1/4 of a bubble back at L33, not a lot but at least something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramus</div><div class="date">12-04-1999, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question:<br />
<br />
Have any of you been screwed when you revived/recussed someone?  What I mean is when they offer to pay you money, but they are unable to get to their body to pay you.  <br />
<br />
Do you not do it until they atleast loot their money and you get paid?  What if they can't get to their body?  Do you take their word for it?  I'm just curious.  I'm only lvl 25, but I'm looking forward to that spell for my guildmates and friends, but I hope to make some money off it as well.  If wizy's can charge 10pp to tele, I can charge 10-20pp to revive them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
last night a wizard i revived, who was in the same zone as me in lguk (before i revived him) said that he saw noticeable exp gain. <br />
<br />
shrug, i tried it on myself and didn't see anything but.. maybe u wont get any exp by ressing yourself ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalmask</div><div class="date">12-06-1999, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, you have the 2 hour limit if you die to a mob, but only 15 minutes if the person dies in a duel...as far as exp gains, I can't say for sure, because I'm only 28 right now. hehe  But what I've READ from a number of sites, Revive is merely a teleport, no exp, resussitate (sp, I know) restores up to 40%, and Resurrect is up to 90%...but again, just what I've read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminar</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long ago when I only had revive.. I revived myself (So I was in the same zone obviusly) and got no exp back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badaf</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The time limit for resses on a dueled corpse is 10 minuntes the dot. Believe me i know. Because this is how we get gear back from dead corpses on the PoF. We duel, then we buff, sow and invis the person. They zone into PoF. When it looks safe they start looting. When a mob sees them or they get done they message me to revive them. If they only got partial equipment, they duel again. They leave their recovered stuff on their corpse and repeat, until the loot it all. THis method works great because you can accept the revive request while you are running. So if i monster jumps you can you take off, hitting your &quot;REVIVE NOW&quot; hotkey, and accept the pop-up on the run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I figured something out. I remembered this argument running for a few days, and I just got the spell a couple days ago.<br />
<br />
Didn't have a chance to cast it until last night, so... I checked my xp bar before I cast it, and checked it afterwards. A mere sliver. Not worth even calling an xp res at all, but it didn't hurt either. (Died in Hell level 1, revive doing probably 1 pixel?..., I was right at a bar, and went right over the lip of it, otherwise I wouldn't have noticed either). A paladin I revived said the same thing. A tiny bit. Take this little sliver to say level 35, 38, I don't think you'd even NOTICE it anymore. This could have a little to do with the message, but no one seeing anything moving.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents, and if I wasn't watching for it specifically, I probably wouldn't catch it either.</div></div><hr />
