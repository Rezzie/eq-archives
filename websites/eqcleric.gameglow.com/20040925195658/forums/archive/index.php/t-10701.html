At 47 and up (maybe 46) you can pull stuff solo from a distance.  There are several places this works great in.  Killing the ritualist at 46 (and the 2 other wizzies spots) was pretty easy.<br />
<br />
At 48 I'm now pulling the executioner, crusader, and sage to the savant room (keep that cleared).  It's a blast when no one else is in Guk (early morning is best for this).<br />
<br />
If you do get a zol- they have tons of hit points and a higher magic resistance that most of the other frogs up to that point, so you'll have some down time from this one.<br />
<br />
Most Vis Knights or Wizzies take 2 Banish Undead, maybe an extra Force thrown in for good measure.  Wans will take 3 Banish Undeads.<br />
<br />
It's funny to see your experience bar move after all this time (solo is so different from groups).</div></div><hr />

I was able to pull solo at 46, but not 45.  Then you have to have or make a clear spot to pull to.  Then it's pretty easy.  I even pulled the savant through a wanderer (blue Wan Knight) to the cav room without agroing the wan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bandayd</div><div class="date">11-16-1999, 09:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Thkeron, since we are on the same server and all, and same level, just wanted you to know that we go down to Lower Guk every night (11pm to 3am Central Standard Time) and you are more than welcome to come!  We usually meet up in the Savant room, and clear out everything under the tower (Savant, Cavalier, Sage, Executioner) until everyone arrives.  The level 50s really don't mess with clerics too much any more of the cleric is 44+.  I think we all know why *cough*Banish Undead*cough*.  Any ways, then we go to the never ever camped DEEP dead side of Lower Guk, past the Arch Magi and kill Zol Knights and Frenzied Froglocks.  Nice exp, I am in hell level (45) and got a bubble and a half last night in about 2 hours.  And yes, we even has a level 50 paladin with us (Ezeke).  Anyways, give me a /tell or Xanex a /tell.  We'll be glad to group with ya if you are sick of Sol B.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traturn</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best spots to pull to i found:<br />
<br />
the hallways nearest the cav room<br />
<br />
tunnel between tower and magi/lord/frenzy area.<br />
<br />
Hall towards Frenzy area<br />
<br />
<br />
2nd floor, near where the scuicidal wan is, above or on the savant area..... basicaly anywhere you can root, keep line of sight on the mob and nuke without froggies closeby.<br />
<br />

Me (level 47 cleric) and qalar (level 49 enchanter) got in group last night. We did amazing things before, and we did so again.<br />
Together with a necromancer (without pet), monk and a ranger, we managed to break spawn and kill the froglok king, even though the poor monk died while pulling king. <br />
( tactician blow him away ) <br />
 Earlier this took 2 full groups. But if you have a monk, enchanter and a quick cleric, yo can still do it.  Heck, we didn't even have a tank or a wizard ! =)<br />
 XP was great, loot was awesome, the excitement was on the edge at all times.<br />
 We ended up with a mithril 2handed sword, platinium tiara and several other smaller loots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">11-25-1999, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great Advice Guys!   I was kinda getting bored looking for stuff to do until my guild and our allies caught up to me in levels.  Being on a Racewar server, the population is always pretty low.  Im glad there is at least one high level dungeon we can solo for good exp (but at 50 that doesnt matter)   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif and get some good items.  <br />
Anyway after reading the thread I went to LGuk and learned the safe places and where to pull.  I still die a couple times a night because I get lazy at times and dont clear the wanderers.  Since I bind and can rez though it really doesnt impact me much except for more downtime.  I generally pull and med right next to the sage room (has the least amount of wanderers that area).  I find that I can keep the sage, executioner, savant, cavalier, and most of the wanderers cleared (~30 min on each spawn).  Anyway in 3 nights of hunting (often Im the only person in LGuk)   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  Ive gotten: 3 executioner axes, 5 exe hoods, 6 BE maces, 1 BE BP, 1 Runed Cowl, 1 Cinch Cord.  Its been great and Ive given almost all the items to deservering guildmates (most who are 30 to 40+).   Now if  I can find a way to avoid all those calls for rez in East Karanas and Sol B.  Hehe Kinda sucks being one of 2 clerics on the server that can cast resurrection.  BTW I always give way to a group that wants to hunt the tower.<br />
