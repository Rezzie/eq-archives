</FONT><HR>As Rayne pointed out in another thread, NBG can be abused alot. Especially in pick-up groups. I figure we could start a thread and air it out a bit. <P>First, we should define NBG. <P>#1: If an item drops and someone in the group needs it (i.e. doesn't currently have that item or a better item) then that group member gets it, automatically. <P>#2: If the person who could use the item has it or something better, or there is no one in the group who can use it, then it gets lottoed to the whole group.<P>Personally, since I have returned, I have only received 2 items, BOTH due to NBG. Everything else I have was purchased. And NBG was not even heard of before I left.<P>One night, in KC, my group was fighting near zone, when somehow, someone pulled the Drolvarg Warlord (and nothing else) to the zone. We jumped it, killed it and got Donal's  Boots. They handed me the boots immediatly and had no issues at all. I wore them for 3 days, and was offered 7k and a Spirit Tome for them. Seeing how I was still wearing mostly borrowed gear, I sold (way underprice, so the Cleric who bought them got a real good deal) and went shopping.<P>About 3 days after that, I was in the Hand room of KC and we pulled the Warlord and a pair of Donal's Boots dropped. Again, the group didn't hesitate and gave them to me. About a week later, I saw Ninda auctioning to buy a pair, and she offered 20kpp for them. I declined. I didn't need the cash, I was equipped in my own gear, and I didn't really want to part with the boots, not even for such a sweet deal. I still have the boots and will not sell until I get something better. And even then, I may just pass the boots down to a guildmember.<P>Were it not for NBG, I would still be wearing borrowed gear, and I would still be broke. I have watched countless high end items drop in KC that went to the rangers/monk/whoever, that I didn't even get the chance at, due to NBG, and I do not begrudge them their item at all. On all items that dropped that my group(s) rolled for, I have never won a single one. But I feel good knowing that I was only rolling for an item that no one else needed. Had I had to roll for both pairs of my boots, and lost them to another class, I would have felt cheated.<P>How do the rest of you feel about NBG?<p>[This message has been edited by Dikmer (edited 04-05-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I am all for NBG even in pick up groups.  I for one would feel cheated if Donals dropped and I had to roll for it.  So I stick to that when things for other classes drop.  I find that in the upper level game you run into the same people again and again. Its worth passing on a phat lewt to make a friend.  This is probably why I rarely join pick up groups and don't stay in ones that roll on everything.<P><P>------------------<BR>Kenobe Wan<BR>Healer of the 53rd Circle<BR>Praxium Knight<BR>Cazic-Thule<P>"And one time, at cleric camp, I...."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think it also depends on the definition of "need". How much do you NEED the item? "If somebody offers reasonable pp I can sell it" kind of need, or "I won't trade it until I get something better for that slot" kind of need?<P>So, no offense, but I would be disappointed if I saw the person who got the item by default selling it after 3 days. And I wouldn't want to group with the person if I saw him/her getting the same item more than once by default.<P>------------------<BR>Rolant Starfield<BR>High Priest of Rodcet Nife<BR>Courageous Few<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

I never really expected to get a second pair either. I was in the hand room hoping for gloves, not boots. <P>But the first pair came down to me thinking that I could keep the boots, or I could return all the borrowed stuff. Most nights in KC, after restocking my gem bag, I found myself banking  less than 200pp a night, often less than 50pp, and a few times 0pp. I didn't see how I could ever afford to by anything at that rate.<P>However, seeing how the going rate for Donal's Boots seems to be in the 15kpp to 20kpp range, selling the first pair for 7kpp was a great deal for that Cleric. I kinda fell like we both made out good on that. If I could remember for the life of me who was in the group I got the first pair off of, I would try to make it up to them, but I don't know how I could.<P>****Edited in: And the main problem is, this whole thing kinda reminds me of the whole Bladestopper issue that cause me all those problems last June, and eventually lead me to getting hacked and quitting EQ altogether. <BR>I went on a Naggy raid, they put me in for one of the 2 Bladestopper's that dropped and I won. I didn't want it, but I felt I earned it due to my participation and I died like 5 times. A couple days later, I traded it for a Medicine Totem that I did need/want/use, but caught all kinda of grief over for trading a dragon item that as a cleric I shouldn't have rolled on. I felt that once I won it, it was mine to do with as I saw fit. Everyone else felt that if I wasn't going to use it, I should never have accepted it. God, what a mess. And yet, I can tell you I have seen at least 4 Bladestopper's for sale over the last couple weeks.<P>Need before greed, to me, means if you don't have better, you need it. If you get batter later, then the old item is your's to do with as you see fit. I am sure the 3 or 4 ranger's who got a Nature's Wrath in my groups due to NBG will sell it the second they get something better. And that is perfectly fine with me. Hell, I wouldn't even care if they sell it to buy a better BP. It's theirs, they can do whatever they want with it. And if I am grouped with them a few days later and they are sporting a new BP and could use another Nature's Wrath, then good luck and I hope one drops for ya.<P>Of course, I guess only having 1 char over 14, I don't get jealous over other peoples good fortune. As long as I am wearing fairly good equip (as I am now) I don't really care what drops and who gets it.<p>[This message has been edited by Dikmer (edited 04-05-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>Thats pretty low actually, if you sold the boots your group let you have. Thats not Need before Greed. Thats simply Greed. <P>This is why I don't like NBG, because unless you are melee class very few items drop specifically for you, melee has alot of cross over with priest items too.<P>A melee can always claim he needs something, then he turns around and sells it later like you did with the boots.<P>If people opt out of a lotto to give you something then you shouldn't in good concious sell that item later, because anyone can sell an item or twink it down.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>We had a situation similar to this a little while back.  We went to CoM and killed the 2nd reaver.  He dropped the Ornate Runed Shield and it went to the Enchanter by NBG default.  A few days later, the enchanter traded it for a Hierophant Cloak.  I felt kind of upset about this at the time, the cloak is a nice item for everyone, not just enchanters.  <P>Well, we went back to the 2nd reaver a few months later and got another Ornate Runed Shield.  It went to general lotto, because the enchanter already had one from a previous raid.  The paladin that won, got a Sword of the Morning for it.  <P>NBG once, but not twice.<P>Who's to say that other people don't sell their NBG stuff as well.  I'll have to agree though, that if I was in Dikmer's 2nd group and 1st group, I would of had to say something before I handed them over a second time.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>How we handle things in my group (regular group, all guild mates):<P>-> Those who NEED the item roll.  Usually it's just awarded, but if two feel they need it they can just roll.  None of us are exactly hurting for loot =P.<P>-> If nobody needs the item then we look at the guild as a whole.  If we think there is someone in the guild who would give them item a nice home we hold for later.<P>-> Otherwise, we all roll.<P>-> If someone who was awarded an item TRADES/SELLS that same item, the next time it drops they are not considered for the item unless we all roll.<P>The only place these rules exist formally is my head (and therefore not formal), but that's how we've handled things for a long time now.<P>As I said in another thread I don't do pickup groups (with an SK and Cleric I've already got the basis of a group, I can always borrow a friend's Shaman or Enchanter if I need to solo), but if I DID do a pickup group, I'd roll on anything that wasn't No Drop.  If I want/need an item I get my friends to camp it for me, not 5 strangers.  I've read so many horror stories, both pro/con NBG, that straight /lotto just seems the best way to deal with it.<P>I used to feel differently and laid out very stringent rules to strangers (ie. NBG was the rule) who joined my group.  It's just not worth it to me anymore, so I don't invite strangers and don't have loot hassles to deal with =P.<P>As far as Dikmer's case, well, IF he explained to his group that this was his SECOND pair of boots, and why he sold his first,etc, and they STILL awarded to him, great.  Otherwise, the second should have been /lotto'd, in my opinion.<P>I suspect my opinion on items is very jaded since I don't do pickup groups, so take what I say with a big grain of salt.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>NBG is so wide open for abuse.<P>In pickup groups, the only way to be absolutely 100% fair is to lotto all items (tradeable) randomly among all participants, regardless of prior loots, time spent with the group, etc.  EQ's relatively efficient market allows players to trade for useful items so that the loot distribution is fair in the long-run.<P>Of course, in guild groups we practice a communist-like loot distribution policy, but that works because we know who has what items and who recently got which loots.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, lets twist this a bit, and see what you guys say...<P>Let's say that instead of boots, the second time around, Gloves dropped (which is what I was there for anyway). I have EM (AC12, 5dex, 5int, 7fire) and the group gives me Donal's (AC16, effect AoF). Then say I see a pair of Gauntlets of the Black (AC15, 4str, 3wis) for 1500pp. So I work out a deal to trade Donal's Gloves for the GotBlack + alot of pp. Now, GotBlack are 1 less AC but have 3wis and 4str. Much beter IMHO. I use the cash to buy other equipment I could use.<P>Is this any different than selling boots for a whole bag of better equipment?<P>I guess the problem with NBG is people hold everything you do under a microscope. As far as I am concerned, NBG is for the 5 other people you are grouped with NOW. Who cares what they do with the equipment once it's theirs. If they need it NOW, they get it NOW and can bank/sell/trade/give it away later. I don't care if it is a month or a week or even an hour after the group breaks up. I don't try  to keep track of who got what in the groups I get in. Cause quite simply, I don't care. I have gotten 2 items in over a month, and really, the people involved were happy for me, and it's only OTHER people who weren't even there who think I did something wrong.<P>I still feel NBG works better, even for pick-up groups. Cause there are always gonna be people like me who never win a lotto.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Granted i don't know exactly what happend to Dikmer, and though i've talked to him a few times in game i don't know him all that well to judge him. However I think his case was a special one. Nearly all of the equipment he had was borrowed because he had his account hacked and everything was stolen. <P>The fact that he sold 1 pair of boots, no matter how much or how little he got for them isn't the issue, he did need the boots. BUT he also needed his own equipment and those boots funded that. The people grouping with him knew about his situation and if I had been one of those people I wouldn't have even hesitated, he would have gotten just about everything that dropped unless I absolutely needed it and even then i would have though about it.<P>I do understand what Zygote is saying though, he is worried about people who would abuse that type of system and it will happen. If Dikmer had not lost all of his equipment and was selling the boots for profit then yes I would say it was greed. The system however is a very good one, it ensures that people get better equipment and everyone who comes along for the ride gets something. <P>Personally I would rather a few people abuse this type of system than loose roll after roll and never get anything at all. Or the reverse, if I won all the rolls for items I didn't need. I would and have given things away because i felt a group member needed them more and i had no right to that item. I have even included myself in rolls on someone elses behalf and told everyone because they were greedy pigs.<P>If you see someone abusing NBG then just tell the group that you will roll for the next drop of that item because player X is selling it and doesn't need it. If they dont' like it then leave.<P>Can it be abused? Yes. but I think this is the best loot system out there right now, it gives everyone a fair shot at things they need and a fair shot at items that could be sold that no one needs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The biggest problem with NBG is, what defines Need? A cleric could argue "I need those cobalt gauntlets" based on the fact that if they win, they can then trade them for something he does need. Think about it. Noone (well noone 50+) cares who loots those Fine Steel weapons. Why? Because they have no value in trade to others. They are not "needed". Any item that is considered NBG for that group, can be argued by everyone as being needed by them.<P>Now the other side.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Generally as you get up in levels, you start to get to know everyone. As such, being nice and being generous (i.e. being a good group mate) will always work in your favor. Your reputation will determine how others react to you. As such, if you get the label of greedy, many will not associate with you, invite you on raids, etc. In addition you will often find yourself grouping with many of the same people. In this situation it is to your advantage in the long run for them to also be well equipped.<P>IMHO there's a lot of good arguments on both sides. Many more than I stated here. As long as people state up front the method being used, as well as being honest about it, I'm happy. Hey, I'm 54th level and I'm still wearing a Foremans tunic. Equipment, while always nice, is not my primary goal.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Kovina Bloodfang<BR>54 Cleric (Ooooo so close to 55)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I'm going to go ahead and discourage your (Dikmer) action here.  I agree with what a few others said.<P>In your case, NBG allowed you to have the boots the first time.  There was an assumption made that you would _wear_ them.  If your group members would have known that you were going to sell them, then I doubt that they would default them to you.  The other members could have sold the boots too.  <P>You mentioned that you had an exception since the majority of your gear is borrowed.  That does not justify what you did since it's possible that other members had exceptions as well.  Let's not assume that your needs are 'better' than others.<P>Furthermore, you acquired a second pair of boots due to NBG.  Again, your members assume that you _need_ the boots because you are going to wear them.  This time, you keep them.  <P>Why not sell the new boots and go back to camp them again.  NBG will work with you!<BR>Then go off and sell those!<P>Perhaps we should now ask the question: How many times can we sell the same item which we acquire via NGB?  3 times? 4?<P>Urzak<BR>Quellious<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><BR>You said NBG matters NOW with the group you are in NOW.  Well of course, to a certain extent thats true.  If I knew I was going to PoH next week, and everyone said the first gloves would default to me cause I was wearing quest gloves... then Donal's drops in Karnors... of course I'm going to take them... no one knows what the future holds... but to turn around and sell them is wrong.<P>Playing the NOW game is exactly one reason why melee's get off so well in Kunark... because NOW they need that Sword of Coolness because when they won it NOW 2 nights ago they sold it, and get to win it again.<P>You cannot twist what you did to be right.  Some may agree with you and even do the same thing... but in the spirit of NBG, you were WRONG.  In no way, does NBG say take and sell it, because ANYONE there can do that.  Sometimes, you'll be defaulted an item, and yes... you will turn around and a few days or week later get a better item.  That's fine... and yes, then it's even fine to sell your item.  But it implies that if you got Donal's boots... managed to get Joe's Boots which are better, you would then NOT get Donal's boots again, because you have better.<P>You avoided the "I have better" by trading your boots for other gear, and thus "needing" the boots again.<P>Everyone makes thier own choices, but choices like yours are why I love and hate NBG at the same time... with the rarity of boots and gloves (as an example) when I got to KC, quite frankly if I'm the only cleric there I want them defaulted... because I want to use them.  At the same time, I don't want people farming on NBG... which is what you did in esscene... you may or may not have PLANNED on getting boots again... but fact is you did.  If the group had rolled and you won... as I said, then that's perfectly fair... everyone got thier chance.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Dik, what you did with the Donal's boots was an abuse of the NBG system. Once you get an item once via NBG, you should not accept it on that basis again.<P>I had something similar occur to me with Donal's arms - I got a pair via NBG which I sold a while later, since at that time I needed the strength from the EM and the cash to buy tinker's bags. Next time I was in a group that got a pair of Donal's arms, I refused to accept them on NBG and said all should roll. I won them anyway  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Still, what you did is why a lot of people get pissed off about NBG. Sure you have the right to sell something that you win via NBG, but you should not accept that same item again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>First of all, Donal's Gaunts are much much much, 10 times, >>> GoB. Donal's Gaunts easily sells for a boatload more money than the boots.<P>Armor buffs are VERY mana-expensive. Most clerics can afford to armor buff one tank, maybe two in your average group. AoF is pretty darned close to SoW, SoW isnt much of an improvement, and with these gaunts, everyone in the group gets armor buffs without using any mana at all. I got these gaunts a few months ago, and I have declined getting the Thurgadin Quest gloves since then because of this effect.<P>Second, my own opinion, my stande on NBG is very strict and not negotiable. In any group, from raids to garbage Karnors groups, it is NBG. If something as wonderful as RBG drops in Sebilis, it would be absolutely despicable for a caster to force a roll and essentially deny the group's tank from getting an unbelievable "dream" item, so that the caster can stroll to EC the next day and hock it to the highest bidder.<P>What's my NBG mean? If you would use it, as in you would put it on right now, then you need it. If more than one needs, they roll, unless the item is obviously a huge upgrade for one person and a slight upgrade for another. No one needs, all roll. This applies to spells too, and those casters who whine about NBG, you often will see them demand their spells given to them, as if their needs for spells is somehow greater than a tank's need for nice AC equipment. They cant have it both ways, 55+ spells can be sold too, so either everything is NBG, or none of it is. Abuse? Innocent untill proven guilty. For the most part, most folks do not take advantage of NBG. (by this I mean you take that item and sell it for something else, without first getting a different item that is an upgrade in that slot to what you had received. Once you upgrade an item, theres no reason to keep it in the bank if you dont want to.)<P>I always make sure the group is NBG right after joining a group. If the group refuses NBG, I *will* leave, and they can find a different cleric. I'm not going to let myself see a nice piece of Donal's get randomed off to a wizard :P How often do you see Donals sold?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Really its just about being fair.<P>For a pickup group you gotta think fairness over the short term and for a guild its cool because you can plan over the long term (and get better success).<P>NBG is a strategy for fairness.  If you still to it unthinkingly or criticize those who break it for the "right" reasons then you are missing the point.<P>Ultimately for me I get a real rush seeing people win stuff that they can put to immediate use.  This is fun but not always possible.  Be mindful of where you are hunting.  If you are camping the frenzy then NBG is not fair over short term (only melee types can win and they may not sell right away but they will sell eventually) but may be over the long term (make some friends who remember you in the warlord room in KC?).<P>Be fair minded at heart and NBG won't even matter.  You will KNOW who deserves what and when.  Consider everyone in your group and give everyone as fair a chance as possible to profit from your adventures and you won't upset anyone.<P>I like the story that started this thread because some will criticize it as abuse of NBG but if you look at the later posts you will see that the clerics groupmates where cool and supportive and NBG was just a means to getting a down on his luck cleric equiped.<P>Think about it.  If you where fighting in the warlord room with a warrior who had crap for equip and you where in full templars.  Donal's drops.  Who "NEEDS" it?<P>Anyways thats my rant for the day - be happy be nice, its a game - have fun!!!<P>Brambodius</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok NBG is the big question here.  I don't think Dink did the wrong thing in selling the first pair he got.  Come on people<BR>if your account was hacked and you lost your<BR>eq and had a lot of borrowed stuff you too would probably sell some items to get yourself equiped.<P>Secondly NBG is abused sometimes buy people that don't really need the items and sell them for profit but at the end of the day thats their decision.  We as clerics are always poor it seems and there is alot more items out there for Melees that sell for alot more than majority of our items so a Melee will always have more cash than us it seems if NBG was always used, one big counter balance to this is the looting of cash and gems in certain zones we do get some nice loots in a few zones.<P>I would be very upset if I was forced to roll in a group where donals stuff dropped and I didn't have it thats just not right... But then again that also applies to me if something nice for a melee drops.  It really comes down to common sense here and thinking of others before yourself hence greed.  It does seem that there are alot more greedy players around on many servers though IMHO, is that a maturity issue possibly remembering that many players are teenagers and young adults which still have some growing up too do?  I don't know think about it.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Need Before Greed is something I try very hard to adhere to.  My guild's loot policy reflect the concepts as well.  Of course I rarely hunt in pickup groups.  Normally I have at least one other guildmate and when our policys are presented most people like them.  <P>Basically we have have 4 rules we follow.<BR><OL TYPE=1><BR><LI>Loot goes to who can and will use the item.<BR><LI>When no one *needs* the item, we either give to a guildmate that does need or for whomever's seconds need.<BR><LI>Everyone gets one item before anyone gets a second item.<BR><LI>Once everyone has one item, it starts back over at the begining.<BR></OL><P>We try to enforce this when we have pickup groups as well as full guild groups.   On raids the policy is to have the senior guild officer attending the raid decide who gets what.  Works when on alliance raids between 3 guilds as well.  Though I tend to always think others will need something more then I would, so as Guild Leader I get very few items.<P>Our 40's crowd has been romping in City of Mist lately.  Few NBG situations we had come up.  First day a Goo drops Heroic Bond, which was promptly handed to me, the only cleric.  (Talk about stunned!)  Second day, lead by a mad bear, we take down Lord Ghiosk.  Low and behold a Thorneblade drops.  Thing was, the warrior (ally) didnt want it!  So with group consensus it went to my warrior.  Third day there with myself, guild enchanter and rogue, we pick up an ally warrior again.  An apparition drops a GJB and without even thinking we handed it to the warrior.  (Lucky fellow!)  <BR>From all accounts we had some amazing luck getting loot there, as most everyone walked away with something (2 rings, 2springwood clubs, 3wintry clubs, 2wrathbone hammers, 1GJB, 1Thorneblade Yak, level 52 spell and few other things I have forgotten now) in the two weeks we have been there.<P>Yes this has the opportunity to be abused, BUT with the rule that "Everyone gets something before anyone gets a second" helps cut down hard feelings.<P>I beleive that what benefits one, benefits us all.  Thus should a guild warrior get some uber loot, thats GREAT that they got it! It only HELPS us as a guild be more effective.  <P>Almost all my gear, when it becomes outdated or improved, gets donated down to whoever in the guild needs it.  So should I fully retire my warrior I will pass the Thorneblade down. Course that makes me rather poor, but rich in friends.<P>------------------<BR>~Calimayrn Anam'Cara<BR>46th Cleric of Tunare<BR>~Calizana Rhinelander<BR>Floating Barbarian Champion<BR><A HREF="http://www.lostorder.com" TARGET=_blank>Lost Order of Akalabeth</A><BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
