We're very aware of it, and it's a priority of ours to finish. I understand that it's taking more time than players would like, and it's definately taking more time than I hoped to get it out to live servers.<P>I see a lot of posts saying how easy caster balance would be to do, or "here's one thing that would help us a lot and is quick to do!". Honestly, I wish that were true. I'd be very happy to have caster balance done and get on to the next improvements and additions to the game. <P>The fact is though, while small changes for each class are pretty obvious and easy to do, the bigger picture has to be maintained all the time. I've learned from the process so far that it's not good to release things bit by bit - the average player wants to know the big picture for each change as it happens. How does this change affect me? What do other classes get out of it? Will my class see more changes? Is caster balancing done now? I get these questions every day, and see them posted on community boards all over when any small change is made.<P>For example, we've got some plans to improve healing versatility for the priest classes. To do that correctly, all classes that can heal need to be looked at to see how they'll be impacted. Give one class a better heal and all the other healing classes look at how it affects them. The new heal spell may make perfect sense when looking at the class that got it, but any class that didn't get it has immediate concern about why they didn't also get it, how it makes them less wanted in a given situation, and how they now need something to make up for the other class getting a new heal. This means that before we can alter a single small part of healing, we need to have answers for players about the plans for healing across every class.<P>This gets more complex because no class has just one single ability. So, say (hypothetically) that we add a better heal to druids. Clerics are immediately concerned because druids are now healing better- what do clerics get? Wizards grow concerned because now not only can druids nuke pretty well, they also can heal even better than previously, making them a potentially better deal for a group or raid looking for members. No matter how small a change is, it causes ripples throughout the game, the player base, and all the community message boards. When it comes to class balancing, no change is really a small change.<P>So, on to the point - We're still working on caster balance, and intend to make the necessary improvements. We expect the additional changes to pets to be done soon, and then intend to focus on priests for a bit. We've been keeping up with the message boards and community feedback, so we've got a good handle on the concerns of various classes. Thanks for the continued interest and patience as we try to get this implemented in the best way possible.<P>Rich Waters<BR>Lead Designer, EverQuest <BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 05-23-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>So, what do you people think will happen?<P>I suspect Verant will try to make shaman and druids in particular better raid healers.<P>In return, they will make clerics a bit more versatile, probably by adding an util and a damage boost in one way or another. A good goal is probably to allow two clerics to be in a group and still be valuable to the group, and perhaps allow clerics some soloability.<P><P>------------------<BR>Mirixia, teir'dal templar<BR>Zarloth, teir'dal warlock<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Maybe to counterbalance the newfound flexibility of druids...<P>group CE wouldnt be such a pipe dream...I mean thats a heal that would be useful in most situations. To balance with shamans or druids maybe there could be a group chloroblast (make druids a weak substitute for cleric-impaired raids?)  Or a small torpor-esque group spell? /shrug.  <P>Giving clerics or even paladins a "blessing" type spell that can double as invis to undead and regular invis cant present a balance issue imo.Maybe that dream can come to fruition. It would probably remove the market for GVD's tho, or limit it to warriors...the economical repercussions would be greater than the class balance on this imo.<P>Cleric pet not poofing would be nice , and making it a higher level to justify the 600 mana per mob it costs to use on a raid.<P>Divine light being less mana couldnt hurt, its a nice support heal spell on raids, but the mana is damn near CH.  Also, has a spell ever had mana cost significantly reduced?  Im not sure this is a realistic idea, but I would certainly use DL more if it were less mana.<P>/shrug  Just my cp</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Maybe it is because I am at heart a cynic, but whenever I see the word change or balance, the old saying of "Be careful what you ask for, as it may just come true" rings in the back of my mind.  I really hate to see complete heal going to other priests.  Right now on raid situations we normally have one cleric per group, and those same clerics do set up the CH rotations.. but I would like to think those other priest classes are busy as well. either slowing, dotting, or even underhealing.    <P>Dusk 60th High Priest of Prexus  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Actually, what I'd like to see for the pet...<P>- Keep its melee ability as it is, i.e. pretty weak<P>- Keep its HP's as they are, i.e. poor, but continue to allow it to be buffed<P>- Reduce the casting cost to 250 mana<P>- Add 30-60 seconds grace period before it dies, giving you time to find a new target<P>Do that, and you have a pet which lets you kill greens without silly levels of downtime.  As it stands, we're about the only class that has this problem, which sucks for questing & tradeskilling.<P>Reduced mana costs might also make the pet a viable source of damage contribution to an XP group - as it stands today, nukes (especially with Judgement) are a lot more efficient.<BR><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=9807" TARGET=_blank>Morrun Catspaw</A><BR>High Priest of Bristlebane<BR>Albion - Death Before Dishonour!<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The single biggest improvement they could make for us is a way to "buff" offensive power. Its our obvious weakness. We need to either bring more to the table offensively ourselves or have a way to buff others to improve their offense. We are in a pit as far as utility goes as well so that also needs some work. <P>It looks like a foreshadowing to a large heal upgrade for Druids and Shaman to me. Watch the recast times and possible reagents, thats where we will see if its viable for Exp groups or not in all likelihood. <P>That said who knows what the hell VI has planned for the priest classes. My experience as a cleric looking over past expansions and "upogrades" is that we should be very afraid of what they will do.

</FONT><HR>If clerics are able to buff offense, they will be stepping on other class abilities, just like clerics are worried about having their healing abilities infringed upon.  Rangers in particular are known for attack buffs, and they use most of the spell attribute slots for that already.  That's considered by many rangers to be our main contribution to a raid currently, and you wouldn't be able to add an atk buff without having major stacking issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>There are already alot of shaman that hate healing in a group. Shaman don't really have a problem getting groups or getting into raids, and a complete heal for them would be hugely overpowering.

</FONT><HR>/nod Ferrell<P>And even MGB has a pretty bad downside to it, it's a one shot deal- You can have 2+ clerics at a raid with MGB and Gaego and only one of them will do anything with it.<P>I would like to suggest (if by any chance Rich Waters see's this) move Marzin's Mark off of HP and put it on the same mobs that drop Gaego or one step down.  Instead of Doomshade, MM could be on the DM's etc.  Think about it, one of the biggest gripes that Druids have is that PotG is not wanted because you dont get the symbol buff component with it, and the difference between Naltron Mark and Marzin is pretty significant.  350ish hp's I think.  Been awhile since I played my cleric sorry, numbers a bit fuzzy.  And do you think any raid is going to sit around and wait for clerics to individually Marzin 20 some odd casters when in one whack they can all be Gaego'd and be done with it?  Not gonna happen.  <P>So why provide a solution to this class dispute on buff's and then stick the solution on a mob that 1% of players are going to get to?  Thats self defeating.  The object of spell and mob placement needs to be a balance of Risk vs Reward and class interoperability.  Are you trying to cause tension between Druids and Clerics?  I dont think VI is, but if not, then move the Marzin Mark spell so that it's a lot more accessible so that /GASP  it gets used and make a whole lot of players happy.  <P>Think about it...<P>MGB Cleric - Takes all the melee's off to a corner and Gaego's   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>MGB Cleric - Takes all the casters off to a corner and MM's   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>MGB Druid - Goes with the casters and PotG.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>Everyone is happy!--<BR>Druids got to use their MGB skill (finally)<BR>Clerics got to use MGB (more than one per raid anyhow)<BR>Casters all got a good symbol buff + Druid buff of uberness<BR>Melee's got Gaego which is all they cared about in the first place.<P>How fricken hard is that????????????????<P><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964" TARGET=_blank>Grumbles</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ferrell, I hope someone at Verant see your post and makes note of it, you covered it all, accurately, in a pleasant, succint post.<P>I don't want to be "balanced" with better nukes or solo-ability, I play this class to heal and that's where I'd like my "balance", thank you.  Anyone looking to solo and/or nuke, there are classes based upon those premises, have at it.  (Before you do, know that those classes have had more profound and legitimate gripes for a longer period of time than clerics have).<P>I have never put up an "I agree" post in my life, but in Ferrell's case I was moved to create an account in order to do just that.  (Long time reader, but never had a reason to post).<P>...so while I'm at it, I'll also voice my agreement with Windeliane's post, (above, in this thread); our class has been relatively unmolested in terms of VI's "balance - stick".  Sure, there are legitimate concerns, but a lot of what I read on this board is either an overreaction to VI's latest sneeze or someone obsessing on their latest gripe -- all over a class that's in a position a lot of other class' players envy.  We're necessary in some situations, appreciated, adequately armed with the tools to do what we do -- (for the most part), and even fun -- (in relation to a lot of other class' roles on raids or otherwise).<P><BR>Jesper<BR>High Priestess<BR>Arch of Chaos<BR>Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well, I saw this coming. I am at the point where I really don't care what they do. There was a time when playing a cleric was a joy but, now well I still enjoy it but, somehow it just isn't the same. I love SOME of the AASP's and dislike most of them. Not worth my time really after I aquire the ones that are actually  useful. Two and three man teams for max exp is just boring and I actually wind up nuking most of the time. I still enjoy raids and a good jaunt in CT but other than that there are not really any zones left that allow one to be a cleric. Oallies and Necros have long since surpassed us in dealing with undead (what is going on there? Ummm we are clerics, ya know undead's worst nightmare. /sigh). <P>Bottom line, I don't care what they do anymore. They won't be seeing me in EQ 2.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Wow that last poster has never fought AoW before. I'm guessing he hasn't seen the high end game at all.<P>AoW is not slowable to my knowledge. I think Idol (the trigger mob) might be.<P>I don't think you can snare AoW. But there would be no reason to anyway...because he doesn't run and you don't kite him.<P>How would I balance preists?<P>Druids<BR>1. A better heal perhaps a spell for a 2k heal @ 350mana 10sec cast. (2200 with adept 3). Level 60. Could crit for 4k, and crit with adept for 4400 pt heal.<BR>I think after that they are pretty well balanced.<P>Clerics<BR>1. Clerics would get group CE.<BR>2. Clerics would get a class ability to improve heaing gift even further, such as wizards do with casting fury.<BR>3. Clerics would get defense to 220, dodge to 120, parry to 100. weapon skills to 200, and bash. Also the ability the get some more HP via perhaps an AA or just natural. Clerics were supossed to be the most melee intensive priest. I'm not saying you will see us melee in a gorup, but I damn well better be able to melee down a level 35 mob at level 60, I don't have freaking invis, damnit.<BR>4. Clerics will get a LOH ability in AA skills, perhaps to replace the utterly useless rez AA.<BR>5. We would get the improved root that wizards and druids get.<BR>6. celestial regeneration AA should either last longer, or heal more per tick. Frankly 2k heal evey couple hours over time for 5 or 6 aa is just...the suck. I want something I can use on a MT before the pull, something vastly better then CE.<BR>7. Bestow DA should grant a small heal, I can't use it on the tank because he loses all agro and it prevents others from healign him, and if I use it on a caster they are still low health agro. 500pt heal would be decent.<BR>8. Reduce periodot costs further. Perhaps make a peridot free Aegolism similar to emerald free avatar, rare drop spell in ST. Components are suck. Unless you want to penalize ALL classes on an hourly basis financially, then you need to ease up a bit. I know my enchanter doesn't use rune as much, mage CoH requires half as much and is used less oftem, necros, wizards..rarely use reagents. Tanks? BAH they don't use any reagents and they get all the loot that drops...they sell the old junk and keep the money!!!<P>ALL PREISTS<BR>1. Healing adept should give more of a bonus. 2, 5, 10 is worthless. Try 3, 8, 15.<P>ALL CASTERS<BR>1. ALL casters should get more for mental clarity points. 1 for level 1, 2 MORE for level 2, and 3 MORE for level 3. 6 points total...not 3.<BR>2. ALL casters need focus items relavent to thier skill set dating back to velious. Give them minor nuke focus items on the highest end velious armor gloves. And maybe speed casting on the arms. I'd say equiv to mage summoned or about that. Perhaps half the effect on the thurgadin and PoG armor.<P>Clerics/enchanters have no obtainable dmg dealing devices such as wizard rend robe/lure stick, mages chardok stick, velk noot boots. Druids kunark arms, velious bracer, epic. Shaman epic or jaundice bracer. Necro velk bracer, epic. They each have one WEAK item in VP, clerics have another item on an uber in ssra that is also weak. Not even obtainable by most, not anywhere near as powerful. These types of items are the staples of soloing. We need a new item added to the game for both classes. Prehaps via a quest.<P>Melee got 300% better weapons since original release. They got 100% more AC/HP. They can freaking solo now for exp in top end dungeaons. Good for them.<P>Casters got a 10% increase in mana efficency. That's all they got that mattered to them.<P>The mobs casters fight were upgraded to handle the new melee output. Approx 100% more HP.<P>There is a wide gap in the adjustments made...and while I do agree some of the changes were necessary, casters did kick butt next to melee back in Lguk....verant did go a bit overboard.<P>Rogues now do more damage then wizards, only they agro less, they don't run out of mana, and if they do agro..they are more likely to survive. That's overboard.

</FONT><HR><B>Druids<BR>1. A better heal perhaps a spell for a 2k heal @ 350mana 10sec cast. (2200 with adept 3). Level 60. Could crit for 4k, and crit with adept for 4400 pt heal.<BR>I think after that they are pretty well balanced.</B><BR> <BR>  Druids have basically become wizards at 60.  A bigger heal like this is pretty much needed though with mobs hitting for crazy amounts of damage.  NT/DL is really just joke damage and too inefficient.<BR> <BR>  This would still leave druids not really able to keep up with, or even come close to clerics as healers and at a raid you'd still be better ditching them for you cleric alt.  But again, they are pretty much wizards.  What wizards, druids and clerics (the 3 non pet classes) need is higher manaregen to power nukes and heals.  In an xp group the necro's pet will easily deal far more damage than the wizard/druid will when the night is over!<BR> <BR><B>Clerics<BR>1. Clerics would get group CE.<BR>2. Clerics would get a class ability to improve heaing gift even further, such as wizards do with casting fury.<BR>3. Clerics would get defense to 220, dodge to 120, parry to 100. weapon skills to 200, and bash. Also the ability the get some more HP via perhaps an AA or just natural. Clerics were supossed to be the most melee intensive priest. I'm not saying you will see us melee in a gorup, but I damn well better be able to melee down a level 35 mob at level 60, I don't have freaking invis, damnit.<BR>4. Clerics will get a LOH ability in AA skills, perhaps to replace the utterly useless rez AA.<BR>5. We would get the improved root that wizards and druids get.<BR>6. celestial regeneration AA should either last longer, or heal more per tick. Frankly 2k heal evey couple hours over time for 5 or 6 aa is just...the suck. I want something I can use on a MT before the pull, something vastly better then CE.<BR>7. Bestow DA should grant a small heal, I can't use it on the tank because he loses all agro and it prevents others from healign him, and if I use it on a caster they are still low health agro. 500pt heal would be decent.<BR>8. Reduce periodot costs further. Perhaps make a peridot free Aegolism similar to emerald free avatar, rare drop spell in ST. Components are suck. Unless you want to penalize ALL classes on an hourly basis financially, then you need to ease up a bit. I know my enchanter doesn't use rune as much, mage CoH requires half as much and is used less oftem, necros, wizards..rarely use reagents. Tanks? BAH they don't use any reagents and they get all the loot that drops...they sell the old junk and keep the money!!!</B><BR> <BR>  Generally good ideas.  3 really should be applied to all non melee classes who take horrific damage compared to meleers even with the same AC.  5... which do you want, the utterly useless druid one or the highly useful but only once per 72 minutes wizard one?

</FONT><HR>We do OK damage vs most mobs. So we have some minor solo'ing ability, I mean I can take out maybe 4 mobs in the grey before resting if I am on my horse, have KEI, BaotR, SCM3, MC1, judgement spell. Of course I have FT5 also...and 255wis +1025mana or so and high ac for a cleric so I don't heal myself much.<P>Still I find it very inefficent. All the other preists and casters are out there with pets doing thier damage mana free, click nuke devices, quad kiting, mana efficent nukes, even more efficent DoT's.<P>That's where we fall behind...lack of efficent damage dealing besides straight forward nukes.<P>FYI if you talking to me about Lguk and pre-kunark ratios...you can stop there...I have been hardcore since way before the game went public. I know all about cleric damage pre-release even. Such as the addition of furor (I feedback'd it a a couple times before they added it, 8dmg at level 13 was weak), or the nerfing of AE dmg (used to do more and larger radius). We also used to have a FUNCTIONAL lull spell. Now its just a joke (it was rarely resisted before, gave a failure message if it was, AND didn't agro on failure..ever).<P>1. I think our LIVE damage nuke is approx where it should be. And it will definately be adaquate if they put a mage nuke focus item effect on a peice of our armor (as well as all other casters armor, casters will remain balanced as is now with eachother...but gain ground on melee DPS)<P>2. I think our undead nukes are outdated.<BR>Judgement = 325mana --> 925 dmg (2.85)<BR>Exile Undead = 250mana -->725dmg (2.9)<BR>Is that really that much of a better ratio? 0.05? I mean can we really be called the true undead slayer? LOL. not.<P>Wizards 4.0 on ice spear, 4.44 on bane spells (situational like undead)<P>Mages are second best nukers..they have a 3.37 ratio at 60. <P>Verdict: Our undead nuke should be increased to 1000dmg for 310mana. 3.22 ratio. Why so close? It's not really. This is a situational nuke and it's less efficent then thier general nukes. It's more along the line of bane spells which is a FAR higher ratio, it's specific to undead. So a 3.22 ratio is rather conservative in comparision.<P>Plus wizards are specialized in evoc for another 8% mana savings. Plus they almost always have fury3 or higher...we have to focus on many other skills first. Wizards over level 34 or so have innate lower resists as well, and more resists to check against..fire, magic, cold...So in all actuallity the gap is still wider then it appears. If you factor all that in the ratio would be more like 3.22 vs undead...VS 5.0 vs all. Big difference.<P>I'm going to ask you a question now....how many undead mobs are in velious? Exactly. If our nukes are specialized so as to be hard to find an encounter in an entire expansion....then they should do a decent ratio.<P>3. I think our undead DoT's are too weak to even bother mem'ing. An undead DoT would mainly be used for solo'ing clerics because mobs in groups die too fast. And on raids...well we heal on raids.<P>4. I think we need something to use against MR mobs. MY melee is ZIPO, NADA..I have no pet to speak of. And all I got is MR nukes and heals...alot of times in icewell and such before raids...I sit at full mana. I can do nothing with it..and there is not enough healing needed (if they upped dmg output or HP any further the zone would be even more barren then now, in addition to cleric nuke immune they are also unslowable)<P>5. I think we need some sort of mana free damage, nothing spectacular, something that is less useful on groups or raids then it is when solo'ing. In our case all nukes are poor to use on raids, because we are expected to heal. But DoT's are definately less useful on raids.<P>300-350 dmg in 7-8secs would be a good click item. Preferrably found in a dungeon such as cazic or weaker....obtainable by all clerics just like druid epics etc are. Not a high end raid item. If it must be difficult to obtain a mob similar difficulty to velketor would be acceptable, provided he dropped several random loots for all classes, so that he was "desirable".<P>Speaking of which, I sure hope they have more dungeons like cazic in the near future. Quite frankly we have out grown dungeons such as velks, sebilis, karnors, acheva...ssra and cazic are the only real single group challange anymore. Ssra is slightly more difficult in some respects...and has crap for loot. Cazic is my idea of a near perfectly balanced high end skilled player exp/camp zone. Although at times I question just how good some of that loot is lol. But the same goes for the new smithed cultural armor...nice stuff is out for those who aren't in uber guilds these days.<BR>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20365" TARGET=_blank>Citra Dangermouse-60 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20357" TARGET=_blank>Venerable Pilsburry Dangermouse-60 CLR</A><BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>VEESHAN<p>[This message has been edited by Pilsburry (edited 05-27-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

The fact is referred to both in the instruction book and the Official Prima Guide to Everquest that game with my copy of Kunark (wuwu~) with the statement "They can also melee better than any other priest class". Further proof is in the actual offense cap, which is 25 more for shamans. <P>Not that I disagree with the spirit of your post. I say a dodge and defense boost is called for for all three priest classes, with a scale giving druids more dodge than shamans and clerics, clerics more defense than druids and shamans and shamans in the middle on both stats.<P>It boggles my mind that melee were given increased HP thrugh natural durability, but there is no caster archetype ability that increases the size of one's mana pool. On the same note, as a shaman, I can certainly say that I'd like to be able to spend AAs on buying up HP. It's certainly more worth my while than Mass Group Buff or Alchemy Mastery.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008618-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008618-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008618-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008618&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008618&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
