I trust him, but I forgot to ask:<br />
How do you get there? I know you have to get through Sirens and WW, but is that a safe trip? (safe as in I won't get squashed in 3 secs by some roamer)<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried to duo at the zone in, or just got some advise for a Necropolis newbie  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">04-25-2001, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's possible that you MIGHT be able to kill things at the zone in with one other person, but in my opinion, it's far more trouble than it's worth.<br />
<br />
To reach Dragon Necropolis we'll start in Cobalt Scar:<br />
<br />
1.  Cobalt Scar, you need Invis, SOW, and Endure Breath.  You swim to the Northern Cave and zone into Siren's Grotto hugging the LEFT wall (more on this in number 2).  Guarding Siren's Grotto are several Siren's that can see invis, dispell, and charm.  You're only hope is to find the zone line and keep going past them while they beat on you and pray they don't kill you.<br />
<br />
2. Siren's Grotto.  There are two ways through this zone.  The first way is to fight your way through which is extremely difficult.  The Second way is to use Druid Succor or the Wizard version which takes the party all the way to the other end of the dungeon.  Anyway, the reason you hugged the LEFT wall on zone in, is because there are about 3 very tough mobs at the entrance.  They will not aggro if you're above level 50 so long asyou hug the left wall.  They're very close to the zone and the 3 are packed tight.  Anyway, you somehow got to the end and zoned out.<br />
<br />
3. Western Wastes is the easy one so far.  Here you just need to worry about a bunch of high level mobs and Dragons (if you've destroyed your COV faction).  The nice thing is that only one or two of the dragons see invis.  Nothing else does.  Just make your way to the ravine and make your way to the back of it.  Slowly work down to the Portal (you can't miss it).  Touch the portal and you're inside.  Note that Levi, makes it easier to get down the ravine.<br />
<br />
4. You're now inside Dragon Necropolis.  Congrats.<br />
<br />
The zone in is guarded by Phase Spiders.  There are not many and you have a lot of room to work with.  They hit moderately hard and have the same annoying ability as Scarelings from Fear, they can randomly port people around the zone.<br />
<br />
Also, don't touch the bones scattered on the ground.  It will summon a horde of little spiderlings, summon Constructs, do DD, or dispell buffs.<br />
<br />
Getting to DN is the hard part and will be impossible for you and a tank partner.  The zone itself is very unforgiving.  If you screw up, it's a long and messy CR (the one time my guild wiped out here, we had to Necro Summon our corpses.  There was no other way).<br />
<br />
My advice, forget the partner idea.  It's just not worth it.  Instead get yourself a good solid group (including a Druid/Wizzy with the Succor Spell) and just camp the zone line.  You can make decent experience here, it's uncrowded, and some decent things CAN drop off of the spiders.<br />

The sirens at the hole to Sirens Grotto in Colbalt Scar do not see invis.  I have swam past them a billion times invised and never had an issue, but its possible I have been lucky. By the way, if invis pops you could have 200 mr and those green freaking sirens can still charm a lvl 60.  Talk about overpowered.<br />

<br />
Sirens CAN see invisbility but they don't always do so.  I know this for a fact since my first trip to Western Wastes, the Sirens saw me with invisibility on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaelem</div><div class="date">04-26-2001, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I've never had the Sirens outside SG see invis, and been by there numerous times =b<br />
<br />
Anyhow, getting through Siren's grotto without an in zone evac is a snap, I've done it with 2 invis potions and DA/DB, and with 3 folks fighting through.<br />
<br />
If you know the way, just invis past the 3 mobs near the zone, leap in the water, and DA/DB your way past the horses (can get unlucky with stuns though :\) and then invis past the rest of the mobs to the zone out.<br />
<br />
Fighting through, you need to kill 4 mobs. 4 seahorses to be exact. They have some hp, hit a lil hard, and kinda MR. Just bring a tank and slower and all is well.<br />
<br />
Some people have this vision that Sirens is a nasty zone. It's not really. Kinda annoying to get through without the evac, but definately not something to worry about. <br />
<br />
Hunting here can be rough, hehe, but passing through is no problem.<br />
<br />
Dragon Necropolis is a damn fun zone, IMO. <br />
I'd bring a group though. Make sure to bring a rogue to disarm traps, and a good enchanter if you plan on killing deep inside. I explored this zone without knowing anything about it, so was a LOT of fun. Died a few times, but there is something really cool about exploring something new, with no prior knowledge.<br />
<br />
Some nice drops there, I would recomend having high levels (56-60) if you plan on doing anything but the spiders, however.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">04-26-2001, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ditto on the Sirens outside SG and seeing invis: I've NEVER had that happen.  However, I rarely bother with invis anymore.  Yes, they can charm me, but it never lasts long, I resist everything else, and they've never taken more than a few hundred hit points.  Keep in mind I'm 60, so your own experience may vary (=P).<br />
<br />
Getting through SG is a snap for my SK; never tried it with Rayne, although I suspect I can do it (must invis past first three though since they will follow).  I do know that a 54 Druid gets whacked every time they try (same player as the 60 Monk, so he definitely knows how).  We're a lot sturdier than Druids, again, so your mileage may vary.  I recommend fighting some in SG before trying to sneak through so you have an idea of the vagaries of the zone.<br />
<br />
The WW part is easy, yet we almost always have someone get whacked.  Just seems to happen.  We're +CoV, but there are still plenty of things itching to kill you.<br />
<br />
Now inside DN.  Yes, the Phase Spiders can be done singly.  It's not worth the trouble.  Not only &quot;can&quot; they port you, they &quot;will&quot; port you, multiple times, every fight, and sometimes VERY FAR away.  Huge waste of time.  Plus they hit hard enough to notice.<br />
<br />
We do DN with 7-8 people a lot and while tough, it's doable.  I strongly recommend having an Enchanter AND Shaman along; slow is critical, mez nearly so, and mana regen/speed buffs also necessary.<br />
<br />
If I were going to DUO somewhere I would not pick DN.  Sentient Suits in WL would be blue and a lot easier to deal with.<br />

<br />
After that one time, I've made it just fine.  I guess that one time was a fluke but I know for a fact that one time they saw me.<br />

I guess I'll stay in WL or SolB for my duo, and head to DN when/if I can get a place in a group going there.</div></div><hr />

If you are willing to scrap your Thurgadin faction, dorfs at the icewell/Thurg A. zone make excellent Tank/Warrior duo mobs. Great exp and an occasional piece of RV (non-bp and legs) drops.<br />
<br />
Also, at 53 if you want to solo, a good spot is near the &quot;beehive&quot; in Burning Woods...you can use your banish line on the various hornets many of which will remain blue for you through 54.<br />
<br />
There is also a single static spawn blue skelly at the extreme western tip of the Combine City in Autumn Valley in Dread Lands.<br />
I can't remember how much exp this spawn gives but it *used* to be about 5 min spawn if I remember correctly and easy to kill with a few root/undead nukes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">04-30-2001, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Going further on this thread, my guild took a solid stab at Dragon Necropolis over the weekend and we stayed for a good 6 hours or so.  We took 3 groups here and just had an amazing time killing Rats, Bats, Spiders, and Snakes (ahhhh, just like the old Freeport Newbie zone...).<br />
<br />
We had a couple of hairy situations but we never wiped out and our worst fight only left us with 2 or 3 dead.<br />
<br />
Rogues make this zone SO much easier with their ability to disarm traps.  We were able to move through the zone at will (though we did spring a few of the Dragon Construct traps just for the fun of it).  The drops were decent, we got a ton of gems, spells, and a few weapons including 2 of these insane 2HB Caster weapons with a billions stats/saves on it.<br />
<br />
Experience was amazing.  I made 3 blue bubbles at level 52 while here.  Loot was great and it was a fun zone.<br />
<br />
Tips:<br />
1.  Bring a Rogue!<br />
2.  Come prepared with Fish Scales, Bat Wings, Peridots and all other caster components.  You'll use it all at one time or another  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
3.  A level 59 Chanter was NOT able to mez everything.  Some of the rats were mez proof.<br />
4.  If you wipe out, CR is a pain in the butt.  Unless you have a secondary raid force handy, you're going to need Coffins and a Necro.<br />
5.  Go in and have fun.  This is a zone that not everyone will get to see.  Enjoy it.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">05-02-2001, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bard is a fine substitute for a rogue in DN... fine substitute for an enchanter as well, and in fact can do both jobs just peachy. This is not a tightly packed dungeon.<br />
<br />
XP there is fantastic, but when I go I am in 56+ groups exclusively. Pre-55 you are worse than useless, you are a liability. Don't try it without a superb tank and some strong damage dealers. I saw common mobs that were level 58.<br />
<br />
Have an AE memmed, and try to bring a wizard and magician with you as well. There are traps that spring swarms of level 50ish mobs that have low HP. A couple of AEs and you wipe them out and get xp for them all =) Even Upheaval was worth it here.<br />
<br />
Unstunnable wandering gaters suck btw.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perplex Cerebrum</div><div class="date">05-03-2001, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a question about the rogue part.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I have never played one, and I've been to DN about half a dozen times now. I've had a rogue in group a few times and he has problems disarming traps. Specifically, he didn't know where they were and sense traps apparently didn't detect them.<br />
<br />
So, how does this work? If a rogue can disarm any trap in there, it would make our lives much easier. There is one particular trap I have grown to dislike with passion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jassie</div><div class="date">05-03-2001, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont think beetle traps can be disarmed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KamuelaTZ</div><div class="date">05-03-2001, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know about a duo doing well there.<br />
<br />
I did the zone in with a 59 rogue and shaman. A warrior, cleric, and either shaman or enchanter would do quite well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">05-08-2001, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a GREAT discussion on Dragon Necropolis on eqdruids (www.eqdruids.com) message board.  Includes maps, travel-there instructions, details on killing those seahorses in SG, tips on disarming the traps in DN (their conclusion is dont disarm the beetles- but read the thread to see why), areas inside to hunt. <br />
<br />
It is in the message board, under &quot;velious&quot;.  It is of course from a druid perspective, but lots of good tips, IMHO.<br />
