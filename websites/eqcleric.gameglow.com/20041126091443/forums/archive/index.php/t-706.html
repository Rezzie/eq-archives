<br />
But it seems like clerics sometimes feel that pallies at 60 become clerics with tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
Sure a pally at 60 can do a 90% res and buffs with with reso/sh of words. But between the lack of mana, lack of time to med (cause they're tanking), they have no hope of being the group healer even with superior. Hell my shaman has superior and I kill myself trying to keep a warrior healed.<br />
<br />
And as for the DW helm....fact is that the cleric arms post nerf are as good as the DW helm pre nerf....<br />

Infringed upon a bit? Yes.<br />

Lack of equal infringement on our part upon others: Yes.<br />
<br />
What does that boil down to:<br />
<br />
Many people got much of our bread &amp; butter. We got some fancy whipped butter. Yes fancy whipped butter was a tad nicer than the old butter.<br />
<br />
I aint going to post on whineplay about it, but It would have been nice say for instance a Paladin gets one of our 2 most defining spells (49 XP res) that we got one of someone elses defining spells/abilities , oh say LOH at 60?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Well in all honesty I think class abilities should be shared more rather than less. As a shaman I  am already used to this of course, at 51+ chanters can slow almost as well as us, mages can malosi, necroes got our dots etc. We got infringed upon a lot more than you ever will.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think one problem at high levels is people are waiting for the cleric and enchanter to log on before they can tackle hard dungeons....<br />
<br />
If more classes shared abilities like mezzing/ressing networking and organizing groups for hours so you can do let's say chardok, then having to call it off cause the cleric has to log...is not fun.<br />

Infringed upon http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif thank you. It's not that we aren't tanks or DD experts, it was that other classes got our abilities, and granted they might not be as equal as our best spells but it still doesn't sit right. I am not worried about being replaced because clerics will never be replaced (unless verrant really screws up) but if pallies got our res why didn't we get LOH or better tanking or a Flaming Mace quest or anything? Although now with Donal's armour we have recieved a nice little thing to look forward to at high levels. I'm not expecting to actually get anything changed about the cleric I'm just trying to make a point and get some discussion about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friday</div><div class="date">07-28-2000, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would you want a flaming mace? Would you honestly tank? I know some shamans tank a lot with the barb spiritist hammer/nuker bracer but even if I had these items I would never use them except when soloing (ie never)<br />
In a group our role as support casters is to buff/ debuff/ back up heal (as shamans) imo.<br />
<br />
as for loh....well how about complete heal? A slowed mob, a tank with over 2500 hp at 1.5 bubbles.... you know the drill better than me hehe. Why do you want an LOH every 72 minutes when you can cast something as good for 400 mana  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I just wish Verant would do something to make PLAYING a cleric more fun.  No balance upseting adjustments, just some little things that allow us to have fun while we sit on our derriers and med.  <br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Reduce the mana cost on our hammer pet so we can actually afford to cast it (150-200 mana seems about right).  Give us a lower damage version of this spell at level 44.  Face it the tiny amount of damage done by this hammer pet is hardly an unbalancing factor.<br />
<br />
Give us self only invisibility and night vision spells (humans and erudites are blind as a bat at night).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it will be nice when more pallys hit 60, then they can share the burden of resurrection  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif They still cannot heal like a cleric, so they are not really infringing upon us in anyway. By the time pallys are hitting 60, clerics are 56+ with the 96% xp res. In the 51+ level range, that 6% makes a world of difference. <br />

That's about as far as it goes for them though.<br />

On the other hand, I am really disappointed with how the scope of a cleric is getting narrower and narrower with the 50+ levels.<br />

I fully realize our role but man...what I wouldn't give for a utility spell or three. :P<br />

Seriously how many of you would group with a pally if a warrior of the same level was available.  Giveing pallies res means that they become a usefull part of a group, and secondly how many of you clerics have died in a group and had a pally as the only one left alive that could get you back in, and therefore eaten the exp loss and taken a revive from him (mostly pre kunark).  I for one have been revived back into a room 3 times, eating the exp loss so the group didn't need to evac out and fight back in to my body so I could res it myself.  Class envy sucks, especially coming from clerics who have to know that we are the single most looked for class for any group.  How many of you get tells, or guildsays as soon as you log on asking for you to come to some location and group?  Ask the pallies how many times they get the same.  Clerics are, and always will be the only class that every group needs from around 45th level and up.  True enchanters make groups more effective, and allow fighting in tougher areas, but without a cleric exp is DAMN hard to get in any kind of a steady way.  If I want a group I can almost always find one within 20 min of logging on, and even if I don't want a group I get tells constantly asking me if I'm looking for one.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is Pallies will never replace clerics, let them have some abilities that have been cleric only to give them more of a use to the rest of Norath.<br />

Now I do not play a Cleric and dont pretend to know what you all go through, but I have played fantasy games (AD&amp;D and such) in past and wanted to add a comment or two.<br />
<br />
First about clerics getting LH.  Paladins were always supposed to be &quot;pure good&quot; in most games.  Therefore, they were given some powers, LH being one, and a Protection from Evil type effect.  This was because a Paladin could be nothing but good, or their god would take away their powers and make them lowly warriors.<br />
<br />
That being said, there have always been EVIL clerics. Being evil, they really would not benefit from a Protection from Evil effect, nor would they get LH because they are not pure good. In EQ terms, would the Dark Elf clerics then have to get Harm Touch?<br />
<br />
Also, about Paladins getting some of your abilities and the rez spell.  Paladins are supposed to be like 75%warrior and 25%cleric or so, right?  So, how is it wrong that they get a rez spell?  And how are they infringing upon you, if they are part of you?<br />
<br />
Just to close it out, from an rp point of view, (RP? what's that???) dont forget about your DE brothers when you make your suggestions and comparasins between clerics and pally's.  Clerics CAN be evil, Pally's cannot.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Interesting note there.<br />
<br />
Lets do the math.<br />
<br />
Max Cleric level 60 divided by 25% = 15<br />
<br />
So by that argument a Paladin should get up to 15th level clerical spells.<br />
<br />
That argument would highly preclude our 49th res.<br />
<br />
Paladin at level 60 is 75% warrior and 80% cleric. <br />
<br />
Yes I know that is more than 100%<br />
<br />
And THAT is the problem that the verbal Clerics are complaining about. <br />
<br />
And to help any who would care to flame me, please read my intial post on this thread, my personal opinion on the matter is stressed in that post. This reply is a simple cross-argumentation to what 'seemed' like a logical and fair argument on the paladin's in questions part.<br />

<br />
There is just one problem with the math thing, as I understand it, lvls 50-60 are supposed to be like going 1-50.  That is where the problem exists.  A lvl 60 anything should be considerably more powerful then a lvl 50 anything else.  <br />
<br />
Casters get new powerful spells every lvl, mellee's get diciplines and double backstabb, triple attack at some lvl's.  Hybrids get some of your past spells that from lvl 1-50 were extremly powerful, but at 60 are not as powerful compared to what either of their parent classes get.<br />
<br />
I think one of the problems here is the comparing of a 57-60 paladin to a 50 or so cleric and thinking it is the same as 47-40.  The whole post 50 game is so much more different then the pre 50 game, and comparing the two is very difficult.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not feel that 60 cleric is like an effective 50 levels different than a 49 cleric. Nor any other class for that matter, do you?<br />
<br />
Now the experience required is certainly like that, but the skill gains, power increases etc are definitely nothing like that to be sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Friday</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess here are my thoughts on the matter..<br />
<br />
At high levels (51+), where it's all about grouping I think clerics, enchanters and true tanks: warriors, rogues and monks are the most powerful classes/contribute most to groups.<br />
<br />
Pet casters don't contribute as much as the above unless it's  call of the hero (mage) or summon corpse(necro). (yeah their pets are nice too but pathing usually isn't as kind)<br />
<br />
Wizards provide an important role as taxi/evac but their dd's compared to the 1000's and 1000's of hp's of mobs isn't significant.<br />
<br />
Druids/Shamans are generalists and though they make small groups shine, high level dungeons require balanced groups, reducing the need for them.<br />
<br />
Hybrids like ranger/sk/pally/bard all have a nice mixture of skills but again contribute little to well balanced groups and have a hard time getting groups at all 40+.<br />
<br />
<br />
So there is is the class interdependence going on that Verant loves but at high levels it's more of a dependence on clerics, chanters and true tanks than an interdependence.<br />
<br />
To balance this perhaps one can safely say at low levels who would want a cleric when you can a druid/shaman that can heal as well and add  many other abilities to the group.<br />
<br />
Likewise hybrid tanks at low levels bring a lot more to the group than say a warrior.../shudder<br />
<br />
Anyway I don't think you guys should feel threatened by pallies (though most of you clearly don't-thanks for your replies).<br />
For those that do, remember that most pallies will have problems getting groups  at high levels, while clerics never will, whether pallies can res or not, discipline tanks unfortunately just add more to groups.<br />
<br />
Luckily and hopefully you develop friendships in game that looks beyond class details and xp hogging by the hybrids  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

In my guild we only have 2 or 3 pure warriors.  Of those only 1 is above 50.  We have 3 paladins all 53 or higher.  When doing hunts and stuff, I find that paladins are sufficient in their ability to tank.  They have decent AC, and decent HP and enough tools at their disposal to keep the mobs taunted off me.  Stuns, taunt, bash etc etc.  Plus they can top themselves off with heals after the fight.<br />

Considering that they have to pay a significant experience penalty to reach level 60 in the first place, they deserve a little perk.  <br />
<br />
A cleric has to meditate a significant amount of time to have enough mana to perform as a healer.  A pally would have to sacrifice tanking to act as a healer.  <br />
<br />
At higher levels against tougher mobs, superior heal is only useful on casters.  Tanks have far to many HPs to make anything short of complete heal mana efficient.</div></div><hr />

They fight well, tank well and can heal themselves after fights.  The Pally I routinely group with heals me first (while I med) then tops off everyone else, then meds.  He always LOH's himself or anyone else in the group who needs it.  He never complains when I cast DA right before he LOH's me and always tells me he is going to touch someone (except me) right before he does it (to help conserve my mana).  I will take the exp penalty any time because he is so much fun to group with.  By the way, he is ALWAYS the last one to run or zone.  <br />
<br />
I am glad they get rez (I certainly would not begrudge a pally giving either me or anyone else an exp rez).<br />
<br />
The Deepwater Helm issue has been talked to death.  At some point, who (besides Pallys) should care what they get, and certainly, it is very petty to begrudge them the things they get.  They do get an exp penalty, which we share when we group with them, but we get to be clerics all the time and they get the exp penalty all the time.</div></div><hr />
