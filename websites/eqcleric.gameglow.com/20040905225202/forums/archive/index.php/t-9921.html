<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LadyCat</div><div class="date">02-06-2001, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the last month I've been surfing the EQ Gameplay forum of Everquest when I need a break from work.<br />
<br />
Every day I see one or more threads bashing the 'uber' cleric.  I'm so afraid that if this keeps up we will get hit badly with the nerf stick during the 'final balancing'.<br />
<br />
I enjoy my cleric - primarily because I have a druid on tap for invis/sow/ports (my husband who always plays when I do). I shudder to think what the clerics without a druid on tap go through for travelling. <br />
<br />
I have my husband to hunt with as well as a small guild of good friends and they don't burst a blood vessel if I do things other than heal - they trust me to know when I can afford the mana to do that, and when I can't.<br />
<br />
But more and more seeing the hostility on the board towards clerics, I really wonder if I should bother being the nice cleric that goes to the dungeon to help a failed raid rez 13+ characters and doesn't ask for compensation.  Why bother?  Apparently we are all 'greedy uber whiners' that need to be nerfed because we are 'hogging' a group spot. Yeah, right. Whatever.    <br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm there to play too, not to be someones rez stick.  My hubby and friends appreciate me, just as I appreciate them for their abilities (both as characters and players).  I wish all clerics had the support group I have.  I know not everyone does.<br />

<br />
The thing is, I'm pretty sure they avoid flame topics.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think this change they did on test is the only change that's gonna happen (i.e. there's nothing coming for clerics).  I'm basing this mostly on the fact that they mentioned that Feb. 9 deadline which is coming up fast.  In any case, I might be wrong. <br />
<br />
I don't want to get into arguments over whether the dru/shm healing upgrade is good or not, and whether clerics should get some added benefits or not, so I'm not posting my views, and will just read.  At this point it's all been said and done, and it's getting boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirriana_00</div><div class="date">02-08-2001, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's very simple.  If you make a game where a healer is required for a group, people will want to get the best healer possible, to maximize their xp.  Currently this is hands down a cleric.  I would say that pulls in half the camps in Seb would have to be cut in half if there were a druid instead of a cleric healing.  And that is even counting a shaman slowing.  There is a requirement for clerics to be in a high level group, and the shaman and druid resent that, especially when they could be the healers until 45th-ish.<br />
<br />
Conversely, if you make a game around the fact that you don't need a healer, why would anyone ever play a cleric?  If they do nothing to speed up the rate at which mobs are killed or the rate at which downtime is reduced, there is no reason for them.<br />
<br />
VI's answer is to improve druids/shaman to be able to closely match cleric healing, but then you have cleric losing out on 90% of possible utility spells while only having a 20% increase in healing spells.<br />
<br />
There is also the thing about rezs.  As Abashi or Brad once said, it is expected that you can get a rez when you are high level.  Whenever a player can't get a rez, they blame us clerics for not being at their beck and call.  Given the xp it takes to get post 50, I know I would be mad when I ate a death in 54.  That anger has nowhere to go except on clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">02-11-2001, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the post-50 game, druids and shaman are having trouble getting groups, particularly for events/raids.  Partly this is because druids and shaman are very numerous in the post-50 game, and partly because the game post-50 is geared toward unresistable wizard lure damage, melee damage, and healing. <br />
<br />
Druids and shaman preferred, for most of their career, to be nukers/dotters, and thus specialized in evocation, generally.  When they got superior heal at level 53, it wasn't very useful to them as a way to remain viable in the post-50 raid environment. The high resistance levels of the Velious MOBs made their nukes/dots/slows very unreliable.  So they started to complain.<br />
<br />
Weirdly, they did not complain much about the resistance problems that put them out of the nuke/dot/slow business, but instead started complaining about their poor healing ability.<br />
<br />
I think they figured that Verant was not likely to retool the high level MOBs to make them less resistant, so they focused on healing as their ticket back into the big time.<br />
<br />
They claimed that they'd always been healers (true, but by no means was it their preferred or main focus pre-50).  They claimed that improving their direct healing ability would keep groups going in the absence of a cleric, while at the same time telling the whopper that filling in for a cleric did not mean completely replace.  They ignored the fact that in the pre-50 game druids and shaman were more desired in groups than clerics, if the healing power was roughly equal.  They especially tried to present the argument in a vacuum, comparing healing power only, as if they had no other damage-reducing or damage-avoiding abilities.<br />
<br />
Principally, they claimed that there was a cleric shortage, and by weird logic they insisted that beefing up their healing power would solve this problem -- even though it was pointed out to them over and over that their solution would probably result in fewer clerics, not more.<br />
<br />
They howled, b*tched, whined, and moaned until Verant caved.  And they had the nerve while they were doing this to call clerics  selfish whiners for attempting to preserve our principal identity as primary healers.<br />
<br />
I only wish I could speak with the people making the class balance decisions at Verant face to face to find out what they are thinking and why they found the druids' and shaman arguments convincing.  Also, I would ask why Verant continues to ignore the clerics' many requests for changes that would make the class more fun to play and thus more numerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ostrogoth Legionslayer</div><div class="date">02-12-2001, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been seeing a lot of cleric bashing in game as well as online.  Mostly what I have seen though is what happens when people fail to explain WHY they are doing something.  For instance:<br />
The other day I was hearing some guy complain in OOC about this &quot;really stuck up&quot; cleric who refused to res him.  So I asked why the cleric refused to res him.  He had blown the first one the cleric had given him because he wanted to continue to buy supplies in town and could not understand why the cleric would not give him another. All of a sudden all the clerics in zone start tralking about mana costs and how much of the cleric's time it takes to remed from a Res, etc. Shut him up pretty quick, especially when the other casters in zone got involved in the mana cost vs. spell worth discussion. But I am not sure the &quot;really stuck up&quot; cleric told him that, think he just said &quot;No, I will not res you&quot;.  In this case a little explination went a long way. Telling people why makes the blow a little easier.  Like telling people &quot;I am sorry I am in a group and can not leave&quot; is accepted by most people as a valid reason not to res.  Just my two cents I guess.<br />

<br />
IMHO, the only reason that Verant ignored us, is we cleric howled, whined and moaned not loudly enough.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is time to press Verant more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alle</div><div class="date">02-26-2001, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you Darkbringer.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease.  Part of the problem is that druids and shaman are much easier to play and thus much more popular classes than clerics are.  They easily outnumber clerics 5 to 1 (if not more).  There will never be enough clerics to get Verant's attention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylune oberon'X</div><div class="date">03-01-2001, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ooooooooooooo so many of my thoughts and I didnt type them. I agree with much. Yeah if we bitched and moaned loud enough maybe they would listen, but who knows? As to the comment Ost made on explaining why you wont res someone. Dun take this the wrong way man, but no is no. I pay the 10pp a month to play this game, I hold the PW key, and I leveled the cleric. We have a wonderful abilitiy to res folks and get them, in some cases, hours of their RL back in the form of xps. This however does NOT make us the traveling res, nor should we be expected to drop everything cause someone lost half a bub of xps. You make a good point of saying to just explain yerself alittle and folks wont get so upset, but I believe sorry, bust atm should be explanation enough. Which is why I have had a bunch of folks end up on /ignore. I dun appreciate tells that go along the lines of where are you? to those I simply respond why? and what do I get in return? well I need a res. Plain and simple the people who whine about the stuck up clerics are the /rudest folks when it comes to asking for one (if they even have the common decency to ask) I have been asked to leave hate, seb, chardok, and many other places by people I dont know when they are 2 zones from their body and I am an entire continent away. travel with /roleplay on u say? IMHO I shouldnt have to. I spent long hours and a good chunk of my RL lvling my cleric and I am proud to display I am a Templar of Tunare. Instead how bout the folks asking for resses having common decency? busy atm should be all I have to say. I should not have to, and will not explain why I say no to anyone. 1 other point...ever notice that the most /rude folks are the ones who when grouped get mad if a cleric does an out of group res? I am not posting this to start a debate, but to give my opinion an maybe just maybe some non-clerical PC's will see this and realize, we arent just stuck up, but sometimes we really are busy atm.<br />

<br />
Guess we don't have to worry about this one anymore.  Yea or nay with the new format?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldmoon</div><div class="date">04-10-2001, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so true : perhaps clerics do not complain cause the people playing them are not the same as most of drood player 12 year old.<br />
<br />
perhaps i am too direct but as a matter of fact who ks who complain ?</div></div><hr />
