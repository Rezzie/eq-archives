<br />
I dislike dungeons greatly, being a casual player.  I can't afford to have an evening's time wasted by dying, so I try now to keep tragedies to an absolute minimum.  It is getting easier to survive now, fortunately, thanks to Alt Spec making it easier to gate out of trouble, and two invulnerability spells, and stronger buffs, and the more powerful spells possessed by groupmates, etc.<br />
But there is still one way for me to suffer close shave after close shave, and that is in dungeons while in pickup teams.  In dungeons the experience can come faster, but it can go right back out the window because of incompetence (no matter how competent the individuals are, it is still a team of strangers), trains, overeager pullers, lag, and whatnot.  So I stay out of dungeons, and my survival has been almost assured.  Outdoors hunting is far more forgiving than dungeon play.  What I need most are suggestions for outdoor areas to hunt, preferably in groups.  Here are some that are still viable at level 35, but are not reliable for one reason or another:<br />
1) Icy Orcs in Permafrost (camped by mid-twenties people most of the time who don't want a mid-thirty cleric).<br />
2) Ogre shrine in West Karana (hard to find anyone camping there at all, which means no hunting for me either).<br />
3) Splitpaw Gnolls (same problem as Icy Orcs).<br />
4) Cyclopses in Rathe Mountains (same problem as Icy Orcs).<br />
5) Gnome Guards in Steamfont (either camped by a couple of kiting druids or no one).<br />
6) Spectres in Oasis or Feerrott (haven't tried this yet).<br />
<br />
Your suggestions will be deeply appreciated.</div></div><hr />

From 34-35 I did a lot of outdoor hunting. West Commonlands was a good spot for the occaisional Hill Giant, Nightfall Giant, Griffon, or Dragoon Zytle. Superior Heal will allow you to easily take these down in a trio, while the respawn is spaced far enough to recover mana between fights.<br />
