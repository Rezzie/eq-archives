<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corish-MT</div><div class="date">01-22-2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing the High Keep route since around level 19 (I'm now 28), with the odd trip elsewhere every so often.  The downside to HK is that you'd better buy your spells and put them in the bank ahead of time since a cleric guild is a few zones away.  My level 29 spells are now sitting in the bank for when I finish off the next 4 yellow bubbles.<br />
<br />
I spent levels 19-25 in the Guard Room group (after level 22/24 you should be able to handle 4 mob pulls without getting anyone killed, along with the odd warrior).  At level 19, the guard room is all red con mobs, so make sure you have a tank that can take the damage (your primary tank should be at least 21, or at least have a very high AC).  Pulls will be anything from the guard room or lookout room.  As long as you're only symboling your main tanks, yourself, and your enchanter you should clear 2-8 plat per hour (or at least break even for the day so long as a Master Loot system is being used).<br />
<br />
At 25, if you have a large wisdom pool and have a high enough AC, you could do primary healer duty down in the warrior room (pulling warriors and raiders) as long as you have a good pair of tanks and a backup healer.  This gets rapidly easier as you approach level 28 (my only death was at level 27 due to a bad pull where I gained aggro intentionally in order to throw heals on the main tank).  Loot is better in the Warrior room.  Even with symbols, I cleared around 10-15 plat per hour, and the experience was sweet (1 yellow per hour in a good group).<br />
<br />
You'll definitely want an enchanter, or be very good at managing aggro in a confined space in the warrior room.  (Celestial Remedy and Bravery are good primary heals, saving Greater Healing for desperate situations or after fight heals.)  <br />
<br />
Some people will tell you to heal your party from upstairs (yes, you can heal through the floor, using the F# keys to target your party), but frankly, you're only doing yourself a disservice if you're not learning the art of aggro management.  (And clerics are allowed to wear plate armor for a reason.) <br />
