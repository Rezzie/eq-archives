The warrior room (HHK) was not full?? <br />
On Bristlebane, usually all 3 rooms are full with waiting lists from about 9am-3am est. <br />
Cazic is usually great (For me), not too crowded, but not too empty to start a group. <br />
Do you usually play during non-peak hours? If so, some of the places such as South Karana may be an option. <br />

Hmm.. <br />
Couple suggestions: <br />
1) Find a druid to hunt with you and your warrior. Their harmony is EXCELLENT for busting up spawn. No joke. Our calm line helps, but their harmony line is so damned good Try to get this druid to be part of your regular team if you can, you and the warrior keeping stuff off the druid, druid doing dots/snares/backup heals... It really helps alot. <br />
2) How about trying runnyeye? I know the bottom of runnyeye used to get me wailed on until I was 30, and even then I've gotten mobbed. Find one or two spawn you can pull steadily. <br />
3) Unrest is good. I would've loved this place if it wasn't so trainy at your level. I've come to love it by the time I was 28 and floating around in the basement  If you need hints on this, ask. Clerics can solo in the halls. Don't go in rooms without a solid group though. Hide your warrior friend in a closet with IVU, and go bring him toys to break <br />

I found that I HATED unrest at any and all levels! You go negative on experience if you even try to help or heal a group member. Too many trains and that nonsense. <br />
I however just reached level 28 all because of a little place called Rathe Mountains. I gained three levels there in THREE DAYS! <br />
Best of luck to you!<br />

I have to agree that Rathe should be your best shot. But 26 is the low end of the cyclops spectrum (cycs are about level 32). First off, with Root and Dismiss you can solo (yes, you heard me. I used the 4 letter s word in a cleric forum ) Giant Skeletons. Another option is to camp a necro tower (Findlegrob's is closest to the Lake zone). Many low blue and green critters plus the necro himself and his pet. Once you've broken the spawn (one good calm/harmony pull should do the trick) it's relatively easy to camp and you have the right tools since they're all undead (except the necro. hafta have a semi-decent tank for him). Cyclops don't become easy unless you have a group of high 20s/low 30s and a couple of them be decent tanks (keep in mind that Wrath at 29 does around 200 damage). <br />
CT is only good for high 20s up through about lvl 38 or so (it's GREAT exp to get you out of 30 and 35 fast). The Courtyard is nice to hunt at the mid 20 level but it's also train central and you can die fast. Your best bet for constant exp, tho, is the grid (NOT the AoF group. Grid is spearate unless someone in AoF is anal) or the Lower Throne Room(LTR). UTR might be a bit high for you at this point. <br />
Another option (surprised it's unmetioned so far) is to camp the guards outside Splitpaw in SK. They're high red but very doable with a cleric  and some tanks and a caster or 2. Very good (and constant) exp. I'd recommend the front areas of Paw as well, but they are trained often as well and to be honest you really need to be 30+ to have a shot at survival in there. <br />
Hope that helps. <br />

Is there a particular spot that is best for the giant skellies? <br />
Also- on Brell, outside paw is camped by low 30's lately. Many weeks ago (well, maybe not, but seems like it) I was in an outside paw group. But since then- these low 30 people have been there. <br />

Good spot for you in rathe is the undead ruins where the giant darkbone for our caduceous spawns. That area is far away from hg's and cyclops and is pretty safe exp. You'll have to clear out some green undead but that area spawns monks, barbed bones and giant skeles pretty often. Oh and NEVER EVER use aoe spells there... there's a roaming high level necro that happens to wander right by there while you're not looking ;p and he can really kick some serious ass. <br />
Best place for giant skeles is the cyclops areas (hg area spawns quite a bit of them as well but a bit too dangerous at your level), just stay to the outside rim till you see one and pull it back to you. Remember roaming bears are ph for cyclops, lizards for gskels and basks for hg's and cycs i think. <br />

If that is true why does everyone kill the giant skellies thinking there PH for the Cyclops? <br />
There are like 30ish+ PCs killing giant skellies that are white, yellow and red to me at 24... <br />
its just a pain, they smack them down before I can even get a chance... and I hate to try and KS it. <br />
Sorry if this was seen as a rant.. <br />

<br />
We saw the necro when we were there. He lingered around. It was our understanding that if we attacked the undead, he would attack us. <br />
Where is the cyclops area? It's not listed on my map(source: eqatlas) :P <br />

They might be, but I remember from my limited (read: 30minutes) testing that when I killed giant skels it would either spawn another giant skel or a lizard. Same thing with bears and cyclops. Although the giant skels in the hg area might be ph's for cyclops either way everything in that zone is probably a ph for something heh. <br />
Suesc - cyclops area is the little circle valley you hit right when you zone in from lake rathe.<br />

26 is a difficult level because many of the camps in the world are lvl 25-30 and as you no doubt have figured out blues are alot better than whites yellows and reds for exp. <br />
I'd forget cyclops for a start...im not a great fan of doing cyclops or giants for exp...why? because they take such effort to down and there are so few of them that you just can not get good experience of them. <br />
What you need is a static spawn...preferably one which is easy. Why? because ya dont want to die. There are certain key areas in the game that with a bit of practice you can easily not die. I managed to go for around 6-7 levels without dying more than once. I managed to maintain a similar record with my paladin between lvl 20 and 31. <br />
The key spawn in my opinion for this is the icy orc spawn in everfrost. <br />
It is a bunch of 5 mobs. 4 of which are lvl 25 or so orcs with a lvl27 sk orc called redwind. It is outside so harmony works a treat. <br />
You need a druid or a ranger to effectively get experience. A few tanks and you are sorted for the full spawn. At 26 you will need a good group to stop from dying. Soloing the orcs is not a good idea (ie someone else is harmonying but doesnt want to group so you single pull) as it can turn sour. <br />
Once you have the spawn broken (might take a while) and provided you have a powerful enough group you can pull them on spawn (which is alot safer than harmony as it dont help when a mob spawns mid pull and believe me this can happen). <br />
There are many key tactics here. <br />
One of the best I had was with me 2 druids and 2 shamans. Druid 1 snares, shaman 1 malaise, I fear, then druid 2 uses highest dot , druid 1 uses the lesser, same for shamans. I also nuke it once or twice (once if ya got wrath). I can guarantee that unless its a complete burn out fear related (ie it runs off and breaks within 5 seconds) it will be dead by the time it comes back. <br />
I have had an orc stroll all the way back after fear broke come upto me ...root me and then turn away as his hitpoints put him into the zone where they run with snare on. Was very happy. <br />
Got tanks...aint got harmony?..Pull with fear. Let the tanks taunt them off ya and then fear all but one. <br />
As they return fear them. I have managed to pull 3 and reduce the fight to a series of 3 on 1 fights (our favour) with fear. <br />
Use these tactics and you can get to 36 from this one spawn alone. As you go up in level the danger reduces (very difficult to die here at 29 up) but the number of people you need in a group also reduces. <br />

I generally consider the &quot;bubble&quot; next to the lake zone to be the cyclops area as only GS, and cycs spawn. <br />
Lizardmen and GS are indeed PH for the cycs (except those by the necro tower) and HGs in the HG area. Bears are not PH. I'm sure if you asked the groups nearby to let you have the GS spawns they would as they stop giving exp around level 32 or so. <br />
As far as Paw goes, I never said it would be easy to get a spot. It is quite popular but I've not seen many low 30s outside unless they lack the nerve to go into Paw. Better exp is earned inside Paw past 30, IF you know how to pull. That's where most people go wrong in Paw. Like any dungeon, a bad pull will train you out. My favorite camping spot is in a little alcove across from the double doors that lead to the bridge. A single gnoll spawns there but he is easily dispatched, even when in the middle of a pull. The only problem I've had there is when someone tried to pull from that room or the bridge into the two rooms past the alcove. What many fail to realize is that you might as well pull straight through the alcove group if you do this as anything from there will agro to the alcove. <br />
/rant off <br />
If you have a capable group and a good puller then by all means try the alcove at your level. It's good, constant exp and you can make very nice progress (and pick up some Splitpaw Hide armor to boot <br />

There's some tricks a cleric can use to solo on the second floor of unrest, using closets and IVU <br />
Basically, find a mob near a closet, drag it in there, close the door, and kill it. IVU, med up and repeat. You can do this with your warrior friend, but make sure you keep him IVU'd, and don't let him pull. He's got a long run back if he dies. You can bind right at zone. <br />
Just duo the darkbones, skeletal monks, and carrion ghouls in the closets. You can solo these. Getting wolfform from a druid makes you non-aggro in the zone until you attack something. (Ever wonder why you see that lone wolf in the closet? - They're medding up) <br />

Try Cazic - but stay AWAY from the evil courtyard. <br />
I made from about 25-30 down there. Go up the ladder by the front door, go down, around, and into the pool room. With a good group of tanks/healers/blasters, gators are some of the finest experience around. Even up to about level 35 I think they were good. <br />
They're real tough, and you will probably want an enchanter (but who doesn't?) for multiples. But the exp is very good if you have a smart puller. <br />

Ok the best spot you the two of you at your level is the undead ruins.<br />
1. Necro wont touch you just dont use any AOE spells and pull mobs up the little hill with a tree on it, out of his way. <br />
2. The more you keep the ruins clear of greenies the more blues and whites will spawn, however if 4 GS spawn then you may be in trouble. So When I hunt there alone I always keep the one by the tree thats away from the ruins clear and then every other spot clear to give me some room. Do not clear the center spot by the pillar with the rune on it as then Big Red may spawn. Hes 30ish and resists most of my spells at 28. <br />
3. the zone to Feerot is very close, just run north and its your first right. I made it to the zone with 4 GS on me and no sow, so it can be a good safety valve. <br />
4. the GS, barbed bones and skel monks are far better xp that Cyclops and better loot to. Barbed bones drop FS and they all drop some pp at times. <br />
5. if you pull two use fear, all the times i did the mob never ran into the ruins and brough back another and if they do, zone. <br />
Good luck, this is good xp all the way up to 32, and it is always fun to beat on undead  <br />

I hate to say it, but Mistmoore might be good for you. Once in a while, I will go there and kill things in the first area by the lake. If there is no one around, you can usually find one or two inkies standing by themselves, and if you are up on the hill, the trains usually go by. If you think Unrest is trainy, don't bother,though. <br />
