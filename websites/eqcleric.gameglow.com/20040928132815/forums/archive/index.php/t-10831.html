<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">04-17-2001, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this has been discussed previous times, but Im curious what is the most AC some of our more experienced raid clerics found effective.  I've heard the 900 cap for pre-expansion, 1100 ac for kunark, and 1500 ac for velious, but seems that is more based toward Tank ac rather than cleric ac.  Since our defense is capped at 200 and we only have a meager dodge kill (70?), our effectiveness with certain AC is different than say a tank with all the defensive skills.<br />
<br />
At what point do you find sufficient AC?  Im curious what some of my fellow high level clerics feel it is at.  Than do you go for more HP gear, or Mana gear?  This is discounting the mobs that you need to raise certain resists for.  This is more of what people's general raid gear would be like.  For example I have like 1086 AC self buffed with 216 wisdom (cant seem to drop it any further) and like 2900ish hp, mana items isnt really that high, I would guess I have maybe +250ish in extra mana gear.  Previously I had 1096 AC but I dropped it by 10 ac and added about 150 more hps.  I dont really notice that extra 10 ac, but the 150 could possible help.  My normal resist just buffed with GMR is like 99 PR, 155 MR, 100 DR, 140 FR, 110 CR.  My current thinking is get 200 wis, go 1050 ac, than go for more hp gear with decent resist.  <br />
<br />
Anyway Im really curious how others configure their gear.  I know some other high level clerics dont seem as concerned with their ac, while others do.  Our guild plans on hunting in ToV soon.  Normally I would probably get one of the first few pieces of plate that drop, but if getting more ac wont help, I rather pass on it so my guild tanks can get well equipped.  Especially with how much rarer the ToV drops are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Anyway any thoughts or imput would be appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viscera</div><div class="date">04-18-2001, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My rough stats are 990 AC and 2600 HP with Heroism, Aegis, and Naltron. I also have about +400 in mana, and WIS around 192-196. My unbuffed resists with normal exp gear are around 50 each, and can get magic and fire/cold to just shy of 100 with my resist gear. So while I consider myself fairly well-equipped, I am still shy of your stats, and I'm still missing 3 pieces of Blue Diamond armor, and 4 pieces of Thurgadin armor. Playing on a blue server helps a bit.<br />
<br />
With regards to raids, well, I haven't done too many uber-raids, but I enjoy 1 group activities, and the occasional 2-4 group raid. So while I don't have the experience of slaying Trakanon, Velketor, or even going to ToV yet, I will say that I am pretty well-prepared. AC helps, but if you get aggroed by something, you are going to go down fast, so I'm thinking if I can get to 1000 AC unbuffed, I will go for HP/mana/resists, not sure which order yet, but will probably put mana last, since I have never really &quot;needed&quot; more mana in a big fight, yes it would have been nice, but I was able to adjust earlier in the fight.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">04-18-2001, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sort of what Im worried about Arturo.  My guild is working on Kael faction not Skyshrine.  Seems like with Kael armor I would gain basically more AC, and right now Im skeptically that it will actually make a difference.  Skyshrine armor with the higher stats would at least offer something different than what my current set up is, being more resist and more hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">04-18-2001, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not too worried about AC now.  I have a 1075 self buffed ac and with CoE that puts me right at 1100.  With some more SS pieces I will be able to easily hit 1100.  So right now I'm mainly concerened adding HPs.  Most of my guild and one other is on CoV faction.  It makes it nice since we dont have to compete with the other Giant factioned guilds for playtime or armor bits.<br />

<br />
The only fights I gear up AC for is Dain and Vindicator/Statue, at about 1100 self-buffed, every other raid I run about 1000ac with high resist/hp gear.<br />

Usual stats for bigger mobs were 1100ac 3650hp with around 500 in +mana. Especially after I started using Word of Redemption lots I've enjoyed the high hps immensily  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">04-19-2001, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's totally dependant on the mob.<br />
Does it have a sick AE?<br />
Do you expect to take melee dmg?<br />
What does the mob hit for?<br />
Does it quad attack? Flurry? Rampage?<br />
etc...etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">04-19-2001, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jeez Delheru...that is a good 400-450 more than I have with my buffs and shaman buffs (focus and stamina).  Max hp I remember Ive gotten is like 3160 and about 1100 ac (with agi or shissar).  Could you list a couple of you high hp or high stamina items that you use?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelana</div><div class="date">04-19-2001, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, currently in normal gear, I am at 1095 AC self buffed with Aegloism and AoP, MR is at 105 (unbuffed) and wisdom is at 225 (YES, I know its high, but I honestly cant find any way to lose more wisdom, as the wisdom is all coming from gear which has alot of other benefits) erm cant remember my HP, but i am over 3000 with full raid buffs. If a mob casts damage I usually lose some AC for resists (usually slap on BD bracers, maybe Diamond rings if I feel the extra resists are worth losing 130HP can grade this up to about 200 unbuffed for each resist)<br />
<br />
Wish i could lose some wisdom.....<br />

A very small minority can get close with just self buffs though. There are a few out there with multiple +100ish mana/hp items, I wish I was one of them.  =/<br />
The highest my hp have ever been is ~3500.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">04-21-2001, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm my hps come mostly from having a lot of templars and then stuff like Sacrifice/Eye of CT (just 50hp from that though). Self buffed hp is ~3200, then add to that divine str, focus, riotous health and the hammer buff thingee for a lot of hps and ~70sta. Result is bit below 3700hp.<br />
