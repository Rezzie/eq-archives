Valoran, of Maelin Starpyre<br />
<br />
<br />
Our Focus<br />
Our focus is primarily on Gates of Discord content, working on Uqua and advancing beyond.  We still however raid the Plane of Time, so that we can better equipt our members both new and old.  We tend to raid every night except Fridays, with some exceptions.  We aim to both have fun, and get the job done.  <br />
<br />
Raid Times<br />
Our standard starting time is 7PM EST .  There are a few occasions where that start time would be anywhere from 6:30pm est-8pm est.  The situation dictates that, in regards to turnout, patches, what type of raid it is, what day it is etc., <br />
<br />
<br />
Raids usually end anywhere from 11pm EST-3AM EST.  This depends on, again, the situation.  We take into consideration, how often we've been raiding, how late, what raids are upcoming.<br />
<br />
We have members from all over the world, if you are not an EST timezone player but can still manage to raid the majority of our hours please speak to one of our contacts.<br />
<br />
 What we are looking for<br />
Recruitment will always remain open for dedicated, skillful, mature players.  Raid attendance weighs heavily, if you can not attend at least 5 raids most weeks then Valoran is not a fit for you.<br />
<br />
A mininum of 100 AA is required to apply, however you will be asked to work on certain AA during your app period and if accepted as a member to continue improving yourself through valuable AA if not met yet.<br />
<br />
Cross-Server Applicants are welcome and encouraged, however please make sure you speak to one of our contacts first. ( ;tell maelin.Allure, or ;tell maelin.Allurez or ;tell maelin.Avasheon or email Avasheon@Valoran.net)<br />
<br />
Flags<br />
<br />
1) All recruits are expected to have the Gates of Discord expansion.  Kod'Taz flagged is not a MUST, however it is a MUST that you work on and complete that flag as the majority of our raids require it.<br />
<br />
2) Plane of Time flag is not required, although a huge plus.  If you already have a few God kills but are missing 1-2, that is also taken into consideration.  While Plane of Time isn't our primary focus, we do raid it and will continue to.  <br />
<br />
3) Elemental Flagged is not a requirement, it is in your best interest to get flagged however.  This will open up more group possibilities, and better exp to work on AA. <br />
