<br />
I don't have the exact loc, but if you zone in from FV, turn right and follow the zone wall.  You will go past the skel ruins (which are a good spot, but I find the greater spurbones spawn regularly there, and they are too tough for me at lv40.  But plaguebones are semi-regular spawns, and if you pull with a spell its 100% single pulls  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif)<br />
<br />
But keep going, you'll hit the north wall, turn left (west) and continue along only for about a minute or so.  If you come to the zone to Frontier Mountains you've gone too far.<br />
<br />
Here you will find a solo plaguebone skel, who spawns in one spot, and just stands there.  At lv40 I can root/nuke and kill it with 1-2 bubs of mana left, and noticeable xp bar movement in Hell 40.  Sit, and med up.<br />
<br />
As soon as you get up with fm (ie 5-6 mins later) the plaguebone will have respawned.  Root/nuke/med.<br />
<br />
Continue until you get bored  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  This is an excellent way to level if you have other stuff you can do in 5 minute chunks (housework etc).  And I think it is far better than screwing around with the perma camped, buggy, lifetapping spectres of Ferrott.  And of course, you are close to Frontier Mountains, where you can try for a Belt of the Cenobite.<br />
<br />
So try it out, loot is good without being great (averaging 2pp each), but the xp is nicely moving along, and not having to chase around to find kills is great  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.<br />

<br />
Is the run from fv to there dangerous?  I checked out the fv to dreadlands zone with my druid last night, and several drachnids come up on tracking.  As she sat there (waiting for daybreak to do her reconnaissance mission) they were casting, so they must be close.  Anything else on the route you describe to watch for?<br />

*Editing* to say I am comfortable with run from FV to dreadlands zone (I use the tunnel from inside the town which drops you close to the west wall a bit south of tunnel to dreadlands). Shaiel noted said drachnids from the mouth of the tunnel looking out over the dreadlands, and it is from this point to your camp that I am curious about.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
I went to said spot and found solo plague bone.  Conned black to my 40 cleric.  So, I called a 43 pallie that I know over as insurance.  Pallie has ghoulbane.  This skellie owned the two of us.  Whole bar of mana from me, LOH from pallie.  Luckily we had sow and we both booked for the zone.<br />
<br />
Beware<br />
<br />
PS- let me be clear- pallie was fighting too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Igmod</div><div class="date">08-10-2000, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Plaguebone is not the only thing that spawns there.  I saw a Greater Plaguebone which conned yellow to me (lvl 42).  One thing about the ruins is that the Greater Spurbones often fill up the spawn points and if they resist even partially then I run out of mana and have to zone.  Ugh.  I am hoping that at 44 they still give exp and I can own them with Banish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemean</div><div class="date">08-10-2000, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm - odd about the lv40 black plaguebone.  All the times I've been there the plaguebones have all been blue.  I did see one spawn of a Greater Plaguebone last night though, and that was red to me, so I moved on.<br />
<br />
So I'm a wee bit confused about the black plaguebone.  Perhaps I've just had a lucky run.  Not sure :/<br />
<br />
And yeah Igmod, I agree on the ruins with greater spurbones.  I can't solo em, and if the ruins fill up, yeah, no more soloing there.<br />
<br />
Still, I suggest trying the solo spot.  It looks like its not 100% easy spawns, but I still think its a pretty good spot.<br />
<br />
Nem.<br />
<br />
And with the run from fv, I find its ok as long as you stick closish to the zone wall.  I've never had anything aggro me, and there are drachnids wandering around (and a camp spot full of them nearby), but they tend to not go too close to the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Igmod</div><div class="date">08-11-2000, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing about this place.  I am really interested in getting the most experience in the least amount of time right now and I thought this would be it but I am reconsidering.  The Greater Spurbones CAN be soloed but they take 10 casts of Expel Summoned which is just about all my mana (180 wis).  They also take a while to bring down.  I figure the time it takes to kill one and regain all my mana is about 10 - 12 minutes.  I do get movement in the exp bar every kill but it still takes me 2 hours to get a bubble at this rate IF I kill a greater every attempt which is rare.  <br />
<br />
I heard Specs may be easier since they only have about 1500 hps instead of the 2500+ hps of the Greater Spurs.  I may head to Lguk or SolB until lvl 44 then come back with Banish and see what I can do.<br />
<br />
The solo spot is awesome if you can get a Plaguebone every time.  I can't figure out how to get rid of the Greater Plaguebone.  Can I drag it to some other mob in the zone?  I certainly can't solo it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now this spot and the greater plague bone that spawns here is tough.  I can easily solo the regulars using only 1/2 my manna sometimes 3/4 if I get alot of resists.  I tried snare fearing this with a lvl 35 ranger.  We took it down pretty good but the danm thing ran nearly to BW zone.  Eventually the ranger and I got seperated and my fear wore off we had him down to about 1/4 life but he came back and killed us.<br />

The ruins have been camped regularly where it used to be MY spot!!  Anyway, now at 45 with 183 WIS I can solo the Greater Plaguebones if I get no more than 1 or 2 resists but it uses almost ALL my mana and therefore the downtime is almost not worth it.  I can bring down 2 out of 3 successfully.  I try not to mess with them if there are other spawns up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zannah</div><div class="date">09-05-2000, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive found this spot to be excellent as well - topped off lvl 40 here, grouped in Kaesora for a good long day and then got a bubble and 3/4 here again to get into lvl 42 !!<br />
<br />
Greater Plaguebones are a problem.  The first one I saw conned blue to me at lvl 40, but I burned all my mana and only got it down to 1/3 health so I left.  The others Ive seen have con'd yellow, so thats a no go.  I suppose you could root/nuke/root/med, but I haven't been sucessful with that.<br />
<br />
Here is the key:  This mob is the placeholder for the 'rotting' skeleton or some such thing.  It drops one of the key pieces for Veshans Peak.  Find someone who needs to camp the spawn for that one super rare mob, and they can help you clear (the faster the better for them !!)  Ive been able to do enough damage to get the exp - basically KSing from a lvl 60 who was just melee'ing to keep it aggroed.<br />
<br />
Now I just need a name for my new lil' skelly friend  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />

<br />
Hmm bad news for me, was thinking of camping the hill spectre some.  How is it buggy?  <br />
<br />
Also, since necro lifetaps are resistable I assumed the spectres lifetaps might be as well and cast MR buff on us before fighting last time.  Didnt resist any lifetaps though, are they unresistable and I'm just wasting mana?<br />
<br />
Killed him once pretty easy with a friend, and was thinking I could solo, but if its bugged in some way which brings death I want no parts of it =/<br />
