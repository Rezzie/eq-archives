<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyon</div><div class="date">06-06-2000, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is anyone else experiencing excessive aggro in Kunark?  I've been grouping at the drolvarg temple in FV.  Once in combat, the warrior types start fighting, and melee ensues.  Once I cast the first heal, I get any unengaged mobs come straight at me.  Ok, this is normal.  Heal is a big taunt.  The difference here in Kunark is that now all I have to do is go anywhere NEAR the temple, and every drolvarg inside comes screaming out the front and makes a bee-line for yours truly.  <br />
<br />
When we sit on the back steps of the temple, any wanderers that come near run straight at me.  They bypass all the warriors, and start whacking me.  When the warrior type pulls, the drolvargs will almost always, run past the bow weilding warrior and make way to me.  Anything that spawns at any of the spawn sites in the temple, will come charging directly at me the moment that they spawn.<br />
<br />
This has eliminated the need for a puller.  I just sit at the top of the steps, and we wait for stuff to aggro me.  Keeps the whole group busy for hours.  I'm getting phenominal exp.  Taking beating though.  <br />
<br />
Just wondering if anyone else has experienced such a phenominon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samsara</div><div class="date">06-06-2000, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, I've heard lots of tales of seemingly random aggro since the release of Kunark (and not just in the new lands).<br />
<br />
Bards are talking about it everywhere, since their songs affect the whole party.  Partly I believe this has to do with the fact that mobs can &quot;forget&quot; about you in Kunark, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I noticed it in East Karana with my bard, shortly after the expansion was released.  After I had been killing reavers for awhile, at a certain point they would just keep coming down to the shore, I didn't even have to pull.  And I was fighting solo.  It was truly weird.<br />
<br />
I think Verant has admitted that creatures now have an abnormally large radius within which they will cry for help or transfer their hate.  Now whether admitting it leads to a fix remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
Until then, it's best to try and buff your party when you're sure there's not already stuff mad at them in the zone.  That's not always possible, but it's the best I can think of.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanedar</div><div class="date">06-06-2000, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Absolutely.... I have been hunting in Lake of Ill Omen the last few nights in the Sarnack Castle, and after a while of fighting, it seems the spawn points auto aggro on me or other clerics (sometimes other members too but mainly me ;(.  Someone said that it maybe the tattooed head on the body's of some Sarnacks, however I did not have any in inventory, nor did anyone else in the party.  <br />
<br />
We would just med after a fight, and a few moments later... whack! A few times I was looking up and actually saw a Sarnack spawn on the other side of the fortress and immediately make a b-line to me at the rear of our group (not actually in the fortress, we were camped on a ledge overlooking the courtyard)  We were WELL out of the aggro range of the spawn point.<br />
<br />
Two nights now in a row this has happened, an epic battle has ensued for 30-40 mins of continuous pulls and frantic heal/meds, and eventually we have to bail out or get taken down.<br />
<br />
I even logged during the battle and it did not correct the problem.  After we died (the first night), then we were fine again. Last night I was tired a frustrated from running, so we just called it a night so I am not sure if zoning corrects the bug. <br />
<br />
Posted to Everquest message boards but alas... no reply.<br />
<br />
Guess the only redeming factor was that we gained almost as much exp as we lost from the deaths.  Still frustrating to battle for 30 mins... getting down to 1 mob... killing him and 3 more instantly appear....  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauntek</div><div class="date">06-06-2000, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm..I am reminded of comments in Cazic Thule(and other areas) where players say, Attack the healer first, kill him as soon as you see him. Maybe the critters have picked up on what clerics look like *G*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">06-07-2000, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What happens is, probably, that you have three different radii on the monsters. You have the aggro radius, you have the &quot;continue to follow to smash&quot; radius and the &quot;help help I am getting hurt&quot; radius.<br />
<br />
The last one of these seems to be too big...<br />
<br />
Now lets say that the tank goes and pulls a few mobs. Those within aggro radius starts to follow him. Some other mobs were inside the &quot;help help getting hurt&quot; radius, and gets the puller on their hate list. Later, while fighting, or after fight, you heal the puller. This puts YOU on the hate list, and since the puller hasn't done any damage to it, you go to the top. This is why when such a mob gets near camp, it goes straight for the healer (or the bard).<br />
<br />
As for the autoaggroing, I'm not quite sure how it works, but it might be that the spawning critter is within range of another that is aggro on you, but out of &quot;follow and smash&quot; radius, which would make the spawning critter go straight for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakalwe</div><div class="date">06-07-2000, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's probably not related, since this has been happening since before Kunark was out, but I have been spending a load of time hunting spectres in the Feerott lately, and noticed that it is sometimes possible to get specs from the cave autopulling to you.<br />
<br />
I'm 45th now, and solo, but when I was grouped here we would do the tree and 1 or 2 from the cave. After a couple of pulls from the cave, the first spec in there would invariably end up pulling himself as soon as he spawned, coming up the hill to the tree spot for us. This was great for convenience, but we were at a loss to explain it. Note that this would happen even if the tree spec was not spawned, ie we weren't fighting anything else for the cave spec to come 'help' with.<br />
