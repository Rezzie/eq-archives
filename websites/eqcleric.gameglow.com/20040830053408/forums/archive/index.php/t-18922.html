<br />
Knights Nocturnal are now accepting cross server applicants for our guild. We are a small tight knit group of similar minded individuals who like to have fun playing Everquest. Our raid times are quite rare, not just on SolRo but on most servers. We do not begin raiding until 10 pm PST. This allows our members time to spend with their families in the evening and is perfect for those who work late. <br />
<br />
However, our play times make it tough for people in the EST, as not a lot of us are online early in the evening. <br />
<br />
Currently our guild is working on Emp and VT keys. We are hoping to begin our progression through PoP soon. We have aspirations of exploring all of Everquest's raiding content. <br />
<br />
For more information on our guild loot policies and requirements visit our website at forums.eqnocturnal.com <br />
<br />
You can also send a tell to one of our officers: elrico, ziluk, xenidor, gretl, wildeagle, doktorr, and ariocc. <br />
<br />
I look forward to meeting you in game, keep safe and good adventuring to you. <br />
<br />
