Fighting at the green pools is fairly safe from trains and great for experience.</div></div><hr />

I have a map from eqatlas, but I don't think the spot is labelled as &quot;green pool.&quot;  Is it a spot that you have to swim down to get to?  Do you need a full group?  The time I play, there is at most 6 people in CT- two of which are myself (30, almost 31 cleric) and 30 warrior.<br />

You'll have to swim down the shaft... you are now in the blue pool. When you get out of the water, follow the hallway and you come to the green pool.  Once you see it you will know why they call it that.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />
<br />
There is another way to get there, but I don't know it.<br />

Charming spot tho (and if you can pull from both pools near constant action).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">05-15-2000, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone know if this will be a tight fit for the large races?<br />
<br />
BTW- eqatlas' map does show a second way to get there.  So,while I can't describe it, I can point to where you can find it.<br />
<br />
Rauntek- do you recall the levels of your group?  I am wondering how big a group I need to get to do this.  At the times that I play, CT is very empty!  This am, there were 6 total, including me.  And I knew the people and that they would be logging off shortly as they were West Coast people. I would like to find something that Slugga (30/31 ogre warrior) and myself (32 cleric) can duo or have minimal other help.<br />

I was lowest at 28, the rest were between 30 and 35.. and we had *NOT* trouble with anything else, even when we had 3 or 4 gators pop up, it was only the Iron Golem that knocked us all back.. I believe part of that the wizzie said his spells were being resisted, but I could NOT keep my heals cast as fast as the monk was taking damage.. I don't even remember what happened to the magicians pet that it died so quickly..</div></div><hr />
