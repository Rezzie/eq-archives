<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cael</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few days ago, I got Yaulp 4, and today traded it in to the vendor for united resolve, level 54.   The mana cost is low, but who would ever cast this instead of the level 52 spell heroic bond, or just plain old heroism?<br />
<br />
Who wouldn't spend 90 more mana to cast group heroism compared to group reso?<br />
<br />
United resolve should be level 52, and heroic bond should be level 54.   The current status of these spells makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

Have you tried?  Which buff overwrites which?  This needs to be checked out  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Cast Hero and then UR and see if UR replaces it, and vice versa, in the event that they don't stack.<br />
<br />
If no, it may need to be /bugged<br />

The dumbass answer was that it was a reduced mana cost, and would buff group members that were below the limit for hero.....<br />
Like I ever group with anyone that low.....or plan to....<br />

And if you have heroism on when you cast united resolve, you get the message 'the spell does not take hold'.   United resolve is exactly like resolution (same additions to hp and ac) and will be overwritten by hero.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenken</div><div class="date">06-03-2000, 05:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might also having to do with Heroic Bond actually not being in the game right now  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  I've not heard of anyone anywhere obtaining it through any means.<br />
<br />
United Resolve, as I've mentioned before is pretty much useless. I'd much rather United Resolve was removed from the game and Heroic Bond put in it's place.<br />

GZ was supprised that Group Hero was 52... its supposed to be level 57.    As for Group Reso and Frotitude... they are there to help us manage our mana beter... In reality they are worthless since most casters bitch when I give them reso instead of hero, and tanks need your best HP buffs for more effective CH's.  Group reso is perfect for buffing newbies camping dervs (even though its 54 it still works on green cons, I tested it)<br />
