<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xene</div><div class="date">10-31-1999, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK here we are I am helping my guildmates get the BS Tunic in Unrest.  Ok there is 20 some people on in unrest 6 are in the basement camping ghost.  I and 2 other guildmates were in the Tower camping for the knight.  Ok I am 39(almost 40) so camping up there is easy.  And yes I get exp for this area.  Well along comes a warrior named Sinlun or something like that and sits in the knight spot.  Well I informed him that we are camping for the knight.(preivously he pull stold the knight after I pulled him from the tower)  He rants off in chinese and then says this is not your house. Well I then informed him he has no chance of taking a kill from me.  Well no to long after his party comes up.  So here we are 3 on 3.  I tried to inform his party that we are here for the knight but again they refused to leave us alone.  Well a hag spawns and the little warrior attacks but I am now upset so 2 expels later I took the hag.  A few minutes later the knight spawns and yes I killed the knight.  Then their cleric who must have bought his account(mormmin or something like that) says he is goning report me for KSing.  Now here is my question.  All morning I have been clearing the tower and camping for the knight, so where does this non player get off calling me a kill stealer?  He has no clue who I am or how much I have helped everyone.  So to you three &quot;Xene make a rude gesture to you for your attitudes&quot;<br />

P.S. LOOTED TUNIC 4 TIMES IN A ROW THANK YOU!!!!!!<br />

I don't know if they are ex-quake players or what, but there's a lot of people out there that will train on you, steal your kills, and the like, but as soon as you do it to them, they get the &quot;I'm gonna tell my mommy on you&quot; syndrome.  I guess there isn't really anything we can do about it.  Can't get away from them, unless you like watching the stump, because they are everywhere.  Guess we just have to live with them.</div></div><hr />

Back at about 22 my group was camping the tower in Lake Rathe for Aviaks.  We had been getting great exp and were having a good time until a group shows up and demands that we &quot;share&quot;.  3 aviaks spawn at one time... there isn't exactly a whole lot to share.  We tried reasoning with them, but the mere thought that we were there first didn't sink into their heads so they began to just take stuff.  This of course was before group damage was counted.  They brought in a level 30 wizard to help them and soon were taking ever spawn.<br />
<br />
My group was fed up, and they left... but I didn't.  I just sat there.  I was mad.. I had never done anything to this group... and this is how they wanted to treat me.. that's fine!<br />
<br />
I opened my spell book and memed my favorite and wonderful fear spell and waited for the next spawn that these wonderful kill stealers would be taking.  Pop goes the aviak, they attack, pop goes my fear spell, Fortissimo waves bye bye to the birdy.<br />
<br />
Two of their group runs after it... oh look another birdy.. the other 4 attack, I cast fear, bye bye birdy... 2 more of their group run after that one.  Last birdy pops, last to remaining attack, I cast fear, bird runs off.. then I sit there for a couple seconds and run down the plank to see the fun.<br />
<br />
5 people, all near death, one already dead, and 3 pissed off birdies nail them to the ground.<br />
<br />
They weren't exactly happy with me, in fact they petitioned gm's saying I was not playing in good manners... I just simply laughed and went on my happy way.  All is fair in game and war, and that night I got my pure satisfaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People should learn not to upset a cleric.  We may not be able to out nuke them but we can sure make things hard to catch 8).  Glad to see I was not wrong oh one last funny thing that made us all chuckle and proved that these were not regulars is they tried to pull the yield rull on me.  BAH it was never implemented and probably for a good reason.  Thanks for listening.<br />

Once again it seems Verant can't keep all it's people on the same page. Maybe someone who has Brad's ear (can you turn that into the Capt in Keep for exp??) can get an official position??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zachton</div><div class="date">11-02-1999, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">speaking of pissing off a cleric I remember one tell, my warrior brother Arafein laughed his ass off though it kinda gave clerics a bad name.<br />
A cleric had been camping some item can't remember what it was, but several new group members came in, he welcomed them and did what a cleric does.<br />
Then the item droped, they decided clerics didn't need items so why should they give him anything?  JUst sit there and heal us.<br />
He was mad, but he stayed.  The new group had spawn again, he let them fight, sudently they realzied cleric wasn't healing, they died.  Cleric fished off creature, looted, disbanded, laughed his arse off to the zone.  Don't mess with a cleric (I personaly wouldn't let people die I would have just left, but I see some irony in this particular method.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raefin</div><div class="date">11-03-1999, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I somewhat disagree with the way you handled the situation. I am speaking of the Knight and aviak examples specificaly. While I can understand the time you have put into camping the knight for the tunic. Other people would also like a shot at getting the tunic. What would have been the matter with splitting the spawn. Where group one gets the knight first then group two gets the second spawn of the knight and so forth and so on. As for the aviaks you say that there were 3 aviaks that spawn there so why not share there as well. While I understand that you were there first what is wrong with showing a little civility and sharing with other groups. If you feel that the experience gains were not enough if you shared the spawn then i ask you how much exp did you get fearing away a whole bunch of birds. If cooperation had occured you would not have been nearly as mad as you ended up and both groups would have benefitted. Perhaps they would have helped your group out if they ran into problems or vice versa. I do not mean to offend anyone here all I am trying to say is that if you treat other people fairly they will usually appreciate it and be fair in return. If however they thought they were going to just take the spawn then what you did seems reasonable enough.<br />

i have held 2 bird isle at lvl 17 with a lvl 17 SK, it was LOTS of fun doing do.  i can't imagine the boredom of camping 3 aviak guards with a group of 6 and (i assume) a group of 3+ members.  <br />
and don't give me the &quot;but EQ is a social game, just sit there and chat&quot;.  go to the chat rooms for that, i am in EQ to KILLKILLKILL!!! <br />
<br />
btw if they had a lvl 30 wiz friend why wouldn't he just 'port them somewhere else for equal/better xp?  i hear there are dungeons around Norrath, certainly there is xp there as well.<br />
