<br />
was me (51cleric), a 51druid, and a 54 warrior.<br />
<br />
We were killing the 4 &quot;gate&quot; spawns at the entrance to the fort, as well as 1 or 2 spawns from inside if time permitted. It was very easy with harmony pulling and was very good experience for all of us. We pulled thru about 4 spawn cycles (approx. 6 minutes on respawns) and in that time there was only 1 mob that conned green to our warrior.<br />
<br />
It was refreshing to find that spot, we had ran thru it upon occasion on our way to chardok, and I have only ever seen it camped once. Of course there are other potential camping areas within the fort itself as well. <br />
<br />
I am always looking for another spot to hunt that is rewarding and not contested... i simply deplore Karnage Castle as, IMHO, it seems to be Crushbone on steriods.<br />
<br />
Just thought i would pass that along<br />

I was there some time ago with a mage and a necro, works nice too.<br />
We got a nice amount of xp and even one of those nifty 2hs each wich drops there (forgot the name of the darn blade).<br />
<br />
Crushbone on steroids?<br />
Heh, DVinn could be compared to VS, but I think DVinn has responsibility for alot more deaths  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />
