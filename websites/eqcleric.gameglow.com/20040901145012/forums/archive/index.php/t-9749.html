<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">11-25-1999, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe this isn't a problem on other servers, but lately Tunare is really bad for high level characters farming the items in the 35-40 range.  Lower guk is especially bad -- don't even think about getting a chance at the evil eye, or mino pat (the other night, a level 50 group had their wizard port to gfay everytime they got an evil eye bag, and auctioned several off that evening)...  The only chance you have is to get the lore no-drop items...<br />
<br />
This is very frustrating, since Verant made a big deal about their new &quot;play-nice&quot; policy, and then did absolutely nothing about it.  The guides, when petitioned, say that there has been no implementation of this policy yet.<br />
<br />
So in the meantime, you hang out killing no-named mobs for the experience... I guess in the hope that someday we too will be 50th and farming the items?<br />
<br />
And let's not talk about spectres... I've been wanting payback on them for a looong time.  Finally get a group of 35 plus together, to take them out -- and a level 49 wizard comes along and takes over.  Seems he plans on hitting level 50 off them (mustn't have any friends).<br />
<br />
So far, I've not seen where the new planes and kedge keep have done anything to alleviate the problem of excess high level characters.  Are other servers having this problem too?  Or is it just a Tunare problem?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did have a problem once with a level 40 ish &amp;lt;Elitist&amp;gt; Guild player.  She came to the zone with about 3 level 25 players she was farming items for.  It was late at night (there were only 6 of us there).  She started by referring to our level 20 party as &quot;the little people&quot; and told us to leave the zone now as she was camping Unrest and we would get spatted by her pulls if we didn't.  That is the only bad incident I have ever had.  I reported her but of course it was never answered.<br />
<br />
From my Experience HPH is the only exception where Etiquette seems to go out the door, it's always a free for all on the PGT and KS’ing is a common practice.<br />

(at least as far as I can tell)  Any night you can go to Lower Guk and find one person (ONE) camping 3 named spawns by themself.  What really pisses me off is when this person is doing it to SELL THE ITEMS ON EBAY.  It's frustrating but there is nothing you can do about it!<br />

Hundreds of them.  They don't have anything to do between Plane and Dragon raids except farm crud for friends or twinks or Ebay. Yeah it's sad, Lower Guk makes me sick now. I don't go in there if I can help it. The farming situation is because (even with Verants effort) there is very little for the 50's to do.<br />

<br />
Oh, and Erondil, gimme a /tell in game some time... Remember Riayne, from Companions of Norrath?... well... if ya wanna remenisce, I'm up for it hehe<br />

I play on Tunare too .. was in Lower Guk the other night.  Saw a group trying to camp the savant and cavalier.  We moved into the cavalier room and said sorry, we're taking it (no one in my group needed the items dropped by the cavalier, not even to sell or trade, just that having a room is better than camping the jail).  Then we moved to the executioner room.  Later that night when we were down a couple of people, another group came in and tried to camp the savant and executioner - while we were still there.  We said, no way we're not leaving, we can hold this room.  They were a little annoyed with us, but &amp;lt;shrug&amp;gt;.  There are very few times when I've actually camped an item that I've needed - I hope I don't resort to item farming when (if) I ever get to 50.<br />
Question though ... wasn't Verant &quot;supposed&quot; to open a high lvl undead dungeon in Tox forest?  Or was that just a rumor?  And, while the idea of an underwater dungeon is nice ... maybe they should make Kedge a little more accessible.  Yeah, you can get an aqualung or rebreather from a tinkerer - for how many thousands of plat?  (I'm happy that I finally managed to get over 700pp).  I suppose you could buy a whole bunch of enduring breath potions .... but I'm usually in a place for hours, could I really *buy* that many potions?  Yeah, okay ... shamen, druids, necros, bards have spells/songs that allow breathing underwater ..... what happens if they go LD, or have to leave, or are OOM when the spell wears off?  Better get out fast!   &amp;lt;sigh&amp;gt;  Oh, well.<br />

One has to acclimate themselves to it. After a few straight hours down there you'll forget you're underwater, and with the right party it's oh so sweet. You'll wish you never asked for it to become &quot;easier&quot; for others to access, and pray they make it worse. ***you will forget you read this...forrrrggeeeeettttttt***<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">12-19-1999, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, Item farming is so bad on Cazic-Thule that I had to implement a new policy twards known item farmers. If a guild group has members that need an item from someplace, and when they get there its camped by a known farmer, they get competition for the spawn. No more of this crap of a 2 man ebay group camping the sage, executioner, cavalier and savant. If someone in my group needs a runed cowl, etc..., we go take the spawn, and any other spawns we want. Ebay boys can piss off and go find a job.  =)<br />
