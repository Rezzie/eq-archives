<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">10-27-1999, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is really frustrating right now trying to get the Bloodstained Tunic on the Innoruuk Server. I have yet to see one for sale and have only seen one person actually wearing one.<br />
<br />
considering how many people are in Unrest and the number of Tunics that should be out there, The market is pretty damned dry. In trading and saving and selling and just good luck, I have managed to accumulate 1100plat for buying good cleric items.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know about what a BS Tunic goes for on Innoruuk Server and do any of you have one that you would be willing to sell?<br />
<br />
Thanks Everyone<br />

I just spent a month in UNREST but because of trains and bad groups I was only able to loot the knight 3 times....and I got 3 mantles.  Its a good booby prize though because each time I sold it for 75pp.  <br />
<br />
My guild is going to UNREST to celebrate halloween on Saturday night.  We plan on taking over the house.  I fully expect to loot the knight many times then...i'm hoping for my own TUNIC.  You may be able to join our group if there is room (not everyone will be hunting the knight...the ghost is important too)<br />
