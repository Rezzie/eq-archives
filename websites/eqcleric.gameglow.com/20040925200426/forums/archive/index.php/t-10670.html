<br />
Here there is a large open room, you can get sow etc if you are with a druid... On the portal spawns Cyndreela a level 40 necromancer, with a blue pet (if she has time to get it up that is before we kill her)... and right behind you a cave stocked with spectres...<br />
<br />
Last night I brought a bunch of guild mates and we had a blast killing specs and Cyndreela.. however for best XP do it with a partner until 45 and then solo her after 45... She drops several platinum pieces each time as well I picked up a pearl bracelet off her that sold to a merchant for 65pp and I've heard she drops an 85pp ring as well from time to time..<br />
<br />
To reach her enter the spectre cave (you may have to clear most of the specs first) and follow the right hand wall all the way down to you see a dead end.  This is a fake wall, run though this wall and you enter the portal area.  Large open room, some annoying drybones spawn here too, easy to clear... <br />
<br />
So all in all a good, fairly safe spot.. Oh, and if you are under level 46 and run though the portal it teleports you near Ogguk, I never ran into any bouncers when I tried, but you might want to be careful.. so if you are getting beat, run through the portal  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif <br />
<br />
Have fun! <br />

I'm still not ready to solo her tho, tried once and she knocked me down to half life in about 30 seconds, had to invuln and run for cazic zone (don't wanna run thru portal now and end up alone and half dead in PoF -yikes!-)<br />
<br />
This is definitely one of THE best places to experience from 40 on up, expecially if you have one or two friends to do it with. Her spawn is around 5 mins, so there's really no down time. If you have alot of mana after killing her, hell... go pull a spec or two.<br />
It's constant exp and relatively safe - there  being the portal to hop thru if you should find yourself in trouble.<br />
<br />
Heh ok, time to go hop on and see if Odaer has beaten me to her...<br />

I was first shown the cave at 35. We did it in two small groups, a 46 Druid/43 Warrior on  the necro and me and a 33 Warrior on the pet. Very easy to get in if you pull the wandering spec from the cave entrance... Just run past the static spectre on your right as you enter, then stick to the right through the tunnels.<br />
