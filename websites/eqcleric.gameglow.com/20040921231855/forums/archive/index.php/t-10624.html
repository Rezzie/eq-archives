<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClericalBinge</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate this level.  This has been the worst level for me yet.  I am currently, half way thru it, and thats after like a week and a half.  I cannot seem to solo anything unless I am sow'd up, which of course at times can be a pain to get.  <br />
The people I normally group with are in their 40's, and I have been trying to catch up, but it aint workin anymore.  <br />
Unfortunatly, I know everyone gets up in arms about this, but, about 1.5 of the 2.5 bubs of XP i have are from Gnome Guards.  Yeah now everyone gets upset about guard killing.  I say this one thing.... If you looked at Steamfont from above, Its laid out perfectly to kill their guards.  Theres 3 indiviual ones, all with ample room to manuver, then when you get a friend, the gate guards are feasible.  These guards give amazing xp, all the from 35-46.  They spawn fast, little risk of dying, and most people (esp myself) give the weapons to the newbies.  I also help them kill the mobs they are being chased by.<br />
One other thing, I only do this as a DE, wearing a guise.  They are of course KOS to me now, but still indifferent as a dwarf.  <br />
I have spent time in Lguk, Sol b, and Kedge (kedge is more fun than anything) and they dont compare to the xp.  Other than the Bedroom Loop in Lguk, but it takes 3 hours to get into a party doing it.  Or there isnt enough people it seems =)<br />
<br />
When I get out of this level, I will most likely stop whackin guards, maybe again at 40, but we shall see.<br />
