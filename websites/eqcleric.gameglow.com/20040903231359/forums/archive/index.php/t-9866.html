I was in Nth Ro, helping be 'nanny' to two level 7 friends, stoppin' them dying to trains etc.<br />
<br />
50+_ranger_X tells to me &quot;Can you res my twink in Oasis?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Is your twink over 30?&quot;<br />
50+ &quot;Man! I wouldn't ask if I didn't need it!&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Well what level is your twink?&quot;<br />
50+: &quot;If his level matters I'm sorry I asked you man.&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;It matters to me if he's under 30. I don't do exp rezzes for under 30s.&quot;<br />
50+ &quot;Don't tell ME you can't rez under 30s, I KNOW I'm over 50...(short angry rant attacking me for lying about what clerics can do)&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Um, I didn't say I couldn't, I said I don't.&quot;<br />
50+ (general rant on what an unhelpful person I am, and how I better not ever ask for help from a ranger, cause ya know I'll be blacklisted, blah blah blah)<br />
Me: &quot;Sorry my policy offends you. It just happens to be my policy.&quot;<br />
50+ &quot;Well you just made my ignore list, along with all the other hasbeens.&quot;<br />
<br />
And you just made my no rez list, but not my day   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  And yet, and yet, still manage not to be /roleplay at level 40... and hate to have these confrontations.  So much better to say &quot;Sorry I'm busy&quot; without telling folks your rules and regs   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif Which I WILL learn to do.<br />
