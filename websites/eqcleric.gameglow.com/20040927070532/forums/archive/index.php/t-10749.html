<br />
My tactic when breaking the camp is to root the pet, then kick off a stun, nuke, stun, nuke.  Then I atone her pet -- poof.<br />
<br />
After that, I grab her before she pets up.  Lead in with a nuke, stun, nuke.  Sometimes, I have to throw a root in there to keep her from running up and hitting me.  She hits pretty hard, and can interrupt your spells easily.<br />
<br />
When going into the first fight I always buff with MR, FR, symbol, reso and AoF.  She casts both fire spells and magic spells.  As stated above there isn't really any need to refresh symbol.  She dies pretty quick usually.<br />
<br />
And no, there isn't any faction hit with her  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozna</div><div class="date">10-26-2000, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have killed her through lv 44 and now 2 bubs into 45 and it is easy xp with little risk.  I can break the camp easy without the symbol though using only 3 spells nuke, stun, fear.  I kept count and it takes 80 kills to get through lv 44 and 190 kills to get through lv 45 as i have counted the number of kills per bub.  That is ~20 hours to get through lv 45 killing her and ~9 hours for lv 44.  If you dont rez ppl and sit with your anon on you should not have to worry about people in lfay bothering you.  i do help lower lv people killing cog though while i am there.  I find the camp enjoyable because this is the first time i have soloed since lv 8.   Plus i can do other things while i time the spawn at 6mins.  I just hope this spawn doesn't get over camped now that it is out more now.<br />

in a group  i did kill happ and binn at 39 <br />
the group was 39cleric and 38necro  and once in a while we hade to zone :-(<br />
<br />

How can one justifying murdering a gnome lady who is not bothering any one in the middle of a forest?<br />
<br />
I can understand an inkie role playing this, but clerics from the &quot;good&quot; side?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemean</div><div class="date">11-14-2000, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it can be justified the same way as<br />
<br />
a) Creating erudite necro mules to buy Paineel keys because you are KOS in Paineel<br />
b) Creating ranger mules to track rare spawns in OOT<br />
c) Paladins grouping with necros and SKs<br />
d) Seeing a Lord Lucan being populated by heaps of Trolls, Ogres and Inkies, since they are KOS in Freeport anyway and don't worry about losing faction<br />
e) Seeing dorfs being constantly hunted in BB simply because they have no faction hits<br />
f) Paladins having to kill a Froglock Paladin to get ghoulbane<br />
<br />
Very simply, EQ is NOT a roleplaying game.  In fact, Verant don't even call it a MMORPG any more, they just call it a MMOG.  Its a first person tactical combat game, set in a Tolkienesque setting.<br />
<br />
Nem.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
And FYI - I've never done Happ, Dorfs etc, but I have hunted in Upper Guk, and only healed after the fight, so I don't get faction hits.  Why?  Not because I want the frogs to love me - but I simply don't want to get trained every time I go to lower guk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goldmoon</div><div class="date">02-05-2001, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">u make me laugh. Clerics are nearly impossible to solo so a nice spot is always a good opportunity.<br />

I love defending my friends in a group but sometimes soloing is so amazing cause it make me believe i can manage myself without anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niccy</div><div class="date">04-04-2001, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wanted to pop in here and say a big THANKS for this topic. This info is all SPOT ON   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I haven't soloed since about level 8 so I was naturally a bit nervous but it all went according to plan:<br />
<br />
Buff up with AoP AoF Reso RM RF Symbol (don't bother refreshing this, it's just in case the pet gets loose. Oh and not the peridot one, the old one   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif). Med up   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Root the pet, nuke Happ, stun Happ, nuke Happ - oh she's dead!<br />
<br />
&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=0&gt;&lt;font color=#ffff00&gt;You gain experience!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Root the pet again to stop it being silly, Atone it and wave /bye   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Oh look I've still got loads of mana left! Sit down and wait...<br />
<br />
6 minutes later - she pops! Nuke stun nuke her before she pets up and it's almost TOO EASY!!<br />
<br />
In fact, to be perfectly honest, I found myself feeling a bit guilty about how easy this was, especially when I had time to go to Mistmoore and res *between* spawns   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Gonna be planes-ready before too long...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">04-05-2001, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Happ Dremblenod to get through 44, 45, 46, 47, and 48, off and on.  She did not succeed in killing me once (got close a couple of times, but the Steamfont zone is reachable in 18 seconds while invulnerable).  <br />
<br />
To break the spawn, nuke Happ (always start out with a nuke, Happ only has 900 hps).  The pet will come at you.  Cast fear on the pet to make it run off.  Happ will most likely throw a nuke of some kind and then run up to do her dual 70s on you (pretty good punching for a mage).  Root her, back up, then throw a nuke to drop her.  The pet will suicide when fear wears off.  (Feared pets always suicide when fear wears off if their master is dead.)<br />
<br />
From then on just pay attention and nuke Happ before she gets her pet up.  It's the second or third spell she throws after she pops.<br />
<br />
With spawns every six minutes, a cleric can crank steady, safe experience solo and do stuff in RL in five minute stretches.  It'll be almost like having a life again.</div></div><hr />

I have spent in excess of 10 hours in DL trying to get 1 yellow bub in 45, very discouraging...I read this thread, went to LF, and am having the time of my life.  This is the easiest kill since bats at level 1.  I love it. I am flying through hell now...I would guess that its 6 or 7 kills per blue bub, which equates out to about 40 minutes per blue, or less than 4 hours per yellow. This, IMHO, is an excellent return on investment.  Thanks for the advice, and I can't recommend any place else better for clerics in lvl 45.<br />

Ah, heck, here is my stragtegy  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Nuke Happ<br />
Root Happ<br />
Nuke Happ<br />
:laughs at happ<br />
:looks at experience bar and rolls on the floor laughing with glee<br />

rinse and repeat<br />
...oh, and for all of those treehuggers who tell you its cruel to attack a helpless gnome, ask them when the last time they saw a lvl 35 mage bare-handed double hit for 70 dmg.  Or tell them that Happ is not well liked in Akanon, because there is no faction hit for killing her.<br />

<br />
I see the bar move with every kill.  I have been grouping here with my spouse's druid and she is also picking up some good exp.  I nuke and stun once, she does to of her dd spells and we have one dead happ.  <br />
<br />
It would better to do happ alone, but I enjoy being able to do other things in five minute stretchs while playing eq.  If one of us is away from our kybd waiting for the spawn, the other can take happ.  My wife's druid has yet to be aggro'd by anything in the camp when she nukes happ first.  Her druid is lvl 41 and almost 42 because of this spot.<br />

<br />
She is camped quite a bit, and when i come on to play, i am ready to invest some time. After finding out that she is camped, you can either come back later, or go find something else to do.<br />
<br />
I did the DL Skelly camp, which is almost never camped. I bound at KC, and would gate back every 30mins to get clarity/c2 and a new SoW.<br />
<br />
Soloing with clarity is too good, and you are never without it because there is always some enchanter at the north wall in DL. 54+ chanters for c2 are also pretty common.<br />
<br />
The only tough mobs there will be the greater plaguebones and the wraithbone champs, and whenever i got one of those spawns up there were a few things i could do.<br />
Usually a group on the NWall will kill the champs for you, just annouce it in OOCs and pull it to the wall for them. Or just train it somewhere and someone will kill it =P<br />

Finished 3 blues of 44 and now 2 blues into 45 in less than 2 hours....<br />

Looks like you could do 45 in about 15 hours or less here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lacuna</div><div class="date">08-16-2001, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember buff with FIRE resist and magic. she is a mage after all, a big huge majority of her spells will be fire.<br />
<br />
I camped her at lvl 44, 45 and 46. Off and on. Had fire resist to 180, and resisted about everything she threw at me. <br />
<br />
Don't worry about wearing your wisdom gear here, you are gonna use two-three bubs of mana to kill her and got 6 minutes to med, so why not put your resist gear on?<br />
<br />
Also, kill the spiders and wasps that wander around the area, they all walk in a triangle around the camp and are placeholders for named fairies and brownies. Get some charm animal potions.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

I said very little, not because of Happ, but because of Esquinellie the Corrupted.  She is an SK, that first HT is 401 damange, then she quad hits you for 115.  Luckily you can zone to SF, if you are paying attention.<br />
Worst thing is getting too lax here, and doing something away from the keyboard, only to come back and find yourself at your bind point!<br />
Oh well, happy hunting.<br />
