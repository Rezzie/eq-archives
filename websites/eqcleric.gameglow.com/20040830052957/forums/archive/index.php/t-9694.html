<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garryk</div><div class="date">10-20-1999, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the supposed advantages of the cleric class is that they can wear virtually any type of armor, which, in theory, should allow clerics to achieve an armor class comparable with plate-wearing melee classes such as warriors and paladins, and better than leather-clad rogues and banded-clad rangers and shamen.  Again, this is somewhat hypothetical since many of us choose to sacrifice AC for wisdom in order to increase mana.<br />
<br />
After completing two of the new cleric quests myself and browsing web sites for stats on other new cleric armor, I noticed that rogue, ranger, and shaman armor has higher AC by one or two points than cleric armor for ALL pieces of armor which I could compare.  Hrm...  what gives?<br />
<br />
Sure, clerics can wear plate, but by the time you can afford plate, you're better off buying platinum bars and completing the quests for armor that is (marginally) better than plate and cheaper.  Meanwhile, rogues, rangers, and shamen (and whatever other classes) are out there getting even better armor.<br />
<br />
And that's just for AC.  I don't even want to go into the disparity in stat bonuses between the classes...<br />

Been helping a bard and a ranger friend of mine to their quest as I do mine, theirs are more fun btw...  Get large groups together and go slaughter browneies giants go to lower guk etc.... we just sit on a stump and contemplate our toes or stare at a wall for 64 hours (Blasted Babbin and his misspawnsing placeholders).  And for proof that Verrant has issues... Paladin armor sucks as much as ours does!  and they have to go though even MORE BS!<br />
