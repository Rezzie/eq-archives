Killing the critters affects our faction in OT, and then we have nowheer to bank, buy/sell, etc.<br />
<br />
But these faction hits can be MANAGED.  This still doesn't work all that well, but combined with a lot of mindless berserker hunting (for whips), it can be done.<br />
<br />
The trick on the faction is that you will only suffer a hit if you are on the monster's hate list.  The easiest way to avoid being on the list is to do nothing in combat.  Cast heals AFTER combat.  Buff that Ogre warrior up to 3000+ and send him out into the fray with enough hits to last the battle without a heal.  When the monster is less than 10 seconds from dying, stand up and cast CH.  The monster dies, CH hits a moment later, and the warrior heads out to pull once again.<br />
<br />
Admittedly this will sometimes fail.  Often you will HAVE to stand up and intervene - it's your role in life after all.  It is also frustrating to be sitting there doing nothing during the battle, watching health bars drop.  But if you can pull it off (use massive buffs) then it works quite well.<br />
<br />
Also note that undead have no faction hits - just the drolvargs.  Get your puller to pull more undead  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
might as well just raise your cabilis faction and buy anything you need from OT in advance, cause what your describing doesn't seem practical imo. Cabby is a better place to bank anyways (convenience wise.)<br />

Should be possible, barely...just have to kill around 2000 goblins for it. :-)<br />
<br />
My troll warrior should have it a bit easier, but no luck sofar...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have yet to see any Donals, as the mobs that drop it are apparently really hard to pull to the zone and zone groups generally don't like to penetrate much.  I am trying to round up some stalwart souls and go in deeper, but haven't yet.<br />
<br />
As far as Cabilis goes, I agree it would be nice.  But raising 2500 bone chips is not my idea of a good time.  Someday.<br />
