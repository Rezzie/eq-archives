<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I correct that it drops in Kaesora?  If so, is it a drop off roughly any mob (or group of mobs) or does it drop from one specific mob?  And Kaesora is green to a group of 50+s correct?<br />
<br />
I've spent a lot of time in Chardok, but have had little success getting a Sarnak shield.  No luck on the lotto's from Naggy.  No luck on the lottos in Hate (I think I get the next Prismatic by default =P).  Just think it's time to upgrade the CGS (Aegis is on back).<br />
<br />
Any help you can give would be appreciated.<br />

The chance of getting a shield I would say, would be about equal to getting a forest loop off a random giant. As for everything being green that's mostly true, a lvl 50 group should have absolutely no problems in there.<br />
<br />
Oh one other thing I think there's a specific boss-type spider down there that has a really good chance of having the shield but the name escapes me right now.<br />

I'm one unlucky fella.  There is a named spider called the frenzied spider...his common drop is a mask...still haven't had enough coffee to remember what it is called.  Nothing special.  Supposedly there is a very rare fella (rumour has it he is a skeleton) that drops it pretty often.  Since I haven't seen him, I cannot confirm nor deny that.  Once I clear 46, I may go back and kill more spiders.  They go down real fast if you have a wizzie buddy to hang out with you.  1 nuke each and you can keep 12-15 spawn spots spawning.<br />
<br />
And reports are that ANY spider there has a chance to drop with the healers being more likely.  The shaman site eqforge.com had a fair amount of info a few weeks ago when I was trying for this.</div></div><hr />
