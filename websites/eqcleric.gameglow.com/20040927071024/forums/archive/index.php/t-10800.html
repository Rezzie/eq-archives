<br />
We pulled the giants into king, killed them all then moved in there to pull the terrors and spiders in the way.  The puller was over 53rd and gets ported out by vox without even looking out of the corner of his eye at her.<br />
So the monk (below 53rd) goes in and finds vox wandering the halls around her lair.  We all camp to break agg.<br />
<br />
Get back in, clear the mobs head by ramps.  Buff up camp out.  Everyone meets in chat we log back in and start up left ramp as one big group.  Before we can even get to the &quot;cleric rock&quot; Vox is on top of us.  Needless to say we didnt' make it<br />
<br />
Just seemed kind of odd that as soon as anyone moved past giants Vox started going nuts and wandering around.  &lt;shrug&gt;  But like I said, I'm not real experienced.<br />
