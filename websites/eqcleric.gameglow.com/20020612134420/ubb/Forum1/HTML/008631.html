</FONT><HR>"Cheal unbalanced the game"  I've seen it said to many times and in to many places to count them all.  I'm not so sure about it being accurate though because Verant has ways of dealing with CH rotations and they use them.  Area effect spell: Silence, Death Touch, Healer Agro/summon, Flurrying attacks; all are ways of a mob defeating or hindering a CH chain.<P>Snare on the other hand... in all it's forms, Snare/Ensnare, Bonds of Force, Darkness line of spells from Necro's/SKs.  Isnt snare the exact anti-RvR spell in all of EQ?  Consider... <P>With CH you have to have someone up close and personal with a mob.  Wouldnt be needed in any other way.  Someone is being attacked by the mob, thats Risk in RvR.<P>With Snare a mob (or mobs, depending on mob type and location) can be snared, player speed boosted and the mob can be killed with very little to absolute no risk at all.<P><BR>Seems very shortsighted of people to just say "oh, because of CH Verant broke the game and now everything has to be built around it with a bazillion hitpoints or AC" because when they say that they are referring to the singular boss mob at the end of a lot of killing to get to him.  Necro's might complain that Lifetap doesnt stick on Uber bosses, Druids that smaller heals arent effective on the amount of damage that uber bosses do, fine, but what about the 100 various minions of UberMob_03 you had to kill to get to him?  Lifetap hit all of them, they were all DoT'ed, they dont do more damage than what can be healed by smaller faster heals than CH, arent they all part of the same raid???  You dont get to walk into Fear and hail Cazic and attack.  Same for THO and The Deep and every other ubermob.   <P>I've also seen complaints that a certain number of clerics are required to do raids.  Well, duh!  Requireing a small legion of clerics to accompany melee into battle is hardly unbalancing or unrealistic.  Do we send our real world armies into battle without a medical battalion nearby?<P><BR>It's about time people start warming up to the fact that CH did not break the game.  It's a nice spell, it defines Clerics as a healer but it can not be worn like some shield of invincibility to protect your raid/group on their quest to uberocity.<P><BR>Random thoughts while stuck at work ;p  <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18964" TARGET=_blank>Grumbles</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>When was the last time you saw a resisted CH?<BR>When was the last time you saw a resisted snare?<BR>When was the last time you saw a raid say, damn, we cant do this due to lack of snarers?<BR>When was the last time you saw a person get resisted CH can not land in any way (you can remove the balance curse) message?<BR>When was the last time you saw a raid called of due to lacking druids or had a raid tell 3 people to log on their boot druids to make the raid happend?<P>CH is the bane and blessing for clerics. Due to CH so can we heal ALOT better then anyone else and are the only once who can stand up to healing on a boss mob but it also held above us as the reason to never get anything but nerfs due to the power of it. And no, there aint often you do dot up mobs because they mobs dont live long enough. And assuming you do dot them up so do you have 15 slots total for all debuffs and dots to land and a single necro can easy fill them (not counting for all procs with dot etc).<P>How many other classes ingame can you not do a raid if you only got 1 or 0? 1 warrior is enough, you can have paladins/SKs on rampage instead with right AA, slow can be done by enchanter, same with cripple. Manasong covers that, speed by song/shaman etc. But you can never, ever, replace the four clerics in the CH chain. Say we take druids as are the best direct healers short of cleric, say they use NTs 880hp heal. Say our average CH is 3k, that would mean ~3x the druids to heal at the exact same time as we would CH, but not only that, that only takes care of average healing. Sometimes mobs get a lucky run on hits + flurry and thet CH did 6k instead of healing, so now we need 7x the druids to do the healing. So now we are standing here with 28+ druids to do the job of 4 clerics and they all have to time it exactly and that is not accounting for the extra lag from it. If we take a normal raiding force so would we instead of having the average 44 people there so would we with druids healing have 68 people. Now that is quite a bump in lag. If you do the math on shamans so would it be even worse due to lower direct heal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>When was the last time your 1 warrior raid beat any mob bigger than The Va`Dyn?<BR>When was the last time your 1 rogue raid beat anything?<BR>When was the last time your 1 wizard raid beat anything?<P>I'm not sure if you would raid without a shaman but I wouldnt want to.  Sure Enchanters can slow, if it lands, but they have very low AC/hp's and often die extremely fast if they get agro, shamans usually at least have a glimmer of a hope of surviving the first melee round to be healed.<P>How many raids have I seen not happen because there was 0 or only 1 Druid?  none. how many do I wish we had a lot more than 1 or 2?  Lots!  Could have used the extra small heals to beef up the start of the cheal rotation, or to keep a tank up while agro was switched and a cheal chain started from mid battle, or to take care of heals on rogues and casters while the clerics are busy on the Warriors and Pallys or to heal someone off tanking adds/repops.  Dont sell NT short at 880 points, it's comparable to DL which every cleric still has memmed at L60.  <P>Also the point about snare was it's impact on RvR and "breaking" the game and not about how snare or the lack of a snarer affects a raid.<P>Bards on the other hand are the one class that seem to get the shaft the hardest when it comes to multiples on a raid.  <P><BR>-Grum<p>[This message has been edited by Grumbles (edited 05-26-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Lol, anyone who dont want multiple bards on a raid dont know what they can do...<P>I gladly tripple our regular 3 bards if I could (thx thx bard stacking code, 6x AoE mana song alone would rock, 25% haste over haste cap for the melee, dots, debuff, ds, dd etc... my god that would be a monster crew).<BR>And every druid you want to do patch healing would a cleric do more healing for less mana in shorter time. So you can replace all those druids you want with more clerics instead that would do the job better. Hence, if you had the choice of taking 3 druids or 3 clerics to do the job so would the clerics do it better (no friends etc in the choice).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>hehe didnt know the bard stacking bug was adding multiple AE mana songs, thats kinda sweet!  But that wont last forever =\<P>Sure, if you can only take 3 people and you've got 3 clerics standing there ready to go right beside 3 druids, who are you going to take for healing?  Clerics.  But nukes are nice to bring with, which the clerics can nuke but they are busy healing remember?  What about DoTs, any damage is nice on mobs when your clearing 100 things to get up to the boss.  What about circle buffs?  What about potg?  What about thorns? what about moving people to the next zone to kill the next mob?  You said not counting friends so I would assume you mean guildies also, but really, would you tell any guildie not to come with on any raid regardless of class?  Only time I ever would is if it would hose their faction, a Tunare worshipper on a PoG raid for example.<P><BR>This thread isnt a debate on the comparison of Druids vs. Clerics by the way, if thats what you want to do, start your own thread  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The thing is they deactivated snare on boss mobs....<P>CH still works.<P>However CH is our ONLY real definitive skill that makes us go from non-functional to god.<P>I mean what do we do on a raid?<BR>CH - ok, great<BR>DL - druids have similar<BR>CE - shaman have similar for non-tanks<BR>AEGO - You can get more hp using a different combo, and PoG will end up giving 6mana/tick more.<BR>Rez - OK were the best at this, but paladin comes close, and necro is actually better at this but requires sacrifices (necros can FD in camp)<BR>NUKE - resisted more then dru/mag/wiz...worse ratio. Definately not our calling.<P>So in otherwords deactivate CH and druids would pass up us in desireability...except for rez's.<P>Plus in regular groups the situation would continue....and for solo they aready blow us away.<P>The only difference would be YES. You would require them in larger numbers. That just would mean you would have 28 druids who can heal OR nuke OR evac OR snare OR DoT. Every exp group would have 3 druids, except the druids would probably still solo because they are so powerful solo.<P>Basically the world would instantly become overrrun with druids. Maybe 50% of the norrath population or more.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20365" TARGET=_blank>Citra Dangermouse-60 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20357" TARGET=_blank>Venerable Pilsburry Dangermouse-60 CLR</A><BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>VEESHAN</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The problem actually started out very early on in the start of Everquest.  Before all the expansions all the AA.  The ratio of Clerics to Druids was by far a smaller number everyone had a Druid they were by far the superior priest class at the time.<P>As the game evolved and expansions started to appear new challenges new spells, new skills appeared the Druid found themselves now in vast numbers and competing for the rights to a limited number of places as backup healers/DD on raids.  The cleric was also required here as the primary healer so always had a place.  Druids complained (had a bigger voice because of numbers explained before) and had many advantagous changes made to their class as a whole making them even more powerful outside the raid arena and somewhat more useful during raids.  Clerics on the other had didn't really have any major beneficial changes that actually made them more useful outside the raiding arena.  <P>Clerics today are the poorest class for solo play (AA exp really hasn't helped the clerics cause at all).  A cleric requires a Tank or Melee to kill mobs in most cases at an effecient rate bot other healer classes can solo very easily and probably get twice to three times the AA experience that a Cleric/Melee combo can get in the same time.<P>It is said that a cleric is the benchmark for the all priest classes well we might be the benchmark for healing spells but nothing else.<P>Druids seem to always complain about not being useful on raids but in essence this is the price you pay for the class you have chosen to play you get supreme solo ability but raids don't really require you all that much.  The cleric on the other pays the price for their high requirement in raids with the lack of ability to solo effeciently. <P>If I stood up and said out of all the healer classes if there was one class that I saw as slightly unbalanced it would be the shaman why you might ask well think about this-<P>1  A Shaman is pretty much mandatory now on raids the more the better (I think same dersireability as clerics)<P>2  The are quite able to solo very effectively<P>3  In many cases a shaman is more desireable in an EXP group than a cleric or druid (slows, heals, dots just can't be beat ask any warrior)<P>More and more I am finding myself grouping with friends during exp hunting and actually not doing much at all the melee never really take enough damage to warrant a heal and my nukes tend to get resisted a lot, if they don't they take so long to cast that I might get one off on a monster and then find myself interupting my second cast cause the monster is dead already.<P><BR>Saarem,<P>You only look at the one thing (druids not wanted on raids) what Grumbles was trying to get as was along the Risk vs Reward line you see a Druid can achieve large amounts of exp in a very short time with little or no risk at all.  Clerics have fallen well behind every other class for exp hunting since the expansion "Shadows Over Luclin" the AA abilities that are there are designed mo so for the Druids and the Shamans and not the clerics let me explain this:<P>What use is a Critical Heal on a complete heal? sure I can heal 21000HP but give me a tank with more than 8k and I will be very impressed.  For a Druid a Critical Heal on a NT means a 2 - 3k Heal which when you think about it is up with the clerics usual complete heal.<P>The sadest part for clerics is actually the class specific AA while all other classes get things that are very beneficial a cleric really doesn't get anything to right home about. Lets start a little post mortum here shall we: First the cleric Class AA:<P>* Mass Group Buff (Druids get this also)<P>* Divine Ressurection (100% exp rez only cast every 72 RL hours onyl good for rezzing self maybe)<P>* Innate Invis to Undead (Utterly Useless skill)<P>* Celestial Regeneration (Nice Heal of Time for No Mana)<P>* Bestow Divine Aura (bestows invulnerability to player has its uses (144Min Refresh However)<P>* Turn Undead (Due to casting times of this ability its only useful upto 2nd level and even then has issues namely finding undead of high enough level to kill for exp)<P>* Purify Soul (Cures majority of harmful effects again has only certain uses due to 72Min refresh)<P>* Spell casting Reinforcement Mastery (Druids get this also)<P>OK Now for the Druid Class AA<P>* Mass Group Buff (clerics get this too nice to have item)<P>* Quick Evacuation (at level 3 all evacaution spell 50% faster very nice indeed)<P>* Exodus (No Mana Instant Cast Evac Spell I see this being useful if a raid is going sour?)<P>* Quick Damage (Hmm Faster casting Nukes let me see Cleric nuke is 6 seconds for 925DD hmm Druid with this get a 3.5 second 1100DD abouts seems good to me)<P>* Enhanced Root (makes root/DD much easier now hmm Risk vs Reward I hear someone cry)<P>* Dire Charm (Oh permantly charm an NPC hmm now you have a high level PET umm RvR???)<P>* Innate Camouflage (innate invis any cleric would be happy just to get an invis spell much less innate ability)<P>* Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery (Cleric gets this also)<P>So as you can see the Druid AA is much more beneficial and useful to the class than the Cleric AA abilities basically to sum it up clerics GOT SCREWED with Luclin AA and you sit there an moan about not being wanted Blah Blah Blah all I can say is enjoy the freaking game and stop whining you got by far the better deal since the release of everquest and it seems are still getting it.<P>Sorry for the Rant I am just sick and tired of this arguement that seems to go on and on forever. <P>Anyway my two cents finished<p>[This message has been edited by Nazrin Wraithforge (edited 05-26-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I want druids to get CH so they can whine about how god-awful difficult their EQ life is and how verant hates druids and how they need summon corpse or slow.  Druids are the cushiest, easiest class to play!  Their tolerance for hardship is so low because of the ease of life being a druid.  No ability you give them will make them tolerate the slightest dependency in the game.<P>If a druid CH is introduced with 401 mana/10.1 cast time/99 range, they will roll around and gibber about how god-awful difficult their EQ life is and how verant hates them.<P>Nature's Touch is comparable to DL, and many act like it's worse than superior heal.  NT is superior to DL in cases when range is important (knockback fights).  But if it's not CH it's total crap to them.<P>Give them CH and res and everything, it won't stop them from complaining.<p>[This message has been edited by Gello (edited 05-26-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Naz, but druids are also complaining about their AA. Even paladins are complaining about their AA (that they got both Arch and therefor would be penilized to have to get more to be equal. Their current weekly argument).<P>I agree, cleric AA blow goats in the forest. Only reason I will get any is to get the new title. Same for mage (MGB and 1 group spell, DS) and necro (one group spell, Dead MEN floating, rare drop in Chardok, 49 spell). So saying clerics got bad AA aint exactly true, most non hybrids do.<P>You did not read my reply in another thread, I love to give druids CH. Why? because that would remove alot of preassure and burn out. There is a reason why EVERY uberguild is constantly looking for more clerics over any other class. Give them CH, I love to see them cry how boring it is in the CH chain. But if they get it so do I expect that clerics recive a huge buff in soloing/grouping that we lack now. And that is something I love, to stop having to have the CH hang infront of me everytime there is talk about balance and told you are to powerfull, you are to powerfull bend over for nerfbat. I love to be able just for once be able to bring my alt ranger to a raid instead of beeing told to log on my cleric because we are low on cleric this night and every other night.<P>Some clerics see the give away CH and see red screaming it is ours, it is ours go away. Well we lost everything else step by step, we where the only one to be able to exp ress, not anymore. We where the only once with group heals, not anymore. We still are superior to hp buff but that is a one cleric job at most with MGB and we got to sit in a CH chain on raids. I love to trade some of that need on raids for more soloing/grouping power that we lost. I love to be able to log on knowing that if there is a raid going to start so will there not be a DEMAND that I come to play...<P>Critical heal is the same as critical nuke or critical hit. Eyecandy. Sure it is nice for druids if they land it but they can in no way count on it. And it got some use but you never depend on it, nor do druids.<P>As for the druid class AA:<BR>Quick Evac, last time I evaced was something like 1 year ago.<BR>Quick damage, get bracer + ring. They cant do damage as they are usually healing due to lack of clerics so very limited use.<BR>Enchanted root, umm they quadd if they do exp not root and nuke. It only affects the druids nukes as well so very limited use.<BR>Dire Charm OF ANIMALS. How often do you find high level animals that is 46 but not higher and down? Kael, maybe WW if lucky, Chardok about the only times and that is assuming you want to deal with the pet pathing and they cant buff it...<BR>Innate invis, we get the vs undead and they get vs regular. We had other invis before so I dont see the big deal with it. Got some uses but how often do a druid run invis? I as cleric without snare/sow dont even use invis except the rare occasions I am running through Kael.<BR>Exodus, how often do you hear in a raid in Ssra EVAC EVAC!!! Most raids prefer everyone to die at the spot for ress in because it is faster...<P>So I say what I said before, give CH to druids, give clerics some real soloing power and not the earlier jokes. It would also stop the pointing of fingers that clerics got CH and is therefor balanced and should shut up, let the druids have to deal with everyone demanding them to come, let them deal with taking rampage damage in the CH chain (=.<P>Dangrim<p>[This message has been edited by Saarem (edited 05-26-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Complete Heal isn't the sole cause of the bazillion HP mobs.<P>It is the combination of Complete Heal + massive increase in the average tanks HP + massive increase in the quality of weapons available.<P>Pre-Kunark, CH really only healed 2k at the most (tanks just didn't have more HP than that). Thats a 5-1 HP/Mana ratio in the best possible case, and most of the time it was in the 3-1 to 4-1 range. A bit better than the fixed value heals, but not that extreme.... With 2000 mana a Cleric could reasonably expect to heal 6 to 8 thousand HP (assuming he lived long enough, the fight lasted that long, and not counting any mana regen). And, that tank he was healing might be lucky enough to be wielding a par of Yaks (you know - those 8 Damage 24 Delay weapons that even most newbie reject these days).<P>Fast forward to today : You can get your tanks to 6k+ HP. You can reasonably expect a high end raiding cleric to be healing 5k on each CH. That is a 12.5-1 ratio. 2.5x as much healing as was available from the exact same spell 2 years ago. At the same time, those tanks aren't using Yaks anymore. They have upgraded to truly sickening weapons with near 1:1 Dam/Delay ratios. They are doing more than twice the damage they did before (3 to 4 times as much if you factor in how much better the available haste is as well as the higher haste cap).<P>So, now we have clerics healing 2-3 times as wel as they used to and melees doing at least 3x the damage they did before...<P><BR>If there was no CH, the increased tank HPs wouldn't matter much - all they would do is provide a buffer so you would have more time to get the 'normal' heal spells off.<P>If HP inflation hadn't happened, CH wouldn't be any more efficient that before.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You still miss it Naxy...<P>If you go to a raid where you need a average of X CHers to make it happend. Not X CHers no raid, period.<P>Then you end with the simple fact:<BR>1. Not enough clerics (today) no raid. Any clerics online need to come regardless of what they planned etc. This leads to a big preassure on them and burn out.<BR>2. Due to burnouts and clerics changing class so will you have to constantly get more clerics (all guilds got clerics as high on wanted, most other classes are not... You would think that after 3 years they would got enough dont you?).<BR>3. Lack of clerics causes people to level up cleric boots only to be able to make raids. They also have to two boot or more on the raids (which in most cases means over all worse performance).<BR>4. Clerics will not get any upgrades because clerics got the strangle hold on raiding and refuse to let go. CH is the strongest spell in game and will with every expansion be even more powerfull as it is the only heal that scales (until tanks can go above 10.5k which with the current cap of 125hp / slot is impossible) with possible exception of slow (also scales but if you want to call it a heal or not I leave up for debate).<P>If druids on the other hand would recive CH so would that mean less preassure on clerics to be forced to show up to make the raid happend. If you wanted to bring a alt so would it not directly mean a big red flashing no sign. There would also be alot better ground for upgrades because what was hold as the reason to clerics beeing overpowered was removed and we could go long towards druids soloing power which many asked for. Clerics could fit also into other slots as to do the padding healing and assist healing of others, they could throw in nukes, melee etc due to the fact their mana was not needed to be conserved to the perfectness needed to last as long as possible.<P>There are druids who dont even want CH, and I dont blaim them. Getting CH is a heavy cross to bear and it aint really pure blessing as some thinks. I usually visit most class boards on a regular basis, when a cleric is brought up and the word balanced come in so is the general feeling that clerics are balanced/overpowered due to CH. This is from the regular players who dont get clerics in groups but we got a raiding spot and therefor so are we balanced/over powered. I dont think so, I dont think many on this board think so, but the fact is many do think so. And everything shown so far from VI says they also think so.<P>Dangrim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>OK, I know I am a bit slow (all this running around without a helmet and getting the head beat in), but one of the real problems pointed out here is that there are no more levels beyond 60. This means that for those level 60 with a bunch of AA points, killing mobs become easier and easier, but the mobs do not become green, regardless of how many AA points you collect (i.e. for xp grinding they don't move on to harder mobs). So a support class like the cleric is in less and less demand as tanks gain AA points.<P>I can see that it can be an issue in general on servers where more and more people reach 60 and the high end non-raid content starts to become old. And Planes of Power is a long way away....<P>Imagine the uproar if mobs would "go green" non only based on your level but also based on how many AA points you have?  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Naxy Dent, Templar of Oasis Covenant on Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well AA do help but I rather see the mudflation stopped (and no VI, NO MORE #¤=/=!)#/!"#=/ BANE WEAPONS!!!) by simply having SoV/SoL gear get a dent if you go to say RoK. So that SS armor is not giving you (made up) 300ac but same as Donalds 150ac for a complete set. That sword you got from Emperor is no longer 16/19 with a ton of stats and 90pt lifetap but 11/19 with a 10pt lifetap etc. Simply have a temporarly nerf on items to stop them from overpowering the easy zones (Seb etc) but still be slightly better then having the similar of RoK/best of RoK. It would still mean you be better but you would not be playing with frogs that barly touched you.<P>Of course it would be a programmers nightmare to try to do something like that (;<P>Dangrim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I agree, it is funny you mention those....Fear is actually a good grind with a 6man group.  We did it last week with Pal, Rng, Clr, Shm, Dru, Enc.

</FONT><HR>hmmm Druids  get NT a 880 hp heal DL is 900 <BR>both have roughly the same cast time and mana cost if you use a focus item.<BR>Clerics get an inate 10 percent heal bonus which is actually  a 10 percent penalty to druids /shammy<BR>so theres your 20 hp difference<P>Druids can fix that by  putting 3 aa lvls into healing adept<P>So really the only difference is NT has the same range as remedy. and DL is short range<P>Druids alread have better heal then our best non CH direct heal.<P>as far as CE vs topor , well i think shammys should get the neg effects of topor reduced some what but most shammys have already learned how to use this spell<P>Also remember that pre kunark except for CH all priests  had the same heals. I think they should just change topor to CE. Give DL the range it should have which should be the same as remedy.And leave the druids as they are. Give us a 2k-3k heal for 375 mana and about 8 sec cast time/no recast and give druids and shammys  a similar spell 2k heal for 500 mana 12 sec cast/30 sec recast  similar to some of the pally group heals that hve been added. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Pre-Kunark clerics were still better healers.  You have your info a bit incorrect.  Clerics had Superior Heal and Complete Heal and the other priest classes didn't.  Post-Kunark they gained Sup Heal and clerics had remedy, DL and CE.  Later on they added in chloroblast and NT, which basically left us with having 1 heal spell that no other class possessed.  Can ya guess it? ;-)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008631&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008631&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
