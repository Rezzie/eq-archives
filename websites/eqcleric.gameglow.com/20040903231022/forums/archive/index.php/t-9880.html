So if a pally has 190ish wisdom he has just as much mana as me, the cleric?<br />
<br />
Sure, his spells are one set below ours, but that's still a lot of mana.<br />
<br />
I think this definately makes the hybrids waaay more appealing then before, but not sure if it infringes upon the pure casters.<br />
<br />
concerns?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The patch was made so that hybrids don't have to suffer from double penalties (higher mana cost, smaller mana pool).<br />
<br />
However I can't think of one bad thing about them having a lot of mana... that's more power to us all as a group.<br />

Druids will never be replaced by rangers, <br />
<br />
Necros will never be replaced by SKs, <br />
<br />
Enchanters will never be replaced by Bards.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not too worried about it, in fact, I think it is a good thing, as the hybrids need a little bit of a boost.<br />

<br />
The patch gives hybrids a larger mana pool, yes. Hybrids are still hampered by a mana penalty to thier spells, and very few spell skills. I still dont see a hybrid replacing a caster anytime in the near future. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sphynkl</div><div class="date">08-11-2000, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The spells all take the same amount of mana where it be from a cleric or palladin.  I mean, Daring still takes 60mana regardless of class.<br />
So verant is saying that Palladins get some type of mana penalty?  I'm unclear as to how the penalty affects them I guess.  <br />
I mean it might be different if THEIR 'daring' costs 20 more mana or so.<br />
<br />
Maybe cleric's mana pool needs to be increase as well?  Oh but that would be back where we started I guess too.<br />

This penalty, as additional mana lost, decreases as they advance, but they always pay more to cast a spell than a Cleric would.<br />

<br />
Snare? Got that.<br />
Sow?  Got that.<br />
Tracking? Better.<br />
Nuking? Druids win.<br />
Total damage over long periods of time? Beat druids.<br />
Higher ac? Kinda even =P (rangers!)<br />
Evacs?  Who evacs anymore? =P<br />
<br />
Dunno about most people, but I'll take a ranger over a druid any day, unless I plan on going somewhere like CoM or Chardok.<br />
<br />
And don't mind me, I'm the only one in my guild above 40 without Jboots =)<br />
