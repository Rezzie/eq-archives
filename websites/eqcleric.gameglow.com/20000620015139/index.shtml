<blockquote>
I want to express my extreme disappointment concerning recent events that happened to a long time poster and moderator here, the Traveling Poet.  For various reasons, valid or not, his main character, a level 51 cleric named Dikmer became unpopular on the Xegony server in certain circles.  These things happen and are part of the game.  However, someone decided that wasn't enough and hacked into Poet's account, cleaning out all of Dikmer's equipment and cash in the process.  For Poet's own account of this see <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003195.html">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003195.html</a><br><br>Now in my opinion this is about as low as a person can go in a virtual reality.  Stealing a person's "virtual property" over a disagreement?  You are kidding me right?  Does not the perpetrator realize what a true, real life scumbag this makes him/her?   Does not the perpetrator realize that this crime is magnitudes worse a crime than the perceived injustice over the disposition of a semi-rare item?  Obviously not, but they should.  <br><br>If the perpetrator should somehow read this I have a little message for him/her:<br><blockquote>Please delete your account and seek medical help.  You have obviously completely lost perspective and are taking this game way too seriously.  Quit surfing EQ sites and seek medical attention. </blockquote>I am truly sad to read what happened to you Poet.<br><br>Rayne</blockquote></p>

I recently made a post to the Gameplay forum requesting a change to the resurrection engine.
