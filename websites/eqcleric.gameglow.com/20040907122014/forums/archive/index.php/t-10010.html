<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleki</div><div class="date">06-15-2002, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes another Ragefire stolen story:<br />
<br />
Set up is a the only Multi-Guild raid group left on RZ, who is ALL for helping the little guy. You know, those who are just coming of age at 46+ and never been to a plane or some other dungeon deep in...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the raid group had been camping Ragefire for about a week (stupid patch) so had to restart after the patch, so Mr. RF pops up on a early Sat morning 6/8 to be exact. <br />
<br />
Well, we get the forces together (some outside help too) and commence to attack RF, being that this is a PvP server it is a FFA camp mostly, with whoever can take it, take it. (meaning us little guys get left out alot)<br />
<br />
Anyway, we get RF down to the &quot;O&quot; in Zordak, when along comes the group, lets call them &quot;Wudan&quot;, with their ubber 60s with but load of AA points and manaburn wizzies.<br />
<br />
At this point, we had lost about 3/4 of our group, but still had the 3rd MA up and few more.<br />
<br />
Well against 3 MB wizzie's they took it, let their lvl 60 Cleric loot.<br />
<br />
NOW mind you!!!<br />
<br />
Their &quot;cleric&quot; and I use the term loosely, HAD NOT, I repeat, HAD NOT even started his epic!!!!<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
/cry<br />
/gloom<br />
/pout<br />
/RUDE Verant<br />
<br />
Explain to me, how can you make an epic that can be started at the VERY end, so that ANYONE can loot, be called Epic???<br />
<br />
I am a 58 Priestess, with over 2yrs into the Game, Been Epic ready for 8 months now, all save for stupid Ragefire. The other cleric who is in my raid group (we make up 2 of the 5 leaders) she is lvl 60 and been Epic ready for a year now!!!<br />
<br />
So nice to see that any joe shmoe can come in, KS an &quot;epic&quot; mob and loot it, and not EVEN have started his/her epic yet.<br />
<br />
WOOT! WTG Verant!!! Err or is that WTG Alan??<br />
<br />
Bleh</div></div><hr />

isn't KS'ing against VI policy on PvP servers?<br />

On the Rathe, when blantant KS'ing is done, the GM's rectify the situation.</div></div><hr />

We had RF blatantly KSed from us once. We had reports submitted of us aggroing first, us getting exp on the human form, us aggroing the dragon first. Sent in petitions, even emails and they didnt do anything about it<br />

Quite honestly, I haven't even thought about it because of the horror stories of the RF camp.<br />
<br />
I consider myself a n00b at times still concerning EQ and in PC gaming.  But as detailed as this game is, I would think that they could make a change. ie: If you do not have the pearl you cannot loot the container.<br />
<br />
Not that exactly, but something of the sort.  This would prevent clerics (such as myself) who have not done the majority of the quest from looting, and also, any other class from trying to loot for a possible MQ.<br />
<br />
As I said... maybe not my idea exactly.. but I am sure they could do something to regulate this a bit more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magada</div><div class="date">06-16-2002, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This sucks, it really does, and of course the other guild would have to justify, but let me remind you of something...<br />
<br />
The reason Ragefire was moved to skyfire, and not made into a turn-in mob was to protect clerics and their hard work. Okay I know that doesn't make sense, anyone can come in and KS the dragon even if they are level 1, etc. However, back in the solb days, there were guilds who would camp solb rage for days upon days and wait for naggy to die so the cleric could hand in the item and get the dragon to spawn. This should make the dragon theirs right? WRONG. Guilds had been known to lurk behind the other guild, bring in their forces once the item had been turned in and take down the dragon. Granted this is a very blatent KS and I'm sure GM's took care of many of the situations it wasn't foolproof. Now if you were the cleric in that situation, would you be more upset if A. you lost everything you had done in your epic beforehand and had to do it ALL over again, all the long camps, all the trips to Chardok, spawning that firegiant in the middle of burningwoods, ALL over again. Or would you be upset for a bit, think it was unfair, and just sit and camp the one single same mob again?<br />
<br />
Yeah, in some ways skyfire rage sucks, first of all it's a bit easier to KS unless you have agreements among the bigger guilds on the server, second of all, any cleric can do it, heck, any character can do it. BUT it is a step in the right direction to make it a bit more fair for clerics. The major problem with it now is just the timer. There really is no way to make ragefire pleasant at all. That is part of why it's an epic, there are challenges, whether it be ksing guilds, grumpy clerics, you name it. As one who had her own trials and tribulations (why I'm so animated on ragefire topics) I can say that every time I've struggled for a part of it that should have come easy made holding that stick that much sweeter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naosu</div><div class="date">06-17-2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry to correct you, Mag, but the reason why RF was moved to Skyfire had nothing to do with the clerics at all.  It had to do with the GMs having to reimburse a KSed cleric with their pearl because of the screwy turn-in that happened in Naggy's lair.  The GMs complained that they were doing way too much CS handling and too many pearls were getting reimbursed. They moved RF to Skyfire *without* a pearl turn-in so they could wipe the GM's hands clean of the situation.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to is now the GM's decision on what to do when a random-spawn mob pops and is KSed or ninjaed.  On apathetic servers such as Bertoxx, the GMs let whoever *looted* the heart keep it unless impossible proof is given in spades (multiple screen shots, /reports, /petitioning before and after the kill/engagement, etc.).  On other servers, things are handled as the GM sees fit (reimbursing KSes, ninja-loots, etc.).  Basically the response will be as random as the spawn-time itself.   The rules are there are no set rules, so proceed at your own risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balamor</div><div class="date">06-17-2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with what Naosu said. They moved RF to skyfire so GMs would never have to replace pearls again and hoped they wouldnt have to be involved much.<br />
<br />
Just last Friday, there were 2 guilds in skyfire camping RF because he was due. GM(s) showed up and said to everyone that if anyone petitioned about RF, everyone in the zone would be given a warning on their account. Believe it or not, that is what the GM said...<br />

Thank god I don't have to do that work.<br />
<br />
According to my friend on Legends, they don't have the 24 hour service from GMs they used to have due to &quot;recruitment issues&quot;. This on a premium paid server. <br />
<br />
Can you envisage GMs totally sick of idiots, moving on to new games companies? /sigh<br />

<br />
Guys, let's put this into perspective.  Verant screwed up with their system of guides and GM's in the first place.  GM's and Guides are SERVICE people.  You pay to play this game.  These people are paid to make certain that your playing experience goes according to the rules.  These people should have all the authority of a tech support person, and should be in the same queued system.  No GM or Guide should have an area of authority where they can play favorites.<br />
<br />
Guides and GM's ARE paid to deal with idiots, just like the guy behind the counter at any store, or any tech support person, and they'd better give their service with a friendly smile and a willingness to go the extra mile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are guide programs run by Verant where they let new guides know what they can and cannot do, what they may and may not do. They are not paid, Guides are players like you and me, who are playing on another server than the one on which they are Guides.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cland</div><div class="date">06-25-2002, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm, I don't remember this, Seeing how I am from Wudan and the last time we did RF it did goto a cleric who hadn't started his epic, but heres the story from what I heard in GC, I logged in halfway through it.<br />
<br />
So I log on and I see a bunch of naked Guildmembers in the Bazaar, aparently RF is up, gah, okie, so I get ported to SF with a bunch of other people we goto some random place in the zone (cause RF is wandering at this point) and send our bard to go fetch it, he pulls it in, we kill it.  AJ is givin the heart (don't know if our Guild leader knew he hadn't started it or not) but AJ is givn the heart because he has been on the most raids latly (more than me actully &lt;wince&gt;)<br />
But let me make it very clear that when I came (I was there for the killing) and when RF droped yall were not there (I know I was meleeing him) Of course theres three sides to this argument my side, your side, then the truth.<br />
I'm sorry you didn't get your epic, its no big deal honestly, it happens almost everytime he spawns on some server.<br />
<br />
You say you've been playing for 2 years.  Let me give you a little history on who got this RF in question, I started my character in November of 1999, When I was level 10ish, I got to wondering what the cast time on Complete heal was, asked the only level 40 cleric I could find about it, it was &lt; gasp &gt; AJ <br />
<br />
Sorry, but RF is not a horrbly difficult mob he has 50k hps is slowable and his AE is the same as lord nagithin.  Yes I'm from a big guild, yes I have my epic, did I have my pearl when I killed him? No, did AJ? no, did we both have our epics within a week of killing Ragefire? You better believe it.<br />

<br />
Hahahaa<br />
<br />
Sorry, I d like to laugh a bit longer but what a waste of time, ye know.<br />
<br />
You forgot a few real important facts. <br />
You might want to add that:<br />
<br />
- you hade 3 peps left in zone<br />
- RF wasnt agro anymore but running around   zone regening<br />
- we killed RF is a completely other area of the zone than you guys were (rotting slowly)<br />
- RF was back at full health when we engaged (or even better when he decided to agro us)<br />
<br />
You know I rather see RF dead than despawned and by the speed you guys ressed, man, bet you would still buff right now.<br />
<br />
You had your chance, you failed. Better luck next time. We didnt interfere with your fight neither did we KS. You fought. You lost. We took it. Whats your problem ?<br />
You should thank us for saving you from another whipe...pfft, I better stop or I lose my temper.<br />
