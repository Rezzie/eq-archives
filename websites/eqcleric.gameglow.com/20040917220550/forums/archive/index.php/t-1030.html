Near as I can tell, High Elves, Dwarves, and Dark Elves are all fairly common choices for various reasons.  Slightly less common are the Humans and Halflings, and I almost never see an Erudite or a Gnome wearing cleric garb.  How many of you are out there?  What made you decide to play the race you chose?  Do you have any tales of finding a group and having to convince them you're really a cleric?  Do tell  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
These folks are all good-aligned as far as I know, not sure about any of the new evil Erudite clerics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sal</div><div class="date">09-02-2000, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gnomish cleric here. One day in the Frontier Mountians myself and a Barbarian Rogue were looking to join a party.  On the way to meeting our new partners the rouge goes LD. I get there and they ask &quot;where's the cleric?&quot;  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
 Not as often now, but I used to get this alot &quot;Wow I didn't know Gnomes could be clerics.&quot; <br />
<br />
 Just last week I was at the Bazaar in the Commonlands sitting at the tunnel entrance listening to the auctions for anything interesting. When all of the sudden a wood elf druid that was near me says &quot;Gnome Cleric!&quot; wich draws some stares, and remarks from surrounding buyers, and sellers. Some even expressing pity for me, as if I am some cripple! I found this most amusing since these beings were druids and necromancers, and their opinions for the most part mean little to me.<br />
<br />
 Being a bit of an... ahmem... oddity does have its benifits. People tend to remember you more readily then say Dwarf Cleric X or High Elf Cleric Y. Not that there's any thing wrong with those clerics, espicially fellow followers of the mighty Duke of the Underfoot. Oh here I go rambleing again, but needless to say being a Gnomish Cleric is not the life of a cripple as some would have you think, but rather a challenge that the Duke has set before us Gnomes that I have answered.  <br />
