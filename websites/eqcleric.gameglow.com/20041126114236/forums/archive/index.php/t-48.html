As we all know Undead Grimrot spawns a little too rare right now.  I also know most of you already have your Aegis and really could care less about it now...  It would be nice to get Abashi or someone to look at this problem.  I've had my Faction and Scythe for awhile now and camping Undead Grimrot everyday for 20 hours for a month isn't my idea of worth it.  Please support this thread-- Thanks<br />
