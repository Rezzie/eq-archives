<br />
I would call us mostly like a smaller, close guild, however we have raiding aspirations.   We raid 3 days a week, and attendance is not mandetory however, we would like people to raid.   The other 4 days are completely free.<br />
<br />
We're not an uberguild, we're not going to see everything on the server, but we do want to move forward as much as we can.<br />
<br />
Recently we've killed Vindi, Klandicar, and Telk in WToV... just to give you a rough idea of our strength.<br />
<br />
We've proven again and again that we're not afraid to try something out, and if our asses get handed to us, so be it, we'll try again later with a better strategy or a few more good people.<br />
<br />
This is not a free invite... anyone who thinks this might be the place for you, would have to go through the normal recruitment process.<br />
<br />
I would say we're pretty low stress, have some nice helpful people, and we want to smack around as many mobs as we can... if you think maybe that's the place for you... feel free to stop by our boards or website, and say hi.<br />
<br />
In game I'm Wispr, or you can talk to any of our great recruitment officers... Moonstarre, Kuadine, and Tabbitha.<br />
