<br />
I would like to try and start collecting gems for the Velious armor quests.  I have some information that the gems for our Quests drop in the following zones:<br />
<br />
Cobalt Scar<br />
Icewell Keep<br />
Velketor's Labyrinth<br />
Siren's Grotto<br />
Dragon Necropolis<br />
Wakening Lands<br />
<br />
Now since I am going with D&amp;D faction (at this time I don't think I'll ever see ToV), Icewell Keep is out, correct me if I'm wrong.<br />
Velketor's - Don't know anyone that knows anything about this zone and how hard it is to get gems here.<br />
Cobalt Scar - Just recently got a key..maybe this is worth a shot?  Anyone know what I should be looking for to get gems?<br />
Siren's Grotto - Don't think we can do this at this time.<br />
Dragon Necropolis - Um..no.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
Wakening Lands - What should I look for here that has gems?  Only time I have seen any was off of some Giants that were triggered spawns from a Mage focus item quest.  I lost the rolls.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

Icewell Keep - It's safe to hunt there as long as you hunt in the monster part and not up top killing dwarves<br />
Velk's - Good zone, can grind in there pretty well, not sure how common gems are really<br />
Siren's - Tough as nails zone...<br />
Necropolis - Tougher than nails...<br />
Wakening - Sifaye, Sent armors, giants, etc. all drop gems</div></div><hr />

<br />
Icewell Keep dwarves don't drop quest gems. Creatures in the pit do however. The tough part about DN is getting there...</div></div><hr />

Well to be honest Icewell was a very dificult zone for me and my group but then again we only had one group..<br />
<br />
49th warrior<br />
53rd druid<br />
52nd enchanter<br />
45th cleric (me)<br />
54th necromancer<br />
52nd paladin<br />
<br />
We started by zoning in under the bridge.<br />
<br />
Headed down the path, and got a two cube pull..<br />
<br />
Mezd one waxed the other.. literally he spent 2 minsutes taunting and begging (cause begging is a type of taunt) the hell out of the cube, but soon as he went to attack it, the cube went straight for the chanter.  He dropped, then the pally dropped, then we zoned.. So Icewell is dificult to say the least (well at least for our group it was)..<br />
<br />
Umm another good spot is in Cobalt Scar off of the ottermen.. Just harmony(lull) pull them and take em out that way...  They drop crustacean armor ( + tons of stamina) and gems.. so its up to you...<br />

<br />
Anyway, we were camping spiders (Hunters, broodlings and such) and dogs.  I did get one BP gem (woot!) and we got a priest class arm gem and several other gems.  We were there for 2-3 hours.  Not bad!</div></div><hr />

Only thing to be careful of, is don't let anyone who wants to do the Phenocryst focus quest hunt with you while you kill them, and try to get a lookout in case some invis person turns in their items for a focus, and you get treated to a train of 12+ geonids....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">04-25-2001, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, as dumb as this sounds…<br />
<br />
I currently have:<br />
<br />
4 Nephrites<br />
4 Jaundice Gems<br />
2 Crushed Opals<br />
3 Chipped Onyx Sapphires<br />
1 Crushed Flame Emerald<br />
1 Crushed Flame Opal<br />
1 Crush Lava Ruby<br />
1 Flawed Sea Sapphire<br />
5 Flawed Emeralds<br />
<br />
And guess how many I got killing stuff?<br />
One. A Crushed Opal off a spider in Velk's<br />
Lab (kinda surprised by that too).<br />
<br />
Every single other one was either traded<br />
off another player, received for a rez or<br />
purchased from a vendor.   Actually, the<br />
2 Traded from another player kinda came from<br />
a vendor too (1 Jaundice and 1 Chipped Onyx<br />
Sapphire), because I traded him a Monster<br />
Summoning II for the two gems and I got the<br />
spell (and another copy of it and 2 other Mage<br />
spells) off the otterman vendor in CS.<br />
<br />
But the others I have purchased, mostly from<br />
the Othmir vendors, and some others from<br />
vendors in Thurgadin (best place to shop for them<br />
is the vendor in the building straight in from the<br />
entrance.  Or the ones in the bank.  Or the<br />
guy with the food.  Sometimes the Bartender at the<br />
bar more or less just outside the zone to Icewall Keep).<br />
<br />
Of course, this takes some digging, but it is worth it<br />
as not only do you get these gems, but I have found<br />
several diamonds, Black Sapphires and spells to<br />
sell too!<br />

Then someone gave me a Jaundiced Gem for a res the other day.  I was told I NEEDED it.  (I happend to be one of the clerics that will take what people want to give me for a res.  I only charge for one when I'm feeling grumpy.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif)<br />
<br />
Is there someplace on this site to find out more about these quests, or would like Alakazam's be better?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.<br />

Head to the Kobold section and go berserk. Lots of gems and decent xp, (atleast up too approx 55). Velketor's drops gems that all the classes need.<br />
