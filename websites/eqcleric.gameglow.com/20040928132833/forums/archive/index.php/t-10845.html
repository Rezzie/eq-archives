<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-18-2001, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A month ago a reference was made to a thread on a Bard site that people who chose Dragon faction would be pleased they had done so.  See http://pub5.ezboard.com/ftheconcerthallbackstage.showMessage?topicID=9004.topic <br />

I took that to mean that there would possibly be drops other than armor blanks to justify the time there.  I'm wondering if that was an assumption on my part or if we just haven't done enough of the wing successfully yet to see the items.  Last night we killed our first named (some level 60 Drake Warrior) who dropped a Flame Kissed Tear.  We were getting ready to pull the second one when we aggro'd TOO MANY mobs. Apparently the South Wing has wanderers in addition to the North Wing =P.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exeter has gotten better at Summoning Corpses 249.&quot;<br />
<br />
Is there anything that drops in this wing besides armor and quest items or do we just need to kill more stuff?  Doesn't really matter, but I keep seeing those nifty items out of the North Wing on the Eq'Lizer =P.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

We have had several good nights (a few BP) and several nights of Bad roamer adds, wipeouts, and 3-5 drops.<br />
<br />
Tracking classes with range sort is VERY handy, as are 2-4 FD pullers.<br />
