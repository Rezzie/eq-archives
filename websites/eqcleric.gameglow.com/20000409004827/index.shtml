I was hoping that my next post would be the announcement of the Data Patch (it is supposed to fix our quest armor and increase Hate drops), but alas that is delayed.

Needless to say Abashi responded that it was intentional.  My own take is that at higher levels use those spells as anti-taunts and use Gate or wait for the Evac to escape safely.<br><br><br><br><br></blockquote></p>

Having a really hard time discovering anything Cleric related, but found this post from Gordo today:<blockquote>**some complaint about drop rates***<br><b>Just trying to verify your logic: The drop percentages in Hate are low so people with armor in Hate will play longer? I suppose that means that since the drops in Fear are higher, we must want everyone with armor there to quit. <br>Please...

<blockquote>
Below is the complete patch:<blockquote>***TODAY'S PATCH***<br><br>This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to improve performance of the game engine in general.  No items, spawns, spells (with the exceptions below), etc., were changed as a result of this patch.  <br><br>- Area Effect "Fear" spells will no longer work in PvP.  This affects a bard song, as well as the Cleric "Wave of Fear" spell.<br>- Corrected a bug with some of the Resurrection spells that caused them to return too little experience. <br><br>We plan on publishing data and item changes next week if all goes well on the Test server.  We apologize to those who are inconvenienced by having to wait for the expected changes.<br><br>-The EverQuest Team</blockquote>The issues with the Resurrection line returning variable experience has been documented for so long that it's been forgotten (or at least I did).  This was a welcome change.  Too bad about the quest armor, but at least they are officially making a committement for next week.<br></blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
On the 9th of this month I posted a question on Everquest's Gameplay Forum querying why the Warhammer of Divine Grace did not possess stat modifiers when the other two priest specific dragon drops both granted +9 Wisdom.  Here is Abashi's response:<blockquote><b>No one ever said that all items dropped by creature X would be carbon-copies of each other for all classes involved. This is true for Dragon Loot as well for common-drops. The critters in Kithicor drop a pretty nifty cleric item as I recall, and other classes aren't necessarily represented. That's just the way it is. Balanced != Identical<br>-Gordon</b></blockquote>Here is the link to the <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum4/HTML/024777.html">entire thread</a>.<br><br>For the record, the Kithicor weapons are typically usable by: War, Clr, Pal, Shd, Rng, Dru, Mnk, Bard, Rog, Shm.  At least the Ruined Battleworn Morning Star I grabbed from an Undead Trooper is.  Kind of a shame when I get a better item of a run of the mill mid 30s mob in Kithicor than I could get from Lady Vox.<br><br>As for when the quest armor will finally be upgraded on the live servers, here's another "gem" from Gordo:<blockquote><b>Actually I admitted 3 patches ago that it looked wrong and that we'd look into it. 2 patches ago I admited that it was fixed on test and would go live the next time we patched data. We haven't patched data since then.<br><br>We should be patching data next week.<br><br>-Gordon</b></blockquote>Only problem with that this isn't the first time he's said next week.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
March 21st, 11:00am<br>-------------------<br>***UPDATE MESSAGE***<br><br>This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to improve performance of the game engine in general. However, there are several changes to note:<br><br>*Spell Changes*<br><br>- Skin Like Nature has had its damage shield removed and has regained its regeneration component. We're certain this time :)<br>- Many Shaman buff spells have had their recast delay removed. You can now cast them on multiple people without having to wait between each cast.<br>- The Wizard spell "Rend" was improperly saving versus cold. It now saves versus Magic. <br><br>*Bug Fixes and General Enhancements*<br><br>The spawning problem in Solusek's Eye (SoldungA), related to the spawn of the Clockwork gnomes, will be fixed later today in a zone patch. <br><br>The +/= key will no longer take screenshots. <br><br>You can now adjust your clipping plane by using the SHIFT/- and SHIFT/+ key combinations. <br><br>You can now view the Message of the Day by typing /motd.<br><br>Corrected a bug in the /follow process that would cause your character to loop around to the right at times when following someone.<br><br>Corrected a bug that would cause item-loss associated with trading a container marked LORE Corrected some grouping bugs that had the potential to cause the client to crash. <br><br>*Feign Death and Pets*<br><br>The Feign Death spell will no longer wear off. This change had been made due to an issue that was discovered that allowed Necromancers to solo creatures while feigned and AFK. The change had some unintended effects, as we discovered that there are a few cases where someone could be legitimately feigned for a longer period. Instead of having the spell wear off, any summoned pet will automatically suicide 2 minutes after its owner feigns. This is the solution requested by most of the players who voiced an opinion, and should serve the same goal as the original change.<br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
Spent an evening doing respawns (wasn't SUPPOSED to be respawns, but that's another issue entirely =P).  The haul was:<ul><br><li>3 Warrior Whips (from the Amy's)</li><br><li>2 Cryosilk Sleeves (from phobo's)</li><br><li>Bard Bracer (from phobo)</li><br><li>Warrior Shield</li><br><li>Druid Arms (from phobo)</li><br><li>Monk Tunic</li><br><li>Monk Bracer</li><br><li>SK Bracer</li><br><li>Girdle of Diligent (woohoo)</li><br><li>Blighted Gloves</li><br><li>Shaman Belt</li><br><li>Ranger Arms</li><br></ul>So I count 15 drops in the six hours I was there.  It is important to note that this was a haul of the <b>respawns</b>, not a fully spawned zone.  For example, we did not see one Gorgon (or I missed her if she showed).  There were very few Fetid Fiends (3 of each gender).<br><br>I'm thrilled with the Fear spawns, just disappointed with the ratio compared to Hate.</blockquote></p>

<b>Player asks</b>:<br><blockquote>But clerics are a holy class, just as much as Paladins. So where is our holy weapon? Where is the wizards class-defining staff? Where is the rogues backstab-o-matic dagger?</blockquote><b>Abashi answers</b>:<br><blockquote>They are out there, but really haven't seen the fanfare of the Fiery Avenger. People will know when they find them.</blockquote>Well, it's time to get crackin people =P.<br></blockquote></p>

Or Disgrace as some have named it =P.<br><br>I have a post on Everquest's Gameplay forum questioning the stats from this particular dragon (Vox) drop.  If you can just monitor on occasion; I would hate to see this fall by the wayside.  Yes, it's a minor issue, but then again the solution is also minor.<br><br>Also, there is a thread out there on the Aegis of Life.  This too should be kept alive until we receive some response.

A bit belated, but reports on this are coming in from various places.  What I've seen reported are these figures:<br><blockquote><br>Bracers:     9<br>Vambraces:   11<br>Gauntlets:   12<br>Breastplate: 20<br>Greaves:     13<br>Boots:       11<br></blockquote><br>The stats appear to have been left the same, which is a little bit dissapointing, but the AC increase is very nice and makes it desirable to become a "Golden Boy" (or girl).  Also, no adjustments have been reported to the weight.<br><br>If anyone on test could send some screenshots I'd happily post them.<br><br></blockquote></p>

And it's called <i>NewsPro</i>.  This program makes it easy for lazy people (e.g. me) to add news.  In the past I had to go through a number of steps to update the news (e.g. fire up Front Page, load the Index.html file, copy/paste text, change the text, save, upload).  Now I go to a web page, enter some text, hit Submit and I'm done.  Needless to say I'm pretty excited about this.  In fact, I like it so much that I'm putting this into the News section, which hardly qualifies (I'll remove it once I put some real news in).<br><br>Have a nice day.</blockquote></p>
