I got the Reed Belt and was wondering what is is realistically worth in trade.  As uncommon as it is, I Know I would want something nicer stat wise. (More than +5 wis)  What would be fair if I was trading it to someone much higher than myself? (i.e. someone who has cool stuff to get rid of, that I can't get for a long time)<br />
