I got a wopping total addition of 2ac.  whoopee. Is the AGI stat to cleric as useless as it appears? Someone told me it may be included in defence some other way.<br />

Agility also helps us when casting spells.  The higher your agility is, the less likelihood of being interrupted we have.  So a cleric who has High AGI, and one with Low AGI are in similar situations being whacked.  The Higher AGI cleric has less chance to have his/her spell interrupted.<br />

Why don't you use all Agility items and cast minor heals instead of superior heals cause that's all the mana you will have!  But you wont' get interuppted so hell it's worth it right?  Dude, screw agility (unless you find a wisdom item with agi too), wear wisdom giving items until you hit 200 wisdom, then start replacing some with high AC armor instead.  The extra mana will mean more to the life of you or your group than you not getting interupted once or twice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khamrynn</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Supposedly there are two types of factors when determining your ac, damage avoidance and damage absorption. Your character ac heavily leans on damage absorption I believe. Basically agi and some spell effects aid in damage avoidance in that the mob would have a greater chance of missing you. While armor and straight ac buffs usually deal with armor absorption in that when you are hit, it's for less total damage on average. Your defense skill I think is the most important factor when determining your actual defense ability though. <br />
<br />
Also there's the deal of threshold numbers for your stats. At 75 and 100 you get a large bonus for that specific stat. So someone who raises their agility from 97 to 99 won't get that big of a bonus in AC compared to someone who raises it from 98 to 100. <br />
<br />
Shamans did a bunch of testing on this when their stat buffs usefulness came into question. I think they basically said that stats really don't do a heck of alot aside from wis and int (chr for enchanters and bards). While dex, agil and str do help in some regards, the amount they provide is miniscule. Although I haven't done any statistical analysis of it, it does seem like a shaman agility buff really helps out my damage avoidance alot, also str on a rogue is amazing when you see their backstabs. <br />
<br />
One other thing our spell Shield of Words supposedly has some other defense factors built in. I'm not sure if it was GZ himself who said this or just a rumor that was started. I don't remember if it was that it raised our defense skill or just upped our damage avoidance along with the +6 ac raise over aof. I should go test this on ping fizzlecutter later.<br />

Although I am not quite sure why you lashed out, I can address one thing.. at nowhere in the post was it stated that we should sacrafice wis items for agility, and then if someone were, it is their choice afterall.<br />
<br />
And it is true that when you have a high agility, you get interrupted less, and amazingly enough, you can have a semi decent agility score and cultivate a high wisdom also.<br />
<br />
Agility supposedly helps out with AC, and the less I get hit, the less either I have to heal me (if soloing) or the less my party has to worry about me while in a big combat.<br />
<br />
Before lashing out, take a step back, breathe, than start to type... I'm sure your message will come out much less abusive.<br />

<br />
Personally, I like the fact that I RARELY get interrupted on anything with a casting time of &lt;gheal, and maybe 15-20% and sheal, and I NEVER EVER cast CHEAL when I'm being beaten on.<br />
<br />
Agi is actually useful, trying being midfight when a 51st shaman hits you with an agi buff, it makes a difference.<br />

Thus the quest gauntlets are better than EM Gaunts because quest adds agi,while EM has dex (the AC is the same)the only exception is for dragon raids since one has fire and the other cold <br />

Was just having fun with my good cleric friend (who I won't name, hehe).  He is on an agility kick, and I am just trying to point out to him that he needs to keep his wisdom up....He didn't state it in the message but here is what he was going to do.  Replace his 6wis rings with Djarns Rings and replace his Cleric bracers with Serpentine Bracers.  Bam, there goes 24 wisdom for a few AC and some missed attacks. =D   Did not mean to sound that offensive oh high cleric sir.  Clerics rule!</div></div><hr />
