<br />
I was in a Trak raid last week and we were doing fine (got to about r in Trak) until Trak suddenly wandered off towards the bridge where he chewed and spit out a lone cleric standing out of AE range healing partymembers.<br />
After chewping the cleric, he then gated back to spawn point.<br />
<br />
Can you say wipeout?</div></div><hr />

I think my most fun Trakanon kill was when the paladin charged in to position Trak said &quot;WTH is he?!?&quot;. We obviously all ran into the lair too - and a couple of minutes later Trakanon charged us. <br />
<br />
Seems he had been a trip to the Shroom maze for some reason - he did kill the 2 afks on the beach on the way back anyway. I think we even let him run and gate too before we got around to killing him.<br />
