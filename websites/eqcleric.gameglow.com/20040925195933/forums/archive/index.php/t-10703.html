<br />
We went up to PoH on friday again, but this time we was not as successful as the last time.<br />
<br />
Trains....LOTS of trains, and i aint talking about 4-5 mobs here...<br />
<br />
Once we pulled a Cleric of Innoruuk...20 secs afterwards we got 2 Loathling Liches, 3 Ire Ghasts, about 2 Abhorrents and to top it off, a Ashenbone Drake.<br />
<br />
Next time we pulled a scorn banshee...30 secs after that we got swarmed with 15+ mobs.<br />
<br />
Needless to say we had many many deaths that night, and we finally gave up after the banshee train.<br />
<br />
We did kick Nagafen's ass the coming day though as payback  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
(For the first time in the servers history too i might add  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/biggrin.gif )<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had problems in Hate since the last patch?  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

 Fear is a little less buggy, but Fear is amazingly hard to break spawn at. In return Fear is worth the work to break, because it is rarely a bug that causes deaths, it is mostly too many mobs and stupidity of players.<br />
 No, I am not calling -you- stupid, but among the 12-18 players needed to break such a hard spawn, you will always find one person who can screw it up...either he want to or not. <br />

They got 2 or 3 trains in a row (I think) then petitioned because once or twice after getting wiped out the mobs were getting stuck in the room and camping the corpses.  So I don't know if the GM's killed those mobs or what, but eventually they got things going again and were in there for quite some time.  Then Sunday afternoon I went in with a new group.  Five hours later, 3 trains, lots of deaths and no dead mobs, I left.  Again, people stayed, I think they petitioned the GM's again, and somehow were then able to kill things again.  Man, we had some uber trains...I was 5 spite golems, 2 banshees, 2 abbhorants, 2 ire ghasts, 2 clerics and 1 revenant.  It was almost comical.<br />

It looked the same, on first pull we got like 6 or more mobs comming including that ashenbone drake (which are from second floor far away from entrance)... We've been doing PoH alot before this, so after killing both Voxx, Nagafen and cleared all PoF, all in one weekend, we though PoH would be a nice way to round it up. Well let's hope it's fixed in the patch today...<br />

There are MOBs above you at the zone, and they can run around on the second floor triggering MOBs on the bottom from and, if it's an agro cleric or two up top, they can ruin your whole day.<br />
<br />
GMs will usually reset those MOBs and kill any that get stuck in the zone room.<br />

Yes, Hate is a buggy place with bad pathing, but I'll go 8 of 10 times I'm asked  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
