<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunik</div><div class="date">02-04-2000, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I am getting discouraged about playing everquest.  I have made level 40 but all the excitement appears to be gone until I reach my mid to high 40's when I can do dragon and planes raids.  Here is what I mean.<br />
<br />
First: It seems that my only choices for hunting are Sol B, Lower Guk, Orge Guard Hunting, Kithcor Woods, or SG/Specter hunting.   <br />
<br />
a.  Lower Guk.  There are so many people camping the place that I can move about in almost total safety.  When I get into a group I have the joy of waiting 30 minutes for spawns we kill the 3-5 spawns then wait some more.  ASS/Supplier (nice loot, not many spawns) (I wont go into the others)<br />
<br />
b.  Sol B.  I got into the King camp and stayed for 4 hours.  No challenge at all.  Stand cast a few heals, sit med, melee/stun a bit.  No one in any danger at all.  The bats/spiders are okay with a proper group.<br />
<br />
b.  Kithcor woods.  Great hunting at night followed by 1 hour of surfing the web on my other computer until Everquest Night comes again.<br />
<br />
c.  Orge Guard Hunting.  Very simular to Sol B.  Nice exp, no excitement no danger at all.<br />
<br />
d.  SG Hunting.  Not bad when you can get a group going.<br />
<br />
I am probably just burning out on Everquest, but I have started playing Demise and that feels a whole lot better.  Granted it does not have the world of Norrath but at least it's exciting.  Is there a future?   Or just more camping?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">02-04-2000, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, servers sure are crowded.  ***IF*** you just want to level through 40 - 45 e-mail me and I'll let you know about a few spots that are just GREAT XP at this level.  Of course, powerleveling is damned boring too, but it is a quick way to get through this stage to the more exciting moments.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I can only suggest trying places off the well-beaten track.  We got a lot of experience in LGuk, but didn't do it on the dead side at all (just too crowded).  Instead we worked:<br />
<br />
-&amp;gt;Elder Room (Minos, drops the nice Chrysoberyl Talisman)<br />
-&amp;gt;Patriarch Room (Azure sleeves, Ebony Blade)<br />
-&amp;gt;Crusader/Priest, GREAT XP here, need a good high-30s, low 40s group (prob better w/ low 40s).  Drops Silver Plated Legs (in high demand oddly enough, they arent that special), the Runed Falchion, and the Runed Mithril Tunic (you know, that druid tunic).<br />
-&amp;gt;Noble/Shaman area - further down there are some shamans and the noble (I think).  Nothing special, but stuff to kill.<br />
-&amp;gt;Elemental/Herbalist/King area -- The big boys of the live side, but again, can be fun.<br />
-&amp;gt;We wandered one night all through the live side just killing whatever we saw.  Was fun  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif.<br />
<br />
Never did worth a crap in SolB.<br />
<br />
Spending a lot of time in OOT and Kedge now, but those places require pre-set groups for the most part.<br />
<br />
Regardless, good luck,<br />

The Priest/Crusader spawn aka the keep, is one of the best places for exp.  There are just a ton of mobs there.  The other night, our group was a lvl49 SK, lvl47 Ranger, lvl41 Ranger, and me lvl39 Cleric.  The 4 of us worked the keep long enough for all of us to level.  Even the loot was great 5 sets of silver greaves, 2 mithril tunics, and a runed falchion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on where to head now, would be greatly appricated.<br />

Take a tank with the silver-plated greaves, and a Mithril BP that is a total of +3 Str, +20 Agl, +10 Hps.  Add in the AC of the greaves and the bp, you have a well protected tank.<br />
