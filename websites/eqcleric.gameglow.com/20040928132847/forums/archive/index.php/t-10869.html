<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">07-01-2001, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For first time, recommend the following...<br />
<br />
Clear king room, and DA pull Queen room right to the King spawn spot. Then, pick off all the room spawns as they roam back (Queen goes back last). Wait for Queen to go back, and move into hallway to quickly buff up, med, etc. Then everyone move down near door, and have someone with DA run in right upto the Queen. When she AE's (makes an animation the DA person can see), have all the tanks rush in and use damage disciplines right away. Clerics follow the tanks closely, out of AE range if possible though. Nukers don't nuke at all till 50% imo.. pong will most definetly kill you on your first try.<br />
<br />
Now you can do 2 things.<br />
<br />
Either you can have 1 cleric per big tank, chain CH'ing that 1 tank so he never dies, but you'll have mass deaths from people not getting healed if you don't kill her before she AE's again. Or you can chain group heal till you're oom, so no one dies. First choice is safer, 2nd is cleaner. Upto you.<br />
<br />
She dies in about 7 seconds now these days... and AE's every 10 seconds, so try to kill her in under 20.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kampf</div><div class="date">07-02-2001, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried here today .. we some success.  We used the 'one tank' killing method.  We sort of had a mis-pull and half the forces died before the fight, but it didn't matter much.  A shaman said he landed slow, and we had 1x 58 warrior and 1x 60 mage fire pet attacking the queen.  Had about 4 clerics CHealing the warrior, and we were for the most part fine.  When the queen got to 5%, she bolted into the library, then proceeded to gate though... That's something we'll have to work on for next time  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

You'll want your nukers alive to kill the last few percent, cause she runs... fast  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
She has like no resists, everyone can nuke.</div></div><hr />

About to have to go back. It will be interesting to see how far she gets with the running bit when 4 wizards open up with sunstrike.  &lt;g&gt;<br />

You said for someone to DA pull the entire queen room to the king pit and pick off guards as they wander back.<br />
<br />
Where is everyone else?  In the hallway before the King/Queen area?  Or do they run into the Queen room after the pull?</div></div><hr />

Need to kill king, and clear king room , then pull all guards out of queen room except maybe 1 or 2 , then have chanters run down and target the extra mobs, send in a Pally with DA and agro the queen and drag here to the back wall of her platform. Then send in all the tanks , and have the clerics follow, and casters after clerics , we had 8-9 groups which was serious overkill, but oh well. With 7 wizards the queen lasted all of 20 seconds</div></div><hr />
