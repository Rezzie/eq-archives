IMHO we're totally having way too many no drop items (I'm not referring to the quest items, I mean the loots from rare spawns in dungeons) in this game. I understand the reason behind this... They want us to go down to the dungeons and actually hunt down the mobs and work for those items. That's cool with me but is that what's really going on in the dungeons? Here's a typical scenerio in sol B:<br />
<br />
In the champ's room... champ spawns, the champ's group kill the champ... leader loots and says, &quot;PB&quot;. Everybody sighs and ask the warrior in the gruop, &quot;Have you got the PB yet?&quot;.  &quot;Yea I've got it already&quot;, the warrior replies. &quot;FREE PB loot outside champ's room&quot;, they yell.  I'm sick of this!!! How many free this free that do we need in this game? This is not the worst of the story... the pathetic one I've seen was a level 14 warrior walking into sol B champ's room at peak hours, sitting there to wait for the Painbringer loot. When the champ goes down and the PB drops... hey nobody wants the loot and logically that warrior loots it... It's quite not right to charge the guy to loot for something you can't use anyway... <br />
<br />
Can somebody actually tell those guys in verant that their no_drop plan is NOT WORKING??? I've send /feedback every time I see this and I've never had any replies from GMs or anything... I don't see that they're planning on a change either. *sigh*  <br />
<br />
Conclusion: I believe putting no drop items in the loots of popular xp camping places like sol B is pathetic! If you wanna make things no drop, put them deep in the dungeons like Ghoulbane which they should have made them no_drop the first day of the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">01-12-2000, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, I don't really like no drop either.  Instead, I would rather see more more things tagged Lore Item.  This, to me, provides much better control over who gets what loot (with the restritction you can only have 1).  Now I know this doesnt solve the annoying problem of high level people being bastards, but it will cut down on how much they can be there.<br />
To complement this strategy, Verant would need to reduce spawn times.  If you can only have 1 item, you have to leave the group once you get it.  This also puts some onus on the players to do crowd control.  From my experiences, I will use the dwarven work boot spawn.  If it was a lore item, once someone gets them, BYE.  They are dropped from the group and given a invis to get out.  This is not to be rude, rather to ensure that as many people as possible get a shot at the boots.<br />
<br />
However, this plan could be too simple so it will probably never get looked into.  Also, I am sure there are at least a dozen exploiters out there who have already thought of 10 ways to get around it.  *sigh* Oh well.<br />

Fare thee well.<br />

B&amp;gt; Farming... LORE is the official solution to farming. Don't take my words? Check out the non lore items like DWB, NS Wreath.<br />
<br />
C&amp;gt; Like I said, NO DROP only takes those items out of the market... it doesn't necessarily contribute to helping ebay farming at all.<br />
<br />
D&amp;gt; They piss me off too! You're not alone... and I really really wish you could show me how a level 50 druid can take the king room alone even if PB, FR are not NO DROP. You obviously haven't read my post in length and haven't even tried to understand the real situation there.<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keryath</div><div class="date">01-13-2000, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look, I don't much care for your rude reply, so I guess I'll respond in the same tone.<br />
<br />
Since you're obviously a coward and a slacker, you've never had to break into the king room or hit sol b when it's not camped by 60+ ppl. when it was set up, no way a lvl 14 was going to waltz down into the king room. So even now that it's camped to hell, technically it's *still* in the heart of a dungeon. Jerk.<br />
<br />
Alos, LORE is a half ass solution to farming at best. Typically you get Mr lore item, /auction selling this crap thing, *sold* Farm some more. Also, the twinking is getting kinda excessive.<br />
<br />
As far as ebay farming, hey, it's not on the market, it can't be farmed. Make it all no drop. <br />
<br />
AND, not just the PB is NO DROP, so don't blather about how there's no way a druid can solo that room. You were talking about a generalized subject, so expect a generalized answer. The obsidian scimitar is farmed, the obsidian flamberge is not. Why? One's no drop.<br />
<br />
and yes, I have a point. I don't mind no drop, I even like no drop, so YOUR opinion, that NO DROP sucks, is not the ONLY opinion, so deal with it.<br />
<br />
Besides, what's your point? Do you propose to do away with no drop? Oh, that'd be Greeeeat. I can wait to see the lvl 5 with a sunderfury and full fear gear. <br />
<br />
so basicly, No drop *is* a solution, maybe not the best solution, but it's working. Sure, it might annoy you with the PB, but if you can think of a better solution, feel free to post it. Until then, when someone posts a rebuttal, you can try to at least be civil about it. Whining and crying about the lvl 14 asking if he can loot PB doesn't make you anything more than a big baby. If you don't want them to loot it, destroy it, that's you choice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arazmas</div><div class="date">01-16-2000, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nada, I've led a group of guys of 35~42 to break into sol b when there were nobody camping the rares and a total of like 15 in the zone. *grin* <br />
<br />
I ain't rude. I'm just very very frustrated on how the nodrop system is implemented into the game, and very disappointed on how ignorant the verant dev team is.<br />
<br />
I guess I should respect your opinion that nodrop is a way of stopping farming. However it's obviously having more negative effects than possitive ones. (unwanted items lying around, free items given to people around the zone, low levels there getting them, ruining the player economy, and so on). As for the destroy part, yes I have destroyed many many no drop items, and if I WERE the leader of that group, I would have only told that group that I don't think the low level deserves it and destroyed it. Yes I've done that before. However, if you're not the leader (which is hmm logically 5 out of 6 times when you group?), you don't make the call, correct? Making the looter pay for the looting right only makes you a jerk. (right don't argue with me on this... i don't remember how many times people flame of those selling looting rights on avo charms and such)<br />
<br />
IMHO, making everything no drop is like... chopping away your arms on a phsyco so that he cannot harm others anymore. There are things that should be no drop, but not used extensivly.  Lore is an easier solution which doesn't hurt the player economy too mcuh. <br />
<br />
By the way... the DWB scenerio: I've camped unrest spirit for over 7 levels on this character... 45 as of today and it's not my first already. I've seen countless people leaving right after their loot (ring or boots), or people leaving right after their boots loot... making them lore... doens't really make much of a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Random drop + no drop for all rare items would be my vote.  Random + lore for common drop is also my choice.<br />
<br />
Why no-drop?  I'm sorry, a 50 necro taking up supplier, kicking out 6 ppl to twink his new rogue is not right.<br />
<br />
Besides, who cares is free stuff gets offered from the drops.  You don't see a problem with the shin greaves or gauntlets, do you? Or the basalt carapice? or the cardnal pauldrons?<br />
<br />
Seems like they are quite decent items and no one ever fights or super-camps those.  Everyone is happy.  The only ones who b*tch about this whole deal is the ultra power gamers and e-farmers.<br />

My bro and I have a few chars on the PvP...all decked in no drop equip...sneak into LG, got all the Shin equip...Head to Sol B, got a painbringer...and the carnal. No drops are a band-aid for the real problems. A quick fix that doesnt really help - ruins a real economy. Problem is that why would someone want to twink insted of trade for good items thier main can use? Because most of the best equip is no drop...  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ergo</div><div class="date">01-27-2000, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arss Rubybone summed it up nicely, I think.  The only real solution is random spawns, and, I think, random loot.  Just because you find the orc trainer, doesn't mean you're gonna get a shiny brass shield.  Maybe you'll loot a mesh mantle off him.  Or whatever.  And the solution even goes further than that - unique items.  Only 1 ghoulbane sword in the whole game.  Then it wouldn't matter what you killed.  Everyone would just have fun killing whatever.<br />
<br />
All problems solved. It'd take EQ II to pull this off, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doram</div><div class="date">01-27-2000, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not, instead of making items NO-DROP make them non tradeable to characters ~8 levels below the person with the item.  That way, a level 50 necro cant twink their new rogue, they can only give their item to a level 42 character and up.<br />
<br />
I think a system similar to this is the ONLY way to go to solve this problem.</div></div><hr />

Why not, you need x level to equip the weapon?

Personally, I don't give a rat's a** about regular drops.  I support nodrop for one simple reason:  our quest armor.  If it was nodrop, you wouldn't see anyone (druid or otherwise) farming it.  Why?  Because they'd end up with a piece of armor they couldn't wear and couldn't sell.<br />

<br />
If you aren't at least within 3 levels of the MoB (just a rough figure), you can't equip/use the item....let alone get it to proc (if there is one).<br />
<br />
1.  Stops Twinking<br />
    Why bother getting that nice EXE Axe for your new warrior?  You would have to be high enough level to get the axe as a warrior in order to use/equip it anyways.  It takes up room in your bank/inventory else.<br />
2.  Stops Farming<br />
    Can't use the item yourself, and anyone else that you would sell it to has equal odds of already having it (because they are of a level that actually HAS a chance to get it)<br />
3.  Stops Ebay<br />
    So you wanna sell that nice MithRil BP on Ebay.  Well...lets see...it can only be used by lvl 35+ players.  Hmm...Seems that ALOT of lvl 35+ players already have this item in the game.  Or have something equivalent/better that they have traded for or gotten in game.  And the odds of someone paying RL cash for an item that they can get on their own with a little bit of effort, is extremely LOW.<br />

The only way to stop it is to have the PLAYERS stop it.  If people refused to buy the stuff, people would stop farming it.  Of course, people won't stop, but...<br />
<br />
IMO, the LORE/NODROP setup we have now is fine.<br />
<br />
I find nothing wrong with &quot;twinking&quot;.  I played a Warrior for some time before I moved from Quellious; does that mean that if I started a Warrior on Test that I should have to drudge through the first 15 or 20 identical levels?  No.  I'm gonna give him 25 or 50 plat and some bronze armor at level 5 or so.  This isn't hindering my playing abilities one bit, as I've already been through the stupid newbie levels already.<br />

Farming/EBay... See first paragraph.<br />

At level 6, 9, whatever you go camp a shiny brass shield from Crushbone.  You get it eventually.  You may NEVER loot a shiny brass shield again.

People take things so literally<br />
<br />
What I SHOULD have said as well..<br />
<br />
Point #4)<br />
<br />
Level Limits on items would not STOP people from simply handing money over to their other chars OR buying PP on Ebay...it would take ALOT to do that...but it would encourage more transactions in the economy.  A wizard CAN loot an EXE axe.  But it can only be sold or traded to someone near enough in level that they could get it on their own.<br />
<br />
Although I am against twinking....I'm not faulting someone for twinking their own chars.  That's their call.  What I am against is a lvl 50 camping an item to hand off to their or someone else's twinks.  Now..if you wanted to say..hand 10k plat to your lvl 5 warrior and go out and buy great stuff...then fine...thats your call too.  But you wouldn't be buying the high end items...just the high end items appropriate to your current or soon to be level.<br />
<br />
It encourages more in the player economy.  Full bronze for a lvl 5 would be AMAZING...I know I'd cry if I had that at level 5.  Also, a nice level 5 warrior in Full bronze, a combine sword, and 10k in the bank will, as soon as they are able to use it, buy the BEST stuff for their NEXT level...and so on...Every time they reach a point where they can UTILIZE another, better weapon/armor piece...they will go out and buy, trade or camp it themselves.<br />
<br />
That gets money moving...<br />
<br />
And if you've seen the Plane of Air....you know that Verant wants to suck money outta the population.<br />
<br />
Also, if you think 10K is unlikely....forget it...I have 17k in the bank now, and the items that I need, you can't buy...as they are all no drop.  So all the money I am currently making...isn't doing anything but accumulating.<br />

If you look at it in terms of time is money, it makes SENSE to buy items from eBay because it is more economical... Here's a perfect example.<br />
<br />
I was camping for the Paw of Opolla.  Stayed up all night camping it, as I had taken the next day off work so I could sit on Mitty forever until I got the gold ring.  After 10.5 hours straight on Mitty, 2 high levels come in and force me out of the camp.  Now I'm ticked off, tired, and wasted a vacation day from work.  The economics of it:  in 8 hours of work I can make over $250.  The paws have sold for around $200 on eBay.  Makes sense to me to buy it from eBay to save the boring hassle and frustration of a camp.<br />
<br />
2nd example.  Camping for the Mammoth Cloak at level 40.  None of the gobs in Perma give XP.  I camp for 7.5 hours with ZERO spawns of the alchemist.  All placeholders.  That was 7.5 hours completely wasted.  I watched 3 lame movies on TV, and did laundry (yay).  Mammoth cloaks sell for about $60 on eBay, so it's much more economical to buy the item then to camp for it.<br />
<br />
Not that I bought either of those items from eBay (I didn't, traded for them in game), but you can see from my 2 examples why I have pretty much given up camping for items that don't give me XP.  If I *really* want the item, I'll buy it from eBay.<br />

<br />
I love no drop, but if everything were no drop then the economics of eq would be dead.  I feel that the classes/races who can use the item can &quot;use&quot; the item, ie loot it off the mob or trade/accept a trade. <br />

Also, lvl limits on weapons is a great idea, so you dont have a newbie wielding some weapon of the gods.  Sure he could get it, but couldnt equip it.  Would recieve a msg such as &quot;your weapon skill is not sufficient to weild this weapon&quot;.  <br />
<br />
None of this will change but it would sure be nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's all the things that happen as a RESULT of things being sold on Ebay.<br />
<br />
Platinum for sale isn't a biggie.  Neither is an entire character.  Although you don't really want to group with these folks.  Cuase they won't know how to play their char.<br />
<br />
Its the people that farm items for sale on Ebay.  They deny these items to those in the game that are striving to get them.  Its RL intruding on the game as was stated before.<br />
<br />
Scenario #1..Lvl 50whatever camps an item they can not use, and control the spawn easily.  They get exp from the kills, but can't get anymore exp than they already have.  They are camping to sell the item on Ebay.<br />
<br />
Scenario #2..A nice lvl 35-45 party of characters fight their way down to the same spawn spot.  They have 3 members of the group that could REALLY use the item thats going to drop from the critters.<br />
<br />
Who is more deserving of the item in question?  The person that has no ingame use for it, but has a want for RL cash.  Or the people that have a legitimate use for the item in game?<br />
<br />
I'll go with the latter every time<br />

<br />
I'd like to see you cry your heart out when you start seeing lvl 14 chars in Ethereal Mist or Indicolite. PB is just total crap, lvl 14 warrior having it is insignificant compared to him having planar gear (you might not have any idea how much planar gear actually rots). Every lvl 50 newbie would soon have at least the most common drops (gauntlets, boots) of their class. No way I'd want to see this happen. Let the lvl 14 enjoy his PB.<br />

2.  You dont play on a PvP server and see these damn newbie PKs (lvl 6 or so) running around with lvl 30 type equipment killing all the people who just started to play the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've already seen a lvl 20 rogue with naggys little dagger, twinking already going too far imo.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talura cwn'Zeylon</div><div class="date">03-02-2000, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, two ideas here (both of which will probably get called stupid and get me flamed but such is life),<br />
1. Why not make it so that when a mob takes down a PC it loots one random item (that is not nodrop) and goes on its merry way? This would strongly discourage hardcore twinking at low levels, and discourage it up until at least the mid teens. (Maybe have it grab coin too, just to be mean.)<br />
2. On the high-level dungeons like SolB, put a new mod in for all creatures...aggro on anyone under X level that wanders by (basically, toss that 1st level warrior's name to the top of the hatelist and turn him into a little red splotch on the floor before he even notices he's getting attacked). <br />
<br />
Neither idea is nice, neither will 100% eliminate twinking, but it'd give me a private smile watching it happen to someone else http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif...(am I sick because of this?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">03-06-2000, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No drop is the least of our problems.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Isn't it weird how our caduceus (one of the easier pieces to get) is no-drop, while the breastplace and bracers aren't? <br />
<br />
I'm thrilled that they made the pieces for our armor un-farmable by making them no drop.  It was bad enough when Bilge was being camped out the ying by druids (sorry, guys, but it's true) for the reed belt or whatnot, and they just left the damn ingots there to rot.  At least Dwigus is tough and doesn't drop anything but those wonderful bows and the ingot now.<br />
<br />
My idea on twink-stopping?  Make items level-specific.  The proc they have now (you do not have sufficient will to command blah blah) is great - makes me nauseous when I see a 5th level spellchucker with a robe of the oracle and a staff of writhing - at least it doesn't proc for them for 20 or so more levels.<br />
<br />
Make an item (take the Exe axe for example) unusable by anyone below.. say.. 30th?  It should be dependent on the level of the mob that drops it.  So you got yourself a lovely painbringer?  Great!  Ohhhh... dang!  You can't use it cause you're only 12th level?  That is SUCH a shame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostbite</div><div class="date">03-17-2000, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my suggestion to slow down farming is make lore items really lore. Lore just means a farmer has to die or lose a dual not loot the item and lore is useless now they can go back and continue farming. When an item is lore it should still be lore when its on ur body.<br />
