<br />
ok, nerfed for sanity reasons  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
<br />
It's gone, it's truly gone. And nobody but active EQ players can post there now. If you really want an issue heard now is the time.<br />

 That is until someone hacks that DB, and I know for a fact that that board will be under direct outside attack to make it tough to get into for a while.<br />
 I visited a chatroom in disguise and totally firewalled this morning, man some of these teenagers sure can be vindictive. <br />
 I wouldn't even call some or most of the folks in that chat room hackers, but they do have tools and the time. With that alone they can make life hell for some folks and that will be their intention for a bit.<br />
 How long before they socially engineer a few  logins and bam folks loose accounts?<br />
 Should be minimal, but I am sure it will occur.<br />

<br />
It is posted on both the Bugs Forum (http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum3/HTML/000032.html) and the General Discussion Forum (http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/000184.html) so that the players will see it as well as (hopefully) Verant.<br />

<br />
I had this bug happen when I tried 4 times to rez a guy in the Overthere zone.  He finally petitioned, and a GM showed up.  I remember the GM saying something like, where is his corpse(even though it showed it being right in front of him).<br />
<br />
Then he did rez him, and the guy got a full exp rez out of it.<br />
<br />
But then again maybe some GM's do give exp rez's, and some GM's don't.<br />
<br />
PS: I for one do NOT like the censoring on their message board.  If anyone has seen the Seinfeld eposode about the &quot;Soup Nazi&quot;, well that is excactly how they are now acting.<br />
<br />
Does anyone honestly believe that Verant will pay more attentions to requests now?  I know for a fact they won't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Segal</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt really see any requests on Whineplay.  I saw death threats, obcenity, vulgarity, and generally immature people spamming the boards with literally 1000's of poorly formed opinions (and in most cases simply incorrect information).  I have not read that forum for months simply for that fact.<br />
<br />
I do like your example of the 'soup nazi' though, its a very good one.  They run a company and have a right to transact business in the way that they sees as most profitable. If they drive away certain customers during that process then they suffer the concequences.  As a businessman, I certainly would not have offered a forum for people to basically harass me and condemn my product. That is not a normal business practice and the customers certainly have ZERO right to expect it.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the fact that Verant does want input from the player community, otherwise they would simply do away with the boards. I also think they correctly surmised that the immature rants of several 100 people on Whineplay in no way represents the vast majority of the players.  As is in past, I think a well thought out, well presented, mature post will catch the attention of Verant.  All the change does, and I think Verant stated this pretty well, is remove the background noise that they did not pay attention to anyway.<br />
