</FONT><HR>Here are my reasons:<P>1) The customer's opinion of Verant is horrible<BR>I think the damage they have done with their user base will cost them in the long run.  I wonder if Lucas is putting pressure on them about this and wants to pull out of the Star Wars game.  I bet Lucus will try and distance themselves from the Verant's name if this game is released.  This area has been such a nightmare for Sony and Verant I bet you this and number 2 were the demise of Brad.<BR>2) The release of SoL *after* DAoC<BR>This is a major blunder.  Sony needed to release this before DAoC and they were caught off guard.  They are making a vain attempt to try and hide the numbers by now showing us how many people are playing now, but you can tell the servers are dead.  In order to try and get people to buy this game, they will need to put in mega loot that will unbalance the game.  I think it will be a day late and a dollar short.  This one cost Verant big bucks and it alone could of been the reason for his departure.<BR>3) The failure of the new servers<BR>More capital expense for Verant, more pissed off customers.  They promised that they were going to try and help balance the Sullon Zek server and they've done nothing.  People are leaving in droves and the role playing server is a joke.  Just another waist of money without any return.<BR>4) Failure to listen to customers concerns about class balancing<BR>Classes have been griping for years now and they claim now they just realized that melees need adjusting.  How many customers were lost because of the unbalanced classes and more importantly, they ignoring or insulting you when you bring it up.  Just another example of how they have mismanaged this game and have alienated themselves from the user base.<BR>5) Ester the Tester post<BR>What was that?  Was I the only one that was pissed off at this post.  Coming from a software development background how hard could it be for them to test quests before they go live?  How many times have we *already* sent in feedback about fixing these things.  This is just a PR move to try and act like they are doing something.  I would fire Ester because their QA sucks at that company.  Things like quests are the easiest thing in the world to test and they can't even do that.<BR>5) Brad hasn't leveled Aradune in 6 months<P>Your thoughts?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

When I first saw this post I just couldn't believe my eyes. They are even asking loc of the NPC who starts the quest. That means they don't have a database for all the quests they have (how hard would it be to find out exact location of the NPC from name?). So are new item's stats and nerf after that. They don't seem to have a person(s) who check all new items/quests before they go live.<P>Their QA department has to do something... it's long overdue.<P>------------------<BR>Rolant Starfield<BR>High Priest of Rodcet Nife<BR>Courageous Few<BR>Tunare Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

From my point of view, something like 10% of the EQ population (on Erollisi Marr, at least) is trying DAoC out, but that doesn't mean it's dead. Heck, the majority of them haven't canceled their EQ accounts, which means that Verant gets money for the accounts without having to get more resources for them to play.<P>The Ester the Tester post boggled me quite a bit, too, but I can't say I got pissed at it.

</FONT><HR>Hi guys, long time no see. I haven't played EQ but maybe twice since DAOC came out, but I am still around and still keeping up with events. Let me comment on some things.<P>#1 Whoever made the original post is basically correct in one unstated assumption. It CANNOT be a coincidence that Brad McQuaid left EQ, "to pursue other projects," at the same time that DAOC was released. Was he fired, as has been suggested? I don't think so, but I'll bet the split wasn't exactly amicable.<P>#2 DAOC is the best selling game in America right now. They topped 100000 subscribers and added six new servers in the first week alone. And having played both EQ and DAOC, let me say that while the mass player exodus may not have happened, DAOC is nonetheless going to wind up having big effects on EQ. In fact, it already has.<P>#3 The original poster is correct in that a lot of EQ's player base is disgruntled. However, EQ's player base is also not going to run off immediately to another game. The fiascos of AC and AO have left a bitter taste in the mouths of those searching for alternatives to EQ. Well, DAOC has finally provided a viable alternative, but it will take time for people to overcome their cynicism about other games.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>Vicar of Mayhem, Rathe<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=15436" TARGET=_blank>View my profile</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem" TARGET=_blank>Meet my guild</A><p>[This message has been edited by Galavant (edited 10-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

I love EQ, never thought I would leave.  But I am enjoying DAoC greatly.<P>As to the quests, well I can imagine how huge that database would be to track all of that information.  Giving them specific helpful information isnt a big deal, if it makes the game better.  And its so true that servers name things differently than other server or even designers do.

</FONT><HR>Cephas, if you're referring to the guild I think you're referring to, they were having major problems even BEFORE the release of DAoC. I'm still convinced that people who were getting fed up with EQ were really eager to try something different, and DAoC offered that. Then again, I left Torv long ago.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR><B>Breea</B><BR><I>TEST Server</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I haven't logged onto EQ since DAoC was released.  I played EQ for over 2 years but became very disenfranchised with Verant's attitude toward their player base.  This attitude is reflected in class balance issues, poor customer service, unresolved bugs, and plenty of unaddressed player concerns such as downtime.  Of the biggest complaints I had about EQ, DAoC seems to have fixed them.  They are more open about changes and how things work than Verant.  For me, this is a good thing.  I won't be coming back to EQ until I see major changes from Verant.  Stop releasing the next great expansion and focus on what's broken in the current game.    </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Perhaps it is a bit different on my server or perhaps it is my impressions, but DAoC seems to have had a fairly moderate sized impact on Fennin Ro.<P>These are my perceptions as related to the active player base on FR:<P>Old Sebilis 4 months ago - 100+ people all the time.<P>Old Sebilis 1.5 months ago - 50+ people approx during peak times. Velks Lab 1.5 months ago - 30+ people approx during peak times<P>Old Sebilis today - 20 people or less during peak times. Velks Lab today - 20 people approx during peak times. Chardok today - 12 people approx during peak times.<P>Significant player base guild movement as the higher level guilds are actively recruiting and in most cases lowering their entrance requirements.<P>Raids that previously contained guild only people + recruiting invites now are often actively inviting *needed* classes just to fill out raids. Raiding guilds that usually raid 5+ days a week appear to only be raiding 2-3+ days a week.<P>The /who all [ insert guildname/number ] that previously would return the "List cut short because it's too long" message now often shows 20ish people where normal later evening activity would be 40+ (later evening = 11pm EST on for my purposes)<P>Guild dissolutions & Guild alliances/mergers... I have seen atleast 4 guilds that as little as a month ago had 80+ members disband. Smaller guilds are actively merging or seeking guild alliances to have raid capability where they previously could handle things like PoF or PoH internally with little or no difficulty.<P>Just a personal estimate... but since they took the server player numbers off the log in screen I would estimate that Fennin Ro has gone from an average of 2400-2500 during peak hours down to 1800-1900 people if they are lucky. Thats a 25-35% decline in the player base and is fairly significant. All indicators point to the recent release of DAoC although I have no empirical evidence to support that conclusion as fact.. it's unconfirmed theory. But a 30% average loss of your player base, and therefore your revenue is a significant impact.<P>Just my personal wild conclusions and unsubstantiated theories (ie. my 2cp)<P><P>------------------<BR>Panteroo Mcgillakudy<BR>Patriarch of the Patron Saints<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well I can't tell you how many people are playing EQ on the servers, but I can tell you that DAoC seems to be approaching almost 40k every night.  That number seems to be reminiscent of the early days of EQ.  I know my server seems crowded and it's not uncommon for people to be fighting over spawns from time to time which is also extremely reminiscent of early EQ =).<P>AO's problems were all self-inflicted and Dalur was correct in that there was a horrible patch, but that patch was by no means their main problem; I had left before the patch, the patch just confirmed my decision.  There were numerous other problems including a severe problem with higher level content and play balance, but the bottom line is the company is just flat out amatuerish.  I hope they (Funcom) survive long enough to mature as a company, but that issue seems doubtful.<P>DAoC is far from perfect, but the folks at Mythic used their time wisely.  They learned from other companies and it shows throughout the product.  I'm not interested in giving them credit for being more "player friendly" in their communications as Verant used to be more player friendly also.  DAoC's game design, however, is indeed more player friendly as it's obviously been designed to remove much of the intentional tedium of which Everquest has so much.  Downtime, soloing, and grouping with more casual playing friends is just nice in DAoC.  In EQ my friends who didn't have the time to keep up just got left behind.<P>DAoC is certainly not nirvana, but it's a good game for those who are bored with EQ, yet still want to have online adventures.  For those of you who haven't "finished" EQ (such as maxing your level, visiting all the places you really want to see, etc), I certainly understand sticking around.  For those of you who have finished DAoC is a pretty nice alternative.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just from hopping around the DAOC servers while experimenting with characters, here's some BIG guild names I have seen...<P>1. DROW. AKA Blood of the Spider, THE level 60 uberguild of the Rathe.<P>2. Harbingers of Fate. Another EQ guild making the crossover.<P>3. Fires of Heaven. Yes, the same folks as on Veeshan, the ones who DEFINED what being an "uberguild" meant.<P>These are just three big ones that I immediately recognized...two of which are major uberguilds. I know that a lot of other EQ guilds are probably crossing over as well.
