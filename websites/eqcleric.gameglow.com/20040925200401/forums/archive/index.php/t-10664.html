I had an excellent time, and Superior heal will do nicely there, especially if you have at least 1 or 2 good tanks.<br />
<br />
Also, if you are lucky with the dice, there is a big chance at winning something nice. (or 10 nice things like I did last night)<br />

I headed to Frontier be accident on my way to Lake of Ill Omen when I gor persuaded into grouping at the giant fort.  8 days later I got almost 5 levels, zero deaths, 800pp, and a Forest Loop.<br />
<br />
The spawns are so fast that you only get a few seconds between pulls, if you are in a good group that is.  I don't think I have ever gone oom hunting at the giant fort and always been constantly hunting   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Good Hunting!<br />

<br />
Currently I have been there for 2 weeks, seen countless loops drop (won 3) and am now 32. <br />
<br />
You can stay there until late 30's, most people don't because it gets a little boring and more fun is to be had in kaerora or overthere or burning woods, but there are craigs and above to keep you happy should you feel the need.<br />
<br />
Non loop loot is pretty nice too, you can easily make 200-300pp in a 3 hour stint if you have a good group that pulls non stop.<br />

If you really want fast exp try getting a group in Overthere.<br />
Going to go try the specs now! haver never even seen a spec!<br />

The other drops I have seen are Giant Forman's Tunic, Weighted Axe, Giant Tree Flayer, Axe of the Iron Back, Straw Spun Belt, etc.  I hunted there from level 28 - 31/32.  I haven't hunted there since I got my second FLoop, but it is a good place to go if you want to join a group for exp and pp.<br />

<br />
There's a smaller giant fort over in Warsliks Woods which is almost NEVER hunted (on Veeshan server, at least). The giants tend to run a bit lower level (some were green at 33 to 35, but most were light blue to dark blue). Hunted first here in late 20s. Came back in a trio  of mid-thirties and we had a ridiculously easy time of keeping the fort cleared for three hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At around 34-35 head to Crystal Caverns. Much better exp and loot. More excitement than OT.<br />

At this level I would recomend Overthere, not Frontier Mountains.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qono</div><div class="date">10-08-2002, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where to go at 34...most say OT, but I hate kunark so I don't even think of going there.<br />
At 34 you can go to GD(Great Divide) or try DP(Dawnshroud Peaks).  Or even try grouping in Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nadams124</div><div class="date">10-09-2002, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great Divide.? ill try that now my cleric is 34lvl and i dont like kunark either..
