<br />
1) What mob has it and what is their lvl? Is it a rare spawn? Heavily camped? Do I have any chance of camping the mob by myself and getting the shield? Or should I just...<br />
<br />
2) Buy it? What is a reasonable price to pay? Or should I...<br />
<br />
3) Trade for it?  I currently have a Cracked Darkwood Shield AC12, +9str, light. (just in case any warriors are reading this) I would gladly trade my Darkwood for a Gaurdian but that's all I have that I'm willing to trade.<br />

<br />
From what i've heard, it is around lvl 28-30 in level, but the big problem is that the sucker is 100% magic resistant.<br />
<br />
So no root n shoot on that one - you'll need a couple of melee friends to help you take it out. Cause if she gets away, yer in for a world of pain.<br />
<br />
If she carries the shield, you will see it on her. The rare drop is the Charred Guardian Breastplate (dun know the stats).<br />
<br />
I've heard that the respawn time is upwards of 6 hours (cant confirm this myself).<br />
<br />
I paid 800pp for mine, but our server is decently young (Quellious), and i've heard that they go for 500-600 on other servers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanlee</div><div class="date">10-22-1999, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) it's dropped by the gnome exg in solusek A. It is a rare spawn, there are 2 different clockwork placeholders that can spawn in its place. It is often camped. It's Level 30 or so, but you'll need a good group at that level to have a chance, it's a tough mob and will resist ALL spells, and there are other gnomes that will join in the fight. Atone is a very usefull spell here.<br />
<br />
2) and 3) Prices can range from 800pp to 1500, or even more in trade. I've seen them traded for a manastone or runed mithril bracer.<br />
