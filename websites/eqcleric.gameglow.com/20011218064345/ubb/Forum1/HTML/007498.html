</FONT><HR>Well...for a while at least.  <P>Sorry I've been posting a few topics on the board lately.  Don't mean to be a pest.  I guess since my cleric is starting to get "up there" questions are presenting themselves.  (and yes I consider 31 up there or at least getting that way lol).<P>#1 - Considering I have been playing the game for a long time this is a rather stupid question but I don't believe I am really clear on what people consider "uber".  My cleric has 162 wisdom and some nice items including a crystal covered shroud, gauntlets of the ardent, greaves of the penitent, so on and so forth. Everything that my Lv 30 druid could buy/quest for her.  I wouldn't consider that uber.  So what IS uber exactly?  Some level 50+ twinking out their new lv 1 bard in full lambent sort of thing (which I'm sorry, I disagree with heavy twinkage but that's a topic for another day)?<P>#2 - I'm getting a bit frustrated with guilds I've been in.  It seems like they only care about raids for 40+ members (or even some in the 30's but you're so low end you know you're going to die over and over again).  At what level do guild leaders actually starting seeking you out as a cleric or druid to "get involved"?  Do I have a long wait ahead of me?<P>#3 - Another stupid question.  I get asked all the time what my main character is.  Truthfuly speaking, I don't know!  My druid and cleric have been in contention for that role for quite some time.  What things should one consider in actually choosing one as a main and the other(s) as alts?  This may be a really silly and inconsequential question but it's nudging away at me.  If I had to answer the question which one do I enjoy playing the most and would want to see get to 60...my cleric.  Yet my druid is easier to play and thus has the trade skills (or working on them) and makes the money (to support my cleric) and has skills maxed out like sense heading, foraging, tracking, etc etc where the cleric doesn't have hardly any other skills beyond the regular ones maxed.  The druid gets the most play time but not for fighting mostly for working on things.  So who is my main?  I can't answer that one.<P>#4 - LAST ONE:  I'm starting to look forward to those cool cleric spells starting at level 34.  I've read many of these posts about Cel Heal, Mark of Kahn (or however you spell it), Cel Elixer.  At what point should I have more than one type of heal memmed at the same time?  Right now it's G-heal all the way.  The rest are a figment of the past (unless I'm doing newb charity which I often do).  And, do these spells ever look different then the plain old heal?  I'd like to think when I cast my first Celestial Heal the heavens will open up or something (of course that will not happen) but I hope healing spells at least get some creativity graphicly speaking beyond the 24/39 circle of blue stars.<P>I'm sorry for all these questions.  I've been considering them for quite some time and just decided to risk looking like a nOOb and asking.<P>Thanks!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>1)  I really can't answer what Uber is.  Everyone's opinon seems to vary on this.  All I can say is that I FELT uber when I got my full suit of EM armor (it was my first matching armor!)  Now I see everyone in Thurg/SS/ToV, I am starting to feel like a newb again..hehe<P>2)  If you have a lot of mid level characters in your guild (30-40) you probably won't be called upon to raid until you hit 46-47.  Even in a mid level guild, they may wait until you get Complete heal, before "needing" you.  You are required to be 46 to enter the Planes, so if your guild raids there (or other higher zones) expect to wait til at least 46ish.<P>3)  Can't really help you here either.  My main is my cleric.  She was my first, she is my highest.  She is not my favorite tho.  I prefer my shaman at the moment (probably though just because I need a break from being the main healer <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif">)<P>4)  When you get Superior healing is probably when you will start keeping multiple heals learned.  GHeal will do fine for your casters/hybrids, but SupHeal will be much better for your main tanks.  Then when you get Complete heal, a whole new world of healing opens up. (Just to go off track a sec, I recommend learning how to use complete heal in a group that you are comfortable with.  It can be a difficult spell to learn to use, with the 10 second cast, and the power to heal from 1hp to full health.  Go out and experiement with it!)<P>All heals have the same blue stars (but as you get higher you get to see a hella lot more of 'em!)<P>One last thing, don't be sorry for asking questions, it is what these boards are for.   I only wish I had known about them when I was younger:P<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14272" TARGET=_blank>Phalia Kordain</A><BR>56th Templar<BR>Lords of Belterra<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Thanks I think that pretty much covers it although I need to add one more.<P>#5 - Do any of you ever have trouble getting TO the group?  For example, today I got a gorup in OT that wasn't easily accessible.  I tried to make it there on my own but was nearly killed by a tiger and had to zone. Are clerics slow runners by nature?  Mine is extremely so, agonizingly so.  I hate to ask people to do this, but does anyone ever ask someone in a group they are planning on joining to come pick them up if they can especially if it's not a short walk or you're not completely sure how to get there?  I'm a little embarassed to ask for help this way and I'm just wonderingi f anyone else ever has the same problem as a cleric?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I now have days where I sometimes have 5 heals memmed ; ) (remedy, CH, Cel elixir, DL, and a big group heal) Usually just 4 though, at level 59 )<P>At your level, 1 or 2 is fine. When you get SH, 2 is going to be minimum. At CH level, some (including me) would argue that 3 heals should be memmed minimum. After that, 3 should be fine to 54. At that point, many clerics do ok with only 3 heals memmed, while others start memming DL along with all the other heals )<P>As for travelling, you may have had it hard, but most other non-FD non-invis classes have it harder ) Clerics can be dang hard for a outdoors random creature to kill, if played right. You have root, you have fear, you have 2 different invuln spells, and you can heal yourself all the way to tomorrow ) sow or jboots on top of that would make you dang near invincible during travel, unless a giant or dragon clobbers you in velious.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I would keep at least 2 heals up. I've been doing that since 24. When you have barely any mana and someone needs a heal, your level 14 healing spell might keep them alive. But once you get to 34, you definetly must keep Gheal in addition to Sheal up, since you won't be healing your casters with Superior Heal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Asking is the only way to learn.  I had several clerical mentors when I switched from a warrior but still found questions to ask here.  So we have all been there no worries!<P>Uber: Well everyone thinks of Uber differently.  I consider it being decked out in the best gear, having rare spells and being really really good at what you do.  I dont think Im Uber, though I now have Akkirus armor and Donals legs.  I dont have my epic (Fear the dolly!) but hope to someday.  I would feel pretty uber in full SS and an epic.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Your goal now should be to raise your wisdom as its begining to play a larger role in your mana pool.  Dont sacrifice to much AC though as clerics end up taking beatigns for heals frequently.<P>Mid level Guilds:  Well, depending on your server, those may be hard to find.  Well established guilds will do more for the 45+ crowd, new guilds may push to do raiding, again 45+.  Look to small guilds or role play guilds that have a bulk of people your level.  Or just establish a good bunch of friends.  Try staying in one place for several weeks, helps to get familiar with people.<P>Multiple Characters: Bah! I used to be a warrior, got to 51 and created a cleric.  I love my cleric but I have a 21 shaman, 18 rogue, 12 necro.  Dont fret over a label.  Play what makes YOU happy.  I like the term "Alt" because to me an alternate character is just another choice to make, not better or worse.<P>Spells: I keep 5 to 6 heals mem'd.  At 56 I know I have more options then a level 31, but I have always felt this way.  The more heals I mem the more equiped I will be to heal no matter what.  Keep your best heal, keep your second best, keep a fast heal, keep a group heal.  But that is my opinion and I am pretty much at the mercy of my group to keep me safe.  So its a trade off.  I keep remedy, Cel Heal, Divine Light, Complete Heal, Heroic Bond mem'd pretty much always.  That leaves 2 invulns up 24/7 and one spot to swap in stun/nuke/buff/root situation depending.<P>Travel Trouble:  Now this could be a result of the spells I keep mem'd but I have a hard time travelling.  I need an armed escort pretty much everywhere I go.  I ask people to meet me at the zone or follow a different group around till I get to where I am needed.  Dont be embarassed or feel bad, if a group NEEDS you, they will get you to them! If that doesnt work, mention frequently your only play defense, and travel is the forte for those on Offense.  Buy SoW potions.  Buy invis potions.  Things that will help you avoid the conflict first off.  Root, fear, atone work but you have to be able to cast the spell, and if the mob(s) wont let you, your in deep trouble!  My usual goal is to slip by unnoticed first off or have someone guard me.  The only time I feel most equiped to cross a dangerous zone? Sirens Grotto because I can invuln past those blasted seahorses and be on land before it wears off, muahaha!  /shouts Crazy Cleric training WW zone! Flee for your lives.<P><BR>I love being a cleric.  I love saving people, helping them with rez's or buffs.  Its a calling.

</FONT><HR>1) "uberness' is a combination of loot and skills I would have to say.  Especially when the loots are items that are often awarded to that particular person.  <P>A level 1 cleric decked in full donals is just a twink however.  <P>2) It depends on the level of the guild and what they are going to raid.  Don't worry about a guild till your in your late 40's.  Experience the game, places, get xp and loot.<P>3) I play a 60 druid and a 60 cleric.  My druid was my first character, but as I got frustrated with the life of a druid I picked up the reins of a cleric who is now my main.  By making my cleric my main, that means that I shouldn't expect anything for my druid, who I still actively play, so that other druids in the guild have a chance at it.  You can't simply change main's on a day to day basis, it's a permanent thing.  The 'main' concept help alleviate the amount of loot, which is often to little.  You kill a Vox/Naggy, they drop commonly about 3-4 pieces of loot, how do you divide that among 30-40 people?  Seniority of course, but you can't really have seniority with a secondary.<P>4) I would always have 2 heals up at your level, the highest one you can cast and the one right below it.  Sometimes, the smaller heal when your pretty much oom makes a difference.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I won't respond to several of your questions because others have done better than I will.<P>As for guilds... you don't say what server you're on.  If you're in a guild where you're on the low end as far as levels, you're not going to get to go on many main raids until you level up.  In all likelihood, you'll level faster for time spent on EQ than higher level folks, though, so it will even out a bit.<P>One of my guildmates is in a similar position and has come up with a wonderful solution, which she calls "Die with Aaree night."  She picks a day or time when either there's no guild raid, or a guild raid that won't involve everyone, and sets up a raid.  She invites friendly guilds (especially one our guild likes a lot, and which averages lower level characters).  And folks who want to play their alt or twink go too, as do other folks on the lower level end of the guild.  Suddenly the 30 somethings have raids, get to interact a lot more with guildies and friendly guilds, we all practice important skills AND, by learning them from another point of view, have the chance to become better players.  We get a chance to see dungeons we may not have seen much (or at all) with our mains.  And most important, folks have fun.  She just started these, and things seem to be building.  <P>So, let me suggest you get yourself a map of Dalnir or somewhere else of appropriate level, you learn the map and consult with your guild's raid leaders, and you arrange to lead a raid.  All you need is a few folks and you can have good fun and practice invaluable skills.  You'll also develop as a raid leader and raider, and that will make you an even more valuable guildmember.<P>Don't worry if you only have one group to start with, but give it a couple raids for people to get used to the idea, to find a time when it works well, to let folks see what fun you're having.  If it works, you'll have a lot of fun at it, show your guildmates that you're interested in raiding and good at it, and learn some different zones.<P>If you provide the fun at a time when people can make it, and in an area that's interesting, they'll come!<P>Good luck, Hende</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Who is your main is actually an insult to you. Everyone assumes anyone who is playing has 2 or 3 level 60 characters and if you are playing a 31 cleric then that cleric MUST be a twink, so they want to know who your level 60 character is. The only answer you can give to that question is "This is my main now" and let them work it out for themselves.<P>As far as Uber, well, at one point, Uber was Full EM + Epic. Nowadays, even Thurgadin armor (Forbiden Rites) is considered newbish. Full Kael or Skyshrine armor + Epic or better + other NToV/WW/Kael gear.

</FONT><HR>2)It's hard to see how much lower levels slow down raids as a lower level player.  As a cleric, you'll be accepted lower then anyother class atleast.<BR>  <BR>Low levels: <BR>a) draw more agro, mobs know your an easy target and might decide to make you desert.<BR>b) resist less.  I can't tell you how much the lower levels slow down a WW raid... they don't resist a thing, do minimal damge and require lot's of healing and maybe a few res's. <BR>c) Add to the lag.  Less is more very often, and when you have a sizeable gathering of people in EQ, things slow down.  The people your gonna cut first are the people who do the least.  <P>5) learn /loc.  <p>[This message has been edited by Twinskey Bab0linskey (edited 11-28-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just adding to the wealth of info already given!<P>Raiding doesn't really begin until level 45.  Most level 1-45 zones can be completely done with a single balanced group of the appropriate level.  For example Mistmoore, Infected Paw, Tower of Frozen Shadow, etc.<P>You could raid Mistmoore at level 25 though if you brought 4 groups.  However, few guilds do that as it's *really* hard to get people who are just learning to play their class to work together as a team.  You'll notice huge differences in the organization and skill of xp groups as you progress from level 30 to level 40.  It's quite dramatic.<P>As for people coming to get you, yes that's sometimes necessary.  Even a well equipped cleric complete with invis potions, jboots/tboots/sow potions, etc needs help sometimes.  However, OT shouldn't be one of those zones.  Mem your root, atone, and fear spells and you should be fine.  Never travel without a sow if you can help it though -- 95% of all outdoor mobs can simply be outran.<P>One bit of advice though: print out maps and learn to use /loc.  These 2 things will help you greatly.<P>-Fuz<BR>58 Templar, Sol Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Uber: Go look at Fires of Heaven and Afterlife's posted clerics stats and gear. Currently, that is uber, but even they have some item that they want and someone else has. No matter how uber you are, someone else is always better.<P>2 and 4: A cleric's raiding life really doesn't start untill 39, all else is training for that life. Once you get CH, your abilities in a group can be quantified, as the true measure of a cleric is how well they can use this spell in relation to their other spells. relying on this spell TO much makes you just as bad a cleric as never using it will. All those other cool spells you are looking forward to have their place. Learning that place starts with CH, and never ends as long as you play. Find your own style and comfort level with your abilities and spells. Once you do that, people will notice your skill.<P>3: there ARE no stupid questions, if you honestly are seeking the knowledge. SO you don't have ONE character you prefer, that just means you have several "mains". I have a guildmember who has three level 60's, a warrior, rogue, and cleric. She uses whichever is better suited to the task at hand, much like we use the best spell for the time. Is one of her characters her "main"? Are you looking at time played? Gear acquired? Which was made first? Which she likes the most? <P>Who cares if you play one character or 20. if you like them all equally, and you play them about the same ammount, they're ALL your mains.

I cant say I really want to be uber as the best equipped people on my server are the biggest assholes (at least the majority IMO). But even I feel a little more uber every time I get something nice, even when I completed a set of charisma gear, or got my EE bag  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>2) Well I dont know what to say about that... I started in my guild when I was level 24, now im level 49. During all that time everyone in my guild was 45+. They didnt plan events for me, nor do I think they should have. All I can say is that you have to make friends outside your guild to get you through, or get people your level to join your guild. Once you get to level 40 you should be able to group with anyone above you and get experiance, and by that time you should also be able to solo pretty well if you want. About level 40 I starting having a harder time finding groups (and I didnt want to go to DL) so I spent a lot of time soloing. But when you get to level 40+ and youre on a raid that doesnt have any AoE spells you should be accepted pretty well, Superior Heal is as good a patch heal as druids or shamans get and every little bit helps.<P>3) I think your main is the one you play the most. But if your cleric isnt self sufficient than I guess your druid is your main. All you really need to survive are components and food, so its not that hard.<P>4) As soon as you get Superior Healing it would be a good idea to have them both memmed. When I got Valor I used that instead of greater heal except when a druid was in the group. Now at 49 I usually keep complete, superior, and celestial heal up in a group with a good tank. With only rogues, rangers, and monks I drop complete and use the other two. Also I use Word of Health a lot depending on how many people have lost HP in a fight (especially when only the casters and myself have lost hit points), and Resolution to top off the odd half a bulb of health here and there.  It pays to be versatile, some groups just wont fit into the way you want to heal so instead of force them (resulting in death mostly) you have to adapt.<P>5) I dont know how to help you there, I never could do /locs but have a really good mental map of zones, and a good sense of direction so I dont get lost often and Im damn good at dodging mobs. All I can suggest is that you go to <A HREF="http://www.eqatlas.com" TARGET=_blank>www.eqatlas.com</A>  and take a look at thier maps, print them out if you need to. Navigating zones is a lot easier after you get a good image of them from above. Stick to the walls when walking, and dodge the monsters of course. If something attacks you root it and run to the nearest safe spot (a zone or a guard or something). When you get level 34 you get Atone and you dont have to worry too much about wandering mobs after that as long as theyre blue to you. And if you can try and get a SoW, Levitation, or Invisability before you set out depending on how hard you think it will be to get where you are going.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Not much I can add to what the others say except two other slots you did not mention.<BR>You will learn divine aura and divine barrier are some of your best friends.  I highly recommend learning how to use these at lower levels.  It is easier (if that is the right word) to learn about these in dungeons although they could be needed outdoors.  These two spells just may become permanent in your spell slots.  Not everyone may agree, but they sure have helped me through the years.  I also keep three heals memmed at level 51.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

There are different guilds out there that will cater to every need. It's just up to you to find out which one best suits you. And since you know yourself better than anyone, no one can make that decision for you except you. It's like asking what college is a good college to go to and someone recommending Harvard University or Yale University. While they are good schools, would you go there just because someone told you that they were the best? If you are interested in Law ect. then maybe, but what if you wanted to study ...uh *draws a blank* underwater basket weaving? Oh Brell help me...
