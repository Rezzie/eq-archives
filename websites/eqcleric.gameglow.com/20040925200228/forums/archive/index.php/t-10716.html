<br />
Troll Guards in Rathe Mountains.<br />
(2) of them:<br />
Left is a SK, Right is a Shaman<br />
THEY PULL SEPERATELY<br />
Uber-incredible exp up until 48, soloable at 44.<br />
<br />
Directions:<br />
Coming from The Feerrott, head straight until you come to the named scarabs.  Hang a left just past the scarabs.  You will see a tower straight ahead, but be warned, the 2 trolls are at the base of it.  The tree I usually sit at is facing both of the guards, to the right as you are coming up to them.<br />
<br />
Methods:<br />
1) 2 member group:<br />
Suggested partner = Druid.<br />
Snare/Fear the SK, and Nuke until dead.<br />
Med 3 minutes, Fear the shaman's pet which results in a suicide once the shaman is dead. Snare, nuke her to death.  I suggest fearing the SK FAST to prevent the Harm Touch.<br />
NOTE: Buffing yourself is NOT necessary.<br />
2) Solo:<br />
If you have a choice, choose the SK.  The Shaman is too annoying with her roots and DOT's to play nice.  The pet can also become unfeared before she is dead, and him interupting isn't fun.  She will also heal herself, quite annoying.<br />
Buff yourself with: Sybmol, Reso, AoF, Res Magic<br />
Get near the BIG tree facing the two of them, as this is near the range limit of Retro.  Start with full mana.  Cast Retro and start backing up.  HT ensues, oh well.  root fast.  Back up until limit and retro again. Stun, root, Retro. Holy Might = Dead.  You should be down about 2.5 bbls of mana, and have enough time to med back to full after a GHeal for the next time he pops.  And I have a wis of 186.<br />
<br />
This has to be, by far, the best exp I have found time wise, that is doable by me.  I hate spectres because of their ability to pull multiples.  This is very safe exp simply because of the fact that you can pull singles easily.  And I have found also that you and a partner can get exp just as well as when soloing just the SK.  The repop on each of them is approximately 6 minutes, very fast.  I have also seen groups of four there at level 35.<br />
<br />
I would also like to mention that there are NO roamers in the area, such as HG's or Cyc's.  You can med and camp without fear of dying at all.  I would suggest binding in Feerrott though, as this is the closer of the two zone points IMO, though I haven't measured.  And being a DE, there are 3 dark bargainers directly behind me that I can sell at.  I have to gate and run to Ogguk to bank, not that bad of a run though.<br />
<br />
You will lose faction, but being a DE cleric, with Ogguk and Grobb next door to each other, and me spending way more time in Feerrott, specially with the druid portal there, I chose to sacrifice my troll faction.  IMO, it was well worth it.<br />
