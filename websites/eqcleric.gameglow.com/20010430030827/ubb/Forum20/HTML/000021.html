</FONT><HR>  My observations from the new POH;<P>  First floor drops are ridiculously high now, we seriously got 3 or 4 full suits in our first clearing post patch, including at least one full set of EM, and a full set of ROG armor.<BR>  Maestro didn't seem to be upgraded much, if any, we ended up with a bad pull with him and ~3 mobs to zone in, and had 2 deaths total.  His loot was unchanged, Evensong, and monk mask.  When he died however, a green con "Hand of Maestro" spawned, indiff con, and wouldn't respond to hails, so we killed him, and he dropped the war epic piece, might be a guaranteed item now with every maestro kill, still don't understand why the hand had to spawn, but anyhow.<P>  Second floor is the worth pathing, if *any* that I have seen in my life.  It actually makes Icewell look like it was well done.  A lot of mobs get stuck, or won't pursue at all, we ended up doing a lot of it dungeon crawl style, and killing mobs on their spawn points, since you seriously couldn't pull them 2 feet.<P>  Got a ton of new items on the second floor, mobs weren't all that difficult, and Innoruuk is now a god, thats for sure.  Our fight with ~40 people took somewhere around 10-15minutes, very Velious-style encounter.<P>  It looks like Innoruuk drops race specific items, we ended up with 2 IKS only cloaks, a HUM only neckpiece, ERU only shoulder piece, and the Shattered Emerald for RNG epic quest.<P>Just my .02<BR>Khalim Richelieu<BR>  <BR>Note: we don't break from the corner, we break from zone in point.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><BR>    Spent yesterday in Hate as well, and figured I'd add some things here.  First thing to mention is that being high on the walls is no longer "safe".  You'll get HT'd, attacked and everything else.  Run down to the floor and camp out and you'll be fine.<P>    We were headed to pull Maestro and see if he had any new drops or anything.  Well, we started out the way I've always seen it done before:  Clear mobs back to SWC, move everyone to the throne room, clear Maestro's area, pull Maestro.  Well, we got to throne room, got everything cleared and started buffing for Mae, when all the sudden Maestro shows up with a couple of Spites.  Whole raid wiped out.  We figured someone must have wandered and didn't notice and that we'd pay closer attention next time.<BR>    <BR>    One of our clerics camped out, I got rezzed back in and started right clicking.  Just as the last person was popping back in from Rez, Maestro showed up _AGAIN_ and started ripping us into ribbons.  A cleric managed to run back to SWC and camp out.  Our monk pulled all the bodies back there and I started rezzing folks back in.  Again, after about half the folks were rezzed Maestro shows up in SWC and proceeds to kill everyone.<P>    We never did figure out what was happening, but we've got some theories.  After the first time, we kept an eye on folks and there wasn't anyone roaming.  No one was climbing the walls or anything of the sort.  There was a bard playing a song the first two times, but not the third time over at SWC.  In all three cases it was a cleric to die first (ie first aggro).<P>    There was another raid fighting upstairs at the same time, so my thoughts is that perhaps some of the mobs were chainging aggro down to Mae and then the rest was just bad pathing for Mae into our raid group.  Perhaps aggro is linked now on the beginning mobs upstairs to make you "do things in order"?  Anyway, there were also 2 GM's in the zone, so we did consider the idea that they were doing it "on purpose" just to make things difficult, but we all were very much hoping that was not the case.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>    Anyone else see anything along these lines?<P>    Oh, btw, we did finally manage to drop Maestro and he had standard loot, the hand that spawned after was green as mentioned above but he had a LOT of hit points.  Being green he ran at half health--and apparently 5 rangers, 3 druids, 2 SK's and a Necro weren't enough folks for someone to snare before he ran.  *sigh*   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><BR>--<BR>Ethel Etana<BR>54th Super Vicar!<BR>Immortal Vision - Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Did my 2nd day in new hate yesterday. The drops we had, were the worst drops i have ever seen. Got 2 pieces of EM in entire bottem floor clearing, killed lotsa clerics =/. When the minibosses are up, drops are great because they always drop 2 pieces of armor, but since they weren't spawned (2day spawn maybe? 3day?) drops were crap. After doing bottem floor, we decided to move to 2nd. Our puller couldn't get any of the mobs which spawn behind the inny area (new area) to come, so we decided to charge. First fight, we had 4 mobs and people were dropping fast, so we retreated back to the old inny area, and they could not pursue us. This will probably get nerfed soon, but if you are in trouble on 2nd floor, just back off and they won't follow, camp out and try again. CR was very easy there. Was really dissapointed with drops, and hopefully the minibosses will be spawned tonight.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Adding a little about my first trip back to hate.<P>2 groups from another guild were clearing stuff on the first floor, so we headed up towards the 2nd floor.<P>We killed the hand of Maestro which popped another hand - can't remember name of it - looks just like the re-animated hands - ended up dropping a piece of the warrior epic.<P>Killed one of the cleric mini bosses - had cleric EM BP and cleric EM boots.<P>Killed one of the bard mini bosses - had bard BP and bard legs (I think).<P>Killed a few dozen other things that I don't remember names of.<P>1 pull we had 2 of the elite dragoons and they were pretty tough.  I CHed one of the warriors in my group and immediately got the beat down by one of the dragoons.  Backed up in the throng of the crowd and managed to get DA off.  Sat down to med up with the dragoon still beating on me.  <P>DA wore off, got popped for about 275 a couple times and then was healed a couple times from other people, but still had the dragoon beating on me.  <P>Casted DB and sat down to med.  Dragoon was still trying to beat on me.  Continued to try to beat on me until they killed it with about 5 seconds left on DB.<P>Later that night, only had DA to use and died after it wore off and the another dragoon was still beating on me.<P>A lot of the stuff seems to have really bad pathing.  The sages seem to be the worst.  Had one room where we just couldn't get a sage to come out, so we ended up charging the room.  Then the sage got backed up into a corner and was getting healed from outside.<P>LD city and a dragoon wandering or popping in the room caused a big mess.<P>Agro range seems to be very low up there though for some stuff.
