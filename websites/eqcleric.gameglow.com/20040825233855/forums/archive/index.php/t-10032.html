I mean everyone is always saying how nice it is to be about to make big pp with 90% rezzes. I don't know what game there playing but I almost always walk away from a rezz with just a thank you. Don't get me wrong I am very grateful for the thank you and would rezz anyone who couldn't pay but where do peeps get such a crazy idea that clerics are rich for rezzes :P Sorry I just needed to vent. I feel better now  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">07-08-2002, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The people who believe that clerics must be rich probably do not have a 49+ cleric, are possibly unguilded druids or necros who died in far distant regions while soloing and had to bribe clerics heavily to get them out there for a rez so they think clerics make jillions based on their limited exposure to rezzing, are used to getting 20-50 pp for a mere port and figure rezzing must bring in a lot more since it's a more important service, and, finally, are the type of people who would find playing a cleric boring but wouldn't hesitate to gouge people for big money so they figure everybody does.<br />
<br />
Rezzing doesn't bring in a lot of money because: <br />
<br />
1) clerics and paladins can both rez, and decent rezzes are available at more levels now for clerics,<br />
2) clerics with click sticks almost never charge unless they have to travel (mana-free, you see), <br />
3) there are a lot of high level clerics around now, at least in the more populated regions, so we do not get tons of rez requests per capita (I get one or two a night, usually from mid-level people who cannot afford to pay much),<br />
4) most rezzes are done for free (unguilded thirty-somethings don't have a lot of cash so we usually rez them pro bono or for a reduced amount, and no one expects soloing monks to carry around cash for rezzes),<br />
5) a lot of clerics do not charge for rezzes ever because they are extremely nice,<br />
6) most people are in guilds, and guild clerics rez guildmates for free.<br />
<br />
Clerics are, in fact, NOT rich.  Not only are we not paid anything most of the time for our rezzing, we are also underpaid for buffing.  <br />
<br />
I see enchanters being offered 100pp for KEI all the time, while I sometimes get offered a peridot for Aegolism, but usually no dot and just 10-20pp, for a spell which costs a dot and almost twice as much mana as KEI.  Oh, and Group Aego requests are even more insulting (group aego costs 2000 mana and four peridots, that's five times the mana of KEI and 42pp minimum just for dots, so please, tailor your monetary offer accordingly).<br />
<br />
It is Aegolism requests that make me go /anon, not rez requests, which are far less common these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">07-08-2002, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correction: KEI is 900 mana, not 400, so group aego is just over twice as much mana, but still costs 4 peridots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cland</div><div class="date">07-09-2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the aego requests are getting kinda anoying, Someone offered me 30 pp for group aego the other day /boggle<br />
<br />
And Res requests are too bad nowadays.<br />
<br />
The people who think Clerics are rich are the ones who tell you and offer you 200pp to come res them (which you won't get most the times) and get all uppity when you say: No I'm killing Celinik Ican't come to South Karana to res you.<br />

<br />
I think it's the same reason that people think a high level druid is rich. Or a wizard. Or enchanter. They know someone, or read somewhere, that so-and-so druid / wiz / ench / cleric made 100k porting / porting / jewelcrafting / rezzing and figure that everyone of that class is capable and interested in doing the same. I know druids who talk about buying this and that multi-k item and wonder how the heck they do it. I've met clerics who the minute they got the 90% res scribed hung up their shingle and started advertising. These people tend to be the exception, not the rule.<br />
<br />
No, it's not right, and usually not even accurate, but it is very like human nature.<br />

<br />
They usually are confused. I say &quot;dude clerics are ALWAYS broke.  Go beg an enchanter or a Druid.  they get phat money from ports.&quot;  I usually say go to kelethin a bunch of druids there.<br />
<br />
I often feel like Foghorn Leghorn telling whe weazel where to get chickens.  <br />
<br />
I guess the sad part is i AM always broke</div></div><hr />

I'll never turn down a port for C3/Aego trade though hehe. <br />
<br />
Druids, Clerics and Chanters need to always help each other in my opinion for just that reason, each of us has something the others want and with the exception of the cleric it costs us nothing but time.<br />
<br />
Also I just noticed how many of your buffs require reagents, I'll not be complaining about carrying bat wings and fish scales anymore (and the not expended fire beetle eye):P</div></div><hr />

It's a bit sneaky, and doesn't always work. And it won't by ANY means ever make you rich.  But it will cut down on the number of peridots you spend on secondary tanks.<br />
<br />
I give secondary tanks symbol of Pinzarn if they don't give me peridots and they demand symbols.  I also use Pinzarn for Shamans and Necros so they can eat themselves a bit longer.<br />
<br />
Most people never even know the difference.  And if they do, then I tell them, &quot;If you're smart enough to know which symbol I gave you, you're smart enough to know how much it costs to chew through a half a stack of Peridots on a secondary tank/shaman/necro/etc.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falene</div><div class="date">07-18-2002, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't charged or accepted a donation for a rez in quite a long time.  I did when I first got my level 49 rez, but after that I personally felt bad doing so.  If I can rez, I will.  If I can't, I have no problem politely declining.  I have yet to be flamed for refusing to rez.<br />
<br />
As far as dots go, on my server it is standard practice that the cleric gets the gems to cover their costs, plus their fair share of the gem split after that.<br />
Of course, not every zone has good gem drops, but in the end I think it all works out pretty fair.<br />
<br />
My guild also supplies all gems on guild raids.  This is the one thing that has kept me from being dirt poor.  My first guild wasn't like that and I was always always broke.<br />
<br />
In normal raiding situations, I will symbol the tank, enchanter and if we have one, the shaman with Marzin.  The rest, including myself, get Pinzarm.  If I find someone else is taking heavy damage, I will Marzin them as well.  Of course, sometimes the whole group should have it and I have no problem doing that.  Just like I don't tell someone how to play their char, I don't expect someone to tell me how to buff.  My goal is always no deaths, though that isn't always possible, and I buff with that in mind.<br />

<br />
Yep, I buff with Dots to the MA, puller (in raid situations, if regualr grp just pinzarn), chanter... i will always pinzarn the shammy, necro, and others...depending on the situation and the damage taken... for expanle if the drood is the designated snarer then they get pinzarn...etc  <br />
<br />
I tend to buff pinzarn quite freely since the 8gp is nothing compared to the focus and mana it takes away from the MA, if i have to heal others.  <br />

You shouldnt be casting the BEST buffs possible if your in a decent to Excellent group. Here is a prime example of the group I was in with a greedy cleric:<br />
<br />
Location: Karnors Castle, Live group, Group: monk/warrior/chanter/shaman/wizard/cleric<br />
<br />
As you can tell VERY well rounded group for the live camp. As you most know Monks arent the richest people in game. Yes there are those few out there who are wielding Tstaffs and Fungi's but other than that they got quest armor and crap gear.<br />
<br />
Well low and behold a Opal bracelet drops.. for me being an iksar monk it sells for around 35-40pp to a vendor.. pays for my bandages, throwing stars, food and water.. note I cant carry alot of this stuff at a time with my weight restrictions.<br />
<br />
Next thing I know cleric is going OooO! Gem please give. WTF is up with that??? she starts telling me that shes been symboling the tanks, chanter, and her. I never recieved ONE single Symbol the whole time from this particular cleric while in group. Yet she still persists to tell her HER costs of the gems she uses and such. basically I tell her.. Not my problem. I never recieved a single symbol from you, hence let the Tank and chanter give you their lewts. In the end I end up saying screw it, gave her the bracelet and told the group to find another monk for my reasons expressed above.<br />
<br />
Then this thing gets blown outta purportion and such, with her going into /ooc to try and turn zone against me. But I wont get into that because Im not as low as this holy priest.. <br />
<br />
but my point is some of you clerics out there need to lay off when tryin to hog all the good selling vendor lewt and let your local monk keep some of it. Ive seen more EXCELLENT equipped clerics than I have ever seen monks on my server.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant but in my opinion it needed to be said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiyre</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*cough*<br />
<br />
how to reply to that post<br />
<br />
To start, no, I'm not defending the cleric since I play a cleric, but its easy to just look at this from an efficiency point of view to see where cleric is come from<br />
<br />
It is a cleric's JOB to use the best buffs on the main tank and the chanter at the very least.  Why?  because symboling the main tank increases the efficiency of complete heals, and thus allows the group to fight more mobs = more experience for YOU.  Symboling the enchanter is important as well because the enchanter is the fragilist of the group, and are likely to draw aggro with a broken mez/resists, and enchanters can be very critical to keep a group alive.  Keeping the enchanter alive=more safety to the group. Keeping the MT fully buffed=more efficient ch'es.  All clerics worth their stuff know this and practice this.  <br />
<br />
Other members of the group, such as you the monk should simply not be taking a lot of hits.  As a monk with fd and mend, you must be able to successfully pull to the group while taking little or no damage, especially in a group makeup such as that, symboling you is simply not as necessary as symboling the mt and enchanter.  Symboling the cleric increases safety, but isn't necessary really.<br />
<br />
You are seriously complaining about buying food and water?  You do realize that you can ask the cleric in your group to summon you water and food, and you do realize that you don't need bandages in a group too right?  As well, these, and items to throw don't cost 10.5pp (with good charisma) EACH<br />
<br />
 Not my problem. I never recieved a single symbol from you, hence let the Tank and chanter give you their lewts.<br />
<br />
That makes 0 sense, i hope you realize.  Symboling the enchanter and tank is good for the safety and efficiency of the GROUP, hense since the group performs better, they can pull more mobs and you will gain more experience. That is what you get.  And you are saying that other people should be paying out of their own pocket to give you more safety and experience?  How selfish.<br />
<br />
Symboling costs, since they increase the efficiency of the entire group, are to be shouldered by the entire group.  Do you really not see the logic of this? <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feckl</div><div class="date">09-02-2002, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno about anyone else but between buying spells, spell components, buffing the newbies in GFay and going to buy more spell components, I'm almost ALWAYS broke. The rare case was when someone in my guild left my server and gave me all their items and money. They left me behind a nice wad of 1.4k, so I splurged and bought myself a Dark Ember in Bazaar for 650pp. I also decided that &quot;what the hell, I'm rich&quot; and blew the rest of the money the guildie gave me on just random crap, such as bags full of food and water and components, which are necessary, and unnecessary junk like some cheap gear and throwing a couple pp to anyone who asked.<br />
Also, clerics rarely get paid for rezzing. However, druids and wizzies can charge up to 100pp for a port, which is retarded since usually it requires very little travel, unless you count the actual port itself.<br />
I never expect a group member to pay for a rez, considering that the reason they died was because I couldn't get a heal off fast enough/I died first/I ran oom. However, if you rez some random kid in the zone, it would be nice if I got some sort of cash or even a thank you from them.<br />
So to all the other classes who constantly harrass a cleric for a rez, please tip your cleric. )</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for not getting resentment for not rezzing you're one lucky bastige...many people can't seem to understand that you don't want or can't rez/PL/buff/heal/cure them. Once a wizard died and sent me a tell like &quot;can you rez me? I'll port you to where corpse is and port you back&quot;. I was doing some trading in EC tunnel back then. No mention of donation, no please nothing. So I said nop, I'm busy and he started telling me he'd never ever port me again, that i'm a bitch etc...even went to use open channels for his rants and raves. I ignored him. Can't stand people like that. Well now he changed his name...guess he flamed a bit too much :p.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monk</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I hear you &quot;I spend 1.5kpp a week in peridots.&quot; <br />
hmm those are some nice fast fists he has there. <br />
wonder what haste's that monk is using.<br />
wonder what AC that monk has.. he sure can take alot of hits.<br />
oh oh and that damage! sure we are the best dmg out put!<br />
<br />
Not all players do that, but hey not all players. and again not all spells are the same. If you ever noticed that all that time standing could have saved you a few peridots. To kill MAJOR mobs, like certain dragons, and such take major shielding..<br />
a mob falls because of what reason? damage damage damage. a melee class can get rid of a mob faster is be cause of what.. dmg type buffs. <br />
<br />
just think you cast one blast spell on a mob.. hmm thats 300-600 hp you just knocked off it. plus it saves on those BIG hits you get every now and then.. which means less of a heal.. which means same amount of mana.. maybe more maybe less.. and you still keep your dots. <br />
<br />
Most a mellee really cares about are dmg ac hp type buffs.. usually Haste and str (in my case anyways) I knwo clerics get some hp/ac buffs that dont use peridots.. we'd be happy withjust those.. this way you still have mana for that extra heal instead of casting a peridot.<br />
<br />
oh yeah.. how much ac does he have?? 1100+AC. inluding a Fungi to help out with you not having to spend your Peridots or any other type of spell. you chose to cast that spell you should ask to donate 2pp towards your spell to pay for a peridot up front. just tell them its for your peridots to repay for them.  Sounds reasonable.<br />
<br />
Just like we dont ask you for money to help us pay for our damage output, our AC, and our weapons on a day to day period. You want to live, your tank better have the best gear... how does he get that gear.. hmmm seems we are forced to solo to get our decent/top notch gear to protect your butts from getting agro and killing you.. then the enchanter then who ever else is left to be eatin plus ourself...<br />
<br />
I know a raid where I my guild was fighting Faydedar in TD. I got the killing blow, plus I was one of the last ones standing. Im only lvl 52. Ive seen lvl 60's with worst gear than me.. which monk would you want to have protectin you.. the one in 80k+ gear or the one in Wu's. Not saying Im boasting about my equip. not by far. but those extra hp's/AC, dmg output, and the rest of the mumble jumble to protect the group doesnt come cheap.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caudex</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally it would just be easier if everybody carried peridots.  1.5k a week my ass, went through 2k in the last 2 days because I've been wasting too much time online trying to raid and get mgb.   <br />
<br />
The &quot;monk&quot; posts didnt even make sense to me.  Everybody pays for food and water and if its that big a deal a mage will make you all that saving 5pp and mostly likely be happy to do so.   Yes, you can solo to farm cash and we can't.  You will notice when you get a paper thin cleric with no mana pool.  Maybe we need gear less noticeably but it isnt negligible and you dont buy spells.  Not sure how that was an argument that we need cash less.<br />
<br />
It will cost any 44 plus cleric 20pp an hour or more to group unless you are A. killing bixies B. Stupid.  I pity any fool that doesnt symbol the chanter and MA at the very least.  Yes thats only 100pp for your avg grind session no where near as noteworthy as food/drink/bandages/something to chuck at the mob(hi bracer of summon stuff to throw).   <br />
<br />
If you look at an average cleric showing up for a raid that can range from 80-800pp easy.  Thats not really the issue though we're talking groups.  Its really VI's attempt to moderate how much pp is in the game I think, but either way it costs money for us to be effective.  If clarity or haste required a peridot we'd cast it.  I need to do my job in a group, so I cast it.  If one out of 5 groups doesnt wipe and kills faster its worth that atleast 500pp to keep the chanter alive and waste less mana on the MA.  It doesnt really matter when you hit group symbol and aego because A. pretty much everybody needs it B. Theyre getting it anyhow, but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
Profit sharing is great.  I dont really hold people responsible for the groups in most zones where all I do is lose money by the hour.  However if a decent amount of pp does actually drop I think I should atleast make out as well as the rest of the group.  If I drop 100pp and we all get 50pp thats me getting screwed not sharing.  If a cleric demands every gem drop in seb, well they probably didnt use that much in gems and theyre screwed up.  Maybe theyre bitter from all the other zones where they were just bled dry and nobody really gave any notice.  It is true joy to check the old bank and say &quot;hey cool I'm about 500pp up&quot; then reallize you need to buy 9 stacks of dots to replenish the supply. <br />
<br />
Damage is great and all.  That 30k haste belt and all the other toys are just dandy.  If the chanter dies it really doesnt matter.  If you die it will make the corpse that much more uber.  It all matters.<br />
<br />
In actually keeping with the thread people assume clerics/chanters/wiz/enc/and yes even the relatively farmable monks are rich because the grass is always greener and people are dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Melee purchase eqpt that is hopefully going to last them for quite a few lvl's or until they win/awarded a better item in a raid or pickup group. They have very little maintenance cost's other than their initial expenses. Cleric's and Enchanters (Wizzies to a degree) have ongoing cost's to lay out and don't forget *back in the day* when clerics were sat there staring at a spell book (most casters actually) , all the melee were looting corpses as soon as they dropped. Very few people had a ML in Oasis or SolA etc etc.<br />
<br />
Yes, some Clerics did *milk* the situation but then again some Clerics have been screwed over royally with people looting all the drops and logging/leaving without sharing the wealth.<br />
<br />
Personally i don't *charge* for a res. If someone offers to pay me something, then fine, if they ask me how much i say that's your choice. If someone thinks they have a god-given right to a res from me *just becasue* i can, they can go take a run and jump :)</div></div><hr />

As a shaman, I didn't have much problem, and the times I couldn't find a group, I would just solo, had no patience, but when I started playing a monk and got him to like 52, it would take me average maybe 40 minutes to find a decent group anywhere.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I agree with the false assumption that clerics are rich because of rezzes, and I know this first hand because I'm one of those losers who offers 1k+ for a rez if it's out of the way :D  But that's because I know they don't really make that much money off regular rezzes and that I have to give them that much more incentive to come rezz my (_|_).  <br />
<br />
Gem cost:  This can be annoying, but not if you play it smart.  Some zones will yield you no gems to reimburse  symbol/aego costs, but others will, and pretty generously, like sebilis.  But a lot of the grind zones suck for gem drops and you're stuck with having to hunt in them sometimes.<br />
<br />
One other alternative is setting up a group of friends and farming PoH/PoG for gems.  PoG becoming increasingly trendy now because pog's won't aggro anymore when someone kos turns visible in zone.  In those 2 zones, you can hog gems like a beast, split it 6 ways, and still make everyone happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have BoA (group aego = 2000mana + 4 peridots per cast).<br />
<br />
Suuure I could cast single aego...and take 5 times longer to buff the people. Yep I can do single aego on my group's shaman and main tank. My other groupmates and me however would die in a matter of secnds when doing stuff like the caller quest in FG or when having a bad pull.<br />
<br />
I'm a cleric. My job is to heal my group and keep them alive. I don't give a **** about that &quot;monk&quot; thinks because monks (assuming he is a monk) can FD when low HP and have mend. Tell a wizard who is burning all his mana on a mob to kill it asap or the group will wipe. They'll draw aggro and will be happy for the added 1.1k HP I gave them. The group will also be happy because the HP allowed me to keep the wizard alive and thus he could channel a few more nukes effectively killing that bad mofo and saving the group.<br />
<br />
So these are maybe extremes but such things can still happen. There are times where you can't do other than split tanking, especially in places where you can't mez anything.<br />
<br />
sure I'd never use group aego or even aego in a place like KC unless it's for VS. but hey, it's been a good while since I've grouped in there with my cleric. In places like FG (caller quest), Kael, SG, AR, etc giving all of the group 1.1k more HP will save your butt. and to save YOUR butt I'm using 1.5k+pp per week. and I let people also get some gems. I only wish to get enough to cover for the peridots I used in THAT group.<br />
<br />
My dear &quot;monk&quot; please get a clue before telling clerics who have 150+ days played on the CLERIC how they should use buffs.<br />

I don't use as many peri's as you guys say, but then i'm not lvl 60 with BoA yet either.  the custom on our server is for the cleric to keep track of the number of peridots used and the group reimburses from the cash (or gems) collected and THEN we evenly split what's left.  everyone is happy that way.  in places like KC (where cash/loot is harder to come by), i rarely symbol anyone but the MA and chanter, maybe some one else if they seem to take a lot of dmg (e.g. snarer).  places like Seb, to start out, i symbol everyone (breaking the room is always the riskiest time and when more hp on everyone is helpful) then once we get settled, i symbol where i see it needed.  the idea is that when i save myself peridots, i save the GROUP peridots, which makes all of us all the happier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kasane</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My symbol use is different from most people.  I rarely symbol tanks.  They have so much hp that it doesn't make that much of a difference.  I have no trouble keeping them alive.  I sometimes symbol pullers, but it depends on their hp, what they're pulling, and where they're pulling.  In other words, if I think there's a chance that they might need the extra hp to make it back within range of my heals.  I almost always symbol chanters.  They have low hp and draw a lot of aggro.  I also cast symbols on casters who don't know how to manage aggro.  (If I cast one on a druid or wizzie, it kinda means I think they're an idiot, lol.)<br />
<br />
Monk, <br />
The cost of our symbol buffs is not 2pp, it's 11-13pp each.  <br />
<br />
I never charge my group for my symbol costs, don't ask for extra loot, and don't even get my own fair share of the loot.  I should, but don't.  I once spent several hours at the necro camp in Seb and got 4pp.  (Because I got up to loot once.)  I don't think there's anything wrong with asking the group to help pay for symbol costs.  I'm just not aggressive enough to do it.  On the other hand, I have heard stories about greedy clerics who did demand all the gem drops.     <br />
<br />
Now, I do have a problem with the notion that a lot of people don't want to help the cleric cover the costs of symbols unless they are the person receiving them.  Symbols benefit the entire group, not just the person they are cast on (unless that person is soloing).  Symbols on chanters especially, because fights can get messy when the chanter dies.  But this is sticky territory.  It's not fair that clerics should have to shoulder the financial burdens of symbols that help their whole group, especially when some people will think they're greedy if they don't cast symbols.  But why should somebody else have to pitch in for the financial burden of a symbol on somebody if they do not think it is needed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crowgoth</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most a mellee really cares about are dmg ac hp type buffs.. usually Haste and str (in my case anyways) I knwo clerics get some hp/ac buffs that dont use peridots.. we'd be happy withjust those.. this way you still have mana for that extra heal instead of casting a peridot.<br />
<br />
Err, no.<br />
'Ok Mr. Warrior Sir, would you like to have Heroic Bond before you go and tank Tunare? What do I hear you say? You want Aego? I'm sorry that would cost more mana and some peridot, we can't possibly do that! Tell you what, I use the mana I saved on the heal I give you after the rez...'<br />
<br />
None and I repeat NONE of the melee in my guild would prefer an ac/hp buff instead of Aego. NONE.  Aego/symbols etc (those evil little peridot/mana drainers) save lives in groups and on raids.<br />
<br />
Just like we dont ask you for money to help us pay for our damage output, our AC, and our weapons on a day to day period.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you've noticed, but clerics wear equipment too. Equipment that gives us mana.  Mana to heal you so you can have damage output.<br />
<br />
You want to live, your tank better have the best gear... how does he get that gear.. hmmm seems we are forced to solo to get our decent/top notch gear to protect your butts from getting agro and killing you.. then the enchanter then who ever else is left to be eatin plus ourself... <br />
<br />
In a decent guild the tank will get better gear on raids, not soloing.  On raids on which clerics heal/buff/rez.  Not solo. Well unless you're lvl 10 but then you don't need buffs like that.<br />
<br />
I know a raid where I my guild was fighting Faydedar in TD. I got the killing blow, plus I was one of the last ones standing. Im only lvl 52. Ive seen lvl 60's with worst gear than me.. which monk would you want to have protectin you.. the one in 80k+ gear or the one in Wu's. Not saying Im boasting about my equip. not by far. but those extra hp's/AC, dmg output, and the rest of the mumble jumble to protect the group doesnt come cheap.<br />
<br />
Hello? Anyone home? Anyone???<br />
<br />
YOU DON'T BUY HIGH END GEAR.  IT'S 99% of the time NO DROP.<br />
And the only way to get it is by raiding.  Just see above for the Aego thing...<br />
<br />
Invest in your local Mellee its a profit sharing that you know counts and saves your hide.<br />
<br />
No comment, the comedy in that statement speaks for itself.</div></div><hr />

Rich I am not, but I'm not a loot monger either. If I have a group of 6..I wait till we kill 6 beastys and loot that one. If I miss out from a loot mongers snatching everything they get they're greedy hands on.. I politely say hey please share. Usually they do.:) If I still get no loot I just leave the group and go elsewhere. I consider my regents part of the cost of being a cleric...rarely will I say anything unless I'm not getting a 6th of the loot. Works for me! And even though my rezzes are low..I do not charge..it's just mana. If they offer well sure I take it. But rich us clerics are not!</div></div><hr />
