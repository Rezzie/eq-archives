</FONT><HR><BR>Hi everyone,<P>I was considering going into the hole and soloing this guy with good old root and shoot, but someone said it might be a close fight so I'll bring some friends instead (plus, you know, us clerics don't like to show off by soloing big mobs).<P>Can anyone give me some information on the Scalekeeper?  Spawn times?  Approximate difficulty?  Common strategies?   Minimum groups to make it a "good" fight... Minimum to totally kick his arse?  How hard is it to GET to him?  I've actually fought down to Yael guy for the ranger quests.<P>Is it true he only drops Red Scales, and the rusty blade he drops is for an unknown quest?  <P>Does anyone know of any good guides online?  Or can post your personal experiences?<P>Thank you for any information.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>We went down and wacked his butt last night.<P>I just followed everybody else, but apparently he is right in that area if you dropped down the hole from Paineel.<P>He stands in the back far corner and appeared to be indifferent to everybody before attacking him.<P>The strategy we used was similiar to how a lot of people do VS.<P>We had all the casters stand near the wall around the corner from where he was standing.  The melees stood across the way on the little hill near the door that is supposed to lead to the new zone the plane of underfoot or whatever it's supposed to be called.<P>We had 1 tank start the fight and do taunting.<P>About 5 seconds after he pulled the scalekeeper, the rest of the melees jumped in from the back side.<P>We attempted to have 2 enchanters chain rune the main tank, but that severely pissed off the scale keeper and the enchanters died within seconds.<P>From what I heard about him, he life taps about 2x as much as VS does.  His melees are approximately normal - around 300 or so.<P>He dropped a red scale and a rusty thornblade.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>This is actually a fun raid to do - you have to move rather quickly through the Hole to get there, and there are some hairy moments in the city where you can have a few unmezzable golems on you, with a random selection of elementals.  Fun  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>At any rate, if you are mostly low to mid 50s, it takes 3 decent groups to make it to Yael/Nortlav (it can be done with two, but much more risky).  <P>There are two ways to reach him -- one is through the city and down the hall past the Ranger epic quest guy, and take a left just before the undead area; that tunnel leads right down to the Yael area.  Alternatively, if you don't want to bother with that you can attempt to jump off the waterfall just off the city area. . .chanced are most of you will make it if you jump correctly  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Course, if all of your clerics die on the jump, you're pretty screwed.<P>I would use the maps on Belgar's site ([url]http://home.elp.rr.com/wolfclan/alchemy/alchemyindex.html[/url) -- check out the Shaman Epic Quest section, and read up on the part that details how to get to High Scale Kurn -- only instead of going through the undead area, you will go down the side tunnel.  This is a pretty good guide, as the maps show all the spawn points and roamers, as well as the exact path to take to get there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Currently scalekeeper is high on my hit list, We came across this mob, who conned blue and after having just wolloped yael we were feeling cocky.  Boy were we wrong.  A ogre warrior without rune (hey we didn't know what he did) died in less than 5 seconds (CH was started 5 seconds before he agro'd and he was dead on arrival heh :>).<P>Runes tend to annoy the scalekeeper - whereas they don't vs.  From all the info I have, it seems that he does not life tap but simply has a 1.5k or something dd.<P>There is a self only rune for chanters right that is 1k and takes 2 dots? (or was that on test only).  If the enchanter runed a tank, got agro and then rune tanked (ie chained runed to taunt it), ya think ya could get enough nukes off so he would die?  Rooting him might be an idea I guess.  And him being 55 I think makes him a possible fear kit mob :>  What about stuns?  I always thought that 55 was the level where they no longer worked, but someone told me it was 56 so im guessing chain stunning might be a possibility.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>I believe that self rune for enchanters you talk about, was a preliminary Velious spell, but was later not put in (at that time anyhow).<P>This is great information everyone, thanks.  I guess I have a few other questions...<P>1 - What's his spawn time like... are we talking minutes, hours, days, rare, triggered?<P>2 - I've checked Ally's too, and it seems that this guy only drops red scales... is that true?  Or is the Red just far more common?  It won't really matter to us... this is the sort of thing we're looking to do for the first time (oh yes, and that means we may fail miserably, but our enchanter likes to die, so we need some failures)... just cause.<P>3 - Most important to me right now I guess... does he have an AE spell?  Or does he dispell?<P>4 - Can he be slowed?  It looks like he is level 53-55, so can an appropriate level enc/shm land any slows on him?   It appears he hits for 300ish ... that's actually less than the BBQ boy for our epic... is he of comparable difficualty, harder, or easier?<P>5 - Does he cast much else in the way of spells, in any?  Other than the 1500dmg lifetap or DD.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The way we generally get down there is group clerics paladins and necros, and 5 without DA with our level 60 bard.  We all hit divine aura and jump from up at paineel, and the bard starts playing his DA song, and the 5 with him jump (if there are more people, he waits up top until he gets everyone DA'ed and into Hole.<P>Only thing to remember about this tactic is that you will all zone into the same spot, and hang up on each other.  So, as soon as you zone, start moving to make sure you get falling again as quickly as possible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>An excellent thread and I wanted to revisit it and thank everyone again... so thank you.<P>This past weekend I led some fool raiders (they let a Halfling take them into the hole... nuff said).<P>We actually had way overkill for most of the stuff... we started with 7 groups (this is no uber guild or anything, it was an open call for friends to come play in the hole, no one was reasonably being turned away)... that quickly fell to about 5 groups as people LD'd.   Most poeple were 50-52, with a few at 54, and a couple more up to 60.<P>As hairy as the city can be, we had no trouble at all with it... people were pretty on the ball.  We opted to try the ScaleKeeper first.<P>We cleared down to the Scalekeeper with ease... and then as we cleared his room, we found out:<P>- Scalekeeper will agro, if you fight hole mobs near him.  Again, first time down, really werent expecting that... and his agro range was LARGE.   We pull mobs away and then all of a sudden, here comes the scalekeeper.  Kill those mobs and he stops tho, unless someone directly agros him.<P>After we clean up that mess... we're ready to give it a real try.   We have a level 60 warrior as the main tank... we buff him up with all the toys... and he gets ready to attack.<P>Warrior dies before anyone can blink.   Lesson number 2:<P>- Scalekeeper has a nasty harm touch.  Warrior ate the harm touch, then aparently a lifetap, plus melee damge.  <P>Still not daunted... we ressed and buffed the warrior (only he died, no one else had a chance to agro)... and were ready for a 3rd time.<P>I don't believe everyone was ready for the 3rd time... someone gave the command to attack before everyone was ready (this is the sort of stuff that simply gets better the more you fight with people... it sucked, but happened).  Some of us were medding and it's like "soandso has been slain... huh??".   <P>Still, we all jumped into the fight, and had him at about 25% hp when the last of us dropped.  We had a cleric camp out each time so all was good... plus the monks who FD'd.  During our CR we learned Lesson 3:<P>- The Scalekeeper agros when you fight Hole Mob.   That sounds like lesson 1!  Yeah... except remember when you CR near the scalekeeper and a mob wanders down the hall to beat on you... the Scalekeeper will too.... definatly drag and res your bodys AWAY from the scalekeeper.<P>We'd been there quite a long time after all this... and with some people wanting to leave, we just went back to Jael for the 3 rangers we had.   I personally got to see where the enchanter and shaman epics spawn... which was great.   We also got some Imbued Granite Spaulder drops, Loam, and Whithered.<P>I believe for the most part it was a great learning experience... I believe I know the hole very well now... I have the confidence to try this again.   The scalekeeper caused some trouble... but it seemed like it was trouble STARTING the fight... but even when the chaos started, and people started dying, we got him down to less than half hp.  If we could just get the fight started okay, and not have our main tank die asap... I'm sure we could have taken him.<P>Oh yeah, lesson 4:<P>HE REALLY DOES hate Rune.  It was said in this thread, and I warned the enchanters... my one buddy cast 1 Rune 4...and that's it... wasted.<P>Anyhow, thanks for the great info on him.  We'll kick his arse next time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>If you're not totally crazy the best way to get to him is to go into the city and look for the drop-off into the water, invis and take the plunge, then head off to the left and drag the rock golem into the hall with you out of aggro range of Yael. We like to run the whole route because we go down there primarily for ranger/shaman epics, and because it's fun. Just make sure you have a plan for dealing with 4 golems at once.<P>Fight him with a main tank getting about 15 sec of good aggro before other melees jump in. Heal the heck out of the tank - he doesn't aggro healers too much. I wouldn't count on slowing him, as his MR is very high; I wouldn't try to stun him either, as you'll more likely than not be resisted and you don't want to get aggroed by this guy. I don't know how effective runing is other than to say the only time we had an enchanter live through this fight she was OOM and couldn't rune  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> I do believe the proc is a lifetap though so I would go the overwhelm-with-damage-output route.<P>He only drops red scales. The others are merely hopeful rumors and have no basis in fact.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>I actually enjoyed the city run the most I think.  The hole is simply a beautiful place... I recommend everyone who likes to explore partake in a massive hole raid at least once.  The hole is so DEEP (duh, it's a hole)... there's caves, castles, city, tower, waterfall... it's great... the lighting is pretty eerie too.<P>Most poeple there, thought we had the power to take the ScaleKeeper.  Our first wipeout, when he agroed while we cleared a golem/elem, was totally unexpected, and yet, even after CAMP was called... before I poofed I noticed he was at just over 50 percent health.  That was with him being an add, and several people dropping.  However, most of the main tanks were dead at this point... survivors bravely ran him around to let clerics camp - and they did so expertly.<P>The second time... we only had the wipeout on the main tank... he just dropped too fast... WAY faster than anyone expected... heals were started, and never even had a chance to land.  The warrior said he had 4.7k hp, and Rune 4 or 5 on him.  The Harm Touch was just nasty aparently... plus he got procced on.<P>Oh yeah... we tried giving him weapons... he had two longswords when we got there... we gave him 2 daggers, and we gave him a 2HB staff... NONE of these appeared to affect his proccing.  Maybe it does... but people were still saying how they got procced a lot.<P>The final time we tried... I dunno... I'm sure there was a mixup in communication... we were buffing/medding... and ALMOST ready... but the attack call was given by the main warrior... someone ate the HT for him... and we started.  But 3 people died before I even knew the fight started.  /sigh.  Communication is a good thing.  We got him down to about 25-30 percent HP before I called for the low on mana and mostly dead group to try and camp the clerics - it was dang close, but someone did get out to res.<P>But it all doesnt bother me.  I mean... we all know death and waiting for CR SUCKS... but I feel I've learned a lot about the hole... and got to see first hand how this big guy fights.  I'll be more ready for him next time.   Communication within these group is getting better and better the more we raid... this was the 6th raid together for a core set of people.  I do believe each week we get better.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><BR>/cry<P>I never got to be a noob with a pet... *sniffle* dang clerics... <P>Actually if that works it's a wonderful idea... can anyone comment of if the pet will get the agro, or if the mob will target the master?<P>There's pet agro issues being patched this coming Aug 14th too... the whole thing with Kael giants being nerfed.  I've a feeling that RIGHT NOW, a pet could take the HT... but maybe not after the 14th.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>This "send the pet in to eat the harm touch" worked for me many many months ago when the Warren's named mobs first came out and pets had *normal* aggro on them.<P>AS it stands now with pets taking more aggro than ever, it should. But you're right about the patch. I bet Verant screws it up YET again and the pets will now either a) never aggro anything b) take even more aggro!<P>Heh<BR><P>------------------<BR>_________________<BR>Adon Borealis <BR>War Priest of Tunare<BR>Officer of Legends Of Marr<BR>Zebuxurok</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006783&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006783&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
