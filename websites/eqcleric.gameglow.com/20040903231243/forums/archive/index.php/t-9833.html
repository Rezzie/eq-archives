You want as much health and wealth as possible. You don't want life to be challenging, for most people it's challenging enough already.<br />
<br />
In a game you want to be challenged. If the game is not challenging, it's boring.<br />
<br />
In EQ, people want to gain levels and equipment and generally become powerful enough that they are &quot;safe&quot;. People go looking for &quot;safe&quot; experience, easy loot, the best equipment possible. Why? To reduce the challenge, die less.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think people get confused and pursue real life goals in a game. The social atmosphere of a MMORPG adds status elements into the mix in a very RL fashion, further confusing the issue.<br />
<br />
Just something to think about...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">04-27-2000, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree totally, simply becuase I see it proven every day.<br />
<br />
Take for instance my way of getting through hell #1 vs. my friend (a druid).  I went around camping the paw (no exp whatsoever), getting the cleric legs (see paw), exploring rathe mountains, paw, working on qeynos faction a bit (you people out there don't know what bad faction is, trying killing treants AND a bard, but only the bard around 30 times, treants, on the other hand....aack...).<br />
<br />
My druid friend went from 25 to 33 on the dwarves on sister island, doing them solo. I couldn't even solo one, can still barely do it.<br />
<br />
The difference? He has no concept of group play whatsoever, and has in essence ruined himself for the later levels.<br />
<br />
We got into an arguement about which was better, a 1 mob pull, or a 3 or 4 with the enchanter mezzing and everyone assisting the puller.  He says 1 mob, I say (along with my 34 shammy friend who pals around with me) 3 or 4 in a good controlled mezzing area is good, minus the usual exceptions (spec's, giants, etc)<br />
<br />
Whats the difference? Tons of teamwork, a better understanding of how to play our roles in game, and the fact that I now know tons more people (and know which ones to stay away from, Illiry, of Rest in Peace comes to mind, dirty ks'r)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I have no problem dying in this game, thats what binding and gating is for, as opposed to in RL, where I would prefer not to die just yet (just 2 more hours of evercrack.....please Death?)<br />
