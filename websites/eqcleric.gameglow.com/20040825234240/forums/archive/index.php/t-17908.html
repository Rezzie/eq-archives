We're looking for a few more players of at least level 62 who know how to play their classes intelligently.  Our guild is perfect for those who have families, jobs, or other responsibilities that take precedence over EQ.  We spend about 12 hours a week doing guild events in which you are expected to attend unless real life constraints prevent it.  Most of us know each other in real life, and we put a big emphasis on that friendship.  We will extend that element of friendship to any who join us.  And please, people who complain a lot, like to talk about other people behind their back, suffer from the affliction known as selfishness, or have difficulty getting along with other people - please do not respond here.  We don't have anyone like that in our guild, and we will not in the future.<br />

Just want to have a good time and get some exp?  Then join DotB.</div></div><hr />
