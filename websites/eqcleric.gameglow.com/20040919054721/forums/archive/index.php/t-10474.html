<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thotam</div><div class="date">11-28-2001, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a place out in TD that contains fallen iksars, this place is usually empty and you have the island all by your self     http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Mob level is between 12 - 16 and i stayed here until my necro dinged 20, slow in the end i admit.<br />
<br />
The fallen iksars are nice undead so for a cleric it is a good place to be, they stand far enough apart to single pull, and trains never happen since you are alone     http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif also there is no easy escape from here since there are no zonelines around.<br />
<br />
To get here take the raft from oasis to ogre island(first and only stop) run across the island heading east you will probably see some spiroc buildings on your right, when close to a mountain (should be on your right)<br />
start swimming east, this will a take a little while but you should see the island after a short while, if it is raining then it can be very hard to spot the island untill you get rather close.<br />
<br />
On this island are also some bandits, i for one never tried fighting them, they help out and are between lvl 16 - 20.<br />
<br />
When you approach the island you will see some ruins, that contains a 2 spawn and i never bothered, going left from the ruins you will have 4 spawn along that shore line, that where the ones i hunted, also when swimming here make shure you spot the skellies before you run up on the shore, they don't have a huge aggro radius but still, they hit rather hard, low 30's max.<br />
<br />
xp is good, loot not that great, from a few coppers to around 5gp, also research material for nec, wiz, enc, meaning runes, words and pages.<br />
<br />
Seems an even con at lvl 16 has around 460hp or close and did hit me for 34   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
* EDIT* Should also point out that they run when low on hp(not like the normal skeletons that fight to they die), so be prepared to swim a bit, also try pulling them down close to the water, if you fight to high up they wander and might aggro the next spawn(not that good)<br />

I have heard from a druid friend who did hunt them ogres and he made good xp around his low 20's<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antocus</div><div class="date">12-10-2001, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the only way to get to this island by swimming? It seems a rather risky way to get there, especially if the island is hard to see? No other raft or boat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thotam</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope no other way, but i noticed now with the new dx8 engine that i could see it soner<br />
than before, the loc of the shore is 5611, neg 1137 by the way.<br />
<br />
Dinged 17 with my wizard last night out there, got around 2pp in cash loot and 1 rune and 2 pages (wiz and enc research)<br />
<br />
Perhaps you can take the boat from Butcherblock (maidens voyage sp?) and jump of it since it passes very close to the island, never tried it though.<br />
<br />
Nothing bad in the water either so swimming is safe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antocus</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL, jump and swim from the Maidens Voyage. Ack.. If I'm going to try it I think I'll try it you way. I have to get my swimming skills up first. I'm currently in East Commonlands. Unfortunately in this area, as opposed to the opposite side of the contintent, I've found precious few areas to practice my swimming, so I suck.<br />
<br />
What about the ship From Freeport to Butcherblock? It stops at an island also. Is that closeby. <br />
<br />
I'm going to give this a shot as soon as I hit 14 and am able to bind myself other places. I'd really hate to die on an island I had to do a swim to in order to retrieve my corspe.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was akin to the Druid Bind and I could bind myself pretty much anywhere. Am I wrong?</div></div><hr />

I thought there was a boat from oasis that goes there.  Unless i was on a different island.  I was on an island with Ogres everywhere.  Am i wrong?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one from Oasis goes to Timerous Deep-technically it is the first step on the &quot;Evil&quot; route to the Overthere in Kunark. So does the one from Butcherblock (to Firona Vie).<br />
<br />
You can't bind in TD no matter what class you are because of the teleportation room-VI thought it was too powerful to give every bind casting class the ability to port to any city they wished.<br />

How does one locate this tp room? And I imagine it's too far down for me to swim to, so that begs the next question. How does one get to it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phalia</div><div class="date">12-17-2001, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go to Oasis, get a SoW and a levitate (or be prepared to work your swimming skill).  Take the raft.  Immediately after zoning, run off the back of the raft, and head to about pos 4000, neg 12,000.  You should see 4 pillars towering out of the water.  These mark the door to the room.  Swim straight down (its not too far I dont think).  Once you are in the room you will not be in water anymore.  I used to know where all the pots took you, and what they looked like, but have not even thought about this in a long time.   JUST BEWARE..I know for sure one takes you into Cabilis..maybe other KOS cities..<br />
<br />
If someone knows what pot takes you where, could you please post?  Or link it, thanks  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thotam</div><div class="date">12-19-2001, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also in the area is a nice dragon, not shure how often it spawns but  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Did spend time on nuking fallens with my wizard, did go there after i dinged 16 and stayed until i dinged 20, at 19 like 50-60% where blue rest light blue.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the high damage of the wiz spells i did okey, my druid has a harder time but he also has better armor, and besides cleric have a nice undead only DD.<br />
<br />
With my wizard i nuked 1, medded nuked the second, medded, nuked the third medded, at that point the first one was back up so i could start over, meaning almost constant killing and no spectre trains or sand giants  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
At lvl 19 alone i looted 5 necro words, 2 runes, and one chanter page(all for lvl 16 research) around 140gp 500+sp 1000+cp not that bad, considering that it is a relatively safe place compared with say oasis.<br />
<br />
Also clerics have summon food/water so you could stay forever, unless you have e better weapon using the summoned hammer can be good here with the bonus to hit undead  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

When I was there with my druid, I never saw the dragon on track. Perhaps it doesn't live long when it spawns? (Isn't it for the Druid Epic?)</div></div><hr />

Yes, its for the druid epic, though most druids do the spawned Fay now. Standard RoK dragon loot table.<br />
