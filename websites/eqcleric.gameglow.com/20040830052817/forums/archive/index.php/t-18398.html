<br />
Precision Strike (formerly Science of War) on the Legends-Stormhammer server, are RECRUITING!<br />
<br />
In order of priority, here are the guild goals. We encourage you to respond to this item with &quot;what about soandso and whatsitcalled?&quot; Challenge our vision and our goals, help us refine them. We will periodically revisit this list to see how we're doing.<br />
<br />
Here are our goals, in S.M.A.R.T. fashion. (A &quot;SMART&quot; goal is specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and time-stamped.<br />
<br />
<br />
    * Recruit an unparalleled team of dedicated and skilled players. We will admit as many as 12 players per month. If we cannot find 12 qualified people within a given month, we will not lower our standards to meet quota.<br />
<br />
    * Win increasingly difficult encounters, from Emperor Crush to PoTime. We will create a &quot;big win list&quot; of mobs that we intend to take down and we will relentlessly go after the mobs on this list.<br />
<br />
    * Continuously refine our strategies and learn from our mistakes. We will conduct event post-mortems and catalogue our successes, failures, and tactics. We will continously improve and strive not to make the same mistake twice. Our goal is to have an official event post mortem for 100% of events and to draw lessons out of each event.<br />
<br />
Who We Want:<br />
<br />
When the Stormhammer server was created, guilds formed before people had even played together. The formation process was superficial and usually based on just two criteria: level and equipment.<br />
<br />
It's still quite typical for guilds to invite people based solely on level and equipment. Many fly-by-night guilds will toss invite boxes at any unguilded toon in the hopes that someone will click &quot;yes.&quot; Obviously, that's not the best way to run a quality operation because levels and equipment can be purchased on the Internet. Having a level 65 toon in full VT gear doesn't prove to us that you know how to play your class. It doesn't prove that you would be an asset to a guild and not a liability. It merely proves that at one point someone (maybe not you!) brought that toon to VT.<br />
<br />
We therefore evaluate candidates much more deeply than most other Everquest guilds. Naturally, because of this we will reject more than we accept. But we believe that the slower growth of such a recruiting strategy will more than pay off as we add players that really know their ****. <br />
<br />
***Timezone***<br />
<br />
The guild is primarily on the Eastern United States timezone, with a fair number of members in central and pacific timezones.<br />
<br />
On average, we raid five nights per week, usually between the hours of 8pm ET and 12am ET with the rest of the non-raid nights dedicated to character development.<br />
<br />
We are currently working on defeating Time, we're in phase 4 and have killed most gods on our first try.    Our requirements for clerics are that they have their epic, and are at least tier 2 PoP flagged.  Clerics are the ONLY class we're recruiting and we're looking for exceptional players.  <br />
