</FONT><HR>I read this and my first reaction is that Verant has caved again to the demands of the druids and shaman for more healing power relative to clerics.  <P>They've just been given a 10% boost to their healing power, and that's just the beginning.<P>We clerics must earn 12 AA points in Healing Adept to get a 10% boost to our healing power.  Druids and shaman only have to complain.  Why didn't we clerics think of that?<P>(Those classes would respond to my post by saying that the original "penalty" -- forgetting of course how versatile and powerful their classes are as a total package -- was wrong in the first place.  Sorry, but no, it was an original feature of the game for class balance purposes, not a penalty.  Shaman and druids are very good soloers and very powerful in many ways, remember?  But no, the druids and shaman do not ever seem to remember this.)<P>So Verant intends to give clerics some versatility as part of their balancing, but no details as yet.  Let's hope it's something on par with giving away 12 free AA points to the druids and shaman.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Alan's reference to making the cleric class more rounded brings up the very core of the problem with giving druids more effective heals:  A druid with a viable raid-level heal is the "uberclass" for exp groups, capable of casting just about all the important spells in the game, and is now an effective healer as well.  (Not to forget, of course, druids have a comparable heal to Divine Light, but that's not the subject, (it's viable raid heals), and the Divine Light casting time vs. hitpoint ratio is usually insufficient for a single healer to keep a caster alive on a raid anyway.  I enjoy the challenge presented by assist healing being "necessary", but I have noticed that druids on raids would rather nuke, vying for the exp and/ or killing shot, rather than healing).<P>If druids are given a healing spell which is anywhere near a complete heal, (and I mean even 2,000 HP healing spell is near enough), there will be very little reason to have a cleric in an exp group -- (shaman are better than clerics in a growing amount of circumstances -- a druid raid-level heal will take another portion of that quickly shrinking pie, especially as tanks get tougher via AA skills and more uber armor entering the game every day).  Clerics have very little to offer a group in terms of killing power and utility spells, so the degree to which VI improves druid heals will exponentially reduce the desireability of clerics for exp situations.  Meaning, the "penalty" for having a cleric in your group, (over another healer), is that your kill time is slowed considerably.  That penalty needs to be considered against the druid's downtime penalty caused by less efficient heals.  But first, take into consideration how quickly VI is raising the mana regen rate.  I don't think it 's possible to control the relative power of a druid raid - level heal here, it's too variable given the super mana regen coming into the game lately.  As a well equipped L60 raiding guild cleric I can pull, heal and fight with a group without medding in a LOT of circumstances (given a half decent tank) -- the tradeoff is I can't SOW, invis, evac, lev, etc., etc.  Sounds like level 23 all over again, where shaman and druids are much preferred over clerics.  Indeed, all you need to do is look at the shaman healing spell "Torpor" in order to see what Verant saw as the balance issues in relation to a super - utility class getting an "almost CH" -- the torpor spell is a heal over time, and the player who has torpor on is snared, and has a lowered attack rating, not to mention the spell is almost as rare as they come in this game, and castable only at level 60.<P>Sub - 60 clerics, start exping as hard as you can.  Verant has screwed up before, (manaless CH, ROFL, my dog could have seen how overpowering that was).  I think it's fair to assume they don't realize the depth of problems they can create here.  As temporary as it was, the recent change to NPC caster "Line - Of - Sight" rules makes we wonder if they really think things out, or just change something for the sake of changing something.  I have no background in games, but it took me exactly zero seconds to see how bad an NPC "line - of - sight" change would be.  Perhaps the game balance crew took a vacation and forgot to return.<P>Indeed, they will "improve" clerics in small degrees, changing our role and mucking things up as they go, but should a druid "almost CH" heal go live before we're (yeesh) "rounded"...<P>Level fast.<P><BR>Jesper<BR>60 cleric<BR>Arch of Chaos<BR>Terris Thule<P><p>[This message has been edited by Jesper (edited 07-15-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Velisaris said:<P>/q **Make XXX class more well-rounded.**<P>Be afraid...be VERY afraid. This is one of 3 phrases that should make any class quake in their armor when their class is being referrenced. /q<P>Indeed.  The changes to nukes were seen as helpful, but that change was useful to soloers -- it really didn't do much for anyone else, including the clerics who throw out an occasional nuke, as the mana/ HP ratio wasn't changed as far as I know. It made absolutely no difference to the way I play.<P>I'm pretty happy with the cleric class as it is, and I hope they don't change our role and/ or add "capabilities" in ridiculous categories in order to call us "balanced".  I don't want to become a half-wizard, I chose a healing class, and I hope they can keep that in mind.<P>As for nerfs, I don't see where they can nerf us much, (count how many different spells you use per day, you'll be surprised.  a raiding cleric can get through a day casting as low as 5 different spells).  As for a nerf to CH, almost all large target encounters depend on CH, it's too ingrained to make changes to it now.  An improvement to druid heals, (a near - CH), can be seen as a nerf to clerics, if that's what you mean.<P>Where I'd like to see changes would be an an upgrade-to or improvement-in Divine Light, as well as something better in terms of AA skills.  I really hope they keep things in perspective before they make big changes, and keep clerics the primary healing class.<P>Jesper<BR>60 cleric<BR>Arch of Chaos<BR>Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Not to be philosophical but what is a rounded Cleric?  I can heal, do some buffs and rez.  I cant melee or nuke or travel or farm.<P>I got into the class knowing it's very focused.

</FONT><HR>Wow, such cynics.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>They've just been given a 10% boost to their healing power, and that's just the beginning.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No one has been given anything yet, unless they play on Test.  Possibly no one will be given anything.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>We clerics must earn 12 AA points in Healing Adept to get a 10% boost to our healing power. Druids and shaman only have to complain.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>You're complaining now.  But instead of complaining to improve your own class, you're complaining in the hope of that someone else will not receive an improvement.  Druid's have a different perspective, which is that cleric complaining has been blocking them from getting any meaningful class upgrades.  It's not so different from your own allegations, and probably has about the same amount of merit.<P>Oh, and clerics will still have a 5% bonus to all direct heals.  True, 5% instead of 15%.  But before one might well have said that druids and shaman got to spend 12aa points and <I>still</I> couldn't catch up to clerics who had yet to spend one AA point.  If the change goes live, a druid or shaman who has spent 12aa points will be better than a cleric who hasn't (at least in terms of bonus...  this ignores the impact of CE and CH, of course), but the cleric still has the opportunity to be better in the end.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Shaman and druids are very good soloers and very powerful in many ways, remember?<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The tired old paradigm of "You can solo, you should pay forever!"  Will you follow up with a suggestion that clerics should be able to solo better, yet compromise nothing?<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>A druid with a viable raid-level heal is the "uberclass" for exp groups, capable of casting just about all the important spells in the game, and is now an effective healer as well.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Ok, excluding heals, which druids spells qualify as "all the important spells in the game"?  Slow, haste, mez, rez?  I consider these to be the most encounter defining non-healing spells in the game, and druids don't get a one of them.  Damage shields, SoW, Snare, Ports?  All very useful, but their application was never as encounter defining as the first four, and has only become less so over time.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>If druids are given a healing spell which is anywhere near a complete heal, (and I mean even 2,000 HP healing spell is near enough), there will be very little reason to have a cleric in an exp group -- (shaman are better than clerics in a growing amount of circumstances -- a druid raid-level heal will take another portion of that quickly shrinking pie, especially as tanks get tougher via AA skills and more uber armor entering the game every day).<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Here I think we're skirting the edge of reality.  While clerics resent druids asking for more, in reality shaman are much more guilty of displacing clerics from experience groups.  The addition of slow, haste, regen, and mana recovery is hard to beat when you're a melee looking for a healing partner, especially since the first two reduce the actual need for healing so dramatically.<P>True, shaman aren't whining and druids are.  That should hardly come as a big surprise, though, because shaman are really in a pretty good situation, and in the end game at least, druids aren't.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Sounds like level 23 all over again, where shaman and druids are much preferred over clerics.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>It's exactly like level 23 all over again, but not because of disparity in healing.  Clerics are enormously ahead in healing capability at level 60.  But melee need less and less healing for experience grind situations.  Still, those situations have no real applicability to raid situations, where druids have thier concern.  On raids, there's still only one real choice for healing, and as everyone's hit points inflate the fixed size heals that non-clerics have (and that clerics are stuck with, excepting CH) become progressively more obsolete.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Level fast.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Good advice no matter what Verant does or claims they will do, wouldn't you say?<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>It would appear that they're removing the healing penalty from other classes, making a cleric only marginally better healers, excluding CH.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I'm not sure I understand.  If someone is choosing a druid for a group, it's because there's low demand for healing.  If they're choosing a shaman, it's because the shaman can create a situation where there's low demand for healing.  Considering the problem is low demand for healing, how is it a problem if clerics gain diversity, and it's at the expense of "only" getting modest improvements in healing.<P>To me it sounds like the store is offering to deliver my groceries instead of me having to go get them, and the price for this is that they're "only" going to give me five or six dollars besides.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Where I'd like to see changes would be an an upgrade-to or improvement-in Divine Light, as well as something better in terms of AA skills.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I have little doubt that there'll be a whole new set of AA skills to earn with PoP.  Gotta keep the experience grinding going to keep the customers busy and the lights turned on.  Whether those AA skills will be any better than the previous batch is anyone's guess.  I have my doubts that we'll see truly new AA skills for anyone as part of caster balancing.  For one thing, I doubt anyone would consider themselves balanced if they only achived it as a consequence of having spent a ton of AA points.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I got into the class knowing it's very focused. Can they remove the clerics HEALING > ALL abilities and still have a cleric?<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Depends on your perspective.  If you define a cleric as superlative in all forms of healing, then no.  I think it was a mistake in the game design, however, to have done that.  It would have been much better to have specialized each of the priest classes in different forms of healing and spread the utility around a bit more evenly than to define one class as "gods of healing" and the others as "mediocre healers with geegaws".  Mostly what's been done is irreversable, though possibly some new and unique heals could be added that would result in "different specialization" for healing classes.  I think we'll have to wait for EQ2 for a good fix, though, if it even comes then.<P>Regarding Sharn's comments, which are a bit long to quote in their entirety, most of the things suggested as "never for clerics" are in fact not encounter altering, they're class diluting.  The items in the "two of three druids and shaman will get" are encounter altering.  If there's one thing that can be said for past upgrades and balancing efforts, it's that Verant has been more willing to dilute classes than to alter encounters.  So I think you mostly have your likelyhoods reversed.<P> - Chronomis<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Chronomis (edited 07-15-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Speaking as a retired cleric turned bard.<P>I can understand clerics wanting to retain their usefulness to groups.  You can't solo well, and you're highly dependent upon groups to gain experience.<P>Now look at it from the perspective of the other 14 classes: a lot of areas in the high-level game become "no cleric, no play".  It wasn't much fun (back when I was a cleric) when every dungeon group in Kunark required an enchanter.  It's not particularly entertaining to be limited to the easiest few camps in a dungeon until a cleric becomes available.<P>Many of you have been around long enough to remember when bards got upgraded mezzes.  Did enchanters become irrelevant?  Did they become less desired in groups?<P>Clerics won't go extinct if druids actually get the ability to function as healers in the post-50 game.  As long as they're the best (even if it's just by a little), they will still be in high demand.<P><P>------------------<BR>Staccato Obligato<BR>Hand of Mana<BR>Virtuoso of the 60th Measure<BR>The Nameless server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I played a druid to 60.<P>I then quit the druid, and played my cleric to 60.<P><BR>I understand both sides.  But i'll tell you this:<P><BR>Druids have it easy up to end game.  they get all the toys, and are leveling machines.  They can make money porting/farming/etc.  There's no waiting for someone to port you.  There's no waiting for what seems like hours looking for a group.  You are a god, pre end game.  End game comes(maybe 1 out of 1000 druids).  They do minimal raid buffs.  They do secondary heals.  They get to nuke.  All still fun.  The can still get groups, or still solo.<P><BR>Clerics.  Clerics have a long road ahead of them from the get go.  Inferior nukes.  Decent buffs.  slightly better heals.  Early game, noone wants a cleric.  why would you?  can't snare, no thorns, no gates, nothing.  Just a buff or 2, a heal, and maybe a nuke if they are twinked and have mana.  Move up to hi 40's/low 50's.  By now a cleric has learned, that getting EXP means making friends, and having regular exp groups.  it's the only way to get exp.  they cant solo.  Waiting for a port to meet up to your friends.  making sure you have gems to buff.  making sure you have enough money to buy those gems.  all part of the pre mid 50's cleric.  Along comes the low to mid 50's cleric.  Still can't solo.  Has either quit the character because just healing and doing nothing else is boring as hell, or has transformed their real life personality into that which is likened to that "magic bird" that drinks the water out of a glass.  heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, buff, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, etc, you get the idea.  No easy road for the cleric.  You make friends, or quit.  You heal, or make a new character.  End game comes, FINALLLLLY someone wants us.  we wasted months or years getting to this level.  and oh my god!!!!! someone wants us over a druid or shaman!!!!!!  well, not for EXP, but still, in raids!  heaven forbid!  so we heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, heal, rez, buff, heal heal heal etc.<P><BR>Where am i going with all of this?<P>Druids got an ez road to end game.  then find out that all of their versatility and power means they give up being quite as desired as some other classes.<P><BR>Clerics bust their ass to end game.  Then find out it's still pretty boring, but hey, someone wants us. And now the druids, with all of their utility power, and solo ability, and ez road to end game, want more of the healing glory too.<P><BR>Unless I'm wrong<BR>------------------------------------<BR>Divine Light(clr) heals for 910<BR>Natures touch(dru) heals for 900<P>CE(clr) heals for 1000<BR>NR(dru) heals for 900<P>Looks to me, druids are right on as far as heals go.

Like sound bites, it's merely eye/ ear candy.  You refute nothing close to what I stated.  I didn't say druids had "all the important spells", please be more accurate.  You're also changing the aspect from where I'm viewing -- I'm referring to the power of what druids refer to as their "raid heal" in an exp situation.  Druids can heal, they choose not to -- just so you know, the heal that clerics use to keep casters alive is very close to the druid version of that heal.  What druids are asking for is something between that spell (Divine Light) and Complete Heal;  clerics don't have a spell in between those two, either.  Also, you're help me make my point in terms of calling some spells "encounter defining", when I never stated that a spell had to be "encounter defining" to be important -- when I refer to important I'm also referring to invis, lev, evac/ ports, see invis, snare, others, (I don't know if you're a druid, but this shows a difference between what you and I see as "important").  Perhaps they're not "necessary", or "encounter defining", but not many other spells are.  I don't know if you have or haven't, but try spending some (more) time in the the shoes of a class that can't cast basic utility spells.  It may expand your definition of spells that matter.  Please remember, I don't bring this up out of any type of class jealousy, I'm happy with my class the way it is -- you're the one who chose to change the meaning of what I wrote, from "important", to "encounter defining".  I only nit-pick when it's necessary.<P>In any event, you are rephrasing my point here.  The point is that putting one of these "encounter defining" spells on a druid, (in the form of a large, raid-viable heal), who has so much already, brings one class very close to the outer edge of the term "balance", (as it relates to the exp aspect of this game), while pushing another class close to triviality in some zones, (already, clerics are not much more than exp sponges in FG, for example).  In fact, so much so that VI has given the "shaman version of a large heal" quite a few disadvantages, in order to keep it from being overpowering, (alas, it remains just that in some zones and situations).<P><BR>I said:<BR>/quote<BR>If druids are given a healing spell which is anywhere near a complete heal,  (and I mean even 2,000 HP healing spell is near enough), there will be very little reason to have a cleric in an exp group -- (shaman are better than clerics in a growing amount of circumstances -- a druid raid-level heal will take another portion of that quickly shrinking pie, especially as tanks get tougher via AA skills and more uber armor entering the game every day).<BR>/quote<P>You replied:<BR>/quote<BR>Here I think we're skirting the edge of reality. <BR>/quote<P>I don't know what you refer to, but if it's the fact that a 2,000 point heal is close to the edge of overpowering, I'll have to state that it is "yes, a druid 2k heal would be overpowering". Keep in mind that there are melee characters soloing in some zones these days, and their downtime ranges from minimal to zero.  Also, take into consideration things that druids can do to shorten a battle which a cleric doesn't or can't.  A druid can shorten/ facilitate battles in much more mana - efficient ways than clerics can.  If you still think we're "skirting the edge of reality", then take a look around FG or Velk's, Sol B is even pretty popular on my server.<P>Another thing to keep in mind is the number of druids on any server -- that pie is getting smaller pretty fast, now, isn't it?  While the ratio of L60 druids compared to population of any server is lower than the number of L25 druids to that population, consider how many characters will be getting this improvement -- just consider what adding a large heal to such a large number of players will be. This is (probably) part of the reason Torpor is such a very rare spell, and useable only at level 60, to boot.  That "quickly shrinking pie" I refer to gets smaller very fast when you throw so many players at it in the time it takes to download a patch.  I don't know the numbers, but it's probably not much of a stretch to state that there are quite possibly more druids left unplayed at 45 - 50 than most other classes, and they'll all be waking up and going after their share of that pie when they get their raid heal.<P>Here are the main points of my posts above: the only way a "druid large heal" can not be overpowering is if it has disadvantages along the lines of Torpor.  I hope VI can keep the role of clerics somewhere along the line of where it is now -- (I chose a class that heals as it's primary job, and I hope they can retain that when they somehow try to balance us against a druid with large heals), though it will take quite a bit, and I don't think they can do it without making some large changes to the cleric spellbook.<P>Please don't make sound bites out of my posts, and selectively quote to discount what I (actually didn't) say.<P><BR>Jesper, TT<P><p>[This message has been edited by Jesper (edited 07-16-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Judgement was actually beefed up a lot.  Before upgrade it did 750 for 325 mana, now it does 925 for 325 mana.

Do you even remember the old Verant Everquest forums, that actually had class specific boards?  You must not because otherwise you would have realized how vocal clerics have always been at fighting for things to improve our class...it's a shame they closed those boards because there were some really great ideas amongst the flames.<P>Clerics *do* ask for things to help our class.  However, the official responses we get are more than disheartening...they're downright angry.  We send emails, we submit ideas to the Developer's Corner...we even corner members of the dev team at fan faires.  The response...with VERY few exceptions...is always "No way in hell will clerics recieve anything new because they're overpowered as it is, now stop asking."<P>When druids get together and ask for something, even going so far as to make up these idiotic petitions, the response from Verant is always the same: "We can't promise anything, but we'll see what we can do."<P>No matter what the druid community asks for, no matter how ludicrous it may sound to us clerics, Verant at least seems to take it seriously and listens to what they have to say.  When the cleric community asks for something, no matter how rational it may be, Verant throws up this huge brick wall with "The Vision" painted in big red letters on it.<P>So maybe on the surface it may seem that we're winers and always complaining to prevent druids from getting something new...but it's all we can do now.  We have to fight to ensure our class does not become obsolete any more than it already is.  We're very rarely needed in exp groups if there's a shaman/enchanter there to slow the mob, and only needed in raids because Verant deemed it necessary to make some mobs only killable if there's a CH rotation going on.<P>We can't heal the wound, but we damn sure as hell can do our best to prevent it from becoming any bigger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The cynic in me says that the reason that Verant takes Druid complaints and petitions so seriously is simply due to the number of subscribers who play Druids as a Main.  Even the Druids felt that this was a major factor in why their Epic was made so much easier way back when Epics were just introduced.<P>I don't think this is as true today, but 2 years ago Druids were the single most popular class in the game.  Kunark and Velious was just packed with them.  Today it has dropped off quite a bit though but I'd really love to see hard numbers (not polls, not "I heard from my brother's dad cousin who is a receptionist at Sony") to see what the breakdown between classes these days is.  Then I'd like to compare it to that same list of 2 years ago.  <P>------------------<BR>Venerable <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6975" TARGET=_blank>Quistil Angelwatch</A><BR>High Priest in the service to the Great Mother Tunare<P>Proud member of <A HREF="http://www.afflictionguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Affliction</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>/sigh.  I guess it's going to turn into druid vs. cleric after all, though I had hoped there might be a bit of rejoicing and less cynicism at the prospect of clerics becoming "more well-rounded".  Clerics need greater diversity, but it seems to me that many clerics feel that everyone should pay out the nose for diversity except clerics.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Jesper:<BR><B>Chronomis,<P>If you're going to quote, please quote all relevant material.

I should have at least attributed so it didn't look like I was commenting on what one person said when in fact I pulled quotes from many messages, and if that's what's bothering you, I apologize.<P>I didn't quote everything in detail because I didn't want to have my post a mile long.  Since I was responding to many, I chose only the most salient points.  I actually agree with a number of things that people have posted here, but I didn't see a big reason to post "/agree" to every small point everyone has made in the thread that I agree with.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B>You refute nothing close to what I stated.  I didn't say druids had "all the important spells", please be more accurate.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I quoted exactly what you said.  You said, "A druid with a viable raid-level heal is the 'uberclass' for exp groups, capable of casting just about all the important spells in the game."  My point was that druids do not, in fact, have <B>just about all the important spells in the game</B>.  I'm sorry if you feel that snare, ports, etc are more important or equal to the other spells I mentioned...  If you had them you would know better.  They're handy to have, but they're simply not as important as your comments suggest.<P>To comment more specifically on the rest of the paragraph that that quote appears in, your statement that groups suffer a penalty for taking a cleric instead of a druid is very onesided.  That's <I>only</I> true if the group needs so little healing that the druid has mana to spare for other purposes (typically nuking).  If the group does need significant healing, and most groups do from the point where cleric healing really takes the forefront (mid-30's) up to the point where melee become "uber", the penalty is the other way around.  By not taking a cleric, the group suffers downtime due to thier healer needing constant med breaks. <P>The notion that a druid raid heal has to have any impact at all in a group situation is largely a product of limited thinking.  A druid raid heal doesn't need to be a jumbo heal.  I have believed for a long time that the way for druid healing to be improved for raids, and I hinted at this in my previous message, is to implement a spell that creates for druids a specialist healing role on raids.  <P>My own suggestion is that that be an 80 point AoE instant heal which is fast casting, low aggro, and has the same mana efficiency as Chloroblast if it happens to hit six people for full.  As an AoE spell, of course, it would be able to hit far more than six, but would only be likely to do so in a raid situation.  Such a heal would be fairly irrelevant in a group, totally irrelevant for soloing or duoing, and quite powerful on any raid involving area of effect damage.  It would create opportunities for multiple druids on a raid, as it fully overlaps.  It would have next to no impact on clerics in any situation, though it would bring to an end the idea that clerics must be better, faster, and cheaper at every form of healing in the game, and to some clerics that evidently would mean the end of the cleric class.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B>You're also changing the aspect from where I'm viewing -- I'm referring to the power of what druids refer to as their "raid heal" in an exp situation.

I consider my rogue to be my main these days.  I also have a mid-level (44) cleric.<P>Indeed you did not directly equate importance to encounter defining.  You did do so indirectly, however, because you were speaking in the context of a group experience hunt, and in such a hunt people are looking primarily for encounter defining capabilities.  In most groups invis, see invis, and lev are frosting, if they're used at all.  They don't determine who the group wants to add.  Most people aren't willing to go deep into zones that aren't "safe", so evac is usually the same sort of frosting.  If they are willing to go into a situation where they feel they need an evac, they're typically taking a cleric along as well, in my experience.  Snare, at least, is critical in a lot of places and a valid reason to choose a druid, assuming that the group doesn't already have a necromancer, shadowknight, bard, ranger, or wizard, and the cleric isn't a cleric of Inny with a clicky item.<P>In most groups, druids do three "important" things:  heal, snare, and nuke.  Typically they do not have the opportunity to nuke unless healing demands are very light as a result of someone else doing most of the healing (a cleric, for example) or the need for healing is very, very low.  Druid buffs are only used if no one else can buff comparably, since nearly everyone with comparable buffs has better than a druid.  Damage shields are frequently used, but I suspect most clerics overrate their value.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><B>Perhaps they're not "necessary", or "encounter defining", but not many other spells are.

I've played a magician, the only caster class to get no root.  I've played a druid, the only caster class to get no True North (yes, it's a joke, even though it's true).

The cleric displacement in this situation is zero.  <P>Where clerics might be displaced by jumbo healing druids is borderline situations where a druid can't quite keep up without med breaks, but would be able to with a more efficient heal.

</FONT><HR>Well we got our port to temple (faithstone, just have make or buy it, and its not cheap).<BR>Will a better druid heal displace us? Perhaps not the one chronomis advocates but its already too late, except for CT I already am unwanted in xp groups. We keep bringing xp groups, because even being wanted on raids, I'm going backwards. I lose xp on raids and I'm unable to gain it back efficiently. Most groups I get in are pity invites, they don't need me. Verant has already stated we'll never get invis, so what exactly is this making us more well rounded that they have in mind? I havent heard a hint of what they have in mind. And from experience I'm not holding my breath, I won't consider giving us snare or something like that (which is the kind of thing I expect)making us well rounded. I sure hope I hit 58 soon, I'm so tired of gating back to the bazaar for c3 which I must have if I hope to solo more than two mobs an hour.<BR>Druids, I hope you do get something that helps you out on raids. /whine off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I don't see why there is all this hostility towards other healing classes.<P>I, for one, am damn happy druids (and shaman) will be having that penalty removed. I'm glad they will be a little better at healing on raids. Sure, the penalty removal is a small step towards working out issues for druids, but at least it's something. (If it goes live, mind you)<P>Do I want to see VI "round out the cleric class" ? Hell no...I really want them to not touch us at all. (Barring AA abilities, of course, but that sentiment could be shared by every class)<P>In the 3 + years I have played my cleric (First toon, and only toon I play to this day), I have never once regretted, mourned, or wished for another classes abilities to be innatly my own.<P>In fact, I can't remember the last time I ever asked anyone for invis, sow, a port. I can do all those things, on my own. Not because of any second account, but because there are items in the game, that allow me to do that.<P>Can't solo, you say? That's crap...there are places to solo as a cleric, and tools to help you do it. (And yes, efficiently)<P>Fret not, I don't see this becoming something that will make clerics "extinct", by any means.<P>Exarch Dyschord Venficur<BR>High Priestess of Innoruuk<BR>Ayonae Ro Server<BR>"http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=195081"<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>yeah faithstones, those tinkered gnomish invis devices, invis pots and sow potions can all replace some of the extra abilities druids & shamans have ... but if your butt naked at your bind point, you can't port off to any town of your chosing or if you are doign a cr you can't use your gnomish thing to invis to your corpse. The spells are soul bound  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Maybe if druid complete heals cost a peri or 2 (or some other 10 to 20pp component see invis pots, damage shields/sow potions) to cast and require you to carry some symbol of faith with you so you can't do when nekked.<P>I have seen druids solo 20 blue mobs in the grey in around 15 / 20 mins.<P>I have seen druids solo for hours in western waste pulling 1.5blues of 59 an hour, and knocking over ice burrowers and dragons solos when they get tired of the riskless easy exp.<P>If they loose the ability to do both of the above, then bring their heals onto par with clerics.<P>But I am biased, I don't exactly love druids.<BR>Maybe the druid hate comes from the fact many druids always expect to be paid for a 300mana port, but never even offer a donation for a 600 mana rez ?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I do not think the 10% penalty being removed will break the cleric class (in some cases it is only a factor of maybe 50 hp healed, and that doesn't break the monopoly clerics have on high end hunts).<P>I am not at all saying druids need CH or a 2k heal. Maybe verant could make it so druids are the masters of regeneration (though I think shamans already have that role, they already have the best slows/debuffs in the game) and give druids a group regen that takes maybe a minute to heal everyone and heals for 1500? That would at least help druids heal caster groups in AE encounters, where casters are expected to stand out of LoS anyway.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>[q]If the change goes live, a druid or shaman who has spent 12aa points will be better than a cleric who hasn't [/q]<P>I do believe you hit the nail on the head with that statement.  That's the FEAR that clerics have.  We don't want to be sent off to camp in a dark corner (ONLY if you have an epic, mind you!!!!!) until a wipe occurs, because druids and shamans can heal better or just as well as us, and do everything ELSE they can do, TOO.<P>That's the FEAR.  But personally, I think it's an irrational one.  It is, however, understandable that some feel that way.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Jesper:<BR><B>If druids are given a healing spell which is anywhere near a complete heal, (and I mean even 2,000 HP healing spell is near enough), there will be very little reason to have a cleric in an exp group -- (shaman are better than clerics in a growing amount of circumstances -- a druid raid-level heal will take another portion of that quickly shrinking pie, especially as tanks get tougher via AA skills and more uber armor entering the game every day). </B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Who's doing the displacing here?  Druids with their inferior heals or melees who rarely need to be healed?  I truly sympathize with Clerics who have trouble finding xp groupings and see one of their defining roles gradually declining in the everyday world of xp grinding.  Welcome to the Druid World, heh.  Our DPS is laughable compared to melee in most situations (didn't used to be) and unlike CH, our heals cannot scale to keep up with uberHP tanks.  <P>But my question remains....Why is the "pie shrinking?"  Is it really because Druids are completely overpowered?  Or is it because the game is broken for BOTH CLASSES on a much deeper level?  That's one of the reasons why Druids have been clamouring for caster balancing for some time now.  It's too bad that it's evolved (in part) into Druids vs. Clerics fighting for table scraps because we have so little hope of being brought back in line with melee power.  <P>/shrug<P>Primero Aventurero<P>*Edited to fix quote tag<BR>[This message has been edited by accretion (edited 07-18-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by accretion (edited 07-18-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008906&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008906&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
