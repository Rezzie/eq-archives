We did great on solo's or pairs, but the ADD's and AGRO's were too much between the Burnai's, Gobbies and Giants.  We got killed 3 times and decided to head back to LOIO and regain the exp.<br />
<br />
We hunted Sarnaks and Goblins (dark blues only) and regained all of our lost exp in about 45 min. at the Gobbie tower and Sarnak fort.  By the way, was offered 100pp for a revive on the right plat, made the entire evening worth it.<br />

I find a rogue/druid/warrior/monkey of 28-32ish level and partner at the skelly ruins nearby.  With two of us, I am making about 1 blue every 7 kills.  Whenever we get low on mana or health, we head back to the mill and med up, pass out some buffs/heals to the newbies, spread some BB Stout &amp; go back for more.  The exp is good and fairly safe, I have done this for about 3 yellows now and haven't died yet.</div></div><hr />
