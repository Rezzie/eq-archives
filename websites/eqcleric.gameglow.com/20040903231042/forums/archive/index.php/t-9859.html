<br />
I am Amichius Mirumoto murdered Level 55 Cleric from the former Test Server.  I say former because what made that place my homw no longer exists because of a personal vendetta between two employess of Verant....Khelbin the only GM who ever made himself available to the population at large and Jeff Butler the head of the Live team.  Jeff Butler chose to pwipe/iwipe test server without the knowledge of the man in charge of this type of action who had no knowledge the wipe happened until after it had been ordered and done.  I started my EQ career June 12th 1999 and I have never played on any server other than test because it seemed to embody what I wanted when I began this game so many months ago.  Yes I wanted to test things...yes I wanted to see new things as they emerged.... and yes I hoped in whatever small way I could to help this game be better in the long run just because of my involvement.  I chose the cleric as my class because it fit my personality of helping others to a tee and it gave me a real feeling of accomplishment when I could save my group or buff a newbie or know that because of my healing whatever group of people I was with had been able to accomplish an impressive fete because of my skill in healing and knowledge of my class.  For the record I achieved 50 in November with 47 days played completely legit and when I was murdered had over 87 days played as my avatar Amichius.  I have chosen to leave Norrath because I can not in good conscience continue to support a company who could let this happen.  For those of you who will flame me saying that I knew the risk and I have no room to bitch, I did know the risk that GAME problems could make me lose my items and even my character but this happened because of a vendetta not a game problem and IMO that makes this not part of the risk I agreed to when I signed on everyday.  For those of you who do care you really need to decide if you are willing to finance a company who would let this happen.  I for one will never give them another penny and I hope I get a chance to in person inflict the type of pain on Jeff Butler that he has inflicted on myself and my test server family.  I now leave this gaming community in a state of mourning and beseach you all to make everyday count because Verant has now proven that everyday could be your last.<br />

<br />
And while you are justifiably angry, you might want to reconsider the following statement-<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I get a chance to in person inflict the type of pain on Jeff Butler that he has inflicted on myself and my test server family&quot;<br />

This person stole my online family because he couldnt solve his problems like an adult so he deserves to be treated like the slime he is.  If you do not understand the type of family you can build after a year with the same people then you cannot understand my pain.  You also must remember that until December the peak time population of test was around 300 and before race war was closer to 100.  So the people on my server were not just faces I didnt know but people who I spent all my extra time with and who became in a way a family.  This is what this slime has stolen from us all and he should made to pay.  And yes I will state it again I hope and pray I one day get a chance to meet this slime face to face and make sure he knows what he has done.  My days as a cleric are done....now comes the days as the hot tempered, angry, and vindictive RL person who wants sweet revenge for crimes committed against him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amichius Mirumoto</div><div class="date">06-23-2000, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now for the part about switching servers or starting again acquiring items....do you understand the amount of time it will take to get even close to what I had.  Not only is my equipment gone but so is that of every player on the test server which leads to mindless camps for items which I had gotten months ago or it means switching to the new split server that will be filled with people from 2 of the oldest, thus best equipped servers in all of Norrath, and fighting those 1200 or so people for items under the play nice rules which will mean I will not he able to acquire the items necessary for me to be useful to my group.  So I choose to remain what I belive I am - Murdered - my family and life stolen from me by a slimy bastard.  So I will quit and go on to another game or another pasttime and hope that others will never have to recieve this type of treatment again.<br />

<br />
Was the Test Wipe Jeff Butler's Attack on the Test GM?<br />
<br />
In a word, no. <br />
<br />
The wipe on the test server was completed for exactly the reasons announced, that being the desire to restore the Test server's status as a viable test platform.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where this business about some internal soap-opera came from, but Jeff and Tyler are good friends. And just a note, Tyler isn't the &quot;Test Server GM&quot; as the folks say. He's one of the guys that keeps the EQ servers going.<br />

It is clear your overinvolvement in this game has produced a mental health crisis. Leaving for good might help you to restore some perspective to your life.<br />
<br />
For God's sake, man, 87 days of play time in one year... how did you find time to eat, sleep, or work?</div></div><hr />

What one does with their time is their own business and a complete stranger has no place in condemning someone for it.<br />

It is obvious he has put alot of time and effort into his character, and is upset at losing what he has worked so hard to achieve.<br />
<br />
Brother Amichius, if you do decide to take the Live Server route let us know which server you get transplanted to. I am sure everyone who posts here will be glad to give you a hand in getting back on your feet again. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">06-24-2000, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just curious, but where did people get the idea that Verant would never wipe test? In UO test was wiped often, a reason I never played there. I figured since it was a test server, the same would happen here. A reason I never played on test. Verant will not wipe a regular server, they would lose too much. Verants problem is that they require a test site, but the time it takes to get to a viable testing level for many of the zones takes quite a while. In a test the addition of different items can affect the outcome of the test. This is the reason for the item/pwipe. <br />
I can see why you would be upset, but if you wanted to be assured of keeping your character and your items you should have chosen a regular server. I highly doubt the itemwipe was from a personal vendetta.<br />
If you feel you must have your items to be necessary to your group, and that you will have to compete with others camping them, I cant really help you because nothing I say will change your mind.<br />
And Bipplin was right, that was kinda rude to criticize him. What he does with his free time is his choice. <br />
Since you feel you have been murdered by this action, can you think up a better way to remove items that ARE unbalancing to a test environment?<br />

<br />
Remove every single naggy loot item in the game with the exception of the backpack (as that could cause lack of space issues).<br />
<br />
It will affect an insiginificant proportion of the population (who got items legit I mean).  Likewise it is a better situation than what a full pw will do.</div></div><hr />
