<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emmhim</div><div class="date">01-17-2002, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a kid (11 months), so my playing time is dictated by his willingness to sleep (and stay sleeping). For that reason I often find that it is not worth getting a group, as I usually have to camp before the group is even ready to start killing stuff.<br />
<br />
Instead I usually duo with myself. Have lvl 58 cleric and lvl 54 warrior on my two accounts. The last couple of months I have stayed in or close to BW, as I can always go to the Giant Fort if I can not get a group in Chardok. But the Giants are partly starting to become green, and partly often over camped.<br />
Where can I go where this duo can have some fun and get some exp. Loot is less important.<br />
I tried Chardok, but the places where my duo can work is almost always occupied by a shaman, necro or other soloer.<br />
<br />
Any good suggestions? Luclin is not an option, as one of my two PC's is not strong enough to handle the new zones on Luclin, but anywhere in the old world, Kunark or Velious should be OK.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if it is close to places where other people are, as this makes it easier to get a group when I have the time + I like to stop duoing and run to give somebody a res. But this is not a requirement - just nice.<br />

But on to the topic:<br />
Have you tried Velk spiders? They are blue all the way to 60.<br />
Also SolB spiders (LDC) are still blue to me at 58.</div></div><hr />
