In Katta Castellum there is a graveyard.  Walking across graves will spawn a level 30ish undead.  The spawn points are random throughout the graveyard.  Now, I soloed at 40 here, prob can do sooner than that.  Add a partner and you will be able to pull all you want (and prob have much more fun). <br />
<br />
Give yourself (or the puller) Invis to Undead, run across graves until you get a pop.  Now bring it back to a safe spot by the graveyard entrance w/o stepping on any graves that will spawn another undeadee.  With ItU on this is easy and the mob is just waitng for you to vanquish it.  Now, if by chance you spawn more than one and cannot handle two, np, just wait a minute or so and they will de-pop.  Once they do, ItU again and try again.<br />
<br />
The great thing here you can use all those undead spells you have, pull out your undead DD, your DoT and your panic the dead. What I did was started w/ root, then DoT, DD, then Panic.  Panic is great if you can keep them in the graveyard (any damage, spell or melee, causes them to run opposite the direction they were running), a bit annoying if they make it outta the graveyard and run through Katta.  None of the townsfolk will help you or the undead.  If things go bad, one root or panic should give you enough slack to make it to the Tenebrous zoneline, as they undead are kinda slow.<br />
<br />
Single undead spawns at will, vendors and a bank all in one zone, gotta love it.  Also, the undead drop skins for a quest for a piercing weapon w/ a unique graphic and I believe vampire bane damage, though the next step requires killing a CH'ing cleric in Tenebrous, definitely a group needed for that kill.<br />
<br />
Not the best exp or loot in EQ but a nice quiet little spot to grind at your leisure.<br />
