Most of the guides I've read say to solo the single spec in ferrott but they also say that you MUST have jboots or sow (I was one of the lucky few who DIDN'T get jboots, a manastone, OR rubi chest).  The big problem I have is that whenever I go to lguk or oasis to get in a group for exp I'm always grouped with 45ish people (or higher).<br />
<br />
So is there any specific place where mostly 40ish people hang out and is good exp to get out of 40?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

At L40+, most people hunt in deep Guk, but if you keep to the tower it should be pretty good exp.  <br />
<br />
I still believe solo'ing spectres to be a difficult task at L40 due to the need for JBoots/SoW. And the downtime to take a spectre down at that level is horrendous. You are still better off finding a good group.<br />

Find yourself a really good tank (preferrably somebody at least your level or above) and go to either Oggok and do the 2 ogre guards outside the city, or go to Ocean of Tears and do the seafury cyclops.  Either one of them will be good xp.  The loot on the ogre bouncers is better and the zone line is closer (about 20 feet away to the safety of the inside city (no bouncers near the zone line) but the spawn is slower than the sea furies.  The sea furies generally have about 10-15 cyclopses on the island most of the time.</div></div><hr />

From 35 - 40, do kobolds in Sol B.  From 40 - 45 do bats and bugs in Sol B and from 45+ solo Spectres in Ferroot.<br />
<br />
That is what I am doing and will be doing in the future (level 41 Cleric here).</div></div><hr />
