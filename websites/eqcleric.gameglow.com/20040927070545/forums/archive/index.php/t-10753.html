<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jerycho</div><div class="date">12-04-2001, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I made 45 about 10 minutes before the shutdown for SoL. When I get back on tonight, I imagine most everyone 40+ will be off exploring, so I doubt I'll be able to find many xp groups for a bit. <br />
<br />
However, I still have a goal of going with my guild on a hate raid in a weeks time. So I decent solo xps!<br />
<br />
More than that, though, I need some cash. Symbol costs are covered by the guild, but I have next to no resist gear. I need a couple of kp to buy some resist gear in that week as well.<br />
<br />
So where do I go? What do I kill? Is it impossible to make both these goals? <br />
<br />
I'll have probably no more than 3 or 4 hours of play time on weeknights and maybe 8 hours on Saturday (though likely non-consecutive hours). <br />
<br />
Can it be done? Any tips would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I was you, I would solo either spectres in the south-west corner of Feerroot or Cyndreela (spelling probably not correct) in Feerroot by the Fear gate.<br />
<br />
About 1/4 of the spectres drops scythes which sells for around 12 pp and another 1/4 of them drop bronze scythes which sells for 2-3 pp. You can sell them in the same zone to the barkeeper close to Oggok. I made 1600 pp there while I soloed through hell 45. Took me 17 hours to get that level from spectres alone.<br />
<br />
I do not know what Cyndreela drops, but I have heard she drops pretty stones (emeralds, rubys, etc.) once in a while. These stones sells at 50 to 100 pp.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

Either the solo one in Feerott, or try to be adventurous and pull from the cave. There is also 4 in OOT and Oasis.</div></div><hr />

For massive xp, my normal group is Monk, Shammy and me.  It rocks.  You can take this monk team anywhere.  I like Dreadlands (sigh) and CoM.<br />
<br />
For soloing, Cyndreela in Feerott seems to be good xp.</div></div><hr />
