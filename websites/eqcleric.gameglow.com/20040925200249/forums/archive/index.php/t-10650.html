<br />
I absolutly flied through these lvls. I was getting a level per night (non hell) with my regular group. <br />
<br />
Where:  Overthere, park it in a nice spot to the left (with back to FM zone) of the 'ledge'. <br />
<br />
Who:  You group consists of ONLY 3 people. That is the importnant part, just 3. Yourself and two tanks. I know it's tempting to add a druid, but just use SoW potions. We were killing them too fast to have to worry about them running much. Now the two tanks i used were 2 warriors about 2 lvls above me, dont get much higher, as they will suck up more xp. These 2 really took the damage well, and get hit for alot less since thier AC is wonderful.<br />
<br />
What: Anything, pull anything that moves, Unless it's a goon of course. then haul it to zone.<br />
<br />
There you have it. The formula to speed through your mid to upper 30's<br />
<br />
in the upper 30's move to the SF zoneline, we found higher lvl mobs there, but more of a chance for goon aggro's<br />
