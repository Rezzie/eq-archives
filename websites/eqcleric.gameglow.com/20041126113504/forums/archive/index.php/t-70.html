<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glorum</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, having a blast with my new spells at 24.  I was roaming around the Rathe Mountains, looking for the elusive blue Giant Skeletons, when I met up with a 29th level Shadow Night that I had grouped with before, picked up a 27th level Druid and headed over to the undead ring, since the cyclops hunters were decimating all the skeletons in sight.  <br />
<br />
We settled down to clearing the endless hords of low level undead trash, getting the occaisional giant skellie, monk and barbed.  I was beginning to despair, because Big Red was not spawning even though we were keeping the middle spawn site open at all times.  Finally, he did spawn, but so did two other giant skellies at the same time.  We knew that this could get tough if there was a bad pull.  I sat down after to med up after renewing buffs and gaving out symbols, wiping me down to 40% mana.<br />
<br />
Just then, the Shadow Night said &quot;let me try charming one.&quot;  Before I could scream no, he started casting, and you can guess the results.  As all three of the giant skellies were pounding on him, I managed to spook Big Red, and we made fast feet for the Feerott zone.  At the line, I was able to spook one of the remaining giant skeletons and we dispatched the one who followed us all the way.  The fear failed for the regular skeleton before Big Red's failed, and we were able to take it out as well.  Thing is, we are now all oom and half health, while Red was not even scatched, and here is where the real fun began.  The druid got a snare on him and the Shadow Night ran him in circles while I was frantically medding for that next greater heal.  The drill became I would greater heal the tank, he would melee for a few seconds and the druid would DoT and refresh snare.  After several minutes of this, the tank was getting to a bubble of health and then the fizzles set in on my heals.  He managed to zone, leaving Red with 20% health and me and the Druid.  The Druid took up the kiting, and I then went into nuke mode.  Amazingly, my DD's were not being resisted, even though Red conned at 30th level, and I was able to get it down to where the Shadow Night could come back in and deal the killing blow.<br />
<br />
In the end, we were all oom and at or below 1 bubble of health each from the 10 minute or so fight, and I had my ingot (or is it icon) of the Sacrement.  One of the best times I have had yet.<br />

<br />
Good luck trying to get the other half, tho. It spawns in plain sight (&quot;Hey what's that doll? Icon of the Sacrament? What's that for? Oh well.&quot; *destroy* &quot;Hello. What's that? You need an item that spawns in here? I just destroyed one...&quot;) in a room of agro stuff that sees invis. I got mine with wolfform but that's been nerfed so I'd take a group to clear the room.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps...<br />

<br />
The door will close behind you if you enter the cell, but you can pick up the icon without actually entering the cell.  Stand as close as you can to the threshold but don't go in, and you should be able to reach it.  Looks like a purple doll on the floor.<br />
<br />
Once you've got it, just gate out.  Easy peasy =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked up the icon at around level 32.  I'd gotten a camo from a friendly passing druid, which got me into the room OK, and the icon was there.  This wasn't my first attempt; on the previous day, I had tried with invisibility from a magician, but the icon wasn't there then.<br />
<br />
Now, something in there most certainly sees through invisibility, both druid camo and mage invisibility.  I know this from experience.<br />
<br />
The hunched-over looking female mobs (will sappers, will pillagers...) are undead, and I believe they're random spawns in that room, along with the live mobs.  This would explain why some people have no problems with things seeing invis, and some people get caught.  It's pot luck whether there happen to be any undead mobs up at the time.<br />
<br />
In any case, I was attacked (which caused my camo to drop), but I had time to pick up the icon, and I succeeded in gating out through several mobs attacking me.<br />

<br />
Are you sure about that?  I'm really just curious at this point, not wanting to start an argument  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  I thought there was one and only one (non-pet) undead mob in Mistmoore: the undead knight.<br />
<br />
I know that Maid Issis spawns in live and vampire form, but the vampire form is not susceptible to undead spells, and she has the hunched over look.<br />
<br />
Either the negotiator or the dark elf noble (I'm not sure which) can see invis and can cast see invis on other mobs, but usually that's only over in the castle area.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I just got lucky, but my advice to those seeking that icon would be to nab a camo or invis, go straight to the room with the four doors without taking *any* detours (figure out the way ahead of time using a good map, plenty around), pick up the icon and then put your back to a corner and cast gate.<br />
<br />
OR, if you are of appropriate level, get a group together and fight the stuff there.  I haven't fought much in that area, but there are plenty of spawns so it would be good experience in mid- to high-twenties or low thirties, yes?<br />

You will like the reward of this weapon!<br />
