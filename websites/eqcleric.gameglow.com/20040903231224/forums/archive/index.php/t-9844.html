<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanse</div><div class="date">05-06-2000, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I refer this topic to all those out there who ONLY play a cleric and have NO TWINKS and no other character or atleast played their cleric from the start without any other characters.<br />
<br />
Do any clerics out there find it insulting when you run into other clerics who are rude and incompetent with their jobs, but have AMAZING equipment that they WHINE saying that they've &quot;worked&quot; for it?  (Yes, and with their friends lvl 50 druid/necro of course...that's REAL work?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif )<br />
<br />
But here is the real problem I'm encountering in Kunark. I am a Vicar and I ONLY have ONE character, and that's my cleric. <br />
<br />
But when around places, nowadays...everyone does &quot;need before greed&quot;, but everyone claims their &quot;twinks&quot; need it!  C'mon! I don't want to be rolling against a 50 necro/enc/druid just because they have a lvl 46 cleric they TWINKED!! <br />
<br />
I play my cleric full-time and work very hard. Sure, the planes armor was a nice pay-off, but sometimes after all that work US clerics deserve it?<br />
<br />
Does anyone else run into this problem?<br />

Wanting an item for a twink does not count as &quot;need&quot; and thus they must roll against everyone(assuming no person in the group needs it).<br />

<br />
I've got a good friend in RL who I got addicted to the game and talked him into playing a druid to start because I knew he would enjoy it.  So he started this druid 2 months ago.  He is now level 51, and has a fully twinked bard (fbss, 2 yaks and great armor) at level 23.  I started my first and only toon, Sigfry, about 8 months ago, and just hit 49 the other day.  I don't have golden efreeti boots, reed belt, or really any other really high end items to speak of, and I just got over 200 plat in the bank.  I had to borrow 300 plat from him to pay for my j boots (which I traded a guild member a GCB so he would camp for me), and still owe him about 500 plat.  He asked me to raid my bank account because he only had 3k plat (and items) to pay for his 3rd yak.  It's hard to stay true to my God and not feel angered or jealous, but it is starting to take a toll on me.  I talk to him on the phone IRL and he is always bragging about the damage his fully twinked bard is doing, this and that, and I know I shouldn't feel this way.<br />
     There are days sometimes when I wonder why I didn't start a druid as my first character.  I read the boards fanatically, and even read them before I started playing the game, so I knew how powerful the druids are comparatively to someone as a cleric.  In other words, I knew what I was getting into, so I really don't have any legs to stand on.  I love my cleric, but there have been days that I have almost quit in disgust, but I love my cleric dearly none the less. <br />
      In regards to the Efreeti boots, I have been there once, and only once. I spent 8 hours there, and had 3 boots dropped.  There were only 6 of us who broke it and stayed, and one of them was not rolling because he already had a pair (Miffe, who I hold the UTMOST respect for).  It was very exciting breaking with a small group, as I was the only cleric and I was only 45 at the time.  2 people were there who only wanted the boots for one of them (in other words, they wanted 2 rolls for that one person instead of just one).  So what happens?  Well, 1 drops and goes to a person who needed them (forget who exactly).  2 more drop, and they BOTH go to the 2 people who were rolling for just one person.  Instead of going back into the roll, they keep them both.  One happened to be a druid.  Of course, 10 minutes after he gets them, he is ready to leave.  There are only 2 people left who need them, but since the druid got his and he is leaving, none of the tanks are staying because they don't want to train the whole zone with imps (which I can understand, nothing like being in a room and having a crapload of imps come in and lay waste).  Anyway, I go to the marketplace on Bristlebane.com the next day, and guess what I see? Yup, the druid is auctioning Golden Efreeti boots.  Sigh.    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif  Haven't been since because I am having a hard time pulling people together for it.  Ok, that's my huge rant, and some of it pertains to what you said Lanse, but I guess most of it is just a rambling mess.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Had to get it off my chest though, because it has been brewing down there for about a month.<br />

I do have a lvl 2 warrior, a lvl 3 paladin and a lvl 3 Necro, but none are Twinked. I aminly use them when I will have a small amount of time to play, and can't bother finding a group.<br />
<br />
Of course, my little Lizzie Necro is looking MIGHTY Interesting. I was amazed at how well he is doing, even without a pet.<br />

<br />
This is my sole character (I do have a secondary warrior that logs in when I camp for CR/resses, but he does nothing).<br />
<br />
We have had a multi-guild alliance crumble due to claims of need for twinks. Our guild does not recognize the claims of twinks for need, while one of the other guilds did.<br />
<br />
It is indeed frustrating to run across this behavior, but it seems deeply rooted in some people and unlikely to change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sphynkl</div><div class="date">05-10-2000, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My main char was a warrior who is 45 right now (damn that level).<br />
My cleric is 36 and rising quickly.<br />
He really wasn't twinked to begin with but was given the basic stuff.<br />
<br />
If I get the chance to roll for a warrior item, I will...so I can give it to my warrior who only has an exe axe anyways.<br />
<br />
I just found it too frustrating and boring to play my warrior anymore.  I hated the downtime also.<br />
On soloability, my cleric can beat up stuff that my warrrior, 5 levels higher, couldn't solo.  Less downtime too.<br />
<br />
I feel for the warriors which is why I offer free heals to them when I see them bloodied in the corner...<br />

<br />
Oh, and the case where the expressed purpose of the raid was to equip the other character in the first place. :-)</div></div><hr />

I've got to Admit, I'm Slow, I'm more of an after thought when something Goes bad.  I rarely get into Groups (getting better), and Can't Camp much alone.  I've learned more about the game dynamics then a lot of people, I have learned a lot about Mobs and NPC's. I have learned many excelent Grouping and Solo (and Solo Group assist) tactics.  But Rarely will I even try Camp something with others for Twinks.  I had one Friend ask me over to help him, I ran there, I helped Camp, I then found out it was for his Twink Necro.  Mostly I do not care if he's in Deep Griffin Doo, I'll res him, but thats about it.  Don't like gettin jerked around.  Hurm.. Got off Topic a bit, Oh well. Shoot me a Stun, I'll be good.<br />

Good point, Tyron. That's basically another issue that's related to twinks that bothersome=)<br />
<br />
Wow...didn't think anyone would reply to this topic..Heh. Figured everyone would think I was a weird cleric  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif <br />
<br />
(Just a quick note: I was insulted and threatened to f-off and that I was &quot;piece of **** cleric&quot; over and over. These were not newbies, but rather two lvl 51's. Why? Because THEY missed the res box after I ask them if they were ready and they said yes, but they decided to talk even after that=( You figure they know how to be res'd, by now...and they BLAME me for the xp loss!!)<br />
<br />
Repulsive. Sorry I got off topic, but what I wanted to tell everyone was---&gt;<br />
<br />
I think that us clerics have to band together and form atleast a union of clerics=) We've all had this abuse and for some of us, it's TOO MUCH. (Players abuse us. Verant abuses us. Heck...Kunark mobs abuse us)<br />
<br />
This isn't a whine, but rather incentive for other clerics to perhaps atleast know that we ALL have to make a stand. Grr! Verant listens to the customers? Well, Verant will definitely rethink once all the clerics form an organized proposal, atleast. Well, it could be a try.=)<br />

I started a necro when I was in my high teens.  I have since stopped playing the necro completely at level 7.  I've scrapped about everything off the necro in plans of someday deleting him if I need a slot for another character.  I currently only have him and my cleric though, so that won't be soon.<br />
<br />
I still prefer playing the cleric, and I don't think I'll play another class.  I'll probably just quit when I burnout.<br />

I'd never seen this cleric's name pop up before, but then again he might have been running /role or /anon for quite a while. Don't remember his name, so you don't have to believe me. But I know, and my friends know (since I had them do a /who too) that he exists.<br />

<br />
It's refreshing to know atleast some of the clerics have reached 60th. Although the person may have no social life that needs tending to, or perhaps they share accounts, it's still a good thing to know that it took DEDICATION to get there..and that was definitely a person who really committed to the cleric class.<br />
<br />
It's great to here of more people solely committed to life as a cleric, rather than just playing one as &quot;a twink/secondary/etc&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">05-23-2000, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a twink.  And I'm a 51st level vicar who is my primary character.<br />
<br />
The twink was at first for nostalgia purposes (I moved from Rallos and left my poor bard behind).<br />
<br />
She doesn't have supreme equipment.  But then again, my group doesn't have a bard we normally group with.  So yeah, she does have some stuff that's well past her level.<br />
<br />
But I would never EVER take something for a twink, or to sell, if someone in my group needed it/could use it/wanted it.<br />
<br />
We also don't group with SKs much.  Or monks.  And that's a shame, but it happens.  Not everyone groups with clerics either.  Or enchanters (no one knows why  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ).</div></div><hr />
