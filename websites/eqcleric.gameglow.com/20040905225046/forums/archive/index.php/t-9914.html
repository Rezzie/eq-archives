<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padane Fain</div><div class="date">11-25-2000, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK all this is a very serious post...all joking aside.<br />
<br />
Lately there has been a rash of atrocious Guide/GM/ verant customer service actions that border on the line of corruption.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure every single person and their mother has heard about what the guide did recently, TPing people to Veeshans and all.<br />
Well believe it or nott (have to be blind and deaf not to) there are many many more things going on.<br />
<br />
Recently I was going to Kunark so I got on a shuttle in Butcherblock and when I zoned I ended up in the water...could've sworn on the bible, koran...any holy scripture that I was on that ship before I zoned...well I did the standard petition of course I was gentile and politely asked if a guide or GM could put me back on the ship...because, after all it wasn't my choice that I fell in the water.  Well I waited patiently while I increasedd my swim skill then I got a tell...&quot;I'm sorry the GM on duty says its your fault so therefore cannot help you.&quot; (imagine my reaction as I spit coffee all over my computer screen and fall over in my chair) Well to end this quickly...I swam for 4 and  a half hours until I finally reached an island...fun yes?  <br />
<br />
Another event, one of my guild mates was hunting in Oasis...a slightly deranged group member binds him right in a spectre spawn area...well can you say chain-death? exactly 15...he had to go to chat just so he could talk to a GM.  And guess what...&quot;We're sorry we can't help you, ask a high lvl person to kill the spec so you can move&quot;...Whats that you say? No punishment for the A-Hole who was a group member and bound him...no help? Well after another 3 deaths and 1 lost level actually 5 bubs...the spec was finally killed. Once again Verant takes their Hermit course of action, being don't get involved.<br />
<br />
A few more bugs? sure.<br />
Hundreds of people...I'm not joking here by the way have fallen to their death because of a certain little bug at the PoD lift in Kelethin.  I'm sure some of you know about the bug.  If you cast a spell while on the lift and it lags a bit...your going down and you better hope you have 500 life otherwise...LOADING PLEASE WAIT...when this happened to me and several guild mates...guess what we were told...&quot;Its not our fault the lag killed you&quot;  now may I add I am a calm person but when this happened a  second time...I didn't even cast, just the lag killed me, I was cursing so loud at my home that my friend thought I'd cut off a limb.  I didn't say anything bad to the guide but...was pisssed.<br />
<br />
Now after all this, I have a point...we're paying for a service right? almost $10 a month in some cases.  Now...with that money they do hire GMs and guides right?  (we can guess, yes)  And when bugs kill you there is nothing you could do to prevent it right?  Well...Then me thinks we deserve just a tad better customer service.  If any other business treated its customers as bad as verant, they'd be gone in a month.  If a restaurant didn't bring you a new meal if you found a roach in yours, wouldn't that be unacceptable? Well what Verant is doing is unacceptable.  We are paying for a service...If we had only had to pay for the game and thats it, I could then understand why they dont do much customer wise, but since were paying a monthly fee we deserve some help time and again. <br />
And anyone whos thinking Guides and GMs are always swamped with tells ...well thats their JOB!! And if the guide is too lazy to help people...thats BS, WE ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS!!!<br />
<br />
THe only reason I stay with this game is because its fun, but I dread the fact that one day I may get a bug death and lose a lvl because I know I won't get help froma  GM...and even if they do help they don't even give full experience back...wow how kind. Anyway I realize I'm ranting and raving here so I'll stop for now and see how all of you respond<br />

<br />
While you can certainly bind yourself in Oasis, I was unaware that others could bind you in that zone.  If you can it is a bug, as Oasis is not to my knowledge a city zone.  I'll have to do a test and report back on this one...<br />
<br />
The other issues I haven't heard of - can anyone else speak to these?  I certainly took an impromptu swim in TD on my first boat ride from Butcherblock, but that one was my own fault - I was gawking like a newbie at the huge ship my shuttle was approaching and forgot to step lively.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">11-26-2000, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too experienced the bug with Maidens Voyage. I ended up in the water next to the ship. Luckily I got the advise of a fellow guildmate to swim to the front of the ship and crawl up on the slope there.<br />
What a strange way to travel to FV.<br />
<br />
Regarding binding in Oasis, that gotta be a bug. Osais is NOT a city zone, hence you can only self-bind there.<br />
Perhaps he forgot to swap bind with gate and ended up there instead of his old bind-spot? Well, I'm just gessing here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padane Fain</div><div class="date">11-26-2000, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not totally sure about what happened with my guildmate.  I wasn't sure whether or not it mattered that he was a caster?  I thought casters could be bound anywhere? ANyways thats the story I was told.  But another note...I saw this story on a message board here actually.  The persons account being suspended due to them getting items from someone else who had stolen them? or bought the account on Ebay? unjust no?  ah well I'm sure there's something else to the story so I won't go to conclusions but I still say the IRS gives better customer Service than verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merridith_UK</div><div class="date">11-27-2000, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, youre not going to like my comments but it helps to know where and when you can expect to be helped and where and when you can't. In short only specific problems with proof will cause a guide to help, situations where a player could abuse the guide system to thier advantage are not helped with.<br />
<br />
Each case in point:<br />
<br />
Bind loop deaths. Indeed even casters cannot be bound by another caster in non city zones, had a group mate accidently cast bind on me in a non city yesterday and you get the 'You cannot seem to develop an affinity with this place, try a city zone' message'. If you get yourself into a bind loop death then the first thing is to get other players to help you. Only in very exceptional and specific circumstances will a guide move a bind point. (What would stop a player from dying several times during normal play then dragging corpses tto one spot and binding in a place where they could claim a bind death loop to get a GM res for each body?)<br />
<br />
Boats, if you fall off one either due to your own fault or lag then is not a guides job to help you get back on it. (What would stop a player jumping off a boat then petitioning to get themselves transported to where they wanted to go?). If you were to die due to a bug with a boat or be unable to zone thats another matter.<br />
<br />
Death due to lag - not a guides problem and how could they proove you did indeed die because of lag (who is to say a player didnt fall and decide to claim lag to get a res?) The only time they can res with lag or LD deaths is when theres been a problem with Verants ISP/Internet Connectivity/Server and a Verant employee tells guides to mass res for linkdeath. <br />
<br />
Im afraid that the 'Hermit course of action, being don't get involved' is exactly what guides are expected, nay ordered, to do. <br />
<br />
They are strictly hands off except in very specific circumstances, Im sorry if you think they should do more, but the short of it is - they are forbidden to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merridith_UK</div><div class="date">11-27-2000, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh and GM ressurections are a full exp restore on that corpse.<br />
<br />
Missing exp may occur when characters are rolled back to previous saves - this isnt a res as such, or when multiple corpses are unavilable to be ressed (rotted or too old)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padane Fain</div><div class="date">11-27-2000, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">THanks for clearing some stuff up meredith.  But I still don't like or appreciate Verants policy of play like a hermit.  We are paying customers after all, and what ever happened to benefit of the doubt.  You know where verant assumes that a bug knocked you off a ship.  No one wants to swim across an ocean...4 and a half hous of wasted time.  In my opinion Verant should've made it easier to travel in the first place other than making wizzies and druids rich by giving them the only TP spells.  SO I propose that if someone falls off a ship whether they meant to or not, they are transported back to the ship, I don't see anything wrong with that, thats' not a rez or anything of the like its just a simple convenience, because if you think about it people are going to petition if they fall anyway so why not give them a hand.  and may I add once again...We are PAYING customers we deserve some help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">11-28-2000, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you were going to Kunark with your cleric, why spend four and a half hours swimming? Gate back and try the boat again...<br />
<br />
I remember when I was a young cleric, taking the boat from BB to Freeport and falling off...not being that experienced at swimming long distances, I thought that I would grow tired and drown when my stamina reached zero. After swimming around a bit I suddenly realized that I could stop, memorize invigor, swim up to the surface to avoid drowning, then stop and cast invigor on myself.<br />
<br />
A minute or two later, I realized that if I could cast invigor, I could also cast gate...doh! :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padane Fain</div><div class="date">11-28-2000, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Wish that was my cleric I fell off with, I would've gated in a second...but alas it was my ranger...boy was that a fun swim...I actually watched a movie while I waited to see land terminator 2 is an excellent flick to watch while swimming btw</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kandolek</div><div class="date">11-29-2000, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another side note: guides are not paid. They are players who volunteer their time to try to help others and are on a very short leash as to what they are actually allowed to do (they can watch things and do minor corrections of very known, provable bugs).<br />
<br />
The $10 a month probably goes toward server maintance and the payroll for not just the gm's but all of the eq live team for new content, bug fixes, etc.  I'm also sure a large portion of that is going to server maintance and isp fees.<br />
<br />
For specific cases you stated:<br />
<br />
Falling into water going to kunark: Don't know. I've never had this happen on any trip on zone. I have missed the boat transfer as mentioned above though and had to ride on the front also...<br />
<br />
Death loop: You can only be bound by another person in a city zone.  A caster can only bind THEMSELF anywhere (except kunark dungeons). It's a bad bad bug if someone else managed to do it in oasis.<br />
<br />
For falling though the lift in kelethin, the only players who have a problem with that are gnomes for the most part. And I do believe it is related to lag and posision updating.  Getting a rez for this is very gm dependent. Most won't help at all if body has been moved.<br />
<br />
As far as customer service goes, Verant has better customer service than any other company I've ever dealt with in person (Try calling Time Warner some time if your cable modem breaks. Good luck.).  It helps a lot to know what is possibly a fixable problem for guides and what isn't since they handle any petition before a gm is called usually.  Personally, I've never had a problem with any of my petitions and the longest I've ever had to wait was about an hour.  It takes longer than that to get into most of my schedualed doctor or dentist appointments.  Concidering EQ is just a game, I think they do extremely well.  Sure they could use improvement in some areas, but that's true of anything.  Most of the time they do ok.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krela</div><div class="date">01-04-2001, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can fully understand verants customer services issues, as Kandolek it helps to try and understand just what guides and can and why they can't do other things. It helps even more to be a guide on another server  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
For my part every experience I've had with a guide has been good, and for general guide issues there response times are generally excellent even for a UK based player. <br />
<br />
*however* trying to get hold of a GM for issues that only GMs can deal with is next to impossible... and that in my opinion is unnaceptable. Since Valdelmar left the nameless GM sport nameless has been GMless, and that has caused a lot of problems.<br />
<br />
We are trying to get a guild started... and not any tin can guild I might add but a guild of a large number of lvl 55+ players. We were verified by a guide last week and still no GM has made an appearance to create the guild. This is just one of many examples.<br />
