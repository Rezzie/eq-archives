I am sorry for writing it, but I had to get it off my chest(plate). Please. If you are a cleric, dont read this. You will only get pissed off. It was selfish of me to post it, and it will prolly be removed soon by Rayne. (as it should)<br />
<br />
<br />
Indentured Servitude...<br />
<br />
Clerics are arguably the most powerfull class in the game.<br />
<br />
That being said,if you started a cleric, and dont enjoy that your powers are to more benefit for others than they are to benefit yourself... <br />
<br />
HEY... CHOOSE ANOTHER CLASS!<br />
<br />
This class is not for most. With the current slap in the face that we got with these new quests,  clerics ALL OVER NORRATH must realize that NOW IS ABOUT TIME to try out another class... A few more of these shafts, and I expect that RAYNE himself will give up on his cleric (Hey Rayne.. Hell level 35 really sucks bad.)<br />
<br />
See what its like CLIENT-SIDE....<br />
<br />
Enjoy yourself, let someone else heal and buff you... get someone else to do it...<br />
<br />
See what its like to be <br />

<br />
I started another class. And man... im laughing.<br />
<br />
Start a DRUID, shaman, paladin, or ranger. Those classes have heals, and much much more (hell, paladins even get a ressurect spell at lvl 49) <br />
<br />
Why choose a cleric????? Verant continues to prove that there is no reason to realistically choose being a cleric. I used to believe that clerics rock... but the real truth of the matter is that we are a NECCESITY, so therefore we rock... sorta. <br />
<br />
Try playing ( man, i REALLY hate to say this ) a druid. You will enjoy that class much more, and will find yourself at level 20 in the time it took your cleric to get to level 10. Needless to say... I hate druids. (exept VJ who is now at level 50, and i am 35, even though i met him at level 24 when i was 22... but he is a nice druid anyway, and he was lucky enough to pick the right [better] class)<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way, if you decide to name your next character &quot;Richard Roundstone&quot; and nickname yourself &quot;SHAFT&quot; then the CLERIC is the class for you...<br />
<br />

QUESTION: &quot;Hey Al, when are we gonna help you with your quests, buddy?&quot;<br />
<br />
ANSWER: &quot;Never. Actually thats not true... You can help me do my quests when ... ahhhh never. My quests suck dude. No sense in wasting your time. Ill try them solo.&quot;<br />

(My response: No.... Im sure it wont. I will pay 500pp for a downgrade of a chestplate.... that is... if i ever get to see this Chestplate of the ConstantCamp anyway!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: This is a RANT. I DO still believe that clerics are a worthy class (ONLY because I spent the past 6 months developing one)...<br />

<br />
If you thought 30 or 35 was long- try 45  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Started an enchanter- all of level 6 now, but I only play her when I don't have a lot of time to get a group and go into the bug/bat area of Sol B.  As soon as I get to level 47, I'll start getting into the PoF groups- that will be a blast!  Most of my loot now goes to &quot;funding&quot; my enchantress on her way to becoming a master jewel-crafter (outfits included).  Only I get level 50 filled, I'm sure I'll play my enchantress more (our guild doesn't have one) as we have several higher level clerics.  I'm still the highest level cleric, though, so I get told to stop playing the nechantress all the time- AND I ENJOY IT! hehe<br />
<br />
I don't read directions too much, as you can see (I did read your post), but then again I think I make a perfect fit for playing a cleric- not most can say that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason I continue to play her and have fun with her is because of good friends. If my friends quit playing, Zalana would get dusty and I'd play my enchantress.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">10-25-1999, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree totally. What is even worse is that I am a Dark Elf Cleric. No quests in Neriak either. I have made two enchanters (now level 7 and 13), a Shaftknight (er shadowknight level 15), a monk (level 10), Ogre retard (er warrior level 10 with the skills of a level 5 fighter because he is so stupid and bad luck i guess), a human wizard (level 8 blind as a bat)... and Vilaraa now level 21 Cleric Dark Elf.<br />
<br />
I love my cleric. I hate the world that my cleric is in. No Dark Elf cleric quests at all (good people have Bullsmasher, Shining Star, Screaming Mace, Observer, etc) and now this Quest Armor which is complete trash. I went to a page an saw the stats on almost all the other class armor. Ours is so bad I am almost ready to twink my equipment over to a new character (paladin maybe?).<br />
<br />
I will not go into details as we all know how bad it sucks. the only hope that you have if you obtained armor is that they can change the stats if enough people complain. perhaps a petition is in order for this?<br />
<br />
If I did not like my guild and the roleplaying aspect of my character, I would not be playing a cleric anymore. but I do love it. PoF will come to me sooner or later. At least Dark Elves can wear that armor now.<br />
<br />
enough rambling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lvl 49 you get res with most exp (the paladin one is like are lame no exp res)<br />
<br />
At lvl 44 you can nuke for 495 (585 undead)<br />
Buff for over 500hp<br />

<br />
No real reason to go on, you must hate being a cleric cause you don't know how to play one.</div></div><hr />

I will admit I have to sit and med a bit more, but I can also tank.  If a cleric wears the AC stuff and not all that wisdom stuff (and get hit a lot so def stays maxed) you can stand there and take a BEATDOWN better than any other caster.  true a few heals will have to be cast and hope to the gods that you don't get interupted as much but its still possible.  I can't WAIT till 44:-)<br />

<br />
A) Thank you Enefen for helping me get my Cadcaus of the Sacrament. I really appreciate your help. (clerics help clerics- gotta love that) Give me a tell and Ill help you go get you your goods from Kithicor.<br />
<br />
B) I went 35 levels using crappy 1h blunts only to now get two awesome weapons in one week! I had just gotten my Cadcaus, when for haloween I got the Tier Dal 2h staff, and the +6 wisdom Decayed Morning star... Wow...<br />
<br />
C) Man, and now I am doing Guk and Kithicor exclusively. What happiness! Please let this Kithicor Undead invasion last forever... We need a middle road Undead area to take some pressure off of Guk. I mean how many 34-38 clerics can you squeeze into the bedroom of Lguk?<br />
<br />
D) I did rant, and I did 'whine'. It was really my first major whine but i think that originally it was justified. Now, it seems that verant has listened to all of our disgruntled voices. . . Thank you verant!<br />
<br />
E) The +6 wisdom morning star is a great melee slot weapon, and the sharkbone hammer would be an IDEAL combination to put in our RANGED slot (yes it does apparently fit there) for a total of +20 wisdom if you use a charred guardian shield. WOOHOO!</div></div><hr />
