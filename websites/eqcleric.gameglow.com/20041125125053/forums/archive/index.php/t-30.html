<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone had any lucking in trading a spirit tomb, especially on older servers?  I got one tonight and as I have a paw and cgs I prefer to use those, and the enchanter with us (only other caster) already had one from an earlier break.<br />
<br />
Personally i think that with a 6wis/int raise it'd be better for enchanters, but I know that between the stein of mogguk and the gbs the tomb is the next best thing.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything about this?<br />

Can anyone share some info on the guy that drops the Tomb?  I know the Undead Librarian in Kaesora (Spelling?) drops it but thats about it, not even sure what level he is or what it would take to get to him.<br />

The Librarian spawns were 35 we think and weren't too hard at all, just keep RM up.<br />

Oh, and forget about using IVU.<br />

<br />
I think maybe i sold it for less than i could have gotten, had i been prepared to try auctioning it longer.<br />
<br />
Still its financed a RMB, cleric bracer plat bars, and a +4 wis head item, with change so far  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Now all I need is a Girdle of the Diligent, Mammoth Cloak, and eboots for the magical 200! (High elf, btw, with a str of 75, what WAS I thinking....)<br />
