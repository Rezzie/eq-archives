<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I Know, I know, been covered many many times before. But I still cant decide, and reading through posts where people range from lvl 1 to lvl 6 talking about their spells doesn't help much.<br />
<br />
The Mandatory ones:<br />
<br />
Superior Heal<br />
Greater Heal<br />
DA<br />
DB<br />
Gate<br />
<br />
That leaves me with 3 slots. Assuming I will be grouping with at least one good tank, Complete heal needs to go in there.<br />
<br />
I Like to be able to enstill something if I get aggroed on, of course this is not needed as much if we have good crowd control.<br />
<br />
I like to chain stun, but If I mem Enstill I only have one slot open.<br />
<br />
What I was thinking was In a tank group where people are higher than me, go with Complete heal, Enstill and utility slot (Buff/nuke/etc) (Resists will likely be high on stuns if I am with a bunch of lvl 48-52 tanks anyway)<br />
<br />
But if I am in an equal/lower level group, use 2 stuns and enstill. <br />
<br />
Does that seem reasonable, or have I lost it?<br />

Myself personally have my spells arranged as follows for most situations from top to bottom.<br />
<br />
1)  Remedy (hot keyed)<br />
2)  DB<br />
3)  Buff (hero)<br />
4)  Utility button - swapped with a AC buff/stun/debuff etc<br />
5)  Stun <br />
6)  Divine Light<br />
7)  Complete Heal<br />
8)  DD - retribution or banish / replaced with DA when doing a break in planes or such.<br />

<br />
a) Root, rather than enstill, is my constant companion.  Faster to cast, low mana, and generally does the trick.  From my experience, it tends to resist less as well.  I also use it on runners when the normal root/snarer is oblivious.<br />
<br />
b)  Save the complete heal til you actually get a tank that can really use it - and *only* if you're never getting anyone else beat on.  For me, that doesn't happen very often so far.  Maybe your luck is better.  Superior is just on the edge of slow for me, and I've had a few panicked wizards while even that finishes on a tank.  (And then greater heal on the wizard.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Illyna</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, though it took me a long time to come around, you dont really need gate in there in all situations. Meddik, I know you've heard this before, but it is quite convenient to just swap it in after a DA if you are going to need to gate. Not always, just sometimes. Give it some more thought (that third stun can really make a difference).<br />
<br />
I can't tell you more than you've already heard before. Atone is always nice outdoors if no chanter cause you never know. EF is probably gonna be needed if you are CHealing.<br />
<br />
So other than saying that Gate is mandatory, no I don't think you've lost it at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veloran</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd recommend losing Gate as well. The only time I have it up is if I'm running without SOW in hostile or unknown territory now.<br />
<br />
Back at 39 I believe my line up was...<br />
<br />
Greater Healing<br />
Superior Healing<br />
Force<br />
Holy Might<br />
Divine Aura<br />
Divine Barrier<br />
Situational #1<br />
Situational #2<br />
(Wrath, Expulse Undead, Invoke Fear, Panic the Dead, Root, Enstill, Cancel Magic, Buffs, Stun, or Complete Heal)<br />
<br />
Cheal I started using just to get the feeling for the timing. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you out Meddik<br />

<br />
Obviuosly entirely dependant upon the place/mobs/party your in.<br />
<br />
Your 'obligatory' list is a bit different than mine..<br />
<br />
Obligatory for me varies too.. either traveling mode or camping mode:<br />
<br />
<br />
Travel Obligatory:<br />
Medim Heal<br />
Nuke or Undead Nuke<br />
Atone<br />
Stun<br />
Fear/Light<br />
Root<br />
Gate<br />
Divine<br />
<br />
Camping Obligatory:<br />
Heal (of whatever type)<br />
Root<br />
Stun<br />
Gate<br />
Divine<br />
<br />
Combat/Camping spell loadout is HIGHLY swappable.. I mean comon you are SITTING medding 90% of the time anyways.. so you see someone pulled a spider swap out your cure poison.. you see someone pull a Burynai Cenobite and hes a small race warrior who refuses to equip a sheild to bash, load up 3 stuns (I find that easier than letting it WRATH the crap out of the warrior or worse yet a caster who burns a tad heavy).<br />
<br />
The reason my obligatory load on combat includes certain spells are that despite circumstance almost always universally usefull:<br />
<br />
Heal: Duh<br />
<br />
Stun: Caster nuking too hard? Stun it let the tanks get a chance to take it. Casting mob? Stun it , no more casting. Mob running away? Stun it.. now hes not.<br />
<br />
Root: Tank pulls 3 mobs.. and says 'EVERYONE ASSIST ME&quot;  .. me thinks .. no spank  you mr tank. I know as soon as I heal the other 2 are gunna come play 'cleric orgy' so I walk over, tap one on the shoulder with my mace a few times.. walk him over the side a bit ROOT.<br />
<br />
Walk back to the other one.. TAP TAP.. c'mere punk.. ROOT.<br />
<br />
Life is now better when the heals start dropping.<br />
<br />
Gate: Duh<br />
<br />
Divine: Duh<br />
<br />
Travel Loadout:<br />
<br />
Fear/Light: this is the *most* usefull travel stuff I have ever used in outdoor zones.. up until I got Invoke Fear with its quick casting time I used blind (flash of light). Just flash him..step away.. and hes off and running..and you head the opposite way. By the time it wears off your usually out of range. Sometimes it goes away quickly though,which is why when you get Invoke Fear go ahead and use that isntead, quick casting time, resists less and they will run a lot longer period most the time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're taking 3 slots up for escape spells, you might as well use your open slot to mem Resuscitate.<br />
<br />
My answer is that you have to choose the spells based upon your role in the group, the place you are fighting, and the situation that you find yourself in.<br />
<br />
Assuming, hypothetically, your role is main healer, the place is lower guk, and the situation is a well balanced party pulling a steady stream of 2-3 blue to yellow mobs, I would suggest something like<br />
<br />
DA<br />
DB<br />
CH<br />
Superheal<br />
Root<br />
Stun<br />
Big undead nuke<br />
Utility<br />
<br />
with utility being the most useful spell at any given time from your spellbook out of all the rest. Combat-wise this can be a stun or secondary nuke, gh, buff, calm, atone, etc. If you ever have to fire invul, swap gate into utility (you want your invul recharging ASAP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corii Se'Lune</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would advise you get rid of Gate. If you get in a situation where you absolutely need to get the heck out of there hit one of your Divines, sit down, forget the spell you just cast and mem Gate. Also at 39 I rarely if ever used Complete Heal just because of the efficiency - I also did't ever really group with a warrior much during those levels.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
My suggestion is:<br />
<br />
Greater Heal<br />
Superior Heal<br />
Divine Barrier<br />
Divine Aura<br />
Root (Enstill is better for parking but at 39 it fizzles and gets resisted too much to be efficient)<br />
Holy Might<br />
Force (maybe depends on fizzle rate) OR Situational<br />
Situational Slot (Buff, Fear, Undead DD etc)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Olanthe Imaandar</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the Nth vote for getting rid of Gate. Back in the late twenties, I was advised by an experienced cleric to lose it. I was skeptical, but did so. Since then (and it's been nearly 20 levels) I have never regretted that decision. The one time I needed gate (when I got trained out of an unfamiliar dungeon and couldn't find the zone), I DA'ed and sat down to mem it. DA is an anti-taunt anyway, so I was able to get the gate off afterward where I couldn't get it before.<br />
<br />
Here's my usual spell lineup:<br />
<br />
2 Divines (only because they can't be swapped out; in a relatively safe situation where I need lots of spells, I sometimes lose DB in favor of another spell)<br />
Greater and Superior heal<br />
At least one stun (the lowest level one), if fighting stunnable creatures<br />
Complete heal (if fighting with heavy tanks mid-40's and higher)<br />
Undead DD, if fighting mostly undead; or, very rarely, general-purpose DD<br />
The rest will be utility spells (root, fear, extinguish fatigue, etc) - or if not used, fill up the slots with stuns. I don't nuke much, but I am a chainstunning maniac.<br />
<br />
My most common setup now is 2 divines, 3 heals, 2 stuns, and a DD. I swap out others as needed.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devrill</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, here's my lineup....<br />
<br />
Buff/Stun(/complete heal when with a fully buffed tank)<br />
Remedy (Greater heal)<br />
Divine Light (Superior heal)<br />
Atone<br />
Enstill<br />
DD (regular or undead)/stun<br />
Stun<br />
Gate<br />
<br />
The line up changes a little on the planes, but this is what I use most of the time - and yes, I never use either of the Divines. If things go bad in a dungeon, I gate to the zone. <br />

<br />
I always had:<br />
1) SHeal  #hotkeyed<br />
2) Gheal  #hotkeyed<br />
7) DB<br />
8) DA<br />
<br />
6) is for either CHeal or Nuke<br />
<br />
Usually:<br />
3)Holy Might<br />
4)Root    #hotkeyed<br />
5)Force<br />
<br />
Word of advice, never, ever hotkey CHeal.  It's a very bad thing to hit it by mistake and be unable to cast for the 10 seconds it's try to go off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">07-02-2000, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At lev 41, I generally toss CH if there isn't a warrior in the group or someone I can't buff to 1500hp or more.  (I travel with monks a lot, who aren't as heavy in the hp department.)<br />
<br />
My xp-farming mode spells look like:<br />
stun (or force if no enchanter in group)<br />
greater heal<br />
superior heal<br />
complete heal (or a second stun)<br />
atone<br />
word of health (if i have a full group)<br />
divine aura<br />
divine barrier<br />
<br />
Almost never deviates except for an undead nuke or counteract poison depending on what we're hunting.<br />
<br />
I'm miserly about my mana, so i like to keep up as many different heals as possible to maximize my impact on the group.</div></div><hr />
