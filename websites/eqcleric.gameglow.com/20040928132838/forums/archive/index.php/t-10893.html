We tried today with Velketor and it took us a few tries, but we did finally get it goign pretty good.  (Until Velktor got to 50% and wiped us out!).<br />
<br />
We ended up with 4 chealing clerics in a group with a bard and necro.  We made macros to time the cheals.<br />
<br />
Is this typical of the technique used?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">07-22-2001, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well not sure how others do it but we set up a tank list.<br />
<br />
First tank on list goes in with defensive, when defensive starts to go down (time it) so will next one go in and so on.<br />
<br />
Either have 3 clerics/tank group (2 cast CH every 5 sec, third chain divine light, space it when you get the feel for it on the main defensive) or list of clerics casting CH every 5 sec (and druids/two clerics tossing in divine light when needed) on the current main tank.<br />
<br />
Rest go in attack back out so they dont get aggro.<br />
<br />
Anyone else then main tank getting aggro dies, simple as that. You get aggro and is not main tank so have you screwed up anyway (=.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">07-22-2001, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Practise that technique. We use it for practically all the high end mobs...<br />
<br />
Like last night, when we for the first time tried warders in Sleeper's Tomb. The first three went down to a force of only 24 (well, we did have 25 on the first one). :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">07-22-2001, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Main tanking technique is the only way I have ever seen some serious high end mobs (Velk, CT) drop. Also works well on other strong mobs like the general in kith forest. Had a raid that tried traditional raid-style attacks on the general and he basically wiped 45 people from the map. 15 people left, and the remaining 30 switched to main tanking and took out 2 generals easily.<br />
<br />
One thing that is crucial with the chain-CH technique is to have someone spamming direct heals, preferably several people (note: important high end healing role for druids!). It keeps tanks alive long enough for that next CH to hit, and if a main tank goes down the time it takes to switch to the next can be very costly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-22-2001, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, we weren't timing disciplines and I'm sure we need to.  Wow, it's nice to see my guild finally trying out some strategies rather than just zergling everything.<br />
<br />
Any others you can share?<br />
<br />
Also, we only had about 5 groups on Velketor and were very low on warriors,  only had two warriors in fact.  Only one was level 60, other was 55.  So I think we did pretty good getting him under 50%!<br />

<br />
In long battles, when disc defensive runs out on the first tank, how do you transfer aggro to the next?<br />

<br />
I'd be interested in hearing your tactic if you wish to share. <br />
<br />
And I also want to hear how to transfer from one tank to another.  That's a tactic we really need to nail.<br />

<br />
Switching tanks mid fight mostly involves proximity. Just make sure the person you want tanking is as close as possible, and everyone else is at max melee range. If necessary, have people turn off attack if they're aggro'd and leave it off for a few seconds.<br />

Was initially brought on by low numbers which made us go oom using primary tanking (used on average 30 for Vindi, sub 40 for Statue, sub 50 for Yeli, ~30 for 350 Dain etc). Still, I'm not gonna spoil it all for you, but just informing that there are options  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iphigenia</div><div class="date">07-26-2001, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would you define main tank aggro as the entire fight centered on one tank?  Or as the fight being passed from warrior to warrior with the defensive discipline used? Seems like the defensive could be very important as it reduces dmg by about a third doesn't it?<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to get my terminology straightened out here!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remfin</div><div class="date">07-30-2001, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either way it's focused on a &quot;main tank&quot;, so it fits either one of those situations</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quilan</div><div class="date">08-30-2001, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ele dear just one short addition here, use the Guild channel on an all guid raid for notice of a Ch casting that way the main tank won't get 3 at the same time.  Not usally on the all cleric group lass, use normal groups so that the cleric can also heal the group and be healed by the druid, VERY important with AE mobs!  Hope this helps some.<br />

If you start a macro with a /pause in it and fizzle the spell, you are locked down from recasting it till the /pause time is up.<br />
<br />
One recommendation I have for setting the agro on a MT is to collect frost giant toes and have a shamen make stacks of potions for them. I forget the name of the potion, but its effectivly a 300 pt self heal. One common thing we do is CE the MT and start a CH on him a few seconds before he engages, he then rips through a few charges of the potion and everyone else engages. By the time the first CH lands and everyone engages, agro is nicely set on the MT.<br />
<br />
Timing of the heals and smothly switching from one tank to the next is something that will take you some practice.<br />
<br />
CT and Dain can't be main tanked like other MOBs due to thier special abilities.  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlia</div><div class="date">08-31-2001, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question about building aggro with the heal potions... If you are at full life, and quaff the potion and it is supposed to heal 300 life, how much aggro do you take?<br />
<br />
I seem to recall some post by Verant when they made the aggro change to CH where they mentioned you only gain aggro for the actual points healed. (Otherwise clerics would be eaten alive since CH can heal upwards of 10K hp)<br />
<br />
Anyone have any insight as to if aggro is based on actual points healed or based on max possible points healed from the spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistleburr</div><div class="date">08-31-2001, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings!<br />
<br />
We use a variety of healing-chain macros. The basic format is like this:<br />
<br />
/ooc CH on %t<br />
/cast 2<br />
/pause 35<br />
/ooc Joebob start CH<br />
<br />
Before a fight we announce the healing order and fast and slow delays (e.g. Heal order Thistle Joebob Jimbob Bettyjo delay 35 slow delay 60). Clerics modify the pause delay and succeeding cleric portion of their hotkeys.<br />
<br />
The fast delay hotkey is used until the mob is slowed (if slowable), then the slow delay hotkey is used to conserve mana.<br />
<br />
If a cleric fizzles, is out of range, or is interrupted they announce that and the next cleric begins their heal early.<br />
<br />
If the main tank does not have aggro then the clerics duck out of the heal at 2 seconds (one casting bubble) remaining.<br />
<br />
We normally have four clerics in the healing chain, with any other clerics attending to their groups, spot healing, or ready to replace a fallen cleric in the heal chain. For some very high damage mobs (like Lord Vyemm) we will use more clerics with a very short delay time.<br />

<br />
It's actually Ice Giant toes from permafrost/everfrost giants.  And they do come in handy, along with getting your MT up to 110 dmg or so dmg shield.  Think one battle our ogre was over 10k in just dmg shield damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">09-01-2001, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have done Lord Bob a few times (my first REAL experience with main tanking).<br />
<br />
At first we got waxed because we didnt time our CH properly.<br />
2nd time was much better, only a few deaths.<br />
DONT heal others than MT (I tried sawing a few rangers, BIG mistake!). If they get aggro, they are doing something wrong and are fubar.<br />
<br />
We were 3 clerics doing the CH routine with 5 secs between heals.<br />
<br />
Be sure to assigh a secondary MT, if the primary MT goes down.<br />
Then the trick is to have all others back off and let the MT engage as the only one.<br />
<br />
We had a ranger and rogue die from riposte alone, so have all other melee attack from behind.</div></div><hr />

Group:<br />
Main tank: Dual wields SoD, uses shaman DS potion prior to fighting. Also has mage DS.<br />
Cleric1: Chain Chs till 40 mana<br />
Cleric2: Tosses in remedies, when cleric 1   reaches 40 mana, cleric 2 begins chain ching<br />
cleric3:Keeps CE on tank, also throws in an occasional remedy<br />
Bard: Uses puretone and plays DS songs<br />
Druid: Chain remedies main tank, heals bard if bard on rampage list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you aren't locked out from recasting it.  You can use ALT-# to cast it or /cast # or probably even the mouse.  You are locked out of using your hotkeys for the duration of the delay.  Besides, I put a fizzle catcher in my macro to do a recast after a short pause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also don't like timers in the heals, mainly due to lag and the fact they lock you in for the duration. Besides, a lot of being a good cleric is instinct and timing, recognizing when to play it safe, when to push the envelope and when to be a good little automaton. Timers are too rigid and inflexible, they lead to laziness and they cause confusion during those encounters when things inevitably go bad. If you're going to use timers, you may as well just calculate how long you're going to go between heals and setup a /cast 1, /pause 170, /cast 1, /pause 170, /cast 1... hotkey.<br />
