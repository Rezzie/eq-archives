Log in. Do a set petition feedback for our cleric woes. Decide these first on this forum and only petition top FIVE. (one of my oldest bitches, umm pet peeves is the useless detect magic spell-I want a minor lore spell here so I can divine what the heck I have and if Brell Likes it or not-can;t trade no drop items to a bard for a lore...so their lore is useless).<br />
 ONCE we have a top ten list- we trim out the redundant and decide on a CUT and PASTABLE Top FIVE Fixes the clerics need to make them Fun, competitive at all levels, and so we can finally say; &quot;Verrant noticed us, and it wasn't a nerf or an accidental common spell fix only.&quot;<br />
 We select alphabetically each server, all go there create a lvl 1 cleric-post our premade petitions/feedback/bug reports . (or use your  character you have on that server already)<br />
 And move on. Monday...bertoxx..<br />
 Tuesday...Brell <br />
 and so on.<br />
 One by one<br />
 Peacefully posting our feedbacks, and petitions on each and every server.<br />
 Until all receive it.<br />
 This will show a progressive and cohesive community using the proper channels to get something positive done for the clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
NEXT we tackle the lack of Clerical Quests in  all clerical temples except teh human ones.<br />
 (Dwarven Clerics have the option of doing a paladin quest for a no drop paladin only sword...oy vey, done it now what?)<br />

  Tis correct Feedbacks are read by verrant staffers, not by dem guide types.<br />
  Oi should a been clearer on dat point, but I still think we need a top ten list of things we need fixed.<br />
  Den we post a feedback on top five server by server, day by day, until someone notices.<br />
 Oi also someone post it on dah EQ board on dat funky board EQ owns.<br />
 Moi-got dem Wizzies whine allot as do dem necros...sheesh dey should try a day in our shoes.<br />
 I will start a thread on dis board bout dah top-10 things we want fixed. mebbe Rayne after he sobers from Brell Mass can aide us in coallating (dat hurt me tougue) dis info into something that fits into a feedback form  in EQ and setup the day by day feedback so that we can really let the Powers-dat-be know we mean biz.<br />
   Now whoever posted that Mithril &amp;lt;Mythical&amp;gt; hammer on dah quest page has got me beard soaking from drool. DIS IS A DWARF'S DREAM BASHER. Smack-em Crack-em, let Brell Sort them mushies out.<br />
