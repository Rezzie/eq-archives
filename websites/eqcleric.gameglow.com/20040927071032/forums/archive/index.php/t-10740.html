How to get past the Spectres, what your experiences have been, etc.  As a 47 Cleric I think I should have no problem with her.<br />

Imagine the hard part is getting rid of the pet the first time. After that, just make sure you pop her up side the head with a stun or retribution before she pulls the little bonebag out of the ground. Just root, smear liberally with divine retribution, repeat as necessary.</div></div><hr />

best way to break camp is to use panic the dead on her pet  refresh as needed   , root and nuke her  MR/PR  is key to her  at 47 she give you a fight but she doable   i camped her from 49 to 55 of and on she becomes green at 55 /rude vi  set up camp to the left fo portal  just down on the edje of it you will be outta her agro range when she pops STUN ASAP follow with root and goto town ..</div></div><hr />
