We finally drive an hour away to a store that carries Kunark. We buy the full installation.  After much trepidation (and actually cause they brought the server down, so what else was I to do??), I load the new full version over the existing version. Load goes well. Start downloading all the patches. They go well. Download the Optional patches. They go well. Start on the Kunark patch- it is late, I go to bed.<br />
<br />
Next morning- download failed.  So- I start the download again. Finish it. Attempt to register Kunark- Invalid account key!!  I try caps on, caps off. Some of the letters are possibly O, some 0, I try different variations!<br />
<br />
BAH!  Now I have to call VI Tech Support!<br />
<br />
*blush* I feel better now.<br />
Thanks for listening.  I am at work, and of course I can't rant to anyone here  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
