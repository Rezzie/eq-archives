<br />
Sometimes I feel like we exist only to enhance others game play at the cost of our evening spent obsessivly staring at health bars.<br />
<br />
Sorry, just feeling pretty crappy after reading many of the posts on the EQ boards about how they want res for more classes because cleircs get too much in the game.<br />
<br />
Damn it would be nice to have those folks appreciate the work that it takes to be a cleric so we can perform amazingly and save the party 25 times a night so that they can ignore us and all tell the warrior &quot;nice crit&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">06-05-2000, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nice if everyone had to spend 13 nights, playing each other class (at a high level, not at level 8 or 10 where it's all still easy).  After playing my wife's bard, I know I'd never enjoy that -- would rather be on my arse than trying to triple-twist songs.  And playing an enchanter?  Feh!  At least we can hot key to heal... they have to try to target that a_nasty_mob when there are two of them with the same name  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I love playing other melee classes, they are so easy... either you target (if you're main tank) or assist, then attack.  Maybe taunt, or kick, or whatever.  Don't have to watch hitpoints, just pay attention when the healer shouts he's under attack  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  And casters?  How fun to throw ice comets to finish off that mob, after the tanks have beaten on it for the last 2 minutes...<br />
<br />
Now as party healer, you're constantly watching health bars, who's getting hit, who's casting, what's casting on you (so you know if you need to stun), if no enchanter you're rooting the extra mobs out of combat, and then trying to heal while you're getting triple attacked for 100 plus each hit.  Then when the combat is over, your party gets upset because you are 40m and they want to pull again!  Walk a mile in my shoes (or spend an hour in my armor) before you judge how easy my class is to play...<br />

So many times have I've been grouped up with a 5 tank types (latest being 2 warriors,, 1 ranger, rogue, and sk)and after ending a long, hard fight and toping everyone up to 80% and being at 10% mana and seeing the phrase &quot;INC!!!&quot; that I've just wanted to say &quot;hope you can take it yourself because I'm not healin ya!&quot; but, alas, I can't and am then faced with either sticking around and seeing just how well DA works as an anti-taunt (I am still amazed =) or just sitting down and watching them all die and gating at the right moment.<br />
<br />
Too bad I hate the second option =)<br />
<br />
Often I will walk into Lguk and shout for groups, and never find one.  I walk into SolB, find one in 5 minutes amongst the rez requests I get.<br />
<br />
Although Ofbac, I must say you have it far worse than I do. I get turned down all the time when I offer to rez people because mine is simply not good enough for people.  I was once turned down by a level 24 druid because my rez wasn't worth the cost.  Funny how I saw his corpse and sent him a tell saying &quot;free rez since I can't find a group.&quot;<br />
<br />
I swear, one more &quot;what lvl cleric are you and can you rez me in unrest plz, okay fine brt, thanks for the rez bye, wheres my 50 plat 'user is not online'&quot; and I will swear off doing free rezzes.<br />

My wife is a 47th bard and I find her bard quite entertaining to play.  The complexity of play is very fun, if a bit tiring. I'm more of a game jockey then she is and had to teach her how to charm-kite two cyclopses at a time back when she was in the mid thirties.<br />
<br />
My alt necro is also very fun from a game mechanics standpoint. Being a 2 way energy (mana to HP and back) is very interesting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobchak Billdozer</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm amazed at how we are almost invisible if we're doing our job well.  The tanks finish a battle at near full health, everyone's got lots of AC/HP buffs.  We're still sitting like we've never moved.  &quot;Damn, this is soo easy!&quot; someone says. But by golly, what happens if we go LD, or camp? <br />
 I've come back an hour later to groups that were pretty boring to be in (never dropped below 60% while healing); after I left, they simply exploded (even w/shamans / druids / pallys)   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif That's a good feeling.  Knowing that even w/other chars that technically COULD cast gheal, the group couldn't function w/o a cleric.<br />
That's one of the few satisfactions after hours of staring at red bars and blue bars.  Then hitting &quot;2 (sit/stand) F2 (tank) 3 (supe heal)2 wait 2 F5 (enthusiastic Wiz/Druid) 5 (Gheal) 2&quot;  Although now that I can look around and med, I do loot more often...so that's exciting too I guess    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, Thortak is still hands down my favorite, but everyone needs a break once in a while...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Illyna</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I do get tired of it too.<br />
<br />
In my year of playing a cleric I have taken 3 extended breaks to either play another class or break from EQ altogeather.<br />
<br />
The situation that Erondil mentions is exactly the kind of rush that makes me love my cleric. When I am in a situation like that and I still find myself ho-humming then I know its time for a break.<br />
<br />
I never know how long I'll break from my cleric before hand. I just know when I get the desire to play him so bad that I don't want to do anything else.<br />
<br />
As a side note, my warrior friend (grouped for the last 6 months) and I have a few alts and we just recently managed to group for the first time with two of them.<br />
<br />
His is a cleric and mine is a warrior lol. Too much fun to be on the other side of the coin.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way, I have never felt unappreciated in the last 6 months while playing my cleric. And it is true that sometimes the best attention you can get as a cleric is no attention at all. I love it when I spend a whole evening hidden, means I had a good night.<br />

<br />
Hehehe..  That's why no one sees Salina much anymore.  I got tired of feeling like everyone's get out of death free card.<br />
<br />
Barding is very challenging.. and now that I have a good idea of what to look for in a &quot;good&quot; group (intelligence is number one, of course), I have even more fun with her.<br />
<br />
Sob - find me sometime if you're around, I can always use a good cleric.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">07-14-2000, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If this helps:<br />
<br />
You do your job well. People don't say anything. You keep doing your job well. People still don't say anything. You keep doing your job well. <br />
<br />
(This isn't where it ends)  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
You get asked to go places, where clerics are needed - This is a compliment, they're asking you, simply because you do that job WELL. They can ask another cleric. They don't. That tells you something.<br />
<br />
Later on, people start getting to the point where they're used to NOT dying when you're there. Where they don't yell HEAL ME!, and they don't get upset if they do die, since the party is in godawful shape when they do... <br />
<br />
Over time, they learn that if there's any way you can keep them standing, it would already have been done. That's about the best compliment they could pay ya, imho.<br />
<br />
I've grouped with Machia, I was her tank once. I like tanking, and I like being a cleric, and gotta tell ya, I didn't say a word to her about her job, and she didn't say a word to me about mine, but we do discuss cleric strategy in groups, dungeons we like, different kinds of mobs, fun things, and it makes the time pass very well. She did an awesome job keeping us alive through constant pulls, we kept killing things, and that's pretty much what it's about. I would be happy with either role in the group, healing or tanking, just so long as I was having fun, and passing the time.<br />
<br />
I guess in all my time as a cleric, I've found no comment, to be a very large compliment, if they're not commenting, you're doing something so well, they're taking it for granted. They're not checking their health. That's a pretty big compliment. Take some heart in that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobchak Billdozer</div><div class="date">07-17-2000, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well hello Elian/Salina!  Of course I remember you!  I love having a good bard around.  I've missed seeing ya.  I'm still hanging around Frontier Mtns (although I haven't played at all in the last week or two). I would be delighted to hook up with you again   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am almost 47 with my primary, my human cleric.  Looking forward to start on my purple suit of EM!<br />
<br />
But in the calendar year since I started him (50 played days) I have also:<br />
<br />
levelled a troll warrior to 27<br />
levelled a halfling druid to 20<br />
levelled a DE necro to 14<br />
levelled a lizzie shaman to 20<br />
<br />
so you can see that I have had to take more than 1 break to make sure I don't give up on being a cleric.<br />
<br />
I feel like my cleric should have the worst set of knees in the world from just constantly standing up and sitting down.<br />
