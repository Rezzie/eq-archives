<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Criswell</div><div class="date">12-02-1999, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many times have you been urgently called to RES someone under the premise that they’re going to lose their corpse soon only to arrive and find a naked corpse that a player has already looted – looking only to gain back XP. Sure, they’ll probably be willing to pay you a hefty sum for the RES ( I typically see 200pp being offered), but I pose this question: What does this have to do with role playing?<br />
<br />
What is transpiring in these instances is a utilization of the game rules to benefit, in essence, the numeric value of the character. It’s a loophole that reflects an unrealistic role-playing transaction, and although Verant supposedly made SOME change to minimize it (shortened lifespan of corpse after looting, or something like that), it’s still being done quite frequently.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me that when you’re back on your feet in full armor gaining XP through combat, the prospect of seeking out a Cleric to get back XP for an incident prior should not be allowed. It’s my understanding that the role-playing concept behind RES is to bring back someone from the dead in a certain respect. If the player is already alive again and fighting, then a mockery is being made of this concept.<br />
<br />
How does one stop this action? Simple – loot one item off your corpse and you can no longer be RES’d. I’d also argue that you can no longer be RES’d if you get within a certain distance of your corpse.<br />
<br />
Certainly, Clerics would lose out on opportunities to make some good money; but I feel this spell is being abused, countering the spirit of role playing. Does this make any sense?<br />

Some people like to rp, some don't.<br />
Some people like you role play hard core, with all the funny speech, and some don't.<br />
It's all how you want to play. I would be extremely upset if they nerfed res yet again.<br />
Ok, so it looks a bit funny to Res someone standing over there corpse, should we make it so you don't respawn when you die? That is pretty unrealistic... Or maybe you should not be able to loot you corpse at all. If you have a problem with Ressing someone who is &quot;alive&quot; then don't do it. Simple solution.<br />
<br />
I mean, why bother with the last 2 resses with your point of view? The only addition they have is to give you back xp..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Criswell</div><div class="date">12-02-1999, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point does not argue that it’s wrong to give back XP lost. My point is that it’s a manipulation of the rules, using them as they probably weren’t intended to be used, to resses someone who’s already looted his corpse and moved on.<br />
<br />
The issue probably comes down to role play vs. non-role play and I understand your point Whackem; if you don’t role play, a change like this would certainly disappoint you. Of note, however, almost all of the significant nerfs (druid’s kiting, monk’s FD, etc.) were clearly explained as modifications which addressed player’s utilization of certain game aspects in a manner that was not intended. I can’t believe that Verant intended RES to be used like this.</div></div><hr />

(I do agree with you somewhat, and see your point, but I still think the solution is to just not res them.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llew Lifebringer</div><div class="date">12-02-1999, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the two hour limit was imposed, I sent feedback on this topic, with much the same suggestion someone made here.  <br />
<br />
Once something is looted from a body, don't allow a res at all, experience or otherwise.  *Then* axe the 2 hour limit.  If someone wants to hang around naked for several hours, that's fine, but I bet it won't happen very often.  However, it'd make late night play a lot safer if you can go to bed when you die (or to work, or whatever,) and know you'll be able to get that res later.  But it won't be an effective strategy to go play naked a while leaving an item on your corpse waiting for a cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, then you couldn't res yourself in many cases. Now *that* would suck ;-)<br />

People get ressed because the XP return is awesome, otherwise people would go out of their way to ask for revive. Clerics above 49 aren't always handy, what do you propose that people wait, naked, hoping a cleric comes on before they expire, unable to fight anything or go anywhere involved. Screw that. If that's RP'ing then RP'ing sucks.  <br />
