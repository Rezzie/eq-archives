Plus they hit like old ladies too, max I've seen them hit for is around 74, so if your used to velious or kunark, these guys are a cake walk..  Even easier if you hook up with a mage.. Solo'd for about an hour our there and then a mage friend came out and we were constant pulling these guys..  The exp flowed like fine elven wine.. I told my guild about this as well, and someone said they were good till 54th... so have a blast guys..<br />

I personally went through 51 and 52 in OoT. You'll start seeing greens at 52, but it's tolerable until 54 - that's when they really start greening out. The only drawback is finding a group... it's bring your own group type of place.</div></div><hr />
