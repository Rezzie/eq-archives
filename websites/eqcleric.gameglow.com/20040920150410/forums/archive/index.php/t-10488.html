It's easy to find a group of 20-25 (and I still make good XP in a 6-person, L25 group).  The xp is good but not awesome, the loot is good but not awesome...but it's fun!  The outer area right by the zone border is -really- easy to camp and hold.  Trains can be a problem but they've VERY easily avoided - I've had 2 deaths caused by trains, total, in 3 RL days - certainly a better ratio than Unrest.  ;p  There's rarely more than 25 people in the whole zone, so there's no crowding.  There's also just -something- satisfying about smacking Tier'dal around left and right.  ;&gt;</div></div><hr />
