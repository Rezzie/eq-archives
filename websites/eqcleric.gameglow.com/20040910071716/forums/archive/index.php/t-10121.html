<br />
I was feeling greedy and wondering if I could trade this for efreeti boots and that +wisdom belt from bilge in Dagnor's.<br />
<br />
Anyone think I would get a bite on that trade?<br />

<br />
Just let all of us know!<br />

Ok, I know that's kinda harsh, but this is one of those &quot;priceless&quot; items...don't let it go unless you are completely happy with the trade...then it will be a good trade! <br />
I would'nt be suprised to see someone pay 5k pp and up for this item, (depending on difficulty of the new quest) or trade some equally worthy rarity. <br />
Good Luck!<br />

It comes down to the fact that they CAN NEVER get this item as things stand now, it is *supposed* to come back as a quest, but it hasn't yet.  With enough time and effort, you can get the efreeti boots as well as the belt, however, they can't get a manastone.  Personally, i'd strip down all my twinks to nothing if i wanted one, and some people have some pretty nice twinks =)</div></div><hr />
