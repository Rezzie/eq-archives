We've agreed to keep a list of names of those who auction off our armor at astronomical prices.  Those people will never get a res from any of us.  We're sharing the list between ourselves, and telling every cleric we know or meet.  No one has thought this is a bad idea  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  We will tell anyone we see selling the armor pieces at an unfair price, what the possible consequences of this may be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only downside I see is that it may get out of hand and be abused.  Such as you see someone camping a spot for thier friend and Joe Cleric comes by and says you better stop camping this spot or you'll never get a rez.  I have had friends help me in getting some of my pieces so I see this as the only problem.  But if you keep it to only those who are selling the items then yes I can see this working.<br />

So more power to you<br />

<br />
I have a friend who plays a paladin in our group.  He is the single most wonderful person on the server as far as I'm concerned.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Unfortunately, he's east coast, and I'm west coast (along with most of the rest of our guild) so he has usually 3-5 hours before any of us come on.  He started a druid as a secondary (and dear GOD he's made 35th in about... well at least a quarter of the time it took me   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ).  <br />
<br />
In his boredom, he occasionally looks for things for me (which is how I got my cleric breastplate).  He and I took out Dwigus, then he ported us to Runnyeye to get Sludge.  Both of those times, there were no other people camping either spawn.  However, at one point while he was looking for Mitty, Maugrim spawned (someone I'd been trying to get for over a month, never saw the nasty tart once).  He killed her, and as he was looting her a cleric arrived.  Since he was getting the piece for me, does that make him a bastard?  It's kind of a bummer, since druids (at least on Bert) have a bad name for being farmers, selling what they can't use for massive profit or trading.<br />
<br />
I myself will not buy any armor for my bard from people who aren't bards that are selling it.  In my opinion, the class-specific armors should be gotten by the class they were intended for.  A perfect example is the hordes of people selling crafted armor.  Every zone I enter I see at least one person selling crafted &quot;cheap&quot; for some reason.  Argh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breeze</div><div class="date">04-12-2000, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our idea was not about those camping it for others, Salina  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  It was more directed at those camping our armor with the intent to sell it to us at prices that are way above the cost to get it.  Max cost as you know is about 200 pp, those selling the armor for 750+ pp are our real targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">04-14-2000, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats quite a good idea! I think I'll cross-post this to our guild forum to enhance the idea.<br />
<br />
ALSO! On a side note, the other day I was auctioning off a NS Wreath hoping to get some nifty cleric stuff with when a 48 ranger sends me a tell offering me a cleric BP for it, and I think, hmmmm may as well, got the wreath for 500pp, thats a pretty good price for the bp, when he DARES to tell me the time it took HIM to camp the bp components and the pain that it was for him to get the BP.  THEN he says that its worth in excess of 2kpp!<br />
<br />
I asked him if it was for another character of his that maybe he was deleting or something like that, and the answer? Nope, just a good trade piece.<br />
<br />
He then ripped into the &quot;ease of obtaining the ns wreath&quot; and that he could easily solo it, and I said it was pretttty darn impressive that he could do that, and I left it at that.  Not only did he start screaming at me so much that I had to put him on ignore, he told a friend of mine (who I've been friends with on eq for around 4 or 5 months) that I was a &quot;bad cleric&quot; and &quot;should never be trusted in a group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ironically, he was selling her a Lambent BP.<br />

It is pretty expensive, too, BPs go for about 3-5K, the least expensive are the boots, at around 500-800 pp.  I have a BP, boots, and legs right now.  I got them all myself, with a little help from my friend on Bilge.(back before the changes)  I only ran into one camper, so far, and that was getting the ingot for the legs.  I reasoned with her, and told her that I needed it more than her, and that I was there first.  She resisted, but when I told her that my next move would be to petition a GM for her breaking the PNP.  She left without a word.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

This sounds like a great idea. Send me a tell in-game, k?<br />
<br />
If you're having problems getting your BP, send me a tell there too.. I'll give you a hand. <br />
<br />
Bloody farmers...<br />

Got a few damned dr00ds farming the cleric armor too, that I've seen.<br />

I don't think this will be the issue. This is directed at those people who camp our armor for the specific perpose of gouging clerics on prices. I don't mind some one being reasonable on their prices. I could see a 10 - 15 % mark up on their out of pocket cost for the item, but some of these people are making thousands of plat by simply camping and re-camping our armor. As far as not hunting aviaks. I ALWAYS let a warrior come and loot the charm as I do not need it nor will I farm another classes armor to make money. If I do end up with another classes quest piece, I will either a) finish it on my own when I have the spare time and plat, then sell it to some one who needs it at cost plus no more than 10% or b) if someone of that class can bring me the other components, I will finish it for nothing.<br />
<br />
Does this not sound fair to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breeze</div><div class="date">04-25-2000, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanzin is exactly correct  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  We really aren't watching those camping the armor.  It's those who sell it at the bazaar for outrageous prices who we don't like  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I've never camped another's quest with the intent of selling the reward.  I really don't have the time or the inclination.  If you want to camp our armor with the intent of selling it to us, at least charge a reasonable price  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  That's all I'm trying to accomplish, here.  I'm getting it by myself, for myself.  I won't pay for it, and try to be reasonable when i see it for sale at ungodly prices.  Most people only see the profit, and the sting (res blackball) is the only thing some people will pay attention to  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
This isn't something I particularly like, but I will not take the farming of our quest items meekly.  I will fight back with all the  weapons at my disposal.  Withholding Res is the best one we have.  I'd much rather see the armor become no drop, frankly  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rathgar</div><div class="date">04-27-2000, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry i had one of those days glad no one flamed my spelling after reading my post today i thought wow did i go nuts or what what i should say now that im calm a rational during yet more server down time is if their were not clerics paying those outrageious prices the other classes would prolly not farm the armor peices and no drop is a good idea now as far as the black list goes i prolly wouldent rez them say if we were in a group and they said lets roll for it i would be omg this part is for cleric armor the reason we formed the group was to get the peice and you want to roll wtf that person should go on the list but not ppl that are selling after all they did the work and deserve some reward and profit( why do i feel like im digging a deeper hole ) ill shut up now or should i say black list only those that are completly rude in a group and take the icon ingot and thoes who just come up and whack the critter and see you looking for it and take it any way the rest just ignore and pass the word to only by the armor from fellow clerics if you have to buy it maby this post is more reasable and thaanks for ignoring my spellin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breeze</div><div class="date">04-27-2000, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
as i said before, i don't mind some profit.  It's those charging three to four hundred percent markup i object to  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Three hundred plat is not an unreasonable amount, and allows the seller 100pp profit  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  750pp is way out of line, in my opinion, and i've seen pieces for sale for FAR more than that.  (saw the bp auctioned for 1500 pp, once, and just laughed at the person)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elessara</div><div class="date">04-28-2000, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also have to look at it like this.  Many pieces for the warrior armor are random/rare drops from common mobs in the zone.  Same thing for many of the pieces for SK armor, bard armor, ranger armor, shaman armor, etc.  Then take a look at the cleric armor quests.  They are either A) items which spawn on the ground and can be picked up by anyone or B) camp a rare named mob for the piece.  From what I can remember, the only piece that doesn't fit this profile is a part for the arms, in which you give tumpy tonics to an npc and he hands you the item.<br />
Cleric armor quests require you to camp a specific mob - not a specific type of mob ... i.e. cleric armor quests have mobs of which there are only ever one of them running around at once like Dwigus or Regis not like the griffenes or aviaks.  So, non-clerics camping these mobs are either doing it for a friend or doing it to make a large profit.<br />
