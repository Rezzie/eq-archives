<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kair</div><div class="date">08-30-2000, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone! As my post count would indicate, I'm very new to this board.  I am not however new to EverQuest, I've been playing for quite a while.  I've tried many classes and races, and think I finally found a class and race I can play into the high levels.  At this time, my highest level character is a level 36 ranger.  My cleric is already level 15.  I guess what I'm wondering is...how many others have recently started a cleric and have really fallen in love with the class?  To the point you can see your new cleric becoming your main character after a while...<br />
<br />
Also, any advice for a new cleric, (I'm level 15 and I play with a warrior) would be appreciated.  Things like timing stuns and that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Thanks all of you.  And I'm happy to be here.<br />

<br />
I started my first character as a cleric after spending a lot of time researching into what I actually wanted to play and I've been playing him ever since.  I do have a 2nd character as a 31 Barbarian Warrior, but pretty much play the cleric full time.<br />

My cleric was my second character, after discovering that a shadowknight was not right for me.  He's been my primary character ever since.<br />
<br />
You'll find that most of the regular posters to this board are seasoned veterans, not only with playing a cleric, but of the game as a whole.  You should be able to find information on just about every facet of playing a cleric here.<br />
<br />
I only offer one bit of advice....experiment.  Experiment with your spells, healing tactics, battle tactics, grouping/soloing tactics, etc.  Use the insight you gain here well, young jedi  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

I'm another ranger turned cleric, too.  While I always have, and always will, love the ranger class, there's no doubt that in EQ, very few classes were designed as well as clerics to fulfill their role.  If you enjoy helping people, and it sounds like you do, you couldn't have picked a better class.<br />
<br />
My advice - don't forget you can gate now.  I don't know how many times I've caught myself making a town run, then running back to my bind point.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

I wanted a dwarven cleric as soon as I heard about the game. Its what I loved in D&amp;D, and I love it here, although there are many many drastic differences. I can't seem to get any other alternate characters above level 5 or so...<br />

But my enchanter which was my first character and will remain primary. But either way I go, I'll always be able to find a group  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif . They are both truly fun to play, but it seems that an enchanter is more fun at high lvls, while a cleric is more enjoyable at the lower lvls, I could be wrong though.<br />

Sit back, grab an Ale from the bartender and wait...<br />
<br />
You'll get flooded with information.<br />
<br />
My advice...simple yet always at lower levels. (Hehe only 28 Myself)<br />
<br />
* Mem Divine Aura always. It will save your butt or your groups.<br />
<br />
* Melee while you can, after a while its just something to do to break the medding/stunning ect...<br />
<br />
* Look for some cheap mana gear at low levels, and you can't beat banded if your STR is not high.<br />
<br />
* Dont forget to bind, and bind in a safe spot<br />
<br />
* The root and run or root and gate helps if you get rushed by a nasty blue con. (LOL solo no group hehe)<br />
<br />
* Let the Tanks get soem HP down on the MOB before you heal if you can. (BTW guys, I have become a rooting machine with my tag team Tank bodygaurd in Lake of Ill Omen. I ALWAYS get roots on the mobs before a heal.)<br />
<br />
Hehe thats it from me, have  blast, you are the person in Norrath that allows others do go way above and beyond what they should be able to do. <br />
<br />
Hehe my outlook:<br />
<br />
&quot;I have FM, thats about 6 Greater Heals with out medding. With medding, depends on how fast you hit. Either way you at least have 4 lives of HP fully buffed to kill this thing.&quot;<br />

<br />
it is always easiest to raise your defence as you level than it is to go back later and fix it.<br />
<br />
If you have to, tell the tanks that you are training defence and then root the mob and crowd it.<br />
<br />
I actually like to team up with a rogue when I do this, it can be a very effective battle tactic in its own right.<br />
<br />
Also, buff healing is a very useful trick.<br />

I've heard it's more effective that way even though the buff doesn't heal as much, it's supposed to cost less mana to heal correct?<br />
<br />
And as for stunning, I'm trying to learn, but I really need advise about the timing.  I seem to always be casting stun after the mob has gotten off his heal...or is burning my tank.  &lt;grins&gt;<br />

<br />
&quot; so and so mob begins to cast a spell...&quot;<br />
<br />
chances are yours will be faster....when you get more stuns, you will end up stunning for fun ( ie: keeping it stunned) and leving one ready for emergency ( mob is casting ) duty<br />
<br />
<br />
with stuns, as with fear, and root, always know who in group will be doing it.....its just as silly to have everyone stunning  as it is to have everyone healing</div></div><hr />

Ah, a new face. Hope you'll stick around  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Buff healing works where you use one of the Courage line of spells to heal a party member. Courage itself can't do this and Center is not mana efficient. I think Daring (19) is the first spell you can use effectively to heal with. The higher you go, the more effective the heal (ie Resolution is a more efficient heal than Greater Healing)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

It's the only other character that I've actually enjoyed playing and actually gotten past the 10th level.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I'm sure I've made a character of at least every class, and the cleric is just too good.  One thing I love most is that it is so easy to get into group.  Just shout that you're a cleric looking for a group, and bam.  It's amazing.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graymane</div><div class="date">08-30-2000, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I came to love my cleric in a round about way.  I don't have a ton of time to play, but when I first started, I started a dwarven cleric and took him to 22.  Then I got a bad case of class envy and played 4 more characters into the 20-30 range.  Then I quit the game for awhile and came back and started two new clerics.  There are a few things that I always noticed about NOT playing a cleric:<br />
<br />
- Your group is limited about what it can do without one.<br />
- Your group often breaks up when the cleric has to leave.<br />
- I decided that I really DID like medding, watching the battle and flow of things and being responsible for keeping people alive  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kair</div><div class="date">08-30-2000, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Graymane:<br />
<br />
Interesting you say you decided you liked medding and watching the flow of battle.<br />
<br />
With my ranger, I was always in the heat of the fight.  Sometimes I would sit after a fight and wonder...what just happened... especially if someone died, or an entire group died.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, it's really easy to remain calm looking at your spell book...watching the text scroll and watching HP bars of the group.  I really enjoy being the support in the fight now.  I think I was too anxious before to be the &quot;taunter/protector&quot; now my role is the same, but in a different way.  I'm the &quot;healer/protector&quot; interesting the way that works.<br />
<br />
I'm having such a great time with my cleric I havn't played my ranger in weeks.  And it is very interesting to be un-anon in a zone and have people actually send me /tells to ask me to join their group.<br />
<br />
I like it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kandolek</div><div class="date">08-30-2000, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other thing to remember about stunning is that at level 15, most the cast time for most spells is not much longer than our first stun.  This makes it hard to interrupt a lot of spells even with our fast casting level 5 stun unless you cast the stun immediately after the mob starts casting.  As you go up in level, the mobs casting time increases and it gets easier.<br />
<br />
The second technique, if you have multiple stuns, is to just chain cast the stuns every couple seconds so that the mob is permanently stunned and never has a chance to cast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarf</div><div class="date">08-30-2000, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 29, and defer to the folks on this board who have been playing longer.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
buff healing is something I have done since I got center.  I do it during battle.  I usually kept center memmed (until I got better ones).  What I do is buff everyone with my highest level buff.  Mobs tend to get on some of your casting partners and they do not have the hp or ac as other group members.  After you play a while, you will know how long your buff lasts.  Every once in a while, recast the buff as a heal.  That way you do not have to ever refresh that buff.  It keeps your party buffed and is a heal at the same time which reduces downtime.<br />
<br />
Root and stun are great, experiment with them all the time.  I learned about that on this board.  I did not find them tremendously effective till I was in my 20's.  (but then I didn't start reading this board till then either).  Druids like snare a lot, and actually, so do I, it can be very effective, doesn't break like root does and a snared runner won't hit your party.  Rooting monsters is a great anti taunt for your caster buddies.  If a monster is hitting the druid, park it and the druid can med in peace.<br />
<br />
Using socials to cast is a really good idea, you should use them for DA and heals especially.<br />
<br />
DA should be always memmed, and do not be afraid to use it.  It comes back in ten minutes, is a great anti taunt.  When hunting in unrest, my group would have to run for it, I would stay behind to loot all the corpses of the recently slain monsters and waddle to the zone.  I cast DA before I get jumped and only died a half a dozen times or so out of around a hundred times doing it (my guildies still tease me about it).  It is not fail safe, but it refreshes pretty quick really, and you should start using it now so you remember to use it when you need it.  When you heal a tank and 4 monsters start beating on you, cast it and watch them ALL immediately leave you and get back to the business of beating on your tank.<br />
<br />
Clerics really get pretty decent DD spells starting at 14, and you need to keep in mind at the level you are at that sometimes Clerics are great nukers.  You can often save a ton of mana by nuking runners or just plain nuking.  Dead monsters don't hit your friends.  You can heal 100 poitns with a heal or you can smite for 80 for about the same mana.  If you are hunting with a druid or ranger who snares a mob it will turn its back and not fight.  If you can nuke it to that point, you can sit and med while your tanks beat on it unmolested.<br />
<br />
My cleric is a char that I made by accident, about number 8 and I have had so much fun I can not conceive of playing another as a primary.  Although the rogue and enchanter are a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Lastly, many of the folks on this board know a lot more than I do, I am just remembering my experience at your level and what worked for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimdor</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only 16(damn evil eye stealing my level), but one of the things I've found most useful is to know how much mana your spells are going to take.  It's much easier to ride the edge if you know when you stand the heal will go off (and if you fizzle everyone dies).  Tanks know what &quot;two heals left&quot; means much more than &quot;30% mana&quot;.  Along those same lines, have a cheeper secondary heal (or buff/heal) for when your mana estimates are off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And as to knowing who is stunning - it nevers hurts to have too many stuns (it may increase downtime slightly but it never hurts). Then of course there is stun fun, when we pull TTs in fear (a massive dispell) and all the paladins, clerics and enchanters form a line and start stunning the foul critter as soon as it gets in range.<br />
<br />
When we get just one, we can usually kill it without a single meelee attack (the nukers chime in a well - but 4-5 paladins, 4 clerics and 3 enchanters make for a hefty stun brigade)<br />
