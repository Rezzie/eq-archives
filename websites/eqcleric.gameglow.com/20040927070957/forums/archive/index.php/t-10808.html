<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">03-12-2001, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I ended up hunting in Temple of Veeshan's test wing Sunday.  To sum it up, it was a blast!  We went with 3 teams, no they <br />
weren't completely balanced, we had no warriors, only 1 enchanter.  We were able to clear quite a number of racnors, wyvverns, <br />
fiery guardians, and guardian ice wurms.  It felt like a mini VP raid.  We did have one wipe out, but I was bound outside so it <br />
made the CR take all of 5min =).  <br />
<br />
There is a close nit group of people on BB that are on friendly dragon faction so we have been forming together gathering Yelinak <br />
faction and prepping for ToV.  One nice feeling hunting the test wing is we wont be competing for resources.  While the Kael <br />
people are starting to make waiting lists and such, we are going to be hunting at our leisure.<br />
<br />
I do strongly suggest for people wanting to go there, to get your fire and cold resists high.  Everything there so far has an AE fire <br />
or cold based breath.  We even ran into a wyvvern that had a HP/mana dot.  Some of our people would be sitting with C2 on, <br />
and still not regaining any mana. <br />
<br />
I can't wait to go back again.  Was a great first time there!<br />

<br />
How does the halls of testing compare to the drake hunting?<br />
<br />
It seems my guild has gone mostly for Kael faction, so I need to pick up some friends for Halls of Testing.<br />
<br />
We had 3 groups 55+ for drakes, so could that same force do the halls of testing?<br />

<br />
pulling is difficult thanks to the way feign works in SoV, you need a monk who is able to work the feign/casting thing, thankfully you wont get too many 2 warrior type mob pulls, however just tell your puller he should expect to die quite a bit, the failed feign rate is quite high.<br />
<br />
1 60 warrior is all you really need if you are pulling solo's, with the new taunt changes he should be one of the only people to be able to taunt the mob well.<br />
<br />
Dont have your enchanter tash until the mob is 70%, or they will die, all but glimmer drakes can be slowed<br />
<br />
have to run now, more info to come later =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siren</div><div class="date">03-13-2001, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple questions for those of you that have actually hunted in the Halls of Testing portion of Temple of Veeshan.  (To clarify, I mean people who are on good faction with dragons, not people killing the ToV zone in mobs for Kael quested armor).<br />
<br />
1.  Is it really that easy that 3 semi-balanced groups have no problem, even with all those rangers?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  (j/k)<br />
<br />
2.  Is it impossible for people who do NOT have good dragon faction to join in on the hall of testing raids?<br />
<br />
3.  Is there any faction associated with the Halls of Testing mobs?<br />
<br />
4.  Were you able to complete any of the ToV quests and if so, were they worth it?   What other kinds of drops did you see?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyvern G</div><div class="date">03-13-2001, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok little more info.  all blue drakes are clerics, most glimmer/brown drakes are druids and have sow and WILL run if not dispelled.  everything needs to be sieved in order for it not to gate non stop.<br />
<br />
the 3 DoT are Acid Jet, Thunder Blast, and Slime mist.<br />
<br />
Slime is a nasty hp dot which can be cured by torpor.  Thunder blast is the worst, hardcore hp/mana debuff, can be cured by lvl 60 ench buff gift of brilliance, dont know cure for aciud jet but its  weenie dot anyways =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">03-13-2001, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. It was a very fun challenge.  No it wasnt easy.  If it was easy, it would have bored me to tears.<br />
<br />
2. Its not &quot;impossible&quot;.  We brought Xarina with us last trip and shes still kos but is working her faction to positive CoV.  We had <br />
to COH her to the test wing, and you cant even cross the doorway else you will be attacked.  Once you move down inside you <br />
should be fine.<br />
<br />
3. No<br />
<br />
4. No, from what I gather they are along the same as Plane of Sky quests.  You need a common, common, and a rare drop off <br />
the named ones.  So not expecitng any quest completed soon.<br />

at the zone in for the Kael goobs.  Id say the Test wing mobs drop more than the giants in Kael.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">03-14-2001, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild went into ToV to kill mobs for Kael quest armor, we went in last thursday and has since then gotten 199 drops (at last count, tuesday night.) This is not counting the few armors that invitees to the raid got, only drops that went to guildmembers.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the plate BP has been seriously underrepresented...only one has dropped sofar.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be at all surprised if the drops are nerfed in the patch today...I just hope they don't do it across the board, the BP/robes are rarer than the other drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyvern G</div><div class="date">03-14-2001, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, we must have 200+ pieces as well, yet no plate bps.<br />
<br />
many leather tunics, chain bp, and silk robe, the plate bp eludes us however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyvern G</div><div class="date">03-14-2001, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How does the Akkirus armor compare to the Templar's?<br />
<br />
I know the warrior and paladin armor compares so that the SS quests have less AC and a bit more stats, and the Kael have a higher AC and lots of +hp and mana, but not as much stats.<br />
<br />
It seems like SS is better caster armor, because even upgraded the kael quest caster armor isnt that much of an improvement over even PoG stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">03-14-2001, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you can really say that &quot;Skyshrine is better&quot; or &quot;Kael is better&quot;.<br />
<br />
It really comes down to what other pieces of what armor you already have.<br />
<br />
I suppose if you are talking about the whole suit, I would prefer Skyshrine stuff, because as a cleric, I take lots more damage from AE spells then from melee.<br />
<br />
I think the differences between them are not too much to worry about tho.<br />

Been here for about 3.5 hours now.<br />
We've only gotten 1 drop from all the drakes we've pulled, and only 1 spell (crappy 55 wrath of elements).  We've managed to kill 2 ancient wurms and one dropped 2 pieces (silk boots, leather bracer) and the other dropped 1 leather legs.  From what I've heard about drops it's a lot worse, I never made it here before patch tho...<br />
<br />
The ench hasn't been tashing and the shaman's haven't been able to land slow on anything.  MoK is resisted 100% by a 59 cleric....<br />
