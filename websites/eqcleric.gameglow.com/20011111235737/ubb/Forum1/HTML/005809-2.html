</FONT><HR>Celestial Healing does cause aggro, but since that first tick is only about 150 points of healing the initial aggro is minimal. By the time the other ticks kick in your tanks have had the opportunity to build up the hate neccessary to mask the rest of the aggro.<P>You can see that there is additional aggro if on a multi pull the puller stops for mez, moves, stops for mez, moves, the third and fourth mobs generally will come for you.<P>4k is cheap for the effectiveness of this spell. Mages pay 15k and up for call of the hero.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Rayne and others who suggest that clerics have no business complaining about drop rates are just flat wrong.<P>First off, the shaman spells you mention are obscenely rare.  They are also post 55 spells are they not?  Cel Heal is much rarer then Divine Light.  At least, I never see anyone begging for the chance to buy DL.  <P>Also, just because shammy spells are rare does not mean that other classes spells should be rare as well.  You have no idea what a helpful spell this is at level 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50,51, 52, 53, 54, ....  Yes, because you are uber.  You were there first. You have not been in Hate and had higher level clerics say wistfully to you "You have that spell?"<P>I seem to recall a thread or two complaining about MoK nerfs.  About what a great spell it was, and how it allowed you to step outside the bounds of cleric drudgery.  Cel Heal does exactly that for clerics 44-59.  It gives us a chance to compete, have fun and enjoy being clerics. It gives us a chance to try out new things and be better then we otherwise would be.<P>And...., *****it is a 44 level spell******<P>To suggest that clerics go camp in Velk's Lab for it is quite frankly mean spirited.  I am happy to listen to your advice on a variety of topics, but not on this one.  You haven't camped the wurms for hours and hours and hours and hours to get a 44 level spell for your cleric.  Whatever else you may have done, you haven't done that.<P>With all due respect..., flame away<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I can use CelHeal on everyone, and CH on a few.... in 10s for 1 CH, I can have two people healing at a 4:1 ratio while I then med for a tick.<P>You are correct in if you want it, pay or camp... but that's what I hate about this firken game.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Celestial Healing really doesn't allow you to do anything you couldn't do otherwise, it just saves a few seconds here and there and gives you more options in pacing your heals. Yes, it does make clericing a bit less stressful, but no, it's not essential. I agree with the above, only Remedy and Complete Heal are essential to the post 50 cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

CH becomes more and more important with leveling anyway.<P>the following thought could be the reason for your opinion the spell isnt so in bad need:<BR>u joined to a guild with highlev clerics and go on raids with them. they use their 51+ healing spells and u only do CH or supH. so celeH is not really needed by u.<P>but if you are as i am usually in a group as the one and only healer and fighting through the world and camps you would know how strong celeH is. i am the only higher lev healer in our guild and have to do the res too. just imagine! i got the spell from a good paladin named galaorn who knows the topic and had to pay 800pp. i promised him to help him everytime i can and that is the way of the game, at least should be.<P>btw, all lev44 spells should be traded with the normal price till max of 1k. this is a good price for the camping time of them and nothing more. i hate capitalism in the game.<P>49 egon (always not anon)<BR>xev<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Frankly I'm just amazed that many of you have this attitude that the spell is an entitlement.<P>Tarf thinks that while it's ok for certain Shaman spells to be rare that should have zero bearing on Celestial Healing.  How can I possibly respond to that kind of thinking?  OF COURSE it's different because by golly WE'RE CLERICS and WE'RE SPECIAL.  Silly me.<P>Egon seems to think it's important because level 45 is a LONG level (not, it isn't just wait) and therefore Celestial Healing should have an artificial ceiling of 1k max placed upon it.  Damn, I have to wonder how I EVER kept people alive back in the day, you know, the days when there wasn't even a Remedy much less CelHealing.<P>I'll try this one more time:  CLERICS DO NOT DESERVES THEIR SPELLS TO BE MORE READILY AVAILABLE THAN ANY OTHER CLASS!  So quit whining already.  Other classes go through a lot of trouble to get their valuable spells and guess what, we Clerics have one spell that's semi-rare and very valuable.  Deal with it and quit this whining already.<P>I was level 56 when Velious opened.  I had a real big clue what Cel Healing could do when the 48 Cleric who grouped with me one night was using it constantly (he got it on the first night).  Sure I wanted it, but I didn't want it bad enough to camp green stuff for hours/days.  I looked around for the spell, couldn't find it, and wound up hitting 59 a few months later.<P>Celestial Elixir is so good that it has totally changed the way I play my Cleric.  I have a pretty good clue of what you can do with Cel Healing.  So what?  It doesn't mean we should have an easier time of it than any other class.  And it damned well shouldn't have some artificial price cap because it's good.  The fact that it's good drives up demand which in turn drives up price.  Pretty basic stuff.<P>I'm not sure if the disconnect I have with some of you is one of high level vs low level or conservative vs liberal (I bring the real life examples in because they fit the analogy real well).  Someone made a comment about charging 500pp for a res.  Go for it.  You might get it some times.  Eight resses at that price and theirs your 4k.  A Cleric who really wants to make money can certainly do so.  Those who don't have money don't want it badly enough to do what's necessary (e.g. charge for lots of resses is the easiest way).<P>Bah, this has gone on long enough.  I don't agree with the majority of you here.  My feeling is:<P>-> The spell is valuable.<BR>-> The spell is rare and therefore is not cheap to buy from other players.<BR>-> Deal with it already.<P>And in closing Tarf, telling people to hunt Kobolds in Velk's is not mean spirited, it's reality.  I saw the spell drop pretty frequently there so it seems reasonable to me to suggest that one go there to get it.  For Clerics sub-50 yes, it might be a problem for them to go there.  I suggest to them to spend more time leveling (possible without Cel Healing) so that they can go there.  They might even find it more fun than killing the same wurms for days on end.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It is simple supply and demand really.  Celestial healing is a mainline healing spell from 44-58.  That means there are a lot of clerics who want to buy it, thus high demand.  Coupled with low supply, due to rare drops, means a high price.  This is especially frustrating to the pre-50 clerics since they aren't able to compete in a bidding war with the mid 50s clerics.<P>You can't say the spell should be sold for 1000pp, because when someone auctions it for that price, what is to keep a cleric who really wants it from offering 4000pp or more to the seller?  I traded GEB for my copy of the Cel Healing, and I think I got the better end of the deal.<P>The price will come down in time, but that doesn't help everyone who doesn't have it now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I know that's how I got mine last night - it was given to me by my guild.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P> <P>------------------<BR>Tommara, Level 53 Vicar<BR>Tommar, Level 40 Ranger<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I just wanted to add in a few comments on Rayne's previous post.<P>>Frankly I'm just amazed that many of you >have this attitude that the spell is an >entitlement.<P>What you imply is correct.  No one is entitled to spells or items.  Our first 49 levels were nice because we had little work to do in acquiring our spells (ie..travel and money).  So why did Verant make some Kunark and Velious spells attainable by drops?  Perhaps it was an effort to differentiate between players of the same class (near the same spell rank).  <P>>Tarf thinks that while it's ok for certain >Shaman spells to be rare that should have >zero bearing on Celestial Healing. How can >I possibly respond to that kind of >thinking? OF COURSE it's different because >by golly WE'RE CLERICS and WE'RE SPECIAL. >Silly me.<P>What if the real problem is that all (or some) of these spells (for every class at upper levels) are dropping too infrequently?  If we were to agree that a Shaman's higher level spells are too rare, then there would be no sense in trying to justify Celestial Healing's drop rate by comparing to the drop rate of that Shaman's spells.<P><BR>>I'll try this one more time: CLERICS DO NOT >DESERVES THEIR SPELLS TO BE MORE READILY >AVAILABLE THAN ANY OTHER CLASS! <P>Correct.  But _maybe_ every class should have spells more readily available (be it via increase in drop rates or increase in drop locations or vendors to buy from)<P><BR>>I'm not sure if the disconnect I have with >some of you is one of high level vs low >level or conservative vs liberal (I bring >the real life examples in because they fit >the analogy real well). <P>It's possible that your posts (including the one above) are not worded the best way.  In fact, your previous made me think that you have the idea that you are above others.  I do not want to think that.  Please convince me otherwise.  <P>Urzak<BR>Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Now this is normally the point at which I explode and really start flaming.  But out of deference to Dalur I'll restrain myself =).<P>See Urzak's post directly preceeding mine (save the copy and paste space).<P><ul><li>Whether drop rates are sufficient for spells or not is frankly immaterial to this thread.  It may be the cause of the problem, but we're dealing with the reaction of some Clerics to it (at least that's what I'm talking about).  All classes have spells that are extremely valuable to them that are rare and the players who want those spells are sometimes charged through the nose to get them.  For example, Shaman Malo/Torpor/Tigirs, Mage Call of the Hero and 54 Water Pet, Necro 56 pet, and I'm sure many others are all rare and very expensive.  The value of CotH to a guild that raids a lot is really priceless.  I know a friend paid 5k for Translocate back when Velious first opened and was delighted to get it.  The argument that especially gets me is "I'm a Cleric and I need that spell to keep people alive so I should not have to pay much for it."  Every caster can make a similar argument about their valuable/rare spells.  Now since the playing field is level I'll go back to supply and demand determining price.  As long as Clerics are willing to pay a lot for it expect to (unless you get lucky and get a drop).  But the idea that it should be cheap to us because we are healers is very annoying to me.</li><BR><li>Whether drop rates should increase or not is again immaterial.  Let's deal with reality and if we want to start a new thread on drop rates of spells for all classes let's do it.  But that wasn't the point of this thread.</li><BR><li>Think whatever you wish about me.

</FONT><HR>Just gonna add my 2cp and leave it alond after this.<P>First, see my thread about how usefull CelHeal really is. Does owning this spell amke you a better cleric or does knowing your role and behaving responsibly make you a better cleric? I don't have it, and almost EVERY night I play I get praise from my group about how good of a cleric I am. <P>Now, I don't know if this means I am an excellent cleric or if there are alot of clerics who have no clue how to do a good job. I am sorta willing to believe it's the latter and there are alot of powerleveled guild twinkie clerics. I am a good cleric. I do a very effective job wthout CelHeal. And I am willing to boycott the high prices and refuse to buy this spell for more than 500pp. But Rayne is correct. As long as there are clerics willing to pay 4k for the spell, there will be people willing to sell it for 4k.<P>Second, I don't think it's about the rareity of a spell drop. If I were fortunate enough to get a spell that those shamans want, AND no one in my guild needs it, THEN I would sell it to them for a REASONABLE price OR give it to them outright. So far, I have purchased 4 cleric spells, each for 50pp or less (Kunark spells), and sold 1 for 50pp and have 1 I can't find a buyer for (necro spell, Convergence). All other spells I have looted I GAVE away. 3 to guildmembers, 1 to another cleric (an extra Sunskin spell).<P>My thing is, why price gouge another player for a spell, when you may have to rely on that person at a later date.<P>Thrid, and last, YES clerics on the whole are pampered. We don't have to research our spells. We don't have to collect pages or runes or words or anything else. We just have to stroll to the nearest temple and buy our spells. And a few (yes, just a FEW) of our spells are dropped. What is it? 5? 6? And 4 (yes, only FOUR) spells are "quested" for, through that dwarf in FV. So, we can buy all but 10 of our spells and, oh, woe is us, we gotta work for 10.<P>Get over it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I noticed he replied here stating that again.  But I don't think anyone here is saying we are any more entitled to it than another class... just that the drop is way too rare.<P>As for another person who posted here, it is NOT a level 44 spell, its a level 39 spell... at least according to casters realm it is.  The is absolutely no excuse it needs to be this rare a drop.  Let alone the fact they put it on level 50+ creatures also.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Just one last thing.....<P>I was not attempting to say that I thought it was right, good and proper that shaman spells are rare.  As I said above, some shaman spells are obscenely rare.  What I intended to communicate from that was my belief that shaman drop rates for those spells were *too* rare.  Why should those shaman have to go without spells.  Makes no sense to me.<P>As for the MoK reference which you ignored, the MoK nerf upset you Rayne.  That is why I referenced it.  Because I believed that directing you to a spell nerf which upset you, might cause you to appreciate this situation from a different perspective.  <P>Celestial Elixir is purchasable?  And it rocks?  Nuff said.<P>Many of your comments are rude Rayne.<P>If the fact that it is your board justifies them in your mind then that is fine I guess.  It is your board, might does in many instances make right.<P>But as you said to me long ago, we do not have to agree.  I will retain my opinion.  Just seems to me that if all clerics were united on some issues, it would make life easier for all of us.  And that includes MoK, Cel Heal drop rates, BP nerfs, as well as potential future nerfs (Can we all say Comp heal maxed at 1k someday? <----Please note, this is my own paranoia, and not officially or unofficially mentioned by anyone at VI).<P>Again, with all due respect, flame on<P>Tarf<P>[Edited to correctly identify Celestial Elixir as the spell purchasable from vendors rather then Divine Light]<p>[This message has been edited by Tarf (edited 03-22-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/005809-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/005809.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005809&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005809&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
