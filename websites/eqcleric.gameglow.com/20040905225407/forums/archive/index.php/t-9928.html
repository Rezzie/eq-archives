I think this is the reason why so many of us are poor, we NEVER get to loot.  I was grouped with my brother in CC just the other night and when we left, he, a monk who was looting corpses while I medded, came out with 75 plat while I only had 12.<br />
<br />
I think this is why so many times we are defaulted gems when they drop...</div></div><hr />

I'd be surprised if you have been in a group where they said you can not loot for med reasons.  If they do say that to you, you have every right to ask them how you get your share of the day's loot.</div></div><hr />

and yes, please give the monks jewelry instead of PP(droppable), they love it when me do that.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
