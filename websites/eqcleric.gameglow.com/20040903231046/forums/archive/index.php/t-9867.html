<br />
Some stupid warrior in Oasis dies on the docks after training a Sand Giant there.  I was just barely zoning into Oasis from South Ro, and this warrior is BEGGING for a ressurect.<br />
<br />
a_warrior_01 tells you, 'hi can I get a rez'<br />
<br />
You tell a_warrior_01, 'I don't have any ressurects.<br />
<br />
a_warrior_01 tells you, 'you f'ing liar, you get one at 29 i played a cleric to 50'<br />
<br />
You tell a_warrior_01, 'I'm afraid I don't have any experience ressurects.<br />
<br />
a_warrior_01 tells you, 'then at least f'ing revive me!!!!!!!'<br />
<br />
You tell a_warrior_01, 'I'm not going to revive you if you're in North Ro.  I'll let you walk for calling me an F'er<br />
<br />
a_warrior_01 tells you, 'F YOU!'<br />
<br />
/report a_warrior_01<br />
/petition<br />
<br />
UGHHHHH<br />
<br />
Some stupid powergamer wanted to be revived from one freaking zone away!  My goodness!  Not to mentoin he called me a F'er (not F'er, but f[insert u here]cker.<br />
<br />
I hope he gets his spanking.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">07-13-2000, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm...this warrior's attitude makes me wonder if he's even telling the truth about playing a cleric.  Most people I've come across who've actually played clerics to at least level 39 are really good people and are hesitant to bug other clerics for reses unless absolutely necessary.  Otherwise, you'll have to get used to other players telling you how to play your character, especially those of the twinked variety.  It's been my experience that every other non-cleric believes that they know how to play our class better than we do....yeah, as if!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone and their dog plead hopefully by say, or by tell, for buffs, heals and YES experience resses.<br />
<br />
Most accept gentle refusals with kicked puppy resignation, but some can get pretty foul about it ...<br />
<br />
May they all come back as clerics with the /anon /roleplay function deleted   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
And as to tellin' 'em to drag to you for a revive, I really had someone do that to me.  I told them they got NO exp for revive, they insisted they knew better, so I went ahead and did it, back in Rathe mountains at 29.  They got res effects, no exp, and learned that the cleric in question actually DID know what they are talkin' about.  Well worth the mana expenditure really.<br />

<br />
Seems like everyone has stories about people begging them, and wanting them to do stuff, and yelling at them.<br />
<br />
Umm, I've got two dedicated groups of people I play with, who always look me up when I'm online.  I've had people I just met earlier in the evening run to Sol A and get me a CGS.<br />
<br />
I had almost thought I ran into KS'ers last night (for the first time ever), but turns out they apologized when they found out we were camping the spawn, and even gave us post 50 buffs.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I've been 50 before, and 40 now on Torv, and I've never had a problem with beggars, ks'ers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiamme</div><div class="date">07-15-2000, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, first off this IS the rants board so it's where we go to vent   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif Not much point ventin' about how someone was really great and wonderful...<br />
<br />
And secondly, I play on Bristlebane which isn't an EVIL server, but is quite a populated one.  Folks all seem to be very savvy on what clerics can do, and aren't backward in requesting those services from complete strangers.<br />
<br />
I spent some time on Brell Serilis when it was fairly new, and found it on the whole much more civil than BBane - a lot of folks were trying to make it an 'unofficial' rp servers, seemed to make a difference.  And when I tried out a newbie zone on RZ, I fled screaming and realised that Bristlebane was in fact the height of good manners  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  I guess there really is variation between servers.<br />
