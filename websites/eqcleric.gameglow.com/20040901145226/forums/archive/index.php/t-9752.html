I have a bar of platinum in the Bank but do you think I can find a 39th level Enchanter on The Tribunal server during Australian Hours to enchant it, NOT BLOODY LIKELY, I have been trying for over a week now.<br />
<br />
I HATE CLERIC ARMOUR QUESTS !!!!!<br />
<br />
It's fine on the established servers to look for a high level Enchanter but there must only be a dozen or so Enchanters on Trib high enough level to help me  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

Does anyone know of a similar forum as this for Enchanters where I can T something up?<br />

<br />
A lot of them will ignore you if you don't state the purpose simply because they dont want to be sitting on their arse enchanting metal for other jewelry makers. But if you let them know that you need it for a quest, most will be happy to oblige.<br />

There just are very few Enchanters level 34 or better on The Tribunal  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

Thanks once more for your link to Casters Realm.  Thanks to that, I finally managed to get some plat enchanted and now have the boots.<br />
<br />
I was talking to another Cleric friend on Trib and some enchanters there are exploiting us badly, he /&quot;she&quot; had to pay 10pp per bar when he /&quot;she&quot;  finally found an enchanter who would help him/&quot;her&quot;. (hehehehe)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, a really cool DE enchater called Arulis saved my bacon. He even stayed logged on for an extra 20 mins so that I could get to him.<br />
<br />
Good to know there are nice people in the world      http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
I was the one with whom Domanic spoke regarding enchanted platinum bars. I know humans have poor night vision and the Temple of Solusek Ro is a bit dark, but I am a female halfling... *grins*<br />
<br />
So far I have found that most enchanters are willing to do the bars provided you supply the bars. With a charisma of 50, it would cost me over 140pp per bar, so I prefer to purchase the enchanted bars directly from them. Their cost is 105, and I offer an additional 10 for their time (also ensures they will sell to me in the future).<br />
<br />
Important tip -- when you do a /wh all ench 34 50 don't contact the ones in guk or solusek... They are a bit busy and tend to be a bit grumpy... Look for ones in Felwithe or Neriak, they are likely doing jewelry and don't mind speaking with you.<br />

<br />
Sorry Thistle, it's the hairy toes, it's hard for my poor human mind to associate toe hairs and women. (Shudder)  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  Have rectified the problem.<br />
<br />
I have a 88 Chr (buffed) so with a Shammy friend buffing me I can pick plat up from the shop for about 108pp if my faction is good.<br />
<br />
From XP most enchanters I have met are nice people, it's the Druids that are the money hungry rip off merchants.<br />
