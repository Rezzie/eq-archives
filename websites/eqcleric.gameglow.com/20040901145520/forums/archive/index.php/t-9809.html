<br />
Thursday Night<br />
Say goodbye, quit the guild, chat to my friend on the phone for 2 hours psyching myself up to be strong, have a restless night unable to sleep thinking “what have done”.<br />
<br />
Friday<br />
Have a lousy day at work, keep thinking of EQ, go out Friday night on a river cruise, dance, party on, meet some really nice people and have a lot of fun, “what was EQ again?”, sleep like a baby.<br />
<br />
Saturday<br />
The crunch hits, I want to log on, I stay busy in the house, play Star Trek - Birth of the Federation, go to a friends House warming party in the evening.  Phew, made it through the day.<br />
<br />
Sunday<br />
Even worse than Saturday, have to get away from the PC EQ is calling to me, I keep dialling into the net “to read my mail of course”, Call a friend and go out for a 2 hour lunch, watch “The Talented Mr Ripley”.  Gat back home about 7pm, win my game of BOF about 10pm.  Find I can’t sleep.<br />
<br />
Monday<br />
Really busy day at work, put a flaming post up on the guild message board in response to something an EQ friend put up (yes I am really hurting by this time). Finish a 2nd game of BOF (so over that game now). Once again, bad nights sleep.<br />
<br />
Tuesday<br />
Read the Guild message board, get into a huge argument with two rather obnoxious guild members who have responded to my Monday post, manage to annoy a lot of people in the guild and burn many bridges.  Take my flatmate out to Dinner, play Mechwarrior III.  Sleep surprisingly well.<br />
<br />
Wednesday<br />
Get stuck in to work, ignore EQ, that night log on tell my friends (the ones that would still talk to me) that I’m selling my account.  Some are really sorry to see me go some (after the message board affair) are happy to see me go.  RL Friends come over, I play Magic the Gathering all night.  Find once more that I can’t sleep.<br />
<br />
Thursday<br />
Start getting into my work, take a pause to get myself together, decide to post this rant to get my head around things.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What can I say, EQ had become such a large part of my life, about 170 hours a month, 35 days on Dom and a score of other secondary classes tried and played with.  To go cold turkey is really hard, I miss my VR friends, I miss the game.  When I first started playing EQ I was lucky to play 2 nights a week, slowly other things in my life slipped to maximise my EQ time to 6 nights a week and almost all the weekend.<br />
<br />
First to go was Gym,<br />
Then weekend activities like hitting the Beach or Bushwalking<br />
Video Rentals and the movies<br />
Partys and nightlife<br />
The woman I was dating<br />
Food shopping, replaced with take away food<br />
House work, mowing the lawn etc<br />
My friends stated to slip<br />
I started missing sleep and getting sick more<br />
My work started to slip<br />
<br />
I finally decided to pull the plug, but it’s hard to give up something that has become your passion.  But when your passion threatens to consume your life, it’s time to slap yourself around the head and get a grip on reality.<br />
<br />
Two of my friends are heavily into EQ, I pulled them in with me, I only hope they don’t also slip over the line like I did, letting a game become an obsession.<br />
<br />
It will take time to get my old life back, find the time to pull my friends back in and get out there living an active life again, until that happens the lure of EQ is just so strong.  <br />
<br />
I always thought that if I could get away from the game for a month or so, I could go back to playing a couple of nights a week again.  However, I feel now, like any addiction, It would be much better for me, that I stay away once I get over it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, that’s my rant.<br />
<br />
Now if I could only give up Chocolate  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I am an EQholic and a chocoholic!!!  If u must leave our Virtual Realm, then it is a must.  BUT, DO NOT GIVE UP CHOCOLATE!!!!!!! For your sanity u must at least have that one!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabbus</div><div class="date">03-04-2000, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure why you quit Domanic, but what you described is exactly why there is so many hate and flame posts by people about this game and Verant.  Having put so much time and money into this game being the motivation.<br />
<br />
Especially when a lot of the problems that cause people to quit are easily controllable by Verant.  Making it even worse.<br />
<br />
Verant can start out by lowering the meditation time by well over half.  There is no reason we should have to sit and stare at our monitor doing aboslutely nothing for 5 or 10 minutes, many times per hour.<br />
<br />
Then comes the severe death penatly, people do not care to waste their life away accomplishing nothing.  Having us lose 5 hours worth of game play over one death is insane.... which brings up the long spawn time in camping also.... the list goes on.<br />
<br />
I just wish more massive multiplayer RPG would come out to at least give EverCamp competition and force the EQ creators to listen to their customers or lose them.</div></div><hr />

Heh. Yeah, and they could give warriors the ability to heal at an equal rate, as well as solo effectively. (And if they did this I'd probably go back to playing mine almost exclusively, a group strong on warriors would be nearly godlike then.)<br />
I'm not against the idea, just tired of the incessant whining that goes on about meditation...there are worse things out there. (Guess that's my rant.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SolidSnke</div><div class="date">03-10-2000, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Domanic sorry to hear you go ... keep it up and you will be off EQ-Crack before you know it...<br />
<br />
I too went through your syptoms, of it consuming my life...<br />
<br />
one day i just up and deleted it and knowing I would have to reinstall and d/l all the patches again (then on a 56k modem), was enough for me to think twice about it.<br />
<br />
Now I am back... and I play alot but not as much as before and its really nice... it seems more relaxing and fun to play.<br />
<br />
Before it was kill ... look at exp ... kill ... look at exp ... now I would be lucky if i looked at my exp for a whole entire level or two...<br />
<br />
Anyways goodluck and maybe you will come back and play occasionally.<br />
<br />

                Find a lot of bad guys! Because the bad guys want to give you all their loot - otherwise why would they keep coming back ;) Just remember to stand BEHIND the warrior!</div></div><hr />

Dump it and don't look back. I know EQ was causing problems with my wife and I and we have it worked out now. I have days that I play, and those days are set aside. I know I play those days and not others, so we can spend time together, do housework, etc. She understands that it's a hobby not just a game, and my time on it is important, so she doesn't encroach on it.<br />
<br />
If you can't strike a balance between RL and EQ, please opt for RL.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Dom, you have alot of courage to pull the plug on EQ.  I am addicted, but have different reasons for playing this game.<br />
<br />
I am addicted to meeting my EQ friends and talk for hours about this and that, and have fun exploring together.  I have never met these people before, yet I find myself very comfortable with them.  I used to be playing EQ to LVL and accumulate wealth.  Now, it is for the social interaction that I lack in RL.  It is a negative sprial where, the more time away from RL friends, the more my in-game friends mean to me.<br />
<br />
EQ as a game, I could turn off.  The amazing people I meet nightly/daily, I can't.  On a positive note, I have found my soulmate.  Beyond her, EQ is nothing to me and would delete my chraracters and burn the game without a second thought.  Maybe I am not addicted, but crazy.  8)</div></div><hr />

I used to play EQ for relaxation and fun... but at times it causes more stress then my job.  I found as my charcter gets higher the stress gets bigger... when i was level 7 and die.. so what... now i found myself hiting the desk over and over again with my head.  I had a friend who actually broke up with his girlfriend because she would eat up on his EQ time.  Man I need help.... perhaps there should be some king of AA for EQ or a help line... in which case Verant should finance it.<br />
