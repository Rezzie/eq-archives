Your group should be higher, and the make up depends on their level.  Currently, my team is a 36 cleric (me!), 40 druid, 42 ranger, and 38 paladin.  We also have a more senior team nearby, so if we get in trouble they can take one.  However, the druid has evac if things go back and the senior team is not available.  An enchanter is nice for clarity, insight, speed buffs, etc.  Charming is also possible, depending on the skill and level of the enchanter.<br />
<br />
Seafury isle is west of Sister's Isle.  Seafuries are around level 40.  There is a named seafury, Quag Maelstrom, who should be avoided for the younger teams.  The senior team (around 48+) has no trouble with Quag.  Quag drains mana.<br />
<br />
You can pull to the abandoned druid ring, or sit near the Gornit(named pirate HG) spawn.  The second is nice, as you can alternate Gornit and seafuries.  Gornit drops plat and some junk.  Drops from Seafuries range from weapons to gems and jewelry.  Leo is averaging about 80 plat an hour.  <br />
<br />
Experience depends on the group as well.  When Leo has grouped with the more senior team, pulling was constant and he earned about 2 bubs of xp in level 36 for 3 hours.  With the junior team listed above, it was 3/4 bub for 2 hours.  <br />
<br />
Players have done this spawn up to level 54, and possibly higher.  <br />
