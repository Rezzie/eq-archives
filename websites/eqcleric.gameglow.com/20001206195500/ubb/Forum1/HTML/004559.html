</FONT><HR>Hello,<BR>  I am a level 20 halfling cleric, and I am looking for some advice.  I have had a good history of keeping my party alive, but lately I have been unable to stay alive myself.  Every time my party pulls three or more mobs, inevitably I will have most if not all of the mobs on me at some point in the battle.  <BR>  I have tried backing away; I have tried standing still.  With three mobs hitting me at once, it is hard to throw those heals on myself, and it often takes 2 or 3 tries to get Divine Aura off, if I live that long.  During this time, the tanks are furiously trying to taunt the mobs, and the rest of the party is trying to grab the mobs' attention.  Most of the time they have been unable to distract the mobs who always have a taste for halfling.<BR>  Can anyone give me some tips on how to handle situations like this?  This problem is a source of unending humor for my party, but it is becoming very frustrating.  I have been considering retiring my cleric because of this problem.  Can anyone help?<P>Thanks,<BR>Fhylden</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>My suggestion would be to try and root the mobs if at all possbile. Or even better would be to suggest less mobs per pull. If you are the only cleric in the group or healer for that matter, take control of the situation. If the puller is pulling too many let them know. Keep the qroup informed of you mana status. If you are not ready for a pull let the puller know (nobody likes a cowboy puller). <P>If you like the way he is pulling (2+ mobs per pull), get an enchanter. Mesmerise can be a life saver.<P><P>------------------<BR>Having no limitation. As limitation. Having no way.

</FONT><HR>Another thing to try (if you haven't already) is to wait longer to heal.  I know for a long time my instinct was to throw heals on the tanks as soon as they went down a couple of bubbles to keep everyone as close to full as possible.<P>Unfortunately, this means that you're throwing a heal fairly early in the fight before the tanks have time to get high up on the mobs hate list.  Once you heal, they all jump you as a consequence.<P>Practice letting the tanks get a little lower before you heal...not so low that they risk death, but there's no need to keep everyone at full during the fight.  Just alive.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Besides, it's good practice for later when you're tossing those cheals around.<P>Also, let the tanks know to begin taunting *all* the mobs as soon as they're pulled.  Have one of them taunt all of the pull before you heal.  This lessens the chance they'll jump you on your first cast.<P>Just some thoughts...good luck.<P>Minic Moonshadow <Salvation><BR>41 Cleric<BR>Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Mobs in different zones tend to react to healing differently too.<P>Lizards in Cazic always seemed to REALLY hate healing...Froggies in Guk hate it, but not as much as lizzies...and undead in Unrest seem to not care quite as much about it.<P>That was just from what I can remember way back when...I'd suggest trying different hunting grounds if it becomes too much of a problem</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Waiting longer on your heals is a great suggestion.  If you can't do that try to throw the heal early then cast Divine Aura.  Not only are you invunerable for 18 seconds, but DA works as an anti-taunt and will allow your tanks to get them off you.   <P>This trick works even better when you get Divine Barrier, then you have an anti taunt and an escape route.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Question, fhyld- what's your AC?<P>If you find that you're having problems with staying alive, I would highly suggest investing in better items AC-wise, even trading out some of your wis stuff.  Remember, at your level, 1wis=4mana, so those 6wis jasper rings only give you 24mana.  You can easily trade them out for 4ac 20hp 20mana ones, notice almost no difference in mana, and be much more surivivable.<P>At your level, AC is more important than WIS, IMO- I rode around with 130 or so with high AC and rarely had mana problems.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>If your group enjoys pulling multiple mobs and the group does not include an enchanter, have another caster (or hybrid) in your group root all the mobs before you need to throw your heals if you are being over-aggro'd.  This will allow you the ability to move around out of swing range so you can keep your party healthy, and when root breaks, the mob will usually aim for whoever rooted them rather than you - allowing you the ability to refresh that root and then heal the original one who rooted them.  By that time, usually at least one of the pulled mobs are dead.<P>Also, unless absolutely unavoidable, never heal before at least five seconds of melee combat has commenced when the pull arrives at the group.  If you throw a heal as your puller is running to the group, everything behind him will turn on you.  If he's one bubble from death, then it's unavoidable.  Once you are aggro'd, stop casting unless you simply can't avoid otherwise.  Casting is what aggro'd them in the first place, and continuing to cast will only make it harder to get their attention.  If you do get aggro'd, stand still so your tanks can remain in taunt range.  Nothing irritates a tank more than the need to chase their casters around.<P>Like Shaal said, also suggest only one pull at a time.  If you don't have an enchanter and the rest of your group won't assist with the crowd control, that may be your only option.  They'll gain experience much faster pulling single targets at a steady rate than pulling five, killing three before you die, running to the zone, then waiting 20 minutes while you recover your corpse.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Rooting and improved AC will help a great deal.  Early on, you will find that the luxury of having an enchanter is not always possible.  A good cleric will root the extra mobs on the way in so that the group can fight them one at a time.  I have adopted the habit of rooting the mobs twice in case the first root doesn't stick for long.  That way the group has longer to take down the first mob(s).  Good AC will allow you to get pounded on a while as you attempt to get your root to stick.  Remember you still have DA and can heal yourself after you successfully root the extra mob(s).  If you can train the puller to pause briefly before the mobs get to the group, or you go out and meet the mobs, you will have a better chance of getting root off a safe distance from the group.  Root=alteration.  A cleric's life blood is alteration since our heals require this skill.<P>On wisdom vs AC, if you have a good puller, you will rarely be FM.  The extra wisdom comes in to play only if you are FM.  Remember that.  I carry extra AC gear with me in a weight reducing bag and when I fall below FM, I start swapping out wis gear for AC gear.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Great posts everyone!  Together, you hit the nail right on the head!  This is what I advise in the absence of an enchanter.<P>1) Wait on heals (you can usually judge how quickly the tanks are losing life and time the heal accordingly).  Personally, I like to have the heal take effect somewhere in the 30-50% life range.  That means casting at the 40-60% life range. In a single mob situation, they'll never aggro on you if you do it like this.  Just tell your tanks what you're up to before hand.  I've never had a problem with it.<P>2) In a two MOB pull, if everone is assisting like they should, I behave like a single mob pull, just knowing that once the heal is off, the other will likely aggro me.  Stun and Root (auto attack always off), back off 10' and Heal or Med.  (I've been experimenting with Enstill, and in parking situations like this, it seems to hold them much longer)<P>3) 3+ Mobs requires a little more effort.  I try to park at least one before I need to toss out the first heal.  If you're outdoors, Fear those the mobs that your tanks aren't attacking.  That way members of your party wont be taking unnecessary hits from the additional mobs.  (Pay attention to your chat window for notice when your fear wears off)<P>4) If you're dying because you're puller is consistently overpulling, get a new puller or a new group.  Click your Divine Aura and get out of Dodge.<P>5) AC is underrated for clerics.  Since I put those Low/Non AC + Wis enhancing items in the bank in exchange for high AC items, I can take a couple mobs beating on me for a lot longer.  I find I can get spells off better while under siege.<P>6) Buff yourself first and fully with the AC/HP, HP, and AC line of buffs.  (Situation determines if you need the resists) When yours run out, AFTER you've rebuffed yourself, that will be your reminder to buff the rest of the party as mana permits.  <P>7) Call the shots in the group.  No one wants to die.  If you don't have enough mana to adequately heal or defend yourself and the others, don't let the puller pull.  If they refuse to listen, go back to step 4.<P>Basically, protect yourself first. Use spells, equiment and communication with your group members.  The groups job is to keep you alive.  As a member of the group, do your part to keep yourself alive.<P>Your job is to keep them alive.  You're not doing your job very well if you're a corpse.  <P>Like most good clerics I know, I take a party members death VERY personally, and I pride myself on going levels at a stretch without letting a member die on me (to include myself).<P>I'm not advocating cowardace or selfishness by any means.  Believe me, nothing irks me more than to see a cleric heal his own scratches while a tank is getting ripped apart... or to stand/sit idly while a caster is getting mauled... or nuke/melee themselves out of mana... or melee when out of mana... the list goes on....<P>Happy healing!<P>Copperleaf Windrider<BR>38th Cleric of Tunare<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I am curious as to the make up of your party.  If this is a regular group you group with, it would be very helpful to know the class and level of your group.  <P>If you are the only healer, then it is imperative that the tanks each take a mob and get it good and aggrod before you heal.  At 20, I had very little success with the root/park crowd control.  Channeling is not high enough and root is too unreliable.  Stun also tends to aggro mobs.<P>If you are not the only healer, have your druid or whatever standing by to cast heal on you.  The second heal will work to make the mobs easier to taunt.  That healer can heal you before you need it, just to keep you from getting pounded.<P>Having a Pally heal the puller on his way in is a great idea.  Pally's can take a lot of hits and that will instantly take all the extra's onto the Pally.  Rangers have great taunts, flame lick in particular, but snare is also a nice little taunt and has the benefit of leaving em snared.<P>At 20, I never healed the puller on the way in.  I always waited for at least five seconds to cast any heal.  Then I waited five more seconds to heal again.  Chain healing is one of the most effective taunts in the game.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>It also would be helpful to know where you are fighting.  If you are fighting some where and you lose a runner, or a Mob gets lost (which happens a lot in the snark for in Ill Omen), and then you heal the puller later, you might have a hate list problem.  If that happens, your entire party needs to zone or camp.  <P>Tarf Crackleberry<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I HATED levels 19-23.  This is because the healing spell you got at 14 just isn't effective and you pretty much have to chain heal just to keep tanks breathing.<P>This I believe is the source of your aggro problems.  You are casting heal because you have to and aquiring aggro in the process.<P>The only thing you can do is spread that aggro around.  Get a druid or shaman in every group and explain to them that its their job to heal you.  Both of these classes now have the same healing spell you do and should be helping a lot with the heals. Do not group without that secondary healer. Good news is at 24 you get greater healing and your taunt/healing ratio is greatly reduced.  I found that Gheal taunted the same amount as healing and was of course far more effective at healing.<P>Another option is to solo a little more at these levels.  At the entrance to Lake Rathetear is a nice little undead camp that you can use your new undead nuke one for great exp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>At least in your last case, it sounds like you have a bad case of transmitted hate. I spent levels 20-27 at the Sarnak fort in the Lake of Ill Omen, and I encountered the "Cleric-seeking homing Sarnak" phenomenon several times.<P>The Problem: In that zone of Kunark (and I am told most of Kunark shares this feature), monsters do not behave the same way as in similar-leveled zones in "Old" Norrath. In an outdoor zone an Antonica, if you attack something close to you in level, and have SoW, and run all the way across the zone, even though you have far outdistanced it it will continue to chase after you and will reach you if you stand in one place long enough. Because Kunark outdoor zones are HUGE, and to avoid trains, in at least the Lake of Ill Omen monsters do not do this. Monsters have a "pursuit range", typically a small amount farther than you could see them from at your farthest clipping plane. If you get outside their pursuit range, they stop following and go back to whatever they were doing before you made them mad. I am also told that the pursuit range can be much shorter in walled-in areas, due to loss of line of sight or something, but I have not personally tested this aspect. Anyway, be that as it may, if you get outside their pursuit range, they don't chase you, but they still remember you and hate you. If you get back into their pursuit range, they will immediatly begin pursuing again. In addition, any "social" monster will also pass their hate of you on to any social monster it passes. For instance, if you attack a Sarnak and run out of range with SoW, it will go back into the fort, and every Sarnak it passes will also hate you just as if you had also attacked them. This is all very reasonable and fairly logical, and makes for a lot easier escapes.<P>Now, here is the real problem for Clerics: casting a beneficial spell on a person the monster hates causes it to hate you too. So say a SoWed druid did the trick above with a Sarnak above and got the whole fort mad at him, and the comes to you on the other side of the zone and begs for healing. Even though you are nowhere NEAR the Sarnak, they can't possibly be aware you are healing their enemy, and though it makes no sense at all, every heal you cast makes EVERY sarnak that hates that druid hate you. Cast enough heals, and you will be VERY VERY high on that hate list. Then get an invis, walk into the middle of the Sarnak fort, and drop invis. Watch as every single close by Sarnak comes charging you immediatly and makes pulp out of you. Actually, I reallly DON'T suggest trying this. Aside from the dangers to life and limb, this phenomenon can get other groups really mad at you, because they will pull something, it will get into "pursuit range" of you, decide it hates you more, and come after you instead of following them. Most people just aren't very understanding when you swear it just ran to you for no reason you could see. <P>Symptoms of this problem: <BR>1. Your puller repeatedly loses some of his pull. Most pullers call the number incoming, and if the number that actually arrive are less, and you didn't see someone else take one or two, usually one got left out of pursuit range. Heals cast on the puller (or buffs) will put you on the hate list of the dropped pull, and anything else it runs across.<BR>2. Your puller repeatedly gets a huge number of extra mobs every time he pulls, usually mid-way through a pull. If he calls "Incoming Sarnak - 1", then a few seconds later you get, "Oh shoot, make that 4", and that happens several pulls, your puller is very likely hated by the Sarnak in there, and they are responding by coming to seek him out when he goes in to pull.<P>3. You get random faction messages. If another group is killing in the same area, eventually some of the ones that hate you will get killed. When they do, you get faction from them (anything on their hate list does). If you get more than one or two faction messages with no visible source (your group isn't killing monsters or questing), you are almost certainly on the hate lists of lots of things. Especially if the faction adjustments aren't the normal ones youd get for killing things.<P>4. The "homing missle" syndrome. If you repeatedly see monsters coming out of nowhere with your number stapled to their back and they barrel down on you without regard to the warriors and casters they just stepped on, you are DEFINITELY on a hate list.<P>Solutions:<BR>1. Do something to clear the hate lists. Zone, camp and come back, Feign Death (well, not as a Cleric), or get a high-level enchanter to memory blur everything in the zone...okay, maybe not. Camping to the character select screen and coming back is usually the fastest, but does break up your group. When you do this, also make your puller do the same, and anyone else that has cast buffs or heals on the puller. If in doubt, have EVERYONE do it. Otherwise the first heal you toss on the person still hated puts you right back on their lists.<P>2. Educate your puller. The Lake of Ill Omen is probably your puller's first experience with social monsters in a Kunark zone. Most don't understand why you don't want to get too far from your pull, as in previous cases it was generally good to get back with enough space to get ready. Most don't really understand the nature of the danger to Clerics (after all, the monsters only end up minorly hating the pullers, but MAJORLY hating the Cleric). Emphasize that they need to not lose pulls. Once they realize that they have to spend a minute camping and coming back and reorganizing every time they goof up, they usually get better.<P>3. Take more extreme measures. If your puller can't get the hang of it, suggest they do not use SoW, speed songs, or Snare. SoW is the #1 cause of lost monsters in my experience, as it is VERY easy to get out of range and lose your pull. This can be dangerous because some Sarnak (those near adherents) will have SoW speed, and will beat up on your non-SoWed puller. Still, if they can't pull with SoW on, its better than your whole group getting into situations it might not be able to handle. Another possibility is to get a monk to pull, and ask them to feign death immediatly before each pull (several times to make sure), and immediatly when they get back with the pull before engaging in combat(again, several times). Since feigning death generally makes everything forget the monk exists, once they stand up again you can the proceed to heal them with less trouble.<P>4. Find a different group or go somewhere else. Sarnaks are fun, look cool, die well, and are good experience and money for their level, but they aren't worth dying or always being in the risk of dying for. If you cannot get pulls without picking up hate, do something else. It's much safer.<P><BR>I encountered the homing missle pheomenon a whole lot at 24, when I first got G. Heal, and had a particularly bad couple of pullers. It is really not good at all. After casting 6 or 7 G. Heals on the puller, the monsters hated me so much that not only would they come for me as soon as they got anywhere close, they would also be absolutely untauntable. The group had to kill them to get them to stop hitting me.<BR>After 4 or 5 of these in a row, it was blind panic running for the zone for all concerned. This is NOT something you want to play around with as a Cleric. It cost me a couple of deaths. Not fun at all.<P>Ellowyna, Cleric of Tunare, 30 Seasons, of the Realm of Erollisi Marr.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>"Keeping the cleric alive" on a bad pull is simply one part of "keeping the group alive" on a big pull. Your group should have a "bad pull" plan in place that includes a big pull and/or the puller coming back near death.<P>Many tactics can work, but the group must do *something* to keep you safe. As secondary healer, I'll generally root if only one mob gets ahold of the cleric (or enchanter for that matter), and heal immediately if 2+ do (don't even wait to check the HP bar - just heal!).<P>BTW Ellowyna, I've had a lot of fun with transmitted hate with the Froggies in Trak's Teeth while hunting Hunters/Foragers. This hunt is characterized by nonstop pulling with the puller wantering around quite a bit, burning rubber when a rare pops. Once I heal/buff him a few times, I start getting the Amphibian Assault treatment. Just for laughs I tried to walk out of the zone after a couple hours of this - 20 secs later I was bounced by 3 of them. This can be a good thing with the right group and at the right level. Just make sure you have friends around<BR>to keep you alive.<P>Moona Midwinter<BR>Shaman, Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ellowyna is dead on about the snark fort.<P>I spent a lot of time there and the same thing happened to me.  The real problem is the adherents.  They stop to cast, and if your puller has a couple beating on him/her, they won't want to stop and make sure the adherent comes.  But the adherent won't come because it stopped to cast and gets lost.  It will then begin to broadcast hate.  When you start getting those random faction messages, everyone has to camp.  It is a pain, but if you don't, you will get swarmed at some point.  This is true of all the casters by the way, the adherents are just more common.  Since the casters have the best loot, you will want to get them pulled, but in order to get them pulled you have to wait for them to cast on you.  Hard to do.  <P>What you can do in the snark fort is go back into one of the rooms.  We made our home in the big room in the NW corner I think.  You can get back there by taking every right turn  until you get to the last xroads and go straight there.  It is a big room, frequently has a recruit or a revenant (big fun) or legionaire etc.  They don't havea  big aggro radius though, and we could invis back to the room, and start pullign the room, frequently we could kill a recruit with a revenant just standing around.  <P>It is much easier on the puller to go back there and have shorter pulls, it is more fun to be alone in a room in the dungeon than it is to pull to outside the fort, and you don't have the faction problems because of the short pulls.  If you can get back there invissed, you can have a great time.  If you can't get invissed, just fight your way back.<P>Your pally needs to be requested to use Flash of Light as a taunt if he/she is not already doing it.  It is a great taunt and will keep the Mobs on the Pally.  From your group make up, you can use your Pally to have sole responsiblity to get mobs off you while the warriors are demolishing the primary target.  Also your Pally can cast a heal on the puller making the extras get high on their aggro list. <P>The Snark fort is a blast, I would find a way to make it work for you, once you deal with the faction situation, your problems should disappear.  Consider strongly going into that room though, it is a really fun room to work out of and you will find it almost never camped and really easy to work out of.<P>Tarf Crackleberry<BR>Quellious Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, I just remembered you were level 20, that room might be a little high for level 20, but you have some fierce tanks, and it may be ok.  It might be easier to go into the first or second room from teh back door.  We still had problems with casters not coming with the puller from there, but it is still more fun to be in the fort than pulling to outside.  Another option with your group would be to send out two pullers.  Send out the pally and one of the warriors.  Have teh warrior aggro an adherent and recruit.  Have the pally throw a heal on the warrior, Pally then can bring recruit to the party and warrior can bring in the adherent.  Only one potential problem with this set up is that warrior can get rooted.  My experience with the snark fort was that it was quite possible to fight in the hallways etc.  Accordingly, the whole group can adventure around together.  In any event, my advice is to stay in the fort, there are nice and somewhat rare drops there and lots of exp and fun to be had.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, I assume you have ended up with two mobs that were pretty much unengaged when you threw a heal at a tank in need.<P>Problem 0: They weren't engaged at all.  Have a ranger fart at each mob a few times, and they shouldn't be as interested in you.  A warrior might have to click the taunt button to have the same effect.  If they get some good aggro before you need to heal, they aren't as likely to want you over the person next to them.<P>Problem 1: You have 2 (or more) monsters eating you, and they aren't leaving for any reason.<P>My solution:  Root Parking, advanced lesson for "multipull" terror<P>Try a quick stun (level 5, quick cast and easy to channel through with good timing) on one of them, then back up a bit.<P>Often by the time one is done being stunned (and it's a very quick cast) and you back up, the tanks can taunt it away much more easily.  One gone.  If you have another on you, then is the time to think about root parking the second, or stunning it as well and moving around the party to the other side, heal self (or tanks that need), and prepare to stun or root the angry mob(s) again.  I highly suggest root parking the extra ones you can isolate if you can channel through a hit or two.  The stun gets you some distance to get the root off, or to lessen the number of whacks you take as you cast the root.<P>This works even better if someone else can cast the root, but life isn't always so fair.  I end up having to do the rooting myself under pressure of extreme smackdownage more often than not.<P>Also, get that AC up, sacrifice wisdom at your level.  Wisdom makes very little difference until later on.<P>Another thought is that if you see three coming, the one in back might deserve a good rooting *before* he ever makes it to the party.  He's fine out there waiting out of meele range, unengaged and unloved.  Keep him there, and the mana you save will be worth the few castings of root.  Just keep him rooted, since he's coming for YOU when he breaks.  Oh, don't do this to a caster mob though, that just makes 'em do what they do best, exclusively to you.  Bad thing.<P>Well, it's kept me alive a lot of times.  If all else fails, there's DA and DB.  Use 'em, since if you die they need to do the 15 minute refresh anyways.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Stun/rooting, Root/Parking etc are all great cleric strategies but they aren't as effective at Fhyldens level. Hell even AC won't be as big of a help then.  Many of you are offering advice that would be great if he was level 30+ but he isn't.  Keep in mind his only healing spell is just that "healing" if a tank is getting pummeled he will have to chain cast it or loose the tank.  Now where is he gonna find time to root/park?<P>So I say it again...secondary healer secondary healer, secondary healer....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think we're going to disagree here.<P>"In My Humble Opinion" ...<BR>1) The stun spell came at level 5 and using it properly even at that level is every bit as valid as at level 44.<P>2) The root spell is effective at the level it is available too.<P>3) At that level I did not have to chain heal tanks much, since they didn't have that many hit points anyways.  If the team has one monster on them, and two come to me, then the tanks should not need chain healing.  If they do, then you aren't going to win that fight with 2 more mobs involved even if you had twice the mana.  Stunning one and rooting the other does *not* take very long, and considering the damage you're saving your tanks in both the short and long term, I would have to say that even at lower levels this tactic is quite valid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the above techniques and found them useful even at level 20 around the Sarnak fort. I was just attempting to redress a specific problem. One thing about Root parking though... it works well at 20, but not on Sarnaks. Most Sarnaks will be red and a very few yellows, and Root just tends to bounce right off of them or land for about 6 seconds and break. Once you get up to 24 or so you start to notice it actually landing once in a great while. Likewise Stun and Holy Might are questionable against red mobs because if they are resisted you essentially get no return. As far as chain healing goes, I didn't notice a particular problem needing to chain heal, even though Healing was a little weak. With a good group, and assuming the tanks are healed close to full between pulls, I found that I really didn't need to chain heal, just make sure I didn't let people go too far down without a heal. Actually, it was far more interesting pre-24 than post-24. At 24, G. Heal is amazing... but it takes more than a bubble of mana, and I was tending to cast it once every 2 minutes or so. There is nothing more boring than meditating for 2 minutes, tossing a heal, then meditating for 2 more minutes. I strongly recommend grouping with an enchanter. Even Breeze will give you enough mana to stay on top of buffs, heal, and still play with Stuns and damage spells a little for variety. <P>Ellowyna - 30 seasons in the service of Tunare in the realm of Erollisi Marr.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004559&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004559&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
