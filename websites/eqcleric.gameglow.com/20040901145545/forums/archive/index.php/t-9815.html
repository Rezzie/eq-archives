<br />
But that has to be the absolute WORST spot in the game to be. It brings out the worst in people (may also read &quot;the worst people&quot;).<br />
<br />
Me and Regis?<br />
Other Clerics 4 Me 0.<br />
<br />
The first time I arrived there committed to camping till Regis spawned there was no one else there. I ooc'ed every 15 minutes stating that I was camping Regis and leaving Zahal as he was kos to NPC's in zone and also a mob for an SK quest. After about 2 hours I get Zahal on Sense. I ooc that Zahal is out feel free to smack him; in hindsight a huge mistake, don't ever do this. I then was greeted with no less than 4 others that I could see popping in on me. One person says &quot;first one to cast on him gets the kill&quot;. I say &quot;That's not fair, I was here first&quot; but knowing that my stun will cast and hit faster than what the others were going to cast, thus they MAY give way. Anyway Zahal drops (killed by a person who said I could have Regis, quote &quot;I guess, but there's gonna be compitition&quot;. No problem. Regis pops, F8, 3. In one second Regis had made a quick move to his left and had already thrown a punch before being stunned. There was another cleric who had situated himself right next to Regis' spawn that I could not see (yes my stun did hit prior to any other spells) but was not there before me. Regis had aggroed on another person. I just sat there staring.<br />
<br />
Well, when I started to relize that Regis wasn't mine I decided to try to keep him stunned for the person who was killing him. Regis drops and he looted and took off faster than I could say &quot;holy dwarf&quot;. Actions of a person who knows he's guilty of a wrong doing IMO. Man was I mad. A few sarcastic tells later and I found out that the person who killed Zahal was the RL roomate of the cleric that got Regis, so what could I do there? Nothing. So I let it be and gave the cleric a final tell saying that all was peaceful and congratulations, still fumeing inside.<br />
<br />
On the next camp attempt there was already a cleric there waiting. Still upset from the mornings dissapointment I sit and hit camp. When the 10 second line comes up I hit camp again to cancel. I wasn't happy, and I wasn't going to get any better by camping, I would have just made myself more frustrated. So I figured I may as well try to find peace with this spot now or it will only get worse. I came to the conclusion that yes, I will get my bracers soon and that yes I will have Regis stolen from me in the process at some point in time.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with it. It's going to happen and there is nothing I can do about it so why let it get to me? Sure some of my time (which apparently is not worth as much as other's) to spend with my group is gone, but not for long. Besides I've caught them in level again and we all know that we group better with higher levels  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I've decided that if I get there and someone is already camping the spot (cleric or not, they were there first) then I go and find and kill Zahal, telling the person that was there first that I initiated the spawn and thusly give my blessings on the upcomming battle with Regis. Gate back, perhaps get another zombie skin to add to my collection, and congratulate them on their work. Besides, at least this way I still know the spawn time and can get 7 hours sleep.<br />
<br />
And yes I know that I said I would not kill Zahal as he was for another quest but if I ooc that Zahal is up then the Regis spawn becomes a circus so I don't do it. What is the drop for the quest? Troll Guts? If so then they and NOT no drop or lore so if anyone wants them just ask me, I'll give them away.<br />
<br />
Did the same thing yesterday in killing Zahal and again today. Only twist was that the person that was there before me today was the person from my first camp that was standing right next to Regis spawn when I was there first. Heheh, I gave him a tell<br />
- &quot;You were here first this time so do you know what I'm going to do?&quot;<br />
- &quot;What?'<br />
- &quot;Kill Zahal for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
That may, just may, be one person brought back from cerebral constipation that causes us to act the way we do sometimes in these situations. Maybe not. I don't care. I tried, I'm okay with my actions and that's all I really care about. If I start getting angry over the kill stealing and farming of Regis I'll only drive myself insane cause there's nothing I can do.<br />
<br />
Except what I'm doing. Showing respect for other's time, waiting in line, and maybe even helping.<br />
<br />
The spawn of Regis has no rules that I've seen. It's basically FFA and that's sickening. That damn spot brings out the worst in people.<br />
<br />
But I will get my bracers soon and I will do NOTHING which will make me regret the actions that I take to get them.<br />
