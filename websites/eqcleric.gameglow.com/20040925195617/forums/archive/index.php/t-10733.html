Donlan won't give exp. but McCluskey does even at 50. But they both have the corrupt Bracers that you turn into Captain Linarius in N. karana.<br />
 A bit slow yes, but you will get there.........eventually. heh heh<br />

Solo'd him all the way thru 49. Loot isn't too shabby with the shield that sells for almost 5pp. And lets not forget the damaged helmets that gain you a little exp too (not much, but 50 of em add up &lt;G&gt;). Just use the old root &amp; nuke. BTW, if Jendl is camped, try the open area on the E Free side of the E Free/W Free zone nearest the docks. There's a guard posted by the zone and Hazeran wanders there (he's a tough one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">07-24-2000, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's how I soloed through 49.<br />
<br />
At 49 (and 48 and to a lesser extent 47) you can pull singles from the Spec cave in the Feerot. The problem is that many of the spawns will be green to you, and it really slows the exp to have to clear them, so try to find a couple of lower level players that want to hunt specs. The tree spawn is so perma-camped that this is pretty easy to do. Then pull singles for them (I just feared them out of the cave).<br />
<br />
Presto, not only do you get the greens cleared (keeping the choice blue spawns for yourself), but you are a hero for pulling for the other people. If you're lucky, the people you're pulling for can cast SOW or clarity.<br />
<br />
And it's alot more fun than sitting there alone.<br />

<br />
He's level 49ish I think, not something you want agroing on you when you're in the middle of a fight with a spectre...<br />

It dries up a bit around 49, but you can still make lv 51 there.  You can pull all of them solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play on quellios and fairly often the exe<br />
camp (includes sage, savant, and cav) goes uncamped and I can hit all the ph's during th e 29min timer.  Almost all the ph's are exp and definately all the named are.  You can<br />
also hit the ass/sup and rit ph's as well if not camped you just have to move around.  As a matter of courtesy I always move on though if a full group wants to take over.  I think its rude when a single player camps a PH in a camp where there is decent exp pulling for a full group.<br />
<br />
But if its not busy you are hitting upwards of 5 placeholders/named per 30mins getting great exp and a very very decent load of loot.</div></div><hr />
