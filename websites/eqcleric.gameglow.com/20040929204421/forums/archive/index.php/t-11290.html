<br />
When I checked on responses on my equipment update thread, I got this: <br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; Best thing you can do to upgrade, make a drood...&gt;&gt; <br />
<br />
While reading a post from a person who wanted to start up a cleric and was asking for advice on starting stats there were plenty of posts telling him basically not to bother making a cleric. <br />
<br />
Even if the rest of you dont, I enjoy my cleric. I read this because I want to be a better cleric, and its insulting when I'm told I shouldn't bother. *sigh* <br />
<br />
It boggles me why fellow clerics are discouraging people from playing clerics.. why would one bother playing a cleric if that was the case?&quot;<br />

ARE YOU ALL CRAZY DOOMED?!! GO PLAY THEY NEED MORE CLERICS IN SEBILIS, CHARDOCK, HS, Velks... NEED I SAY MORE!!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you very much need to say more.<br />
<br />
When/ if the Druid and Shaman healing changes go into effect, and those classes become superior choices for groups (as many clerics feel will occur)... THAT is what the complaints and concerns are about.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croff</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know why we tell people not to make clerics?  <br />
<br />
1.) We hear that Complete Heal spell won't work in the new PoP expansion. In some zone of PoP at least.<br />
<br />
2.) With the new spells that other classes are getting, there will be no use for clerics in exp groups.<br />
<br />
3.) I know in my guild alone, we have at least 5 cleric alts with epics. So the whole reasoning of you will need a cleric there to res people is out the window  when you can keep 2 alts on to res   and one camped incase of wipeout. <br />
<br />
4.) When I made my cleric a long time ago, I already had a 45 warrior. Even pre-Kunark you could tell that clerics were a very important class. So I have seen alot of people(myself included) start up clerics because we were needed. Now with most big guilds needing about 10 of thier 60 raid force clerics(thats an abstract figure), it seems that with all the changes  there will be ALOT of clerics out there  who have nothing to do after raids  due to not being usefull in a group  and not being able to solo.<br />
Shamans will get the groups, and no mobs will be up due to Druids quid kiting all the mobs that are easy enough for a cleric to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystifaere</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure all of you like me have invested countless hours standing behind other players healing/rezzing/ and medding. Keeping the groups alive and kicking...and spending every last plat on peridots to keep the buffs on your fighting groups.<br />
Part of me does feel &quot;betrayed&quot; to a degree if a version of CH goes to other classes like 90% rez did to pallies, but I don't think these things will stop me from being me and playing a cleric in my days in EQ. I can spend my time worrying about whether I will be groupable or not and who will be taking my glory, or I can see where I fit in and just enjoy my online time. I know this is a sensitive issue with some and maybe I am being too optomistic, but I still feel strongly that the Cleric class will NEVER die off and that eventually VI will get it right and fix us up properly. - Now the question is when. LOL IMHO.<br />
<br />
I sure hope they dont name any more spells after fruits and vegetables....Oh yeah!! thats the dr00ds. NM:D <br />

Cleric for life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nottall</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been playing my cleric for 3 years now.  The only time I really enjoy the game is when the &quot;oh SH_T&quot; factor sets in and challenges me.  For instance last night I had the task of healing to main tanks in ToV, not one but two, while fighting two AE mobs at the same time.  I was forced to run up and down the hall to get within range to heal one or the other as well as run back to a room where a mod rod was waiting for me.<br />
<br />
If it wasn't for moments like this I would quit playing my &quot;1 demnsional&quot; class.  VI made a great jump with the &quot;improvements&quot; they made then took them away.  So Once again I am back waiting for the &quot;oh SH_T&quot; factor to kick in for some fun.</div></div><hr />
