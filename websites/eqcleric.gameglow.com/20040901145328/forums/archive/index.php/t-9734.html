Like most in their teens/twenties who value wisdom, I decided to recover the fabled Testament of Vanear. I do not camp things, so whenever I pass through Highhold I check on the corrupt guard to get the final missing page. The four times I have seen him, there was a line of wolf-formed druids waiting to pounce upon him. So be it.<br />
<br />
This past weekend, however, the server was down due to a power outage. I logged on with fewer than forty people in all of Norrath, and woke up in Rivervale. This was my chance! Cloaking myself from undead eyes, I ran through Kithicor and dragged several orcs to the guards in Highpass Hold. A quick swim and I was standing before Dyllin himself, with no other players in the zone.<br />
<br />
Although he conned green to me, I had heard that the other smugglers would come to his aid. So I buffed up and followed him a bit until he was apart from the others. A quick smite, and I started swinging.<br />
<br />
Then I see another cleric run into the smugglers cave from outside. I greeted him, and was shocked to see him cast twice against Dyllin. A few more thumps of my mace and he was dead, but I was unable to loot the corpse.<br />
<br />
I was as mad as I have ever been in my clerical career. When I asked if he had seen me fighting Dyllin, his only reply was &quot;Sorry, I need the page as well.&quot; The priest was anonymous, so I did not see his level, but he conned red to me, and was wearing a Bloodstained Tunic and carrying a Crested Mistmoore shield.<br />
<br />
Kill stealed by another cleric -- Grrrrr!<br />

If someone KS's me intentionally like that, they go on my ignore list. And people on my ignore list get no assistance from me later on. I'll gleefully stand and watch someone die who KS'd me a few days earlier. I also don't group with those folks. I don't care if it's a camp for an item worth 2000p and I'm guaranteed the first one... I won't take the chance that they won't do something dishonorable while grouped with me.<br />
Can't wait til some of these clowns get up close to lev 50 and find out just how much you need friends who trust you and who you can trust. Remember his name... I promise he'll be tellin ya for a resurrection some day in POH. &quot;Sure buddy... today's KSr rate for a Res is 500pp, payable in advance&quot;  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

Well, the server was Tribunal (my home) but I do not exactly recall his name and would hate to besmirch someone by mis-remembering. My vision was a bit clouded by the blood boiling in my eyes...<br />
<br />
On a KS-related note, my guild leader was in a group in Mistmoore that included a druid (a fellow halfling, I am ashamed to admit) who turned out to be a kill-stealer of no remorse. A shield-bearing ghoul was pulled out by a second group, and this druid opened up the heavens on him. My guild leader apologized profusely to the pulling group, and told them they could have the shield. The druid stepped up and looted, and kept the shield instead.<br />
<br />
I was passing through King Xorbb's gorge the next day, and noticed the druid stalking Evil Eyes. So I auctioned &quot;WTB Mistmoore Shield&quot;, immeadiatly got a &quot;How much?&quot; from him on the auction channel, and replied with &quot;From you, free you thieving ruffian!&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire zone heckled him until he left...<br />
