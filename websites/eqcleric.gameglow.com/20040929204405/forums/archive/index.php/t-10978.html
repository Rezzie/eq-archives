I have no idea about what to expect, what not to do or any of that. Anybody thats been and can warn me. (I am 1 orange into 49 BTW, trying to get 2 oranges in). How do I get there? Will I need help? Will I need invis pots?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) Probably<br />
<br />
3) Nah, if you're going to be the only Cleric then I see no reason why someone can't be your invis slave.<br />
<br />
4) Assist heal, that's all you can do in that situation.</div></div><hr />

Follow the zone wall to the right past akheva to the UP zone. Before you go in, if the mobs guarding the entrance havent been killed, da and run in. You don't want to take the harmtouches there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikeren</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, now I am not only scared, I am trapped :-(<br />
<br />
I blew my last Potion of Invisiblilty (not cloudy potions, those are ugly)<br />
<br />
I am now there. The cave, which has the zoneline has swarms of red KoS non-see through invis mobs. I bound myself there. Now, I cannot get through the mobs on one side, and on the other I am basically a corpse walking. So I gotta sit tight for the raid.<br />
<br />
Yes, I checked out loot, and all that.<br />
Thanks, and if your on AB we could use a epic cleric with time to rez our raid force. Lets see, raid starts at 18:00 GMT, will get going around 20:00 GMT, and should be whiped by 20:02 GMT</div></div><hr />
