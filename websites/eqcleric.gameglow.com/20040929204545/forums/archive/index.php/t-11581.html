<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noken</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was going to put this as a reply in the general forum, but decided it may deserve it's own, and I don't want to offend either community - so I hope it wont here.<br />
<br />
Here's how the latest patch effected level 60 druids:<br />
<br />
1) Quad kiting requires mobs with less than about 8k hp to be effective, that means they are generally at or less than level 50.  The new patch will hurt quad kiting badly then because of the new exp model in mobs - meaning given the increased risk over root doting it is now widely considered after this patch to be ineffective.  Our AE at range (fist of karana) was also nerfed to LoS only in this patch - it wasn't before.  And as allready stated most druids (myself included) don't quad. <br />
<br />
2) Most (again level 60) druids chose to use epic dot + drones of doom (from bracer / arms) and 1 of winged death, or breath or Ro.  Thought about 95% use WD because of resist and fizzle rates.  The reason we don't use more is without some nice FT items and KEI it makes a net loss in mana.  Also consider that our best (and most used because of it) root costs 75 mana. <br />
<br />
3) healing, yeah obviously we didn't get it.<br />
<br />
4) last druid related thing they did in the patch was change the epic by removing the snare component (which all but the uber crowd who is less concerned about resists consider a nerf)  The reason our epic dot lasts 3 mins and 10 seconds to cast is because of that snare component (which they can't make seperate)... did they adjust those 2 components to make us even with necro's and shaman epic dot? No.<br />
__________________________________________________<br />
<br />
I'm not a cleric and so I'll leave the patch info open to you to define how it effected you, but I would suggest that clerics got some MAJOR incresaes in this patch, and believe druids, no matter how you role the dice, got nerfed.<br />
<br />
An agreeable thing said may times on the druids grove is:<br />
&quot;All priests should offer a similar level of value in solo, group, and raid situations, and they won't be considered balanced until this is true.&quot; Rich Waters<br />
<br />
As it stands clerics and shamans are WAY ahead on raids, WAY ahead in grouping, and solo clerics are ~almost even to druids now, and shamans are ahead of both (who else can solo CT?)<br />
<br />
So please, tell me, as a cleric, why you would envy / despise druids in these 3 areas - solo, group, and raids - after this patch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok here is a minor comparison of the classes;<br />
<br />
Cleric are superior in;<br />
Healing<br />
Buffing<br />
Regaining XP loss<br />
Meleeing(as of this patch)<br />
And generally have more AC &amp; HP then druids.<br />
<br />
Druids are superior in;<br />
Travelling (Levi, sow, porting, invis)<br />
Spell damage (nukes and Dots)<br />
Utility spells(DS,snare, etc)<br />
<br />
Clerics do not have the wide area of abilites that druids have, and Druids do not have the tight focus of abilities that clerics have.<br />
<br />
Sure we are both priest classes, but with lot of differences.<br />
<br />
Yes we got a major upgrade(The biggest since i have seen since i started playing my cleric almost 2 years ago)  But ye must consider that cleric  have been beaten by the nerfstick very often also(MOK, velious bp´s, epic) and also have been ignored by VI.<br />
<br />
I dont feel inferior or superior to the druids in anyway.  because we are different.  Same with shamans(though im never gonna be able to solo a dragon like shamans can) :)<br />
<br />
About clerical soloing ability,  only thing i can solo efficiantly(to some extent) are undead mobs, and they arent in many zones and we have problems taking on more one mob at time.  We cant kite, we cant take on 4 mobs without huge problems.<br />
And i dont solo for xp, i usually solo when doing quests, or just relaxing from raiding.<br />
<br />
About Clerical grouping ability.<br />
When xping i want it to be with a group.  Here our buffs and heals help alot.  I have always used nukes and meleed in groups when I am able(with more then 80% mana) since i started this char.  I dont want to sit on my arse unless i have to.  I can do mini crowd contraol when i have to(with roots and stuns).  And of course the superior healing power makes the hardest xp places possible, but hey, thats what the cleric class is all about...healing.<br />
<br />
About clerical raiding ability.<br />
Here we shine, without a cleric there is no raid.  But believe me, this pressure is a curse also.  <br />
<br />
But this &quot;balancing period &quot; isnt over yet, so it is really futile to nail this all down now.<br />
Therefor im gonna wait until its over and bring more comments on this.<br />
<br />
But one last thing, I would like to say that the druids in my guild are very valuable to us clerics, they are our backup healers, and often keep us alive while we are busy keeping MT´s alive.  So if they get more healing power, hell i will be glad.  <br />
And without them we would have problems mobolizing to the place of raiding.  Hell without druids my guild would have some serious problems.<br />
<br />
uh sorry about this rambling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well to tell you the truth before we all jump on the &quot;unfair treatment to druids bus&quot; I do belive that caster balancing isnt finished and the presume it is taking a big leap of faith.<br />
<br />
<br />
That been said I dont feel envy I dont feel despise Im rather indifferent to the whole subject call it apathy if you wish.<br />
<br />
Personally not taking into to account soloers/quaders (this coming from a old school necro here) the fact that harder mobs give better exp just make's sense.<br />
<br />
Should killing one level 60 mob in Sanctus Seru (inset zone name you hunt here as I mentione Sanctus due to killing mobs in that zone for the reports for a quest) give the same exp as giving some gimp level 47ish spider in velks?<br />

<br />
I like the difference to classes, all being the same is boring.<br />
And who would turn a well played druid down?<br />
<br />
All this talk about maxxing dps in a group is driving me nuts and smells like elitist talk to me.<br />
<br />
What I really like about this update is I can now do CR for my friends in places like Permafrost, LGuk and SolB without having to worry too much about invis (live side Guk) or going oom.<br />
<br />
<br />
And get that druid fix on live servers!!!<br />
That would mean druid and cleric could make a nice combo for xp'ing. Tanking cleric and druids could just do their stuff and med while we melee :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noken</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, I'm really quite suprised at your responses :)<br />
<br />
Tis true balancing isn't over, however I have been posting on the grove for many years and have lately seen some nasty clerics appear there and flame us.  so I came here, naturally, and saw suggestions on how to nerf druids and how there's some sorta envy - I really just want to know why.  I am of course refering to why some site druids as the people you want to solo like, suggest we shouldn't have invis and you should, and some sorta thing saying druids should only be 75% as good at anything as a cleric.<br />
<br />
I'll wait and see what happens with balancing, but I do want the clerics out there who feel differently than you to know what they are talking about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chronomis</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should killing one level 60 mob in Sanctus Seru (inset zone name you hunt here as I mentione Sanctus due to killing mobs in that zone for the reports for a quest) give the same exp as giving some gimp level 47ish spider in velks?<br />
<br />
Level 60 mobs already gave more experience than level 47 mobs.<br />
<br />
Using the widely accepted formula Experience = (Level ^ 2) * ZoneSpecificConstant, a 47 mob in the same zone as a 60 mob would only yield 61% as much experience.  Of course, comparing a mob in Velk's to a mob in SSeru throws a wrench into the works.<br />
<br />
What the patch did was increase the spread by giving a bonus at the high end and a penalty at the low end.  Increasing risk vs. reward is perhaps appropriate, but there are some definite downsides, especially for casual players and people still climbing up to level 60.  The changes also increased the value of efficient healing in experience groups, and since clerics still have a monopoly in that arena, clerics received a net boost at the expense of other healers.</div></div><hr />

/sigh <br />
I didnt know that clerics were going to the druid grove to whine and rant, thats bad.<br />
<br />
I read other class forums occasionally, mostly to get info and learn about other classes.   And i see people go between forums just trying to kick some dust up.<br />
Those people are just trying to get attention, nothing else.<br />
this Sam guy who appeared on this forum jsut before the patch is a fine example.<br />
Just ignore the flamemakers and then people can do some serious discussions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kawphy</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright first thing we have to remember is that we're all different classes, as stated before.  The ideas and concepts behind all the classes are different.  A SK and a Palladin are two different things, a combination between a warrior and necro/cleric.  So it should seem that they should have different abililties, one has LoH, and another has HT.  The same goes for the other classes.  Mage, Wizard should no have the same spells, or skills.  Same goes for the three priest classes.  We should not have all the same spells and abililties.  Druids have ports, nukes, dots, snare, sow, etc. Shamen have slow, sow, dots, stat buffs, etc.  Clerics have rezzes, hp buffs, undeads nukes/dots.  Now all three of the classes also have heals.  It would make sense that all 3 have similar heals, but not the same.  We just need to wait and see what happens to all the balancing.<br />
<br />
As to your comment about clerics coming to your boards and flaming, there are people in every group and class that will do that.  As stated on your boards(and many others), the opinions of those people DO NOT represent the whole.<br />
<br />
To everyone  : I think the best thing for us to do right now, is not accuse flame each other, and not to point fingers at one class or another.  We do not decide what changes happen and to whom they happen to. We should just wait and see what is to come.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystifaere</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sure hope the cross posting/flames would stop. Frankly VI decides what classes get what spells, and to what extent those spells work or don't. Not the druids and Not the clerics, nor any other class of character for that matter.<br />
<br />
Right now clerics are scrambling due to a perception. The same perception that druids have had for the longest time. We are worried that if another class gets a heal/spell similar to our own CH, that Clerics will somehow become undesirable or ungroupable, or worthless for raids. I personally dont think the cleric class will go away. I think the other priest classes should have a better heal - maybe 1k HP's or so, but that would be where I would draw the line. IMHO.<br />
<br />
In the end VI will do what VI will do, and as with all of their policies, we will all &quot;just have to live with it&quot; :( <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noken</div><div class="date">09-05-2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed with the cross forum flamers.  I was hoping to attract one here thought, where I invite them to justify what they've said.<br />
<br />
Anyway, druids allready have a heal near 1000.  I think it's 927 for 400 mana, but to be honest it's nothing like CH.  I've been on many raids healing tanks and when they have 7k hp it doesn't take long to see we can spend upwards of 2k mana to heal them.  I'll let you fill in the blank on how much a cleric would spend.<br />
<br />
We shall see though - maybe I'll post here again when balancing is more finalized, otherwise this thread might as well end.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
Seeing as you've only had 4 posts here, and 3 of the 4 were in this thread, could you please elaborate on how the responses to you here were as simplistic and demeaning as you say people gave you?  I invite you to search for the word complaining in this thread besides this quote here.  Found none?  <br />
<br />
This is pretty confusing to me as there were a lot of positive parts about druids here, and even you said yourself Originally posted by Noken:<br />
&quot;Wow, I'm really quite surprised at your responses :) &quot;   So why such a different tone when posting in druids grove?<br />
<br />
I must say, I'm quite dissapointed by this =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">caudex</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason is what it comes down to.  We are &quot;needed&quot; to heal a high hp main assist.  Thats it, thats what we have to be there for.  Other classes do need heals too.  If druids were not trying to heal a 7k  hp tank with a 1k heal (like thats not a very narrow and specific example) and were in fact healing at 75% of my efficiency why play a cleric?  I have plenty of mana left during most fights, if I dont thats what mana feeds and mod rods are for.  Resing and symbol are nifty but I wouldnt say they stack up real well against the rest of the druid attributes.  I suppose its something to stack with potg since thats better than aego in most groups unless you are using a cleric self buff.  I havent the foggiest idea why they finally decided we should be able to kill a green live mob without burning a whole a mana bar.  Its nice but its mainly a novelty.  The new heals make sense to me.  Now we can spot heal 75% better than a druid instead of essentially the same maybe.  To me the classes that are kind of sucking wind are mage(hi nuker that cant do the spell damage of a priest), sk, and possibly warrior.  I'd have preferred it if theyd left us all alone on the rest of it.  Druids are supposed to be a jack of all trades class to me.  That means they can fill in multiple spots, they can.  They arent as good as the specialists anymore than a paladin can out heal me or I can outmelee(yes that includes damage mitigation) a paladin and that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I have a 57 Shaman, 56 Cleric and a 52 Druid. I play 2 at a times quite often and find the Shaman/Cleric combo in a group is unbelievable, combination of slow and dots makes cleric healing much more efficient. I hope they increasing the healing power of both classes I have a hot key setup to just heal me in those omg I am gonna die situations. I mainly use my druid as a utility char to taxi around my cleric and have just recently started including him in my groups to move him along, I think a previous poster said it best, they all have there places and a good druid and/or a good shaman will always be welcome in any of my groups. But a bad one of either class will cause everyone much trouble. I have been in groups that looked on paper like a disaster but everyone did their part well and we did well in return.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's not that we dont like them, but rather that if we're put into competition with the treehugging hordes (and the smelly shaman) for EXP groups, there needs to be some reason in some circumstances where a cleric is preferred to a druid, or at least as attractive.<br />
<br />
It was the considered option of many (though not all here) that where we WERE headed was into definate 3rd position.  If (or when) those new heals go active, the recent changes (combat- such as it is, and tough-mob EXP bonus) should help to make the cleric competitive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woundless</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How many players especially squishy casters who die more regurally want a group without an exp rezzer. And if druids and shaman came to replace us in groups, how many fold do you think what we charge for rezzes out of our groups will go up. I for one know if I am shunned from a group in exchange for another healing class they better not come to me for a rez or at least haul a ton of plat with them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">09-21-2002, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">has played 38 levels of being rejected for groups because a druid offers so much more to a group when the cleric lacks Complete Healing.<br />
<br />
Every cleric alive has been killed by greens because she couldn't self-invis, while the druid with Improved Superior Camo waltzes safely wherever they want to go.<br />
<br />
Every cleric alive has been trained by a quadding druid and then flamed by said druid for alleged KS'ing.<br />
<br />
Most clerics (but probably not all of them) are jealous about quad kiting.  Druids say it's no big deal and it's not good exp anyway, and then you read these posts by druids saying `Why is grouping such slow xp ?` and you see all these druids with about 10 days /played at level 55 and you think, `Yeah right.`<br />
<br />
Every cleric alive has spent 50 levels trying to get from place to place using SoW potions, Invis potions and buying ports (from druids).<br />
<br />
Sure, I'm 60 now and I have a faithstone (which I couldn't make myself, I had to buy it from someone who could forage, and guess which class they were ?) and my Overthere gate hammer (which procs at 51) and Thurg gate potions (when my Thurg faction is high enough to use them).  I have a Larrikans Mask and a pile of invis potions on me and a horse.  Want to know how jealous I am of the ease and convenience of playing a druid ?<br />
<br />
How many spells do you think clerics have access to compared to druids ?  Once you've added those up, how many of the cleric spells would you say are nerfed into uselessness ?  (Hint:  Never mind Mark of Karn, I'd be happy if the Lull line actually did something... even if it was restricted to undead only.)<br />
<br />
Druids have similar issues with clerics, I do understand that.<br />
<br />
The choice between the classes is that druids sacrifice power for versatility, while clerics sacrifice versatility for power.  Druids are jealous of the power of the cleric class, and fail to appreciate the extent to which that power is situational (read:-  high end xp groups and raids only) and the helplessness of the solo cleric to do basic things like kill greens for quests or tradeskills.  Clerics are jealous of the versatility of the druid class, and we see that druids are allowed to work on their own quests and projects while we are instructed by our guilds in no uncertain terms to come and spend another four hours raiding for no prospect of loot or xp.<br />
<br />
We see that our lives at 60 consist of counting to five and then pressing the CH hotkey again, and we compare that life to the life of a druid, and yeah, personally I get pretty damn jealous.</div></div><hr />

Everything and anything can be done without a cleric, more efficiently, for better experience (talking about experience groups, not raids) hence the retarded ideas which came about from the development team to try and 'balance,' clerics. Which in non-retard speak means try to make it so clerics scale to exp groups, thus becoming a worthy addition and not a waste of space.</div></div><hr />
