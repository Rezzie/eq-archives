We are more than just a raiding guild we are a community and seek out players with personality not just those in search of the next big kill. We do raid 3 days a week from 7pm -11pm EST. We are looking for all classes as we are about to enter NToV and looking to increase our member base. We dont have raid points and the only thing we ask of our members is to be ready for Call to Arms 3 days a week. We do more than raid we group together and we have guild events such as guild pvp tournaments.
