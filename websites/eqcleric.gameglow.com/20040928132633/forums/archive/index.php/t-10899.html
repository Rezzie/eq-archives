<br />
Best healing tactics(how many clerics for main tank).<br />
How many people does this raid require? Roughly how many tanks?<br />
Best place to pull Dozekar to avoid ae's?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
As with any other mob in the game who has AE, you want to hide from it if possible.  It's really simple to get him to the doors to his room.<br />
<br />
Group CH is golden vs. Doze.<br />
<br />
Another guild on our server (Star) did him with 26 people and only 1 DB wiz.<br />

The key factor to Dozekar is your aggro control. The main tank MUST have aggro the entire fight. If he/she doesn't, the other melee will start dying, and you won't have the damage output to counter his insane regen. Dot/debuff him up, just like you do for statue. Have your casters avoid the AE; there are several spots to do it near/in his room. You should be able to find them without too much trouble. Have a few clerics (2-3) spacing cheals on the main tank; I'll leave you to figure out how to time the heals. Have other clerics maintain their tank groups, and just keep up the damage until he dies. It's a six-seven minute fight.<br />
