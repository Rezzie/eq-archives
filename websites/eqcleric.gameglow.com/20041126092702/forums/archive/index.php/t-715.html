As usual I was looky for my favorit chromed fiend to lay some wrath on.<br />
<br />
Whats that? A Chromy standing by the lake? hehehe Let the fun begin. My little party charges up to be greeted by Simon (somthingoranother) a priest of Mithaniel Marr sent here to do a {Funeral Procedure}. Well I cant get him to talk at all besides his Hail responce.<br />
<br />
So I am hoping this is new, and possibly the start of a Diety item for Mithaniel Marr followers and I am hoping any of you have some answers as to how to get him started.<br />

SE side of the lake, Near the barbarian hut. Hes able to Dual wield Swords, and wear Paladin Ro Armor and is Red (and Amiable) at lvl 41.<br />

Good thing I didn't try and whoop his arse eh http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif red to a 41 hahahah I woulda got smoked in 3 hits http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, forget trying to waste him.  Also avoid dueling near him... I saw a screenshot somewhere where he'd taken exception to a couple of duelists - he hits for over 500 a pop.  Ouch.<br />
<br />
And the paladin spell is Divine Might, not Holy Might.  Just to be picky  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
