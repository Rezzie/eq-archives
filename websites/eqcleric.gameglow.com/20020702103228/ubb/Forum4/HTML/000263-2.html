</FONT><HR>ok just so not all the stories are bad =)<P>I had just started playing, when my wife wanted me to take her character to Qeynos (we were in Gfay, and only 1 account)(the character in question was an eighth level mage).  I researched a little, and begged for binds the whole way through (I knew I wasn't gonna get a TP, why try).  Got through Kith at 2AM, how I'll never know, now.  Got bound in Rivervale, got through HHP, which was very heavily camped at the time, was traveling down the ramp in EK, got to the first tower, and something was spawned in there!  It immediately aggros, stuns, and knocks me off the side.<BR>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<BR>Zone into kith, decide to cut that little corner of the zone, get aggroed by some kind of knight, think maybe I got lucky when he didn't immediately chase.  I apparently got just far enough away to not be able to see the casting he was doing.<BR>LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<BR>Ride high on the wall in Kith, middle of the day (taking no chances), get through HHP, zone into EK, realize that the map on EQatlas is total crap, and start asking if anyone has seen my corpse.<BR>Immediately get 2 tells, I explain what I was doing when I died (the first time), get a tell back after about 2 minutes - "don't move"<BR>and I'm standing at my corpse, a 60 cleric standing over me, with a 60 mage right beside.  I say thanks, but that wasn't enough for them ).  They tell me that they have to buff me now, and that I need to empty out an inventory slot for the bag that the mage is gonna give me.<P>remember - this is after playing the game for about 2 weeks.<P>I'm soon buffed out the wazzoo, with a bag full of toys from the mage.  they even take the time to tell me the best ways to go through NK and WK.<P>I made my cleric the next day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The very worst CR/Resses ever for me.  Before level 60's level 50 was the max.   Fear was the target, 2 now non existant guilds make a try to break fear.   Mobs use to get bugged at the portal and slayed everyone in both guilds at zonin.  We didn't know this then.  Most logged into "zoning please wait."  So they Call for assistance, I'm in the next groups.  10 groups, all level 45-50 zone in.  The ones that didn't go LD died to the bugged mobs.   4 more attempts were made, we had about 300 corpses in zone.   The only redeaming factor to this was, fear never used to repop after a patch for 12 hours.  <P>We had a patch the next day.    <P>The lamest ress I've had, was Hey i'll give you 100 plat to run over and ress me in XXX zone.  I'm one zone away and at a camp, I say I'm busy try to find another cleric.  2 hours later get another tell, no luck on a cleric could I bug you.  <P>I am feeling bad for him, so I run over there, lost my camp in the process.   Ress him, he tells me he doesn't have the money on him, can I ress his other 2 corpses 3 more zones away at a portal/wizard TP for the money. <P>WTF is wrong with people, do they think tricking clerics gets them somewhere?<P>My favorite request was, I'm in sebilis D2, I get a request from a level 30 guy.  Could you ress me, I'm in hell level and I need help.  I say, "where is that?" He says," Rathe Mountains."   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I'm not anon obviously since he found me out of the blue with who all cleric.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ah the thread that never dies. My worst yet was when I was playing one of my other characters in Great Divide at one of the Kodiak caves in a pick up group, average level of the group is 35.<P>A couple of people leave and we're down to four in the group, things get a bit rough and the tank runs for Velks, the bard stays behind doing crowd control when the rest of the group have already run, I follow the others. I'd told the bard to get out of the cave and above where there was a zone but either he was being valiant or he didnt know where the zone was and dies.<P>I felt sorry for him so I'm spamming gsay asking him what happened, no reply for ages. We zone back out and he's in the zone and finally responds to me. I tell him not to loot all on his body and that I'll run my cleric down from Luclin to come res him and could the group save my spot.<P>So I log and log in my cleric, level 52, not anon. Once I'm logged in I send the bard a tell, I'm on my way. As Im waiting for the portal to GD to activate I send the bard a tell and let him know how long until the portal goes off. When I arrive in GD I send him a third tell, I'm in the zone and will brt. This has taken around 15 minutes at this point. Now I get a reply 'Oh, what lvl res?'. I reply that it'll be a 49 res. 'Oh, u have ur epic?'. No, I reply. 'Well I got a guildie w epic comming to res'. I reply, You didnt think to tell me this?. 'I was zoning' he says. Bull! I think, he was in the zone when I logged off my other character and I've sent him three tells over 15 minutes. I sent you three tells since I logged on, you missed them all? I ask. No reply. So I /ooc to the zone that I hope my group is ok and that I'll be back with my other character shortly and sit and start to camp. 'What %res is 49?' He tells me. Too late, I reply.<P>Gah!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, after last night, decided to post about 2 of my experiences.<P>1- Met this druid in GF while shopping.  We are just acquaintances, never group together, say hello once in a while.  I'm preparing with a group to go into CoM & I get a tell from him asking if I can rez him in EJ.  Since I'm in EJ, I say sure, bring corpse to CoM zone.  He actually has 2 corpses.  About 15 min later the first one arrives.  He has trouble finding the 2nd one.  I tell him politely that I will rez the one that is here but my group is ready to head in & I'm not going to keep them waiting.  Rez done.  A couple weeks/month later, he sends me another tell from one of his alts.  Please come rez this alt before my corpse poofs.  His alt was like lev 15 or something & he was bound on another continent.  Unfortunately, I was already on the move with a group to our hunting spot.  I tell him I can't & he goes off a major tyrade about how everyone uses his druid character & refuses to help him.  Not once, have I ever received/asked for a port from this guy and being a 50+ druid, he should have gotten his alt bound a bit closer.<P>2- Just happened last night.  Was hunting in Ten Mts with 2 friends.  We have a guild hunt in Nurga later in the week.  We wrap things up & stop by in DL to drop off the ranger, then the druid & I are porting elsewhere to do our banking, etc & log for the evening.  No sooner do we land in DL, someone shoots me a tell asking me to rez him & 2 or 3 others out near KC.  I tell him, I'm sorry I can't - I'm just passing thru.  He tells me it will take only 3 mins, etc.  I tell him again, sorry I can't.  We port away.  Then I get multiple tells from the guy about how when he's high enough he will make sure that no group in Seb or any other zone will take me - he knows my name now & he has alts - then tell ME he's gonna put me on ignore.  Go figure - just a rude individual.<P>People like this frustrate you when you go out of your way to rez on a pretty regular basis.  /shrug<P><P>------------------<BR>Nyfeara Panacea<BR>Officer of the Blades of Light<BR>50th Cleric of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ok this one stumped me last night.  I am not sure whether to laugh or cry.<P>I was just coming out of Kaladim with new spells for hitting 49 when I get a tell from a guy who had to have used /who all clerics. He asks me if I could rez him and I ask him where he is.  He proceedes to tell me that he is in the Oasis but will have the group druid pick me up from the bbm druid circle.<P>Well I am not doing anything in particular so I figure why not.  I head over to the bbm rings and wait for the druid whom it seems takes forever to mem the spell and get over here.  After the pick up we head to south Ro and then to the Oasis.<P>We get to the guy and I ask where his corpse is.  He tells me it is in Cobalt Scar but don't worry he won't mind having to go back there when I rez him.  This confused me some and I ask him why he didn't tell me it was a lot further away then the Oasis when I asked him?  He proceeded to ask why it mattered, he is here standing in front of me who cares where his corpse is.<P>Hmmm.<P>Well first I explain that if I could just rez by clicking on your live body why didn't you come to bbm instead of sending a druid to pick me up and run me to you.  And that to rez I must click on the body.<P>All to find out that this is a level 54 Paladin.  If what he said worked he could have clicked himself and rezed.<P>Thankfully the guy was decently polite.  He stood there a second and I could just hear the brain a grinding.<P>After another minute or so of inactivity I told him I was sorry that I couldn't do anything but was hoping I could get a tele back to bbm.  So there I was teleported back to bbm and just shacking my head in wonder about how any level 54 Paladin wouldn't know how to conduct a simple rez.  And secondly how a druid of at least porting level had no clue either.<P>I just hope they bought the characters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I died running through Kith one night.  I'm bound in WK.  I'm sitting at bride in WK and get sent a tell asking me to rez them at such and such a loc.  I'm not that great a locs, but I start out, looking for them.<P>In the meantime, the friend I was running with found someone to rez my own body in Kith.  I tell the person asking for a rez that I'm sorry, but I could not find them in time.<P>I get rez'd, and the person asking for a rez starts harassing me about not giving them a rez.  I finally gate back to NK to rez him just to shut him up.  Went out of my way an hour just because I'm too nice.<P>Turns out, this guy was in HK, and zones closer than I was to my desitnation.

</FONT><HR>Just a side note.<P>I think it is more impolite to leave your group to do a rez than it is to turn someone down for a rez.<P>The only bad rez experiences I can remember are the one where I have to go a great distance only to get there and the person is already rezzed.  Yup, that torques me.<P>And, if you turn down my level 49 rez once, it is turned down.  Don't ask me 15 minutes later.<P>I usually accept donations for rezzes, but don't get upset if I don't get one.  If the rez was a pain, I would be angered for no donation, but I can't think of a time this happened.<P>As for that druid in the hole, I would have never made it to Tox.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with you about some of those guys are just complete idiots.  But I avoid all of that with a set of rules.  Some exceptions to rules will also be posted.<BR>I am 56th so I have the 96% rez finally and no epic.<P>1) I *Never* leave my group to go rez someone<BR>   (exception of a guild member)<P>2) If I'm on free time and they are in my guild or allianced to my guild they get priority rez. (I wont leave group to rez a member of a guild allianced to mine, they should have their own clerics)<P>3) If it's a stranger I tell them I take donations but it isn't necessary.  I will only go up to 2-3 zones away from me. (I will not go through a dungeon for someone)<P>4) I immediatly tell them they *MUST* have someone drag their body to zone-line or I will not rez them.<P>5) Whenever someone starts getting upset and curses me, I immediatly take a screenshot of text and send it to their guild's officers and leader, I also IMMEDIATLY let my guild know so they will no longer help that guild until the issue is resolved.<P>6) Sometimes I will take a day off and do rezzes for 100pp per body.  The rules to this method is they must port me there and back when done, someone must drag their corpse to zone-line.  Once again if they do not compensate you, repeat rule number 5.<P>I hope this helps you.  I love being a cleric.  I have ABSOLUTELY no problems anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Been playing a cleric for a while, and have formulated a few rules. Granted im a 60th lvl <BR>HALFLING cleric. (this point will become evident in a min). But, again some simple little rules of the road.<P>setup:<BR>I hardly ever go /anon or /rol, needless to say i get ALOT of tells. When I get these tells I do a /who all #####, if they are anon, then i ask them to unanon for a min.<BR>I keep a legal pad and pen next to my computer.<P>Rules:<BR>1) If you will not unanon, No rez for Joo.Period.<P>2) if your below lvl 35, sorry. suck it up, it builds character.<P>3) If I have to travel more than 2 zones, sorry, my widdle legs get tired. Sure RS3 helps, but still.<P>4) if im in the same zone as them, then they have to drag it to me, WITHOUT training me. DA and DB are wonderful for leaving their dumb a$$ there to take the rest of the train.<P>5) If they are a complete bonehead about me not helping them or give me grief in any form, I casualy write their name and guild name down on the afformentioned legal pad. <P>6)if when i do the /who all, they come up on the "list" as its refered to. then No rez for Joo skippy.<P>7) i NEVER charge. dont even accept a donation. It is only mana, and time. but If they fit into my rules, then it doesnt really take that long. <P>8) i forgot what eight was for...<P>9) if im in a group, rule 3 is voided, i wont leave, unless I know them, and they are a pretty decent person.<P>10) If they have EVER run up to me and asked for a sow or port before, they go onto the list. jk...I explain to them, that even though im a Halfling, im a cleric..and not all halflings with maces or sticks are druids. If they give me a hard time, They then go on the list. <P>11) anyone who drags a corpse up and drops it at my feet from outta the blue. and then has the gall to say rez now, goes on the list. and promptly gets ignored. <P>12) if they threaten me in anyway, they get on the list. cause, lets face it, a cleric is ALWAYS gonna get a group. it might take some time, but we are always welcome in a group. Its only a game, get over it. <P>13) unlucky 13- ok i gotta throw this in, if VI every gets it in their heads that maybe SF wasnt the BEST place to put ragefire, i might break down and finnish my epic. yes thats right, i do NOT have my epic.<P>14) if in my journeys, i come across an unfortunate fellow's corpse, i will check the rez timer, and then check to see if said person is online. if they are, i send them a tell, saying hey, you need a rez. if they say yes, then Rez inc, if not, or no response, then i go on my merry way. <P>15) All of the above rules can be tossed out the window, if i get the feeling they are in a bad way. or just to be nice. I have gone overland 3 contenants before to rez ppl, just cause they were having a bad time of it. see, im not a complete bastard.<P>I was using my /friends list for the spamheads who used to annoy me, but i find a list with a little jot of what they did to get onto the list works much better.<P>Funno Happykatz<BR>HighPriest <BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR>Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Don't know if you would consider this horrible.  <P>Mind you I was lvl 31ish had lvl 29 rezz (with the 35%exp regain.)  <P>Was running though LOIO heading to FV (to bank, sell, and buy some stones for my symbol) and get a tell from someone asking for rezz at Sarnak fort and offering to pay me 10pp for it (I don't ask for donations but if offered I will accept, and sometimes will cancel the trade just depends on my mood and how much trouble the rezz is,) I said sure (I wasnt doing anything anyway.)  I ran over to the fort expecting to see his group there, to help me from getting destroyed by the sarnaks.  I get there and no one was at the fort (he was soloing inside) except 20 or 30 sarnaks (5 or 6 of which was guarding the entrance.)  I create a plan to run in to grab his corpse drag it out run to zone to break agro then go back to rezz him.  I ask him to consent me, and he asks "what for?"  I told him I can rezz him outside of fort where there is a little safety or inside, where I will get front row seats to see you die again, he consented me.  Anyway, everything works according to my plan.  I zone into FM then back run over and rezz him.  He pops grabs his stuff and runs (no PP for me, I said oh well and head on to FV.)  I get to the bank in FV and get a tell from the same guy asking for another rezz in the fort, because he couldn't find a group and decided to solo in the fort by himself again.  After asking he says "I will pay you this time, I promise."  I send back "fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me."  He then asks what that means.  I laugh and put him on /ignore.<P>Ah well, just another day in the life of a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I was running through Eastern Commons.  Now, on Seveth Hammer, EC is the place to be for player commerce.  Everyone hangs out on the EC end of the tunnel between EC and the Northern Dessert of Ro.<P>So, someone shouts "Looking for a res."  I tell this person that I can do a 50% res (just having reached 34.)  I wait a bit fort a reply, and soon he shouts again, this time: "Looking for a high level res."<P>I was really insulted and annoyed at that.  It was so... rude.  He could have at least replied "No thanks" or some such, instead of trivializing what I could do.<P>He kept shouting constantly for a while.  finally I did a /who cleric, and I was the only cleric in the zone.  (Not surprising -- while there are always throngs of people in EC, it's not an incredibly high level zone where you get raiding parties.)  I told him something like "You know, I am the only cleric in the zone.  You are wasting your time."

</FONT><HR>I don't recall having been harassed or anything ... I did one time get ported over to CS to res two druids who were kiting there, and while I wanted to do it for free, one of them did /split 300 on me (I was only grouped with one of them). Darn, couldn't return it - I arrived without cash - and besides, he disbanded then (after making sure I didn't need a port).<P>My worst res experience was one that I made myself. Two actually.<P>At level 49, I was running through Dreadlands, thinking with JBoots I was fast enough to outrun the Spiders before they would even agro. Ouch, I was wrong. Just past Karnors heading to FV, I managed to get 3 Spiders on my tail, freak out as I try to find the zone (tried rooting, but they broke too fast), and died. A Rogue helped me get my corpse, and after about 45 minutes I am finally back and loot up. Just as I get up from looting everything the Rogue tells me "When are you going to res yourself?"<P>The second one happened about 2 months ago. I was gathering for a Hate raid, and as usual people are duelling before groups are formed up and such. Somewhat annoyed I mem Revive, and bring the slain ones back. Anyway, groups form, we port up, some people die on the way in but most make it to camp. We had a few adds to deal with while doing resses. One who had died was a Cleric, a former guildmember who was 2-boxing with his Warrior at the same time. He asked me to res him, so sure, I do so. I see I have a res memmed (see the Hand Icon) and since we're up there doing resses, I blatantly assume without thinking, that it's the 90-res (I was level 54, no Epic yet). So I cast it, and my eye catches the line "You begin casting Revive" right as it finishes. So I immediatly yell over raid chat, into the zone and to his Warrior in a tell that he must NOT accept it ... people get confused, ask what's up and I see his Cleric appear ... 2,5 blue down the drain. I felt so bad and sure he was angry. He did accept my sincere apologies though, but - damn, that felt bad (even though he didn't see himself that it was a Revive).<P>I never go /anon or /role, though I did used to do so during my early 40-ishes. I must say that the number of res requests is at an all-time low (relatively), and usually people are kind when they do call on me.<P>------------------<BR>- Kaysha Soulsinger<BR>Templar in the 55th Circle of Erollisi Marr on Lanys T'Vyl<BR><I>The road to Heaven is paved with stones from Hell</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Silence. Thinking no more of it, I go back to slaughtering skeletons... er, returning them to their eternal rest. Ten minutes later, another tell. Why won't you rez me? Explain again. Not in Unrest, no rez. But I died in Skyshrine. Huh? I don't even know where that is! Sorry, no. Take too long, I'm in a group.<P>Then the nasty tells start. I reported them, due to content.

</FONT><HR>this wasn't a bad rez experience per se, just a head scratcher.  <P>My Fennin Ro group had just wiped out in Mistmoore (Velma is 39); as I was scribing spells in Lesser Fay I got a tell.  "You have the 50% rez right, can you do a rez?"  Do a who, class is Wanderer (54? 55?), location Lesser Fay.  I replied "Sure, just drag the corpse to the MM zone".  Response -- "Is that Mistmoore?  Come rez me at the Greater Fay zone."  I answered, "sorry, I'm grouped, naked and doing a CR in Mistmoore, you'll need to drag here."  The only reply "Come here to rez -- I'll buff your group!".<P>At that point I zoned into MM to start CR and never responded.  I felt bad, since at over 50 he had to be pretty desperate to want my rez in the first place, but I was absolutely boggled.  I'm 39, naked, and a class that can't cast invis, never mind sow.  He's over 50, can loot all but one item and thus be dressed, has sow AND invis, and wants me to go to him?!?

</FONT><HR>Well, got my first one last night.  I'm still a bit irked over it, not really personally, but more, "How can someone *do* that?"<P>To set the scene, I work 3rd shift, so i'm up all night, even if I'm not at work.  This was WAY early on sunday morning, around 6amish.  Across our Alliance chat channel comes the phrase, "Any clerics on?"  I check the time, I got two hours before bed, and not many clerics on at that time, so, "Sure, 60% rez here.  Where are you?"  <BR>"Lake Rathe".  Not a problem, even though I'm in Kith (small run in with a certain Dragoon in WC), I just got some SoW potions from a guildie for soloing.  Click and I'm off!<P>After doing the normal run from WC to NK (getting lost in HHP, almost running off the ramp in EK due to boredom/lack of attention), I zone into SK.  I let him know I'm almost there.  No response, no biggie, he may just be busy getting the corpse to a rezzable spot.  Long run through SK, and find the zoneline (man, I hate that zoneline).<P>You have entered Lake Rathetear.  /1 Ok, in Lake Rathe, near SK zone, where is the corpse?<BR>Dead silence.  Nothing.  Ok, no problem, maybe he's afk, better send a tell.  Hmm, that's curious, no AFK message, fine.  /time<P>I note the time, and start sending the message every 3 minutes.  Still no response after 10 minutes, I was a bit on the upset side.  At 15 minutes I ask my guild how long I should wait.  They said 5 minutes tops, but what the hey, I've waited this long.  But next time I send the tell, I get the message back, such and such is not online.  <P>Boy did I feel ticked.  And an allied guild member to boot.  *sigh* Ahh, well, live and learn, I suppose.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Its 3 a.m. and I am working on some tradeskills in Shadowhaven when I get a tell asking me for a rezz in Dawnshroud Peak.  I am getting pretty bored with making javelins and most of the zones between Shadowhaven and Dawnshroud are safezones or otherwise low risk.<P>I get to Dawnshroud Peak and see that the guy is in the zone.  I ask him to drag his corpse to the Netherbian lair zone and he asks me really nicely if I can come to the Maiden's Eye zone and rezz his corpse.  I protest at first because I have gotten hammered by mushrooms making that journey in the past but I finally relent and ride high on the wall until I get there.   The entire time I am in zone, there is someone shouting every 5-10 minutes or so asking if anyone has seen his corpse.  I get to the first guy's corpse and I see that he is a necromancer and he has looted all but one item on his corpse and has not been able to drag his corpse because he didn't want to lose his spot in a "really great group".  I am a little pissed but I rezz him.  He gives me 10PP.  10 FREAKING PP!!!  Oh well, I didn't come here with the promise of anything at all so I guess I can't complain.  <P>In the meantime the guy looking for his corpse asks me if I can rezz him when and if he finds his corpse.  I say "sure" and then I ask the necromancer that I just rezzed if he can summon corpse on the guy (who seemed to be at his wits end).  The necro says he is too busy and that his group needs him.  I remind him that I had just rezzed him and it would be nice if we could help some of the other needy players in the zone.  He then proceeds to remind me that he paid me for the rezz.  10 FREAKING PLAT!!!  His opinion was that my 50% rezz really isn't worth much more than that (despite the fact I was the highest level cleric on Luclin at the time).  So I offer to give him the 10 Plat back for the summon corpse.  He wants 100 Plat for it.  After all he has responsibilities to his group.  I say we can wait until he has regained his mana.  He still wants 100 Plat.  I don't know how much those coffins are but this guy seemed to be of the opinion that he was the only paying member of the EQ community.  He seemed to feel that I was only doing my job when I rezzed him but asking for a summon corpse was really putting him out.

</FONT><HR>1. At lvl 52 (or so) I was running from EW to Kael when I got a tell from someone if I could res him in GD. Since I was in GD I said, sure, drag it to waterfall and I will do it. He said he got killed while running from the IC portal and had no time yet to rebind.<BR>I do a /who all dead_player01 and see a lvl 40 warrior in Highhold. Ok I can see his situation and asked him for the loc of his corpse, so i could drag him to the waterfall. He said that he didn't hit LOC, but that he got killed near the hill in the snow. hm.... snow and hills in GD.... I asked him where he ran through and found out he must have been killed between the wiz spire and the northern zoneline. I roamed the whole area, got attacked by wolfs and a giant and finally found his corpse. I dragged him to the waterfall (with the Kromriff army following me). Then I got a tell: Drag me to waterfall, Everhart, a lvl 60 cleric will res me. WTF??? I nearly risked my life and he just decides, that my res is not good enough for a lvl 40 warrior?? and the said cleric is too lazy to find the corpse himself?? I was pretty angry, dumped his corpse at the waterfall and zoned into Thurga where I made a /w all Everhart <BR>[60 Crusader] Everhart, Great Divide<BR>/shrug<P>2. I zoned into Grieg's End with my group, where I saw a couple of bodies lying around. I do a /who all dead_player02 - it shows a lvl 40 warrior (again) in Dreadland. I sent him a tell if he needs a res. And he replied: what level res? <P>Note: I rarely go /role and even if it was a lvl 49 res or even a lvl 39 - he could have been glad not to wait for the portal to open and to run through the zones... <P>/shrug<P>3. I was in Felwithe working on a quest and got a tell: can you res me? I answer, sure, drag it to me. He said, uhm.. I died in FV - I can port you. I said, sorry I can't, I am working on a quest here in Felwithe and FV is not just around the corner. He said: I will give you 50pp. I said: you better look for a cleric closer to FV. He: Common... I need that res lvl 35 (i think) is a helllevel<BR>Me: I am not coming He: but you have a res stick don't you? Me: yes I do, but still I am not travelling through x zones to res someone, when I have other things to do..

</FONT><HR>I just recently got my epic.  One night I was running to KC to duo with my monk husband.  There was a huge train as soon as I zoned in.  I ended up zoning out and then zoning back in.  I noticed several corpses scattered on the ground.  So being the nice person that I am, I began to click on them with epic.  I was a little pissed that out of the 7 rezzes that I did I only received 2 thank yous.  The rest of the 5 people just looted their corpses quietly not even thanking me for what I did.  I don't expect any payment, and I know that epic is manaless, but still I believe that I deserved at least a simple Thank you for taking the time to rez them.  So after this experienced, this sure taught me to rez corpses without them asking first.  All I can say is that there are a lot of ungrateful people out there, and I'm not going to rez corpses that I see anymore unless they ask me nicely.  <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=13357" TARGET=_blank><B><I>Rosieana Deceiver</B></I></A> <BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Serenity's Wake<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>/Agree Rosieana<P>Can't stand it when people considers the epic to be the same as no need to be polite cause you spend no mana, they still get 96% xp back and that can be quite a bit of time saved, at least a thank you to the cleric is in order, you did not have to rez them epic or not, when i play my necro and been given rezzes i always thank the cleric for it, being that i'm not very rich i can't afford to pay them, on the other hand i never ask for a rez either(or port or sow)<P>And as for my comment on paying i been having like 50pp in the bank but finally managed to get over 2k, will get some peridots to give the cleric as a thank you(5 or 10 perhaps)<P>I know this is a game but i still think being polite makes the game more fun for all.<P><P>------------------<BR>/Thotam lvl 14 DE cleric Antonius Bayle<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23617" TARGET=_blank>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=23617</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I always make it a point to thank those people who do kind deeds for me.<P>On ocassion I do not know who to thanks and an /ooc is usually what I have to rely upon.<P>It is inconsiderate to not even attempt to thanks someone for help, but also remember that when no one has talked to you and you have something granted to you out of thin air you may not know who to thank and will be just as confused as the nice cleric that is patiently waiting for that thank you.  I have been on both sides before.<P>Since you may not be in zone or near enough to see the spell being case or the cleric has to leave the scene of the miracle, it is not always clear who to thank for the help.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
