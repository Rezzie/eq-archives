The bandit camp containing the Sister's not only will yieid you bronze weapons ( and other assorted loot), but collect one necklace from each of the four women and return them to the Drunkard in Kelethin.  The experience and reward are quite fair in my mind.  The sisters can be difficult to pull one at a time so keep this in mind when you are fighting them.<br />
<br />
Nearby there is also a shrine where mummies and  large skeletons can be found.  Use your spells against undead and get some practice in while your there.<br />
<br />
A word of warning from someone who learned the hard way:  Stay away from the Brownie camp area!!  Those puppies have a bite to them and will take you down faster than you can turn around.<br />
<br />
If you are sick of the squabbling and over crowded conditions of CB, give Lesser Fay a try.  I think you'll be glad you did.   <br />
