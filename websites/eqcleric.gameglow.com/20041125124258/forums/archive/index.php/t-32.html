I have not really adventured that much in SolB, so I have a few questions I would like to ask some of the more well traveled members.<br />
<br />
1.  My understanding is that it may take more than 6 players to break the room, but 6 can easily hold it?<br />
<br />
2.  As I understand it, the trouble with Efreeti is getting to the room?<br />
<br />
3.  From 2), I guess this means that it is not the type of camp where you can invis and run there, even though the room may be camped?<br />
<br />
4.  Based upon (3), are there lists anyway?  or is this basically a closed dungeon crawl?  Is this room constantly being farmed?<br />
<br />
5.  Are Efreeti raids ever formed from pickup members standing around in SolB?<br />
<br />
6.  How would I go about getting myself in an Efreeti raid?<br />

<br />
Efreeti groups are frequently formed from pickups but those kinds of groups are risky, unless all the members or most of them are folks you are used to working with!<br />
<br />
No invis and running to room, mobs see invis and are quite nasty, you would be hard pressed to make it there and if you did you'd train the room. =P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a back way to the efreeti room sorta  via SOL A. Me n Catbik discovered it recently. Aparaently no one uses it at all as it's kinda hard to find in SOL A. (there is also a unused zone area there in SOL A too-ye just bounce back from zone over n over n over) It opens intoa room with 4 bats, one in the beginning of the hallway, one in a niche above the spot where we sat to pull, one or two in room. And one (sometimes two) in a niche above the ramp down to the BUg room.<br />
 This room has a walkway with a hole in it and a lava river and waterfalls below. Kinda scary, and for brell's sake dont fight near taht edge and be careful pulling through there. Falling would be messy indeed. Though I do itch to explore the lava there someday. (LEV 200 FR and Both me INvuls available while someone keeps room cleared...I can always gate hehe hehe)<br />
 But on entering the room you go across and down the ramp (LDCs BUGS spawn here) NOX spawns in this ROOM btw as does the guano harvester (never saw it). In the room  below is a stage like platform with bugs on it and two exits...one leads to near where the lava guardians/elementals are and another to the other staging area.<br />
 You can pull single lava elementals once all bugs a cleared if you stage down from that room. But the room respawns fairly fast (19 minutes or faster) and wanderers are prevolent too. With a chanter, a monk, two mages, an evac and a cleric, you could set up shop here and pull all day and reap exps...eventually you might get lucky and just pull the Fruity up here. Who knows you might just have a hasted monk target the fruity run and FD near zone and have someone tag the Fruity (chain pull) to zone where the  pets can engage him till one or other is dead. Monk and move up FD'n on way and then add to fight or zone. Snare/root Fruity heal pets... go to town...it has possibilities...but then there's the time tested method that everyone else uses.....</div></div><hr />

Several have also explored the lava, and there was a discussion recently about the path to swim out if you do end up in the pool. <br />
<br />
I don't know if they have tried it from Brodder's spot, but I'll bounce it off a few monks who know the area well.<br />
<br />
BTW, Kung, a Level 60 Monk and a Level 60 Shaman have done this raid as a group of 2, so I think Efreeti raids are going to be getting smaller and smaller in the future.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And if you want to do this run the easy way, bring a high level enchanter along.  Pull 4? No problem.  We once handled a 6 pull (included beetle); was the worst single pull I've ever seen on the efreeti run.  With a good enchanter it doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
We did this run last night with 5 players, one being the aforementioned enchanter (level 52, she got 53 on the Efreeti Lord Djarn kill).  It was..... way easy.  Had 1 three pull, and somehow, right before we entered the room itself, the three across the pit joined the party.  Again, no problem.<br />
<br />
Group makeup last night: 54 Warrior, 52 Wizard, 48 Ranger, 52 Enchanter, 52 Cleric.  But we were doing it with a group of 6 easily pre-Kunark.  The key is the Enchanter and tanks.  Imps have 6500 hit points and hit very hard.<br />
<br />
I've held the room with three people (2 level 50 clerics and an enchanter), but I don't really recommend it.<br />
<br />
I suspect we'll try the run with 4 soon.  I think with a monk, cleric, wizard, enchanter group we can do it (although it will take a while).  The enchanter wants to try it with just me and her (she needs me for the bandaids), but that might wait a level or two.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorad</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;&quot;1. My understanding is that it may take more than 6 players to break the room, but 6 can easily hold it?&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Yea six 40+ could hold the room - it's a long boring camp. That why the efreeti is not farmed. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;2. As I understand it, the trouble with Efreeti is getting to the room?&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Yep if you can get to the room you own it.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;3. From 2), I guess this means that it is not the type of camp where you can invis and run there, even though the room may be camped?&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Everything in SOLB can see through invs.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Based upon (3), are there lists anyway? or is this basically a closed dungeon crawl? Is this room constantly being farmed?<br />
<br />
Well once a group gets to room they will farm it until everyone gets boots - umm it's really hard to get to the room so No it not farmed liked Ghoul Lord in LG - no list ect...<br />
<br />
<br />
5. Are Efreeti raids ever formed from pickup members standing around in SolB?<br />
<br />
On Rodcet Nife I have seen pickup groups form from time to time. They usually end up in 3 hr CR. If you do join a pickup group make sure you know how they are going to do loot before you go. I try to refrain from joining pickup groups as I have seen some stupid fights over loot. Not my ideal of fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;6. How would I go about getting myself in an Efreeti raid?&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
Hang around SOLB until one forms. Find someone who knows how to break efreeti room and ask them to help you. Put together a guild event (if you are in a guild) - find a guild that camps efreeti offten and offer your services.<br />
<br />
I was in this guild a while back and the way we did it was to have all Casters get boots then in return the casters would help all the Tanks get YK or Mirth 2hd swords. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take someone who's done it before, preferably the puller. If you don't time it the right way, and pull to specific spots on the route you will die a quick death. I wouldn't suggest using pets until your group has a little experience with the insertion. Once you are in the room pets are ok however.<br />
Good luck.<br />
p.s. If you have a trade skill, bring materials to practice it. If not, prepare to work on some other skill, it's a BORING A$$ camp! I took Sense Heading up 120 skill points on one raid alone heh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erolotis</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FYI-<br />
<br />
Take 2 groups and a FD puller and chanter are a must if you are 40-45th group. Other group can leave after break.<br />
<br />
Chanter and FD puller= VERY important.<br />
<br />
Also, for CRs in case something unforseen happens, have a rogue alt. logged outside SolB or have a rogue in group. They can hide/sneak through everything but bats and beetles. I used my rogue alt. for a CR there, very useful only need SoW and lev to get over lava.<br />
<br />
Also, if your group is tired and wants to leave and some friends want to take over or a essential member of the group wants ot log (EVACER or Cleric) you can use the rogue to drag someone from the outside into the camp for a res. Just have the person duel to the death at zone, /consent, drag in for res. Can avoid the re-break this way.<br />
<br />
Also, DO NOT pull outside mobs after taking room  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a member with Trivial Pursuit in group to pass the longgggggggg hours of camping PHs  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.<br />
<br />
Not to disuade you, I have seen 7 boots drop in 8 hours or none in 6, it can be a boring camp.<br />
<br />
Time your spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gniss Fleshmender</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wadda mean, don't pull? If the entire break party is still there, pulling is great exp, even when alternating kills. I helped a break, and stayed for 2 hours due to the exp rolling in from the pulls. gained more than I would have in king room over the same time frame.<br />
<br />
To pull properly, you NEED an experienced puller who can FD, and it helps to levitate them, just in case.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ixcor</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have gone on multiple and i do mean multiple efreeti raids that last for hours.  The best combination is 3 groups for break in or a minimum of 2 groups for the break in.  If you really have a good mix of players you can do the single group but it will take you twice as long to get there due to down time.  The best puller is a Monk or a class that can FD.<br />
<br />
Once you get into the room, a choice must made at this time.  <br />
<br />
If you intend to just be in the efreeti room and not go out and pull monsters into the efreeti room.  Then only one group is needed to hold the room.<br />
<br />
If you intend to pull monsters into the efreeti room, accounting for the down time on mana.  It is recommended you have two or more  groups available to pick up the slack if the efreeti makes an appearance.<br />

I believe those coffins set somebody back about 1600pp<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakalwe</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, sounds exactly like my first efreeti run. We got to the room with 2 groups fine, no problem. A few left, so we rejuggled to make 2 groups, a 4 and a 5, and pulled imps between djinn spawns. Got 1 pair of boots and a ring before all of a sudden 4 imps charge into the room.<br />
<br />
It was messy. Needless to say, only 1 person survived (me), my gate went off with 100hp left. Coffins all round for that one, and we have absolutely no idea what caused it either.<br />
