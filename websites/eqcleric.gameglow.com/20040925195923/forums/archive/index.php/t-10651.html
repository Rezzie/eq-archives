Sorry, I know this turned into a zone guide, but it's GREAT for these levels  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Graphics:<br />
<br />
Absolutely stunning, a crystal mine with many animations of reflecting water.<br />
<br />
Monsters:<br />
<br />
Ry`gorr orcs (Velium weapons, but no armor unortunately), crystal spiders, geonids, stalag terrors, and dracnids.<br />
<br />
Hunting:<br />
<br />
The only spellcasters are the Ry`gorr Oracles, although crystal webmasters (big spiders) can blind. Clerics can use Root/Wrath to easily solo blue orcs near the Eastern Wastes zone. Deeper in, the queen room is a very good camp with lots of experience (think two bubbles an hour) and nice loot. The queen room can be easily held by a five person 35 group of 3 tanks, cleric, and an enchanter. Less efficient groups should be larger or higher level. Geonids can also be hunted near an alternate zone-out to Eastern Wastes, although it is very annoying to run back if you have to zone.<br />
<br />
Loot:<br />
<br />
Platinum drops off Ry`gorr, dracnids, and queen.<br />
<br />
Crystalline Sword (1hs, 11/29): Better than a ykesha. Looks awesome too. Common drop from Dracnid Retainer, with placeholder A Crystal Webmaster. Retainer spawns roughly 1 every 3 PHs.<br />
<br />
Crystalline Belt (AC 5, 0.8 wt, +3 WIS, +3 AGI, +10 hp): Great belt for clerics. Common drop from Ry`gorr Inspector, with placeholder Ry`Gorr Foreman.<br />
<br />
Herbalist's Pack (6 slot 1 wt): 25% weight reducing bag. Common drop from Ry`gorr Herbalist, with placeholder Ry`Gorr Oracle.<br />
<br />
There are also a few nice rare drops such as the 20/40 +5 STR +5 WIS Paladin only piercing weapon.<br />
<br />
Utility: Accessed through the Ry`gorr fort in Eastern Wastes. Go inside and follow closely the outside wall. You will come to a cage at the back of the fort. Inside is a stone hand holding a crystal. Click on it to zone into Crystal Caverns. Invisibility is required to traverse through this dungeon, although in the tunnels near the zone Root/Atone works well. There is a Coldain town located near the middle of the zone. You start off dubious and as far as I can tell, there is no way to raise faction. This means that you can bank but not sell.<br />
<br />
This zone is often nearly empty. However, there are only three good spots to hunt in, zone line orcs, orcs in the pit, and the queen room, so the zone fills up very quickly. Clerics are always wanted and needed, but isn't that true throughout all dungeons?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
