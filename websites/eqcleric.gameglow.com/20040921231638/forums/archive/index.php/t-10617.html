<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erydin</div><div class="date">02-01-2002, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my wife and I are level 30, cleric and a warrior.  We are both fairly well set for equipment till high 40's at least. (minus some haste items we would like to get our hands on some day http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  We have been hunting recently in Mistmoore for about 8 levels now, the exp is still pretty mean there even at 30 just due to the fact we can consta pull now and the nice xp bonus mistmoore gets.  However, its beginning to get boring, hella boring in fact.  I would like to move us to somewhere else, preferably somewhere without a billion people(we spent all of about an hour in Lake before it drove us nuts and we moved over to FM for a while).  We also hate downtime, so hunting yellows we would like to avoid if possible, or single spawn spots.  Basically loot makes no real difference to us and massive xp for every second we spend is not a real big thing on our list either, just somewhere without 100 people constantly yelling at each other over ooc/shout, where we will get some decent xp.  Suggestions appreciated  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif thanks<br />

Iceclad-cougars are mad exp, horrid loot and are plentiful enough to easily support 5 groups between the first two islands. In mid 30s, you could start moving to Tower of Frozen Shadow if you want to do something fun (and crazy dangerous with that whole unsoulbonded key thing-but WOW, its fun) =P<br />

<br />
During your Mid 30s, ToFS is a must. Very fun zone. That non Soulbound Key issue really keeps you on your toes. Lots of Undead so you can even break out those nukes every now and then. Plus, EQAtlas now has maps!<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns always receives rave reviews and the loot is nice to boot.<br />
