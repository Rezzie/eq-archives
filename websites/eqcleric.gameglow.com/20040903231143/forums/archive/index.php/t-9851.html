<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xthor</div><div class="date">06-14-2000, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...just to show how much of a newbie I am...this is the first time something like this has happened to me and it really ticked me off.<br />
<br />
I was in BB with a couple friends from work.  I'm a lev 10 cleric, and was grouped with a lev 8 ranger.  We had come across Corflunk and killed him, and my friend was carrying the head.  A friend of ours, a lev 6 ranger, showed up and was fighting near us (so I could heal him if needed) but he wasn't grouped with us.<br />
<br />
My friend noticed the other Ogre (Zarboomi or something like that) nearby and pulled her.  The two rangers started hitting her, and I started the med/heal thing.  I went oom, and the lev 8 ranger died.  I started tanking and we had her hurt pretty bad.  The lev 6 ranger died.  It was looking bad...just me and her...  I got down to 1 bub of health but managed to kill her.<br />
<br />
I started waiting for my friend to come get the other head so he could complete the quest.  I was scanning the horizon making sure nobody snuck in to steal the head.  (Note to self...in the future, just hold the loot position until the other person shows...)  In one 360 degree turn, a #*&amp;%&amp;$ level 5 dwarf warrior appeared out of nowhere and was looting the corpse!  I said &quot;Hey, Don't steal!!&quot;, but he of course stole the head and took off.  (Not before alerting a couple of goblins to my presence, though.)<br />
<br />
With only a couple of bubs of health, I managed to beat off the goblins.  I did the only thing I could really do...  Shouted &quot;Thanks for stealing out loot xxx.  You suck.&quot;  His crushing reply was to should &quot;Lier.&quot;  Great...I'm dealing with somebody who didn't pass 4th grade spelling...<br />
<br />
I sent him a tell &quot;You and I know the truth...that's all that counts.&quot;  And added him to ignore.  Hopefully someday he'll be in a position to need my help and I can be petty and small and remind him of this.  (Ok, maybe I'll be over it by then...it is after all just a game.)<br />
<br />
I was so ticked I decided to petition.  I realize they probably wouldn't do much, but what the heck...maybe they'd at least take the head away from him and that would be enough for me.  I did a /who all gm and saw one level 50 GM.  So I did the petition.  About 5 min later, I did another /who all gm and guess what?  No GMs.  I played for another 45 min or so, but never saw any other GMs on the server.<br />
<br />
*sigh*  I hope I don't run into too many more people like this.  Maybe this jerk will run out and buy Diablo II and be gone from EQ.  <br />
<br />
Anyway...if you made it this far...thanks for reading my rant...<br />

<br />
When I was growing up in Butherblock, there were alot of /shouts that went something like &quot;Looking to loot Zarchoomi or Corflunk's head&quot;, or something close to that. More often than not the toon doing the shouting was waaaaay too young to fight wither Ogre one on one, and just looking for a quick way to some good exp and a piece of Bloodforge armor...<br />
<br />
On a related note, I still have one of those Ogre heads in my bank, but have long since forgotten who it was.. hehe my safety deposit box must reek something fierce.<br />
<br />
/em plugs his nose to do his banking<br />
