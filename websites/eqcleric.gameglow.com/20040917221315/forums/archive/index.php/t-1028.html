<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erzebet</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question.  I don't want this to turn into a flame-fest, so please don't take this as monk bashing, but I really need to get some advice.  <br />
<br />
Recently, I’ve spent a lot of time hunting in Dalnir.  Dalnir is a great dungeon for level 25 to 35 in Kunark.  There are plenty of MOBs, lots of great spots to hunt, and the opportunity to actually crawl the dungeon (especially considering how unpopulated it usually is).  BUT, (and this is the big BUT) Dalnir has TONS of monk items, including some no drop items, so there are more monks around than I’ve ever seen.  (Kinda like the explosion in SK’s and rogues that you notice when you hunt in Cazic.)<br />
<br />
So here’s my problem.  I’ve never grouped with more than one monk at a time before here.  And I understand that it is nice to have a monk who can FD and prevent bad pulls and split MOBs for good pulls.  But I have a horrible time justifying the amount of mana I have to load into one when they are in my group.  And the time I had 3 monks, a pally and me was unbelieveably bad.  From my perspective, I think the monk should immediately FD upon returning from a pull, and secondary type monks (non-puller) should avoid attacking until the Pally or other more appropriate tank has the MOB’s attention firmly in place.  When a MOB turns to a monk who has gotten it’s attention, again, I think he should FD so it returns to the Pally.  Am I wrong in my opinion?  Is there some way other than FD that a monk has to prevent himself from getting mauled?  I know they have naturally high agility and high agility items, but it really takes only a couple of connecting hits for the monk in my group to be down 3 bubbles of health or more EVERY fight.  I would understand if we were lacking in the tank department, but it was clearly stated to this group that they needed to let the Pally take the hits, and to back off if necessary.  Yet none did.   Do the good players of this class eventually learn this?  At what level?  I am 30th.  If they haven’t figured it out by 30th, it makes me wonder exactly when they do…<br />
<br />
Let me be clear.  This is not the first, or only time I’ve grouped with monks.  I’ve been here in Dalnir for quite a while, rarely without having one in my group.  This WAS the first time I’ve ever had three in one group.  The end result was me, dead, due to the amazing amount of healer aggro I had to deal with.  Chain healing three different monks is not good for the hatelist.  Anyway.  Any advice you have would be great.  As it stands, I’m pretty hesitant about adding a monk to my group if we already have one.  And at this point, will not be grouping with three of them again.  <br />

They make great pullers when peeling off unwanted extra incomers, but I have to say, if there is a monk in the group, it seems like that is where my mana is going. Your idea of the monk FD when reaching the group and having a real tank take the first few blows and gain a strong aggro is great. May try that next time I'm with a monk puller and tank. Other than that, I would tell the monk if he/she is going to try and aggro the monster to use Mend as much as possible. The only other class I tend to sponge mana onto are rangers hehe(and stupid tank druids, god i hate that). If a class other than tank is taking alot of damage and causing me unneeded mana drain, I will often shout in all caps for them to back off and let the tank take the damage for awhile. Not sure what everyone else thinks about monks, and how to keep them alive longer then usual, so any input would be greatly appreciated  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

If not it can get dicey.  More than once I have gotten the crud kicked out of me while a monk(that I just healed 4 times) beats on the creature's back to no avail.  <br />
<br />
When I AM in a group with only a monk as a tank, I back as far away from the fight as possible, for some reason, distance has something to do with aggro. <br />

<br />
Most of em learn eventually.<br />
<br />
At L50, pre-Kunark, I out-tanked any warrior on my server, even the ones with a lot of Indicolite.  It's changed a lot since Kunark, with warriors getting huge AC upgrades and monks actually losing due to the stupidly heavy weapons we have been forced to adopt, but I'm still by no means a mana sieve at 58.<br />

Maybe you are grouping with monks that don't have very good equipment. I also regularly group with a monk that feigns briefly every time he gets aggroed. It seems to work pretty well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always request/demand/beg the monk to FD when he gets back with a pull. Sometimes I have to tell them flat out that I will not heal them if they are not FD, that usually gets there attention. This  practice does 2 things, one is that it gets the MOB onto someone who can be more efficiently healed. The other is it prevents me from drawing any agro from the MOB. Monks usually are beet up a bit when they get back from spliting a pull and need an imediate heal, not a good way to start off a fight if I want to be able to sit back down.  =)<br />
<br />
In situations where mana efficiancey is important, I will request that the monk FD if he starts tanking. Most good monks will understand the reasons for this if you take a few seconds to explain it to them.<br />
<br />
To any monks out there that see this, just because your ac may be higher than that warrior your grouped with doesn't mean you are just as good or better at tanking. First of all, monks don't have near the hp as a warrior, so even if its a situation where I can consistantly CH a monk, its not as efficient as on a warrior. <br />
Second, a lot of your ac is a different kind of ac than warriors have. There are different components to AC, the number you see as your AC is just a BS agragate number that Verant gives us to look at and compare with eachother. Monks armor and defense skills give them better damage avoidance than warriors. But the type of ac warriors get from thier armor gives them much better average damage reduction than monks have. Basicly, on average, monks will get hit less often than a warrior, but when they do get hit, the average damage they take is higher.<br />
Not sure I stated that as clearly as I wanted, no, I am not saying there is such a thing as damage reduction from armor types, that officially doesn't exist.<br />

<br />
Most of my levels I've grouped with two iksar monks and they're just as capable as tanking as the other tank classes.  One who is lev 49 now with no exceptional armor has well over 900 ac and will always groupsay 'mend up' or 'mend down' to spare what little mana I use on him.  Of course when they're getting really beat on they just FD and let someone else tank for a while, then I CH when the situation is under control.  They do a fearsome amount of spam--er damage.  The longer they're fighting the better.<br />
<br />
Did you symbol the monks also?  With their great dodge/block/etc dmg mitigation skills, plus their insane ac if they're iksars, the only thing that separates them from warriors really is hp and a taunt button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pirmin</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had the same problem with monks at mid levels. Was a frickin full time job to keep them alive, practically chain healing. Didn't like it one bit.<br />
<br />
About 1 month ago (may have been 2) i grouped with some higher level guys in Karnors and among them was one warrior and one monk - both around level 57 or 58. Well these guys (naturally) rocked. The warrior was decked out in full planes/Kunark armor and weapons and so was the monk (hard to see on these guys what they wear but I was told he had the fungi scaled tunic). Now to the weird part - I had to heal the warrior more than the monk! If they tanked a (similar) mob each it was the warriors HP bar I was constantly monitoring. Might have been me missing something but it really seemed this was the case.<br />
<br />
Sometime later the warrior had to leave the group, some people logged and finally it was just me, the monk and a druid... and that monk just kept on going! At one time there was this nasty train and among the MOBs was an Undead Jailer (at least level 50, &quot;You will not evade me, Pirmin&quot;   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ). Well it got all messy.. People dying here and there and finally me and the druid bolted for zone. On the outside we sat down and started medding. After some time we get the following in group say from the monk (who had stayed inside)&quot;Guys get in here&quot;.<br />
<br />
We zone in and there he is - SOLOING the jailer! He is badly hurt of course but he is beating that nasty DOWN! I CH him then sit down to watch - awestruck!<br />
<br />
After the playing session was over I created an Iksar monk - I just *had* to!<br />
<br />
So whenever medding seems boring, whenever I don't have the time to play for any extended amount of time, whenever I just want to have FUN (because, friends and neigbours, monks really are fun to play) and don't need the pressure of keeping a group alive - I log on my monk.<br />
<br />
I've totally revised my stand on monks.<br />
<br />
Simply put - Monks rock!<br />
<br />
PS: Just to clarify - the monk was human.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kandolek</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One technique that might help if you have a tank and monks are still getting beat down is to root/enstill the mob and let the tank stand on it.  A rooted mob will only attack the closest person.  I started doing this with rogues when a tank just couldn't keep the backside of the mob facing the rogue.  <br />
<br />
Melee doesn't seem to break root nearly as much as nuking so you can probably save more mana with the roots than the heals.  Plus, mobs drop real fast with multiple monks going all out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naal</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm sounds to me like u might have got ur hands on some pseudo monks.  <br />
<br />
Yes monks take a little more healing in the pulling phase but generally beat the dang critter to a pulp b4 it hurts them that badly again.  With 2 monks u should have been going thru things like a buzz saw.<br />
<br />
The most important thing when dealing with monks is the following question: Mend up?.  Most good monks will FD pull take a bubble of damage splitting, make it back to the group and then hit mend at 2 bubbles down; pop they are healed.  No cleric aggro from the massive heal u just laid on them, no fear or need to worry.<br />
<br />
Problems occur when u have a monk who doesn't understand that mend recycles every 6 minutes its there to be used, is a twink with gear  that makes them feel invulnerable , or plain just doesn't understand the monk class.<br />
<br />
Sounds like u had multiple problems in Dalnir, starting with a full tank group. 4 tanks will tap your mana bigger time then just 2 monks.  I hope that the paly was handling out of combat heals, because even with that u were gonna need serious downtime after dropping the symbol or even the ac buff cycle on the group.  Also were u using GH to start off the heal cycle or throwing 2 heals? A GH at those levels is truly a way to say CLERIC over here COME HIT ME.  Crowd control in that group was well in the hands of the healer hence none as u were probably in sit med heal mode.  Was the puller maybe pulling a little too fast?  Also where in Dalnir? the goo area? by the port pad? in the drop room?  If u were in the goo caves things can really turn bad because of the closeness of the spawns.<br />
<br />
Dunno exactly what happened to u, but sounds like a case of low mana, no back up, and too frequent pulling.  Me I'll take the 3 monks and slappem into shape.  One getting real low on hit points let him FD a few times clear the aggro stand up and keep pounding, no need to heal him with a biggee cause he ain't or shouldn't be getting hit. 3 monks, heh, Monk A flops to the ground and twitches a few times , critter turns to Monk B, Monk A stands back up pops the critter for more, Monk B does the gigged fish dance, Critter turns to Monk C, etc...<br />
<br />
While I've never done a 3 monk paly I have done a 2 monk 1 warrior, and my biggest concern was time in between to get to 40 or 60 mana.  40 was pushing it but 60 left me some to spare.  30 was possible but it really comes down to communication and understanding between the puller and the healer.  Yes I prefer to stand up throw some stuns, root park a critter out of the way, maybe throw some blows with my hammer, but there are times u just have to bite the bullet and go into heal med cycle. <br />
<br />
The only other thing I might add here is that monks don't need to be healed fully.  They are just fine as long as u can get back to them so that 1 maybe 2 blows won't take them down.  Its the same reason why you keep sitting down when the paly or ranger or caster gets hit for 1 bubble down of health.  Its more important in the long run to conserve the mana for the folks who will need it then to blow it when u low or swamped.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badina</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My primary for 48 days /played was a monk (who is level 34 at this time). <br />
<br />
My 9th character is now a 50th level Cleric (Badina) and is now my primary.<br />
<br />
I played with a group in Dalnir the other day 3 monks, 1 cleric, 1 shaman.<br />
<br />
I was the puller (monk).<br />
<br />
The cleric almost never had to heal me.. I'd bring a mob in, all 3 monks would lay into the mob and it would be down before the shaman could finish slowing it.<br />
<br />
The only consistent time I had to be healed was when mobs did their HT. And you can not blame that on the monk.<br />
<br />
I will also say there are a lot of 'twinky' monks out there who are VERY overweight from using weapons. FYI those who dont know monks lose a monstrous amount of AC when they go over *14 pounds*. <br />
<br />
If you see a monk using a couple of sticks and ask and their weight is at 30 .. and they are say about level 35 or so, you can figure they lost about 40+ AC for using those weapons. This means they are going to get hit more often.<br />
<br />
Thats part of Verants formula to punish monks in expansion, they never had to use weapons to be the top damage dealer before expansion. Now they have to use weapons and many of the best weight 10 pounds.<br />
<br />
The highest level monks do OK under this restriction, the mid level monks get eaten alive with it.<br />

<br />
Me and a good friend of mine group together alot, and he plays a monk. I am always amazed at the damage output he has compared to the damage he takes.<br />
<br />
LoL there is nothing like seeing a monk dodge, block, parry, parry, dodge, and followed up by multiple misses. Heh.<br />
<br />
I was so impressed my alt became a monk. =)<br />
