<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">07-24-2000, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or did Kunark just create a lot more whining then before? <br />
I'm playing less and less because I think people tend to complain about over- under- inbetween-balancing, too strong too weak, infringing on our class, too much exp too lil exp too low a spell... . &quot;Oh no, we cant do any dragon raids.... We are too afraid of dying in these post-50 hell levels that have waaaaaaay to harsh exp penaltys, plus our paladins had thier DW Helms nerfed so they cant heal and then they didnt get any new weapons while everyone else did and wizards and monks suck and they are making everyone group with a cleric and a rogue and.....&quot; <br />
Lets see... all the melee classes are complaining... Paladins lost thier helm... Boohoo, they cant solo, heal, etc... WAKE UP!!! Pallys arent meant to solo. Balance doesnt mean every class can solo just that all classes have pluses and minuses. They also complain about not getting good melee weapons post-kunark, and with that and thier exp penalty they have a hard time getting in groups... Well lets see... I have been in less then 5 2+ cleric groups. I cant count the number of times I've been in 2+ paladin groups. I know I have a lot more paladin friends then warroir friends and the SK's are almost non-existent (I cant figure out why, other then the rogue complex). Only way a ranger is good is as a support to a tank, or with several other rangers (but, when they support they rock). Cant figure out whats wrong here. I agreed with paladins that the FA was a lil hard... Well, now all I have to say is &quot;Cry me a gd river&quot;<br />
Exp penalty too harsh... I remember when it was doubled. I've survived this long why cant I survive the next ten levels... So the 1st 50 were a lil easier. Didnt someone else just announce 60 recently???<br />
But mages/necros pets out-solo me... Yeah they are also dumber then the dumber half of my high school football team after they get so drunk the next thing they remember is when they wake up in some guys bathroom with the only thing keeping him from shootin them is the girl in the room with him... <br />
Monks complaining about being outdamaged and thier weapons and thier plane armour (just gotta say Cryosilk here) and whatever... I cant really understand what they are talking about since I only have a few monk friends... However, I dont think there is much that will replace them.. I dont care if a warroir can outdamage a monk. Then I dont have to heal the monk. When I think monk I'm looking for a puller usually. Until they lose THAT status they have no need to complain.<br />
Can you tell I was in the gameplay thingy for a lil bit today yet? While I was there, 2 people were spamming stupid messages about abashi and the game... Can anyone tell me exactly what thier point was? It wasnt really all that funny, and made them look pretty stupid...<br />
Hmmm... Lets see.. Theres the incoherent, uninformed, misinterpreted posts... Those are about the worst... I HATE those. Then theres the people who dont see things from my pov. I think they should be shot but then I might get kinda lonely  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif.<br />
<br />
I dont understand about complaining about your class. The reason I would start a monk, wizzy paladin ranger... is because I would want to play one. Whats the point about whining about everything thats wrong with it. Why not look at the good points instead? Noone is forcing you to play that class. So what if you have 1000000 days played? If you arent happy wtf is the point? <br />
<br />
well I guess thats about it for today... Dunno if this will make sense to anyone other then me but oh well, it makes me happy.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I'm not against any classes, I'm against those who complain ceaselessly. Waaah, waah, I'm gonna quit since I'm not being fixed... Well shutup and quit already is all I have to say.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aunoa</div><div class="date">07-24-2000, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice rant, but i need to reverse it a little and hopefully balance it.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you yourself are enjoying Kunark, and so am i, but when it arrived things *changed*.  The game i play now post-Kunark is not the game i knew pre-Kunark.  Clerics pretty much walked away unchanged with regards to gameplay post-50 in Kunark, for which i am very thankful. Other classes were, in my opinion, not so lucky.  <br />
<br />
You pretty much covered all class 'whines' in that rant, but lets pick up Rangers (as accesories to tanks) as an example.  Well, up until Kunark a Ranger could be a primary tank, no Warrior required, in pretty much any situation in the old world.  Why should they now have to put up with being an accessory in all Kunark zones?  Ask yourself if you'd be happy to have your role in EQ changed so dramatically once you hit 50.  Would you be happy if your main loved character suddenly underwent a massive change of playstyle?<br />
<br />
It's very difficult to appreciate other classes problems or 'whines' when they are not your own character, and hence very easy to condemn without another thought.<br />
<br />
Would a serious nerf to your cleric cause you to a)be vocal in an attempt to hopefully have someone see your point, or b)quit without another word deleting a character you spent months of your life building up.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your post was a rant (the mage/necro bit makes that clear) but i couldnt let it slip by without comment.<br />

Apparently the feign death pull doesn't 'fit with the vision' (go check the monk's boards)...so it may go.  Monks are, needless to say, concerned for their future role.<br />
<br />
The whining is coming, I think, from frightened customers who used to be reasonably contented but are finding it harder to find groups and have FUN in the post-kunark world.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">07-24-2000, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn, htf are we supposed to pull anything without fd pulling? Let the cleric run in there with DA and have them pick it off  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif.<br />
I realize everything except maybe clerics and enchanters changed dramatically since kunark. A ranger as an accessory tank is adaptable, and I cant find anything wrong with it, they will still have a place in a group. A monk without FD is questionable. I think I should have looked this up maybe, however taking away a monks FD is not something I ever expected in my wildest dreams. I can see a monk complaining about FD but not about whether or not a warroir can beat them in melee. <br />
I see a complete difference in the rangers complaint and the FD issue. A ranger COULD go without a real tank in the group pre-kunark, however as a cleric I ALWAYS knew I was playing with a ranger and not a tank... But now at post 50 levels this is simply not an option. They just have to adapt, the same way I adapted from meleeing at low levels to sit and med at high...<br />
The FD is another issue entirely. This is because monks are Norraths pullers along with SK's and (sometimes) necros. If monks lost FD and stayed the same they would be less attractive to the group. <br />
<br />
As to what I would do should they change the cleric class (not likely, but if FD is destroyed, then nothings sacred) I dont know. It would depend.<br />
<br />
My point is, I havent seen Kunark cause anything more then whining. Aside from that I also havent seen a dramatic shift in the way classes play. I have NEVER and will NEVER consider the rangers as having a dramatic problem with thier class, and havent seen anything change. The post 50 ranger is the same as the pre-50, its just more noticiable. <br />
<br />
I also see people trying to catch Abashi, or anyone working for verant in a lie, a nerf, the spread of aids. Many dont listen or dont understand or something what Verant says. Lord knows that after Grimrot I am definetly NOT a Verant and VI CS supporter, however I can at least look at what Abashi and Co. have to say and at least understand it, maybe not like it or agree with it...<br />
<br />
I really dont understand how the post kunark world can be so much more unhappy then the pre-kunark world... More levels more items more monsters more dungeons.... Maybe people should just hunt in the old world? would that make them happier? <br />
<br />
At the moment I will not change that statement. And if you read the monk part I included my thoughts in there. <br />

-----<br />
<br />
We'll have to settle to disagree on the whole subject then.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I hate to thrash the whole Ranger thing because it's been covered before.  I spent 52 levels of my Clerical life with a ranger as the only tank for the group, and there was nothing that she could not tank pre-Kunark.  You're 100% correct, they are not warriors and should never be mistaken for them, but they could primary tank.  And whether they were deisgned that way with the vision in mind or not (as is now apparently the case) that is the way nearly all rangers played their class - as primary tanks, unless a warrior (which used to be quite rare to see a lot of about) was in the group.<br />
<br />
Now take a Ranger as primary tank into Sebilis and see how long they last.  Can you cast Superior heal before they're dead?  Why make them wait until they get Jolt to have to stop messing around ducking in &amp; out of fights?  Dont say monks have always had to do this, because Rangers were not like this pre-50.<br />
<br />
It's all very easy to say 'well adapt then' but (and this is where we're differing on points of view   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ) it all comes down to how you view the game.  Why should a person who picked a class because they like to be in the thick of melee and tank (which is what Rangers WERE pre-50) now adapt to what is effectively an accessory.  It is not the class they originally loved &amp; chose to play.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of rangers are adapting, but it's not their original role, and you must ask yourself if it was really fair of Verant to change their role when many many people were comfortably established and happy with their class at such a late stage in the game.<br />
<br />
And as for people trying to highlight Abashis/Verants lies.....well.....there are an awful lot of trash posts on the Flameplay boards, but Abashi also fails to engage his brain before speaking sometimes, just look at what he said about Feign pulling, im still laughing my ass off that he actually said that 3 weeks down the line.  And if Verant says nothing is wrong with rangers, what's up with the following?<br />
<br />
We will not reconsider ranger defence caps, deal with it.<br />
Time passes.<br />
Er...hold on, better have Jolt.<br />
Time passes.<br />
Er...hold on, better double your archery to encourage you to step out of melee.<br />
Time is passing.<br />
<br />
I've whined about rangers here, but i'll have a stab at defending any other class gripes if you wish. :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">07-25-2000, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets see... Never denied rangers could tank stuff pre-51. I said it WAS noticiable that you were dealing with a ranger then tho. The ranger as a viable tank went down every level they played. At 10-20 or so it wasnt the noticiable, but it was very pronounced at 40+ when I killed some of them ogres in ogguk. The only thing that happened to them is the mobs got a lil harder post-kunark. Rangers have never had hp's/ac like a true tank. Thier role hasnt shifted enough to make me worry. I dont know many rangers who need to duck out of fights. Rangers do not have to change thier playstyle post-kunark, they just need to stay in the old world forever. Change was introduced to the game. Along with change generally comes two choices. Whether to adapt or to stay static. Noone is forcing Rangers to play in kunark or to adapt to the new style of playing. <br />
Second consider this. How easy it is for Verant and Abashi to announce a nerf and how long they take to put in something positive. If you consider it, there are some good reasons for this. 1. It is a lot easier to remove a nerf then it is to remove something beneficial to the players. 2. They can just rip the nerfs out any time they feel like because noone will complain. Anything givin to the players is like pulling teeth. Verant wants to be absolutly sure they want to put the improvements in before they go ahead with it. 3. Balance. They want to keep the game balanced. While I dont agree with some of VI's solutions to certain problems, I understand what they want to do. 4. Abashi cannot make promises, say anything about anything they are going to do to the game or affect classes. Why? Because then he just has a whole bunch of the players breathing down his neck about what he said. <br />
<br />
Now I'm not denying Abashi and Verant have a real tough time answering people about the game. But its better then what I've seen for other online games up to this point. There is an interaction with the players at least, and generally they do end up getting that which needs to be fixed, fixed. Even if it takes a year. What I dont like is when Abashi gives an answer. People peruse the answer in a second or so then dismiss and and ask for a second opinion because they dont like the 1st one. OR they look at Abashi's answer and then take it to mean something else. <br />
<br />
I cant think of a much better alternative for Abashi to get information to and from the players yet. Your position would be stronger if you had a viable answer to how Abashi should send and recieve player info. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aunoa</div><div class="date">07-26-2000, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My last post as we clearly differ fundamentally on this.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
----<br />

----<br />
<br />
To me, this is the root of the issue.  There is a deeper issue here than whether they should adapt or leave blah blah, it's whether such a change should have been forced on people NOW, post level 50, with god knows how many months invested in their character.  It's an issue of fairness, and the answer to me is No, it shouldnt.  I dont play this game to bimble along powering items etc happy to fit in as necessary so long as i get my xp and my loot.  <br />
<br />
I play my character &amp; the class i chose, and i dont expect it to be changed when im fully established so late in the game.  Subject closed because we obviously differ on points of view in terms of what the games about.<br />
<br />
----<br />
I cant think of a much better alternative for Abashi to get information to and from the players yet. Your position would be stronger if you had a viable answer to how Abashi should send and recieve player info. <br />
----<br />
<br />
Which position is that then?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I *used* to hold Abashi in very high regard, particularly with respect to the effort he put in in maintaining the link between Verant and the customers.  Issues were discussed, questions were answered, *full* explanations used ot be given.<br />
<br />
Over the past couple of months his attitude has changed considerably and it's becoming distinctly 'You dont like it? Tough', and it gets thrown up all too commonly as an answer to viable questions that deserve an explanation.<br />
<br />
Don't have a rogue?  Don't play in that Dungeon.<br />
<br />
There is an attitude developing, go and look at his latest response to Monks.  You may suggest he has a right to behave like this with the crap he receives but remember - he is an employee of Verant.<br />
<br />
We're running off topic here with Abashi.  As i said before, 99.99999% of everything posted to the Flameplay boards is utter trash, so im not sure why we're considering it.  In no way do i consider any of the small minority of players that post there anything like representative of the overall player base.  Hence i dont quite see what you're driving at.  The current system works as is, because you will never be able to block the mindless morons from posting with an alternative method.<br />
<br />
People pick holes in Abashi's statements because they're often sitting ducks with a 50 foot target strapped to their backs and a large neon sign reading 'Kick me'.  I offer you his FD statement as an example.<br />
