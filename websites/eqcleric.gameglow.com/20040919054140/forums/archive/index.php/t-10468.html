There are crocs, orcs,etc.  With a warrior and a cleric you could do almost any of the Corcs except for Lockjaw(a named croc with a bad attitude).  Then when you are ready and have a group you can go over to orc alley(anyone have the loc?).  I suggest a full grp if you are lvl 14.Oh and also watch out for the Giants and to lvl 14 15 people watch out for the Dry Bones Skeletons.  There are usually people at the docks to help you if you get in trouble.  So if you do just shout &quot;(what ever is chasing you) to the docks please help!&quot;.  Well this is just about all i know about the Oasis.  I have only been hunting here for 2 or 3 lvls so i have a lot to learn.</div></div><hr />

Especially since alot of the normal people in this levelrange has move to LOIO, there arep usually plenty of crocs to kill.<br />
<br />
You will probably come back to Oasis when you get some more levels. The spectres are a great way to get some xp the solo way  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

Crocs rarely aggro on you even if you are medding.  If you can find a twinked warrior, pair; else find a third and take out Deep Water camains and Deep Water Crocs to gain nice xp.  The loot is almost non-existant but the xp is great.</div></div><hr />
