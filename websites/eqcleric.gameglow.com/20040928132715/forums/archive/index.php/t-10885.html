<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xodd</div><div class="date">08-09-2001, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Info I have found. We came upon this mob while exploring DN with 3 groups or so. We got him down to about 50 but 3 adds pretty much ended it for us. CR was a bit lengthy so we didnt go back for a second try. He seems a lot like VS. <br />
<br />
Vaniki - Level 63<br />
<br />
Drops willsapper. 13/20 9ac 35hp effect: lifetap/slow(Energy Sap) Magic, Lore, No Drop, Primary ONLY<br />
<br />
1. Don't believe he can be slowed<br />
2. Has a Flurry disc that he uses, alot<br />
3. 500pt lifetap that he uses, alot<br />
4. He sees sneak and invis.<br />
5. and by far the worst, he gates. <br />
<br />
There is seemingly no way to interrupt his gating. He cant be stunned bashed, nothing apart from finishing him off. If he does gate, you're in a world of hurt. Unless you fight him right by his bind point he certain to bring adds, some times lots of them, and even if you can handle them by the time melee get on him again he will have lifetaped his way bay to 20%.<br />
<br />
Vaniki can spawn at two points that I know of. If you are at the begining of the Chetari cave and go left there will be a large room again on your left a bit down. His bind spot is in the center of this room between the two waterfalls. His other bind spot is in the room right before Zland on the ledge overlooking the big pool.<br />
Rangers cant always pick him up right away as the zone is very big and track range is limited.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Get him up against a wall and have everyone (even rogues) stand so they're pushing him into and along the wall.<br />

The fight is long enough that your enchanters should have plenty of time to completely drain all his mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mobs can gate after having 3 enchanters ToT/wandering mind/sieve them for the duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
i think gate is like some freaking discipline for casters. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's your problem. I think wandering mind is bugged currently, and it will increase both enchanter's and mob's mana. I'd just stick to mana sieve and theft of thought. I stick strictly to mana sieve and I never have problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
followe by<br />
<br />
%t begins to cast a spell<br />
<br />
You'll only get the 2nd message if the mob still has mana, if its oom you'll only see the first message and it won't be able to gate. <br />
