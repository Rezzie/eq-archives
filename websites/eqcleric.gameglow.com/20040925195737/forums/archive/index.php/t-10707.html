<br />
Is there a level restriction to get in? <br />
<br />
I heard the regen for the gate spell in cost about 250pp?  <br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">11-02-1999, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went in last night.  Supposedly unitemized until tomorrow (?) patch.  Killed a Priest of Inorruuk, and another undead (was madly trying to med to get mana with my head down so I could lag wouldn't interfere).<br />
<br />
There is a level restriction, and the regent costs a lot (not too sure how much- never asked our gater).<br />
<br />
Seemed a lot easier than Fear, but MOBs have some pretty varried abilities.  Spike Golem resisted about 80% of all spells out right, rest got partial resists, even after Tashani.  Hope to go back with a shaman and higher level enchanter next time, but I think he's pretty much melee only.  He also casts an AOE disease spell and has a pet.<br />
<br />
Priest of Inn. complete healed himself during the break from Holy Might and Force after one resist- boy were people pissed.  Oh well, he still fell after that pretty nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halo</div><div class="date">11-03-1999, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went for the first time last night...corpse retrieval is super easy so go in equipped. <br />
The price to get in is a killer about 210-250pp so getting in and out is a real pain. <br />
I figure i had to zone into PoF about 200 times already which would equate to about<br />
40,000-50,000pp to get into PoH. I have no idea where I'm going to get the money for this. Each spectre averages 2pp so I have to kill 100 spectres for one trip.<br />
Anyway, the clerics of Innoruk have the cleric purple armor now. Some nice weapon was dropped but I didn't get details.<br />
You need a wizard just to get there which is a problem...they should let druids have that gate spell too.<br />
Trains occur too often due to huge agro radius in a maze like structure. You pull one and 4 come. Any more than 4 and even a 4 group army will get routed. These critters are tough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not one to continue rumors, but someone on one of the onelist mailing lists said that there was a physical gate to PoH like the one the PoF.<br />
<br />
His clues are:<br />
Who worships him?<br />
Where do they live?<br />
Look around, or rather up!<br />
<br />
Anyone found the physical entrance yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">See my follow up post in Hunting Grounds level 44.  There is another entrance, a physical one, supposedly.  Not too many people have found it yet.<br />
<br />
Both zone points are &quot;safe zones&quot; when you come in.  The gate spell, which costs an ungodly amount of cash, puts you in that little room with the U-turn to the right.  The rumor that I hear is that the physical zone in puts you outside on the streets.<br />
<br />
Check the clues in the hunting section and then look around (and up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doh!  Reread the post that I saw- on caster's realm- here's the clues:<br />
<br />
who is the god<br />
who are his people<br />
which direction do you look when talking to god<br />
<br />
So, I'm thinking DOWN some hole or down the falls in Neriak.  The hunt continues!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lito</div><div class="date">11-05-1999, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for faction... Guess how it felt to see &quot;Your standing with innoruuk got worse&quot; or something after we killed a &quot;cleric of innoruuk&quot;. When I am a follower of Innoruuk and a Cleric myself... Well this game never was designed for roleplayers, or dark elves anyway so... =)<br />
<br />
I forgot what they conned before this factionhit but at least now they are all &quot;Ready to attack&quot;. However when I am in wolfform, all mobs we've encountered so far have been &quot;Warmly&quot; to me... hmm? Any other Innoruuk followers out there who conned anything before the fighting began?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bandayd</div><div class="date">11-16-1999, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand why you high levels (46+) are worried about a measly 250pp to get in.  If you know where to hunt, you can make about 1,500pp in an hour with a group of 3 or about 500pp solo.  Just kill the dwarf NPCs in butcher block.  They always drop a 21pp axe and then the random 0-4pp, along with random FS Weapons (another 5pp or so) and sometimes ringmail. (2pp).  So you are looking at everytime you kill a dwarf you AT LEAST make 21pp to 30pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanaz</div><div class="date">11-29-1999, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On faction. FYI from an interview with GZ.<br />
<br />
Skyshade: One necromancer complaint that I tend to agree with is that your God will attack you on sight. Shouldn't he be at least indifferent to you at first?  Of course, once you attack one of his minions or himself, your faction would be greatly affected. Do you have any plans to change this?<br />
<br />
GZ: Nope. If you walk into chat with the god of Hate, don't expect him to do anything but Hate you. I mean, if you get there, how many of his guards did you just kill (or help kill)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">11-29-1999, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay- Fact:<br />
No walk in gate.  Anywhere. <br />
<br />
In the rumor mill:<br />
...is that they are creating a &quot;safe&quot; spot in Fear to teleport into, so that there will be a little more cash drain on the economy.  Hmmm, is the inside of the fire temple a safe spot?<br />
<br />
Finally ended my zero for 23 streak on cleric pieces last night.  Guess what I got?  Yep, those crazy +5 int boots (13 ac, +5 agi and 7 cold or poison too- but who cares). I'm sticking with efreeti boots until I get a full set of EM, which (in light of my luck) doesn't look like it's going to happen before the expansion.<br />
<br />
At least I ended the streak, right??  WRONG! I also rolled on the next item that came up- bracers which I would love, and I won on those too.  Too bad I decided to take the damn boots.  Funny thing is that I rolled a 100 on the boots (/random 1 100).  I've never rolled 100.  Heck, I've only rolled over 80 once.  The roll on the bracer (Verant's way of teasing me) was an 87.<br />
<br />
Bleck!  Tunare must not deem me worthy of grace yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mufin</div><div class="date">12-15-1999, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone confirm that dark elves aren't KOS in Hate?  Someone told me this and I'm sceptical.<br />
<br />
Also, can someone tell me exactly what the faction hit is, and would it be bad for dark elves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">12-21-1999, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your faction hit is with your God, and yes- anyone who worships Innoruk and has never killing anything there is not KOS (in wolf form for sure).  We have used such a person as a scout for us before.  They usually scout out the pull, lead the puller to it and then make sure that nothing else comes with the pull.<br />
<br />
If you heal someone, cast any offensive spells- other than cancel/nullify magic, or sometimes if you are just too close to the battle you will get faction hits- and it only takes one to go to KOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mufin</div><div class="date">01-13-2000, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally went to PoH.  Awesome zone!  As a worshiper of Innoruk, I was able to roam around and seen as &quot;warmly&quot; by every critter in there (in wolf-form only).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I couldn't not heal my party during fights for the fear of losing faction.  This was frustrating.<br />
<br />
Are their any dark brothers or sisters out there that have ventured in there and done the same thing?  I don't mind scouting, but I'm sure that it's going to get old fast.  Healing's in my blood.   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mufin</div><div class="date">01-13-2000, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;couldn't not&quot;..  doh.  Bad english.  sorry.   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">01-15-2000, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What you have to do is make sure that an enchanter mem blurs it when the MOBS about 1/2 health.   This way you loose no faction.  The reoccuring amniesia spell (spelling?) also is nice  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mufin</div><div class="date">01-18-2000, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atone works just as well on a single mob.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />
