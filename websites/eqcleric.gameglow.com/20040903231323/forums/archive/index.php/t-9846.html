<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juul</div><div class="date">05-23-2000, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taken from a topic on the general board here at EQCleric:<br />
 If everyone is rolling on cleric spell scrolls, so that they can make a hideous profit out of the clerics, why shouldn't we do the same with the other classes? <br />
<br />
What is Norrath coming to?  I remember that people used to help each other, perform random acts of kindness, and just be nice in general - on boards and in the game.  Now it seems like the WarBringer! attitude has infected everyone - ME FIRST, SCREW YOU.  I've already taken Juul and the horse she rode in on and exited stage left because I was sick of the pissing, moaning, bickering and backstabbing going on in my guild, on my server, at my level.  I started over - new server, new character (well, she's a DE cleric instead of a HiE cleric - how's that for a complete change of pace?!!?), and new play style (helllllllo PvP teams!) - but just reading stuff on these, and other, boards depresses the hell out of me.<br />
<br />
EverQuest (NeverQuest, EverNerf, etc) is a game!  Say it with me now.  Close your eyes, let the mantra take over your soul.  Allow memories of the good old days - the first time you saved someone with a split second heal, your first piece of wisdom gear, being chased across a city by an NPC who didn't like you just because you had hairy feet - whatever the good memories are, remember them.  Now, open your eyes (hopefully you read this entirely before closing them!) and consider how you feel.  Now compare that to how you felt after the last time you logged off.<br />
<br />
This is what I did, and I ended up starting completely fresh on a new server.  I have diddly and squat to my level 16 name.  It has been driven home to me that Oasis is a good place for exp, but a bad place to save up for spells.  My greatest accomplishments to date are a Disciple Symbol of Innoruuk and pk'ing a mage who was at least 4 levels above me after she attacked a friend and I.  Ya know what?  That symbol, and the stupid excuse from the mage after she died (&quot;I didn't have my hotkeys set up!&quot;) bring a far greater sense of pride and accomplishment to me than Juul's full set of EM, Dawnfire, Tobrin's, White Dragonscale Cloak, and Aegis of Life put together.<br />
<br />
I actually have fun when I log in now - I'm on a fresh server, untwinked, no higher level cleric char for people to bug me with res requests.  How many of you can honestly say the same?  I don't care about my exp, I don't care about leveling, and equipment is the least of my concerns - the less I have, the less I have to lose.<br />
<br />
I encourage everyone to take a look at what they are doing and why.  If the game isn't fun for you any more, try changing a few things.  If it still isn't fun, cut the cord.  I have the feeling that I am gradually weaning myself off right now - I'm having fun, enjoying the nostalgia of 25hp heals and buffs that wear off in 15 minutes.  Once I've walked far enough down memory lane, it'll be time to call it a night.  If playing EQ is giving you pains in the stomach, I submit that it might be time for you to do the same.  End the game on a good note, don't keep beating the dead horse.  Level 60 isn't a pile of dog doo if you aren't having a good time every step of the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">05-23-2000, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the discrepency exists due to the diversity of situations.<br />
<br />
There are guild groups.<br />
<br />
There are groups of friends.<br />
<br />
There are friendly groups.<br />
<br />
There are pickup groups that hunt in places and agree to the &quot;he who can use it and *will* use it gets to roll&quot; which is ultimately an honor system.<br />
<br />
There are completely random pickup groups in dungeons where it's all roll.<br />
<br />
The handling of each situation is different.  If I go into a dungeon with a friendly group in Kunark then of course, if we find something new and shiney and the paladin can use it, they get it.  hands down, no questions.<br />
<br />
If I go to guk and shout to join the perpetually changing frenzy group, then I expect to be able to roll for the sash.<br />
<br />
I believe folks are simply relating to the types of situations they are experiencing right now or most recently.  But in truth, I think we *all* run into *all* of these situations.<br />
<br />
My thinking is that this is a non-issue and we are debating it from different viewpoints while all agreeing in the larger sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juul</div><div class="date">05-23-2000, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense, Ofbac, but you flew wide of my point.  I'm not talking about what the quote says, I'm talking about *how* it says it.  Compare that to how we, the players of EQ, talked to each other in December.  I'm sure you read more than just the boards on this site - compare them all - the attitude in December versus the attitude now.  Just leave Whineplay over at the Offical Site out of it =P<br />
<br />
Hrm, that kinda brings up a point - when I used to read the Offical EQ Boards, people were friendly and nice.  Name the last post on Whineplay that was &quot;good&quot; in nature, but not a satire of Gordon's 3rd nipple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimette</div><div class="date">05-23-2000, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been in pickup groups almost exclusively, and I've found the one way to get attention in them lately :<br />
<br />
Something nice drops (FBSS, Yak, Mithral 2 hander etc) and the rolls start up - <br />
<br />
Type /em won't roll<br />
<br />
People stare at you like you just grew a third eye, and switched your default language to Lower Penguin.<br />
<br />
It's now assumed that it's open season on everything, because all of a sudden people are looking for trade stuff for the impressive Kunark Loot.<br />
<br />
Last night was one of the better ones; We helped a 40th Paladin break the Shin Lord room in Upper, while Clem and I nipped off to the Supplier to try for a soiled sack.<br />
<br />
We stayed grouped, because with 4 people in Upper and a dozen in lower, we wanted someone to chat with.<br />
<br />
Eventually, we were asked to help break Magi and we eventually moved to Lord in a group of 6, three of whom (including the Paladin) had never been past the bloodpool.<br />
<br />
Third cycle, Lord pops with a Yak. Everyone rolls, except me, and the Paladin is the current leader with a 63. (lots of low rolls).<br />
<br />
I announced I didn't want it, rolled for fun, and scored a 86. That Paladin was rather happy, and I'm sure he won't be out to gouge me if he comes across any cleric spells falling from the sky in the future.<br />
<br />
With the Kunark fever dying down, a few self-sacrificing deeds here and there, coupled with a few subtle hints e.g. 'First drop is for people who can use it, then open roll ?' can only help get things back towards an even keel.<br />

<br />
This isn't about loot distribution, it's about how we treat other people and feel about the game.  Stop talking about loot.  This is my rant, and that isn't what I'm ranting about.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimette</div><div class="date">05-24-2000, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I'm pointing out that some of us still go 'Loot's not important - here, have fun' and arn't greedy SOB's with a &quot;Me First, Screw You&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
The loot in my example wasn't the sole point - it's an example of what us clerics can do to promote polite, fun gameplay - <br />
1) Helping him clear his room <br />
2) Keeping him in our group after we zoned, just to give him someone to chat with<br />
3) Introducing him to a new area that he hadn't been in, (and providing a running commentary)<br />
4) As well as getting him a sword.<br />
<br />
It makes no difference if it's a Yak, if it's a Bronze Rapier from that Derv, or if it's the cheerful/amusing groupsays - spread them out to the people who need them. If you notice the group getting silent and dour, that's the time to try to lighten the mood.<br />
<br />
Clerics can be a moral focus, diplomat, entertainer and general-mood-improver as well as a source of hitpoints. <br />
<br />
And if you see a member of the group heading down the wrong path, well mild suggestions will always carry more weight from us then from the Troll Warrior, after all.<br />
<br />
Although I suppose a Troll Warrior may have other weight on their side.<br />

I have noticed that usually the next time around, a few other group members may not roll, and at least during that group, they only roll for what they need (not the same as can use).<br />
<br />
Slowly, I see the attitude changing, at least in the pick-up groups I'm in.  Perhaps people are remembering that I only roll on what I need (which is very little now, I worked damn hard to get my quest armour solo).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanar</div><div class="date">05-24-2000, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted that message playing devil's advocate.<br />
<br />
The point I was trying to put across is that if a cleric scroll drops in Kunark, if there are clerics in the group that need it, they should roll for it.<br />
<br />
The same with any other scroll.  If the group make a point of having everyone roll for the scroll, I have seen no reasonable argument as to why the cleric should not roll for the other items.  Sometimesgroup members ask for hp buffs all the time, without offering a reagent or recompense for the cost of the reagent. (especially when you know they don't need it)<br />
<br />
If I buff an enchanter with the HP buff, however, I do not expect or even ask for recompense from them.  The bonus from having an enchanter staying alive outweigh the costs.<br />
<br />
Personally, I need all the cash I can get to pay for jaspers, and I know this is going to get more expensive when I get onto peridots.<br />
<br />
With a CHA of 45, it is very expensive for me to buy and sell.  I do have a few CHA items, but I do not carry them all the time, as sometimes I do need to run away from things.<br />
<br />
If the tone of my argument was too strong, I apologise.  I did not intend the post to appear to be a flame.</div></div><hr />
