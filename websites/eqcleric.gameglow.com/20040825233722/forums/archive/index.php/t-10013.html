<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SleepyBhr</div><div class="date">06-17-2002, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was going to meet a friend and help him with part of a quest in Erud's Crossing.  So, I went to hope the boat from Erudin...<br />
<br />
I got on the skiff and went to the boat.  The boat left the arbor at about the same time the skiff left the dock, so I had to wait for the next boat.<br />
<br />
When the next boat came (an agony of waiting), as soon as it pulled up I steped forward... and was turned around and dumped into the harbor.  There was *no* chance at all of my getting on the boat.  And there was a shark in the harbor to boot.<br />
<br />
I reported the bug (feedback form), petitioned, and logged out.  <br />
<br />
I was very upset.  I had waited a very long time in the game for a boat, which annoyed me to no end.   I avoid public transportation in real life becuase I don't like waiting 20 minutes for a bus/train.  And it was completely broken, to boot, so all my waiting and I'm still trapped on that continent.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't have minded so much if they had their message of the day when you log in be something useful: like &quot;the boat from Odus is broken.&quot;  Instead thay have a message whoring their new service of name changing.  Or if they changed the message the mythical harbor master says to &quot;You are out of luck, /join taxi:taxi and beg for a port in Toxxulia Forest.&quot;  I might noy have noticed it, but then it woudl just have been my fault for not paying attention.<br />
<br />
I'm growing to hate boat rides a lot in EverQuest.  They can interesting the first time, but in general they are long, drawn out, and boring.  Waiting 20 minutes or so for a slow boat is just way too painful.  I'd rather more slowly swim the entire way -- unsow'd -- just to relieve the bordom, but then you  can't zone while not in a boat.  Aren't video games supposed to be interesting and fun without having to resort to /gems?<br />

You need to petition for a port to Qeynos.<br />
<br />
and it would be nice if they told you that, I agree.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ancarett</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate the boats. I take the boats all the time. Siiiiigh. I think it would probably be useful to bind myself in the firepot room, given the headaches boat travel causes me.<br />
<br />
Between the long waits and the bugged boats, travelling in EQ is a pain. Porters for hire seem to operate mostly in the evening ET zone, whereas I usually log on during the day to move my characters from one spot to another.<br />
<br />
The other day my husband (who plays a warrior) suggested we go hunt at the Tower. We were doing the boring pickup group thing in DL and I agreed with him that the Tower would be more fun, but had to say no. Why? No porters could be found at the moment. I have a druid who can port him around, but he doesn't have a high enough porter on his account, so I'd have to take three boats (or two boats and one enormous swim) to get there. No way I could do that and still have playtime the same night. Siiiigh.<br />

It's far from perfect, but if you have luclin for that situation you could have ported up from the dl spires and down to great divide....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SleepyBhr</div><div class="date">06-20-2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Update on the boat from Erudin: not only does the boat fail to work, but levitate fails and dumps you in the water.  &quot;Sink like a stone,&quot; said a necro friend of mine.  So much for jumping the shark...<br />
<br />
After helping a friend in Erud's Crossing by giving him a rez and keeping him company for the Test of Patience (like the boats aren't enough), I gated back to my bind point in Timorous Deep on a spire.  (Ah... felt like coming home.)  There was a woman there who was ooc'ing that the boat from Firiona Vie had done something weird and dumped her on and island somewhere.  The place it dumped her was the island with the chess board, which as you may know if due West of the Island where the boat stops at the elven outpost.  Really weird.  She had been trapped there for some time, since she didn't know where she was and didn't have a map or anything.  (I gave her directions and wished her well.  Probably should have escorted her, too.  Ah well.)<br />
<br />
So... boat weirdness abound.  I'll say it again: I *really* want to be able to zone without being in a boat.  It's only fair when the foul things break so often and are so slow when they do.<br />
<br />
And underwater is way to dark now.  Verrant should learn that it really is no fun if you can't see anything.<br />

Mine will run those zones but spottily. I have gone LD zoning into/out of Nexus more times than I care to count.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am free of the boats for a bit. Paid a kind druid to port my butt out of the dreadlands and I'm now camped in Innothule Swamp, hanging out near my home away from home, Lower Guk (dead side).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gayl</div><div class="date">06-30-2002, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never take a boat and for a long time did not have easy access to a druid or wizard, but always got ports when I wanted one.<br />
<br />
If I was not in any big hurry, I would offer 10pp in ooc or shout, if nothing came of it, no big deal.<br />
The closer I was getting to time that I wanted to be somewhere else, the more I would raise the amount offered. 50pp will always get you a port almost instantly.<br />
<br />
Granted, at lower levels you may not have that kind of pp. In that case you really don't have the option to be where you want, when you want.<br />
<br />
ancarett, you sound like one of the lucky ones, having two accounts.<br />

For the first two years of EQ it was his account, but I weaseled my way into playing on occasion and finally got my own account last spring.<br />
<br />
Now if I can only get my husband's druid up from level 18 to where he can port me places. Then I'll be one happy cleric!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cobra101</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boats seem to be broken quite a lot. I don't have the plat to be casually paying 30pp (seems the going rate on our server) just to save time so I use them to get to Freeport. My computer has a worrying glitch where most of the boat disappears under you which makes it even more fascinating. <br />
<br />
The Maiden's Voyage (kunark boat) is still broken but I hate Kunark anyway and GM's will port if petitioned.<br />
<br />
But the boats that really, really annoy me are the skiffs in OOT (or possibly anywhere). They just won't seem to cross a zero coordinate. I've reported it and been told &quot;just wait&quot;. After 30 mins in a small boat I got off and swam. I've had this on reaching zero going east-west and north-south. After a few abortive attempts I just swim now (unless I can get levi  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif)<br />
<br />
I don't think the MOTD would be long enough. You need a /boat command that lists which - if any - are still working.</div></div><hr />

Bind in or near the firepot room in Tim Deep!  Never take a boat again!  <br />
