<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yelien</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just dinged 14 last night (woot! new spells!) and i quickly ran out of my money buy my spells( didnt even get them all).  I bought a few cats eye but i dont want to waste 2gp just for buffs, so i was wondering what are your suggestions on when to symbol and when to not, and who to symbol and who to not?  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Symbol everyone when breaking a room. Always.<br />
<br />
Symbol enchanters in your group. Always.<br />
<br />
When in doubt, symbol. Always. (You can never have too many hps, imo) If it turns out that most people aren't being hit too often, you can let the symbols fade. But if in doubt, cast it.<br />
<br />
Once you get higher levels, the regent cost will becomes less of an issue, altho it never goes away. At level 51, I rarely use my best symbol outside of planes/dragons, but I use my second best one much more frequently since the regent cost is much more of a bargain. (11 plat vs 8 gold)<br />
<br />
It's something of an art, balancing your pocketbook vs. the group hps, but after a time, you'll get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
Example- If your group is a barbarian warrior, half elf rogue, mage and yourself. After each fight, assuming proper tactics are used, the mage is at 3/5 health, the warrior at 2/5 and the rogue at half, I would symbol the rogue and mage. A caster at 3/5 is virtually critical while a warrior at 2/5 can stand by for a while longer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Symbols start off low in hps and gradiually build upto their maximum after around 5 levels.  Therefore you will not see much real benifit from the symbols until you are level 19 (likewise the level 24 symbol does not justify the 3x the cost for 20 more hps but it gets better by around 29).<br />
<br />
Secondly knowing who to symbol when is an art.  Sometimes having that symbol will save someone sometimes it won't and the mana you saved casting it saves someone's elses life.<br />
<br />
From personel experience the only people who warrant agressive buffing are those in high risk roles.  That is crowd controllers (be it enchanter, necro or yourself if you are fulfilling that role) and the puller.  When you get higher in level then using symbols is a good way of increasing your mana efficiency with complete heal (but you have a bit of a way to go for that).<br />
<br />
At level 14 a cleric is a high risk job.  This increases and decreases based on whether or not you are grouped with a chanter and that mobs can be mezzed (later on not all can be).  If they can be mezzed then healing becomes fairly safe, if not then it can be downright lethal.<br />
<br />
Wizards, magicians, necros (when not doing crowd control), druids &amp; shamans (when not healing) rogues (debatable....aint had enough practice here to know if evade warrants giving them lower level buffs) and to a certain extent secondary tanks warrant lower level buffs because they should not be taunting much and if they do its their own fault (although whether or not a ranger taunting so much is their fault is again debatable.  Some say they can not help it if doing their job correctly, some say they can).<br />
<br />
At your level whilst it might be a bit mean it's not a good idea to let people get away with sloppy play.  If a nuker over nukes on a serious mob (I have over nuked when playing around) then they are doing something wrong and a death or too will help them in the long run (as it helps clerics to learn when to heal so not to taunt).  I did once meet a really daft 45+ wizard who thought the tanks were being a bit crap when they couldnt out taunt him dumping all of his mana into nukes at the start of the fight.<br />
<br />
How someone got their level with that type of mentality I never know.<br />
<br />
The best idea is to experiment.  learn who needs them and who does not.  Learn by making mistakes (best done early really).  I am a firm believer that there is only so much that can be taught by words alone.  After that you have to get in and get dirty.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />
