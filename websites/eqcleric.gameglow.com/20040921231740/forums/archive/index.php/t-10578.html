Lower guk is still a bit too tough for me.. so I'd like to put that off for a few more levels.. and I don't want to hunt mammoth's in everfrost because I'm a dark elf and can't bank in halas (i'm kos).  I've heard that the druids in west commons (or was it west karana?) are very good exp but I haven't tried them yet.<br />
<br />
But is unrest worth going back to?  Once again I can't go there for the loot (except rare stuff like dwarven workboots, etc) because I can't bank any plat, etc.  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions are appriciated.<br />

<br />
Unrest is where it's AT!  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif hehe I've been there since 26 now for my XP expeditions and you make killer xp there.  Made it through 29 in a night, actually basically a level per night from 26 - 29.. about 6-7 hrs each.. haven't worked at 30 yet much as I've been gathering new equip! i.e. +6 wis rings, epolets, gaterscale leg's.. hehe.. still trying for that charred guardian shield though...  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif... <br />
<br />
But people make it through 30 in 2 nights in unrest and 31-35 is quite easy to do there too.. after 35 it's Lower Guk for me.. but gunna stay in unrest to 34 at least, mebbe 35... lotsa cool loot too, small bronze and words you find you can sell for PP and just dump all yoru gold, cp, sp etc and only keep pp and the rare loot BS Tunic, DWB etc...<br />
<br />
Loving it!  Clerics rock there too!  Are almost always needed, dismiss undead kicks arse and for the werebats/fungus's wrath takes care of those too.. you can also solo there if for some reason no groups around or you don't have time to group...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, just my good rant on Unrest.. hehe come over and I'll group with ya fersure!  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
See ya online!<br />

<br />
Torture room is all blue/even, in ghost room you'll see blue to yellow with ghost at red. Also, if you're feeling frisky, the pit has some more high blue/even/yellow for ya. Real fast xp.<br />

At level 30 start camping the blood pool and ghost room and the experience is really good if you stick to a full group of 30 to 35s.  My friend actually took his level 30 warrior to 36 in 4 days simply camping the boots.  Things con blue but with the repeative pulls from the pit below and up in the hall you get really excellent experience.  I don't know if this matters but I found I got a lot more experience if I threw in an undead DD spell for each mob.  I hope this makes sense...I've just come out of a 19 hour Bilge camp. =)</div></div><hr />
