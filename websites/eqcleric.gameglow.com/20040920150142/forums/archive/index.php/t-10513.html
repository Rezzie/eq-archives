I cannot walk freely in most towns, and definitely cannot step foot in Firiona Vie.<br />
<br />
So it's a long haul to get to the Lake of Ill Omen.  Does anyone have any suggestions for a level 20 Teir`Dal Cleric?<br />
<br />
I'm currently chillin in Unrest, but find it rather lacking...and a LONG way from friendly territory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Find the River and go up it (be careful of the spider things), start up it on the left and when you get to the hill (water fall type area) cross the river right, zone in (you might end up in the water when zoning), then cross back to the left and follow it up to the Lake.  On the left side following the Lake shore you will get nice experience.  <br />
<br />
If you have a balanced group go further inland away from the zone line.  If you stay to the left from the zone, over the ruins, and to the windmill, that is an excellent place to pull things to. There are Sarnacks, crusaders (and other Iksar), goblins, and Tigers to pull.  Plus the Wm has a merchant inside  :o)<br />
<br />
Safe journey to thee  :o)<br />
<br />
PS: I made level 24 moving up into this forum.<br />
