With a pick-up group, it seems to stink with my death/XP ratio.  I have heard of soloing in unrest at this lvl range (22) on the first floor from back door and side door.  Is this really a rational option?  If so please give me some details on your experiences.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klang</div><div class="date">12-15-1999, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After 3 or 4 weeks of ups and downs in unrest, I finally said enough.  I was tired of playing russian roullete with grouping.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I would group with smart people and get exp, but other times i would group with dumb or unreliable people and die.<br />
<br />
Im level 21 and I decided to attempt soloing in unrest.  I decided to keep sow on at all times and only go inside when i was near fom. <br />
<br />
I invised myself and went in the house and looked around.  I tried to find targets that conned blue and which were not too near to any other nasties.<br />
<br />
I also promised myself if I felt threatened at all I would zone.  I decided its better to be safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
Well soloing went well (is that a good sentence? hehe).  I would nuke and melee the target to death then leave house and med.<br />
<br />
The last two night I've made 2 1/2 bubbles and Im not tweaked at all.  Im poor and barely getting by in regards to money.<br />
<br />
I had a druid friend message me and I joined with him last night some.  I did this (1) because I liked him and (2) free sow.  I would recommend grouping with a druid if the opportunity presents itself. <br />
<br />
I also let another level 20 cleric group with me and the druid which also worked well.  I would recommend that you never turn away a cleric and always have someone who can cast sow in your group.<br />
<br />
The cleric later had a monk friend who he wanted to let join so he joined us as well. <br />
<br />
When this group was formed they suggested we do the standard pull from the house routine. I said no to the idea and told them we go in together invised and sowed.<br />
<br />
They said ok, but had they not agreed, I felt no pressure to conform since I knew I could solo.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I would recommend that you give soloing a try but also be open to grouping with people who you trust and are helpful to you.  <br />
<br />
I would recommend against the standard pull from the house routine unless you have alot of trust and confidence in the puller.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klang</div><div class="date">12-15-1999, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two night ago is when I soloed the most and the first floor was full of undead. However, I was still able to find undead that were alone that I could attack without being ganged up on.  I didnt look to see how many people were in unrest on that night.<br />
<br />
Last night was packed and there were over 70 people in unrest.  Last night was when I grouped with 3 other people and we went in the house together.<br />
<br />
The first floor was empty so we went to the second floor right by the fireplace and had a blast.  The house was so full of players that I ran around the first and second floor hoping to see some undead.<br />
<br />
With so many people in unrest the monsters never got a chance to gang up on us and we did really well.<br />
