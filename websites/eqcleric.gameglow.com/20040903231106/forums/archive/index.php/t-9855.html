<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Osbern</div><div class="date">06-20-2000, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Logged on last night at dreadlands just outside Karnor's castle, and was about to ask if anyone was teleporting to Lavastorm when I get a tell from a paladin asking if I can rez someone in Karnor zone. &quot;Sure&quot; I said<br />
&quot;let me med up a bit&quot;. She said alright and was dragging corpse of her friend to zone area closest to me. I told her after a couple minutes I was zoning in, get an ok, so in I go. I knew things were bad when I hear my bones crunching before the zone even completely loaded, and my first view was of my corpse swarmed with mobs.<br />
 I tell her I died and she said sorry there was a train, &quot;no problem&quot;, I said &quot;comes with the territory.&quot;<br />
 Now the annoying part: After the train is cleared I zone in and ask the paladin whose corpse needed the rez, she says &quot;Oh you are only 46 level?&quot; Now I never go anon so this irked me. They ended not being able to find a 49 rez, so I rezzed the wizard and refused payment out of spite. Rant over.<br />

<br />
Lately I've seen a lot of this.<br />
<br />
To the point where I got a tell from a 47 cleric in the same situation you were in (cleric and others dead and they were telling their cleirc he was not good enough to res them).   So I ressed the cleric, told them all farewell and left.<br />
<br />
After all of the times I was abused in my 40s I won't help those that act snobbishly to their clerics.  A pack of mid/low 40s acting snobbish about not getting a 49 res.  Yeah, they get my sympathy.<br />
<br />
I could hear the sorrow and despair comming out of the poor cleirc as he was told that he was not good enough.  <br />
<br />
I'm also a bit tired of every 35th and up character wanting on 49th resses.  You may have 50+ alts and be used to getting 49th res but if you are 40 and hunting with 40 cleirc then you should be DARN HAPPY to get the 39th res and shut up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best thing ever said to me in that situation?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, cool, thanks!&quot;<br />

<br />
Spent all weekend in Fear, the only cleric there for about 20 of the the 42 hours we were on plane.<br />
<br />
I ate 11 Death Touches, died a few times while checking on the state of the camps, and was killed once in combat. Five of my deaths had no resses due to naked corpses or running out the time limit. Total XP loss for the weekend was close to three post-50 bubbles.<br />
<br />
There was a level 47 cleric and a level 48 up with us at one point. People were refusing rescuscitations from them, which slowed down the process and made them feel terrible.<br />
<br />
Finally I let the zone know that I had passed on ressing myself to get the raids back on track and had very little sympathy for a druid or necromancer who died once while on their loot plane.<br />
<br />
My mind is still boggled at some people's perception of my role in their gameplay...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">06-22-2000, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally sympathize with you Osbern.  It's the reason why I go anon nowadays and only accept rez requests from friends or people that I know.  (I also only cast symbol on only the same group of people; stranger = risking never getting return for services)  You never see a shammy or druid get asked for a SoW, then get turned down because he/she's not of a higher level.  Nor do you ever see an enchanter under level 29 get turned down for a breeze.  You'd think that with the shortages of clerics with the ability to rez, people would accept anything that they could get.  It's just silly in my book.<br />
