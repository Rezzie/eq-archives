<br />
1)You have to actually land the blow for it to have a chance to go off. WHat do you think the average 50+ Necro's skill is in 2HB? My guess would be around 35 (that is if they used 2hb at all). Int caster's arent like us, practicing weapon skills and defense is so difficult that it isn't worth the effort after level 14.<br />
<br />
2)How much INT does a level 50+ Necro lose when he equips this? Probably 15-20;<br />
<br />
3)What do you think happens to the Necro if he's in melee range of the mob and that staff actually did proc once or twice? You guessed it, dead Necro.<br />
<br />
4)It drops off the Dracoliche. Planar items are supposed to be powerful. This one isn't, its a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The staff was recently changed I think, but how or to what, I don't know.<br />
<br />
That version of the staff has been around since Fear went live.<br />

The old version proc'ed an undead charm spell and was utterly useless.  The new proc is definitely better, but I wouldn't start crying about it.<br />

Putting a weapon in a necro's hands is even more laughable as one in a cleric's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malachite</div><div class="date">07-29-2000, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually seen this put to good use. Necro w/ clarity two casts DOTs on the undead mob then whacks it with the staff for his nukes while standing behind the tank. Never even had to heal him  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif Plus they have that random proc spell that does ab out 70 dmg + Banish = some nice extra damage and w/ clarity 2 they're FM or close at the end of the battle anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frumpalicious</div><div class="date">07-30-2000, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Staff isn't all that worthless, you don't have to land a blow for a weapon to process.  Trust me, I do it all the time with my dawnfire.  Also a LOT of your old school necros have this weapon just laying around in their vaults because it was a huge booby prize on dracoliche and people really just threw them around to their friends and whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Albrecht Hammerfell</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why couldnt they add that effect to the Warhammer of Divine Disgrace? Perhaps they like that people give this dragon loot to thier pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BAH - let the Necros have their stick.<br />
<br />
Shyloc has a good point - How many Necros have you seen running around with a 2HB weapon? Personally I have only seen 2HB on newbie Necros.<br />

<br />
He says he'll put Swift like the Wind, werewolf form, and buff his INT.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Hehehe, like enchanters didn't get kilt enough as it is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You do know that Necros get all the same Anti-undead spells we get, right??<br />

All or almost all of the blighted armor pieces have dex on them, and you don't need to hit the mob to proc - effect goes off on misses just as well. With wonderous rapidity and dexterity buff from shaman, the necro was proc'ing fairly often  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif And vampiric embrace (which taps ~70 points for her) helped heal her.</div></div><hr />
