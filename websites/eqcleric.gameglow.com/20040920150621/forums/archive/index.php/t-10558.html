Find you way to the feerott zone, then head back into the zone and take the first left. This area is Necro valley and has a bone tower on the left wall with two gnome necros. Unless you have a full group, stay away from them.<br />
<br />
The undead camp is also on the left and past the bone tower, you will see some ruins there. There are at least a dozen spawns in this area. I usually clear it from right to left. At this level you need at least one tank and one nuker two for the tougher skeletons.<br />
<br />
Half of the spawns will be green to you but the Giant skeletons, Barbed Boned Skeletons and Skeletal Monks will give you xp all thru these levels. The higher in levels you get the fewer groupmates you will need and if you have jboots you can solo this camp fairly well.<br />
<br />
It's a fairly safe camp, I've never gotten trained there even though it is next to, and connected to, Giant Valley. Having a shaman or druid with you for Sow is great for when you pull three giant skeletons at once, but you can usually escape with DA.<br />

He is alot tougher then a normal giant skellie so be careful. He spawns in the center so pulling  from the outside should not cause him to pop. <br />
Best of Luck</div></div><hr />
