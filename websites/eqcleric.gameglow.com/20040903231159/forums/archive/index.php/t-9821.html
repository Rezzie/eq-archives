<br />
-Having a dot happy shaman and a good enchanter in the group (Dammit, why doesn't mes stick?!)<br />
<br />
-A druid that tries to kite in a dungeon (gee, don't mobs jump over holes???)<br />
<br />
-A monk that practices instill doubt in Mistmoore (kudos for the biggest train I ever saw. And I survived it too.)<br />
<br />
-A 'my pet can solo Nafagen' type of necromancer pulling (don't ask, just don't ask)<br />
<br />
-A bard that just can't shut up (what do you mean, my song cancels inv. to undead?)<br />
<br />
-A level 50 cleric that wears leather and specialises in evocation. (ON ME!HEAL ME NOW!...gee really)<br />
<br />
I'm sure you'll think of few more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Players in South Karana asking folks to leave a certain type of MOB alone (avocets) because that is all they can kill for XP anymore....PUH-LEEZE<br />
<br />
- Players walking up to a shaman/druid and simply saying 'sow', then angrily cursing the shaman/druid when they are refused (saw this last night in East Commons at the bazaar).<br />
<br />
- Players walking up to my ogre shaman hunting partner's PET and asking for SoW, then stomping off angrily (un-SoWed) while we laugh our butts off.<br />

<br />
Boy did I have a good laugh at that one...hasnt happened to me much lately.<br />
<br />
I almost wish I had sow...because he definitly earned it from an entertainment perspective.</div></div><hr />

Never tried it yet though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Using a DE SK in SolA as the puller for gnomes when you hear this phrase &quot;Whats this castle down here and whats 11 clockworks doing here all alone? Uh oh, invis is ou-&quot;<br />
<br />
-Having a wizzie of all classes pull in SolA<br />
<br />
-Finding a dead lvl 4 cleric in full cleric armor and offering a revive and getting the reply &quot;no thanks&quot; while the corpse decays<br />
<br />
The non-sarcastic happiness list<br />
<br />
-Taking that newly lvl 9 cleric into Felwithe and twinking her out with her new spells, some new armor and wis items, buffing her, and sending her on their way for no reason other than they didn't ask you for buffs, money, or items<br />
<br />
-Watching that bastard that ks'd you 14 levels ago die then ask for a rez (oh, how I love that one...)<br />
<br />
-Reviving that very same bastard to prove that you are a nice person and hold no grudges, but will still never help them<br />
<br />
-Taking 9 clockworks in SolA with only 3 tanks, 1 cleric, 1 necro, and 1 druid, of which no one dies and everyone gets a melatite or duffrinite loot.<br />
<br />
-Getting tells for revives/rezzes and them actually being polite about it<br />
<br />
-Turning down payment for revives<br />
<br />
-Doing random buffing/heals/power leveling/revives/etc<br />
<br />
-Dying to save someone and being thanked at least once<br />
<br />
-Buying something for 500pp, trading it, and selling the trade for 1500pp<br />
<br />
-Being a cleric!<br />

<br />
Watching your friend use Illusion:Troll and charming a wolf...then seeing people ask him for SOW!<br />
<br />
Shouting to the zone as you see a druid kiting your guards that &quot;Sone high level shaman needs to come get their pet!  They need to keep this bitch in line or on a leash!&quot;<br />
<br />
Following with the argument that you think it's funny that the druids greatest accomplishement is to gain the ability to transform into a shamans pet!</div></div><hr />

Seeing some poor 16th level or so newbie with leather armor and a crummy sword's body - and using resurrect on them.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
2.  Buffing same newbie and including symbol, because they didn't ask you.<br />
<br />
3.  On Bertox, couple nights ago, I got the single nicest request for a rez I've ever received.  The guy was eloquent, polite, and respectful.  I rezzed him and buffed the holy hell out of him too.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
4.  Seeing that (sorry, no offense to present non-ks'ing druids and shamen) bastard 50th level-forever shaman who trained you long ago get his comeuppance, and desperately need a rez.  Better yet, his freaking druid twink.  Mwahahahahaha.</div></div><hr />
