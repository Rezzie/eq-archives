I spent last night entirely in Rathe Mountains hunting Giant Skeletons and Cyclops.  I could solo Giant Skeletons with plenty of mana to spare (using the root and nuke method). When I got my group, I was the second lowest at level 28.  The highest member was level 30.  Nothing we killed failed to give all the group members experience.  Giant skeletons go up to about level 30, Cyclops up to about Level 31-32.<br />
<br />
As an unexpected bonus, we discovered that there has been a significant increase in Deepwater Goblin Pets in Lake Rathe.  These all /conned blue to me at Level 28.  While they tend to be pack animals (thus a group is recommended) they spawn very quickly.  The few minutes we were in Lake Rathe zone before zoning to Rathe Mountains, we all also got experience.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunt to all!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thormael</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also currently mainly hunting in Rathe Mountains and Lake Rathe Zone. I'm 28 right now but was 27 when I started.<br />
At 27 I was grouping and we were taking cyclops and giant skeletons. Cyclops are tougher but can be done grouping. I was able to solo skels at 27, the toughest of them being real close. I was using the tank and nuke method : nuke the skel to pull it and then melee it (yes press thjat attack button) and dismiss as much as I can do. On the thoughest ones I had a couple resists on dismiss and had to use lower level spells to finish them off, even had to melee a couple of times (my Wis is low but my AC is good so I save mana not rooting the MOB). All skels were blue to me at 27, but I'm pretty sure the highest ones are 26. The lowest ones are 21 or 22.<br />
I also tried deepwater goblin pets near the zone, but on the other side, in Lake Rathe. They're blue and easy to kill. Their masters summon them again when killed so spawn time is not a problem. I'm using ward summoned at 28, fighting them with a monk and they hardly ever turn on me (I nuke non stop). At 29 I'll be able to use expulse summon which will be better. I think they can also be solo'd.<br />
In either cases I found it better to team with a tank so that we could get a new MOB before me being FM and &quot;wasting&quot; mana. Be sure to kill all the lizards and bears in the mountains (they are placeholders for giant skels and cyclops).<br />

Once the spawn is broken up, its great.   There are Giant Skellies, Skeletal Monks, Barb Bones (and the occasional Darkened Giant Skellie) and some low level stuff that you will also have to kill to get the goodies to spawn. I don't suggest soloing here to break up the spawn. But the Feerrott zone is very close by, so if things get out of control, then its a quick run to the zone.</div></div><hr />
