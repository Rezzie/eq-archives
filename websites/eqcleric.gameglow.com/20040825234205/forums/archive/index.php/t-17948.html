<br />
Infinite Alliance is currently recruiting clerics! (60-65). <br />
<br />
IA is a guild filled with friends who have a common goal of making the game more enjoyable for themselves and the other members. We are interested in the player’s personality above all other things (classes, levels, etc). As a family, we help each other out, often putting others before yourself. No selfish people need apply. (WBM) “We before Me” is our motto and we stand behind it!  <br />
<br />
We consider ourselves a progressive family guild overall with moderate raiding. We currently raid between 3-4 days a week. Sometimes more. Our timezone is primarily US pacific with a healthy amount of central and eastern thrown in for good measure. Guild prime time tends to start at 5pm pacific/ 8pm eastern and at earlier times on weekends. Our raid targets  range anywhere from epic mobs, pop flagging, all the way up to tier 3 mobs and more. You can see what we have been up to lately on our website : <br />

<br />
<br />
Most of our members are working adults but we welcome mature players of all ages. Our current minimum level for recruits is 60. Average level of the guild is 60 and we prefer you be level 60 or more or be making a real effort to level. We do not have minimum time requirements as most of our members have real life commitments that must understandably come first. Raiding is not mandatory. Raid experience is not a necessity, feel free to learn with us. But please be willing to learn.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If we sound like the kind of home you have been looking for please feel free to visit our website linked above and apply . You can also post on our message boards http://pub117.ezboard.com/bdpreform if you would like to come on some raids with us, just say hiyas or have any other questions. <br />
