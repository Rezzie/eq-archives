</FONT><HR>Thistleburr, clerics can solo quite effectively through the low 50's.  Its not easy like a druid, but certainly doable.  I have earned easily more than half my XP going solo from level 35 until now, at 54.  I didn't even seek out undead.  Not particulary slow XP either, just lonely.  I did this largely because I mostly have tiny play times, making grouping difficult.   <P>I think the healing changes for druids and shamans is generally good.  I would like to see clerics "balanced" by slightly improving their soloing or utility abilities.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Wow....alot of replies <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>To be honest, Derwen put alot of my opinions right out there in reguards to this issue, but I will still respond to those that posted after me.  <P>Grimdoom-------<P>Point 1: You're citing cleric class issues for reasons not to improve a druid's.  It's not our fault VI chose to improve us first, but I'm sure your time will come.  When it does, I promise you will get very few complaints from the other classes.  The sacrifice druids make is the fact that we are not the best at anything imparticular.  Trust me, it is a real pain at times not being the best, especially post 50.<P>Point 2:  I cannot argue with that.  I would never play a cleric if I had the choice.  But that goes for any class.  I would play any of the melee classes over a warrior, or any of the casting classes over a wizard.  I like variety in my class.  I'm just uncertian what you expected a cleric to be able to do when you created him.  I made my druid almost 2 years ago, when very little was known about the game.  I enjoyed the healing ability up until lvl 40 or so, when all of a sudden, I was unable to fill a role that I had been able to do for the past 40 levels.  It's certianly nice to be back on par for the course.<P>Malloc------<P>Yes, friend, I do see your point.  What I don't understand is how some clerics are certian they will be replaced, while others basically laugh at the idea.  There dosen't seem to be a middle area of thought.  It is one extreme or the other. You desire better soloing abilities in preperation for your class not being needed as much.  I applaud any enhancements you will get in this reguard, not because druids and shaman will be taking your place as healers, but just to add more variety to your class.<P>Allexia-------------<P>In reguards to tunnel vision:  Someone said at the druid board that it's like having a ton of food, when people are dying of thirst <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I thought that was a pretty good way of putting it. We could have every ability in the game, but healing is what is lacking post 50.<P>Your argument is similar to the warrior complaints of old in reguards to other melee class enhancements <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  No offense, but why should clerics be the only healers 50+?  I see no real reason other than "you earned it".  I apologize if this reads wrong, but what makes you think you had an easier time than anyone else achieving high levels?  As to why are we choosing healing as our focus?  Well, to be honest, that is the only thing wrong with our class.  If these changes go live, VI need never look at our class again.  We will have the same power, in the same areas, at 60 that we had at 30.  That is class balance.  Healing is essential post 50, and quite frankly, it is severly lacking.  VI is killing 2 birds with one stone here.  Perhaps that is why we were addressed before clerics.  I am uncertian.<P>I'm sorry you feel as though all us druid and shaman are whiners.  You have to understand that we played 40 levels as a viable healer, then that part of our class was eliminated.  This was a legitimate concern and it did require attention.  Hopefully this will also give us druids a chance to contribute in high end encounters.  <P>Derwen------------<P>Way to lay it on the line.  Hehe, my brother is a lvl 58 cleric and sometimes he looks at my druid with envious eyes.  But he knows he is still "da man" when it comes to healing.  He is very happy with his cleric and his defined role, as I am with mine (with the changes on test).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well as far as spells and class abilities are concerned I can't argue with you on the upgrades on a Druid side Vs a Cleric side. Fixing Root to not break when the damage was applied was a amasing change for the druid class so many more ways of playing opened up on that one change alone. <P>Now making it so the Snare and root stacked now there is something overpowered. Heck I can practically go to sleep while I root and rot now. Heck My wife now fears them while they are rooted and snared then start to blast away not concerned if the root breaks or not. something I wouldn't be surpriced to recieve the nerf stick, even though Absor said there was nothing wrong with it heck they said there was nothing wrong with the Donal's BP.<P>Then you have the fix of the 29 Ensnare spell so that it does break like a root breaks, oh body was that a happy day. Never memed snare again. Now we can track blues down instead of hoping it isn't yellow red or egade green, ewww keep em away.<P>Compared to the Clerics spell and ability upgrades which were... ummm ummm you right no upgrades from what was recieved as a base package. Now yall did recieve Donals yes we have Elder Spirit Armor but yall look at that stuff? the crap sucks the ONLY piece worth anything is the Vambracers. Heck ya can't even argue that the AC is a improvement from what we had. 12 ac on a froggy crown to what 10ac on the ES helm. <P>From what I have seen between me and my wife the post 50 fun part of a Cleric (if you can call it that) is Item gaining. Basically you powers have been improved thru your armor. Here I am at level 53 and I only have maybe 3 pieces of armor that I have left to upgrade. Where as my wife has barely even started getting her Armor upgrades. <P>Ah crud work calls again. I do see your point about Druids getting more upgrades then a Clerics and I think we all hope that the only thing that comes out of these class balence talks is upgrades. Heck I know my wife would like to have more to do then just med, heal, med, heal (which btw when it is just the 2 of us she does do alot more then that heck I'm a Druid we don't need to be healed  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> nothing like giving a Druid the ability to fear anything not just animals add on to that her DDs which arn't nothing to sneeze at when teamed with a Druid and we make a great combo. Add a tank to the mix and things just get boring for her and busy for me  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif">) Oh well back to work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>JimmyPopAli<P>I must be missing something here. I stated that druids already get everything but the kitchen sink and you replied "all we want is the kitchen sink" and you think that is balancing?  Clerics ARE NOT a balanced class.  We are a specialized class that can only do one thing HEAL.  <P>You feel it is perfectly balancing that druids cut into the only ability we clerics have so that you can feel balanced at higher levels?  You have yet to provide a single reasonable justification for why Verant needs to do anything for druids.<P>As to how clerics "earned" it, I play a druid also.  Druids have a cake walk compared to what clerics have to go thru to get to higher levels.  Darn tootin we "earned" it.  Now you feel that not only should you have all the power of a druid but should be almost as good a healer as a cleric too?  <P>Hmm lets see..sow, damage shields, pet at 55 (unlike the piece of crap Verant gave clerics), TP, evacs, invisibility, enduring breath, levitate, group sow, wolf form, group resists, DOTs, nukes, better melee skills, snare, charm animal, charm plant, mana regen, HP regen..oh and AC buffs almost as good as clerics, HP buffs almost as good as clerics and now you can heal almost as well as a cleric.

</FONT><HR>Allexia---<P>/em puts on fire resistant equipment and casts resist fire.<P>Wow.....whatever you do, please don't try and be nice in your response to the kindly druid <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Talk about impolite and rude!  Nice attitude, friend.  I normally do not even respond to anyone that posts in such a negetive manner, but I feel I need to point out some of your misconceptions.<P>"Clerics ARE NOT a balanced class."  <P>I'm still trying to figure out where you think I stated or even implied this statement.  I said that after these changes go live, DRUIDS will be balanced.  As far as healing, our power was increased to the same status it was from 1-40.  Yes, I consider that a significant fix.<P>"You feel it is perfectly balancing that druids cut into the only ability we clerics have so that you can feel balanced at higher levels? You have yet to provide a single reasonable justification for why Verant needs to do anything for druids."<P>Eeeep!  Right about now, you should take a chill pill, friend.  Calm down, count backwards from 10.  Gooooood.  Think of something nice....perhaps, a happy puppy or kitten.  Isn't the kitten cute?  teehee<P>Now that you've come down a notch, I'll provide several reasons I stated (from my previous post, no less) as to why druids want/needed thier healing improvements.<P>1. "healing is what is lacking post 50"<BR>2. "we played 40 levels as a viable healer, then that part of our class was eliminated"<P>So, you're right, I didn't "provide a single reasonable justification for why Verant needs to do anything for druids", I provided two <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>And in reguards to "cutting in on Cleric abilities", I don't know where to begin.  We ARE a priest class, ya know.  We were a viable cleric substitue for 40 levels (as were shaman).  Pallys and Shaman are also "cutting in", but you seem to be verbally against only druids.  Pretty biased.<P>"As to how clerics "earned" it, I play a druid also. Druids have a cake walk compared to what clerics have to go thru to get to higher levels. Darn tootin we "earned" it."<P>O.K..  The pills and happy thoughts don't seem to be working.  How about a nice nap, grumpy pants?  Don't give me that look, mister.  You're grumpy!  Oh yes you are, Mr. Grumpy!  Off to bed now!<P>Now that your nap is finished, let's take a good look at your argument.  First of all, I think the word "tootin" is funny and I will use it at least twice a day from now on.  Secondly, your opinion that clerics should be the only true healers post 50 is self serving and not at all in tune with all the other players in EQ.  Shame on you, Mr. Grumpy pants!<P>"Now you feel that not only should you have all the power of a druid but should be almost as good a healer as a cleric too?"<P>Ah yes!  THE POWER!  I can feel it coursing through my loins!  Nothing can defeat the power of the druid class!  NOTHING! HAHAHAHA!  er....nope, druids didn't want the healing power of clerics, and we didn't get it.  We got not even 2/3 effective healing which is exactley where were were for most of our druidic lives.  <P>"pet at 55 (unlike the piece of crap Verant gave clerics)"<P>Yes your pet is complete garbage.  Ours is nothing more than a RP tool.  It hits for 30 if/when it hits.  Granted, it lends fun to the game, which yours does not.  However, this is no reason to hate me so much.<P>"AC buffs almost as good as clerics, HP buffs almost as good as clerics and now you can heal almost as well as a cleric"<P>I think your definition of "almost as good" leaves alot to be desired.  Oh wait, you left no definition.  And look, no stats either.  Please, let's see how we really compare in this reguard, friend.  The only thing we have on cleric is PoG.  That spell rocks, hehe.  But in certian situations, yours is better.<P>With such a bad attitude, you should be flaming us on the Druid's Grove.  I came here to offer first hand druid experiance in the same vein as the nice clerics that posted on our board in reguards to your class.  Whenever people point to druids as a class full of rude players, I will kindly direct them to your post and say "see, every class has a couple".<P>"People like you make me laugh JimmyPopAli"<P>People like you make me sick Allexia.<BR>  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>After proposed changes are incurred,Clerics are better healers.  Check.  Not by much, just a very small percentage.  Clerical hitpoint buffs are also infintessimally small percentage better than druid equivalent buffs.<P>The disparity between Druids and Shamans in comparison/contrast to clerics remain a thousand percentage points in so many other areas (Spirit of Wolf, portals, evacs, DDs, DoTs, snares, stat buffs, slows, enduring breaths, levitations over lava pools, invisibilities, increased attack speeds) that the incredibly small benefit of being a cleric vs another healing class is pointless, if not outright worthless.  <P>Will the proposed changes go through?  Yes.<P>Verant has tailored their game for the post-51 (better Superior Heal for the other healers) world of Velious and Kunark of massive raids.  To keep druids and shamans competitive at those levels for the events that Verant force feeds all of its players to participate in, the changes are required.<P>Is it fair?  No.  Balance doesn't mean fairness.<P>Is it balanced?  Only in post 51 game which Verant is making Everquest become its sole objective.<P>Prior to 51+ the game of cleric vs druids and shaman is unbalanced.  But, that is not the focus of Verant's vision for Everquest.<P>So, don't expect fairness.  Expect balance ONLY in the 51+ game world of massive raids to which the whole game now spins around.<P>Blame Verant.  Don't blame druids and shaman who are forced to do the same crappy raids as everyone is forced to do.<P><BR>Riffi Gemstone<BR>Bertoxxulous server<BR>gnomish vicar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Jimmy, you're going to have a tough time convincing a lot of clerics that these druid changes are a positive thing. You mentioned that you were perfectly good healers until about level 40, and then that disappeared. That is much of the problem. You see, druids being perfectly good healers is what made the first half of the game so tough for clerics. Every cleric has countless memories of being rejected for groups that would rather have druids who could add much more than mere healing. When you say you want to bring back the druid to being an adequate healer, clerics get flashbacks to those times they couldn't buy a group because druids were everywhere and preferred. Run to the next dungeon - druids got there first. Decide to do cleric quests, druid tracks the spawn and kills it before cleric gets there. Ask for a SoW? 1pp please (to a cleric already beggared by spells and armor costs). Go to camp an item, fight your way in with your inadequate tools, and find a druid sitting there already, having easily passed you by while invis. Proud that you finally hit 44 and got resolution? Everybody wants SLN.<P>In short, these changes conjure all the worst memories of druids that clerics have. Clerics have long been jealous of the travel ability, utility, and offensive punch of druids. New heals will only be viewed as an encroachment (especially by those who don't understand that at level 55+ when druids get those spells, they are a joke) and stir up resentment. Also the fact that druids were addressed first, even though they are really perfectly fine, while there is no word at all on the many longstanding cleric issues, is only going to make it more difficult to get any sympathy for your cause. The best you can hope for is for clerics not to riot.<P>Personally, I'm pretty sure that the major effect of the new druid heals will be to enable them to powerlevel twinks better and to higher level. I know for sure that 500 and 900 point heals won't cut it in the 55+ game, because I have them and have seen exactly how effective they are.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>At first I was a bit annoyed at the changes too. After Fighting tooth and nail for groups to 34 when we finally became the undisputed masters of healing. I felt we had earned the right to be that much better then Druids and Shaman at healing who have soo much more to offer a group. And felt that we would return to the old days of being 2nd choice healers... But I changed my mind, and for one reason..<P>Enchanters<P>It started as a guild discussion, and I started polling the high end enchanters on my server (Luclin) and almost to a tee you know what each one of them said?<P>They wouldn't trust there lives to a Druid/Shaman even with the new Druid spells. Although this might change once things go live. It was a big comfort to me.. And if things change too much... Hell I have a twinked out Bard thats fun as heck to play ^_^<P><BR>Airyel Khe'Chara<BR>51st, Converted High Elven Priestess of Brell<BR>Ministry of Mirth, Luclin<BR>"To heck with mother nature, when was the last time she bought me some ale?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Allexia-------<P>"Perhaps you would receive the response you are seeking there?"<P>This may be where we got off on the wrong foot.  I was not seeking to provoke a response, merely state a druid opinion.  I responded to you as I would a child, simply because you were acting like one.  <P>Jubal-------<P>Heh, I am certian of that, friend!  However, I do not seek to convince clerics that our improved healing will help them get a group.  Although, it may save your behind once in awhile <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I know for a certian it will infringe upon your group ability in one way or another.  I say you have legitimate gripes, but with VI, not with us!  We needed the healing and we got it.  You guys need some utility spells or some viable form of soloing, hopefully you will get that.  If not, please try and remember it's not our fault!  hehe<P>Btw, I understand the frustration of working your way to a spawn only to have it camped.  It's just too bad you singled out druids as your choice example.  I see alot of Necros and extremely high lvls camping lower items than I do druids.  *shrug*  I don't blame them, I blame the players behind the toons.<P>I remember being turned down at every opportunity for in favor of a cleric.  Luckily it rarely (if ever) comes down to one or the other.  My best groups contain both <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I have seen my Brother's cleric go through the phase you speak of, but this happens to every class. Heh, except enchanters.<P>All your class envies are noted and understood as well.  I take for granted my travel ability and solo ability all the time.  Whenever I play my alts, it pains me to travel anywhere what-so-ever.  When I am not SoWed, I feel like I am practically moving in reverse! There is a general feeling of jealousy towards druids.  This is almost, if not equal to, the jealousy expressed towards Necros and Enchanters.  The only advice I can offer is don't hate the player, hate the game.  I consider Necros to be extremely balanced as well, except for high end encounters.....just like us druids were.<P>I seek no sympathy at all, but I offer clerics mine.  I hope you all get some improvements that will make you happy with your class.<P>As far as using the new spells to power level....well, the heals are a tad too powerful to help lvl a newbie <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Any class that has buffs can power level well, clerics definatley included.<P><BR>Airyel------<P>Yes, druids have a bad reputation.  Thankfully, us good druids have lots and lots of friends to fall back on.  I agree this will indeed help clerics get into groups as primary healer.  But if the Enchanters had a choice between a druid/shaman healer or no healer at all, I'm certian of what thier answer would be.  That was one of the reasons our heals needed a boost.  Canceled raids or zoneline-only grouping due to lack of clerics.  I would certianly rather have a cleric as well.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>JimmyPopAli-<P>I was not really refering nor questioning a druid reputation. When asking the question, it was in referance to "Do you think a Druid could keep you alive in a dangerous situation? (I was referring mostlly to Raids where enchanters drop like fly's)<P>But even in some pure xp camps, even the new druid Remedy type spell will fizzle as much as there Superior heal used to. And that will kill a enchanter. And our Heal Over Time spells are sometimes the only way we can keep them alive.<P>I did not mean this as a attack on Druid healing. Mainly as a reminder to the Cleric's that we will still have a highly desired role. That the new healing will in the end not really change our positions that much. It will only really help in normal XP camps, allowing a Druid/Shaman to be a viable Primary Healer. However I truely think when it comes down to any higher risk endevour, your group leaders are still going to do a /who cleric 49 60 all....<P>Airyel Khe'Chara<BR>51st, Converted High Elven Priestess of Brell<BR>Ministry of Mirth, Luclin<BR>"To heck with mother nature, when was the last time she bought me some ale?"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well this is my opinion for what its worth...<P>I have a whole bunch of shaman and druid friends with whom I group frequently. I am very happy that they will receive an upgrade and will actually make our groups more capable.<P>But at the same time I am a little bit worried. Worried that people who thought of this change didn't look at the whole picture and long term consequences. It is hard to predict the exact outcome of this, but I think one thing is safe to conclude.<P> This will greatly increase the already large number of druids and shamans and it will nudge the cleric pupulation into steady decline. High level clerics were already rare due to various issues, and now if you take away the ease of finding pickup groups and getting into raids that we have now, there will be very little inscentive to play a high level cleric as opposed to shaman or druid. <P>Take a level 60 Shaman with new heals and level 60 Cleric in account and see what each brings to the table. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Do you think a cleric is gonna CH when theres a pull of 7 mobs while an enchanter is attempting to mez ?  He sticks to faster heals like remedy and DL.  CH is used during controlled circumstances.  The use of remedy/DL far outweighs the use of CH.  Hell maybe your just sucking it up at the zone line and getting single pulls (yay! thats gotta be fun!).  Hey forgive me, I'm not one of the pansy types that'll log out when they can't get a perfect group.<P>As far as raiding, I'd like to see you use your idiotic logic about our "greatest" strengths when raiding Gore, Trak, Sev, Talendor, Hoshgar, Phara Dar, Silverwing, Xygoz, Nexona, Drush, etc, etc.  Anyways, not gonna bother debating with someone who's obviously cluesless, never left the zoneline or never even seen mobs that explain why these type of spells are our greatest strength.  <P>Perhaps the kitchen sink is what landed on your head.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Im sorry but did I miss something? I thought clerics were the cream of the crop when it came to healing.  I remember having to run around like a chicken with my head chopped off looking for a gorup when all a druid had to do was kite a yellow to death SOLO.  I could barely take a bluey on at the time. Clerics have it hard enough trying to group and now VI's going to be easier for druids to group at higher levels? Balance? I guess VI never heard of it. <BR>Now, can someone explain to me why a druid who WAS used to being a decent healer up until level 40 should be a viable healer NOW? This is treading on cleric's ground big time since those are the higher levels, we should be the big healers right?  <BR>If this goes live, I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of people retired their clerics for something else just due to the frustration that another class can do their job (minus 1 spell) just as good as them.  <BR>Oh yes, a warrior one dimentional? At least they have weapons options that proc, as well as warrior disciplines.   Now play a cleric who's only sole speciality is CH.  You tell how one dimentional is that?<P>on a lighter note, it would be nice to get a spell on the lines of hmm... group CH maybe? :Evil grin.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm not happy about this, Clerics give up far too much in order to do what we do..which is HEAL.  No other class should even come close, at any level.  The fact that the only attention the Clerical class has recieved in the past year has been to degrade our already semi-useless pet into a totally useless one and the infamous mark of karn nerf are just an added slap in the face.  Funny how Shaman have their nice pets and Druids have their damage sheilds that do more damage than the old Mark of Karn healed.  I'm sorry, but the right answer to getting druids to group more is not giving them our abilities and continuing to ignore us.

</FONT><HR>Sigh people STILL don't understand the high end game.<P>I lead raids. Very, very big raids. Here is how I classify desireability for those raids:<BR>Warrior: very high<BR>Cleric: very high<BR>Rogue: very high<BR>Monk: decent<BR>Ranger: decent<BR>Enchanter: need 1 or 2, after that worthless<BR>Shaman: need 1 or 2, after that worthless<BR>SK: very low<BR>Bard: very low<BR>Paladin: very low<BR>Magician: very low<BR>Necromancer: very low<BR>Druid: worthless<BR>Wizard: worthless<P>Do you have any idea how harsh this difference is? A friend of mine has a lvl 55 wizard and a lvl 56 rogue. Damage to Yelinak was ~2800 with wizard and over 31000 with the rogue. Druid will heal around 5000hp during the fight whereas a cleric will be going over 100k hp. All you low levels think that this is fair because "druids have it easy on the low levels". That means absolutely NOTHING. Powergamers spend like 5% of their playing time below lvl 40, and after that its all about the cleric.<P>Verant needs to do something to fix the melee/spells imbalance, since melee is always getting better weapons along with their level progression upgrades, which Verant doesn't seem to realize. Getting an equal caster and warrior at lvl 50 and giving them comparable upgrades in Kunark DOES NOT WORK when you give the goddamn warrior a change in weapons from 8/24 to 14/20 in the same time. The warrior will blow the caster away every time. Clerics are in luck because our power is tied to the power of those that we heal, so we're coming up in power with the melee.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR>Avatars of Discord, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>In normal lvling i use remedy 90% of the time, celestial healing 95% ... why should i use complete heal ... ?Efficiency? What if the person goes link dead when low ... what if i go link dead ... what if someone trains ... i prefer to have very well controlled pulls ... and if not ... I can't use cheal because of emergency heals on the enchanters. <P>Now I'm on tallon zek, don't have billions of high lvl warriors there, I end up healing pets fairly often.  Also on Tallon we don't have everything camped, and can easily be trained out (90% of the time i go to a dungeon there are under 6 people there).<P>Anyway, I don't have a big problem with druids havin sup healing at 49, and shamans havin remedy, but if they introduce the current changes from test into production without dealing with all the cleric nerfs ...  i'm retiring my lvl 56 cleric except for guild events.<P>Ya clerics are better for guild events, (so some of u lvl 60 clerics might not care), but for normal clerics always knowing someone is gonna out lvl you and probably out heal u is too much.  (i think of balance of how much healing can a druid that put 10 days of game time in compared to a cleric that put 10 days of game time in ... i would dare say the druid that has the same game time as the cleric can way way out heal him/her.<P>Phaith</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I see a lot of complaint about "playing a cleric is boring" and "we don't come into out own until 39"...<P>I'm only 34 (few more kills to 35, no book! WOOT!), but I must say I am having a BLAST playing a cleric. It is just so cool to watch those tanks look at you in amazement when you bring their hitpoints from 1 and a half bubbles all the way back to full. True, it takes them a bit to get used to it, but eventually, they learn to trust you. Once they do, they will NEVER prefer a druid or shaman over a cleric.<P>I don't know, I can't speak for how these changes will affect me as a cleric in the 50+ game (not for a few days, anyway  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif">), but so far, I am finding playing a cleric fun and exciting, and also finding that even at 34, groups prefer me to druids and shaman (actually they want both), because I can heal SO much better.<P>All that said, I believe that clerics really DO need a self-only invis and levitate. Travelling as a cleric is dangerous at best. Sure, we have to depend on others to get XP. I have no problem with that. I am oerhaps THE best grouping class, and proud of it. I don't need to solo, because I can /ooc cleric LFG and be in tell hell most of the time. However, I don't think it fair that we should have to depend on others to travel in relative safety. Most people travel alone, rather than in a group. Those same people who beg for us to group with them aren't interested in sowing, invising, and levitating us so that we can get to where we need to go safely.<P>Please Verant, GIVE US SELF-ONLY INVIS AND LEV!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Geneze,<P>I'm with you, in that 34th is actually the level you pull equal to a druid and shaman in balance.  Finally, your combat heals do significantly better than theirs, even though their regenerations are far better in mana efficiency.  Thus, relatively equivalent/balanced.<P>I'm not surprised 34th is a grand level for you.  If you struggled from 1 - 33rd, then the picture changes, and now you are their equal.  Great job on making it!<P>Once you hit 39th, you'll for the first time have an ability/spell no one else can duplicate or equal.  So, in that regard, the balance swings to the cleric side and essentially stays with you from there onwards.<P>So, for balance sake, I can see the other healing professions obtaining better heals as they progress past the 40s and into the 50s.  I only remain hopeful that Verant understands how unbalanced the healing classes are, in terms of clerics being on the low side, particularly levels 24 to 33rd.<P>For healing purposes, regeneration at 24th for a shaman is far too powerful compared to a clerical GHeal (Regen healing 410 vs the GHeal of 288).  At 29th, when the shaman also gets GHeal, the balance gets even worse for the weaker cleric.  At its absolute worst, 33rd level, the regeneration heals 545, and the GHeal only 306.  Two Greater heals at 300 mana only marginally heals more than the single 100 mana casted regeneration.<P>The healing disparity of weaker clerics versus superior druid/shaman healing doesn't even touch upon the far greater variety of spells of those other professions ... it merely exacerbates an already huge disparity.<P>Hopefully, Verant will understand that balance at the uber levels isn't the only place balance needs to be in place.<P>Enjoy the game, Geneze.<P><BR>Riffi Gemstone<BR>gnomish vicar<BR>Bertoxxulous server<BR>"Praise Brell"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
