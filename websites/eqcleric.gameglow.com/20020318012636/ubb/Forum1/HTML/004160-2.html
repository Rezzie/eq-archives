</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Seliris:<BR>2. Do they have a dedicated Dev team/SWAT team/customer response team? or is it all a BASE code team?  <P>Reason: If there is only a BASE team, then chances are they are tasked with Velious and other advances more often than bug fixes... (read: Money.. it's all about money guys)<P><BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I personally have been saying this is the core of the problem for quite some time.  Verant was a smallish company before EQ came out, and most likely only had a Devo Engineering team, and not a Sustaining Engineering team.  Coding new stuff makes money.  Fixing code in old stuff does not.  I have been in Abashi's place, actually, for a MUCH less popular product.  We suffered the same problems.  There were major, crippling bugs that did not get fixed for some 14 months.  The reason for this was that we did not have a separate sustaining engineering team, and the programmers(and their managers) had to choose between coding something new, exciting, ground breaking, and money making, or 2 year old code that in many cases, they did not write.  I see a LOT of the same behavior in Verant, so I assume that their sustaining team is either A)lacking in talent, B)lacking in staff, or both.  Abashi could be going to the programmers/higher ups with the problems that he sees as legitimate, they might just not be getting done. <P>That being said, I don't think that Abashi is doing that good of a job being the spokesperson for the players.  One of the BIG tips to being a successful CR person is to sympathize with the customer, and make it known to them that you understand their plight, and that you will do whatever you can to address their issue.  Another big tip is to honestly answer the questions, even if it is not what the people want to hear or it makes you look bad.  I would much rather hear "What you reported is a bug, but we don't know how to fix it" than "It is working as intended", when everyone seems to agree that it is indeed NOT working as it should, or has in the past.  <P>Abashi really should start trying to get the customers on his side, by any means possible.  This will cut down on the threats, cut down on the sniping from the players, and I think will gain a better sense of communication between Verant and the customers, which I think was reason he was brought on board.  <P>I do feel bad sometimes for the guy, I wouldn't like thousands of people to curse my name.  <P><P>------------------<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Llumis Atreideis<BR>Constant, Reliant, Ardent, and Penitent<BR>True Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>member of The Jaded Band<BR>36th Blessing, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Isn't it also possible that Verant and some people on the message board simply have different ideas about how the game should work?  With anything as complex as EQ, there are going to be many areas where reasonable people can differ on game design; whatever Verant chooses to do, some of its customers will be upset.<P>You often see posts on the message boards to the effect of "everyone agrees that X needs to be done, therefore Verant should do it."  Usually, the "everyone" in question refers to the posters on a given thread on the message boards.  From Verant's perspective, this often doesn't mean much.  Posters on the message boards are a minority (probably a small minority) of EQ players, and they aren't a representative sample.  You really can't conclude from posts on the official message boards that "everyone" agrees on anything.<P>Aquinas<BR>37th level Cleric of Lanys T'Vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

If you believe that class X is balanced, and one of your customers says that class X is weak and needs to be improved, how do you respond?<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>You are absolutely right, it is quite a tight rope to walk.  Take the whole ranger problem.  I would have said right out "At first glance, the test teams have determined that there are some problems with the Ranger class, but are unsure of a solution that would both please the ranger crowd without stepping on any other class' feet.  More research will have to be done to further determine the best course of action."  Of course, that would wear thin after 8 months.  At some point, Abashi should have gone to whomever he could, with the player's requests in hand, and hash out what the programming/balance objectives were to each one.  Then come back to the players and explain it as such.  I think that one of the biggest problems that Abashi has is that he comes out and gives flat, black and white answers.  It may seem like smoke-screening, but he needs to say things like "We are looking into it." instead of "It is working as intended." right away.  <P>------------------<BR>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>Llumis Atreideis<BR>Constant, Reliant, Ardent, and Penitent<BR>True Elf Cleric of Tunare<BR>member of The Jaded Band<BR>36th Blessing, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>No, I don't think Abashi should be fired.  The problem isn't Abashi, it is VI and their views on CS as a whole and also testing as a whole.  I'll speak from three perspectives here:  programmer (my job), Test server resident (play), and as a former guide.  Abashi is only the tip of the iceberg of VI problems.  <P>The guide program functions EXACTLY the same way as the "whineplay" boards.  Guides that do not toe the party line and post negative comments on guide boards are severly censored or even fired.  I left the program after feeling the frustration of this as one member after another on my guide server quit or were fired.  A server that had no Senior guide for over 3 months.  Abashi was a part of that culture and helped create it.  Guides brought up many legitimate concerns last summer.  After being told to be quiet or things were working as intended, the program was eventually revamped.<P>Fast forward to the future and the entry of Abashi to the "whineplay" boards.  The same mentality is there.  We are told it works as intented, there isn't a problem, etc.  Then months later, changes are made.<P>All these things are simply the cultural view of life from the VI mountaintop.  Phrases like "The Vision" and "Your in our world now" says a LOT about how VI views itself and its customers.  It automatically creates and "Us" versus "Them" mentality for both parties.  This permeates all the way down to the coding and testing level, I would argue.  On a place like Test server, very few people are actually "testing" as you would normally test things wrt software.  Maybe a dozen or two tops.  The rest of the population is largely ignored or penalized by VI's record keeping and shoddy testing methods and shoddy backup methods (hence the i-wipe at the end of the Kunark beta and probably another i-wipe at the end of Velious testing).  I can tell you this, every single bug or anomoly that I have encountered and reported over a year of playing there has went live.  Every last single one.  Not a single exception.<P>A lot of this has to do with growth, I really believe.  A lot of companies that are not mature go through this.  VI is a GREAT company for putting out a game and one of the worst for supporting it.  You have VI, 989 studios, Sony, the semi-independent guide program all located in different locations, multiple chains of command and multiple visions about what is important for successful gaming.  All of this leads to the problems that we now have.<P>The bottom line, for me, isn't Abashi, it is VI in general and their attitudes.  Yes, Abashi could take a lesson in customer service and how to interact with people better.  But replacing will not change one single thing about how VI itself operates.  Therein is the problem.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just speaking for myself, while I have occasionally read the posts of angry people (a LOT at everquest.com, fewer at everlore, VERY few here), most of the time I can agree with whatever Abashi says, or at least sympathize with his position. Then again, with all the angry "FIRE HIM" to "KILL HIM" posts, one would assume that most negative posts just settle into a background buzz at some point. *shrug* Perhaps I am too agreeable or polite. If next patch came along and, for example, they doubled all healing spells casting time, or halved every effectiveness, yes it would bother me.... but they have EVERY right to do this. If after X hours of getting every last icon/whatever they emergency patched and changed all the quests I WOULD get irritated... but at no point did it say that the quests would be there forever, or that the rewards would always be there... in fact they have gone out of their way to repeatedly state that changing drops and quests could and would happen.<BR>Maybe I am not a 'serious' enough player, that I would agree with the Verant perspective....but in my opinion the more irate people might be taking this game a touch *TOO* seriously.<BR>So my personal vote? No, Gordon has not lost it, he seems to be doing the best he can at a job that I would not envy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
