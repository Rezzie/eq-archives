I play a lvl 5 hlfling cleric on the Solusek ro server. I joined a group of 2 pallys one mage and 2 other clerics and the decided they wanted to journey to befallen so me being a destroyer of undead jumped at the chance to rid the world. but upon arriveing i infomed the group that his was my first time as a healer in a group and that i usually play a tank. they sai dok and battle begun after a few rounds of heales and a bunch of dead skeles one of my boys died. i was dman upset and very appolpgetic (i spelled it wrong i know). so i asked then i fi should meeelee or just kick backthey informed me that as the prime healer  i should just sit and watch the health and let my manna build up,plus send out the odd ward dead. so neadless to say after abotu an hour in befallen no one had diead and i had made some new freinds.<br />
<br />
being a healer is way more fullfilling than a tank<br />

It took me untill level 15 to learn this. I must say though that you will get tired of your spellbook in the next 30 levels. Just don't fall prey to the urge to re-arrange it for something different to look at.<br />

<br />
Mana regenerates at a constant rate, sitting or standing, unless you are meditating--which you can't until level 8.  Sitting out of fights will not get you mana faster;  you might as well be in there mixing it up with the tanks.<br />
<br />
After all, at level 5 we're practically as effective damage-dealers as most tanks.<br />

Explain to them that you don't get meditate until level 8, and until then, it wouldn't have made a difference either way. <br />
<br />
I would suggest reserving almost all mana for heals instead of undead nukes until you get a faster way of regenerating mana (meditate)..</div></div><hr />
