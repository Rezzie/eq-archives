FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL THEM TOO  Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a problem and need some assistance. I play on the Nameless server with 2 accounts, Vumondo and Vumon. Today, after many many hours of camping Ragefire in Solb, he spawns at about 11:30 am EST. Our guild &quot;Serenity Within&quot; gathers more members to complete this task. The pearl is given and we do battle with Ragefire. Upon his death, Zordakalicus spawns as he should. We do battle with him but as he should die with no health at all, he continues (possible bug, I don't know) to fight and kill till all are dead. I (Vumon 55 Cleric) am bound there and start in a death loop. 7 additional times I die, taking about one min(zoning problems as of late) to pop back in front of Zorg and die again. Finally I /q to stop the death loop as CR is beginning and I do not want AOE to catch the others. Now is what I have my biggest problem with. Zorg despawned within 10 minutes of my last death. I (Vumondo) /petition immediately and get a very quick response from Zelzar. He pops into Kael (where Vumondo is bound) and we chat about the issue. He advises me that I will have to repetition after 7pm EST as that is when Vinshayr Lead GM will be on. We (the guild) maintain the Ragefire camp all day awaiting an answer from Vinshayr. I repetition at 6:45 pm EST as Zelzar told me to. I speak with another gm and he tells me Vinshayr will be with me shortly. Vinshayr and I talk about the issue and the final answer is he can do nothing without a gm witnessing the actual event.<br />
<br />
This is where things are wrong as I see it. Am I to petition each time any battle of importance is to occur and request a GM be present to witness it IN CASE something goes wrong. The thought is plain silly. The GM's have a job and have always done it good and fair as far as I can tell. My dealings with them have been good. I have like I said 2 accounts thanks to the split you all offered and I really enjoyed doing it. Costly buying all the software and paying for both accounts but I felt like it was worth it. I have been playing since December 1999 and have over 200 days on all my characters combined. I do not buy or sell on ebay. I have earned everything that I have. Now, after all this, with 20+ other characters there am being called a liar. How can I prove it. How can I report text that is no longer in the window to prove this. What can I do to make things right. <br />
<br />
I asked for one of two things from Vinshayr. 1) For the Shimmering pearl back and to make Ragefire spawn again or<br />
2) simply to make Zordakalicus spawn so we could finish the job. The final answer is there is NOTHING he can do for me.<br />
<br />
What I am asking you here and now is to give one of the 2 things I asked Vinshayr for. I have placed my characters on a hold until I receive a response from you. Please don't take this in anyway negative. I can not see continuing to play EQ with this unresolved issue. This was to be the highlight of my EQ life, yeah EPIC, however, it turned out to be the worst day I have played. <br />
<br />
Attached is the only evidence that I was there today. Note the Shimmering pearl in the left slot. <br />
