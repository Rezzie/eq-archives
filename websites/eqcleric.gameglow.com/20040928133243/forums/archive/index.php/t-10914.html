<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">11-22-2001, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First: I'm a total newbie regarding ToV. Have only been L57 for 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
I have been asked to join a raid (giant faction, north wing?) and have a few questions.<br />
1. Since I'm both kos to dragons and giants (trying to get it up), will that cause any problems getting there?<br />
2. Any recommandations as to what resist gear to wear? I mean, I don't want to drag all my resist gear along if only fire and cold is needed.<br />
3. I don't have word of restoration yet. Is that a problem?<br />
4. Is there any kind of odd aggro in that place? I.e. you sit in a normal looking place and the next minute you are getting pounded by 5 L65 mobs.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
Tundar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">11-22-2001, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. No, when you go with a giant aligned crew there are no faction issues at all as they are kos to everything too.<br />
<br />
2. For the named fights in ToVN/W clerics dont need resist gear except for one where I put on max mr - other guilds may haev different tactics that require different gear though. For clearing trash moderate fr/cr is nice - I usually dont go overboard but settle for 160-170 of each buffed. At level 57 you might want to be in the 180-200 range buffed though.<br />
<br />
3. Not really. I personally only use that for Hoshkar and Trakanon - not for Zlexak and never for fighting trash. Others mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
4. Just stand up on inc to avoid needless ping pong - no really odd places I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arianae</div><div class="date">11-23-2001, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) no, going with a giant faction guild this won't be a problem.<br />
<br />
2) resist stuff isnt a huge deal, you need fire/cold/maybe magic.  The AEs off most of the trash are not too bad, wurms are a pita, but resists never seem to make much difference for me there anyways.  Just dont piss off the blue ones, they proc a hp/mana drain dot that is quite nasty.<br />
<br />
3) Should not be an issue, even if they use it for Zlex there are other things for you to do during the fight.<br />
<br />
4)  Dont open any doors you arent told to, other than that, no weird agro that I know of and if there is your pullers should be aware of it and you should be warned before it becomes an issue /shrug<br />
<br />
Another note, if you have to camp, do not camp against a wall, you can end up back at zone in.<br />
