<br />
Most spots which allow xp and are solo for a cleric seem to be Cyndreela, spectral creatures in Trakanon's Teeth (near Emerald Jungle zone), and ...well... Anyone have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Of course, it's a given that clerics are not a solo class, but I'm finding that sometimes it's not feasible to log on, find a group, and hunt for 20 hours. (Which is basically the only way to get xp)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions, even the ones around Kunark, are appreciated.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Boring as hell, I just pull blue zols and dars (green, exp zols arent worth it).<br />

now and Otters will no longer agro against<br />
either the Drakes nor against the Bulthars.<br />
<br />
Still it's a great place to hunt though...<br />

<br />
First take away the Othmir aggro on bulthars and Drakes<br />
<br />
Then go ahead and give the Drakes new AE capabilities! From talking to guildmates they now do a NASTY AE Stun and have a very nasty root.<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
WTF was Verant thinking? First they give Velious outdoor zones the worst exp modifier in the game. Then they make mobs like the CS drakes have insane AE spells.<br />
<br />
It appears that Verant only wants people to run thru Velious outdoor zones instead of hunting in them... i just don't get the logic here<br />
<br />
/sigh there goes one of the best solo spots for 50+ clerics.. why take the chance now...<br />

<br />
Thou shall not solo as a cleric.<br />
Thou shall wait for 3 hours using our nifty lfg feature instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grrr, I used to like that zone, great for a mage/cleric duo but these new AE's and the slow othimirs can really upset me. Why ruin a otherwise great (and mostly empty) zone?</div></div><hr />
