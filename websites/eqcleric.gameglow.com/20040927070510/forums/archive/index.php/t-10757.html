<br />
<br />
Looked back at the old posts and decided to go o feeroot to solo the spec at lvl 45.  Pulled the one in there, then 2 more came in from outside and joined the fun.  Barely made it out alive.  I tried this again later after scouting arount to make sure I olny saw one, and sure enough the same thing happened.  <br />
<br />
Can anyone give me an idea for another relatively safe spot in the old world to solo through 45 hell?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

The plagueborne thiefs in DL.  Easy single pulls, and fairly safe.   Just get a port, go to the wizzie spires, cast Sense Undead and run over that way.  Single pull every time with Turning, and the blasted with the current undead DD.</div></div><hr />

It was happening to me for a while too until I tried pulling him the opposite way from the cave.  Since you only have to nuke him 3 times, you still shoulod not get too close to the ogre guards.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

They are near the middle of the zone, south-west of the totem pole. Looking at the guards the one to the right is a shaman, the one to the left is a sk. The shaman is easier.  Not quite as good exp as the spec though.<br />
<br />
Between the spec in feerot, grouping for hgs in Rathe, and those two troll guards I spent alot of 45 around there.</div></div><hr />
