<br />
Here is the story:<br />
<br />
Agility tells you 'Can you res me at Fear entrance for 550pp?'<br />
You tell Agility 'I can but it will take a few for me to get there'<br />
Agility tells you 'Thanks, I'll be waiting for you'<br />
<br />
15 minutes at 7 zones later<br />
<br />
Agility tells you 'Let me drag corpse to this corner'<br />
You tell Agility 'Ready for res?'<br />
Agility tells you 'y'<br />
You begin casting.<br />
Agility says 'thanks'<br />
<br />
You say 'where did you go?'<br />
/w agility all<br />
<br />
no matches found<br />
<br />
15 mins later<br />
<br />
/w agility all<br />
<br />
no matches found<br />
<br />
2 hours later<br />
<br />
/w agility all<br />
<br />
[Annonomus] Agility<br />
<br />
You tell agility 'Where the hell is my payment?'<br />
Agility tells you 'Where did you go?'<br />
You tell Agility 'I waited 20 mins and you didn't come back.... where are you now?'<br />
Agility tells you 'I'm in Akanon'<br />
<br />
Loading Please Wait...<br />
you have entered akanon<br />
<br />
You tell Agility 'Ok I'm in Akanon at the Priest of Discord, meet me here?'<br />
Agility tells you 'sure be right there'<br />
<br />
2 mins later<br />
<br />
/w agility all<br />
<br />
no matches found<br />
<br />
You say 'Son of a (*&amp;%^$#'<br />
<br />
<br />
This went on for 3 days, he rarely logs on now because when ever he does I have a large group of friends (more than 20 so ignore won't hold them all) pelt him with comments.  Once the /tell-fest begins he usually runs away and logs off within 15 mins.<br />
<br />
In short, this guy Agility does not deserve to be res'd by anyone... If you think this guy is a friend, rethink your definition.  He'll stab you in the back after promissing you something you could use.<br />
