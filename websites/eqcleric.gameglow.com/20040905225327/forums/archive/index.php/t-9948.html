There's a little known clerical problem called the &quot;Rezz0rs Curse&quot;.  <br />
<br />
This curse makes it so that anytime you hit a rezzing level (39, 49, 56) and scribe your new rez, you *will* be killed.  You'll lose your level, be unable to scribe your new rez, and there won't be another cleric within 10 zones in any direction.  <br />
<br />
Then you'll have to rez yourself back with your old rez spell.<br />

I remember when I dinged 49.  I managed to get 2 orange into it (you would think that would have been enough not to lose it).  My guild decided to raid Fear for the first time, no one knew how to break it, or anything about the zone really.  Well, that raid turned into a 9 hour CR..most of us died multiple times.  I died more from that necro chick outside than I died inside.  I died so many times that I ended up losing 49 for good, only had 1 corpse where my timer ran out.  That night sucked  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

Ding - you have gained a level - welcome to lv 56.<br />
