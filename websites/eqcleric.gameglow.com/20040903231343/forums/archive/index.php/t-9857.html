<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">06-23-2000, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a similar situation last night in Nektulos Forest. I was heading from Lavastorm towards EC to do a Revive for a Pally in Oasis (he had been caught by a Spec train). As I crossed over the river, a skeleton was standing on the hillside there. He immediately aggro'd on me (nothing new), and I ran him over to the EC zone in case a newbie wanted to kill him for the EXP or bone chips. Since noone was at the zone, I turned to toss a Wrath into him and continue on my Revive mission. (Keep in mind that the skele had not even hit me for a single point of damage yet)<br />
<br />
So I start casting Wrath, thinking one shot, one kill. Hehe WRONG! He resisted my Wrath completely, and then the Holy Might and Force right after that. WTH? I actually had to melee this bonehead because he resisted every spell I threw at him... granted it was fun to beat him down after doing the Heal/Buff/Med thing all night long in Sol A  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
