<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teclis</div><div class="date">11-28-1999, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now i'm a 31st high elf cleric, and i'm really having trouble doing anything these days... died 8 times in the last 2 levels, I dont' know what the hell is wrong with me.  I've tried Unrest, Cazic, and Lguk...<br />
Unrest has the worst exp, but least likely to die<br />
Cazic has decent exp, and decent chance to die<br />
Lguk has good exp, but I die by the second =).<br />
Anyway i've spent 24hrs on this level already, and i'm only halfway through, i've died 5 times, i need some suggestions  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

You can either fight in upper guk right at the live zone or go down to lower guk and fight at the bottom of the ramp.  Upper guk is mostly blue frogs but there are so many the little exp they give just keeps adding up.  In lower guk there are frogs that range from blue to red and the greater mino's that are level 32-35.  Also if you are lucky you can kill the mino patriarch and get a pair of azure sleeves.  I was lucky and got 2 sleeves in 2 days and they paid for a plat ruby veil and 1 +6wis ring  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Also, you can pretty much walk up to the room with the ladder without an invis, when you go down it you better have an invis or you will die for sure.<br />
