<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A11e</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard a couple of clerics suggesting that medding while standing would be a big boon to clerics.  I wounder if adding a standing mana regen boost to Yaulp 2, 3 and 4 would be what we are looking for?  Since it is short duration, it wouldn't be unbalancing.  We need the boost in attack that Yaulp give us if we are going to be meleeing anyway.  Besides, most clerics almost never cast Yaulp now.  This would give us a reason to use it.  Right now, I find it difficult to justify joining in meleeing when I could be spending my time medding.<br />
<br />
If implemented it could work something like this:<br />
<br />
Yaulp 2 = breeze<br />
Yaulp 3 = clarity<br />
Yaulp 4 = clarity 2<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts fellow clerics?</div></div><hr />

As nice as a lot of these recent ideas are, i'm being practical as to what actually happens.  It's nice to dream about what could happen and all that, but facing reality, they won't give us any of these fancy thoughts.<br />
