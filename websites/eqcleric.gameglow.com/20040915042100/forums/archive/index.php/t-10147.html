I have been looking to get a few items as of late, and seems that everybody is looking to trade items rather than sell.  A couple of them items that i'm interested in currently are gatorscale leggings, mammoth hide cloak, runed circlet and 1 mith bracer.  If anybody has any of them items and would like to sell, let me know, or if you have a lot of friends that might be interested in helping to set up a Bazaar that would be great.  I have friends at work that have bazaars on their servers every saturday and they say it works great.</div></div><hr />

It might take a few sessions to get it going, but once it did, I think it could be beneficial for everybody.</div></div><hr />
