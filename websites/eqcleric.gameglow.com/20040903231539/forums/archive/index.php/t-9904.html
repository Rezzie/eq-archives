<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiamme</div><div class="date">10-12-2000, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never cease to be amazed by the folks who think that because you helped them once when they need it, you are their ‘friend’ and they can call on you any time, whether you are grouped or not.<br />
<br />
Example of this is the halfling warrior I’d rezzed before, and thus had me pegged as a ‘yes of course’ cleric.  ‘no’ just couldn’t seem to register.  He asked me to rez his necro friend while I was in a very underpowered group for the executioner’s room in Guk.  I said ‘only if he can dump mana, I’m overstretched here’.  Fine, the necromancer decides he doesn’t need rezzed and I carry on just scraping through each fight mana-wise.  I get another tell ‘oh I died and I’m in Freeport, can you rez me.’ I sigh to myself then say explain that I’m in a very underpowered group and that taking my mana endangers the group.  With some persuasion I agree to do the one rescuscitate, due to past casual acquaintance grouping with the guy.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, not just his corpse but those of the  three groupmates I wasn’t told about get dragged to me, and I’m left telling my group to stop pulling, invis themselves and wait while I med up the mana to rez these folks one by one.  The necro doesn’t show up to dump mana, and I had to choose whether to have them drag the corpses right away again or do it.  After my group grumbling but agreeing, I perform the resurrections and explain again to this casual rez acquaintance that I cannot spare the mana and will not be able to do this again.  I have toggled /roleplay at this point, rare for me, because I’m just not able to spare mana safely and have to take a good run up to say ‘no’.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later the SAME halfling warrior comes and plunks himself down beside me. “Can you please complete heal me.”<br />
<br />
At this point I explain that he is inconsiderately taking mana from my group and  inflicting down time on my group so that he can solo.  I  am just BOGGLED by folks that cannot take a hint.  I also wish that I could just get ASSERTIVE and not get bullied into doing stuff that makes me feel exploited.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">10-13-2000, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am always amazed (why do I never learn?) when this happens to me. I am getting more and more unavailable as the days and nights in EQ wear on, and while I have resisted the urge to stay on /role so far, some days it would just be easier to go on roleplay and not deal with the beggars.<br />
<br />
Last night I was hunting in Overthere, at the ruined tower where the Sarnaks spawn (GREAT Exp by the way in a small group). I get a tell from a kewl d00d Gnome Necro, who had been spamming the zone with his blathering, asking for a res. Our group was pretty much done for the night, and I thought what the hell, I can help him out on the way to FM. So I asked him to drag his corpse to the FM zone area and I would be there in awhile. Just about the time my Bard friend and I am reaching the FM area the shout goes out, &quot;Goon at FM Zone&quot;. This Necro and his buddies start laughing and laughing about how the KOS people are in deep trouble. That is until I reminded him that a KOS person was coming to res him...<br />
<br />
After I ressed him he proceeded to turn to his group and hunt. No thank you and no attempt at a donation (which was not expected, but the gesture would have been nice). The only sure way to get on my do not help list is to not even pay me the courtesy of thanking me for the time and effort I had just put forth. What happened next? Dragoon! I hate dying in a post-hell level. This a_kewl_d00d_necro_01 will never receive my help again. Ever.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sonard</div><div class="date">10-15-2000, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 3 clerics in my guild who are all the same level (we have been keeping up with each other pretty well since 30) and we tend to fight in the same areas.  I was in FM the other day waiting for a group when a necro (why is it in FM EVERY rez request is from a necro or drood? if you want to solo, then expect to die) asks me for a rez.  I say ok (im FM and doing nothing anyway, and he is right in front of me).  I rez him and he starts telling me that he is good friends with a cleric in my guild named n-something (they are such good friends he doesn't even know her name).  About 5 minutes later I am in a group and head down to the Sarnak ruins (where, if you are primary healer, you just don't have extra mana, there is constant pulling to keep the spawns broken). Sure enough Mr. Necro sends me a tell about 1/2 hour later, begging for a rez.  I say that now is not a good time as I am in group and don't have mana.  He persists, and I am trying to be polite and tell him firmly but kindly that there is no chance of it happening.  I finally tell the guy off when the requests not only get more insistant, but now he wants me to rez his friends as well.   Finally when I give him my &quot;No means no&quot; speal, he leaves me alone.  The next day my guild mate that he was &quot;such good freinds with&quot; is on and we are chatting and she says, BTW, if you are in FM, watch out for Soandso, if you rez him once he'll never leave you alone.  Guess who she was talking about?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">10-16-2000, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, a long while back I was running through Oasis to help out a friend.<br />
<br />
While I was dinking around out there, a little druid gave me a tell asking if I could rez her if she gave me a lift.  I was doing nothing, so I agreed.<br />
<br />
Got her rezzed, and went about my business.  Ever since then, every so often she'll send me a tell (and apparently has told her whole guild how 'nice' I am) asking for a rez in the damndest places - Dalnir's, Kaesora, etc. when I'm in places like the Hole, Kedge, and Karnor's.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
She's a nice girl, and takes no for an answer, but it seems weird to me that she continues asking.<br />

<br />
Then whenever anyone asks for a rez and you can't be bothered, just hit this hotkey before anyone else sends you a tell, and you have a moment of relief  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">10-17-2000, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I say &quot;sorry no, I'm busy&quot; and the fellow just don't accept it I say NO again and further tells just don't recieve a reply. I am fed up with explaining rez-beggars why I can't leave a group and come rez them half a zone or more away.<br />
I, and I alone decide what I do in my playtime.<br />
Don't get me wrong, I sometimes spend some time at the zone in LGuk (or elsewhere)rezzing and healing and get nothing but a smile and a thank you, and thats just fine by me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brune Bristleboom</div><div class="date">10-19-2000, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just say NAY!<br />
The roleplay feature is a godsent to us clerics....i NEVER play without roleplay on unless i am on an alliance event etc....and what do you know?<br />
Nagafen...as soon as i go out of roleplay <br />
BAM slamed with res tells i am 51 ad people flock to that vicar title for some reason for resses etc...<br />
i used to give in not wanting to be the bad guy when people needed the ress..<br />
Don't get me wrong i sit at zones and ress people sometimes....buff people etc....<br />
but sometimes you just don;t have the mana or want to be bothered with a res....and people never understand...they always want to say but i can pay you!!<br />
like money will make up for that 700 mana when my group is getting beat on right after that fight  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
