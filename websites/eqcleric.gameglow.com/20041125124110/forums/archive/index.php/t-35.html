<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traveling Poet</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, guess what. I traded the Bladestopper. I got a Medicine Totem for it. Now my pre-planar list is almost complete.<br />
<br />
Left ear: Forest Loop<br />
Right ear: Forest Loop<br />
Face: Platinum Ruby Vail<br />
Shoulder: Adamantite Epolets<br />
Left Bracer: Ethereal Mist<br />
Hands: Ethereal Mist<br />
Waist: Girdle of the Diligent<br />
Back: Aegis of Life<br />
Weapon: Springwood Club<br />
Shield: Charred Guardian Shield<br />
Ranged: Medicine Totem<br />
<br />
Pre-planar Wish List:<br />
Left Finger: Platinum Jasper Ring (would like Goblin Tear Ring)<br />
Right Finger: Platinum Jasper Ring (would like Golem Tear Ring)<br />
Neck: Chrysoberyl Talisman (Would like a Necklace of Superiority)<br />
<br />
Head: Runed Circlet (waiting for EM)<br />
Chest: Quest (waiting for EM)<br />
Legs: Quest (waiting for EM)<br />
Arms: Quest (waiting for EM)<br />
Right Bracer: Quest (waiting for EM)<br />
<br />
Currently have 178 wis. The way I figure it, if I get the rest of my EM suit, I will have 198 wis. And, if I get that necklace, I will have 200 wis. I am considering doing the Paw quest, just to have it for those rough nights, but I don't like the idea of holding a doll.<br />
<br />
Now, if Nagafen had dropped the Medicine Totem, no one would have complained, would they? But, I traded the bladestopper to another cleric who has never had the luck to win one on his own. Everyone comes out happy. Except those who are so greedy they think I shouldn't have gotten anything. Those are the people who wish THEY had won. They aren't mad cause I traded it, they are mad cause I won and they didn'.<br />

I think the people complaining must have lost out on an item due to poor rolling rules and are bitter. =) Let me tell you, my main is a warrior, and warriors constantly get screwed out of items by casters (farmers) who have no use for it other than to sell it. It happens, it sucks, but it happens none the less. Just put it behind you. In any case, that's not what happened here, so nobody has any reason to complain in my opinion.<br />

No Dik, people are upset that you'd advertise an item for trade the SAME DAY that you won it.   If you want to talk about greed:<br />
<br />
-Who was the cleric who whined and bitched, then got flamed by everyone in hate when he couldn't put himself into a second lotto that day, when others had not won anything yet?<br />
<br />
-Who was the cleric who bitched that a certain uber guild wouldn't let *him* (someone who they didn't even know) mooch off their hard work in hate when they were up there?<br />
<br />
-Who is the cleric who will probably put himself into another bladestopper lotto the next naggy raid, then promptly trade it away again?</div></div><hr />

I think all parties need to sit back, relax, drink a beer, watch a little Mork and Mindy on channel... well you get the point...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I would have been surprised to be told to roll for such an item.<br />
<br />
I say good luck to you.  I missed out on a sharkbone hammer - I was angry for all of 30 seconds.  I then realised that I would be losing lots of AC and some Wis if I used it instead of my Paw.  One day I may find something to convince me to melee again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't whine and bitch, I mearly said I didn't think a default win should count. That getting an item that no one wanted should mean I didn't get a chance to lotto for a slightly more useful piece (like the legs or BP).<br />
<br />
 -Who was the cleric who bitched that a certain uber guild wouldn't let *him* (someone who they didn't even know) mooch off their hard work in hate when they were up there?<br />
<br />
Heh, most of them know me, and anyone who has ever grouped with me knows I don't mooch or shirk my duties. I use Naltron almost exclusivly now. I over buff my group when possible. I was willing to put in my time, my effort, my &quot;hard work&quot;. I was not allowed to go, simply because I wasn't in that guild, and because of that, something I would have found useful had to rot away. <br />
<br />
I got invited to a Hate raid last week, and I got a tele up the night before. There was another raid that was just finishing up and ready to charge Inno. I offered my service for Inno, or offered to simply camp. They ASKED me to sit quietly on the SW corner wall just in case they needed a cleric for CR.<br />
<br />
 -Who is the cleric who will probably put himself into another bladestopper lotto the next naggy raid, then promptly trade it away again?<br />
<br />
Hey, if I get a tell out of the blue, from someone asking me to go on a Naggy raid (i.e. a PICK UP GROUP, then you damn straight I'll be lottoing for SOMETHING. I have been to too many dragon raids that ended up with MULTIPLE deaths and once or twice a hard CR. I deserve a chance for something out of it, even if it is &quot;trade bait&quot;. Again, anyone who has been on a raid with me knows I do not shirk my duties. I don't think Pinzarn is &quot;good enough&quot;. I am not afraid to get up under Naggy and do my job. If it were a scheduled event with friends that went expecting certain people to get certain items, then I would NOT want anything out of the raid. But a PICK UP raid is a whole different ball game.<br />
<br />
Now, judgeing by your post, I'll bet my left testicle you never read more than the first 2 or 3 lines of any post, so you never get the whole story. You get the wrong idea about something and turn it into gospel. I'll bet you don't even read this part, as you probably got bored after the first quote. So, this is probably a waste of time. However, on the off chance you DID read this far, I urge you to READ IT AGAIN, and make sure you understand it before you open your mouth and put you foot in it.<br />
