I would not want someone in my group, especially at this high level, that didn't know all the strategy invovled. Hey, maybe he's read this message board forever and has reserached the class.. but you're not going to be a good cleric level 54 cleric unless you play a cleric from 1-53.<br />
<br />
Granted... its not as bad as an Ebayer newbie.. he probably knows how to play... but this is a close 2nd in badness  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

I'd be much more afraid for the people grouping with the new enchanter than the new cleric.<br />
<br />
Clerics, well, there are a few tricks to pick up but at least they can go and practice in front of a mirror to a certain extent  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif I think the damage inflicted by a new-to-enchanter could be much more spectacular.<br />

<br />
try ghetto mezzing nearly every pull while wearing no armor and having a lot less health  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
also, i doubt this warrior with full Kael armor has a lot of experience ghetto mezzing with root.  who knows though, maybe he's played healers before (different server, different account).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">09-30-2001, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's not get too full of ourselves. Clerics don't need a lot of skill, it's mostly point and heal, and timing can be learned quickly. An enchanter is probably the best class to train for a cleric anyway, as they are sensitive to the responsibilities of support classes, certainly won't forget to be paranoid about his own enchanter, and is likely familiar with /assist keys as well as the more important spells in a cleric's arsenal. Being an EQ cleric is not that hard. Personally I'd worry more about being stuck with the new enchanter than the new cleric.</div></div><hr />

Sure, clerics in Velk and KC can be played like that, but IMHO every class and not just clerics and enchanters are better suited played from around scratch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johann</div><div class="date">09-30-2001, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chanters are much harder to play then Clerics.  I have 2 computers and play a chanter and a cleric at the same time (both level 57), not easy.  But Clerics are not that hard to play.<br />
<br />
&gt;A_new_enchanter: &quot;Ok I've mezzed everything guess my work is done now.&quot;&lt;<br />
<br />
Ok, now I must sieve, tash, slow (if no shaman), keep the main tanks speeded and keep sieving so the mob wont gate and reapply mez before it breaks so that the mob wont agro me, so the cleric doesnt waste mana on me.  Oh, gotta make sure everyone has clarity II, buffs and also make sure I have mana!  Next, Oh no mez didnt stick!  Now Im agro!  Colon slant and then try to reapply mez!  Whew, cleric almost let me die.<br />
<br />
Cleric, I must heal and sit.  Buff and sit and heal.  Stun and sit and heal.<br />

<br />
&quot;Thank god you woke up, now I know why clerics get ulcers&quot;<br />
<br />
Now admittedly PoG was seriously buggy at the time, for some unknown reason everything was off it's pathing and sprites and those wisp things were wandering into camp every 3 or 4 minutes.  The treahs were clumping together a lot and Ail the Elder (sp?) had a tendency to wander off it's pathing and into our camp.  Not much you can do when your whole raid has suddenly been hit with AoE silence.<br />

<br />
oki yes yes. I have er MET the enchenter /bow<br />
yes we ah were in Seb together the other day..  It wasn't pretty.. oh my..<br />
<br />
well first, we found out that he was a newbie cause like he wouldn't give us casters our C1,  apparently the owner before him had breeze up buffing newbies and well, you know, we double checked his level /who enc..  and sure nuff he could cast it.. So we ask a few more times..<br />
<br />
All we get is breeze.. (oki, now, I'll get back to that)..<br />
<br />
Now since I only got this breeze see, I ask for the gift of magic, cause I am going to need some real magic to make this mana spread..<br />
and so he tells us it's not a worth while spell..  /cleric /wizard and /druid get worried.<br />
<br />
Oki so we get ourselves all buffed up, and I am doing around of symbols.. /giggles<br />
<br />
*chanter says* oh don't forget Pinzarn on me k?<br />
<br />
*cleric looks to warrior baffled*<br />
*warrior looks to cleric /shrug*<br />
<br />
So we continue and I get the symbols on everyone.. <br />
<br />
/wizard tells you : are you sure we want to do this?<br />
/you tell wizard : Maybe he didn't realize what he said?<br />
/wizard tells you : You braver then I am.<br />
/you tell wizard : I am a fairly good cleric.<br />
/wizard tells you : It's not you I am worried about.<br />
<br />
We call our camp. Easy enough right?<br />
<br />
I figure with newbie chanter we would have pyramid or some easy camp. Right? Wrong..<br />
<br />
Chanter says : Moving to illis jails.<br />
<br />
at this point the group is quiet..<br />
/wizard tells group :That's where we are going?<br />
/chanter says : Sure we will be good there.<br />
<br />
I double check his level again (51).. oki<br />
we are dead.  I try to explain that while he might have the spell capacity to take Illis jails, he doesn't have the level to mez half the stuff down there. <br />
<br />
/chanter says : been there lots of times, stuff blue. <br />
/group is quiet at this. I could hear the tells rustling back and forth. <br />
<br />
/wizard says : Is there another chanter available? <br />
/you tell wizard : Not my group, it's his.<br />
/wizard says : oh. damn<br />
 <br />
Oki so we get down there amidst a bit of arguing about the spells that we still would like to have, and a few bumps and bruises as this Newb still doesn't understand that he suppose to buff while he mezzes.. (we figure that's what he suppose to do anyway, but we aren't too sure)  <br />
So now like I am standing at 25m, as the warrior does his pull, and well I mention to the warrior that mana is low right? And I try to explain that I can't keep up mana with the pull rate.<br />
<br />
So the warrior looks at me and says I pull like this all the time.  He says your 55 what's wrong with Mana. <br />
I say er 25m is what's wrong and you got to wait.<br />
<br />
Oki at this point we are just near the stairs we have fought oh say 5 froggies.. and chanter has eatten up most of my mana due to &quot;resists&quot;.. /giggle<br />
<br />
/warrior bonks cleric on the head and says to med.<br />
<br />
I say what does it look like I am doing? <br />
the chanter at this point picks this time to look at me and say : Why is your mana low?<br />
<br />
So I explain that breeze doesn't allow for fast mana regen as oh say C2 and that not having a chance to med up after buffs left me pretty empty and then the Enchanter being a tank is not a good idea at this stage in the game.<br />
<br />
Newbie chanter says Oh I always do this..<br />
<br />
Druid says I hope not. LOL<br />
<br />
Warrior says Oh well you catch up.<br />
and continues on down the ramp to B1.<br />
brings in 3 more and two more heals on the chanter leaves me now oom..<br />
<br />
So I call OOm.<br />
chanter gets pissed.<br />
Warrior gets pissed<br />
and druid says OOM.<br />
I laugh at this point and wizard says saving mana for evac.<br />
<br />
Oki we get those dispatched and the group seems determined to go to illis jails, so we pop down in the water and rush in to the opening room when WOOPS chanter runs by the door and agro's 4 mobs, just 4. Would have been just peachy keen if he had not been resisted on all of them. Oh and did I mention I was OOM?????<br />
<br />
So yes they all died but the Monk who up til this point had been quiet. Once I had popped back up to the tomatoe, he says:<br />
And tell me why we came down here with him???<br />
<br />
<br />
Well that's a brief synopsis of what happen.<br />
now there was alot more details..<br />
But hehe I had to bring it up when you said trading enchanter..... OMG.<br />
<br />
Don't do it..<br />
run away, run away fast as you can!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">10-01-2001, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ork - the point I was trying to make, is that anyone who has ghetto mezzed will know about timing spells on mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone as a cleric who has also mok'd each mob will know all about casting a particular spell at each mob (does it matter if its tash, slow or mark of karn?).<br />
<br />
Any cleric will know all about buffing different characters with different buffs dependant on their role in the group.<br />
<br />
As such I think I would be capable of playing a chanter with minimum practice (say a week of play) to an acceptable standard.  The hardest thing would be in learning what individual spells are called.</div></div><hr />
