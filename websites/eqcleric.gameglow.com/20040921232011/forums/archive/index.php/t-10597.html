I found Lower Guk rather camped, but I did find a nice spot in upper guk that can be soloed by a 33 cleric. Theres 2 frogs right at the Live side zone nearest the ancient crock. Once you stagger them you'll have no problem, so long as you don't let em run. I went from 33 to 35 here in no time. You don't get to take andvantage of your undead spells, but on the plus side this spot is always empty and the zone is only two steps away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll have to check that again, we pulled that while camping the croc once, I thought 3 came.<br />
<br />
But yeah, it is a great spot, can zone into lguk and theres never anything at the zone to hurt you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">05-24-2000, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I and my buddy went to check out these frogs.  Actually, we both died  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif But that's another story. From what I can tell- it appears there are two sitting on the waters edge across from the ac spot.  When I attemted to zone, Leo died. The zone is watery and I guess his swimming skill must not be high enough.  It also looks like aggroing these guys would aggro the room next to it ( the one with the y-shaped planks going over the water.  Two or three froggies sit in the center).<br />
<br />
So- has anybody worked this spot that can give me additional details?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
