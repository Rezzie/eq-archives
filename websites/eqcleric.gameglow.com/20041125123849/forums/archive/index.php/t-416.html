<br />
I have just recently started a Cleric on my server and I am looking for any advise you might be able to give me on the little nuances of playing a cleric.<br />
<br />
You see the reason I am creating a cleric is because the guild I am a part of has a shortage of clerics and it has begun to be a problem when trying to organize different events. <br />
<br />
So, yes this character will be a bit twinked and I will be trying to powerlevel him up a bit so that he can be useful to the raid level people in the guild. <br />
<br />
I have played a ranger up to lv 40 and he will remain my primary character so I do know the rules of survival in EQ, but I am sure that the Cleric point of view is MUCH different than what I got as a Ranger. <br />
<br />
I am am an open book guys  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif Any and all info that will allow me to play the class well I will gladly accept and will be most grateful for. Also, I hope that I can find a little Niche in this great community. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time and your consideration.<br />

The cleric guild on the front page of the forum, is a great place to start.  It lays out a LOT of very useful information about a lot of different topic.  I would suggest you read it and then ask questions based upon the guide.<br />

<br />
You will need to med through some battles, especially after level 15 or so.<br />
<br />
In many cases, preventing damage is just as good or better than Healing it up. Buffs keep the party alive, and reduce the number of heals required. Chain Stunning at higher levels can keep a single creature's damage output almost to nothing.<br />
<br />
I would strongly advise playing at least 1 full level un powerlevelled in each spell set so that you get used to what spells are needed when, group dynamics, etc. If you are powerleveled straight through, it's gonna be tough to understand what needs to be done in what situations.<br />
<br />
The best friends you can have are an enchanter and a Tank who is good at keeping things off of you and the enchanter. If you have a chance to make any sort of regular group, I would strongly advise an enchanter and warrior/pal/sk as teammates.<br />

<br />
Here are a few tips from my experience:<br />
<br />
1.  Know your spells.  Sites like castersrealm.com are a fantastic resource for getting the scoop on what each spells offers.  I made a chart that I add to that lists spell description, mana cost, casting time, and class of spell.  Call me anal, but it really is useful.<br />
<br />
2.  Getting powerleveled is a great time to get your one handed blunt and dodge scores up.  Although I don't do it very often, it is nice to be able to hit every once in a while!  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
3.  If you want to be a battle cleric, please let your group know before you join.  Ack..no flames guys!!  In the past few weeks I have heard more complaining from friends in the new lands about clerics that are too busy hitting and not healing party members.<br />
<br />
4.  Divine Aura and Divine Barrier are your friends...I suggest you keep them up at all times.  I can't tell you how many times I've been saved by casting them when the call to zone has been issued.<br />
<br />
5.  Don't wait too long to heal your tanks.  Not only is this important so that you keep them alive, but strange as this might sound, it can build a bond between the party.  When I'm playing the role of healer, my tanks know that I'm going to do everything in my power to keep them as close to full health as possible. More times than not, we (as a party) end up having a lot more fun because the fighters aren't wondering if I'm going to remember to heal them, and I'm not wondering if they are going to protect me if I get attacked.<br />
Serious here...take care of your tanks and you increase your odds of the tanks taking care of you.<br />
<br />
6.  Buff em all.  The added AC and HPs your buffs add really do make a difference.  Now, some people don't agree with the following statement, but I also buff pets.  Your choice on the pets.<br />
And if some tough-guy tank tells you &quot;I don't need any buffs' don't pay attention.<br />
Something else you might want to consider:  let's say you're in DC zone waiting on some friends so you can go into Unrest.  Go ahead and toss out a few heals and buffs on others in the zone.  This does two things.  It educates other players about the abilities of the Cleric class (not joking) and it makes friends.<br />
<br />
Most of all have fun!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fycksir</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a ton of good advice in the character creation guides on this and other sites, read them and learn from them.<br />
<br />
But...beyond the tactics there is something equally important..its the &quot;stress&quot; of being a cleric.  Groups live and die by your actions, being a higher lev ranger you already know what its like at the recieving end of a Hail-Mary heal but its different being the caster of that heal.  <br />
<br />
I guess I could say &quot;stay calm and get back on your but to med more&quot;.  Take charge of the pacing of the pulls, if you group is weak say you have less mana than you do to slow things down, if the group is strong crack the whip a bit.  Don't let others tell you who/when/what to buff, you make the call, and use you mana how you see it being most effective.<br />
<br />
You will have people die on you, sometimes its yours or the groups fault, just try a best you can not to have it be your fault, IE nuking away your mana.  <br />
<br />
One other thing, and I know it's cold, but if you get into a pick-up group that sucks LEAVE IT.  They will die and so will you, but you will get the blame.  Clerics are a blast I would only have one char if I started a cleric first!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Learnrod</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two words Vasos: Mana Efficiency!<br />
<br />
As a Cleric you live and your Group lives on your efficient use of your available mana pool.  Healing takes lots of mana, stunning doesn't!  If you can keep the MOPs stunned they don't deliver damage to your Group and you don't have to heal, if your Group is buffed you have put &quot;mana in the bank&quot; pre- battle and therefore have to use less while engaged.<br />
<br />
Healing efficiently is an art form, you have to develop a sense of when to heal and what level heal to use, you've got it right when every heal goes up to all but that last pixel of red on your targets health bar.  NO mana wasted.<br />
<br />
Being a Cleric is stressful, give your self a break, you WILL lose people.  If you did the best you could don't feel too bad about it.  When you are the healer in a Group it is a BIG responsibility you can't go AFK when you want, only when your Group is safe.  If a warrior fails to get a critical hit, NOBODY notices.  If a wizard fails to throw a nuke on time, NOBODY notices.  If you goof on healing and somebody dies, EVERYBODY, and I mean EVERBODY, notices!  Don't let it burn you out!<br />
<br />
A few last very important words:  Don't forget to have fun!<br />
<br />
Welcome to our ranks and may your mana bar never go empty!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samsara</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think one of the best things a cleric (or any class, really, but especially a cleric) can do when in a group is communicate!<br />
<br />
If you're going to use a big heal on a tank and they're the nervous type, a quick &quot;Will complete heal at two bubbles, Tankguy&quot; goes a long way toward making them feel more comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Resolution coming around&quot; lets people know you haven't forgotten to buff them but that you're trying to preserve a bit of mana for fights.  Giving a quick mana bulletin helps tremendously as well.<br />
<br />
Communication is key not just during battles, but also when forming up.  Are you one of two  or more clerics?  Decide how/whether you will divide up duties ahead of time, who will be primary healer or who will be responsible for healing which party members -- stuff like that.  Establish guidelines other group members can use -- for example, if you and another class share a spell, decide who will assume duty for that spell (e.g. fear, extinguish fatigue, nullify magic, etc.) so the other can clear a spot in their spell lineup.<br />
<br />
Communication is key, not to mention one of the most fun parts of the game  =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hubris</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Timing heals is very important too. Get to know how long each heal takes to cast, how much it heals, and how fast the mob is dealing the damage. It's all a juggling act.<br />
<br />
When I'm in a group with another cleric, the lower level cleric will become primary healer while the higher level one will become secondary healer and buffer/nuker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vasos</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys,<br />
<br />
I have read through the player guides posted up on this site and I have briefly looked through some of the last few pages of threads here to kinda get a feel for things. I do find that a lot of the subjects and sugestions are very similar to what I came in with though I did learn a few things here and there. <br />
<br />
I guess I should make little not ehere on my statement that I am going to try and briefly Powerlevel this guy up. Granted I will try to do this a little bit but I am not the kind of person who asks for help easily.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif Call me crazy but I feel bad when I have to impose on someone or make them go out of their way for anything. <br />
<br />
I am one of those guys who debates for 5 mins  whether or not I wont cause to much of problem before sending a tell to the local Reser or to a Tper whether they are in guild or not. So my powerleveling will be at a minimum even though I have already had several people offer to help. I plan of doing most of the work myself also because I do not want anyone telling me that I didn't earn my way up to my levels. If I powerlevel straight through they would be right and I don't want that. <br />
<br />
Anyway, back on topic. What I am looking for are the little nuances of being a cleric and maybe some special insights you might have had as being a cleric. For instance, let me give you a general run down of what life is like for me as a Ranger. Maybe you can help me out by pointing out similarities or diffeences between the two classes. That way I can put it into perspective if you will.<br />
<br />
Life as a Ranger is a thinking man's class. To be a ranger you have to rely on a lot of pre-planning, strategy, and you have to be very aware of what everyone in your group is doing. Even those who are not in your group but are in your general area. If you don't, you end up dead and quite possibly your whole group too.<br />
<br />
The role of a Ranger evolves over their career. When you start out you are one of the best classes to have around. Your combat and defensive skills are right on par with the mega tanks and you have several nice skills to throw in as well. Track, which is awesome up till lv 18 or so, and when you hit lv 9 you have spells which might even put a ranger up above any other melee class in the game till about lv 15 or so. At this point you start to notice having a lower possible AC and less HP. Also, you have not recieved Dual Weild yet. Up to this point your role is that of Main tank and more often than not Puller/party leader. You can almost do anything at this stage of the game. <br />
<br />
After level 15 you start to slide into the role of secondary tank and damage dealer. You are most likely still the puller of the group but you hand over the incoming mobs to the warrior first chance you get. This is also where you start learning to develope strategies to make the best use of your abilities. This Role lasts till you hit about lv 30 or so. <br />
<br />
After level 30 you don't want any part of tanking period. Low HP and AC makes it hard to stay alive if you tank much. You can do it in a pinch but not recomended. You start to shift your focus to doing damage, crowd control, keeping mobs off casters, and if you have become good at it (and most rangers are very good) the puller. <br />
<br />
Quick note about being a puller. Being a cleric I am not sure how much you guys can relate to the guy who does the puling. I think it might help both you guys and the puller for everyone to understand what both is dealing with. Kinda why I am doing this in the first place. I want to understand what your day to day life is like and I hope maybe I can give you some understanding on what mine is like too. <br />
<br />
Here is a guide I wrote for a young Ranger at the Ranger's Glade site run by Sunmoon. It covers nearly all the responsibilities that come with the position. I posted several replies to this persons question and I will post all of them in order.<br />
<br />
Cut and pasted:<br />
Well the best way to learn is to experiment.  Sorry but as they say there is no teacher quite like....<br />
<br />
Anyway, my best advice is to study your opponents/potential prey and watch to see what their pathing is, how many other mobs are nearby, and relative levels of said MOBS. <br />
<br />
One thing that is invaluable is changing your field of view and rotate it around you. This way you can sometimes see MOBS that are around corners that you never knew were there. Bind sight is also very useful for this. <br />
<br />
And of course try to use Invisibility to do some scouting. Just be careful of those things that can see through it. <br />
<br />
Alwasy try to move slowly. Never ever run headfirst into a room. Always try and poke your nose in and get a good look at things while staying out of Aggro range. <br />
<br />
And probably the best thing you can do if you are in an outside zone (Unrest is an outdoor zone BTW) is use liberal amounts of Harmony. This is a pullers dream spell. Used correctly it can make pulling a breaze in almost any situation.<br />
<br />
Once again though it will take lots of experimenting and experience to get it right. Once you have it down though it should not be that bad. <br />
<br />
Good luck to you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I should clarify a little here.<br />
<br />
Pulling is an artform. One of the most elegant and respected art forms of our time.  Seems a bit cheesy but when you have that kind of mindset you tend to try and outdo yourself time after time and you look to see how every pull you make could be made better.<br />
<br />
I wil try and relate a most of what I have learned and give a general strategy when pulling.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the purpose of the pull? It is to bring a MOB or MOBS back to your group so that they can be killed, without bringing<br />
anything more than you planned for.<br />
<br />
What are the dangers associated with Pulling? If you are pulling it usually means you are going solo at it. Your group waits while you explore and so the chances that you will die as opposed to the rest of your group are much greater. Pulling too much. Getting caught in train. Basically the dangers are that you have an increased chance of death over any other member of your party.<br />
<br />
Ideal pull? An ideal pull is one where you bring enough mobs back to your party that the fight lasts about one minute to kill all the MOBS and to give enough challenge to the group that they are not sitting around waiting for you. Whether the fight be with a single mob or a group it makes no differnece. The group should be fighting as fast as it can handle to make the best exp. However, there is a fine line between a perfect pull and a train. <br />
<br />
How do you go about making that perfect pull? This requires a detailed answer. There is never any one answer though. Just some general guidelines to follow. The rest of it is determined by your personal judgement and abilities.<br />
<br />
Be aware of exactly how much your group can handle and how much is too much. Any mistake here and you can cost everyone their lives. Make sure you know this is well as you can. <br />
<br />
Make sure you know your prey inside and out. The more you know about what you are fighting the easier things will become. Must learn things like pathing routes when pulled, how large aggro radiuses are, which mobs are casters and which are melee, approx level and toughness of said MOB(s), how fast they run/pursue you, what resistances they have if any, etc.<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the lay of the land so to speak. Knowledge of your surroundings is of the greatest importance. This includes things like Roaming patterns to various Mobs, locations of the nearest Zone point/safe spot(for when you make a bad pull you or your group needs to know where to go), various features of the zone geography which might cause problems when running a mob back to your group, various geography features that may be used to your advantage when pulling back to your group, and so on. <br />
<br />
Primary objectives: Single out an appropriate number of MOBS to bring back to your group. Then make sure you don't get anything else on the way back again. Don't die in the process. <br />
<br />
Secondary objectives: Do as much damage as you can to a MOB or MOBS before returning to your group, set up for later pulls by using strategy on which mobs to pull at which time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do whatever you can to accomplish as many objectives as you can as long as you put the primary objectives as highest priority. Don't<br />
even worry about doing any damage to a pulled mob on the way back if it will compromise your pull in any way. <br />
<br />
Some things that will work are using snare to pull if you don't have Sow on. If you have Sow don't snare and proceed as follows. This will allow to you to cast/bowkite a little back to your group. But do not do this through high traffic areas. You wil most likely get a few more MOBS in the process and start a train.<br />
<br />
Casting a DOT in a pull is ideal if you are high enough level to cast it. This is essentialy free damage to the mob on the way back. After the initial cast it requires no more effort to do damage. <br />
<br />
If in an outdoor zone USE HARMONY. As much as possible. Remember it is better to go overboard in casting Harmony then to not cast it enough times. Use it to break otherwise impossible pulls into a managable and profitable series of skirmishes. Be careful though as there are limitations to harmony that you must learn. Harmony reduces aggro ranges only. If you Harmony a mob and pull another mob who runs close enough or directly over the first mob it will still aggro. Learn the pathing of each mob in a pull and be guided accordingly. Some spawns are just not possible to seperate becuase of pathing and proximity. Learn which ones these are and then make sure you save them for last or prepare for them seperately from all other pulls. <br />
<br />
And if you are the puller, INSIST that you choose where the group fights at. I.e the spot you want to pull to. If you are pulling you need to be most familair with the area and also you need a spot where you will feel most comfortable. Also make sure that whatever spot you pick is as safe as possible. <br />
<br />
Have fun and good luck to you.<br />
************<br />
End Cut and Paste.<br />
<br />
I include that because pulling is such a large part of a Ranger's life and not many people realize all that has to go into pulling. One statement I heard someone say once is very astute. A puller has to know as much as he can about every class in his group, sometimes better than they know their own class. I think because Rangers have to think so much about eveything they do and becuase they bear so much responsibility on their shoulders that it takes a special kind of person to play one. <br />
<br />
I am sure that if you did a who all Ranger on your server you would see a TON of Rangers under lv 25 or so. After this they start dropping like flies becuase they do not have the patience or the determination to stick it out through the bad times. <br />
<br />
I don't mean this to sound elitist but I am rather proud of what I have accomplished as a Ranger and I am proud to call myself one. We have a very close knit community that goes beyond servers. We all look out for one another like family and that is another thing I like about the class.<br />
<br />
Anyway, basically the higher level you get the more a ranger's role changes to that of a Damage dealer and away from being a Tank. Right now, the Ranger class is having a huge problem with the post 45 50 game due to the fact that we taunt way too much for our own good without even trying. Usually gets us killed and thrown out of groups rather quick but this is neither the time nor the place to get in to that. <br />
<br />
My day to day experiences in Norrath can be summed up by saying that I have had to carefully analyse every situation I have ever gone into. I have done some amazing things with the abilities that I have been given but only through very careful planning and sometimes months of preperation before hand. When I am in a group I take the responsibilities put upon me very seriously and I have the mentality that I would rather die myself than let another go down to to a mistake on our part. Especially casters.<br />
<br />
A common saying among the Ranger community is &quot;Not on my watch&quot;. This refers to a Healer or a Caster that dies in a group. Not on my watch means that as long as I am in a group that Caster or Healer will not die while I am still alive. <br />
<br />
We take pride in being able to take a bad situation and turn them around to make a resounding victory. A Ranger played right can do this when everyone else has lost hope. Not through soloing tons of things cause we can't, but rather useing our abilities to help people do their own jobs better than before. <br />
<br />
Anyway, that is rather long winded but I hope I gave you guys an insight into what life in Norrath is like for a Ranger. <br />
<br />
My questions are:<br />
<br />
How does being a cleric( and I have become emergency healer once in a while even though my own heals are not much to consider. I played cleric in  the spider room in Lower Guk at 35) compare to the responsibilities as a puller?<br />
<br />
What is your general outlook on going into group situations?<br />
<br />
Are there any tricks of the trade or special little strategies that work well in given situations? For instance, as a Ranger I can use Root to peel and root in a corner if we do not have an enchanter in the group. <br />
<br />
Finally, If you could describe the cleric class to someone who is new and trying to start out ( me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif) what would you say?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time guys. <br />
<br />
One final note. I am going out of town tonight and wont get a chance to check back till next Friday. If I don't respond to someone's questions that is the reason. And a BIG congrats to anyone who actualy read down this far!  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harbron</div><div class="date">07-01-2000, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Th' biggest diff'rence b'tween clerics an' rangers be mobility.  Rangers very often be pullers.  Clerics almos' never be pullers.  We be at th' group's spot sittin' on our backside med'tatin' an' tryin' not t' git aggroed.<br />
<br />
We also be findin' it very useful t' be knowin' what ever' member 'f our group kin be doin'.  Find out who kin be doin' crowd c'ntrol, an' more 'mportantly, which ones actually be plannin' t'.  Like rangers we sometimes be usin' Root 'r Enstill as a form 'f crowd c'ntrol.<br />
<br />
When there be nobody with a form 'f snare, we also mebbee r'spons'ble fer stoppin' runners with Stun 'r Root.  Ye've prob'ly bin seein' that very little as a ranger 'nless ye be grouped with somebody who bin makin' m'stakes.<br />
<br />
A good cleric'll start swappin' 'is spells 'roun' t' be adjustin' t' what ye be fightin' an' who else be in th' group.  Sometimes I be keepin' three heals up, but there've bin times when it jus' bin one.  Sometimes I be havin' three stuns up, but other times I be droppin' all 'f 'em.<br />
<br />
Clerics be showin' even greater pr'tectiveness 'f their 'nchanters than ye be showin' towards healers an' casters.  Th' 'nchanter an' th' cleric be keepin' th' group alive.  Mos' clerics an' 'nchanters be who be good be automatically be unnerstandin' how t' git critters off th' other one quickly an' easily.  Given a choice, I be pr'ferrin' t' let th' 'nchanter be gittin' th' critter off me 'nstead 'f th' tank be doin' it.<br />
<br />
As a cleric, I'd rather th' critter be aggroed on me than on a pure caster.  I be wearin' better armor an' be packin' a better set 'f spells t' be savin' me own life.  I also be findin' that mos' tanks be more r'sponsive t' th' healer bein' in danger 'nstead 'f th' nuker.  Heh.<br />
<br />
Clerics be r'spectin' good pullers.  We be pr'ferrin' th' pulls that dinnae be 'xhaustin' our mana.  Most 'f us be mana misers.  We be spendin' mana in th' most economical way poss'ble.  I often be pr'ferrin' a pull that be slightly smaller'n th' rest 'f me group be likin'.<br />
<br />
Clerics an' 'nchanters be th' ones best knowin' how well th' fight be goin'.  We be havin' a good idea how we be spacin' out our mana 'cross a big fight.  If'n th' cleric an' th' 'nchanter both be tellin' ye t' run 'r evac, they be right.  If'n jus' one 'f 'em be tellin' ye that ye be fine, they prob'ly be right.<br />
<br />
Clerics be tendin' t' git upset if'n someone be takin' more damage then be necessary, whether it be a caster that be overburnin' 'r a ranger that be tauntin' 'r a druid that be tankin'.  In our way 'f seein' thin's, ye be wastin' our mana which kin be used t' keep th' rest 'f th' group alive later on.<br />
<br />
This only be a little bit 'f our p'rspective, but it'll be givin' ye some insight int' 'ow we be lookin' at th' way a group be workin'.<br />
