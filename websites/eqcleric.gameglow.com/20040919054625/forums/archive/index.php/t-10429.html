If you want to solo/power level pick the undead zones since cleric get very powerful undead spells chessboard in butcher block, befallen in west commons (then at 14 hit unrest)<br />
<br />
But if you want to start learning you grouping skills go to all the popular places to level oasis, nro derv groups, east common orc groups, crushbone off of greater faydwer.<br />
<br />
Its up to you. You dont have to do one or the other. You can do a little pl, then group, then back again.  (Now i know why I didnt see a cleric hardly till I was 40, its was because they were in all teh undead zones  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/cool.gif</div></div><hr />
