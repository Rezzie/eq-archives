How many people were in the assassin/supplier room? ONE... then finally that level 50 necro let a friend in the room -- ooh, now TWO.  Savant room -- yes, a soloing level 50 there too.<br />
<br />
It was truly sad -- there was a full group of 6 camping the GIB because there was nowhere else to go!  And those high level folks were quite vehement in defending their turf -- said they &quot;needed&quot; the items for their twinks (more likely E-Bay, for the supplier room)  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
I realize that it is tough to police spawns, but surely they could come up with some way to stop this incredibly frustrating and terribly selfish sort of behavior?<br />
<br />
Even making selling on e-bay a bannable offense, and then cancelling their accounts would help!<br />

I don't advocate taking spawns from groups that are legitamatly camping for exp and items they need. I do encorage people to assert themselves against item farming spawn hogs though. If the (explative deleated) wants to make some extra pocket change, he can go get a damn job.<br />

The only place for a level 50 to really get excitement at is either a dragon raid or a planes raid...and you can't just waltz into a dragons zone or the planes and get a group.  It takes hours of planning to put one of those together and then hours to complete it.  So what does a level 50 do if they aren't involved in something like that..they are gonna camp something they know is easy to kill that gives good items.  Platinum is worthless at high levels but items always trade well.  I'm sure you are very correct about some of it getting sold on Ebay too.  The new expansion in April is probably the only thing that will save EQ, finally the level 50 characters will have somewhere new to go that they can explore in loose groups without having to mount a major expedition.  Hopefully that will clear them out of dungeons like Solb and Lower Guk.  Until then you might as well accept the fact that higher level players basically don't have a lot of options on places to go and will more than likely be sitting on some green con mob that drops an item...just to kill time.  I wish I had a better answer but that's just the reality of it.<br />

<br />
Don't take $%#^ from a 50th level solo camper. I never do and I expect when 50th if I am solo camping I will leave for a full group of 30s or 40s to take the camp without a problem.<br />
<br />
There are things for these 50s to do, if they can't get in a group because they are sociopathic thats their psycologists problem.<br />

I have outgunned necros 10 levels above me more than once when contesting a single MOB.  Unless the MOB is undead they have no real DD other than the lifetap series of spells.<br />
<br />
I agree with some of the previous posts, it is ludicrous to leave that 50 necro in there alone.  Move in with your group and take the spawn.  You'd only lose if the 50 necro brought in some 50 wizzie friends.........<br />

Thats right,they get thier buddies to come and show you that &quot;might makes right&quot;. =(<br />

I have missed out on 3 different EXG spawns becasue some high level joker was inbetween SolB camps/lists and decided to grab some quick, sellable loot.  It's hard for me to care about how high levels feel, since very few care about me.  I agree there isn't many places for high levels to go (and perhaps that should be addressed), but they shouldn't move in on our lower level places bacause of this.  I try and help people who are lower than me, but that is my personality.  I understand that some people don't want to help lower level people, and that is fine with me.  Just don't take away our spots or out loot.  We don't have the options higher levels do.<br />

I grped with 2 lvl 50's who js wanted a guano to spawn in solb. I was the healer and the only time we died was when someone trained several sonic bats and about 2 or 3 lava duct crawlers on us!!  It was nice experience and i got good loot as well!!!<br />

Thanks Vykdrago and Moonwraith!!!<br />
