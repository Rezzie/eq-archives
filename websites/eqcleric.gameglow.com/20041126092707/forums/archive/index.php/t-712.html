<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lady_Dark</div><div class="date">07-30-2000, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well they finally nerfed out pathetic pet you can no longer spend 4-6p on a pearl and keep it from killing itself =( I use to use this to clear away green trash that would attack me while I meded( all it could be used for) but now you can no longer cast death pack on it. I am starting to no longer enjoy this game is it just me ? I love being a healer I always have been in muds but Vernat seems to either have no clue about healers or just doesnt care</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe the next online RPG will treat healers better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">07-30-2000, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've got news for you all http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
geuss who is developing the next online RPG http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Thats right, the originators!!!! D&amp;D id making their own and it's about time. I love everquest but D&amp;D has the cleric right on!!!!<br />
There is a reason we have armour and weapons, we stand at the front line with our fellow warriors although we fight for our deity not our king. And here is the kick ass part, not only can you hook up to one of thier servers and play the adventures they have made or have online GMs give you quests BUT for the truly creative you can design your own campaign setting and be your own GM and either host a game from your computer and drop monsters and treasure when and were you need it, but you can also put it up on their servers and host poeple from around the world, you can also have multiple GMs. And D&amp;D clerics are the way they should be! http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
I love my cleric on EQ but there are a few things that need to be changed. And getting rid of our useless pet which we never should have gotten in the first place is retarded.<br />
Maybe they should put out a poll to see what we clerics want instead of going through all this crap. After all we are paying to play this game which means we pay their wages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Call me stupid but this was clearly a bug.  The pet seems like it is supposed to die after it has nothing left on its hate list.  If verant wanted us to have a chanter type pet we would have a chanter type pet.<br />
<br />
Sorry but we shouldn't whine about a bug fix.  Be gratiful for the time when it worked instead of complaining about it not working now.  Its like the supposed nerf of that item that had a necro mana regen spell on it (fright forge mask?) that was a bug, verant even went so far as to state right away that it was a bug and will be changed as soon as next data patch (which took a while) yet still people complained about the supposed nerf.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even shooting for any changes to the spell, but I'd love to hear what Abashi/verant have to say about it.</div></div><hr />
