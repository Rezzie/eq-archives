<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimsonsplat</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm Elizor Feystorm, Guild Liason and Strategic Raid officer of Lunar Shadows, and EQ addict since 2001.  We are starting a new program of semi-open weekly raids, designed to give unguilded and 'small-guild' players a shot at higher-level content.<br />
<br />
LS about having fun, setting goals, and achieving them. We raid 3-4 times a week and while we have fun, we are deadly serious about accomplishing our goals. The high end game is all built on discipline. If you're a willing student you'll learn a lot from us--if not stop reading now because you will be wasting our time and yours. <br />
<br />
If you're not disciplined or willing here is a word of advice: You won't reach the high end game. Period. <br />
<br />
The primary goal for us in hosting these weekly raids is finding competent players who may fit into the LS community.  Guilds as allies are also welcome, but we are allied with several guilds now. It is impossible to coordinate raiding among too many guilds, so new members are our priority. <br />
<br />
Now for the facts: <br />
<br />
1. Who: Unguilded players or members of small guilds - level 62+ (possibly as low as 58+, depending on target). <br />
<br />
2. When: Wed nights, @ 8:30pm EST  Be on time. Our goal is to form raids quickly and efficently. <br />
<br />
3. Where: Nexus - South Entrance by Guard Larren  Join chat channel LSRAID, announce your class, level, and guild, if any.  A coordinator will greet you and answer any questions. Direct all questions to the coodinator. Do not send tells the raid leader. <br />
<br />
4. Target: To be determined based on raid strength and mob availability. Candidates will include Luclin and lower tier POP bosses/minis. Expect to start small for the first week or two. <br />
<br />
5. Loot: All unguilded players will be awarded DKP with LS, as will any &quot;solo&quot; guilded players. You can use this in later raids to bid on drops. Any guild with 2 or more members present as of roll-taking will be included in an attendence-based randoming among the guilds. The winning guild is awarded the designated item for distribution to its members. If LS wins the loot, it is awarded based on the DKP system.  Link to full rules is below. <br />
<br />
6. Raid Discipline: Pay attention to the Raid Leader and follow all instructions. Disruptive or annoying players will be asked to leave. Following the raid, we will compile an informal listing of people/guilds that we would: <br />
<br />
a) consider for guild membership <br />
b) welcome to continue raiding at our weekly raids (or perhaps others)<br />
c) wish them good luck with the game <br />
<br />
Additional references: They're too long to be read easily, but anyone desiring a guild invite needs to know this stuff.. <br />
