<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throckjr</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I've been trying to trade my Cleric for one on Cazic, and after realizing that wouldn't work, I decide I'll keep Suudar where he is and get my friends to move to Rallos with me.  A couple people played the account and I noticed that I was in Solusek.  Cool, I'll get a group and take a shot at a RMB or Molten Cloak.  I log in AT THE NOBLE CAMP and 4 peeps are there lookin for a Cleric, HELLLO! Like 5 Kobolds spawn and the RMB Drops, I win the roll, the group breaks and I gate to Overthere with my nice new bracer.  (Thank god my friends don't know how to Bind, and this type of thing is quite exciting when you're not just exactly sure of where you are going to end up).  Get in a group at Fronteir Mountains and end up with a Mines of Nurga Group, we get a tell from a Ranger who's 35 and wants to know if he can join.  Sure no prob, a good puller with some aux heals.  We spend 5 and half hours in Nurga, all by ourselves a group of 5 and this Ranger's pullin stuff for us right and left.  What an awesome time!!!  Met some great people and right at the end we got a Burnyai Legion Gi.  So now I got a nice robe to hide my bracers.  <br />
 That group splits up and it's late so I head to Guk to try and finish my Paw.  Figuring late sunday night and the fungus might be lonely.  I trade a FBR to a guildmate to help me get the fungus.  It's open, and the Guk weed drops first time!!!  Sweet, what a night!!  Jojola shows up and wants to share the spawn so he can get his paw.  My guildmate has to leave, so cool, I'll share it with a druid, all I need is the drop for the copper ring now, shouldn't be a prob, Bracket Mildew drops second spawn, holy cow.  I'm doing so good that I feel guilty about leaving Guk to get my Paw and help Jojola out with a few mutants.  He gates us to Toxx to get the rings, and I remember that Verant reset factions, so much for all the time spent getting to Indifferent so I could get Maugrim.  <br />
 Well, not only did Jojola happily evac and invis and run back into Kerra with me.  He drug my corpse to the zone safely when I died , and didn't loot A THING!  Gated me to NK so I could get Vin and finish my Paw.  So, total score: Paw of Oppala, Runed Mithril Bracer and Burnyai Legion Gi.  Most importantly though, a GREAT time dieing and evacing with a fun and good-spirited Druid.  Was a truly frustrating and long ordeal, and seriously the fun, excitement and conversation outweighed the items.  Although they're nice too.<br />
 The Shadow Gypsies truly have the only worthwhile Carny on Rallos Zek.  Sorry Jo had to throw in the halfling slam.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
