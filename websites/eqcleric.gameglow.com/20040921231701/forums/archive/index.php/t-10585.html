<br />
The cyclopses near the Lake zone can be easily taken by a small group. I was killing ones yellow to me at 31 teamed with my 30 paladin companion. When we added a 29 druid with snare, we would usually finish the battle at around 70% mana. Almost every wrath hit for hull damage. Downtime to heal and med pretty closely matched the respawn time for the cyclops.<br />
<br />
Tarskuk, the named cyclops, is about 35 and required a second level 30 warrior for us to take down. I had to stay in pure healing mode when fighting Tarskuk.<br />

Becareful of people training clops and other nasties to the lake zone.  Got run over by a clops and ogrefiend one time, OUCH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistleburr</div><div class="date">01-11-2000, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Merpa - Cyclops loot is rather poor, once as low as 8cp (must have been the town beggar). I kept the tanks symboled, and the loot covered the cost of the stones (bloodstones available at the inn in the zone, BTW).<br />
<br />
The lizardmen are the placeholder spawns for cyclopses, so if you have a larger group and need to pull quicker be sure to clear out the lizzies.<br />
<br />
For outstanding loot in the zone, move over to the Hill Giant area. Average loot for a Giant was about 50pp in coin and usually an FS weapon.<br />
<br />
We took down HG's with a 31 Paladin, 31 Magician, and a 36 Shaman. No snare in that group so the pally and the dog and earth pets just stood and tanked with me chain healing. This is a risky way of fighting them, so buff everyone fully before attempting it. Have a plan for what to do when the Giant switches off the tank. We lost the shaman one time when he ran out of my healing range, since that was his reflex action...  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

If your fighting them in more then a 2 man group its way not worth it. The HG are another story. Going to try to take my usual group, 2 lv34 rng and me 33 to do hg. Might pick up a wizie. Wizzies are great for 2 things. evacs and NO ONE is better at knocking out that last chunk of health for the kill then them. If you ask me there really not that good for mid battle play. Just wind up in troubel and I have to save them. Very few wiz know how to space there spells out properly.</div></div><hr />

Soloing the Giant Skeletons was getting me more experience in a shorter amount of time.<br />
