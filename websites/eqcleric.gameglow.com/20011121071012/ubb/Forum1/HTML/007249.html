</FONT><HR>My guild has had some discussion about points in the past and decided not to use it.<P>For us, (and this may not be an issue for other guilds) we want to see great items in the hands of people who will *use* them to benefit the guild to the maximum.<P>In a point system, there is nothing you can do from stopping someone with alot of points from taking the most mega-mega item for thier lvl 2 twink, if they wish. From what I saw, most of my guild seemed to find that idea terrible.<P>I had a conversation once with a cleric in Afterlife (who also reads these boards, maybe he will feel free to comment? /hint /hint) and he said that the biggest problem is hoarding points.<P>Example: Let's say your guild is on Dragon faction and you are killing stuff in the Halls of Testing. You are a chain wearing class and you really really want your Skyshrine BP. To win the next chain BP that drops *outright* with no random, you must have more points than anyone else. <P>This means that for some random time (could be a long time, depending on random drops) you must not spend *any* points on anything that drops, even if no one else wants it and it's a dream item for you. Why? You have to maintain a point advantage over someone else in case the coveted Chain BP drops so you can win it outright.<P>For myself, a point system would almost be a tremendous advantage since I go to alot of events and the list of items I want is very tiny.<P>I guess it depends on your point of view.<P><P>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.alliliel.com" TARGET=_blank>Visit Alliliel's Homepage</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Points systems favor those that play alot and penilize those that can't. You may find that a lot of causal players will get annoyed and may leave. Also some folks will hoard points to get a very specfic items which can be difficult for others to get, you also may get to a point where low lvl gear rots cause no-one is willing to waste their points on it.<P>I recently joined one of the larger guilds on my server and they have a complex loot system. but it works well.<BR>The guild leader defaults 80% of the loot, it's assigned mostly by how much effort the person puts in and how much they play. So a Warrior who plays a lot gets all the good gear before anyone else who only plays on the weekend. The needs of the guild outweigh the needs of an individual.<BR>We also have random loot numbers and you have to earn them in order to roll on gravy and if you win you use up a point, stops the very lucky winning all the gravy.<BR>We also have the ability to choose 2 uber loot items. If it drops then you get it straight away, if more than one person has it on their list and is at the raid then it is randomed between them.<P>There is still loot arguments, espically over Sleepers Keys, but the guild leaders descision is final and if you don't like it there's the door. This guild is one of only 2 guilds that can go to Sleepers and generally kill the tough mobs, so if you want to be involved you live by the rules.<BR>The guild is ruled with an iron fist, 3 warnings in 3 months and you're gone.<BR>Sounds harsh, but in reality it's a well run, team orientated, goal focused guild, that is very good at killing "stuff".<P>My last guild nuked itself over loot. I think the key thing is to have a charter, have rules regarding loot, have penalties for argueing over loot/missbehavior/attendance and then enforce the rules.<P>The two largest guilds on BB have a default system, people know a lot of the loot goes to make the guild better. You have to decide as a guild whether you are a raiding guild or a bunch of people that raid occasionally and exp the rest of the time. Full time raiding guilds usally default (on BB anyway), part time raiders prolly should random and hope that the guys that play all the time will win better gear.<P>Anyway thats my thoughts, choosing a loot system is tough I hope you get it sorteed out  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR><P>------------------<BR>Antiseptik Biohazzard<BR>60th Dwarven Cleric<BR>Circle Of Legends<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I like my guild. we are small, and close knit, been together for ages. (since June, 1999)<P>The other day, I log in and see only 7 people on from my guild. 1 41 druid and the rest of us were 55+. Well, I was in Sebilis and there were 105 people in the zone. I turned on walk, and went from zone in to Pickler then from Pickler to Chef, then from Chef to King and didn't get attacked one time. So, we got together in guildchat and decided to do Chardock zoneout for awhile. We had a cleric, a warrior, a ranger, a bard, a rogue and a shaman.<P>While we were there, a Golem Tear ring dropped. All of us there who would use it, had one (myself having bought mine last week). So, we go down the list and decide that Khaen, a 55 druid in our guild, should get it, since he would use it and that is his primary character.<P>A short while later, a Sarnak Battle Shield dropped. Again, all of us there who could use it had one, so again, we sit down and decided that Bondolmer, 51 Shaman, should get that.<P>The point is, we decide together, as a guild, who is most deserving and/or most in need of an item, and that person gets it. No points, no favoritism, no greed. Just friends helping each other out. I have passed up rolling for items that I could have used at the time (Guardian Legs come to mind right off), because another person there needed them more then I did.<P>It's been decided long ago that the first oportunity for a Cleric BP in Hate or PoG will go to me. So far, we haven't had any drop. Am I the most in need? No, I have 190 WIS, and the highest AC of any cleric in our guild. Am I most deserving? Arguably, yes. 100 Hate raids, and the ONLY item from Hate that I do not have is the BP. I am also the highest level cleric in our guild. When I get one, I plan to pass my current BP (Frogluk Scale) to the guild to whoever needs it most. Probably young Kletus, a level 50 dwarf cleric who is still using BP of Constant.<P>I guess what it comes down to is, are you in a guild to get phat lewt, and to make sure you don't have to compete for your gear? If so, then yes, a point system will be needed.<P>Or are you in a guild where it's all friends helping each other out, trying to make sure everyone gets something they can use? If this is the case, then you don't need a point system. It should be obvious to you who needs what, and you will be giving that person what he/she needs.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>We have a point system and it's working beautifully really. Hell the example of us using it got the the 2nd, 3rd and 5th most powerful guilds using it too (4th tried).<P>We've killed, um. Too many things to count really. Only thing I still have track of is Tormax which is like 8 now, 10+ NToV, too many Yelinak/Tormax/CT etc... there have been 0 loot issues. We don't have people who'd equip twinks before primaries, though there are quite clear rules about handling twink loot.<P>Also while loot goes via the point system, me and the other officers have a veto in the whole thing. IE sometimes I get tells for who want something and I see something that's against 'the vision' and just inform them that I don't think they're actually interested in the given item  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  This is very rare again, and usually a mishap (like clerics giving tells for primal 1hb since they didn't realize a newer monk in the guild had just gotten ST key and was there with us).<P>I won't really bother explaining the whole thing, but you can check it out <A HREF="http://frobo.dyndns.org/projekt/newdkp" TARGET=_blank>here</A>.<P>The problem I see is minor inflation. IE those who just raid fairly much end up gaining a lead even though they're superbly equipped and the lead just gets bigger over time. While it's all very deserved, sometimes it does get a bit too big.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

It's run by other people and as such, everything they award will be subject to inspection, speculation and rejection. They either penalize their friends for just being their friends ("I can't award you item X because people will think it's favoritism") or they take people quietly saying "Gee, he gave his friends all that good stuff and we got nothing" which is seldom true. If people really were being shorted on loot they'd have left a long time ago.<P>Point system isn't arbitrary, it's gambling with the odds stacked in favor of those with the most time put in. It's far more reckless, IMO, because you take any real control over loot out of your hands and put it in the hands of a crapshoot. <P>Example... let's say Dikmer has 98 points and Joenoob has 2 raid points and an plate  BP drops in ToV. Dikmer gets 0-98 and Joenoob gets 99 and 100. Raid leader randoms and rolls a 99. Joenoob on his second raid has just gotten an item that Dikmer has put in hundreds of hours trying to get. Now, you explain to Dikmer why he didn't get the BP. Not too eager to talk to him, are you? Not to mention that Joenoob who's been in the guild for 2 weeks is now in a prime position to leave and go somewhere else, having gotten what he wanted.<P>You can't stop people from leaving the guild. Everyone in this game wears a facade. Some people wear them exceptionally well, others don't wear them at all. While few people will guild an obvious loot whore how do you tell the well hidden ones from the good players? You can't unless you guild only people you know RL.<P>Arbitrary loot is far better. It doesn't ignore factors like non-raid guild work (spell and gem management, raid organization, recruitment work, etc), time put in, overall use (can you really tell me a cleric needs a ToV BP over a warrior?), and need (let's say Joenoob had a Trak BP and Dikmer didn't).<P>Are there going to be arguments? Of course. Arbitrary loot is easiest at the ends of the loot cycle and is very hard in the middle. Let me give you an imaginary example...<P>Guild is farming ToV. They kill dozens of mobs for a handful of drops. Plate has been unbelieveably rare. A plate BP drops. First one. Goes to a warrior, no questions asked. Next few go to well deserving warriors who have put in tons of time without any BP upgrades (warrior BPs are really rare for some reason). The awarding of these BPs also enriches the guild as these warriors can now tank better. Then one day another plate BP drops. All the warriors have BPs now. Nobody else has a real <B>need</B> for a BP. Here's where the award system has trouble... the BP must be awarded on merit alone. There are 2 obvious choices here: a pally and a SK. Both have done great work for the guild.<P>BP is awarded to the SK, a friend of the loot caller. Pally and his friends get upset and leave, splitting the guild.<P>This is a bit extreme but I have seen things like this before. As I said, there's no way to know who will snap over a loot call and leave. But it does well as long as you recognize that loot awarded belongs to the recliever, not the guild. It's also important people look at the big picture and realize that giving equipment to those who have a real need or use can make you, as a player, better.<P>Why do all the systems break down? EQ is about levels and loot. That's it. Once you hit 60 you're out of levels and all that is left is loot. When you go for a long time without any new toys it hurts. The game is diminished to some extent. I know many casters who have complained about the lack of caster loot, for instance.<P>The key to keeping your system working is to set goals and remind people they WILL eventually get what it is they seek. It's always just a matter of time...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think a good argument over a point system is that you can reward people indirectly by giving them points.  For instance, I really don't want to do the VP key quest, but I might be tempted to do it if I were rewarded in some way for it.<P>The other point system argument is that it quantifies who is helping the guild.  Rather than it being simply a perception of one or two people that Barbarian Bob helps the guild more than Evelen Elf.  <P>Also, points could be used to bid on items rather than modify a random roll.  Silent bids could be used.  If someone really, really wanted something so badly they were willing to put up 12 points for it versus someone only wanting it for 4 points... it'd go to the person who wanted it the most.<P>And I really liked the idea of trading in items.  If you upgrade, you can trade it back in and get back 75% of the points that item is valued at.  Thus giving the guild an opportunity to pass something down or sell to cover raid costs.<P>Cool ideas coming out here.  <P>What do guilds operating with point systems do when you have non-guild people along on raids?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well, I am sure there have been disappointed people now and again in my guild, but there has not been any arguing or fighting over loot yet. We go into a "raid" with the understanding that anything gotten there will stay in the guild (if dropable), so anything we get will help us all out in some small way.<P>Of course, this doesn't apply when we are on our own EXP grinding or some such. When I did the King in Sebilis, and won a Fungi Tunic via /random, no one expected me to just give it to someone in our guild. Had it been an all guild group doing King however, any tunics that dropped would have gone to someone in the guild whether they were there or not.<P>Now, my guild isn't big enough to do ToV (we don't think at least), or many other big encounters, nor are the MOB's we CAN do ever up, so most of our raids are limited to Hate, Fear, Chardock, Velk's Lab and Trakanons Teeth. <P>On Xegony, Trankanon, Venril Sathir, Yelniak, King Tormax, the Dain and other good MOB's have a life expectancy of about 30 minutes. For my guild to get one of those guys would require us to be doing what many people do for Ragefire. Set up 2 or 3 days in advance and wait for respawn.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Dikmer has 98 points and Joenoob has 2 points means Dikmer gets everything until they are within 5 points. This means 9 first plate BPs go to Dikmer before Joenoob has even a shot at it. Or for example Vulak robe, Vulak ring, Dain head, Tormax head and THEN Joenoob might get something that Dikmer wants. Though unless Joenoob plays an awful lot Dikmer would probably have gained a bigger lead by now.<P>How do we handle invites? You people that checked our point system I had a link to saw like 80+ players there. There's like 25 invites/apps there. They get treated just like members when it comes to loot calls.<P>All in all the system has worked perfectly for us. Those with HUGE attendance go for totally perfect sets, hence leaving lots of stuff for the not-so-active people. For example SK/Paladin/Bard usually prefer Statue BP to the class BP. Hence we have a insanely active SK not going in on plate bp and letting an invite loot one because, well... getting plate bp and THEN getting statue BP would be a total waste of 10 points (not to mention it'd be a waste to have 2 high quality bps on one person from the guilds point of view).<P>Loot 'tiers' form at times though, depending on how much you play, but generally the price in points goes up faster than the added stats (status value). For example Vulak Robe is 25 points, while in reality it isn't THAT much better than templars bp for 10 points. Still, next one we'll get will be going to a cleric who plays a lot who'd like it.<P>It's per player. We have lots of people who play 2 chars at raids every now and then. The advantage they get from this the fact that these other chars get the 'twink loot' easy (stuff that nobody wants for 25%).<P>Heh giving stuff to warriors first is quite amusing. The 4th most capable guild on the server kept doing it except their warriors seemed to enjoy applying to us once they had full warlords etc. What can I say. Equip the core people no matter what class they are. Those are the people that make the guild and I don't give a damn who tanks. Those that are loyal and help as often as possible (earning dkp in the side). There were cases of a warriors getting all sorts of stuff in the 4th guild and being in there for like 3 weeks before applying to join us... Reliability > class.<P>Hmm I need to talk with the guildmate that created the system about possibly sharing it.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife<p>[This message has been edited by Delheru (edited 10-05-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>My guild has raid loot by committee burned into our charter. (all loot is decided by GL and officers as they drop)<P>Everyone who joins the guild is made well aware of how we handle loot, and any kind of arguing or second-guessing the officers over loot is highly discouraged. They have always been fair and non-elitist with deciding loot, handling it in a way that the item goes to where it would benifit the guild the best.<P>When you institute some kind of point system or some other complex arbitrary or random system you are basically saying "we dont trust our leaders at all to be rational thinking people able to decide loot. They are so immoral and prone to favoritism, that we are better off trusting the dice, or points than in our leaders." If these suspicions ever proved to be true, that guild was going to be doomed anyway.<P>We trust our officers with the unwanted heavy responsibility of awarding loot (sometimes their decisions take right near corpse-decay), and that trust hasnt been betrayed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I like modified DKP. You can't go in on a roll unless you have at least 75% of the points of the top person in the roll (eliminates extreme luck), and you can't spend points on anything you want, some things are closed to all but a few classes unless none of the members of those classes present want or can afford (stuff like wurm/wyvern legs goes to monks first, haste items go to melees before casters, ect).<P>Merit is okay for smaller guilds, but as you grow, it always turns into a huge headache. <P>Aiien </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Caelyu...<P>I'm the one doing most of the loot calls for my guild, and I really have to say I love the dkp. Not because I think I'm unable to be unbiased, but rather because we can get so much loot in one day it's really quite ridiculous for me to waste time on it.<P>Lets look at last patch. I think we killed 11 NToV dragons, with like 10 armor drops and 5 guards dropping items. Dragons averaged 2.5 items or so. That's about 40-45 items. Good thing we wanted to dwell 30min at each corpse.<P>Now<BR>1. Total avoidance of discord about the issue<BR>2. I don't have to bother thinking about who got what before, it's all there in the dkp on another comp. Even the best raidleader would forget what stuff people have got compared to their raidcount... just look at how much **** people have gotten in our dkp. Items worth up to 17 plate BPs. Huge headache and would probably take that 30min at every mob.<BR>3. Saves that 30min after every big loot drop. That's minimum 5 HOURS of deciding loot on that raid of ours. Oh yay I _really_ want to waste time like that.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>DKP stands for Dragon Kill Points.<P>Long ago on Mith Marr, a group of 3-4 guilds would regularly kill Vox/Nagafen.  We had huge fights over loot and tried many different ways to distribute loot.  <P>Our biggest problems where:<BR>-First raid ever attendie winning loot.<BR>-Veterans with 12+ dragons under their belt and no loot to show for it.<BR>-Comunication problems, people we didn't like showing up, long setup times, etc<BR>-Lucky People wining 2-3 items before long time Veterans got 1.<BR>-Loot voting system giving to favored people, bribing for votes.<BR>-Casters only showing up at Vox<BR>-Melee only showing up at Nagafen<BR>-Clerics all in hate<BR>-Monks all in fear<P>Some of the principle leaders of these raids got togeather and planned to create a new guild by merging the raiders from the 3-4 guilds to facilitate the communicaton problem.  We adopted a points based system to assure people who attended enough raids would eventually get something, and to give classes who's loot doesn't drop a reward for attending the raid.<P>The guild was Afterlife, the points system we called DKP or dragon kill points.  Over the last few years we have had to refine the system to solve a few problems.  The biggest change we added was IDKP, or Incentive DKP, to reward people for attending our failed attempts.  Such as our 2 nights of hell figuring out how to kill Vyemm or the 4th warder.  We also have a mains before twinks rule.   A main with -20 dkp can win an item over a twink with 90 dkp.<P>Basically in the DKP system you:<BR>Earn points for attending raids.<BR>Spend points buying items.<BR>When an item drops, the person in charge of lottos asks who wants the items, then looks at the DKP list. The item goes to the person with the highest dkp unless someone else in the lotto is within 5 points.  So if I go in for a 20 point item and I have 100 points, and someone else has 95 points, we lotto it. 1-100 goes to me, 101-195 goes to him.  We roll /random 1 195.<P>DKP has its ups and downs, but overall I'm very happy with it, and would not want any other system.  That said its not for everyone.<P>Pros:<BR>-Very impartial, no favoritism or bias.<BR>-Low class bias, even bards can get top notch equipment.  However, in some cases we do add a bias, Guantlets of Dragon Slaying for instance casters have a -20 dkp penalty.  First bracer gives you a 20 dkp bonus, etc.<P>Cons:<BR>-Lots of work recording who, what, when<BR>-Casual players tend to feel left out<BR>-Lesser items or items with too high point costs can rot.<P>Smegal BoneMender - High Priest, guild Afterlife.<BR>You can view my dkp at: <A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/dkp.cgi?history=Smegal" TARGET=_blank>http://www.afterlifeguild.org/dkp.cgi?history=Smegal</A> <BR>You can view my profile at: <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3761" TARGET=_blank>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3761</A> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Most the stuff that rots are class specific items after all of that class have.  Point costs should reflect the quality of the item, how big of an upgrade it is, and the demand for it.   Gauntlets of Dragon Slaying are some of the best gloves in the game, usuable by all, and therefore cost 20 dkp.  Shield of the Dragon Kinda is marginal upgrade over Orb of the infinate void, and Yatikima's Shield is better, so it is only 4 dkp.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>One question to also ask when looting at a loot system is Time zones of your players. This was a big problem with a point system that I saw in action and basically made it Impossible for those on other time zones to get any benifit from anything they may put in. Most weekday raids are held in the evening Eastern time. If a Raid starts at 7 or 8 PM Eastern this equates to 1 or 2 AM in europe. Now tack on 6 Hrs raid time and You get the picture. If you are able to hold raids on their times then this will not be an issue but the leadership that was in place did not want to be "burdened" with keeping track of the extra points. Anyways point systems can be effective but there are extenuating circumstances that have to be factored in also when deciding a loot policy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>D-uhh.<P>Make one of the more active europeans an officer then. Or if they just don't raid at ALL, then you aren't exactly a raiding guild and this isn't an issue.<P>As for the stuff rotting. Yeah that happens with dkp, but you can usually adjust the point system easily if you have a) studied economics b) got brains. It really is amazingly complex, but it gets bit too complex if you allow bidding. Prices aren't really decided by the quality of the product, but just like in RL: supply and demand. If item X is a small improvement, but for every damn class there is (and there's no obvious better alternative) it's price will be pretty high compared to cost, whereas a better item with lots of 'competition' will have a lower price. As an example here mithril boots are more expensive dkp wise than boots of the storm for us. Why? Because the chain wearers are interested as well.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok, next question is...<P>How do you keep track of all this?  One amazing spreadsheet?    I saw Ascent's system.  Looks very, very nice.  <P>Having some web based point maintenance tool would be fantastic.<P>How did you come up with initial point values for loot?  And how do you make a determination for new loot that isn't already in your database?  <P>Personally, I'm not terribly clued into loot, who drops what, what is considered good or crud for various classes.  Maybe just knowing whether something is a common drop, uncommon, rare or ultra-rare would be enough.<P>I'd imagine at first implementing this everyone is going to have roughly the same point scores for a few weeks.  <P>Another question for raid points.  We have at times rather long raids that can run for 10+ hours, sometimes ones that span days -- like Air.  Since our guild is composed of people with real lives, families and jobs it isn't atypical to have people that can only stay for a few hours.  We want them to come so awarding them points is a must.  Still, for the people that are there from start to finish should get awarded more, IMO.   How do you work that?  Give points by the number of hours they attend?  I was thinking that a /who GUILD once every couple of hours might do the trick.  Just seems like even more work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> <A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org" TARGET=_blank>www.afterlifeguild.org</A> <P>We use a database/web engine to handle the tracking of points.   <P>As for values.  It originally started with an average of 24 people attending a raid (24 points coming into the system) and 2-3 items being bought.   So most the items cost 10-12 points. <P>Honestly though, if you coming up with the point values for mobs/loot is pretty easy compared to keeping track of 50+ people, 19 dead dkp mobs, and 70+ dkp loots in one day.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wow, thanks very much for the links! <P>I still have questions, though. I would basically be building a DKP system from scratch. How did you go about deciding how much mobs are worth, or how much items cost? What kind of things should I consider when trying to figure that out?<P>I think my guild would use a DKP, if I could get it set up so that it was easy to use. We currently use a loot list, which is basically the same idea, but very, very crude in comparison (basically, the person highest on the list is equivalent to the person with the most dkp, and each item costs your entire dkp, since you move to the back of the list). Like I said, crude, but much more fair than simple randoming, and relatively easy to administer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The guild I am in also use's a point system for very much the same reason that many have posted above, old world randoms where not very fair.  One thing we do differently than many of the other point systems is that we do no set values for items.  We allow all mains who can use an item and are present for the kill to auction for an item witht he points they have accomulated.  This will set the base value and each auction there after for the same item will start at half the cost of what the item went for previously.  This allows the players to determine the value of items.  We have found it to work pretty well.  The only issue's we have are setting the values of mobs, which is no real big deal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007249&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007249&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
