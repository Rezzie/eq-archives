Just got done with a failed Trak raid... and if we'd just had a chance to attack the damn thing on level ground we would have destroyed it. First time around it trak touched our DAed paladin then chased him, running right into our party on the bridge... we fought him there, got him to 60% life easy, then he got knocked into the water and screwed us up good. Second time, after like an hour getting the protector away from him, we're all set up on the bridge and next thing we know boom! mass blindness... we were still prepping for the charge and not ready to fight him, plus if we did fight he'd go right to the bridge again.<br />
<br />
The frustrating thing is it doesn't even seem to matter whether we had the power to kill him or not, it's just getting to that point that takes forever. Is there a way to do Trak smoothly, without him coming out of his lair at the most inopportune moment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">07-15-2001, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You need to wait till he is in the back of his lair.  I just got done pulling for my guilds Trak raid this weekend (gasp! a cleric pulling a trak raid!).  It can easily go your way if you just give him a few min to go into the back of his lair when it comes charge time.  I never had a bad experience while hes in that position.  One time we waited too long and he moved and when he did, he came right out and ate us.  That was long ago before we knew his timer on how long he sits in a spot.<br />

<br />
So if I understand you right it's do the little wait-on-the-protector dance and once he's gone just charge once Trak hits the back of the lair? What do you do about Tolapumj - pull him before or after you kill Trak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">07-15-2001, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leave Jumpy there.  You can easily avoid him by hugging the left as you charge.  If your just waiting around on Trak to spawn, of course just pull him.<br />

<br />
Back when Trakanon was a major event for us we always attacked with Tola and the juggernauts still in place, just stick right as you enter the lair.<br />
<br />
Lately we have been going with four groups and hitting the lair at full spawn, just have a warrior tank the Protector while Trakanon dies.<br />
<br />
Getting Trakanon into position is pretty much a matter of going where you want in the lair and letting him come to you, do not engage him until you have him in the spot you wish to fight.<br />

Never really had a problem positioning him, just send in 2 pallies or 2 necros with DA and run them to the back of the lair when he's in the back.  Need a monk spotter, etc.<br />
