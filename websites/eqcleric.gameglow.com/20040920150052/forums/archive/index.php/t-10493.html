<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roechek</div><div class="date">01-12-2000, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With one or two more ghouls in Unrest, I'll hit 23 tonight. As I've been in Unrest since 20, I think I'd like a change of scenery. <br />
<br />
I'm also discovering that much of the stuff inside the house is now either green, or in pairs. Further, the blue stuff that actually gives decent experience in Unrest is way too tough to bring down with Expulse. <br />
<br />
So as soon as I hit 23, I am going to go buy my 24th level spells, and head someplace else until 24. I'm looking for suggestions on someplace with a good exp/hour ratio. I'll group or solo. It matters not to me.<br />
<br />
I've noticed people talking about the hermit in SK. I may try that. Can a single 23 with decent AC handle him? I certainly like the idea of a 3-minute spawn. Does anyone have a loc, or he easy to find from the aviak tree?<br />
