<br />
Rather than get in a group right off the bat, I have soloed some to the right of the lake coming in from FV.  This is a good area to Melee 16 away as most MOBs seem to be light blue but it isn't hard to find blues with the occasional even.  I would find a blue, Nuke it to pull and then melee it to death.  Because of the large number of non-aggro blues, I haven't had a problem with adds.  I have found that my dodge and Defense are coming up nicely which I hope will help me out when I move to the Sarnak fort soon.  <br />
<br />
I have leveled a Monk and a Druid here previously and contrary to what many people say, I love this zone.  So much better than Oasis where EXP rocked untill the Specs or a SG reversed the EXP bar (and once the stupid specs get out, they usually keep anyone from getting exp for a long time as everyone keeps training them back to zones during Corpse runs).</div></div><hr />
