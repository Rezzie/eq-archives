I havent been to POH since the patch when non-KOS people became KOS. I hear everyone trying to do POH get trained when they zone in on our server. Also hear talk about invissing to South west corner? While they say that on other servers they start fighting from zone-in point... Would like to hear how its being done now. Any input welcome!  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I suppose you could ask a GM to kill everything for you.<br />

The easiest way to do hate now is to zone in with all groups and pull into the south west corner.  Make sure of course you have a couple monks/necros/sks in the first group that can go up and feign.  First off you should have everyone invis as this somewhat reduces the aggro radius and decreases the likelihood that you will get swarmed while in the first house.  Then it's a matter of exiting main building - turning right - go to wall - turn right - go to corner - turn right, climb wall,  run like hell to the other corner.  Rule number 1. EXPECT TO DIE the first time.  The hardest part of this method is getting a cleric to the other corner and logged out in one piece.  Best way to do this is feign pullers distract the mobs along the back wall long enough for three or four clerics to run past and then camp in the other corner.  Once you have one cleric safely logged in the corner then its a matter of everyone getting in, probably dying, and getting their corpse dragged to the south west corner and getting ressed.  Advantages to this location over the initial pull room is that there are no wanderers that just walk in for kicks.  Trains can still get out of hand but thats largely dependent on the pullers skill level and familiarity with the zone.  I know this spot is safe as I logged in three days after hate had last been in - all spawns were in zone and I was logged in the south west corner up on the wall without invis or invis undead up.  Sat there for 5 minutes and saw nothing. (then got the wigglies and gated to be safe).&lt;/p&gt;<br />
It is of course common knowledge now that the drops in hate were so heinously nerfed that you have to have the patience of Job or the luck of midas to walk out with anything you want(this was noted by abashi and acknowledged as needing reworking).&lt;/P&gt;  Anyway I hope this is of help to you all and may your lives as clerics always be filled with intensity.<br />

Still I remember from looking at how the zone was made, pathing-wise etc. it kinda felt as if it was designed for being pulled from the zone in spot. I'm curious if anyone have actually been able to pull to this spot without getting the lovely train, hehe.<br />

Sure, run like hell to the wall, but let someone else lead.  There are only a few things that see through invis (and ony scorn bashees see through rogue sneak).<br />
<br />
Once you hit the wall and turn right, just make sure you're up about 1/2 way or more to the top of the wall.  After you start going to the SWC, con everything you see.  If it cons indifferent, just walk right by it.  If it scowls, wait until it goes away or engagues someone else before walking by it.<br />
<br />
If you get attacked, just die.  You Never EVER train the SWC.  Only a few poeple should have to die to get everyone there, but if are going to die, GET OFF THE WALL.  It makes finding your body a lot easier.</div></div><hr />
