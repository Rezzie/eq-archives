<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zevrin</div><div class="date">02-04-2000, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i'm pretty tired of seeing all these other spellcasting classes getting updates and changes to their spells and abilities while we sit aside like patient little boys and girls.  We have a few things that could be changed as well, right?  <br />
For instance:<br />
<br />
Our strength line could be replaced with something useful.<br />
<br />
Our heal spells could use a reduced casting time.  And maybe a reduced mana cost (maybe).<br />
<br />
And what's this BS about us having to choose between a healing cleric and a battle cleric.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't a battle cleric a Paladin.  For the most part.  What is that all about.  Does a druid have to choose between being a druid or a Ranger.  I don't think so.<br />
<br />
As it is, there are only a couple things we can do effectively.  That is Heal and Buff.  We aren't very good in Melee, and our DD spells don't compare to other classes.  Granted it is somewhat gratifying to be the healer and keep everyone alive, but come on, at least make us a little better at it then.  Perhaps give us some addtional buffs.<br />
<br />
If you disagree with me, tell me why.  If you agree, tell me that too, and add to this if you have any other, serious ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're the best healers.<br />
We have good buffs.<br />
We have great stuns.<br />
<br />
The Strength line is useful in some cases.<br />
So is the hammer line.<br />
<br />
You just have to need to use them.<br />
<br />
In my case, I don't have a magical weapon at level 26.  Therefore, summoned hammers come in quite handy sometimes.<br />

Yaulp II + Reckless Strength = +35 ATK.<br />

To each his own.<br />
