<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenae</div><div class="date">12-06-2000, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Think about it this way:<br />
<br />
How often would you ACTUALLY cast it?  I often lusted after invisibility myself, but after I got a Lasnik's Mask (casts superior camo) I'm STILL not using the thing.<br />
<br />
Lets be realistic here.  The ONLY time I would need to cast Invis is if I was:<br />
<br />
A.  Travelling alone in a place where the mobs acutally didn't see invis.<br />
B.  No other time that i can really think of.<br />
<br />
Now lets revisit the alternatives.  If something attacks you outside, ROOT it.  Cast FEAR.  Do something to make it go away.  Then run off with jboots or SoW or a SoW potion (stackable woohoo!) or something.  I mean come on people - so we can't cast invis.  They can't cast HEALS either (mostly), or single target stun for beans, or become invulnerable for 30 secs, or many other things.<br />
<br />
The only time I have actually popped my mask is when I was going Prod hunting with a friend.  She was an SK, so I invis'd myself and we walked in.  We could have just beat our way in (55 and 45 respectively), but invis was quicker so I used it.  <br />
<br />
Let it go, being pissed about invis is ridiculous.  <br />

Although I don't think he was &quot;pissed&quot; as one poster believed, I think he hit on the topic of class specific skills which we Clerics have very few of.  Invis to undead was always a LCeric/Pally thing and granted, either version of Invis is not that unbalancing, but more to the point, I think it infringes more into the &quot;clerics&quot; territory of class specicific skills and spells than to do any harm  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  hust my 2 cents, keep the change.</div></div><hr />

I play a necro also, and one thing I truely miss when playing my cleric is the invisible spell.<br />
<br />
Its not ridiculous to be pissed about this.  If other classes get all our spells, then I think its only fair we get theirs.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things Verant does that are completly unfair and stupid.  <br />
<br />
Why do druids get every type of spell in the game?  And I'm not talking weak spells, they get the top of the line... except rez spells.  I never did understand why a druid (supposedly one with the animals) has the ability to teleport himself and others to another land.  Obviously one of the top Verant employees plays a druid.<br />
<br />
No I'm not saying druids should be nerfed now, I'm a firm believer in no-nerfs.  But am sick of the Verant logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFLMAO!  Now that's funny!<br />
<br />
Besides the resurrection line, Druids do not get top of the line Healing or Pet spells.  Most of the druid DDs are fire-based, which limits their versatility in certain areas.  I don't know for sure about the DoTs, but I think both Shaman and Necromancer lines are better.  Also, Shaman and Cleric buffs are both better IMO than Druids'.<br />
<br />
As far as teleports go, I suspect that has to do with ley lines.  I believe that some old Arthurian stories list Merlin (a druid) as moving entire armies quickly.<br />
<br />
Besides, if a top Verant employee played a druid, why would they look like newbies for so much of their careers?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example you say cleric buffs are better than druids????  Then please explain to me, while I'm at level 44, and Druid buffs STILL override cleric buffs (people of the same level).<br />
<br />
And Druids do too get every single spell in this game, except, rez, clarity and obviously pet spells, but I didn't mention that because its pretty obvious... although they can turn themself and others into wolves, so in reality it somewhat the same.<br />
<br />
I've also seen many druids solo red's, where me a a cleric am lucky to solo a blue.  So please spare me about druids having weak spells.  They do not.  They have snare, sow, and good DOT's, and every other spell in the game.<br />
<br />
And if someone calls my post a flame, well its not any more a flame than Kimbera's is with the ROFLMAO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which buffs are you referring to?  IIRC, a higher level spell will overwrite a lower level.  I think the caster level comes into play if the spells are the same level.<br />
<br />
If both are equal, I'm not sure whether the hit point or AC side of the spell is what determines what overwrites.  In either case, I still maintain that the cleric buffs are better, given the mana costs.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Druids do too get every single spell in this game, except, rez, clarity and obviously pet spells, but I didn't mention that because its pretty obvious... although they can turn themself and others into wolves, so in reality it somewhat the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your previous point specified &quot;top of the line&quot;.  THAT is what I dispute.  Are you claiming that druids DO, in fact, get Complete Heal, Ice Comet, etc.?  That's what triggered my response - that and the class envy/bashing.</div></div><hr />

Aaargh it drives me nuts.. typically nowadays I spend 300pp to buy as many as I can hold after getting a guildmate to port me somewhere I can buy them (i.e., Dreadlands).<br />
<br />
I don't always need invis, but to get to Kael, I do sometimes.<br />
<br />
And yes, I think it's stupid that wizards get invis to undead.  Enchanters I sort of understand, but not wizards.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fergus</div><div class="date">10-18-2001, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a couple of notes...<br />
<br />
Clerics have a line of AC buffs, and a line of AC/HP buffs, plus symbol. the druids have their &quot;skin&quot; line (plus a self-only line)... there are times during the progression through levels that the druid's buffs will overwrite one of the cleric's buffs, usually at a point when druid has just earned and upgrade -- at this point the spells are pretty close to being equal (of course, the cleric can stack his/her other line on and thus end up with a much superior total enhancement. (I have a 49 cleric and a 47 druid).<br />
<br />
I think the reason for both the spells given to the druid and the spells withheld from the cleric are primarily the desire of Verant to build interdependence.  If the druid truly got the best of all spells, wouldn't you think they would be very sought after in the high end game? in fact, they tend to have some trouble getting into guilds/groups/etc at the higher levels if they haven't built up a strong reputation/circle of friends...because they have the tools to do a lot of jobs pretty well, but there is usually someone who has the tools to do it better or more efficiently, and the difference becomes more and more important in the higher levels.<br />
<br />
My cleric was my first character, and as someone who had very erratic playing times, I would make friends but was not able to plan on regular groups or arrange to meet people (I was not in a guild at the time), so I often found myself venturing out to explore on my own ... and grew quite frustrated at my lack of &quot;travelling&quot; tools:<br />
<br />
no ports, no speed enhancements, no invisibility, no levitate...not a strong enough tanking ability to rely on that... <br />
<br />
(I'm not griping about this at all, I'm just saying that it was such a blanket shortfall that I stopped thinking it was coincidence). I think that a decision was specifically made that clerics would not be very &quot;mobile&quot;.  Verant has made no bones about the fact that they WANT classes to need each other, so they take a class that is highly needed, and in some cases desperately needed in a specific spot without much notice, and they make that class mobility-impaired.... certainly that has got to create some interdependence.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that druid doesn't get the low-aggro heal spells (although they do get the regen/chloro line); the druid has great mobility, but can't punt the player who needs to leave your group, or call in his replacement. he can heal, but he can't wear the armor to take the abuse when he gets aggro for that heal. (and doesn't get the lower-aggro heal spells, tho does get regen/chloro)<br />
<br />
they can't nuke as well as a wizard or dot as well as a necro... not that they should. Just realize that when a specific job is called for, the class people are going to be looking for is usually some class other than a druid.<br />
<br />
I enjoy playing both classes, as well as my current &quot;main&quot; (54 enchanter). druids can be a lot of fun to play, and really hit their strides about level 14... when I hit that level on my first druid I felt godlike.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif And if I'm bored and just want to wander on my own and explore a bit, nothing beats my druid. I don't enjoy soloing for experience much (i get bored way too easily), though, and the supply/demand ratio for higher level druids in groups is not in your favor...<br />
<br />
fun to play? sure<br />
lot of nice spells? sure<br />
overpowered? ...I don't really think so, at least not if you want to do anything but grind out solo experience, and I don't really see that as a huge advantage.<br />

<br />
I also carry a Larikan mask (doesn't every cleric?) and I have often found reasons to use it.  It seems clerics are the only people who bother binding near where they fight anymore, so I'm often pulling bodies.  <br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to cast invis before I camped out in Hate.<br />
<br />
With the exception of wizards every other spell casting class only gets IVU or Invis, not both.  I'm not sure why wizards are deserving of both.  Do I think giving Wizards IVU is unbalancing?  No, not really.  I would just like to have better options for self-invis for a cleric.  <br />

Well re the mask yes when ever i have on i carry it however i tend to use them up in aboout 1 ro 3 days on average.  <br />
I go throughlots of invis potions, my gripe with velius sellign invis potions is nither of the 'high end factions' ie dragosn or giants sell them, as my guidl kills the dian regularly.  also if your dragon and snorf allied adn Are in ss it's hard to get to thrug to buy more.<br />
<br />
and um enchaters the masters of ilution the clas of spell invis is have always had both, nercos have both itu and invis though there invis is self only, not sure of SK's get either or both or none of those spelsl from there parrent class teh necro.<br />

<br />
The cast time on mask make recasting if lost in bad area impossible.  I still prefer the potions.  Running through WW to ToV, i run it without invis if I have too.  Hounds have killed me though, they suck.  Aggro from down in DN gorge, grrr.  <br />
<br />
Obviously not everyone uses invis.  I survived 54 levels before ever using my first potions.  Now I use them constantly.  Needs will change, and you will covet the ability to Invis.  <br />
<br />
Wiz have invis and ITU, Ench, SK, Necros.  Wars/sk get an inviso BP from chardok.  Even a perm effect inviso item would be good.   I been ranting about this since velious came out  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callador</div><div class="date">11-01-2001, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With Velious there are some special cases I'd like to point out. These cases also exist pre Velious only less numoerous.<br />
<br />
You're in zoone X when someone in zone Y asks for a res and you're out of invisibility potions. The person asking for a res needs the cleric - class dependance. Very often this will involve travelling through a zone in which you are KoS. Clerics not having the invisibility spell in their book need, as the situation is now, the services of class that can cast invisibility on others. Is it right that one class should be dependant on another class to aid a 3rd ? I would have to say no. This is a scenario I have experienced so many times, that I have started turning res requests down if I know I have to travel through hostile zones.<br />
<br />
My point here is, that clerics need regular invisibility because it is in the interest of all other classes.<br />
<br />
Never heard of Larrikans mask till I read this thread. This could of course be because I never spent much time in Seb. Also I refuse to return to a few select spots to purchase items such as invisibiliy potions - didn't even know they existed till my cleric was level 58.<br />

Personally I think it would be a great idea for clerics to get an invis spell, even if it's self only. That'd still be cool with me. One other person always stated that they are always dragging corpses for rezing. In those cases invis would be very useful if the particular mobs in that area can't see through invis. What would also be nice is maybe a few self only port. I think that would be great considering all the dangerous or even stupid places some people die. We are expected to rull all over hell and back to rez those people we could use some good spells to help us get to their corpses in a safe and timely manner. I know we'll never see the port spells, that much is obvious, but I would LOVE to see a regular invis spell even if it's self only. I know an invis spell is not too much to ask. And not all of us can get that mask you speak so highly of. Not all of us are quite ready to take on a lvl 53 anything.... and how do you get to OS? I've heard of it but I'm still somewhat new to the game (playing for about 6 months) so I am still learning.<br />
It was also mentioned that we can just root and fear and run away. What if root and fear are resisted? Can you say &quot;Bye bye cleric?&quot; Yeah I thought you could. Any way after too much rambling my point is that clerics are in desperate need of an invis spell and I think we are well over due to get one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general I run nearly everywhere w/o invis, DA and DB are pretty good for getting past big things and I have pretty high ac/hp so I can take a few hits.  But there are certainly times where it's gotten me killed (that lovely white dragon in WL procced 1250 dmg on me twice in a row then whacked me for 750 to finish me off while I was running through WL unbuffed one night)<br />
<br />
As a raiding cleric in the high end game I normally have to run through WW at *least* once a night, sometimes naked (grats bugged corpse).  The invis spell would be wonderful for this.<br />
<br />
At the very least if they dont want to give us invis they need to make the potions stackable or charged , and they need to be available in EVERY city.  As it stands now being on giant faction I can't buy invis pots at all in velious.<br />

Why do druids get every type of spell in the game?  And I'm not talking weak spells, they get the top of the line... except rez spells.  I never did understand why a druid (supposedly one with the animals) has the ability to teleport himself and others to another land.  Obviously one of the top Verant employees plays a druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually I was told that way back before EQ was even close to being ready for beta testing that Druids were the first and for a long time the only class that existed.  They were used as a utility character that VI developers could test out the developing code.  Later it was decided via &quot;The Vision&quot; that there was room for a strong utility class in the game and viola! The dev team utility class tool became druids, so yes one of the top Verant Employees plays a druid - in fact they all did before they played any other class.<br />
<br />
Of course this could all be rumor, but I tend to believe it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chukoliang</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now lets revisit the alternatives.  If something attacks you outside, ROOT it.  Cast FEAR.  Do something to make it go away.  Then run off with jboots or SoW or a SoW potion (stackable woohoo!) or something.  I mean come on people - so we can't cast invis.  They can't cast HEALS either (mostly), or single target stun for beans, or become invulnerable for 30 secs, or many other things.<br />
<br />
Umm, maybe you can cast fear, but my cleric fear spell takes a long time to go off. I have a very hard time getting fear/root/etc to go off when something is kicking my head in. I don't have a rune series of spells that makes me immune for a couple of seconds, to cast anytime I want. My Barrier spell takes a long time to go off and I can't out run the mobs that are chasing me, even if it does. I don't have awesome spells that will drop the mob in a couple of seconds. I'm a dwarf so my atone type spells don't work ,unless i'm trying to waste mana to pull things, because I have no charm.<br />
<br />
I think clerics need to be addressed by EQ. I am level 52. I can not solo level 40 mobs in the Dreadlands. I hit with my weapon for 20 points of damage, and that is when I actually manage to hit. My spells are very slow and they don't do much damage compared to other casters. The mob quads for 100 points of damage, it hits extremely fast. Even the NPC casters hit harder and faster then I can.<br />
<br />
I am not saying as a cleric I should be able to nuke down things my level super easy like other classes. But you have to admit that something is wrong when a lvl 52 cleric can not cross from say the north side of K.C. to  the BW or Fv zone without a very real chance that these very green mobs could kill him, and it's not even a close match. My cleric is 12 levels higher and can not get by these mobs without using sow, or invis potions or spells from other players. It sounds easy but with my charm it costs me 13+ plat for an invis potion and 10 plat is the average cost of a sow potion. Thats 23 plat to cross a zone with mobs that are massively green to you.<br />
<br />
Obviously a quick fix for this would be an invis spell. Everyone else has it, and they are getting the invis vs undead spells which seem illogical. As pointed out by the post I quoted , the invis would be useless in zones where mobs can see through invis ( which just seems to be extremely lazy programming by Sony), but such an invis should work on any mob that is green to you. This would allow clerics who are not twinked and who are not stat twinked like a high elf the ability to cross a green zone safely.<br />
<br />
Obviously the Clerics ability to solo has been neglected. We can maybe only solo undead, however even this can be extremely difficult. Our spells are slow and not that damaging and can be very bad on mana efficency. And we all know how reliable root is , when attacking someone. We don't get mana  regen spells till much higher levels and everyone else has those spells at that time also. <br />
<br />
Something needs to be addressed to help clerics solo. I think EQ started addressing this with the Summoned Hammer Pet ,that was nerfed before it was released. Obviously a 100hp pet that cost 600 mana is useless at level 54. Eq should fix this pet so that it equal to a lvl 54 Enchanter pet, but have it look like a hammer. The pet would not follow attack commands and would often save the clerics life. <br />
<br />
The cleric could use it to solo ,but since his  target aggro lowering spells are not really working (unless he is a High Elf) he would still have a hard time seperating the undead that are stacked on top of each other, that are actually exp. If the spell was to summon a pet equal to an Enchanter pet of this level, This would be an unswerving Hammer of Faith. And it would make it worth the 600 mana it now costs. This is balanced out in the fact that these types of pets are not often useable in manay zones. If they can give druids who are quad kiting a pet that takes orders, then a hammer that only protects for a cleric is not unbalancing. I think most clerics would even be willing to summon one with a jasper or even buy the daggers that enchanters use (if they put them in places clerics can actually buy them). Even though we already pay to much in items for spells as it is.<br />
<br />
And lastly cleric spells being based on charm has to be addressed. Either they have to change the character settings and make charm a main attribute of all clerics and therefore make all cleric eleigible characters have a base of 100 charm. This would have to be done so that they can even have a chance to cast these charm based spells. Either that or fix these spells so they are not based on charm. <br />
<br />
If you changed the spells test to wisdom then all clerics would be able to use the , Atone/and Pacify series of spells. As it stands now none of these spells are useable by the majority of clerics except for by High Elves.<br />
<br />
In the case of Death Pact If I was gonna cast Death Pact it would only be useable on an enchanter. And then it cost 10 plat to casts and it only last 10 minutes. There is no way this spell should work on a Agnostic , high charmed enchanter better then it works on a cleric or a Paladin from the god of that cleric. This is pure silliness. They should change it to a percentage chance per level of the person casting it, who of course is from that god. <br />
<br />
This would mean that if the cleric cast it on himself , he would have something like a 35% chance of being resurrected. A Paladin from the same church would have the same chance. An agnostic person recieving the spell would have a 30% chance of being revived and person from another diety would have a 25% chance of being revived. Then lastly a person from an opposing diety would only have a 20% chance of being revived with the 400 hps. <br />
<br />
That would fix the spell so that it would be useable by clerics of the same church and if the duration was changed for something like 30 minutes instead of the 10 minutes every cleric walking the medical beat would be using that spell on everyone in their group.<br />
<br />
I think these changes would benefit every cleric in the game and would not step over any of the perceived balance lines. These changes would also help other classes benefit from the cleric's services and make a cleric even better to have in a group. <br />
<br />
This would address the clerics weaknesses now and I think all clerics should write to eq and press for these changes.<br />
<br />
Many people will reply to this and say something like the poster that I quoted at the beginning. But attitudes like that make characters that have, have everything, and those of us who don't have (and clerics are one of the leading don't have classes) have less. EQ is not about class disparity , Eq is supposed to have a balanced role for all. <br />
<br />
Stand up for the clerics brothers and those of you that benefit from our services and get those clerics something to make them more viable. Just think how much stronger your guild would be with more people playing clerics, because the class is more viable.<br />

<br />
And what do you specialize in? If it's alteration, then you should have no problem getting a root or fear off if a greenie is beating on you<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josiefuz</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of those ideas I like, especially the death pact/divine intervention one being deity based.<br />
<br />
The only disagreement I have is the cleric being helpless during travelling.  Before I had tboots (bought them at level 56) I used to routinely go from the DL spires to the Orb in Sebilis without sow or invis (used IVU when in TT though).  I was never in danger there.  Root, fear, and stun worked fine (I'm a human with 75 charisma) and I almost never die during travelling (the EW death squad being the exception).<br />
<br />
Atone only works every now and then.  I often had to cast it 3+ times to get it to work.  But with root, I can get off 3 atones at least before root breaks.<br />
<br />
For the travelling cleric, I recommend this spell setup:<br />
<br />
1.  Fear<br />
2.  Stun<br />
3.  Nuke<br />
4.  Heal over time<br />
5.  Root<br />
6.  Gate<br />
7.  Divine Barrier<br />
8.  Divine Aura<br />
<br />
Again, you have some strong points, but assuming the travelling cleric is 5+ levels over the mobs in the area, travelling should not be that dangerous.<br />

<br />
in outdoor zones u dont need invis (assuming ur over the avrg lvl of the zone) just keep root/da/atone up.</div></div><hr />
