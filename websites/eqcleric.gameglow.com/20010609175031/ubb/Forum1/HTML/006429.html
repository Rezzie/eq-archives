</FONT><HR>I've been reading alot of this ragefire schwack and while I never plan on getting my "epic" snicker, it seems that many people plan on getting it. As Cayleu stated in her (i'm asuming Cayleu is a girl, please forgive me if i'm wrong) post on the Luclin server there is a list and it's working awsome. People come out and have fun for once instead of bickering about who gets what. The reason for this thread is this, why doesn't everyone do it? I saw alot of posts saying how it was an awsome idea and how they wished their server had the same type of thing. Well you can wish in one hand and **** in the other and see which one gets filled first.<P>Why don't you all do something about it? Ok here is where all the lame excuses come in..... blah blah politics blah blah people won't do it. Well here is the thing, if you want it then DO IT. don't wait for everyone else to do it, tell your guild this is how it's gonna work, and get other clerics involved. This may mean having to wait on your epic but if you want a system like that it WILL take sacrifices and that might mean you. Why can't we get all the clerics to adhear to a system like this, screw the rest of your guild if they dont' like it, if you agree to it then that's all that matters and stick to it until your guild comes around to it's senses.<P>sorry about the rant, i just see all these people saying they want this type of system on their server but no one is willing to work at it. anything is possible if you work at it hard enough, so if you want this type of thing stop wishing and start doing it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Guild buy-in is why.  Luclins Ragefire list is not UberGuild friendly.<P>If the Uberguilds on the server are unhappy with the list, you can forget it.  They could easily decide to go FFA on him, you could then flush the list down the toilet, and it would only a 2 guilds to make FFA become reality.<P>I think there is one guild on Luclin that would be fine with it going FFA, if another stepped up to the plate and went FFA on it, the list would fail instantly.<P>------------------<BR>Sollwin Lifestar<BR>53rd Halfling Vicar of Bristlebane<p>[This message has been edited by Sollwin (edited 06-01-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>You can't implement a system that doesn't reflect the reality of power on the server.<P>If a server has one uber guild that knows they can walk in take every ragefire they want, and a level 51 cleric approaches them and tells them there is now a waiting list for Ragefire and their clerics need to get on the list if they want it...

</FONT><HR>There's an old saying of "you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink". In a consequenceless and equal environment this translates to "You can propose stuff all you want but you can't make the strong listen to the weak". In the world of EQ, all it takes is one person to say they won't listen and there goes the whole thing. So saying that we could have a calendar if we really wanted one is incorrect.<P>Every server just about seems to have gone through a "calendar phase" at some point. Luclin is in the middle of theirs since they are a newer non-split server. Many people started new chars and guilds there to escape the politics of the older servers. But it's inevitable that it will catch up to them. Already, Luclin has large guilds and it's only a matter of time before one or more decide to go "uber". Which means their calendar will collapse, just as it has on the other servers. It may not be inevitable, but I seriously doubt Luclin can forever avoid the petty bickering and greed that consumes the rest of the servers. Utopia is a myth. You might build a paradise today but it's only a hop skip and jump to Hell from there too.<P>Enjoy your peace while it lasts, Luclin. <P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>What they have said is true.  On Fennin there are basically two uber guilds and everyone else if a full level below them.  Those two are filled with the most immature, cranky, greedy, and potty-mouthed people you would ever meet.  When a guild routinely takes Fear just to get Cazic while kicking out the smaller guilds that are interested in planes armor, you think they are going to let themselves be far down on a list to get epics?<P>I kind of agree with Boanerges.  Fennin had a very successful calendar at first, and it largely held up, then the epics came.  The contestion over Cazic and Inny mostly destroyed them and ended any semblance of one.  The smaller guilds still use it, I think, but it is more of just a notification that they will be there.  The uber guilds will be in Hate/Fear the night after a patch killing Cazic/Inny whether you like it or not.<P>If you don't mind filling us in on how the rest works, how is Cazic/Inny decided on Luclin?  Does whoever has the night get to try them, or does some other guild take over for that night?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Xegony will never go to a "calander system". There are at LEAST 3 or 4 BIG guild who state time and time again that they do not recognize any calander. <P>There is a place you can go to on Xegony to try to do things with other guilds if your guild isn't big enough.<BR> <A HREF="http://www.xegonyalliance.com" TARGET=_blank>www.xegonyalliance.com</A> <P>However, as I have recently discovered, planning a raid for weeks in advance, gathering the people, setting up the groups and then getting to the day and discovering an ubder guild beat you to it is the norm. You set up a raid to leave at 9pm, and an uber guild went at 7 or 8. You set up a raid for 5, they go at 3 or 4. Simply by doing a /who all GUILD, /guild "hey, we got 35 people online, lets go to hate before XA can go"<P>These uber guilds know about Xegony alliance and seem to go out of their way to make sure it doesn't work.<P>Why? Because they can, pure and simple. And no one can force them to do otherwise.<P>I am glad it works on Luclin. I hope it continues to work. But how long will it be before some guild with 400 members finds out that their favorite cleric has a pearl but is # 39 on your "list" and decides to make him/her #1? Just because they can.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well i never said it was going to be easy. If you don't like what the Uber Guilds do to you then do it back to them. And keep doing it until they will listen to reason. <P>I am on Xegony as well and I know about this xegony alliance thing, it's great and these uber guilds just ruin it. I think it's high time the little people take it back. unless of course you are all happy with the way things are and you like it when they ruin your raids?<P>A friend of mine in a pretty big guild on Xegony was in a Trak raid. They had just finished buffing and were just about to start the raid when out of no where this monk comes running in and pulls trak to where they were all getting ready. killed the entire raid. Then while they were rezing everyone the other guild stormed in a killed trak. If this is the kinda **** you like then just sit around and do nothing like you all have been doing but stop complaining. either you wanna do something about it or shut up about it. I for one am sick ta death with hearing you all complain and whine about ragefire and who KSed who and "why are the fates so cruel" boohoo, and then when someone suggests you do something about it, instead of coming up with ideas to alleviate the problem you come up with excuses.<P>well here are some ideas. You get all the little guilds together, make a web site with a list of every guild who agrees to this. Anyone not on the list will never be ressed, buffed, teleportted, helped or any other nicety by guilds that are (not including non guilded people) this especially applies to guilds that refuse to join up. If guilds take over your raids, then all the guilds come to help. FD train them, make them go through the same **** they put you all through. <P>I'm quite certain that there are more people on any server who are not in uber guilds than there are in the uber guilds. Let them know, through actions and not whining, that it will not be tolerated anymore and a calendar system WILL be put into effect and anyone not complying with that system will be dealt with in the proper manner. <P>or you can all just sit and whine some more, do nothing and wait till armagedon till you all get your epics. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The best two ways you can think of to bully guilds into your alliance are both bannable.  I'd certainly think twice about joining with someone who told people to do those things.  That whole "He who fights monsters should be wary lest a monster he becomes" thing.<P>Uber guilds are largely independent, and don't need your rez, group, or ports.<P>Lets see:<P>1. Do your best to hinder them.  No grouping/rezing/porting/etc.<BR>Drawback:  They do not need you for these.  Maybe it makes them go out of their way a little to get their own cleric there, but you likely would need these from them more than they need it from you.<P>2. Don't help them on their raids.<BR>Drawback: They don't need your help.<P>3. FD training.<BR>Drawback: You get banned.<P>4. Tell spamming.<BR>Drawback: Everyone who does it gets banned.<P>5. KSing them whenever they plan a raid.<BR>Drawback: You aren't uber and can't KS.  They laugh at you and let you help them kill the mob.  You then get banned for trying to KS.<P>6. PLoot their mobs.<BR>Drawback: You get banned.<P>7. Call PNP on them.<BR>Drawback: GMs will not back this on non-30 minute mobs.  Your guild can't kill the uber mob anyways.<P>8. Gather an equal force and petition to allow both sides to roll for the right to fight the mob.<BR>Drawback: Your guild likely cannot kill a lot of mobs they fight, or have excessive downtime doing so.  At best you get half the kills and piss them off.<P>On a blue server there is basically nothing you can do to another person to stop what they are doing, besides things that will get you banned.  If you are so intelligent and creative, please list a way you can make a player do what you want without getting you banned.<P>"You think they aren't gonna listen when every other guild on the server is crawling down their necks and forcing them to go on the list???"<P>Crawling down their neck in this game is either stopped by a simple /ignore command or considered harrassment and bannable.  Forcing someone to do anything is therefor impossible.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>There are lots of ways to screw an uberguild within the rules if you are imaginative about it.<P>- Uberguilds do need others to port/rez/group with. Not having cooperation of others slows them down a lot and makes them less able to screw with others. You do not need them at all. They will rarely help you anyway as they are too busy with their own stuff to bother.<P>- You can mess up the plans of an uberguild while going about your business. I found this out while killing dorfs in thurg b when an uberguild moved in to kill the Dain. It was impossible for them to do so while we were there.<P>- Uberguilds can only be in so many places at once. Consequently they can only screw with one other raid at a time. If there's a dozen raids going on on a server then 11 of them will proceed normally no matter what the uberguild does.<P>- If stuff happens like the story above with the monk training a Trak raid, a petition and email from all the members of the Trak raid can get the monk banned for sure, and can possibly get others in that guild banned as well for participating via coordinated action. In some cases it can get the guild disbanded as well by the GMs especially if there is a pattern of doing so.<P>Things that are bad ideas:<P>- FD trains, hello bannsville<BR>- KS attempts, you can just forget it you'll never win a power battle with an uberguild<BR>- harrassment, not only do you risk your account but you probably spur on more antisocial behavior and feed egos with the attention<P>There is a particular uberguild on my server that... irks me. I regularly rez members of this guild on the way to carrying out my own business. If they had to bring over their own cleric everytime this would result in a huge inconvenience for them. They know it too which is why they have yet to screw with anyone else's raid.<P>Rather than the top two guilds I find it tends to be the ones almost at the top who are the least considerate of others' raids, they're so busy trying to take over the leaders that they'll step on anyone to get there.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

All it does is formalize the long wait for the majority of Clerics and make it easier for Clerics in small guilds to get the item.  The solution for any mature server is an increase in the spawn or some other alternative to eliminate the bottleneck.  While Luclin may think their list is the cat's meow, I really doubt any Cleric who finds themselves 67th on the list would think it was all that great.<P>And Aean, I read your posts and I think I can say with some confidence that you aren't such hot **** yourself.<P>Rayne<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Rayne (edited 06-04-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I actually did try to get a list solution on Tarew Marr.. and it got a lot of support, but we have several uberguilds and they would have none of it.  There were 2 guilds in particular that refused... and the list just has no point if those guilds will just walk in and take it as the little guys are still calling people on the phone and pulling in their buddies from wherever.  <P>As for Reign's comment about how you probably wouldn't like it if you were 67'th on the list.   To a point you are very correct.. it would suck being on the bottom of the list, but I know I'd rater be 67th on the list than not have a list.. at least I would know that when it was my turn it was mine.   As it is right now I have no way to ever finish my epic... unless I quit my job for a while  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>Templar of Tunare, <BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>"but at least I am trying to do something about it and not sitting around and whining."<P>The things you are trying to do are not going to matter (No porting/rezing) or bannable (FD training, spamming).<P>I'll be the first to admit that I'm a quiet person in RL who doesn't particularly stand up for themselves.  However, in three days last week I managed to make three large guilds on Fennin horribly mad at me, just by sticking up for myself and telling them the truth.<P>As soon as I can think up anything or anyone can bring up something that would actually change the ubers mind, I would go along with it.  Until then it is simply easier to accept that I won't ever turn in the pearl that is in my bank.  Who really cares about items anyways?  Not like the epic helps me when I'm not in an uberguild anyways.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
