<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">grouchiegrumbles</div><div class="date">07-25-2001, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently have a crew of people in tower of frozen shadow.. this is a great spot to hunt for clerics... the first 2 floors are undead... and the 2nd floor is pretty easy to get singles/doubles.... if you root park, easy to get singles... they do cast, but your stuns will come in handy to rectify that...<br />
<br />
to get a key to 2nd floor, you kill undead on the first floor.. supposedly til all the first floor mobs are dead.. upon killing last mob, a undead gnoll spawns, kill him, and he has the key to the 2nd floor. undead in tower of frozen shadow DO run, so you will need to snare or root em.. on 1st floor they run to zone in spot, and basically just sit there and take the beating... becareful of KS'ers here tho.. lots of people think all they need to do is get the one key, and then they can go everwhere.. that isnt the case... ToFS is definitely designed with groups in mind...<br />
<br />
on the second floor, when you kill random mobs, you will get an angered librarian that will spawn... kill that angered librarian to get keys to level 3...  but I would stay on level 2 til high 30's... or at least til you beat hell 35...  Also, level 3 is not undead...  OOH, angered librarian can also carry students homework, or teachers syllabus... in our 3-4 hours there, we received 2 of each, and our whole party got keys to 3... <br />
<br />
on level 2 students are blue cons to a level 32, and scholars and angered librarians are yellow cons...  we had a full party, so it wasnt too bad... I dont recommend hunting librarian or librarian assistant.. they were REAL tough, and did not seem to have any loot.. just stick to scholars and students... we actually sat in the back hidden room NEAR the exit mirror(note: exit mirror takes you out to iceclad.. its back in the far left corner behind a book case when coming from level 2 zone in... NOTHING can see you on this level if you are IVU'd<br />
<br />
just some thoughts...  I really like hunting in tower, and exp is great...<br />

<br />
We all showed up there at level 30 - 32.  The regulars are 2 clerics, a necro and a pally.  On any given night, we have added a second pally, a rogue or a monk.  A couple times we've had a chanter, third pally or druid.<br />
<br />
This place is great xp.  As of last night all of the regulars have now dinged 34, with about 3 hours a night of xping.  We decided to move to the second floor and it's actually even easier with the crew we have.<br />
<br />
We set up in the zone out, buffed and medded to full and absolutely rocked the place.  Yes the mobs in the library are casters, but this just means they have very few HP compared to the mobs on the first floor.<br />
<br />
In 1 hour working the zone out, I made 3 blue bubbles of xp in 34.  I had second thoughts about spreading the word about ToFs, but I figure with Luclin and at the rate we are leveling I might as well pass along the info.<br />

Fastest key I saw was 5 minutes, longest was 45 mins. I've seen people randomly killing everything on the first floor for literally 4 hour straight before and not get a key.<br />

Floor 2 is especially nice, since he could use wandering mind on most every mob on the floor.  The experience gain was rather good for me, and he ended up getting some xp, too.  I walked away with a syllabus, he got a syllabus and homework, not too bad at the time.</div></div><hr />
