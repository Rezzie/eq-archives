</FONT><HR>a good friend of mine is one of the best damn necros i have ever seen. he is usually the primary healer in my group, while i chain stun. here is his explanation of how he works his magic.<P>baguette ovenfresh<BR>58th cleric<BR>---<P>Many folks have aspired to be a necromancer and often ask my advice on being a necromancer. I am quite flattered to get asked questions and do my best to oblige in any way I can. However, as I have journeryed for over two years, I have come to rank many of my high-level necromancer friends as to their performance. I do not mean this to sound arrogant or mean spirited but the truth is some people just plain stink at being a necromancer. A few guildmates have encouraged me to write a guide on necromancers. What I have decided to do instead is share some tricks, secrets and tips that I have learned in my travels. <P>Gather around you aspiring young adventurers and if you listen carefully and study hard maybe just maybe one of you shall be worthy enough to call himself my apprentice. Necromancy is a magical art but one that demands patience. If you wish to whack your opponents down in a blinding display of power go visit the Magician guild. Fear. To be successful in this art you must overcome fear in all its forms. I do not tolerate cowards. <P>Life force this is what a necromancer has dominion over and can manipulate with great easy. Lifetaps or taps are the necromancer’s spells that does X damage to a mob and heals the necromancer for X damage. This spell is NOT a nuke. If you desire to go whack something down in glory go visit the Magician or Wizard guild. A lifetap is the most inefficient spell a necromancer has in their arsenal of offensive weapons to do damage with alone. However, to heal a bubble of health and do a tad of quick damage to the mob, they are one of the best spells in the game. There better be another reason a necromancer is tapping a mob when he/she is at full health other than to do damage to the mob. Knowing when to use taps is essential in learning hitpoint/mana management. You will also learn that those pesky healer types have itchy heal fingers, sometimes its best to let them now when you desire healing otherwise you are not being efficient. <P>Necromancer healing can be quite efficient in the right environment. In fact, after reading this some clerics might just turn green with envy. A necromancer’s healing ability to others comes late in their career (after level 44). In fact, calling it a heal is a bit of a misnomer, it is actually a life force transfer from the necromancer to the target. This will be a long discussion so get comfortable my listeners. The spells needed to successfully do this are as follows: <P>Pact of Shadow: Level 44 <BR>24 second transfer of 300 hit points over time to target from necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 10 <BR>Casting time: 2 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 12 seconds <P>Shadowbound: Level 54 <BR>24 second transfer of 500 hit points over time to target from necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 10 <BR>Casting Time: 2 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 21 seconds <P>Corporal Empathy: Level 44 <BR>Instant transfer of 215 hit points to target from necromancer (Ouch!) <BR>Mana Costs: 200 <BR>Casting Time: 3 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 9 seconds <P>Bond of Death: Level 49 <BR>54 seconds DoT drain of 720 hit points from monster to necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 360 <BR>Casting Time: 7 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 10 seconds <P>Vexing Mordina: Level 57 <BR>54 seconds DoT drain of 1,098 hit points from monster to necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 495 <BR>Casting Time: 5.5 seconds <BR>Recast Time: Instant <P>Normally, when I am doing this I am in lich form, which is converting 32 hit points into 32 mana whether I am sitting or standing, and have the best possible regeneration spell I can get on me (regrowth adds +15 to my regeneration). When the mob is pulled into camp, I cast Bond of Death (“Bond” or BoD) on the monster, thus starting the hit point flow from the monster into me. BoD is a very low agro spell, so there is very little risk of me taking agro from the main tank. By the time I have BoD up on myself, the tanks are down about one bubble, I can then cast Pact of Shadows (Pact) and/or Shadowbound on the targeted group member transferring hit points from myself to the party member. By just doing this one rotation I get the following results: <P>380 Mana used for healing of 800 hit points and damage to target of 720. Compare this to the cleric spell Celestial Healing, which does 748, hit points of healing for 225 mana in the same time frame. <P>Now that sounds ok right? Well here is where it gets really juicy! Notice the recast times on the pacts verses the BoD? During the time I have one BoD going I can cast 4.5 Pact of Shadows or 2 Shadowbounds or a combination thereof. Ack you think I have committed suicide right that’s more hit points than I have – HaHaHa you fearful little toads. The Pacts act as DoT on me, so when I recast them it just overrights the previous casting thus I never take full damage from the subsequent pacts but the party member gets the full benefit of the heal. I generally only need to cast one quick tap sometimes two depending on the length of the fight to restore my own hit points. Now after I have multiple pacts cast for 1 BoD I can get the following results: <P>380-410 Mana used for healing of 1,300-1,700 hit points over 24 seconds for the party, while the mob has taken 720 damage from BoD and maybe another 320-640 from a quick tap or two (1,040 – 1,360 damage total to mob). Compared just to the cleric Celestial Healing spell the cleric would require 2 castings for 450 mana to heal 1,496 hit points and done zero damage to the monster. If the cleric isn’t already green, well this will make you want to barf. After I have done all of that, I have already liched back all or most all the mana I used while the cleric will be lucky to have medded back a small portion of their mana even with clarity II. Remember lich generates mana for me standing or sitting, it is just that while sitting I get the normal regeneration boost in hit points and mana to make me even more efficient in medding. <P>Now while I am doing this, my hit point bar is going up and down like a roller coaster. I am already losing about 15 hit points per tick from lich alone after you factor in regrowth. Casting one pact and one shadowbound costs me 800 hit points in 24 seconds. The multi-casting will cost me another 437-450 hit points maximum (that’s 4 pacts cast or 2 shadowbounds for one BoD), this is the incremental hitpoint costs I will get waiting for the spell to recycle through before I overwrite it again. That’s a total of 1,700 hit points flowing out of my little blue body maximum in under a minute without factoring in lich. To counter all this loss of life remember BoD is healing me 720 hitpoints in 54 seconds and 2 Defluxes get me 640 hitpoints in six seconds, so I can do all of this and only be down 340 hit points in after a full minute. I am able to take these swings in hit points now because my hit points with cleric buffs are 2,500 approximately and I have 1,500 approximately with just equipment and no buffs. <P>I have found that the primary healer in the group really needs to understand necromancers and how this tactic works if the group is to be truly the most mana efficient. I am ALWAYS aware of my hitpoints during any fight, and know exactly how far I can push this, and where I will be at the end of the fight with hit points most times. If the primary healer is healing me cause they see my hit point bar jumping up down like a pogo stick they are wasting mana. If I get in trouble, I will let the healer know, otherwise they must trust me and what I am doing. <P>While I have other more efficient spells to cause damage to the monsters, none of them are quite as group friendly as this little tactic. Take the 1,040 damage from this tactic; add my pet’s damage and that is still a nice contribution to offense alone for basically zero mana usage during a fight (I factor in my liching to offset mana costs). Adding in the healing is a huge bonus to the group and is a more mana efficient than letting the cleric do all the healing. With a necromancer supplementing the healing a group can pull almost non-stop cause the cleric can keep pace mana wise with the pulls. A good necromancer should always be able to keep up in mana with any group. <P>One downside to doing this is I need the buff slots to do it. If I get grouchy cause someone casted extra buffs on me its because I need those slots to pact/bond. Remember the bond and vexing are a healing dot on me so that is two buff slots taken. When I use pact and shadowbound that’s two damage dots on me so there goes two more buff slots. Consider I am in lich with a regrowth, which uses up two more buff slots. In total I need six buff slots to do this out of my 15. I prefer to have my shielding and DMF buffs up at all times so that brings me down to only being able to get 7 buffs. If the cleric has cast Heroic Bond and a symbol on me that only leaves me room for 5 buffs. It doesn’t happen a lot but when the group gets buff happy it can cut into my ability to function if my buff slots are filled up with things I do not need as a caster. <P>When I hit level 57 I get my BoD upgrade Vexing Mordina, which will drain 1,098 hit points in 54 seconds and give to me. The other really, really sweet thing is it stacks with BoD, so in reality I can have 1,818 hit points flowing in with these two spells alone and doing the same damage to the mob at the same time. HeHe I can not wait to test my limits with this new spell. <P>Corporal Empathy can be handy in raids but I seldom use it when in experience groups. Unlike the pact spells it transfers immediately 215 hit points but costs me 200 mana. It is handy to shot one of these off if you don’t think the cleric is going to get that CH in on the main tank in time. <P>For me the fun is nonstop casting during the fight. Mob comes in cast BoD, send in pet, Pact, Shadowbound, Pact, Pact, Pact, Deflux, Deflux mob dead and I am still good to go for mob number 2. If it’s a long fight I can add a second or third dot to the mob and still avoid agro. When I did the pit in Icewall with a cleric, shaman, druid, ranger, and monk, I did all of this and added two dots to the target and always finished with more mana than any other caster. Now watching my hit point bar, the groups hit point bars, my mana bar, my pet and its health, and switching back and forth on targets not to mention group chatting, well my fingers get a good workout. HeHe. I will admit though when I am casting multiple pacts on multiple party members, I have to really concentrate and remember who has which pacts going on which members. When we did Howling Stones and the rogue got some nasty HTs taken, I hit her with both pacts and the cleric hit her with Celestial healing, in the rogue’s own words “Wow a hitpoint explosion!” <P>For advance tactics try throwing in ghetto mezzing, but that’s another topic for another day. Have fun my fellow adventurers. Oh and by the way these tactics are hardly any known secret but I find many necromancers that do not known anything about them. In addition, many seem reluctant to try them as well. It definitely is not a tactic for the weak of heart. <P> <P>PS I sacrifice my apprentices in the end, there can only be one true power in Norrath and it will be ME!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Extremely interesting.  I'd wonder why I hadn't seen something like that before, but all the necros I know quite playing very shortly after Kunark came out.  They all made monks.<P>Nice to see smart people find a way to use their spells better, but you'd probably better hope this doesn't fall into the hands of VI.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by baguette:<BR><B>a good friend of mine is one of the best damn necros i have ever seen. he is usually the primary healer in my group, while i chain stun. here is his explanation of how he works his magic.<P>baguette ovenfresh<BR>58th cleric<BR>---<P>Many folks have aspired to be a necromancer and often ask my advice on being a necromancer. I am quite flattered to get asked questions and do my best to oblige in any way I can. However, as I have journeryed for over two years, I have come to rank many of my high-level necromancer friends as to their performance. I do not mean this to sound arrogant or mean spirited but the truth is some people just plain stink at being a necromancer. A few guildmates have encouraged me to write a guide on necromancers. What I have decided to do instead is share some tricks, secrets and tips that I have learned in my travels. <P>Gather around you aspiring young adventurers and if you listen carefully and study hard maybe just maybe one of you shall be worthy enough to call himself my apprentice. Necromancy is a magical art but one that demands patience. If you wish to whack your opponents down in a blinding display of power go visit the Magician guild. Fear. To be successful in this art you must overcome fear in all its forms. I do not tolerate cowards. <P>Life force this is what a necromancer has dominion over and can manipulate with great easy. Lifetaps or taps are the necromancer’s spells that does X damage to a mob and heals the necromancer for X damage. This spell is NOT a nuke. If you desire to go whack something down in glory go visit the Magician or Wizard guild. A lifetap is the most inefficient spell a necromancer has in their arsenal of offensive weapons to do damage with alone. However, to heal a bubble of health and do a tad of quick damage to the mob, they are one of the best spells in the game. There better be another reason a necromancer is tapping a mob when he/she is at full health other than to do damage to the mob. Knowing when to use taps is essential in learning hitpoint/mana management. You will also learn that those pesky healer types have itchy heal fingers, sometimes its best to let them now when you desire healing otherwise you are not being efficient. <P>Necromancer healing can be quite efficient in the right environment. In fact, after reading this some clerics might just turn green with envy. A necromancer’s healing ability to others comes late in their career (after level 44). In fact, calling it a heal is a bit of a misnomer, it is actually a life force transfer from the necromancer to the target. This will be a long discussion so get comfortable my listeners. The spells needed to successfully do this are as follows: <P>Pact of Shadow: Level 44 <BR>24 second transfer of 300 hit points over time to target from necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 10 <BR>Casting time: 2 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 12 seconds <P>Shadowbound: Level 54 <BR>24 second transfer of 500 hit points over time to target from necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 10 <BR>Casting Time: 2 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 21 seconds <P>Corporal Empathy: Level 44 <BR>Instant transfer of 215 hit points to target from necromancer (Ouch!) <BR>Mana Costs: 200 <BR>Casting Time: 3 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 9 seconds <P>Bond of Death: Level 49 <BR>54 seconds DoT drain of 720 hit points from monster to necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 360 <BR>Casting Time: 7 seconds <BR>Recast Time: 10 seconds <P>Vexing Mordina: Level 57 <BR>54 seconds DoT drain of 1,098 hit points from monster to necromancer <BR>Mana Costs: 495 <BR>Casting Time: 5.5 seconds <BR>Recast Time: Instant <P>Normally, when I am doing this I am in lich form, which is converting 32 hit points into 32 mana whether I am sitting or standing, and have the best possible regeneration spell I can get on me (regrowth adds +15 to my regeneration). When the mob is pulled into camp, I cast Bond of Death (“Bond” or BoD) on the monster, thus starting the hit point flow from the monster into me. BoD is a very low agro spell, so there is very little risk of me taking agro from the main tank. By the time I have BoD up on myself, the tanks are down about one bubble, I can then cast Pact of Shadows (Pact) and/or Shadowbound on the targeted group member transferring hit points from myself to the party member. By just doing this one rotation I get the following results: <P>380 Mana used for healing of 800 hit points and damage to target of 720. Compare this to the cleric spell Celestial Healing, which does 748, hit points of healing for 225 mana in the same time frame. <P>Now that sounds ok right? Well here is where it gets really juicy! Notice the recast times on the pacts verses the BoD? During the time I have one BoD going I can cast 4.5 Pact of Shadows or 2 Shadowbounds or a combination thereof. Ack you think I have committed suicide right that’s more hit points than I have – HaHaHa you fearful little toads. The Pacts act as DoT on me, so when I recast them it just overrights the previous casting thus I never take full damage from the subsequent pacts but the party member gets the full benefit of the heal. I generally only need to cast one quick tap sometimes two depending on the length of the fight to restore my own hit points. Now after I have multiple pacts cast for 1 BoD I can get the following results: <P>380-410 Mana used for healing of 1,300-1,700 hit points over 24 seconds for the party, while the mob has taken 720 damage from BoD and maybe another 320-640 from a quick tap or two (1,040 – 1,360 damage total to mob). Compared just to the cleric Celestial Healing spell the cleric would require 2 castings for 450 mana to heal 1,496 hit points and done zero damage to the monster. If the cleric isn’t already green, well this will make you want to barf. After I have done all of that, I have already liched back all or most all the mana I used while the cleric will be lucky to have medded back a small portion of their mana even with clarity II. Remember lich generates mana for me standing or sitting, it is just that while sitting I get the normal regeneration boost in hit points and mana to make me even more efficient in medding. <P>Now while I am doing this, my hit point bar is going up and down like a roller coaster. I am already losing about 15 hit points per tick from lich alone after you factor in regrowth. Casting one pact and one shadowbound costs me 800 hit points in 24 seconds. The multi-casting will cost me another 437-450 hit points maximum (that’s 4 pacts cast or 2 shadowbounds for one BoD), this is the incremental hitpoint costs I will get waiting for the spell to recycle through before I overwrite it again. That’s a total of 1,700 hit points flowing out of my little blue body maximum in under a minute without factoring in lich. To counter all this loss of life remember BoD is healing me 720 hitpoints in 54 seconds and 2 Defluxes get me 640 hitpoints in six seconds, so I can do all of this and only be down 340 hit points in after a full minute. I am able to take these swings in hit points now because my hit points with cleric buffs are 2,500 approximately and I have 1,500 approximately with just equipment and no buffs. <P>I have found that the primary healer in the group really needs to understand necromancers and how this tactic works if the group is to be truly the most mana efficient. I am ALWAYS aware of my hitpoints during any fight, and know exactly how far I can push this, and where I will be at the end of the fight with hit points most times. If the primary healer is healing me cause they see my hit point bar jumping up down like a pogo stick they are wasting mana. If I get in trouble, I will let the healer know, otherwise they must trust me and what I am doing. <P>While I have other more efficient spells to cause damage to the monsters, none of them are quite as group friendly as this little tactic. Take the 1,040 damage from this tactic; add my pet’s damage and that is still a nice contribution to offense alone for basically zero mana usage during a fight (I factor in my liching to offset mana costs). Adding in the healing is a huge bonus to the group and is a more mana efficient than letting the cleric do all the healing. With a necromancer supplementing the healing a group can pull almost non-stop cause the cleric can keep pace mana wise with the pulls. A good necromancer should always be able to keep up in mana with any group. <P>One downside to doing this is I need the buff slots to do it. If I get grouchy cause someone casted extra buffs on me its because I need those slots to pact/bond. Remember the bond and vexing are a healing dot on me so that is two buff slots taken. When I use pact and shadowbound that’s two damage dots on me so there goes two more buff slots. Consider I am in lich with a regrowth, which uses up two more buff slots. In total I need six buff slots to do this out of my 15. I prefer to have my shielding and DMF buffs up at all times so that brings me down to only being able to get 7 buffs. If the cleric has cast Heroic Bond and a symbol on me that only leaves me room for 5 buffs. It doesn’t happen a lot but when the group gets buff happy it can cut into my ability to function if my buff slots are filled up with things I do not need as a caster. <P>When I hit level 57 I get my BoD upgrade Vexing Mordina, which will drain 1,098 hit points in 54 seconds and give to me. The other really, really sweet thing is it stacks with BoD, so in reality I can have 1,818 hit points flowing in with these two spells alone and doing the same damage to the mob at the same time. HeHe I can not wait to test my limits with this new spell. <P>Corporal Empathy can be handy in raids but I seldom use it when in experience groups. Unlike the pact spells it transfers immediately 215 hit points but costs me 200 mana. It is handy to shot one of these off if you don’t think the cleric is going to get that CH in on the main tank in time. <P>For me the fun is nonstop casting during the fight. Mob comes in cast BoD, send in pet, Pact, Shadowbound, Pact, Pact, Pact, Deflux, Deflux mob dead and I am still good to go for mob number 2. If it’s a long fight I can add a second or third dot to the mob and still avoid agro. When I did the pit in Icewall with a cleric, shaman, druid, ranger, and monk, I did all of this and added two dots to the target and always finished with more mana than any other caster. Now watching my hit point bar, the groups hit point bars, my mana bar, my pet and its health, and switching back and forth on targets not to mention group chatting, well my fingers get a good workout. HeHe. I will admit though when I am casting multiple pacts on multiple party members, I have to really concentrate and remember who has which pacts going on which members. When we did Howling Stones and the rogue got some nasty HTs taken, I hit her with both pacts and the cleric hit her with Celestial healing, in the rogue’s own words “Wow a hitpoint explosion!” <P>For advance tactics try throwing in ghetto mezzing, but that’s another topic for another day. Have fun my fellow adventurers. Oh and by the way these tactics are hardly any known secret but I find many necromancers that do not known anything about them. In addition, many seem reluctant to try them as well. It definitely is not a tactic for the weak of heart. <P> <P>PS I sacrifice my apprentices in the end, there can only be one true power in Norrath and it will be ME!<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>Great, now necros are going to be hated by more of the other classes now.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Smirk, 53 Necro<BR>Cemi, 48 Cleric<BR>Xev Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Necros are nice for some light healing but this guy failed to account for recast time on the pact spells. From the time you cast your first pact spell it will be 16 seconds before you can get another pact on a different group member (2 sec refresh delay on all spells + 12 recast delay on pact + 2 sec cast time on pact). <P>If the necro is on the ball and casts the instant the spells refresh he would have taken 150 dmg from the first pact (75 hp loss per tick). The necro can essentially heal 2 members for 300 hp each and lose 450 hp himself since he will lose the full 300 on the last pact. The ratio gets worse with shadowbond since the spell recast delay is 21 secs.<P>I have a high level necro and I have never been able to get the heal ration this guy is claiming.<P>Vanya</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Interesting ideas.<P>I use the lich/bond/pact 90% of the time but only pact my pet and twitch for the mana hungry clerics. I never realized that pact just overwrites the current pact though. I've had a few close calls liching/pacting myself to death so I don't think I'll be jumping into the healer role.

</FONT><HR>What Vanya said is correct.<P>Pacts aren't cumulative ontop of themselves, any more than CE is cumulative with itself.  If you chain cast 3 CE's on a person, over any 24 seconds they'll heal the same rate as if one CE was cast on them.<P>The numbers posted at the top don't add up unless he's healing separate people.<P>The nec can heal MULTIPLE, different people and get by with only one drain buff on his screen, and increase rate of healing over the group.  But he can't heal a single person more than 800hp over 24 seconds.  (500hp over 24 seconds if shadowbound overwrites pact of shadow)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am, or was, a necromancer.<P>Necro healing is really nice, but not quite that nice. Firstly, it essentially requires constant combat in order to work, which is great for those 15 minute fights when everyone is two bubbles down and VLOM for the last 10, and in fact, those were my favorite times in EQ. But, if you can't have a constant flow of meaningful lifetap damage, it falls over. <P>Pact/Shadowbond also have recast times you aren't including, and Lich isn't quite -tha- godly, it's 32 HP for 20 mana, not 32. <P>But yes, necromancers can do some awe inspiring things in fights they haven't been systematically prevented from participating in.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Vanya is correct, it is impossible to get near the heal ratio this person claims.  A necro cannot top celestial cleansing.  Also, stacking pacts on ONE person does nothing.  And in most groups there is only 1 tank taking the damage.  Basically pact is a dot on necro and heal dot on target.  You only get super good healing efficiancy when you have multiple targets to hit with that heal dot, while the necro is only taking damage from one dot.  Aslo it is impossible to stack shadowbond on more than one target.<P>I would like to add that necroes are HIGHLY underrated in groups.  Yes, Clr/chanter/warrior are the staples.  But if you add a necro to that holy trinity I guarantee you will find safetly levels going up and efficiency going WAY up.  Well.. a good necro that is.<P>I know a lot of plain dumbass necroes that dont even use lich, they sit in c2 and just send pets, cast snare and mana pump the cleric.  I highly encourage you to boot this necro from your group and send him back to skyfire.<P>a few other mistakes in this guide:  Lich is not 32:32.  it's 32:20.  And yes it works when you are standing, but c2 works while standing as well, so it's not a big deal.  (although, any necro that prefers c2 is a fool)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Heya:<P> I intend absolutely no offense to anyone, but I'd be hesitant to take advice from someone who doesn't know how Lich works.<P> What do I mean?  Apparently, if you parse the spell file, Lich should indicate that it swaps 32 hps for 20 mana.  With regrowth up, you'd theoretically be dropping "about 15" hps per tick, right?  Except... remember when PvP damage was reduced by a third?  Yeah, that applied to the Lich series of spells, too.  So, actually, Lich swaps something like 21 hps for 20 mana.  Very nice.  Note: Verant is absolutely, positively, 100% aware of this.<P> Credentials: Not a big deal, really, but to show how often I've cast Lich (and Bond of Death and Vexing Mordinia, and this and that and the other), I've got a 59th lvl Necro with a birthday Jan 1st 2000.

This is a long time when you usually kill a mob in 30-60 seconds.<P>Second is the fact that in most groups only one toon is taking any dmg.  The primary tank.  You can however stack both pact and sb for 800 hps of healing.  You will need to use either Vexxing or a deflux after the BoD wears off to maintain hps tho.<P>Third problem is, the only way to be able to do this much healing, like he claims, is to Pact one person, SB the next, Pact, SB etc.  Well the only time thats required is when something is using AE attacks.  When is the only time you get attacked by AEs?  Thats right raids.  What can you not use on ubermobs that are the target of raids?  That right, lifetaps or Bod type spells.<P>That said .. a necro can supplement a clerics healing enought that, yes, you can pull nonstop in a regular exp group.  Give it a try and see, but dont be too jealous guys.  Clerics are still by far the most efficient healers in the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><BR>My necro (level 60) is my main, and I do believe necros are very useful in XP groups. Not only can we do things like this (help with healing), we can also snare, do limited crowd control apart from dishing out 4-5k damage / min with pet and dots / DDs. <P>Still pact is mainly good for a steady pace of single pulls. If we get jumped and casters start dropping etc, pact just won't cut it. <P>With a shaman in group as only healer, I use pact to help with healing since shaman is working full time slowing anyway.

</FONT><HR>What's the difference between regular and raid grouping? Well for one, you can't run a pact-rotation to keep a main tank alive. In regular groups, you don't normally fight mobs that can't be slowed, or that quad fro 600+ damage. <P>Raids have more than one group for a reason. The mobs have insanely high hitpoints that can't be removed efficiently by a small group of people. Similarly, they hit hard enough that they often require special healing strategies. <P>Basically, there are TONS of differences in regular and raid groups. I know it doesn't really seem like it when all you are raiding is PoF and PoH, but it will become more evident later on, trust me. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007057&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007057&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
