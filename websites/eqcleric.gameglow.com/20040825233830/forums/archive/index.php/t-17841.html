<br />
We started hunting Kunark dragons years ago and Venril Sathir before the usual moves to Temple of Veeshan, NTov, Sleeper Tomb to equip primals, then Luclin and Ssra, and were 2nd on the server to reach Vex Thal. After a few months farming VT, we then moved to Plane of Powers at release and are since a few months Elemental planes enabled. We have Fennin Ro and Xegony shields in our bags, are PoEB keyed, and are geting very close to get our shield from the 2 other gods for Plane of Time access.<br />
<br />
Our strength, -combined with our experience, skills acquired during all this past history, dedication of the members-, is a very good base equipment, one of the top equiped guilds on the server, because thats how we work and progress with our low number of people and give everyone a chance to get the best out of the places we hunt in. We are friendly and not pressuring for attendance, though we expect most members to be able to raid at least 5 days a week. We raid 7 days a week between 8:30 pm and 12 pm on GMT+1. Our motivations and moral are on top actually as our strength never stop growing.<br />
<br />
We may accept serverwide applications (can server-move with all gear nowadays) if you are preferably european (we care about an eventual change in your playtime if you are not euro, so be sure you can match it), play on eurotime (GMT+1, EST+6), are flaged or close to be flaged for Elementals and have 150+ aaxp. Send a tell in game or post in our recruitment board with your past history.<br />
