<br />
The items you are looking to get made are VERY rare on any server. The skill required to make them involves the prior expendature of 1000's of pp (perhaps even 10kpp or more just to get up to the skill needed to have a chance at making it).<br />
<br />
In the server market, the &quot;easy&quot;/low end pieces in this wish list would most likely sell for 1kpp or more. The higher and more difficult pieces (bp, greaves, cloak) would most likely fetch 3-5kpp.<br />
<br />
My advise if your determined to get these pieces made would be:<br />
<br />
1) go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqtraders.com&quot;&gt;EQTraders&lt;/a&gt; and post a message looking for a GM dwarven smith on your server<br />
2) Tempers... if you want to get these pieces made, gather up all the required temper ingredients with numerous extra's... lava rocks and drops of mercury are a major pain to get, and along with smithing skill level, are the limiting factor in Cultural Dwarven Smithing right now.<br />
<br />
I can't speak for other smiths... but if somebody came to me with all the required ingredients (tempers, already enchanted ore, leather paddings, molds, imbued gems, etc...) I would most likely drop what i was doing and make the attempt(s) for them for free or at minimal costs for my time alone... Unfortunately, nobody ever does that. If you want the smith to do all the legwork in getting these pieces made, you can fully expect to pay a premium price. If you show the interest and desire by bringing all the required ingredients there is a distinct possibility that your smith will /faint (lol) and be happy to make the attempts for you... especially if you bring extra tempers.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to give you some information that may help you in getting your pieces.<br />

<br />
My skill is at 192, I have stopped smithing cause it<br />
got terminally boring, but I still have a stock of<br />
Dwarven Imbued on the Druzzil Ro server (no use<br />
for you unfortunately).<br />
<br />
But prices on my pieces ranged from<br />
1500PP on the collar (easier, but amazing) to<br />
5000PP on the Breastplate and Cloak (wow<br />
is the cloak simply amazing).<br />
<br />
A full set of 8 of the 'good' pieces (Helm, Cloak,<br />
Collar, Breastplate, Vambraces, Greaves, Boots<br />
and Gauntlets) was 25KPP.  And worth every penny.<br />
<br />
There are MANY better options that the girdle and<br />
the bracers, and the veil is a waste too (and of course<br />
Adamantite Epaulets are just prime).<br />
