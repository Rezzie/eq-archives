<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizdaar</div><div class="date">07-02-2000, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been a lot time since this little trick has been posted (it isn't mine, as much as I'd love to take credit for it).<br />
<br />
In large raids, it's sometimes difficult to keep everyone alive, especially if a groups healer is a druid/shaman.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, you will hear &quot;Make an assist soandso key!&quot;.  Don't.  I have a standard /assist key, and that's it.<br />
<br />
Several reasons for this:<br />
1) Clerics don't need to assist the primary tank right away.<br />
2) Assist is buggy at times<br />
3) It takes a lot of flexibility away.<br />
<br />
The flexibility it takes away is this:<br />
Target the mob (either by assisting one of your tanks to get the mob, or by targetting it) to see who it's hitting.  You can keep on pressing it to usually re-target the mob and then see who it's beating on again.<br />
<br />
This usually allows you to react very quickly to the &quot;/shout Heal soandso NOW!&quot; calls to save a life.<br />
<br />
If I want to stun a mob, I have a general rule of assisting one of my tanks (they have the /assist soandso key). If they aren't in melee yet, stunning isn't a good idea.  Once you have a mob targetted, wait until it's HP goes down a bit.<br />
<br />
Waiting for the HP to go down ensures that you have the right mob and that the tanks are on the agro list quite a bit already.  A resisted stun is a very efficient taunt, which is why you want to wait.<br />
<br />
This has turned into a bit of a raid advice post... so here is one more.<br />
<br />
Try to keep Stun (yes, the level 5 stun) loaded.  If you see an enchanter in need of help mezzing a mob, use Stun only!  The reason is that stun is our only non-damage stun spell.  If it goes off after a mob is stunned, no harm done.  It can help enchanters *a lot* if they are struggling to mez a mob that is pounding on them.<br />
<br />
Of course, if that enchanter is in your group, you are probably healing them.<br />
<br />
Again, you can target the mob to hit your /assist hotkey to target the enchanter (usually easier to target a mob than a player) to see if he needs a heal before stunning the mob for him/her.<br />
<br />
Most of this works in a single group play situation, but it helps a great deal when in a multi-group raid.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bz</div><div class="date">07-02-2000, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Niz, this is good advice, with the exception of one point.  In large multiparty raids, the wisest course is to make TWO hot keys.  One for &quot;/Assist&quot; and ALSO one for &quot;/assist soandso&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason for this is twofold.<br />
<br />
1.  Having an &quot;/assist soandso&quot; hotkey means you WILL be on the right mob to start.  Out of everyone in the raid, they are the one person you can trust to be on the right target.<br />
<br />
2.  Casters don't usually have their autoattack turned on, and this means that as you are spamming your /assist key to flip between the mob and their target, that every time he aggros on a caster, you can't assist them to retarget the mob.  The quickest thing to do when you end up targetted on a caster you can't /assist to retarget is to &quot;/assist soandso&quot;.  This is often nice to do because it I find that if you reassist soandso, then assist the mob and get back to the caster again, you know that the mob is QUITE upset at that caster, and you can pause and watch his health for a moment.<br />
<br />
Just something I've found to work very well for me in the past.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suriya</div><div class="date">07-02-2000, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do this all the time!!  The two /assist keys is a good idea, I've done it sometimes, but usually I just do it with one.  When I get stuck on a caster or someone without a mob targeted, I just target one of my tanks to get back on the mob and keep /assisting.  I am usually sitting down while I do this, also have no melee weap in my hand, so if I accidentally target the wrong mob, its not a problem, I just reorient on the right mob and keep /assiting.  I've saved a lot of lives this way. =)<br />

I hit F8 (target nearest mob) and then punches my normal /assist button. If there are more than one mob, I often move around a bit and repeat until I get the enchanter targeted...if I do, I often stay a bit to ensure that he or she lives.</div></div><hr />
