Everything on the first level except for a skelleton lord conned green. After killing the skelleton lord in a few seconds of root and nuke (was way too easy -g-) I jumped up on the center stone which I then discovered was a pit. <br />
<br />
I landed in a room filled with creatures that promptly killed me. My paladin friend thought she'd come down and rescue me and died just as fast.<br />
<br />
It took about an hour or so of /t to various high level people before a friend of mine in High Pass contacted an aquantance of his in West Commons, who went to the druid's ring and managed to gather a party to clear out Befallen.<br />
<br />
I got my first raise (and an exp raise at that!) at level 16 and extreemly greatful to all those that came to help so that I wouldn't have to start killing decaying skelletons for money to buy new equipment.<br />
<br />
I decided to leave Befallen and went to High Pass, and I'll try it another day when I have maps. I don't think it's very dangerous at the first and maybe second level, but if something does go wrong it becomes very difficult to get keys or assistance. Or at least, that's how it seemed to me.<br />
<br />

I will write back in with my experiences.</div></div><hr />

When I was younger I soloed in there all the time, now however it is filled with more dark elves than undead and it is no longer a cleric friendly place. I went in at 30 with a 46 monk and we had a hard time getting down to the basement. Had I not been there the monk would have died. I used to be able to roam freely at level 20 but now it's very dangerous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exeteroth</div><div class="date">08-10-2001, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I checked out Befallen and while it definately isnt the rumored Clerical wonderland of olde it isnt that bad.  Truthfully it is pretty rough.  At 14 I am having trouble just getting past the entryway let alone into any of the true undead.  Right now my strategy is zoning in, pulling the aggro of the dark elf guards right inside the zone, taking them down (between 1-4) and then zoning out and medding.  Rinse and Repeat.<br />
<br />
At 14 they con blue and proc lots of xp so I am betting they are a high blue.  Killing just one makes up for the xp loss if you die.  If you have bind I would definately suggest binding in the tunnel leading to Befallen as it makes a good place to bounce back after death...  and you WILL die, only a matter of how many times.<br />
<br />
One last word of advice... DO NOT SIT no matter what the reason as you will inevitably aggro everything on the first floor that can get at you.  Example, I sat to med and then I got attacked by a Plague Rat...  no biggy con'd green.  Well it ran early and escaped down the stairs into the adjoining room where it picked up friends, 2 greater skeletons, 1 DE Shadow Knight, and 1 reanimated servant (Earth Elemental)...  I got rooted by the elemental and died quickly.<br />
<br />
You are prolly wondering if it is worth the risk at all? Probably not, but Sr Apprentice Robes are common drops and you can sell those for some plat.  Bronze Sigil of Tvyill also seems to be a common drop as well, but it is no drop soooo not all that useful.<br />
<br />
Last note, the DE followers seem to come in 4 varieties that I have seen thus far, Mage, Necro, Shadow Knight and Rogue...  take down the casters first but make sure you dont ever turn your back to one of the rogues, they backstab for around 150 points.  Shadowknights seem to be particularly nasty also.  Ideally if you can pull your quarry back to the zone hall you can protect against backstab and be able to concentrate on the casters.  Normally I would say this is a big no no, but on Veeshan Befallen is a dead, I havent counted more than 8 people when I was there, and most of then were down on the low floors camping.  there is a similar shielded hall opposite the zone hall that you could pull to if you are worried about affecting people when they zone in.<br />
<br />
I will probably be here a bit as I am terminally lazy and dont want to ride the boats back to faydwer and hit Unrest.  It has been way too overcamped of late.</div></div><hr />
