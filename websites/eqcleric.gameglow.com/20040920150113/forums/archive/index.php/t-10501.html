Excellent experience, at the lake not far from the zone, but the higher level trains there are fairly frequent. They usually path in a way that avoids the lake area, but often someone will accidentally pull part of the train up there anyway. Just be ready with the Divine Aura, and make sure your group understands what Evac means - or leave without 'em if they don't. Have gone from 20-23 here in about a week.</div></div><hr />

Took a look at MM this am, and promptly ran out.  I group with a level 21 ogre warrior.  Stuff was red, and looking tough.  The few other people in the zone were much higher.  <br />
<br />
Could Verant have &quot;beefed up&quot; this zone?  Do ppl usually go here with a large group?<br />

I visited it last a few weeks ago and while the critters near the enterence were all red, after getting a small group and going to a fairly safe area I saw yellows and blues, and reds that were quite killable with a group (Actually tested out my stun spells for the first time there). I should probably go back there soon, actually. NOT a solo place tho yet and I generally only have an hour or so to play during the week. And yes, the groups I was in were from 3 to full..but at night, so there were LOTS of people there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thessalian</div><div class="date">03-21-2000, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for the very late response...     http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

It's very possible that the reds you were seeing near the entrance were the remains of a train. They take a while to walk back. If possible, go in invis and run straight out to the wall behind the lake, and then take stock of the situation. It also might help to check one of the bestiary sites so you have an idea what you're dealing with. Low to mid 20s groups can handle pledge familiar, initiate familiars, and I think the Grinning Gargoyles. Watch out for casters among the familiars; these need to be taken out first - stun stun stun. I believe Glyphed Ghouls, and Glyphed Familiars may also be doable if you have a strong group with good tanks and don't get swarmed with initiates at the same time. <br />
<br />
Some nice group members to have here enchanters with area mez, and Magicians with an earth pet to provide repeated roots.<br />
<br />
Often the trains will not come back behind the lake - but if they do your group needs to evac immediately. This is one situation, especially in low 20s, where there is not a lot of point in trying to hang around and save people. If you get a castle train (frequent) you will die. If you group tries to stay and make one last kill, they will die. Evac needs to be early and often. It can be frustrating, because trains take so long to clear sometimes, but I still believe the experience and benefits overall are worth it. You can fight close to the zone, non-binding classes can bind nearby in GFay (right at the LFay zone line), and you can sell at the nearby ranger station in LFay (if someone isn't kiting them). <br />
<br />
One other quirk of MM: Due to the *BIZARRE* pathing everywhere in this place, and numerous graphical bugs, I have on at least one occasion unjustly accused someone of training on our group. It can really look like it, because trains will run up from such odd directions. Take a deep breath and think twice before getting your blood pressure up in this place. <br />
