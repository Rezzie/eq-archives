<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenobe</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Me and a druid buddy head to NK to hunt down Regis.  We get there a another cleric is camping his spawn spot.  I talked to him a bit and didn't know he had to kil Zhal first, and he was alone and 24th.  So I tell him about the quest and how both are blue to me at 35, he said &quot;cool&quot;.  Now I thought he meant cool, he would of killed me, but I was wrong....  So we fight griffons for an hour and zhal pops.  We run over and take him out  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  We run to Regis and he is there, but so is the cleric.  We sit to med a bit and debate if we should pull him or not.  I was going to offer the young cleric that we all fight him and random for loot rights. The druid tells him we killed zhal, which made him spawn, and we are going to pull him.  Too late, the young cleric says &quot;watch out im pulling him&quot;.  Well he is getting his butt kicked and I know that even if I heal him he wont be able to kill Regis.  My druid buddy wants to let him learn his lesson through death, but I think thats to harsh.  Before we could decide what to do he paniced and ran off.  <br />
<br />
Well it ends up that he lived, we didn't steal Regis and the young cleric  ran right into the WW hunters  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif  <br />
<br />
Then he got mad cause he said he waited here 2 days for this spawn??  I found that strange that someone would wait that long and not know the details of the quest and be mad that the WW hunters saved his hide.<br />
<br />
I know that if we pulled him one of us would have the bracer, but feelings would of been hurt.  What do you think?<br />

Hard to say since he had to run to the WW hunters to save himself anyway.  Also you are right that he should have known what was going on with those things before he was camping them.<br />

<br />
healing is helping<br />
<br />
if you dont, your intentions will always be up for interpretation<br />
<br />
and some people dont check sites before doing quests.....it can be either ignorance, or a wish to play the game as a game, guess thats open to interpretation if the person isnt vocalizing why too huh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Zahal always be dyin' 'ventually.  He path always be takin' 'im t' th' guards, so ye dinnae be needin' t' go kill 'im.  Killin' Zahal yerself jus' be speedin' th' process.<br />
<br />
Ye dinnae be obligated t' be 'elpin' th' young lad kill Regis.  If'n 'e be unable t' kill 'im, that be 'is own problem.<br />
<br />
If'n ye'd bin takin' 'im from th' young lad, ye'd 'f bin kill-stealers.  It dinnae be seemin' fair since 'e bin unable t' kill 'im by 'imself, but that be th' rules.  Th' firs' one who be attackin' a critter 'r be attacked by a critter be havin' th' right t' it.<br />
<br />
Ye bin doin' th' right thin' by lettin' 'is fight play out t' th' end.  Th' only other right action would 'f bin t' be 'elpin' 'im win th' fight an' git th' loot fer 'imself.<br />
<br />
Nex' time fergit lookin' fer Zahal an' jus' be campin' Regis' spawn spot.  That way ye be havin' th' right t' 'im.<br />

If he wouldn't yield or accept your offer of /random (which then makes him a complete idiot) I would have NOT helped him get the kill.  Instead, once he ran I would have rooted Regis, atoned a few times, and then taken him down.  That cleric lost his rights to the kill once he ran off.<br />
<br />
That cleric was a complete idiot, in my humble opinion (Regis throws Wrath, so he's 29 at least).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sphynkl</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I would have rooted him from the start and when the cleric ran, I would have then taken him out.  <br />
Poor guy was just ignorant of the quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tfboc</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing as how he had nobody coming to help him out, I think you would have been justified in taking the kill. Rather than just outright taking it though, I agree with the rest that taking over the battle once he ran would have been best. He can scream all he wants afterward, fact of the matter is he didn't have the firepower. This happened to a guildmate of mine when he went to kill the aviak in OOT. Someone was already there but she wasn't high enough to solo him. My guildmate explained he had people coming to help him take it out and that she would get slaughtered if she tried to do it solo. While she didn't like the fact, she accepted it and let him have the kill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes you have to look at it situation by situation.<br />
 In yours I'd have helped him kill regis and let him loot it. Then explained to him the error of his camping it alone, and the nature of several predatory farmer types. (INSERT your server's known KS EBAYER FARMERS ETC ETC here).<br />
<br />
 I have a different way of dealing with things on bertoxxulous. It may get laughed off at first by the parties involved, or it will cause instant remorse and cries for forgiveness.<br />
<br />
 1- AHEM We're engaging this spawn. (KS'rs froceed with the Kill) I then proceed to do the following.<br />
  a- Target said person if they are ROLE or ANON and /guildstat take note of the guildnamed.<br />
 b- Call off my group so as to not waste anymore mana or risk our health.<br />
 c- /Log open<br />
 d- Contact said guildleaders immediately if online...<br />
 e- Screenshot of the conversation and persons actions in case said guildleaders want them (never been asked for em so far)<br />
 f- tell teh person in open says. You have won this battle and stolen a kill from us. Yes there will be others. But you sir/madam have lost our respect and the chance of us ever helping you again. So shall our friends know this, so shall your name be entered into the book of grudges. And yes. All clerics shall know of your actions. Should you die, and yes it will one day happen. No succor shall be yours. No Heals, no rezzes, no aide in the recovery of your corpses. (sometimes, okay often, it's not this winded, but I'm on a roll here flow with it okay?)<br />
 g- I then inform 3-5 of the online clerics I know or at random of said person's actions and to tell their friends.<br />
 h- The word of a lvl 50 cleric carries allot of weight (YES I AM 50 NOW WOOOOOOHOOO, sorry had to slip that in there). If I am playing an alternate. I will tell the person who I am and that I remember. I watch.<br />
<br />
 Thing is known KS'rs TRAINERS and general Aholes have ended up in groups with me in planar runs, dragon or FG raids and in Kunark dungeons. my first words to them...<br />
  Do you remember me....I have a book and your name is in it...<br />
  I pause and then I say, &quot;Look how one with honor works, you are in my care now, I will not let you die on my watch. And if you do, I do too, and with honor and Valor&quot; &lt;&lt;-- got to say that once only, but it was great fun.<br />
 Thing is KS'rs and folks I swore I'd never group with again, if they have a choice demand that I group with their group on multi group raids.... I wonder if I should tell em I'm an Evo specialized cleric????<br />
 Ever see what a stunned mob does when he's stunned for 10-12 seconds consecutively?<br />
 They DIE...and die fast.  <br />
<br />
 But back tot he topic (puts away his own horn)<br />
<br />
 You can walk away from such a situation and hope for another chance at a later date. Aide  the youngster and hope he learns a lesson in compasion he can pass on to others in the virtual world.  Or lasley you can swear vengeance on a KS'r and make their life miserable on your server. Or you can compromise and do all three. Carrot, stick, the lil black book....all have their uses and place. Often others knowing you carry all three can stop a problem before ir starts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenobe</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the replies.  To make it a bit more clear.  I could of pulled Regis and killed him, but decided to let the young cleric try anyways, and in that amount of time the WW hunters got cloes enough that if he didn't run to them they would of run to him  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif  So in the end we all learned from it.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough last night I got a port into NK and went over to check for Regis the 10th time that day.  Bam he was there!  I tell my druid buddy and he starts to head over.  I med up from 30 mana and he gets lost  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif  So it takes him atleast 5 mins to get there.  We pull him and toast him, yeah!<br />
<br />
Then.. a group of 5 peeps from the same guild show up and are mad cause they said they killed Zhal and we stole Regis  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Well after a lot of talking and explaining and debating on how the quest works they were still mad.  I later found out that one of my guildmates was with them when they kille Zhal so they think he told us to run over and kill Regis...  That was not true.  I also pointed out that they should of at least shouted &quot;killed Zhal coming to get Regis...&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a quest that is waiting for trouble and I thought I would be very happy getting my second bracer but after all of this I'm just glad its over. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed Kenobe.  I remember a few months back when I was looking for my 2nd bracer and getting queried about why someone in full EM would want the bracer (I'm not even close to full).  I don't think the druid was even high enough level to take Regis (druid was very green).  Regardless, the next day there was a post slamming me for being a farmer and camping the spawn spot.  Sigh.<br />
<br />
I suppose if I had to kill him solo I would just pull Zahal along to the spawn spot, maybe taking him near the Treant (or maybe better to avoid the Treant).  Both times I got Regis he was just up and waiting.<br />
