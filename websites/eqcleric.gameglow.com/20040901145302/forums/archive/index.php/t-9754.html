Yesterday I was with a tank(warrior), and he stated that he didnt need ac.. (he had 157STR and was a wood elf.. AC was around 600 he said.. and that was lvl 35. I had almost 600ac at lvl 31.. <br />
Myself, I feel a tank that go for ALOT of ac items and max that out good is the best tank for me. I would rather have the fight last a little longer than to have to heal 2x as much. a Warrior in the group are there to take the damage, not deal most damage.<br />
Monks, rogues, wizards are there to deal the damage and make the group successfull.<br />
I am thinking of making myself a list of bad tanks and good tanks :-(<br />

Of course, i'm not a tank, so i don't see a big difference in it, but if someone wants to tell me AC is better than WIS for a cleric, i DO know that answer.  I suppose its perspective, my normal tank has all AC gear, including those diamondine earrings from MM with 3ac or something.  But the paladin in our group goes all dex/agi/str, since most times he doesn't get hit, he's more of support melee (we have an enchanter, so usually the warrior class takes the beating, and the paladin just wacks away as best he can)<br />

Not trying to Start an argument, just curious as I'm thinking of starting a new Character.<br />

Couldn't solo a ghoul when he was out of mana at level 18.<br />
<br />
My current one, could solo a ghoul at no mana at level 14. Depends on what you like. My current cleric is now 27 and at about 130 wis without going wis item shopping greatly yet. (I'll remedy that later, but for now he has to tank for his group, so I have to sacrifice everything for ac, dex and str, just to survive)<br />
<br />
Depends on what you want. If you're looking to be straight out support, work on wisdom, but leave about 100 str to carry bronze with. You won't be able to carry much loot, but you'll be able to wear a full set of bronze armor. If you're looking to be tanking/melee/healing/nuking, then even up your stats a bit. Try for 100 str, at least 90 on dex, 80 on agi minimum and toss the rest into wisdom. I've found it to be a very good balance. Tanking blues and sometimes even soloing them at 27, so it does work. I'm also seeking out some of the new cleric armor as it buffs those same stats that let me keep tanking longer. Keep in mind, in a full group, especially one that has other seriously armor-clad characters, you're primarily a healer. When you end up in a group of all casters, clerics, druids, enchanters, wizzies, you'll find you could make an excellent backup tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally love my AC and can account for probably over 50 times it has saved my hide. I prefer to balance my AC and Wisdom at the same time.  I use mostly wis jewlry and some wis armor here and there and am covered with a large amount of bronze and other high AC armor.<br />
<br />
The more powerful the armor the less dmg you take, ask any warrior about that. That is the reason why monks in leather take max dmg for a lot of hits while warriors in bronze and crafted take smaller amounts of dmg. The same works for clerics.  I'd rather wear a bronze breastplate for now than a bloodstained tunic for the small amount of wis it gives.<br />
<br />
Like most things in life, the key is moderation. I choose to balance my wis and AC, but this is by no means the ONLY way to do it. But by all means do not tell all the clerics reading this that anyone using good AC items are fools and that all wisdom items are the key to victory.<br />

<br />
I currently have 724 ac, which is more than some tanks I know around my level (39).<br />
<br />
Of course, some of this can be attributed to me not using any weapons at all...:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">painbringer</div><div class="date">12-06-1999, 08:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go the other way and say wis all the way  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
sure a high elf in leather isnt preferable to a dwarf in plate, but a high elf in banded...  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
at low levels the dwarf is alot easier to play, and often ends up better, but at high levels the high elf will usually have more ac, and be able to heal more. i found my ac of 765 was helping me alot at lvl 45.. i went on a FG hunt with a dwarf cleric that was at 680.<br />
<br />
at high levels str dont matter. and high elves can choose a set giving the 200 wis with alot better ac than the dwarves can, so im happy with my high elf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanar</div><div class="date">12-10-1999, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, maxing Wis is not that important.  All you really need is a good team with a good backup healer so that you can med up while the other healer takes over.<br />
<br />
Or, during the higher levels, having the backup healer doing the top-up healing after the fight, while you med.<br />
<br />
If you lose party members in a fight, it can be attributed to one of the following :<br />
<br />
The group has had too big a lure for it to handle<br />
<br />
There was a train that caught the party<br />
<br />
You (the cleric) were not doing your job (shock! I don't like to accuse any cleric of not doing their job well enough, but some clerics don't know how to function properly)<br />
<br />
Summary:  It just boils down to how you work.  Don't worry too much about getting 200 Wis.  Just concentrate on using your mana effectively (eg stunning thos damned spellcaster MoBs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khuul</div><div class="date">12-13-1999, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well<br />
<br />
The higher base wisdom you have the more &quot;pure&quot; AC gear.<br />
<br />
Wisdom over 200 does little now but the difference is how much items you need and how much AC you sacrifice to reach the 200.<br />
<br />
Thats the reason I think HE is better than dwarfs. When both have 200 wisdom the HE will have higher AC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be fair to the tank, Warriors get a lot of defensive skills to let them avoid getting hit in the first place.  If he had sacrificed AC for Agility, I think it would have been a good decision.  As it stands, he isn't a real tank.  You would be far better to get a ranger than him for a tank.  Wood elfs do have very high Agility though.  Perhaps he also has good agility stuff.  If not, yeah, I would say he is a pure fool.</div></div><hr />

A friends level 27 Ogre warrior twink has STR 174, agi 85, dex 90, ac over 700. My twink consistantly takes less damage in fights vs the same MOBs as my friends twink that is 2 levells higher and almost 200 ac higher, heh.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">12-24-1999, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Balance is everything. No matter what is lacking there's a mob somewhere that can take advantage of it. My DE cleric has great natural agi (90) wis (118) but awful strength (65). My priority has been to get enough str items that I can wear heavy armor in all the other slots without being dangerously close to encumbered (you know, when you get that five copper split and all of a sudden You are encumbered!). In this case str is an insurance policy for my agility and my bank account (back to poverty after buying enchanted plat and level 29 spells). My secondary priority has been not wis or ac but magic resistance - doesn't matter how much mana I have if I've just been feared or nuked to cinders, and because of the cleric's advantage in resistances I like to make myself the target of enemy casters - they will do a third of the damage to me that they will do to my tank. Third priority is a balance of ac/wis items, favoring ac somewhat as I am rarely at full mana anyway. Fourth priority is pushing dex and charisma above the 25-notch levels (75,100,etc). Last thing I worry about is int since I have so much of it anyway, and it comes with a lot of +wis items as well, they will be +wis +int.<br />
<br />
I would probably have the same priorities if I was a high elf or erudite or gnome because they have the same strengths and weaknesses. As a dwarf I would probably go for wis first to increase the tank to a respectable size, the agi to avoid getting pounded, then all the ac you can get as you hardly have to worry about encumbrance even in full bronze plate. Next would be int so that melee skills and secondary spell skills (i.e. divination) wouldn't lag too far behind.<br />
<br />
In sum I say that whatever your racial weaknesses are should be your priority. One mob who can exploit this weakness and it doesn't matter how good the rest is. I would assume the same goes for other classes as well.<br />
