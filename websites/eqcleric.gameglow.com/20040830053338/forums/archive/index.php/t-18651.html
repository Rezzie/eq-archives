<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flintnilf</div><div class="date">04-16-2004, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild(Harmonium, Xev server) is recruiting clerics but i feel compelled to explain things a bit. We are the top guild on Xev. We have been the top guild on Xev since the server split that formed it. Previous to that, we were the top guild on Povar, yes, with Triton on the same server. <br />
<br />
We raid 4 days a week, and we do NOT, under any circumstances, raid on Fridays, Saturdays, and Mondays. Raids start at 7:30 pm eastern. We finish endgame content close to the very top guilds in Everquest. We have been in Plane of Time for months and will probably finish Uqua within a day or so of the 1st guild that beats it, unless of course they beat it on a Thursday!<br />

We have some extremely talented and dedicated players, as you'll find when you join. However, if we hit a brick wall on a raid, it may get cancelled. We're here to have fun, and raiding for 10 hours while things are getting figured out is not fun. Officers figure out solutions to raids when they're at work daydreaming or on dates. Yes, we do a lot of figuring out at the encounters, but we're not spending more than 4 hours doing it. Sometimes our best thinking is done while we're relaxed and doing something else. <br />

before you join that 7 day a week raiding guild, check us out.</div></div><hr />
