And I *really* do not understand a lot of what I see...not here, but thru the &quot;Search for Abashi!&quot; link. It seems that the vast majority of the posts on other web sites, especially the main EverQuest one, go along the lines of &quot;Kill Abashi! Burn down Verant! Lynch them all!&quot; or &quot;Stop lying to us, I am going to get some lawyers and sue you!&quot; or perhaps &quot;I spend as much on you each month as I spend in one day at McDonalds! Despite the fact that I won't complain when I ask for no pickles and get them anyways, because this is the internet, you haven't answered all my questions in the last ten minutes...WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE!!! KILL KILL KILL!!!!&quot; or perhaps &quot;I know you have answered this question 30 times in the last week, but *I* DON&quot;T LIKE THAT ANSWER!!! DON&quot;T you realize that *I* personally pay your salary! BOW DOWN BEFORE ME VERANT-ites!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, I understand that the game is not perfect... and that those forums are perhaps the best way to notify... but it seems to me that there are a lot of *VERY* angry people out there. I truly do not understand where all this anger and frustration comes from.. expecially when if I play even 3 hours a month I am getting a better value per dollar than if I rented a movie or went to the theater...<br />
<br />
Can someone help me understand the mindset of all the people screaming &quot;I HOPE YOU DIE!!!&quot; comes from?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is if you hate what your doing... why are you doing it type of thing.<br />
<br />
Best thing they can do is just lighten up and relax and play it for what it has, not what they want. For those... learn to program and write your own.<br />
