<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JesterDK</div><div class="date">12-30-2001, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While i have been on a few dragon raids, Trak a couple of times, Severilious a couple of times, Kodera Dal, Talendor, Vindicator (Tho not a dragon) and a few named in ToV that i cant remember the names of. <br />
<br />
I still feel i can learn some more. So i got a few questions.<br />
<br />
1) What spells do you have up ?<br />
2) Where do you position yourself ?<br />
<br />
ad. 1)<br />
<br />
I usually have the following up:<br />
<br />
- Complete Healing<br />
- Remedy<br />
- Divine Light<br />
- Celestial Healing<br />
- Heroic Bond (For group heals)<br />
- Free, depending on the sit. Word of Vigor, Cure blindness, Abolish Poison.<br />
- Free, same as above!<br />
- Divine Aura<br />
<br />
Ad. 2)<br />
<br />
Well, for mobs with AE nukes / dots i place myself under the belly of the dragon. Otherwise im standing a little distance behind the melee's but still in range for heals.<br />
<br />
Any info appreciated. And if you have any other tips on dragons / giants. Feel free to mention it... allways open for new ideas.<br />
<br />
Also... JanSorensen. Are you Danish and are you a Magic player from Randers ? Just curious. Then i know you  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Your spells and placement seems right to me. <br />
<br />
For Trakanon the level 57 WoR is usefull for the cure effect - atleast untill you have the dps to just drop him flat. I know you are not 57 yet but just wanted to mention it for the sake of completeness.  <br />
<br />
For giants, Yelinak, Sontalak and Klandicar I prefer standing near the edge of CH range as some of them have a bit of proximity aggro - but for others dragons I like the belly spot. For ToV dragons its all about finding a wall to hide behind   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

That middle slot is about all I change. Antidote for poison mobs, Counteract disease for Ssra and Rag's, Root/Trepidation if there may be adds, or heroism if it's likely they'll be some battle ressin to do.<br />
<br />
I always try to stand on the critters tail and back a bit unless the plan involves some kind of wall to protect the casters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">12-31-2001, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which spells:  Well it depends on the dragon.  If the dragon does an AoE damage, and depending on the amount of damage the AoE does or the effects, I will have either word of restoration (lvl 57 group heal, very useful for Trak or Hoskar and probably others) or word of redemption (lvl 60 group complete heal).  In addition to that I will have Divine light, Celestial Elixir and regular single target complete heal.  If the dragon doesn't do any damage AoE I don't have the group heals up.  If the dragon does a stun (ala Phara Dar, Wooshi, Sev), I will load up remedy for really fast casting heals.<br />
<br />
Where do I stand:  Where I have to cast group heals, I stand with the melee to make sure we all get healed.  If I don't need to group heal, I stand behind the melee farther from the dragon, and when appropriate I will sometimes be around corners and such to the dragons AoE effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiyre</div><div class="date">12-31-2001, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jerricoe I'm kind of confused at your spell line up.  Why do you have mark of karn taking up a spell slot when it is on your bp?  Also why don't you have any divine's up?  Not making those available to you is a death wish =(<br />
<br />
<br />
JesterDK your spell line up looks good.  Only suggestion I have is putting up divine barrier permanantly in one of your free slots.  Especially if you are running through tov to a dragon and are in charge of healing the mt, it really helps to have both divine's up when you get summoned.  Also if things go bad and everyone has to camp, casting divine before camping has helped save me more than once from ae's in time for me to camp out.  Or even for an add, its just always a good idea to have both divine's available to you.<br />
