<br />
My question is where to from here?  I like Kunark so far, so I was wondering where was good for a 35 DE to hunt?<br />
<br />
I appreciate any suggestions   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Thanks!<br />

I've spent the last few days near the Skyfire zone with some guildmates. I went from 35 to 40 in quick fashion. Would have been even quicker if it weren't for those couple deaths by Dragoons. I plan on hanging around another 3-4 levels.<br />
<br />
Everything in the zone is blue that I've seen at 40. No yellows, no greens, just blue. It's almost like being in an upscale South Karana, but everything walking brings experience. Get a group of 4-6 and watch the exp meter run.<br />
<br />
You can bind yourself inside Skyfire zone, just don't go in any further. <br />

I just got 35 in CT the other night (Felt good to burn my book).  Now what?  I feel a big push to get 39 so I can xp res people in the guild.  I know Kunark is great xp, but the travel there is a pain and find groups there is just as much a pain.  I was thinking about Sol B.  Am I too low for that?  I probably should just get some invis potions and head to lower guk dead side.  Is it true that Clerics and Pallys get some kind of xp bonus for killing undead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creadance</div><div class="date">06-03-2000, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best advice for level 34 Is Lguk its a cleric dream  from 34 to 50 I have probably made most of my levels in Lguk at 34 you can hunt the zone area, Bedroom, Spider room, Supply room. around 39 or so ou can start working your way into groups for the exe and savent, and cav area and even the fort around 45th level you are wanted in groups for Lord, Freenzied, magi and even the king<br />
so you see its pretty good exp thier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Head to the ghost room in unrest.. lotsa threads about it.. cant beat the exps from the ghost. If you get a full group you can pull the pit to.. sometimes the hall also<br />

<br />
Frontier is still good xp through 42.  Try hunting on the west side of the zone.  Go for DigiMasters, Rockshapers, Craigs, Brae, Brutes<br />
<br />
Overthere is good.  Stay away from the Sabertooth Tigers.  I think they are hard for their level.  Stick to birds, succulents and rhinos<br />
