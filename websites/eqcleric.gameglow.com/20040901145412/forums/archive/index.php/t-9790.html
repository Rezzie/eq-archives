<br />
Why is it that everyone thinks that someone owes them something for nothing?  I had just logged on in Ak' Anon and some little newbie gnome comes running up and says &quot;I got banned and have to start over can you give me any money or items?&quot;  Now first off I'm thinking to myself that is the wrong way to ask someone why would anyone want to help someone who got banned from the game.  So I told him that I just spent all my money on buying my tunic and have nothing (which was totaly false but I didn't want to help the little beggar) and went on my way.<br />
<br />
Well that was just one story the thing that really set me off was when I was playing my ranger a few days ago and I was sitting off to the side catching up on some fletching when I see the message XXX is inspecting you.  Now I really don't mind people inspecting me but then the guy has the nerve to say &quot;nice whip how much will you sell it to me for?&quot;  I told him its not for sale and he called me an A-hole and ran off.  Now is it me or is it just plain stupid to ask someone to sell a weapon in thier hand that they are using?  I mean what am I suppose to use after I sell it, my fists?   That just really peaved me that this guy would beg me to sell it then call me an A-hole for not selling it.<br />
<br />
Well there is my rant sorry just had to get it off my chest.<br />

<br />
So at level1 if you ask 10 people for some stuff you will hit on one person who will give you stuff. I just ignore beggers and/or powerlevel beggers as well.<br />
<br />
You can split a spawn for a low level party (which I do), or give someone a buff or rez etc but it has to be your choice.<br />
<br />
It just seems to get more and more common every day  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
And on people coming up and trying to buy something off of your body,I think that those are mostly people with higher lvl characters who are playing an alternate character,and they think that they deserve it more than you.They are almost more irritating than the beggars.But again I try to be nice as I tell them that they couldnt possibly use an item of such power,with such a weak mind./jk   <br />

<br />
I was running through Nro...and some guy had pulled 2 ghouls onto himself somehow and was shouting (not yelling), for help.<br />
<br />
Well I was near, cause he actually shouted pretty good directions, and ran up.  Someone else was already helping him, and I got my heal off a little too late to save that one, but the shouter was still fighting.<br />
<br />
So I buff him (good as a heal), and then sit and keep him healed.<br />
<br />
After the fight...Doesn't say thank you, just turns and inspects me.  Then badgers me to sell him my Mith BP.  It got so bad I had to put him on ignore.<br />
<br />
The other gent that died helping him, I ressed, buffed, symboled him...He bowed and thanked me profusely.<br />
<br />
And just the other day I was in kaladim, I get a tell from a 4th level paladin asking for anything that I can spare.  So...Normally I wouldn't even bother, but I had just come from the bank and was feeling good about my acquisition in Fear.  So I ask where he is....by the warriors guild.<br />
<br />
So I go take a look.<br />
<br />
Here's a lvl 4 dwarf paladin decked out in full bronze.  With a battle axe of some sort.  I told him..forget it...you have better equipment than I had when I was level 20!  Let alone level 4!  He said 'But you're level 50!...I'm like..so what?  Level 50 makes me a walking ATM Machine?  He said..yeah but I'm out of money...Well go kill some things you little Nert..sheesh..He tried a few more tells asking, but then gave up.<br />
<br />
Its like people that get everything provided for them in RL too.  They don't realize the value of a dollar (pp).  They are used to having things handed to them.  Its much easier to beg for things than to go do it.  <br />
<br />
Why kill snakes and bat?  They give you a couple silver at best.  Far easier to beg a wandering high level for 10-20pp...and far more profitable.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cinina</div><div class="date">02-18-2000, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sadly, I have to go anon whenever I enter most city zones lately  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif  You'd be surprised how many people will just do a /who on the zone and see what comes up and then send tells to that person begging for items.  My customary reply is &quot;Sorry, I don't give hand outs, as I've earned everything I own.  You may bring me 10 batwings and I'll see what I can do for you&quot;  And you know...the general reply I get is &quot;No thanks...I just want the money&quot;<br />
<br />
Another thing that happened to me last week was that I was in Greater Fay waiting for a friend to show up and people were on ooc asking about brewing and I was answering them.  So, I get a /tell from this wizard asking if I can make him LOTS of tumpy tonics...like several backpacks full if he gets the nuts.  He offered a foreman's tunic, green silk drape and 10 slot backpack for it as the deal.  I really have no use for the tunic or drape, but figured a guild member could make good use of them and I wasn't going to be doing anything for a while.<br />
<br />
So, I spent the next hour making Tumpy tonics while he teleports back and forth bringing me packs full of nuts (had about 100 made) when he suddenly notices my BS Tunic and HAS to have it.  Suddenly he's saying he'll take the 100 tonics I've made PLUS my BS Tunic just for the drape.  I turned him down politely.  He then tries to tell me that &quot;You can wear the Drape&quot;  Of course, I had to tell him &quot;No, clerics can only wear one robe in the game and that isn't it&quot; and he spent the next 10 minutes arguing with me saying that I HAD to give him my tunic because his friend needed it.  Finally, I told him that there was no way I was giving up my BS Tunic and he should let the matter drop.<br />
<br />
At that point, suddenly he doesn't want me to make anymore Tonics, and just asks &quot;Can I just have the tonics you've made so far and give you 100 pp&quot;  By this time, I was really wanting to be rid of that jerk, so I agreed to it.<br />
<br />
But he's hit my no resurrect list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's QUEST class! You go to Freeport, talk to this guy and &quot;BEGGAR&quot; shows up on your list of acceptable classes for starting characters!<br />
<br />
Note: Difficulty is extremely low in comparison to other classes in the game, and it is GM exempt! It can call people names, yell and scream at people if they refuse to help it, etc....<br />
<br />
On a more personal note? They need to be nerfed and started in a manner that they can be nuked to death by annoyed players, pretty much the same way a guard can beat down on a beggar....</div></div><hr />

I have no sympathy for the beggars. However, I will richly reward a lower level willing to do some work.<br />
<br />
After picking up the Ingot of the Constant last night I needed the plat bars. Headed up to Felweithe and /ooc'd for an enchanter to help me make a purchase.<br />
<br />
Level 4 High Elf enchantress came over and offered to help me out. She checked the vendor and told me her cost was 105pp per bar (much better than my 140 in full selling clothes!)<br />
<br />
I passed her 210 plat, then gave her an additional 20pp payment when she returned with the bars. Turned out she was a true newbie to the game and had never seen a platinum piece before  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
City Zone beggars annoy me as well (even low lever cleric beggars). I do what many others do as well - I ask them to do tasks for me while I am engaged in other things.<br />
<br />
I am a master brewer, and I like brewing Vodka and Bleeding Brains. Depending on my mood, I will buy roots for gold, or fire beetle eyes for one gold as well. Much better than what they get from a vendor. They have fun and I always offer to give them a drink (usually what I brewed or Hulgarsh - something very strong to get a low level character with minimal AT quicke drunk....)</div></div><hr />

Adapted from the message NPCs say to you when you get a critical failure in begging  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
And if they really persist and still continue to beg, I'll give them a copper and say &quot;Here Person Name take this and LEAVE ME ALONE&quot;.<br />
<br />
Adapted from the message NPCs say to you when you successfully beg a copper.<br />
<br />
And I think if I am really having a bad day, I will tell that person to target me and type /d to accept a donation from me. Then I'll say &quot;Beggars like you bring out the worst in me&quot;. Then beat the **** outta him.<br />
