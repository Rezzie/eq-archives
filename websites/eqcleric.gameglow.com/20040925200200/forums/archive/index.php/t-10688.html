Well as for hunting i am 43 and grouping in Dreadlands.. i find it to be good exp.I still have not been to guk yet but hear its uber for clerics because of all the undead..  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif I was wondering if there is any clerics out there that actually melee solo? I never melee.. i alwyas use the root/fear/wrath method when not in group... bu i wonder if there is actually clerics out there, that have built their melee skills that high..<br />
I have not really worked on my melee skills that much at all.. im too busy healing.. well that and also the fact that us clerics have the HP that of a snow bunny ... /snicker <br />
/jk .. so anyway.. if you are a cleric who uses your hammer for some whacking and can melee .. please post and tell me about it.I am interested ..   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />

<br />
HPs and AC aren't the problem - we are a plate-wearing class after all. The problem is it takes FOREVER for us to melee something to death because:<br />
<br />
Our weapon skills are capped at 175<br />
We cannot Double Attack<br />
We cannot Dual Wield<br />
We cannot Kick<br />
We cannot Bash<br />
<br />
And getting in melee range is a bad idea because:<br />
<br />
We cannot Parry<br />
We cannot Riposte<br />
We cannot Dodge (yeah we get the skill but when was the last time YOU dodged something?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/redface.gif)<br />
<br />
In general, it's far more efficient to med and nuke.</div></div><hr />
