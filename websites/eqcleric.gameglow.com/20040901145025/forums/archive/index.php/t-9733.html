<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering what people think about the Undead battles in Kithicor.  Personally, I am wondering if the same people who designed the clerical quests designed this &quot;event&quot;. My friend, a 32 Paladin, and I (22 Cleric at the time) tried to our hand in a couple of fights.  In every fight, we got our tails kicked.  The one fight in particular that showed how ridiculous the &quot;event&quot; was handled: a zombie trooper that conned blue to my paladin friend.  I dumped my whole load of mana into healing him (since I knew from previous fight my Expulse would be resisted), he (and I) still had to zone after dealing barely over 1/3 damage to the zombie.  I don't know what the &quot;target audience&quot; of the event was, but it was not a very good choice. Kithicor is a choke-point in the land of Norrath. There are very few ways to get from Freeport to Qeynos via non-magical means.  By cutting off Kithicor, Verant has made it very difficult to get through the area.  Using Kithicor was a good idea, just the mob's used was not.<br />
<br />
I have gone on long enough.  My opinion is the &quot;event&quot; was badly handled and poorly &quot;targetted&quot;.  What do you think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgrim</div><div class="date">11-16-1999, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I think you can hardly call the change to Kithicor an &quot;event.&quot;  Maybe you haven't been back, but it's still like that.<br />
<br />
[On further reading.... please forgive me, I'm posting from an IBM seminar, during the lecture, while I'm out of town and have no access to EQ... I may be wrong, and it appears that Kithicor may have returned to normal.  If this is true, I'll be highly pissed (and hopefully still able to retrieve some of my druid's things.... How long do corpses linger?  Anyway, the majority of my comments below still hold true, with the exception of anything referring specifcally to Kithicor still being a high-undead zone... if in fact the rumor is true.]<br />
<br />
Every night (in game time) from sundown until (technically) sunup, the whole place is simply crawling with those undead nasties.  And from personal experience and talking with other players, it sometimes takes until late afternoon in game time for many of the mobs to &quot;de-spawn&quot; during the day.  In any event, the place is NEVER free of undead.  I have a secondary character, a levle 7 half-elf druid, that got toasted TWICE trying to run, in broad daylight, through Kithicor.  Even with SoW I was easily whacked in one or two hits, once by something that came out of nowhere... not sure what it was, but it had a pet, as if it wasn't bad enough by itself.  Each time, I lost EVERYTHING, since there was no hope for a corpse recovery (not even the high-levels sitting near the HH zone were interested in helping me out beyond a SoW and  their well-wishing).  Of course, that is my fault, for attempting the run with all my worldly possessions (with the exception of Trumpy's head... safely in the bank) on my person... both times.  Does anyone really know what it's like to start from scratch at level 7 (and I don't beg for handouts, not even a rusty weapon... I did it the hard way both times: scrounge rat ears and bone chips, hope for a rusty weapon I could use from skeles and gnoll pups, and save up for a fishing pole and bait (I've found that I can collect a couple plat an hour by fishing, even with a 40 skill in fishing).  Boring, but an effective way to get back on your feet.)<br />
<br />
As far as the change to the zone, I have mixed emotions.  It was extremely bad since the effect is that low-levels now have basically no route from East to West Antonica<br />
(the Feerrott route, as well as the Runnyeye - Gorge route are probably just as bad).  I feel this the worst since my level 16 cleric is the highest of my 5 or 6 characters, and even he can't expect to make the trip safely.<br />
<br />
I don't see the problems with the quests, since I personally am not interested in the armor quests, but I think that reflects the poor planning that Verant has demonstrated time and again.<br />
<br />
However, I do applaud them for recognizing the evolution of the population of their servers.  With the bulk of players entering the mid- to higher levels, and previously few high-level zones to accomodate those players, Verant is trying (albeit in a poorly thought-out manner) to adjust things to maximize customer satisfaction.  This is shown with the re-itemization of Kedge Keep, addition of Plane of Hate, the even more recent change of Splitpaw to a high-level gnoll dungeon.  I was actually pleasantly surprised to be in the vicinity of last weekend's GM-run gnoll event in Qeynos Hills on Prexus (I think it may have run on all servers), even though at level 7 I was immediately killed by a couple of mid-30 gnolls.  The point was that I finally SAW a GM event after 5 months of playing this game.<br />
<br />
I think your last statement, <br />
<br />
&quot;Using Kithicor was a good idea, just the mob's used was not.&quot; <br />
<br />
is actually backwards.  Using the mobs they did was great, because it gives mid-level clerics a great new place to adventure.  Using Kithicor was a REALLY bad idea, because  of the strategic position that it holds, as a key travel route between two otherwise separate regions.  If they had added a zone OFF of Kithicor, or perhaps ensured that travel on the road is relatively safe, I could say that it was an ideal change.  One thing that I think has been rather overlooked is that Halflings are now more or less confined to Rivervale, Misty Thicket, and Runnyeye.  How would you like to be stuck in three zones for 10-15 levels?  (I can't be sure, but if I'm right, I think I read somewhere that low-level players are relatively safe running through Gorge of Xorbb, you just need to be able to duck through Runnyeye safely.)  Even still, that limits you to some fairly boring zones for quite a long time (the Karanas, while expansive, are fairly boring, and not particularly safe until at least your 20's).<br />
<br />
So, in my book, Verant gets an 'A-' for effort, but a big fat 'F' for planning and implementation.<br />

I, and another level 30 character, a druid, were running through Kithicor to Rivervale last night. We barely made it. The druid was struck by one spell and took two bubbles of damage (a tortured something) we never saw the creature and we certainly did not stop. At the entrance to kithicor the commander and his pet jumped us. Being so close to the zone I melee'd it. I wanted to see what Ghoulbane could do to it. In no time I was down to 2 bubbles and had to zone. I don't think I hurt him at all. I had a similar experience with an undead cleric this morning.<br />
<br />
Just to let you know that Kithicor Forest is very very very dangerous now.<br />
<br />
I don't know how I feel. It was certainly an empty zone before. And I can tell you that you can run through runnyeye (stay to the right wall) and the Gorge (stay to the left wall) at low levels. I ran through unsowed at level 8. Runnyeye is really no problem. It's the gorge and evil eyes that are the problem. They can (and will) charm you and pull you deep into the gorge.<br />
<br />
It seems like it was poorly thought out, but I think people will adjust<br />

Kith is just as boring as it ever was. Frankly, we'd love to have the monsters back. That had to be some of the most exciting hunting we've done since we broke into MM castle at low 30s.<br />
