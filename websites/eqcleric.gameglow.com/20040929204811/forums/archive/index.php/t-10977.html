<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zardnok</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has started to raid into Halls of Testing more and more as our member base increases their levels.  I was asked to write a guide to our guild clerics on tactics for Halls of Testing.  I welcome my cleric brethren to read through my post to our guild website and please give me some feedback and input about my guide so that I can update it as needed with additional information. <br />
 <br />
Cut and Paste of guide is as follows:<br />
<br />
Spells that I keep loaded in HoT:<br />
<br />
Celestial Elixir (Celestial Heal if &lt;59 used to top folks off after fight or to offset AE damage)<br />
Remedy (Gotta love the ultra fast save the caster spell)<br />
Divine Aura (Oh crap I am getting beat on!)<br />
Divine Barrier (Uh Oh... DA is burned and he still likes me!)<br />
Swap slot (usually have Word of Restoration up)<br />
Complete Heal (The granddaddy of all heals)<br />
Word of Redemption (The coolest heal spell I have! Group Complete Heal)<br />
Divine Light (A healthy chunk of HP in a moderate amount of time for a healthy chunk of mana)<br />
<br />
As you can see, I am a healer. I have 6 heals generally loaded in HoT to cover all situations and 2 oh **** spells. The key is to learn when to cast each healing spell for maximum gain.<br />
<br />
Before battle:<br />
<br />
Make sure that your entire group is topped off on HP and buffed up. Make sure that all tank groups have group Aego or the best symbol/HP buffs you can throw if no 60 clerics are in attendance. Caster groups generally prefer the druid HP/AC buffs because of the mana regen portion, so use a group symbol buff on them or individually hit them with symbol of Naltron/Marzin if you dont have Naltron Mark. <br />
<br />
Usually, there will be a druid on hand to cast Circle of Seasons group resist buffs. This is a good thing. An even better thing is if you can get the cleric resist fire and resist cold buffs up on your group prior to them casting their circle buff. Circle of Seasons will stack on top of the cleric resist cold and fire, BUT if your group has CoS already, your resist fire buff will not stick. Your resist cold spell can be cast after all other resist buffs are cast since I have not had a problem with it sticking after CoS has been cast.<br />
<br />
Pull time:<br />
<br />
Target the puller and cast celestial elixir on them just prior to them going out. Keep them targeted and your finger on the remedy button. The puller should tell you immediately if they picked up two and you should hold off any additional heals unless the puller tells you they are succesfully FD down. If they got a single and are taking lots of damage on the pull, Remedy has a long cast range and can sometimes reach a puller in time saving him so the Call of Hero can pull him back up to safety. It will be very tempting to cast celestial elixir or complete heal on the puller once he is back up to you safely, BUT don't do it if you are healing the main tank as well and the mob is INC. You do NOT have enough cast time for the puller and will be to slow starting your complete heal on the main tank. Your primary focus should be the little red slidey HP bar for your main tank. Just throw a celestial heal on your puller as soon as your first complete heal hits your tank and patch them up as you are able.<br />
<br />
Mob INC! (for MT Cleric):<br />
<br />
OK It is party time! Main tank tags the bad guy and pulls him up. Stay hidden in your little nook against the wall and stare at MT HP bar. It is always good to know how many total HP your tank has so you can adjust your heals accordingly. Usually the main tank will have 5Kish HP and is what I base most of my %life before heal on. Pay close attention to how fast your tanks HP bar is going down. If it is dropping like a rock, start your complete heal at about 70% life. If it is dropping slowly, start it at 50% life. It is tempting to wait longer, but until the shammies or chanters get this thing slowed, it can do a lot of damage in a surprisingly short time. If you see that you will need a little back up, ask for a fast heal on %t in the raid channel or healer channel so the other healer types can supplement you.<br />
<br />
OK, so the main tank has the mob scooted around by the fire pot and you are standing against the wall staring at the MT little red HP bar. IF you see that the mob has been slowed, adjust your heals down a tad. You will see that you can wait until 50% to begin your complete heals. It is a tad dangerous to wait longer than this, but sometimes if you really want to be &quot;efficient&quot; you can give it a try /wink. MT will call engage and the rest of the melee types will romp out to meet their latest foe. Everyone will start taking some AE damage. Just watch everyone elses AE damage taken and don't become to alarmed. Remember that your main focus should be keeping the MT standing. When your group has dropped down a tad from AE damage just run out and stand next to the main tank and slip a group heal into the mix. I recommend doing this immediately after you top off the main tank, or if you have group complete heal, run out and use it to top everyone up! It is a freaking rush to heal 15,000 HP or more at one time!! Try not to let anyone in your group drop below one bubble though since the bad guy may turn on them to finish them off and then there are aggro issues for the MT to get control of again. <br />
<br />
Mob INC! (not MT cleric):<br />
<br />
Use /assist healing off of the mob. Watch the main tank HP and if it drops below one bubble of HP or if you don't think Complete Heal from the MT cleric will land in time, drop a remedy or divine light on the MT as insurance. Watch your groups hp bars as well. They will drop at varying rates depending on their level and resist so you will need to use your celestial series spells to keep them with some hp to counteract the AE. If they are all taking damage on a fairly consistent basis, go out and snuggle up to them and cast your group heal spells. Just be careful how close you get to the bad guy and observe max melee range to cast from since group heals generate healthy aggro. <br />
<br />
Remember though, your main responsibility is to back up the cleric in the MT group. Continually assist off the bad guy onto the MT to see how their HP bar is looking. If the MT falls, it is bad, very bad. Immediately /assist off of the mob if the MT drops. Get ready to spam your remedy spells depending on who the mob is going after. Let's hope the back up tank can gain some aggro quickly. If the back-up tank is in your group, start a complete heal on them and call for fast heals on them to supplement when they starts taking damage if you see it will not be fast enough. Don't panic. Just try to keep the person getting beaten on alive (by using /assist Bad_Guy) and we will be able to survive.<br />
<br />
After the fight:<br />
<br />
Kick back and lick your wounds. Top your people back off with HP and med back up. Rez or Rebuff anyone that might have died. <br />
<br />
General things to remember:<br />
<br />
1. Always stand when there is a pull incoming.<br />
2. Hug the wall on the side that the pull is incoming to avoid AE.<br />
3. Do NOT drag corpses unless you can FD or know exactly where it is safe to drag. <br />
4. NEVER open the door when there is a mob incoming.<br />
5. Wear as much resist gear as you can to counter the AE.<br />
<br />
<br />
Clerics should always remember that we are not just individual clerics healing our own groups. We are a healing TEAM. Use /assist to bounce around and see who is attacking who and use your heals to supplement your other clerics as needed. Keep a solid situational awareness so you will know before something happens what to expect and how you should react to it. Know that sometimes you will be required to make really crappy decisions about who lives and who dies. It happens as part of a clerics life and no one will get down on you if they die. Just try to remain focused and keep the majority of our people with their pointy ends up and we will be fine. When all else fails and you know it is going to be a wipe, hit DA, sit down, load gate, back into a corner and pray you can channel! You did remember to rebind out front of ToV right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully some of you can critique this little guide I put together for my guild clerics.  I do not have a lot of HoT experience, but I do have more than the other clerics in my guild.  If any of you see any glaring ommissions, please let me know so I can edit my guild post to reflect the changes.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juukii</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have enough experience in HoT, but I'd still advise not using Remedy too often, even on casters. In HoT, I'd assume PC casters would have at least 2.5k HPs. Remedy heals for roughly 450HPs? that's less than 1 bubble of health. No point healing for that much. Get a mage to summon haste items for casters  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif very useful items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSmiter</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah screw remedy. I haven't memmed that spell in a LONG time. <br />
<br />
The best bet for casters is to cast Cel Heal/Elixer as soon as they start taking damage and then figure out what to do next based on how things are progressing. If you cast it at 2500 hpts, the spells do 900/1500 healing and gives you time to either divine light, or CH them depending on how much they're getting beat on. Simple fact is that if you can't get the mob off them in the time it takes a celestial spell to run its corse you're screwed anyway, or you'd be oom trying to chain remedy heal them.<br />
<br />
Resist gear is not all that important to clerics. Wear your best mana gear instead and just use the walls to shield you from AEs. I've been through the entire HoT area just about, and there are very few places that you can't use physical structures to shield you from AEs. If you're getting hit by AEs, MOVE. You don't need line of sight to heal, so just keep using group select to target your groups tank, and the assist off him to target the mob, then assist heal whoever the mob is attacking. SIMPLE.<br />
<br />
Only exception to the resist gear rule is the MT CHer. Not sure if HoT summons, I've always been group healer for the most part, but if they do, you would do well to have reist gear to help suck up some of the AEs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zardnok</div><div class="date">07-31-2002, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing that I use remedy for in HoT is the long distance heal to save the puller if he is about to die on his way back in with a mob.  Sometimes they will get stunned and smacked about pretty hard and that 450HP is just enough to keep him alive long enough for the call of hero to snatch him up to safety or for the MT to tag the mob.<br />
<br />
Normally, I use Celestial Elixir on casters during an AE situation to counteract the effects of spells.  If they gain aggro, they are pretty much toast anyway.<br />
<br />
Is there a spell you think I should keep loaded instead of Remedy?  Or maybe a spell that I do not have loaded that you think I should?  Keep in mind this is a purely situational set-up that I use only for HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dez</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">couple things on HoT. my guild doesn't really go there, or farm west side armor all that much lately, but here's some things to think about.<br />
<br />
remedy IS needed and/or usefull on these raids. as mentioned above, its great for the long distance heal when your tank's running back to the group but isn't going to make it in range of a c heal. sometimes i used to go follow the tank, and spam him w/ remedys' on the way back. especially if he pulls more than one mob. if you get summoned just pop a DA and run back into taunt radius and you're all set.<br />
<br />
the other use of remedy : to heal yourself and other clerics / casters that are almost to 40% hps. at 40% or less HoT, west side tov and EoS, ikitiar etc will summon people and kill them. i use remedy if i see another cleric about to be @ summoning levels, and i dont have the 3 secs for elixer to start working, nor the 7 for DL to cast (including lag hehe)..<br />
<br />
other than that, most things posted are pretty right on. i dont worry about resists much, cuz at level 60 , and with the walls in tov you can pretty much stay out of AE , or resist a great deal of them. i go full hps/mana gear for these raids. if i notice myself getting worked by ae i just put a froggy crown on and maybe a lodi shield on my back  http://www.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
have fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">08-02-2002, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Lineup:<br />
Remedy<br />
Divine Light (dont use too often)<br />
Complete Heal<br />
Reviviscience<br />
Celestial Elixir<br />
Divine Aura<br />
Divine Barrier<br />
Reckoning<br />
<br />
I keep Rev up as I am not getting my epic and at present no cleric in BH has their epic (and I dont consider it necessary for HoT, or anywhere, anyway).  I dont combat res too often, but after many raids its just easier to keep Rev up.<br />
<br />
The nuke is for those pesky gaters, and as I am a uncharismatic dwarf I cant seem to land a stun (to push back not actually stun) to save my life.<br />
<br />
I always keep Remedy up.  It's range and quick casting time make it the only choice for casters. Sure Elixir and Divine Light heal more, but they take a lot more time.  And time is something a thin-skinned caster does not have.  Plus, as mentioned above, supplemental heals whilst the MT is being CH'd are very important, lest that mean ol' mob quad unexpectedly and cause your poor tank to drop from under the CH.<br />
<br />
A very handy class to have in HoT or anywhere is a Paladin.  Healing Wave of Prexus, though quite high in mana cost, keeps me from having to waste mana on our inefficient group heal.  Also, the pally's Lay Hands can be a real lifesaver should that CH be a little off (or fizzle).  Our pally's are frequently our MT's, and as unorthodox as this sounds it is (in many ways) a better setup.  Lay Hands, self heals, and Healing Wave can help a pally keep agro when some of our warriors cant.  I still prefer a nice, solid meatbag of a warrior but a competent paladin can perform the meatbag job pretty dam well.<br />
<br />
With the advent of raid channels we now have our raid healer channel, which makes things a little easier.  The clerics, druid/shaman support healers, and enchanters (a well-timed Rune can really help out) are all there working to keep that MT alive and fighting.  It takes all of them working together, so we dont waste too much mana and have to wait for something to pop and waste valuable raid time.<br />
<br />
Its a team effort in HoT.  The whole raid really has to work together and understand each part of the puzzle to make things go smoothly.  The three biggest things I have found to keep the MT alive are:<br />
1.Timely CH<br />
2.Timely support heals<br />
3.Good communication when things 1 &amp; 2 fail<br />
<br />
Its not easy, and we die very badly from time to time, but its a lot of fun to get through a night of HoT and watch the armor roll on in.<br />

You 100% sure Ikitiar low health aggros I know the last time I fought him and Im pretty sure I have screenshots laying around somewhere I went below 40% health a few times from over enthusatic mod clicking and didnt get low health aggro/summon not once ~<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 03:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Divine light.  I finally swapped out remedy for good when I realized if I were going to use it chances were the it wasn't going to heal enough to keep anyone alive.  Then I'd have to cast again and again.  I'd get aggro'd on from chain casting and die then everyone dies.<br />
<br />
My thought is if divine light isn't fast enough, then you're probably better off with the person just dying and you surviving to possibly heal the next tank/enchanter/whathaveyou.<br />
<br />
However, I usually two-box my druid and she'll cast a chlorobast the same time I do a DL if things look critical.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maribella</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remedy ... rarely use it in HoT.  Only time I can really think of is a last ditch effort to save an almost dead MT .. when you know other clerics are casting DL and CH.<br />
<br />
Younger characters (55, 56ish) really really need to have their resists up high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davef139</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres what i keep up for HoT this is what iuse for 1 group farmage. <br />
CE: nver really use unnless we pull a rare<br />
CH:<br />
Judgement: hoho gotta keep stuff dead!<br />
Group CH:<br />
Divine INtervention<br />
Dinvie Light<br />
DA<br />
DB<br />
<br />
This is done with either this group setup:<br />
monk, clr, enc, sham, 2 rog<br />
or  monk, clr, sham, war, rog <br />
But this is also done with ppl with good gear i once made a rog tank a HoT rare!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My experience with Death Pact was basically a waste of a stack of pearls and with Divine Intervention being touted as an &quot;upgrade&quot; with a more expensive component, I filed it away at the back of my spell book.<br />
<br />
Does it work sufficiently often to actually make a difference?  It may be a spell that I work into my reportoire to keep on my main tank and puller if I thought it would actually help out and not just be a waste of a gem.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't help all that much in a normal raid. Doesn't last nearly long enough for common mobs.</div></div><hr />
