<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bico</div><div class="date">11-06-1999, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would (amost) give up all my other wishes if Verant would extend cleric buff durations equal to other characters. Shaman friend cast Talisman on me the other night. I casted Symbol on myself 3 times before his Talisman ended. And we have to pay plat for our spells. Seems most spells cast on me by others last much longer than our Cleric buffs. I keep asking myself, why would Verant care if Cleric buffs lasted shorter, same, or longer? I see no reason except to keep us busy medding longer. Symbol of Nalron costs me 13 plat. Now you would think for that kind of money the spell should last all day.!!!!<br />

Maybe we are all never going to be satisfied with our characters regardless but I still feel Verant or Brad has at least an uncocious dislike of clerics. Maybe when younger he was playing AD&amp;D and a cleric did something to his character that he said &quot;I will get even&quot; about ?  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
