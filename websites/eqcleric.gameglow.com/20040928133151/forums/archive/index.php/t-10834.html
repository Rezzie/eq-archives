<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasren</div><div class="date">05-04-2001, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been hunting in ToV for the past couple weeks putting in about 70 hours so far. My question is what types of drop rates and types are you seeing?<br />
<br />
My experience is so far for drops is an average of 2 an hour. Somedays it seems to be better and somedays it seems to be worse. The rate of the type of armor drops seems to vary greatly among each type and very streaky (one day almost all silk, another maybe chain).<br />
<br />
In order of Common to rare it seems to be Silk, Chain, leather then a very distant back Plate. We have begun to have silk pieces now being grabbed for alts incase they can be multi-quested and 3 of the chain classes down to just a few final pieces (oddly enough they all have the BP). While some of the plate classes haven't even received one drop yet.<br />
<br />
Plate - CLR, WAR, PAL, SHD, BRD<br />
Chain - ROG, SHM, RNG<br />
Leather - DRU, MNK<br />
Silk - MAG, WIZ, NEC, ENC<br />
<br />
I was curious as to what your experience of the drops might be. If it does seem like Plate is rare hopefully we can see if the drop rates can be increased for plate. It is getting discouraging spending 5 hours a night past the no drop mobs and not see a single plate piece drop.</div></div><hr />

Silk is much less common and plate seems to be downright rare. We've only gotten 2 BPs tho, one plate and one chain.<br />
<br />
I have heard that some clearings have produced mass quantities of plate but I haven't seen it yet. Maybe after this weekend I can report some happy news...<br />

The 4 types of armor all drop evenly.  Sometimes its a silk night, sometimes its a plate night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">05-04-2001, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now:<br />
56 plate drops. (26 people active)<br />
28 leather. (7 active)<br />
29 silk. (18 active)<br />
50 chain. (12 active)<br />
<br />
In general all numbers are a bit low due to incomplete reports from raids.<br />
<br />
Leather is definately too low, we don't have many leather wearers (only two classes), and we've got several spares. Same with chain.<br />
<br />
All in all, our druids are pretty much completely decked out (the monks don't like it as much, they have what they want though).<br />
Rangers and the most active rogues and shamans are almost complete. Only three plate wearers have more than four pieces sofar.<br />
<br />
The first week we got several chain, leather and silk chest pieces but no plate bp, now we've gotten three, at least.</div></div><hr />

We fight in the west wing and also clear the renter room several times. In 4 raids we've gotten jack $hit for plate drops. 50% has been leather (nearly all rots now), 30% chain, 15% silk, and 5% plate :P.<br />
This is WAY out of balance and is very frustrating considering that:<br />
1. Most non-plate TOV armor sux<br />
2. 70% of the people in attendance have been sharing 5% of the drops<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calac Oakshield</div><div class="date">05-07-2001, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we spent 2 days there 8 hours each and got 5 chain BPs. Several other chain peices. A few silk. 1-2 leather. 3 plate. all in all it was Temple of Chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">05-07-2001, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, just to skew things a bit, I and the people I do ToV with are +dragon so we are fighting in the test halls while other people are fighting the mobs you are fighting.  In general, when I've been there when there's been both +giant and +dragon raids in progress, I would say that the drop rates for +giant seems a bit higher then +dragon.  I'm not sure if this is because they are killing more mobs faster or just fluke or what, but it can be frustrating while the mobs we are fighting aren't droping $%$@$#@!.  I watched several plate bits announce but since it wasn't my raid I wasn't paying very close attention.<br />
<br />
But in the 4 raids in the testing halls I've kept track, the highest dropped armor has been plate, followed by leather, then chain then silk.  Our poor casters are frustrated.  Plate is leading, but not by a lot, and I think the amount of leather we have gotten is absurd since only 2 classes can use it.  I personally feel that plate should drop the most since used by 5 classes, then silk (4), then chain (3), then leather (2).  <br />
<br />
Worst plate day was 2 clearings of the testing halls and only got 1 out of 14 drops (but it was a bp).  Best day for plate was 2 clearings of the testing halls and we got 7 (or 8) plate drops, out of 17/18 total drops and 2 bps, 1 legs (The main warrior and myself ended up with the bp's and I must admit, I look pretty spiffy in my blueish bp *grin*).<br />
<br />
The 4 raids have cleared the halls 2 times and the # of drops has been 11,14,15, and 17/18 (can't remember).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasren</div><div class="date">05-07-2001, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All this talk made me go back and go over the numbers. I was slightly wrong in what I had for results.<br />
<br />
Plate - 17 pieces (17 active people)<br />
Leather - 16 pieces (9 active people)<br />
Chain - 33 pieces (8 active people)<br />
Silk - 31 pieces (6 active people)<br />
<br />
So silk in chain has been a major drop for us with leather and plate a rarer drop. I will agree that I have seen streaks in the armor drops so maybe we just need to hit that elusive Plate and leather drop day.<br />
<br />
We are back in there for another 3 days this week so I will update this again next week<br />

It's not completely up to date at all times, and it doesn't include some invited people, nor some retired people.</div></div><hr />
