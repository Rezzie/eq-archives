</FONT><HR>I looked at the lovely little patch message today... then I saw this:<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal remains. Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only be dropping items for those epic quests.

Guilds are fighting every 90 hours for this spawn.

</FONT><HR>That won't be happening any time soon.<P>By making Ragefire a limited spawn, they can control how much xp is being restored to people.<P>Imagine all the people that are under 55 and working towards their epics so that they can have the 56 res.<P>If the spawns are severly limited, then they reduce the number of people that can actually give the 56 res.  Less xp back during resses, means more playing time which means more income for Verant.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>That would be all well and good except that the 56 rez isn't really all that better than the 49 one so the difference in xp restored is marginal. And I would figure people would play longer if their raids were more raiding less ressing. So they're not really advancing the play longer angle by doing this... in fact some people might play less if they figure they'll never have a shot at the epic because of Ragefire issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Yes, but can you understand how we are being abused and ignored in this situation here? I mean, other classes get to spawn their own mobs... we don't.<P>Verant knows we are the class that makes raiding successful... and they hate it when we can kill their precious little uber mobs.

</FONT><HR>Also left out an important remark.<P>The downtime associated with the "clicker" is almost non existant.<P>This last weekend we did a raid on POA.  35 people or abouts on Island 6.  Total wipeout on a bad pull.  We had 1 necro that had a life gem that was camped out.  He dragged me and a enchanter to a safe spot and ressed me.<P>I came back, grabbed my clicker, ressed the enchanter and then looted the rest of my gear.  As soon as the enchanter was ressed and looted, he invised us and we wait for the necro to cast his invunerability spell and drag the mobs away from the camp site.  <P>After he dragged the bees away from the bodies, the enchanter and I ran over to the site and within 15 mins, everybody was back and had looted their bodies.<P>Pre clicker, this would have taken probably 1 hour or more.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Im beginning to think the way the epic weapons have played out it isnt really a good thing.<P><BR>Originally, they were to be held by a minority of the population.  However, some quests are far easier than others. Cleric, Rogue, and now Druid with a triggered Fay are quite simple in my opinion.<P>I really think these weapons should be held by a minority of players. VI once said that these are not intended for "Casual gamers" yet, barring rage, and with support from your a guild or say 5 groups of people, one could possibly complete the cleric epic...in a day.<P>I agree, Rage is a problem, but it is a "fix" in a roundabout way..and rather fitting.  The cleric role is often spent on his/her bum "Waiting" to heal......ironic that the most difficult part of our epic is now "waiting" for a NPC to spawn.<P>-hav<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><BR>The fact Verant expected a minority of players to get these, show's how shortsighted they were about them.<P>Once a group of people figure out how to kill "some_mob" then it will be taken down repeatedly.  Most servers have several "uber guilds" who might "farm" (I use the term somewhat seriously, somewhat loosly here) these epics, plus several "not so uber" guilds that can band together and kill said mobs.<P>Even if it means every cleric out there gets a Sprinkler, I think our quest is a fairly nice quest... and it ramps up nicely.  But then in the "endgame" of our quest, they firk it up royally.<P>There's Burglebutt and Gimblebum which you can solo if you choose, or get a couple friends to just help out.  Then the priest, which does not require a huge force, but its a "mini raid"... then you get BBQ Boy which is a decent sized fight... then you get a nice ramp up to the Chardok raid... and then what?  Camp/Fight/Bitch/KS over Ragefire, and have tons of clerics waiting on him.  I don't get it.<P>The idea for "hard quest" for some classes, was rare spawns and rare drops... like the Peggy Cloak, or Cazic Skin... that stuff is insane... even worse than Ragefire in the sense that at least 1 cleric epic enters the world per week... did not used to be that way on a cazic skin.<P>Our quest is nice, forces you to get some friends, and we take it up the ass on Ragefire.  I see no reason not to let us have it if you can get the people and complete the quest.  More sprinklers in the world?  News Flash!  There's a ton of them out there already, and clerics already get the effect at 56... sure manaless res is FANTASTIC... but it's not like clerics with epics get some super new unbalanceing effect... it helps reduce downtime... Verant already made sure that 51-60 was going to take a long time, I don't understand why they are against saving a couple hours on a raid.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>More time = more money<P>True, until there is some more valid competition in the market.  I'm not saying EQ's gonna die... I'm saying, if there's EQ, Game A, Game B, and Game C... all quality games in thier own right, players are going to choose REALLY what gives them "Risk vs Reward" (Princess Bride Flashback... I don't think that word  means what you think it does") AND what gives them "Time vs Reward".<P>I personally think EQ fails Risk vs Reward... and somewhat fails "Time vs Reward".<P>One common theme in new MMORPG's seems to be "dynamic quests" such that people don't fight over the same spawns and stuff... this appears to be a super idea right there... I don't *KNOW* that it's gonna work... and just because you are both after different 10 hour, rare spawn mobs, doesn't make the quest faster or easier... but I think there is great potential - just as an example.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The degree of the encounters dictated the need for the res stick.

Why? Druids by nature are soloists who can collect a majority of the needed items with their secondary class skill, farming an sales. Clerics on the other hand are not soloist, they are a support class who is usually not the richest, and whose epic items cannot be bought.<P>To ease the path for druids and rangers whose only bottleneck has been these 2 spawns is negligence simple an true.<P>I want Rage to be a long camp. I want to have value to the items I attain. I take pride in the fact 90% of my personal gear is no drop. If farmers can buy nearly all their epic and it makes them feal good then so be it.<P>The value of a cleric with epic will always outweigh a druids or rangers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>"The value of a cleric with epic will always outweigh a druids or rangers."<P>I could not agree more...I like the idea that Ragefire is a long spawn...you have to realize that in making the spawn long on ragefire it makes obtaining the epic all the better, you actually worked for it...and I must say, the wait on ragefire on brell isn't all that bad really...nonetheless, I am enjoying doing my quest, I like that its not the hardest quest, and at the same time not the easiest, not like the shammy quest which is so dammed easy its funny, anyway, I don't think spawn rate on Venril Sathir should have been upped, but whatever, more power to the whiner droods I guess...<P>------------------<BR>Despised Lifespinner<BR>Celestial Rage<BR>NO HEAL FOR YOU!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

EQ is devolving into little more than a  "Lord of the Flies" scenerio.  Oh boy I get to see what humanity is like in some of it's ugliest forms while I enjoy my virtual world.  <P>If there was little competition for Ragefire, waiting for a spawn MIGHT be acceptable.  When guilds rush in to KS the spawn the second it arrives I say enough.  <P>For smaller guilds or those folks who have to get people to work cooperatively, a dragon level encounter at a moment's notice is next to impossible.  On mature servers the competition is insane.  <P>For Verant to intentionally create a situation like this and justify it as a mechanism for regulating the rate of clerics getting their quest item is unbelievable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Concerning the Ragefire in Skyfire... You're still looking at a case where it'd only have 32k hitpoints, not that hard to deal out if you have the right combination of classes.  Besides which, its an 'epic' battle, much better that the pathetic dragon which they allow us to spawn in Sol B.  And its pathetic because of the level cap not being on it, else you'd see a team of 6 doing Nagafen and vox every week.  The only thing 'epic' about the Ragefire spawn is the boring nature of camping it, as compared to the BW fight with Ixiblatt (thats fun!)<P>As for the VS spawn being upped, this was actually done because of the fact that he's a weeklong spawn, and most european guilds would always kill him the moment he was up (see Magna Charta on Sol Ro for example) thus creating a problem with the guilds that COULD kill him not being able to because he was so incredibly rare.  Ever notice how Trak is a 2 or 3 day spawn?  Now VS is a 3 day spawn.  Not that bad considering that they are both limited to 32k hitpoints and are relatively simple for the items that come off them.<P>Yes, it's still not amusing at all that druids and rangers got their quest nerfed so that they would be as common as rogue cleric monk and shamen epics (soon to be warrior epics with the commonality of the blades from the Queen, which used to be their cork in the bottle so to speak).  The epics should be rare, and there was talk that they would only come out of VP.  A lot of people I know think they should have stayed in VP had they done so, but I'm happy when I see my friends wielding the pinnacle weapon of their particular class, because they put a lot of hard work and effort into the quest/camp.<P>------------------<BR>Machia Soleo'Sano<BR>58th year Priestess of Paradigm<BR>Solusek Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Let's clarify a few things.  <P>The Ragefire camp is a solo camp if you have someone clearing fire giant every six hours or so.  In my one big attempt to camp him so far (54 hours) it took a lot of friends to keep them clear.<P>The Ragfire camp is a camp that is not only interrupted, but effectively ended every time the server goes down and Naggy respawns.<P>The Ragefire camp as it exists now clearly gives the advantage on the cleric epic to people who are free to play EQ at least 72 hours straight, usually beginning on a weekday, i.e. don't have Monday through Friday jobs.  This is not a whine, this is an observation.<P>About the only other epic with this kind of constraint was the VS epic, where the advantage went to people who could be on line when patch was over.  This may have changed now.<P>I still hope to get my epic sometime, and when I do I will carry it proudly.  And I don't begrudge it to everyone who already has it.  But those who say they favor a long camp for a random spawn should be realistic about the fact that they are what they are also saying is that they favor a camp that gives them an advantage over the so-called casual player.<P>I don't blame them, I would probably feel the same way.  <P>Let's face it. The people who really dserve the honor for the cleric epic are those paved the way, who found the path, and developed the tactics we all use now. <P>/salute to all of you.

</FONT><HR>Just my 2cps worth here.. First off I believe the epic quest is difficult enough as it is.. Anyone who says they can finish it in a day must have extremely good luck in the fact the first two spawns are somewhat rare in their appearance, although easy to take out.. Secondly, if getting thru the first three somewhat easy steps on day one is completed, fighting Ixblat, and the Overlord King in Chardock is no cakewalk.  Sure the uber guilds could do it.., but I would think even they would have to take some time to get thru these two steps.. and lastly Zordak, although easy in terms of dragons, is again a sit and wait type camp.  So in the difficulty degree I think our epic is fair. Not to hard.. not to easy.  <BR>The only things I would have changed are this.  First off make the rez effect not available until the weilder is of the same level as the spell. ( 56 ).. This would help enhance the higher level clerics to get their chance at Zordak first.  Admittedly there would still be those that would have the epic 6 levels below when they could use it and keep some hard working cleric out of Zordak, but at least it may put a degree of usefullness into the quest.  Secondly, I think the way the camp for Zordak is set up could be improved somewhat.  The server crashing for one is really a pain that is undeserved for someone that has been working at his epic, although that can be said for anyone who is in a plane or fighting their way to their mob too.   My only way of making the camp somewhat fair would be to make it necessary for a schedule to be put up for a cleric's attempt at Zordak.  Since ths spawn is somewhat random, then the schedule would be luck of the draw, but at least a cleric would know that he wouldn't get his camp stolen out from under him-which would really really tick me off.  I know this is not the best solution, but the only one that seems the most fair given the spawn rate as it now stands.   <BR>I was very lucky in my last epic fight, as Nagy was killed the night before .. and our guild had fire giants scheduled the following day on our server calendar.. and lo and behold Zordak spawned while we cleared em out.  I honestly did not think I would ever get my epic, as I belong to a small guild, but it was a very SWEET thing when I did.  Hang in there guys.. <P>Dusklar 59th cleric pushing 60 <BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Tons and tons I should imagine. How many Naggy raids get completely wiped out these days? Not very many at all. Why? Because we as a population *know how* to kill Naggy.<P>Same thing with let's say Trakanon. Uberguild puts in the time and the deaths to learn how it works. Once that investment is paid, you have the answer, and Trak drops pretty much every time.<P>Same with VP. I do personally remember the time when the 'unkillable' Phara Dar was first dropped. It wasn't that long ago. I imagine AL (it was AL, wasn't it?) took a fair few deaths before dropping her for the first time. And now? It's pretty much expected that if you're one of the top 2 or 3 guilds on your server, you can clear VP.<P>Same with Dain. AL seem to drop him every week nowadays.<P>My point? With things the way they are in the EQ universe, the only way to regulate the rate of items flowing into the game is to regulate the spawn time of the mob that drops them.

The main reason to have one is to make CR faster.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>As for the VS spawn being upped, this was actually done because of the fact that he's a weeklong spawn, and most european guilds would always kill him the moment he was up (see Magna Charta on Sol Ro for example) thus creating a problem with the guilds that COULD kill him not being able to because he was so incredibly rare. Ever notice how Trak is a 2 or 3 day spawn? Now VS is a 3 day spawn. Not that bad considering that they are both limited to 32k hitpoints and are relatively simple for the items that come off them.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>The nature of the change was this... large guilds want the Kunark legs off VS. Heck, Cobolt and Tolan's greaves are still hot commodities. But that also meant they got all the stones too. Meaning if you wanted to finish your epic, you could join a big guild or cough up upwards of 100k for a stone.<P>To solve this bottleneck for 2 classes, they separated the two. VS himself no longer drops stones (tho he still drops other epic items. go fig). Sometime between 1 and 3 days afterwards, a mob named Venril Sathir's remains will spawn and you do a little mini quest and it spawns a live VS who attackes you. He doesn't have the insane 1400HP lifetap and he drops the 2 stones. Thus, the big guilds still get legs but now it's easier for everyone to get stones. And more frequent as well.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Before anyone demands to know why a ranger is intruding on the cleric board, I'd like to point out that I've a level 20 cleric that I am now dedicated to playing to the end game and am here reading these forums to learn how to play the healer side of the game more efficiently.  Now, channeling the ranger:<P>Heh, "rangers have it easy" for Epic Quests.  Excuse me a sec while Kohpry rolls on the floor laughing here...   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>If we're favored, Verant has a funny way of showing it. Like:<P>1) A (potentially) nice, long wait in Greater Faydark killing greenie place-holders to get a rare NPC to spawn so you can hand her a note.<P>2) A mob in EK that must be engaged and killed in under a minute from the time it spawns, or it despawn on you.  Also, it's a good idea to kill his buddies, or they'll kill the NPCs you're supposed to hand the book you loot to.  I've heard rumors that respawn time on the triggers taking several hours when the dark elves kill them.<P>3) Four rare foraged items which-- unless you're incredibly lucky-- take HOURS to obtain for just ONE item.  I've heard horror stories of people spending as much as 24 hours in a zone trying to forage just one item.  These foraged items, btw are No Drop, so they can't be bought from others.<P>4) For enchanted clay, a NPC wants a Jade Reaver.  Jade Reavers are a rare drop off of Dark Reavers, which are hard-hitting, almost (if not completely) MR mobs with lots of hit points in City of Mist-- a zone with... err... "creative pathing".  Been on 4 reaver raids so far, I haven't seen one drop yet.<P>5) I have to compete with another class to get a stone off of Venril Sathir, who, until they changed his spawn time (and how the stones are dropped), was killed on my server (Povar) while I am at work, because that's when the server comes up after being patched.<P>---Here is where the ranger and druid quests part--<P>6) I have to adventure deep into the Hole to trigger and kill an NPC for a no drop hammer, an encounter that is really easy to mess up because the trigger and what the trigger spawns look identical.  I've taken a few dirt naps so clerics can camp because the main assist targeted Jaeil the Wretched instead of Jaeil the Insane.  Fortunately the rangers in question managed to loot their hammers before dying, so they did not have to re-do the quest through to the DEs in EK to obtain a new Shiny Tin Bowl.<P>7) I have to convince a bunch of people that they want to help me get to the 4th island in Plane of Air to obtain a no-drop sphere.  The only nice thing about this part is that it is a common drop.<P>8) I have to loot a Shattered Emerald of Corruption off of a boss mob in Hate (before they changed Hate, it was off of Inny himself, and gods didn't live all that much longer than VS when they spawned).  I've been up to Hate 5 times since the changes, and I haven't seen an emerald drop yet.<P>Plus there's an Innoruuk-awful amount of running around to far-flung places all over Kunark, Faydwer, Antonica, and Odus-- especially with the multiple steps in the Epic that I didn't list here.  You can read about the whole thing here:<BR> <A HREF="http://www.monsterweb.org/rangerfa" TARGET=_blank>http://www.monsterweb.org/rangerfa</A> <P>Please don't think I'm not sympathetic to the plight of higher-level clerics.  I've camped Begurgle with friends for at least 16 hours (be nice to your Enduring Breath Caster...), been primary tank for a few Plasmotic Priest raids (ouch!), participated in several Ixiblat Fer gankings (including a marathon where we triggered 15 of him in a row), helped slay in the King in Chardok, and helped hold the camp and slay Ragefire in SolB for a cleric in an allied guild.  But to say rangers have an easy time obtaining the Epics is FAR from true.<P>/wonders where her Swiftwind and Earthcaller are.<P><BR>--Ahadi Utundu, Cleric of the 20th Prank<BR>--Aquilo Phoenix, Povar<BR>--May mirth and Bristlebane's blessing follow you!<P>AKA<P>--Kohpry Mossarrow, 55th Season Outrider<BR>--Aquilo Phoenix, Povar<BR>--Tentanda Via!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>I, playing a shadowknight these days, don't even intend to start my epic. Why? Because I feel that epics should belong to those who don't mind spending day long camps and going through an insane amount of work to get this item. I don't feel jealous of these people because I have a nice job and a social life instead. These epics are no big deal. I'll probably draw some flames now, but as far as I'm concerned, they are just status symbols, especially the melee epics. I agree that the cleric epic is nice, but epics are by all means no "rights" for anyone to have.

</FONT><HR>Agreed Boan.<P>We completed 4 ranger epics this last weekend.<P>Killed the remains of Venril 3 times.  4 rangers and 2 druids got the stones.<P>As a side note, losing a battle to Ragefire really sucks.  Friday night 4 of us were camping in Naggy's lair.  me, 58 shaman, 54 monk and 54 druid.  The FG's were staggered and we were able to take them all out.<P>Spent half of the night chasing the FG's and the other half of the night killing LDC's and whatnot.<P>Around 2:30 am CST I logged.  Ragefire spawned about 3:00 am CST.  The monk (who's cleric was waiting for Ragefire) did a /GU Ragefire is up.  Everybody that was online (aproximately 4 groups) mustered as quickly as they could - forgoing the bank stop to pick up resist gear - they engaged Ragefire.<P>Ragefire was down to the "O" when the last person died.  They didn't have anybody that could res them quickly so Ragefire despawned.<P>Talk about a really crappy experience.<P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006039&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006039&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
