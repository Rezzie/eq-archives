The only thing I can guess is that he had won the best of the best for the server and had been moved to test for the finals there.  That's my only guess on how and why it happened.  Btw it wasn't just his skyshrine faction, he had all his factions reset to a newbie level.<br />

Some speculation that it somehow happened due to doing the faction quest between SS and WL (forgot the specifics, but something with pulling a PoG pricess or something to SS and keep hailing her while you zone back and forth).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can be run over and over.  Is this how some people were doing it- running her to the zone and then hailing her there?<br />
<br />
Boy- that would be bad, to be doing this to improve your CoV faction and suddently have it reset.<br />

<br />
There are people in my guild that at one point in time were KOS to a certain faction.  After a while of working to fix it they got to be warmly with that faction.<br />
<br />
Then after a period of time of continuely doing what they were doing, they rolled (or reset or something) their faction and are back to KOS with that particular group.<br />

Obviously a few flaws in the system still.<br />
