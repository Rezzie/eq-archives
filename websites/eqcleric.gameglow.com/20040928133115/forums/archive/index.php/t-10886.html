<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iphigenia</div><div class="date">08-18-2001, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has not quite enough level 60's to be able to do the uber mobs yet, in Velious.  But they're getting a little bored waiting for the rest of us to catch up to them. <br />
<br />
What ideas do you have for 1, 2 or 3 groups of level 60's to keep themselves entertained?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viscera</div><div class="date">08-18-2001, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am pretty much in the same boat as you, but moreso since I usually dislike 3-4 group raids. I'll do them, but I absolutely prefer testing the limits of one group.<br />
<br />
So, will mention what we do (average level, 59 or so)...<br />
<br />
Dragon Necropolis (not much anymore though)<br />
Siren's Grotto - tower (have killed the L61 and the L63+ named with one group)<br />
Siren's Grotto  - Well (good for BP gems)<br />
Velketor's Labyrinth - spider/lower dog area, Broodmaster area (before they &quot;nerfed&quot; the zone, still do it now though)<br />
Icewell Keep - caverns, fighting to the exit<br />
<br />
Other stuff we have done, but not recently...<br />
<br />
Kael Drakkel - arena for armor drops<br />
Sebilis - Protector/Jumpy area<br />
Howling Stones - Drusella Sathir<br />
Fear/Hate - experience (yeah, weird, I know)<br />
Sky - first isle (course, any 50+ group can do that)<br />

Expect a hard but fun fight. Depending on your faction deep Skyshrine can also bring some good fights for a limited number of people.<br />

<br />
Deep Chardok is fun, kill Korocust along the way.<br />
1 group gem farming in Hate.<br />
Dragons in Western Wastes are a blast.<br />

This is pretty easily done with a 6-person group of 60s?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HonoriaGrace</div><div class="date">08-21-2001, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very easy.  Just get a good monk puller, coth mage and the rest is golden.  You have no worries as long as you watch the second floor aggro and camp as soon as you take a harm touch.  Pull the caster corner and avoid the spite golems.  It's very easy.  You just have to be smart about it.<br />
<br />
Now, if only the would let me actually pull Hate some time...<br />

<br />
Sirens Grotto is alot of fun exploring and killing, as is Kael Drakkal imho.<br />
<br />
VL slowly becomes crowded just like Karnor or Sebilis, and I hate that.<br />
Charasis is quite cool, but many mobs are green to level 60´s.<br />
Chardok... I hate Chardok. No further comment.<br />
<br />
Maybe the level 60´s should start a second char and go to Sol B, Guk, VL and stuff  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">08-21-2001, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gem farming in Hate usually occurs after some guild has gone in and cleared out all of the 12 hour spawns.<br />
<br />
We just go up and kill the roamers. They don't drop any armor, but they drop a whole lot of rare gems and sellables, including diamonds and blue diamonds.<br />
<br />
It's very easy with 1 group of 55+<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">08-23-2001, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back when RoK was still brand new, I went on a dungeon crawl of Chardok with 5 of my closest and most skilled friends. We fought top to bottom and had only one death. It's one of the coolest looking dungeons in the game once you get down past the Castle area.<br />
This would be a fun distraction for a couple groups of lvl 60.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, Halls of Testing is regularly done with 3-4 groups of lvl 60ish (if your guild is on COV faction).<br />
Sirens Grotto is kind of cool to explore.<br />
Dragon Necropolis is fun, and uber easy with 3-4 groups.<br />
They could kill Woushi, and polish up their dragon encounter skills, or pull the dragons in the TOV valley of Western Wastes(they drop some pretty decent talismans).<br />

We only had one level 60 person (a warrior) and a few level 59s though, and it's not really something you can do all the time.. but still a great encounter to get the blood pumping!<br />
