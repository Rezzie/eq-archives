Not even funny how fast you level here.  When you're 21-24 you should get about 3 or 4 partners to work with, since all dogs will be red or yellow.  Right now, i'm 26 and can solo it easily with a mage and his earth pet.  Probably be able to do it with just a monk or tank, since we heal and they smash.  No real need for nukers so any type of tanks work.  I joined a group once around 9 or 10 am and by 2:30 had gone from one bub to lvl 23 to lvl 25.  The one downside is that sometimes one or two dogs gets stuck somewhere, and that reduces the spawn time horribly.  Same goes with having to share with another group, but that normally happens when a high lvl guy can solo a dog once every4 or 5 spawns, so it doesn't matter too much.  The highest i've seen is 32 magician, lowest was a big group of 18-22 guys.  And what's great for me is that there is a ogre camp to the right to sell at (no loot from dogs but..) and a bandit camp to the left!! these are the ones that give faction good for qeynos and drop bronze weapons and the sashes (which turned in at qeynos gets a bronze weapon everytime). The ogre camp doesn't have very good prices, but it's so close it's normally worth it to sell off the bronze you find on bandits.  Even with the dogs having no loot, killing bandits when waiting for dogs gets really good loot and the dogs really good XP makes a great combination.  Also, its right by Rathe mountain zone, so if they get to be too much (the dogs =) you can zone.<br />

Are the DW Pets still good at, say , level 26?  Also- exactly where are they?  I have been to the bandit/ogre spot at the Lk rathe/rathe mtn zone, but I don't recall any dw gob nearby.  <br />
<br />
Also- are they like the ones in Oasis- where you need some sort of trick to &quot;start&quot; them?  We couldn't figure the trick out  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
