<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">02-24-2000, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was camping the ghoul magi with a ebay farmer last night (I didn't know he was an ebay farmer until later, but anyway), when a level 49 druid comes by. She had died and was trying to recover her corpse. A few minutes later she comes back with a train at her heals (a very small one, thank god) and dies at my feet. <br />
<br />
Since this was her second (maybe even third) death, I took pity and offered her a revive to get back down there. Healed and buffed her, invis to undead her twice so that she could retrieve her corpses.<br />
<br />
No offer of payment, not even a thank you. <br />
<br />
Then she sat down with the ebay farmer (level 49 nec, btw) and they had a chat about all the great equipment their twinks had (nec said he had a cleric with 237 wis) and what would be fair trades for the stockpiles of high level loot they had.<br />
<br />
I left shortly after that and went to the bedroom where I had a great time.<br />
