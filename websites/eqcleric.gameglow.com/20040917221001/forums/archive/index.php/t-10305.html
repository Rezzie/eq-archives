I want anyone who is able to read this to understand the full extent of the problems that have been ignored by customer service at Verrant Interactive. <br />
I play Everquest. I have an account which is prepaid for, and have met all of the agreements in the User Agreement as stated before entering the game. I have active characters on the Tholuxe Paells server, primary being a level 19 Cleric. <br />
Approximately one month ago a real life friend, we will call him John, asked me if I would make some characters on the Solusek Ro server in order to hold items for him. I DO NOT PLAY ON THIS SERVER. I created the characters on this server strictly for the purpose of holding items for my friend. I leveled these characters to a point in which they would not be in danger of being erased if Verrant and the people at Sony Station decided to do a level 1 character purge, therefore all of these characters are either level 2 or 3.  I made the trade with my friend and returned to my own server. This should be the end of the story.... <br />
On Wednesday, November 8th, 2000 at approximately 9:50pm, EST, I tried to log on to my account to find a message that said my &quot;account has been temporarily suspended due to inappropriate behaviour&quot; and that I was to contact Everquest Technical support. Needless to say, tech support is not available at this time. I called a few of my friends to see if they were having trouble and one of my friends said he was having the same problem, we will call him Joe...after discussing the matter we discovered he was also holding items for John.  Immediately Joe friend contacted John and asked what was going on...here is the story I was told: <br />
John asked us to hold on to items. After doing this decided to give away his account, which, yes we know, is against Verrant policy, but has nothing to do with us, it was his decision. After he gave away his account, he, for whatever reason, decided to call customer service and get the new password to look at the account again. Obviously the registration information did not match and so the account was put on suspension for investigation. Through this investigation, it was discovered that items were transfered to my account as well as Joe's, therefore they were put under suspension as well for suspicious activity. I did recieve an email from Jalane Crosby, GM Admin Azhra of Solusek Ro with a very general statement regarding this. here is the email I recieved: <br />
Hello,<br />
I am GM Azhra of Solusek Ro. I am contacting you in regards to your account<br />
(******). Your account has been suspended as per Verant policy for receiving<br />
items from a compromised account. All items involved in this will be<br />
returned to the rightful owner. <br />
You can contact eqaccountstatus@verant.com &lt;mailto:eqaccountstatus@verant.com&gt; for updates on the status of your<br />
everquest account.<br />
<br />
GM Admin Azhra of Solusek Ro<br />
Verant Interactive, Inc.<br />
JCrosby@verant.com &lt;mailto:JCrosby@verant.com&gt;<br />
Fine. I was extremely annoyed and upset that this had happened to my account. I immediately sent back emails to her to discover the reasoning behind it and this is the only other email I have recieved from her: <br />
Your account has been suspended for receiving items from a compromised<br />
account. The characters in question are:<br />
*******<br />
******<br />
*****<br />
Any further questions you have regarding this can be sent to<br />
eqaccountstatus@verant.com &lt;mailto:eqaccountstatus@verant.com&gt;<br />
GM Admin Azhra of Solusek Ro<br />
Verant Interactive, Inc.<br />
JCrosby@verant.com &lt;mailto:JCrosby@verant.com&gt;<br />
I again emailed asking for further details and have gotten no response. <br />
In order to resolve this, John called customer service first thing on Thursday November 9th, 2000 (at 8:30am PST) and explained the situation, that he no longer owned the account, knew about all transactions that happened to our accounts and was sorry for the inconvenience causing suspensions and requested that our accounts be reinstated since we were not part of any suspicious activity. He admitted he was fully aware of all items we had on our characters, and furthremore, excluded us from any and all events which disobeyed any policies as stated by Verrant in thier User Agreement. After several phone calls and being shuffled around from person to person, all of which told him they could do nothing to help, that he must speak directly with the person who placed the suspension, he was told on the phone that the accounts would be up and running that afternooon (Thursday November 9, 2000) by 2:30pm, PST. <br />
We waited a long time and our accounts were never reinstated. The original account in question however, John's, was reinstated and the new owner is able to play to his heart's content. My account and Joe's account remained inactive. Once the office had closed, Joe logged into the game with another account he owns and spoke with a GM who put him in touch with GM Admin Azhra, who put the suspensions on the accounts. This GM requested all emails we had recieved from anyone other than herself, of which there were none. Upon hearing this, she informed Joe that there was nothing she was willing to do to help us out. <br />
Friday morning, November 10, 2000, 8:30am PST, Joe calls back customer support and speaks with one David Mallet, the same person who lifted the suspension on the John's account, and asked what was going on. Again he was told the accounts would be active by the end of the day. He called back the office several times in the day to keep updated, only to be told they are working on it. <br />
<br />
At 4:00pm PST, Joe, feeling quite ignored, drove to the Verrant office to speak personally with someone about this. He was put in touch with a gentleman named John, a manager, who informed him that the paperwork was in his inbox since that morning but he hadn't gotten to it. At this point he called in a woman named Margie, handed her the paperwork and told her to lift the suspension on the one account and the ban placed on the other. Joe was told he was welcome to sit in the lobby and wait until this was resolved. Two hours later he asked to speak with John, and was told John had gone home for the day. He asked to speak with Margie, and someone went to look for her. They returned only to inform Joe that she had also left for home. Both people left, and Joe remained in the lobby for more than 2 hours without any updates, without answers, without anything. When he requested the number to the legal department, security was called and he was escorted out of the building. <br />
As of this writing, our accounts still are inactive. We now have to wait the weekend without being able to play. We have complied by all of the rules and regulations and have put up with a great deal of being shuffled around, ignored, treated like dirt and stepped on. If we have not broken any rules, how can they keep our accounts under suspension? I have thuroughly read over the user agreement and it states that there must be a breach in that contract in order for them to suspend or make an account inactive. We have not broken any rules, we bought the game, we paid for our accounts and we were given some items from a friend. And yet we are without accounts. We have had to fight tooth and nail with everyone we have come across in the so-called customer support department. We are customers but have recieved nothing close to support. <br />
There must be someone out there who has the ability to remove these suspensions. The suspension was lifted from the original, so-called comprimised account, so why not ours? This has been a very frustrating few days for us, and we want everyone to know of the lack of customer service, the lack of caring, the lack of professionalism, the lack of effort, the lack of business policies, the lack of customer support, and the lack of human decency portrayed by Verrant.<br />
And so I urge all of you out there who thought that maybe you were not doing anything wrong to take a stand against this kind of behaviour from Verrant.  I know there have been times when things have happened and each one of us have shaken our heads and said a little curse against Verrant but this time they have gone too far.  They have over stepped thier boundaries.  So, please, to avoid this happening to anyone else, please send in emails, feedbacks, petitions in game or anything else you can think of to let Verrant know we will not stand for this, or else you may be the next one to find out you have been suspended for trading items....<br />
I am posting this everywhere I can find in order to create as much awareness as possible and I will be checking back with each site to see if there are any ideas or comments that may help us out.  Thanks in advance for everything!</div></div><hr />
