<br />
The reason I ask is that the group of people I usually hunt with (not a large group) is currently allied with dwarves/dragons.  I am wondering if we would have the numbers/levels/classes/etc. to manage against the testing hall mobs for those working on their Skyshrine armor quests.<br />
<br />
We are primarily mid-fifties at this point with a few low- and a few high-fifties.  Only one or two 60s and low on tanks.  We work very well together, but I suspect there's more to it than just that.<br />
<br />
Is there a variety of old-world or Kunark mob that is comparable to the testing hall mobs or are they a whole new ballgame?<br />
<br />
I realize the easiest way to find this out is to go try it  =\.  But if I can make some smart faction decisions right now I would sure like to.  Thanks a ton.<br />
