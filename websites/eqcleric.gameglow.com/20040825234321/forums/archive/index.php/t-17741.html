We have a few clerics in training at the moment, but would like a few more. We are still a small, growing guild, buliding up our raiding pool slowly. We are currently short of clerics chanters and bards. We are not a strict high end raiding guild... we do not require attendance at every raid. We are just a group of people who like to have a good time, and would like to begin doing epics and smaller end raids. Please come and check out the guild web site:<br />
