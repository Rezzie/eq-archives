<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynet</div><div class="date">06-03-2000, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My protector, Willaena, was hunting in Mistmoore last night.  This was an experience grinding pick-up group in their mid 20s: ranger, rogue, necro, cleric, warrior.  Sixth person was shaman until he left, then a paladin.<br />
<br />
The cleric was, well, she was not playing her level 25 cleric in the manner in which I imagine that I will play when I hit level 25.  I think that is the most polite way to phrase it.<br />
<br />
Namely she was not keeping the puller (me) buffed, she was healing late in combat so that tanks were spending over a minute at 2 bubbles of health while fighting, and she did not appear to be casting aggressively on the casting dark elves.  Oh, and she went afk without telling us at least twice (including one time where we all moved from the hill to the graveyard and left her invisible on the hill thinking that she was with us.  She died when camoflage wore off.)<br />
<br />
I was group leader.  Perhaps I should have stopped pulling and had a little talk about roles, but I have gotten spoiled from grouping with good clerics.<br />
<br />
We were in the graveyard and were having terrible trouble with mobs healing themselves.  In part this was because all 3 tanks were small folks using 2-handers.  But it appears that our cleric did not have a single stun memmed because &quot;they resist too much&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Was I wrong to nag her to start stunning the casters?  She ws going oom from healing us as we killed the same mob again and again and again and again.<br />
<br />
Is there a good way to advise someone to play their class?  I don't like to get bitchey in group chat, but she was making me fairly nervous.  (I also nagged the paladin and warrior to dual wield and hot-key their shields out so they could swap and bash the casters)<br />
<br />
In her defense, after she woke up she was very good at keeping us healed during fights and I was pulling so fast that the limiting factor was the Ranger's mana ! <br />
<br />
Still, how to handle these situations in the future?<br />

Hmm, you say that after a while, she just suddenly switched the entire way she played?<br />
<br />
Sounds like more than one person is playing the account. I know several people that do this, and no matter how much they talk and how well they know each other, they WILL play differently.<br />

--------------------------------------<br />
At 24 we get GHeal,generally at that level tanks have to be down by 2+ bubbles for it not to waste mana.<br />
<br />

I assume you mean not casting stuns,it is only at these levels where you start learning about the effectiveness of stuns,but the mana-cost is still relatively high.<br />

Going AFK without notice is a problem with any class.<br />
<br />
The best way to give &quot;advice&quot; is to phrase it as a suggestion or a friendly request.If you start ranting,nagging and ordering people around they tend to get defensive and thus nothing gets changed<br />

It might have been 2 people on the account.  She might also just have been distracted.<br />
<br />
As for timing on the heals, I realize that you don't want to cast a 300 hp high-taunt heal on someone who is only down a little.  But I was getting a mite nervous fighting for extended periods of time with only 200 of my 750 hit points left.  At least at lower levels, this is where I would be tempted to refresh center/braver/daring during combat.<br />
<br />
Actually, I advised them to go sword and board.  If I had not been tired and sleepy at the time I probably would have asked them to prepare to swap shields in once the healing mobs hit half health.<br />
<br />
Heck, my Ranger currently carries a shield to hot-swap while pulling.  I though &quot;poor man's slam&quot; was a standard technique for small-race warriors.<br />
