Jest in case yew haven't heard.. shes a ~43 Gnome Mage that spawns every 6 minutes and has NO faction hits.  This rocks!  I didn't find out about it till I was late in 44, but I wish I had known about it earlier.  At 44 I was gettin' nearly one blue per two kills and at 45 I'm getting a solid blue every six kills.  That aint too bad.<br />
<br />
I've found she is easily dropped with the following:  Retribution, Force, Retribution.  If she has her pet up, it can be feared and will despawn after she is dead and the fear wears off.  Very effective technique and I thank whomever first suggested it here!<br />
<br />
I'll be well on my way into 46 tonight... (two yellows yesterday alone into 45)<br />
<br />
w00t!<br />

Just incase YOU weren't paying attention.  I went from 44 to 48 soloin' this chick in the matter of about a week.  Ok, I had to take time off to do a couple of Vox raids.. but the exp went so fast, I never really noticed.  I left immediately after dingin' 48 as I was almost SURE she would be light-blue at that point.<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  If yer inbetween 44-48, there is NO OTHER place faster to level.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if yer paying any attention Quotision, drool over my sig.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
