</FONT><HR>My guild has officially reduced my lvl 53 Cleric to the roll that can be filled by a druid or a shaman.  <P>1) I can't rez members of my guild in a raid when the lvl 56 clerics are around<BR>2) I can't buff members of my own group that i'm in charge of anymore.  I've learned that the lvl 60 cleric in my guild will now buff who he wants in any party in any guild raid with full approval of anyone around due to the magic bullet that can do one spell for 3 of my buffs.<P>I complain about how much this is reducing me to a shaman/druid that i am only just reduced to healing and nothing more and they say it's perfectly fine to do.  <P>My reply to this is simple.  They just lost a cleric for their raids.  I'll start playing my ranger on these raids.  If they ask for my cleric, i'll tell them, simply.  That job is being filled by the super clerics, let them heal more than one group or throw a shaman/druid into it.  I don't care anymore.<P>If anyone needs a rez in my guild?  Refer to super cleric.<P>Any thoughts?  Will this be the norm for any lvl 49 rezzing cleric out there?<P><P>------------------<BR><B>Ixcor Blackthorne</B> 54 Half-Elf PathFinder<BR><B>Ixcorian D'eltaire</B> 53 High Elf Vicar<BR><B>Ixcutus</B> 20 Erudite Wizard<BR><B>Ixcrutius</B> 17 Erudite Magician<P><B>Forgotten Alliance</B><BR><B>Bertoxxulous Server</B></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Welcome to the world of 49-55 clerics through Norrath.<P>I never performed a res on a raid until I reached 56, and still don't often, since I don't have my epic yet.  Buffs I typically do (Hero/Marzin/Bulwark) but sometimes a 58 cleric will come along and Naltron Mark my party.<P>I don't mind.<P>It's frustrating I know, getting passed over for 56 resses and such, but instead of leaving the guild I'd strive for two goals:<P>54: Symbol of Marzin, will make your ac/hp buffs nearly as effective as the 60 Aegolism, usually people will just accept that then Aegolism on a large raid unless you have a lot of 60 clerics.<P>56: Reviviscence, it makes you equal to all up to 60 in terms of resses.  Getting your epic is even better.<P>Just suck it up for a few more levels and you will become "usefull" again.  It's nothing against you, simply the way the game pans out.  Punishing your guild by denying them your clerical services helps no one.<P>54 and 56 aren't that far away.<P>Bala<BR>57 Cleric<BR>Lotus Cult<BR>Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Time to find another guild.<P>I say, go on the next raid as your cleric. and INSIST that you buff your group, you res your group and you do what you are there to do. If they don't let you, then right then and there type /guildremove and be done.<P>If that doesn't give them the hint, they dont need you anyway. Go find a guild who needs a good cleric and would appreciate you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Im only 48, but here's my thoughts.<P>We dont' have any 60 clerics, but we do have a 60 druid.  I'm glad when he gives Shield of the Glades (ubr HP buff) to the group I'm responsible for.<P>Casting Resolution on each member of my group does not make the game any more or less fun to me.  Just clicking buttons n stuff.  Not super fun.<P>However, if you are not having fun due to the fact that a 60 cleric always buffs and rezzes those you are responsible for healing, then you did the right thing.

</FONT><HR>My guild has a hard time keeping clerics as they move on to bigger and better things.  So some months I am the only cleric around and other months I am surrounded by higher clerics.  Those months I am surrounded by higher clerics I enjoy bringing out my alt, a level 52 shaman.   If you are not happy playing your cleric in guild events just let the guild know you will be playing the ranger more.<P>Get to know some people in smaller guilds and I am sure they can use you for future events.  There are a few decent to small sized guilds on our server that have very little clerics.

</FONT><HR>I rezz on raids if there is no rezz stick and only one or two 56+ clerics. Why? We want to get done and get people back up to the plane faster and get started again without much delay.<P>The 49-55 clerics usually handle rezzing of people level 53 and under... 56 clerics take the higher levels who will nag the lower clerics to let them rezz anyway :/<P>I don't understand how 6% can mean so much to someone... but at the same time, at 54 I can notice a big difference between the 56 and 49 rezzes already, so I generally try to save those 55+ people to get a 56 rezz rather than my own.<P>------------------<BR>Georgia Gaelicmyst<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Everlore Staff Member<BR>http://www.everlore.com/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I feel your pain, but this is not an abnormal thing at all.  People usually want the best they can get for a large-scale encounter.  Even as a Cleric, if I die and there is a 55 and a 56 Cleric available to res me, I'll wait for the Reviviscence.  No one usually wants SoW or Reso fom me if there are 52 or higher Clerics around.<P>All I end up doing is healing anyway and trying to say alive.<P>Hell, sometimes I'm so anonymous on raids that people don't realize I'm a Cleric until the ressing starts..

</FONT><HR>Sorry Ixcor,<P>I can't agree with you at all.  On raids where things like hit points matter, especially with high level Clerics along, it's quite reasonable that they handle the buffing.<P>I agree with the previous posters: hit 54 and I suspect you'll get plenty of opportunity to burn your Peridots =P.  And once you hit 56 they'll let you burn your mana on resses just like the others.<P>The reason you participate on raids at all at level 53 is you can generally outheal anyone not a Cleric higher than yourself.  And if I were running your raid and had to choose between a 53 Cleric and a 54 Ranger, well, what an easy decision =).<P>My two cents, do what you find the most fun.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Personally I don't see what the issue with the 49 rez is; I took one at 59 and did not notice the difference at all.<P>As far as buffing etc. is concerned, I don't see why it should be an issue either. If you were the tank wouldn't you want aegolism? All the tanks I know do too... even at 59 I am not the main tank buffer if there is a 60 around. Of course without some mana supply it's slow going casting aego on everyone, 750 mana a pop is no joke even at 60, you get maybe four out of a full mana bar. Personally I feel buffing is a neccessary evil and if someone else is handling it all the better.<P>There should still be many things you can contribute with your cleric. First, there's the chance that all the 56+ clerics will die on a bad pull; having any rez there is invaluable, so you are an insurance policy. Second, a complete heal from you is just as effective as one from a 60 cleric, and that's our bread and butter combat spell. Third, you can act as a mana supply to necros and shamans and anyone using mod rods with your healing. Fourth, not everyone needs aego and to cast it on casters is often a waste of time. Heroism will often suffice and you can provide that.<P>I've been in a similar position... going to fear/hate pre-50 all I had going for me was Resolution and Shield of Words. I still found many people I could stick my spells on and many ways to help out. But in a raid you have to realize that clerics are there for healing first and foremost. That's why you take a cleric instead of an extra warrior. Besides the casting of Aego, all your level 60 super clerics are doing is the same thing, healing people to keep them alive.<P>I sympathise with your feelings but you have to view a raid party as a single unit and not several group units. Viewed this way I'm sure you would like your tanks to have the best buffs and rezzes available too.<P>If you're that hungry to rez people do some levelling and get to 56... or if your guild has so many super clerics perhaps they are also capable of providing you with an epic before then. Symbol of Marzin at 54 is a big one too, so some relief is not far off.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Your frustration is understandable, Ixcor, but I can't agree with your reaction.  I believe that the correct attitude toward raid participation is that you should use your abilities in whatever way maximizes the group's effectiveness.  This may make you the star of the show, it may not.  The important thing is the effectiveness of the group as a whole, not how much you personally get to shine.<P>The objective truth here is that the level 56 res and level 60 buffs are better than level 53 spells.  In a close fight, a couple hundred more HP's or slightly better AC can make the difference between winning and losing.  This ought to take priority over letting everyone use their buffs.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Why be there at all if all you do is heal? <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>I don't think it's unusual for any class to be put into a specialized role in a raid situation.  The melees will probably just whack the mob, and the wizards will probably just nuke it.<P>This isn't to say that I don't understand how you feel, Ixcor.  I've spent a lot of time getting to level 55, and still have to endure people telling me they'll pass on my lowly 90% res.  But I recognize that in a raid, my personal pride needs to take a back seat to the welfare of the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I remember being told on a planes adventure that a cleric had camped already so I could camp or work in the hopes of pulling it out.<P>Well, the chanters were dead, most of the clerics were camped.  It was a massive over pull.  We were doomed.  I chose to stay and work.  I did not feel like I was unnecessary because there were other clerics to do the ressing.  I was glad to be given the choice. The tanks were glad to be getting healed.  We all died, except the clerics who camped.  It was great.<P>Which is to say, there are many ways to be useful.  I would have camped if the call went out.  I didn't res anyone and was glad to be ressed with a res stick instead of my own 49 res.  I am happy with my own res all the time. <P>I would also say that you need to adjust your attitude.  Shaman and druids make important contributions on raids.  When you say that your contribution is reduced to that of shaman and druid you do your guildmates a disservice.  Perhaps you have been upgraded in status.<P>Anyway, if you don't like being a little fish in a big pond, you might try being a big fish in a little pond.  In other words, join a smaller guild and be the biggest cleric in it.<P>I am currently the Highest level active cleric in our guild.  When I get a tell from a guildmate on another continent that he needs a res, I begin making plans to get there to res him.  Recently, I got a tell shortly afterwards letting me know he got a res.  I asked him if it was a 56 res and he said it was.  Was I miffed?  No, I was happy for him, and what is more, glad not to be inconvenienced.<P>I think you should be happy to be able to make a contribution on raids AND not have to buff everyone.  Be happy for your tanks having better buffs.  Be happy for those folks who get ressed by higher level clerics.<P>Or, just play the ranger.<P>tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>sorry ixcor i dont see your point<P>you want more buff duty, more resses job? or you feel uncomfortably about shammies and druid healing power? or you need more respect from your guildies?<P>i am the 60 cleric without res stick (will head to LoLO when i am extremly bored  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif">). I can make more bear steak and bear sandwich for my shammy friends if no "aego pls" from other groups. Yes to certain extent Level 59/60 shamman/druid has "close" healing ability to low 50ish cleric. whats wrong?<P>in many mid size raids like Trakanon,  Velketor 53 cleric can still contribute a lot. try a shammy or chanter with 2 or more higher levels in guild you may feel the real "pain". just my 2 cents  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>First...the Dain raid thing is awesome.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Second...I'm the senior cleric in my guild at level 41. I joined a growing guild where I could be relatively senior and have a say, rather than vanishing into an impersonal uberguild and becoming just another heal dispenser. I play this game to interact with people, not take them for granted. And if someone takes ME for granted, there's gonna be trouble.<BR> <BR>Also, I've done probably twenty resses in the last two days in EW...at level 40 and 41. People in need can't afford to be picky. If there was a higher level cleric that they wished to res them instead, I would understandably defer to that...why not take the best if you can get it? But my services are available if needed. <P>So don't get too upset about people wanting a higher res if it's readily available, that's only natural.

</FONT><HR>Man, I feel for you.<P>I suggest you find a new guild. My guild is struggling because we can't find enough high level clerics. We are finally (for the last 3-4 months) getting large enough and of high enough level that we can do Raids and such. All the high level clerics seem to get sucked up instantly by the larger or Uber guilds on our server. We currently have only one 49+ cleric.<P>It pains me to hear that there are clerics out there in guilds not being fully utilized while other guilds desperately need clerics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have to go with the majority on this one.  Just be glad you're able to go on these raids and you're actually wanted.  So what if you can't buff as much as you'd like.  Now, if casters are getting aego instead of hero/reso, then I can understand your frustration since the only pure caster that needs the best buffs are the enchanters.<P>When I quit eq the first time I played a wizard.  I was so po'd that the class had so many problems that I left eq.  I came back 6 months later and made a necro.  Played this character to his current level of 55.  I've had friends tell me I'm one of the best necro's they've ever played with, but you know what?  I still don't get invites for raids.  Why?  Because simply put, necro's are not needed.  <P>Well, now I play a cleric.  I have a great deal of fun playing him as well.  I'm not to the raiding level with him just yet, but I am well aware that when I am, I will mainly be reduced to healing for a bit, which is fine with me.  It's a hell of a lot more than I ever got to do as a necro.  Also, the lvl 56 res makes a huge difference over the 49 res once you hit 54+.  The hp/ac/symbol buffs do improve quite a bit as well.  I know that many 58+ clerics use naltron's mark since it's a group symbol.  As a cleric I wouldn't complain about this at all seeing how expensive it can get to buff 30 people.<P>As I said, at least you are wanted and needed as a cleric.  Try it as another class that has very little to offer and things won't seem so bad.  At least for me, I'm just glad to be along for the ride.<P>Krigor<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Everquest is a level based game, and one of the fundamental truths of a level based system is that higher levels are better than lower levels.<P>I'm sorry you can't handle that you're not the optimum cleric for every situation Dikmer, but forcing others to take lesser rezzes and lesser buffs because you hold the opinion that if you're in a group, they should be happy with taking whatever you deem fit to give them is just wrong.<P>I'm not level 60, I don't have my epic, and I'm frequently one of the second tier clerics on raids.

</FONT><HR>/sigh<P>I guess I just don't express myself well enough. I'll seperate the 2 issues and see if you understand.<P>Resses and "raids":<BR><B>In the abscence of a cleric with an epic</B>, there is NO reason not to take a level 49 res, if it means that the raid can get back and keep going faster. Refusing to accept a level 49 res, and slowing down the CR by as much as an hour, is NOT productive. Forcing ONE 56 cleric to res an entire raid while FIVE 55 and under clerics sit on their collective asses is NOT productive. I don't force anyone to take a 49 res, but refusing one and holding up CR is not a reflection on me, it's a reflection on YOU.<P>If a level 56 res is so damn important to you, then DON'T invite ME and get a flipping 56+ cleric to go in my place. <P>Buffing:<BR>At 53, I can buff my group as well as a 60 cleric, minus about 200HP and 3AC. (in one yellow bub, that drops to about 20HP and 2AC)  If I am not in the main group (and assuming there is a higher level cleric there, I should not be), then my group doesn't need that extra buffing. Give it to my chanter if you want to, but don't waste time or mana on the rest of us. Slowing down the whole raid so 1 or 2 high levels clerics can buff my group with a measly 200HP more than I can, while I sit around with FM and have nothing to do, that's just WRONG. It holds up the whole raid, since that high level buff is over 700mana. 1 or 2 people just can't keep up with a whole raid to buff without slowing things down.<P>The higher level clerics can buff the main groups, and I'll worry about my 5 people. That's what I am there for. <P>Summary:<BR>If you invite me, then you are saying that I am good enough for the raid. If you invite me, then don't use me, then you are insulting me by saying "We only brought you along because we couldn't find anyone better. Now sit over there like a nice bandaid and we'll let you know when you can heal."<P>I am NOT a walking bandaid, and if treated as such, I have a wonderful spell called GATE, and I use it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, the issue here isn't refusing a 49 rez because you want a 56 rez. The issue is that 56 rezzes are plentiful, and there's enough 60 clerics around to aego everyone. I don't really want to argue the 49 vs 56 rez thing, however, it's ludicrous to expect people to take a 49 rez when it's just as easy and efficient for a cleric with their epic to rez them. In your situation, yes, people were stupid and selfish, and should have taken 49 rezzes, but that's not the situation we're discussing.<P>As for being almost as good as buffing as a 60 cleric, you're just not. You need to accept this and move on. <P>Even if you could add the same hps and same ac (which, at 54 you're only 80 hps short of doing), you're ignoring the fact that the 2 buff spots Aego frees up can be used for other useful buffs, like the paladin buff Divine Strength (200 hps), the ranger buff Strength of Nature (75 hps and 25 atk) and more Shaman stat and hp buffs.<P>The difference between you and a 60 cleric is at least 300 hps, and possibly a lot more, depending on the encounter. Expecting people to sacrifice 300 hps just so you can feel less useless is selfish. <P>I realize you're only level 53 and you're likely to think of Hate, Fear and Naggy when someone says raid, but we're talking about Zlandicar, Velketor, the Dain and Vindicator. In a 6 group hate raid where you're going to be there for 4 to 6 hours, melees demanding Aego and a full line of buffs are being silly, but when you're talking about buffing for an encounter that's only going to take a few minutes, and where every hp could mean the difference between and win and a lengthy CR, demanding to buff your party yourself is tremendously selfish.<P>You do what you have to do to win. If someone's better than you at buffing people, you let them do so. If someone's better than you at rezzing people, you let them do so. You're still one of the best 6-10 healers at the encounter, and that's why you're there. Not to do what you want, everyone else be damned. You're there to heal, because that's what you're best at. <P>Like it or not, you are a band-aid that exists only to heal just like shamans exist only to kragg, focus, avatar and riotous before the charge and just like necros exist only to feed mana to the clerics and sometimes wizards.<P>If you don't like that, that's too bad, but think about all the other people at the raid who are worse than someone else yet accept that for the good of the group. What makes you more important than them?<P>Aiien.<p>[This message has been edited by Aiien (edited 04-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ok, coming from a guild that has more than 20 50+ clerics I feel I just have to respond to this.<P>Nearly every raid I attend there are so many clerics that we have at least a few groups with 2 clerics in them.  Being one of the lower lvl ones (until recently) this usually means not getting to do all that much.  But guess what, every raid you attend is a learning experience for you if you wake the hell up and pay attention.<P>If the cleric you are grouped with is 56 or lower then usually you can split buffs with him doing symbol and you doing ac to save you both mana.  If you are 54+ and they are 57-59 they take ac and you take symbol.  Most times there is a lvl 60 cleric around they are not gonna have the mana or desire to start casting aego on your group (exception being if you have one of the main tanks or enchanters)<P>As for the two extra buff slots, unless you are fighting one mob (epic fights, trak, etc) you usually aren't at full buffs so this really isn't all that vital 90% of the time.<P>Also what ixcor fails to mention but was pointed out by one of his guildmates on another board, is he was in the pull group for the raid that got him so ticked.  They were having him heal it so he would get a feel for it but the buffing was being done by a lvl 60 cleric b/c it was important for that group to have best buffs available.<P>You don't want to feel less useful than that lvl 60 cleric? Well get to 60 and get tired of never being able to lvl again but people wanting you to bring that char to raids all the time b/c you are 60 and offer the most to the raid    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif"><P>If you leave the guild you will either end up in another one where the same thing happens or in one where clerics are so needed you have to attend every raid or it doesn't happen (and despite what you may thing this starts to suck REAL fast), not to mention them wanting you to run to hell and back to rez.  If you are getting so little to do on raids as your cleric I doubt your guild is not going to have them when they need them for raids so playing your ranger probably won't bug them, and they might even prefer that you do /shrug /rant off<P>------------------<BR><B>Arianae Spiritmender</B><BR><B>55 Templar</B><P><BR><B>Arianwen Taur`amandil</B><BR><B>53 Wanderer</B><P><I>Phantom Raiders</I><P>Bertoxxulous<P>"<I>If dreams are like movies, then memories are films about ghosts</I>"  --Counting Crows<P>[This message has been edited by Arianae (edited 04-27-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Arianae (edited 04-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Why would you get bitchy at your guild because you are lower level? Why would you complain about someone putting buffs BETTER THAN YOURS on your group members? Thats just dumb. How about instead of complaining that the higher level clerics are better than you, and that you feel useless, LEVEL UP! Or, in the case that you like being lvl 53 and plan to stay there for a while, join a small guild which is barely planes capable.

</FONT><HR>Uuuh... maybe I'm in a different sort of guild, but I really, really am having trouble grasping what you're trying to say.<P>If we're raiding something where pretty much everyone gets damaged, or the outcome is in doubt, everyone gets _THE_ best buffs around. If someone told me mid raid that 'if you only brought me here for healing I'm gone', I'd prolly just boggle for a while and then ask him wtf did he think he was there for? He could level up or something if he wanted to be useful. Resses will come from sticks and the 4-5 lvl 60 clerics present will handle buffing. If thats insulting then I'd just tell you to bugger off and go be a whiner on someone elses raid.<P>The 'lvl 53 warrior wanting to primary tank' thing is pretty comparable. Warriors are supposed to be defensive tanks, not just rogues that do melee damage right? Then isn't it cruel that that *bleepin* lvl 60 warrior with ac1350 and 5700hp buffed ALWAYS gets to tank. The lvl 53 is not inferior just because he has only 1100ac and 4700hp.. hmm oops nm, he is. <P>Lvl 53 cleric isn't nearly as useful as a lvl 60 cleric, and you better just live with that fact. Level up and nobody will ever overwrite your buffs again.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://ascent.ipfox.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>,Rodcet Nife<p>[This message has been edited by Dalur - Veeshan (edited 04-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Honestly, I'd recommend you make your ranger your main and just play him.  You don't seem to have the temperment to do what your cleric's main role is.<P>I've got a high level tank, and I also have my high level cleric.  When I'm tanking, everything I do or try to have someone do for me (in preperation for an encounter) revolves around "what is the best I can get"?  This applies to my gear and the buffs I get.  If someone can throw Aeogism, I get that if at all possible.  Likewise for Protection of the Glades, resist buffs, haste, etc...  My job, as I see it, as a tank, is to claw for as many hps as I can obtain; this makes the Complete Heals more efficient and gives me and the healers more time to react and adjust when I start taking damage.<P>As a cleric, I want *my* tanks (the ones I'm personally responsible for healing) to be as uber buffed as possible.  Period.  These things make my CHs very efficient, and give me a lot more time to react to a problem.<P>So I *definitely* disagree with your attitude on the buffing.  Healing, any cleric 39+ can do at least core clerical healing in most situations using the ever wonderful Complete Heal.  The advanced heals like Celestial Elixr and Remedy are good too, but they're like the little icing roses on the cake; you're happy they're there, but you're happy after you already have the cake.<P>About the rezzing, however; your raid leaders and raid members need to get their heads out of their butts.  If there are enough 96% rez casters to hit everyone who died in a few minutes (like, five to ten minutes *tops*), then everyone *should* wait for the good rez.  Why throw away xp when you don't *have* to?<P>The circumstance you described where everyone (25-30+) on the raid was waiting on the single 96% rezzer to get around to them ...  Even if Clarity2 was on that guy, and even if the first couple of rezes went to necros (for mana dumps) and a druid/shaman (for regens on the liching necros) ... I still question that decision strongly.  The only exception I possibly see is if everyone on the raid was 55+.  At that point, the 6% xp difference between Resurrection and Reviviance is actually quite notable.  Still, kind of odd to have a raid with 25 or more 55+ people and only have a single 56+ cleric.<P>My guild uses a simple rule for wipeouts; if you're under 53, you will take a 90% rez if we have a large wipeout and are recovering.  The goal is to get things done as directly and efficiently as possible.  Since we've only got a very few number (I think two or three total) 56+ clerics, and only one rez stick (our 60 cleric has it), there's absolutely no way we're going to recover from a wipeout by sitting around for twenty or thirty minutes cycling mana into 96% rezzes.<P>Of course, if the rez stick is there, everyone gets a 96% rez because, well, duh.<P>Your job as the cleric is to heal and maintain the group you're with.  The raid leaders' job is to maintain the raid.  As the raid leader, I want the best possible chance I can get.  That means I *want*, if at all possible, the highest level buffs on my raid members.  If I have to explain *why* the higher level buffs are better and desired, you really really really need rethink your entire approach to gaming in general.<P>The point of a raid isn't to stroke your ego.  The point of a raid is to succeed.  That which contributes to this success is good, that which does not is bad.<P>Which area do your complaints fall into?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm sorry, but in the scenario described above, you are being selfish and putting your own 'needs' above the safety of others.<P>90% of the time, I'm the cleric in the pull group for my guild on raids.  If there is a higher level cleric with us, I'd be thrilled in they got something better than the buffs I can throw out at 51.  If my group have something stronger than reso and naltron on them, why not?  All it really does is make my life easier (not to mention saving me Peridots).<P>Now given, I play on Vazaelle, and a lot of the problems described aren't frequent yet.  There's only 3 or 4 clerics on the server with res sticks, and maybe 15 clerics over 56, so in the recent General/Kith wipeout of 50+ people, not one person muttered resentment that they were only getting a L49 res.  Regardless though, you better bet that on our last PoG raid, whenever someone died, I happly deferred to the L57 Cleric that was with us for ressing.  Why cost someone 6% of their death XP just because YOU want to res and not someone higher?<P>The first few posts in this thread seem pretty sad to me.  There's no reason other than pure and simple ego to /guildremove over something like this.  Again, as others have said, if your ego is too big for your level, join a smaller, lower level guild - otherwise, stop playing your alt and level your Cleric.<P>Anika Tinyhealer<BR>Level 51 Cleric<BR>Promethian Order - Vazaelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

If so, that would be in direct conflict with why I play this game, or any other game for that matter.<P>On the other hand, I completely agree that a multi-group raid should be viewed as one big group.  There are just kinder ways of handling it.  Like I remember awhile back when I was still level 53, a level 54 cleric sent me a tell saying "Mind if I cast Marzin on MainTank?"  "MainTank" was in my group, of course.  My reply was "Of course not!  Thank you."  <P>Same objective accomplished, but instead of resulting in an offended cleric, it resulted in a grateful one.
