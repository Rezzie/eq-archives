<br />
Was grouped with a level 52 sk, rogue and druid, 45 chanter and a 44 warrior with me being at 47 at the time.<br />
<br />
Being a loyal servant of brell I was there to bring holy vengence to those heathens who dared to call brell their god.  (its bad enough that the brothers of kaladim tolerate the gnomes).<br />
<br />
We got there at the same time as another group (assembly of knowledge from tribunal) and it was nice to have another party there to help out at times. (even ressed our rogue).<br />
<br />
Well the fight started when someone from the other group agro'd something and brought in a couple or three of the guardian elemental things at the gate.  They were around 45 so our enchanter told us and they certainly seemed to take alot of punishment.<br />
<br />
Anyhow we push on and get to a bit where there is a walkway up into the main part of the level.  We were told there were 5 of these nasty little guardians to kill if we went that way so we went down the side and dropped down into a pit.<br />
<br />
From here we pulled the odd elemental and flying fiend (or flappy as we called em).<br />
<br />
Then we got a golem.  I conned it...red.  The level 52's conned it...red. Oh dear god we have a level 55 here.  Its totally unstunable but thankfully it can be slowed.  The chanter slowed it and it agro'd on the chanter.  Me and the druid burn 50% of our mana keeping the chanter alive.  (one time the only time I could get it off the chanter was to taunt so much it went onto me.  Even with all my armour my hps dropped fast ...so fast that divine barrier was uncastable..had to use divine aura).  With one fight the chanters hps were not increasing even with chain casting heal from both me and the druid (I thought he was ld so I was thinking about another tactic when the chanter said something so I went back to healing.  In hindsight I should have atone up).<br />
<br />
I found using CH a bit dodgy at times.  I start healing at the normal 40% margin and sometimes they need a helping hand from the druid and sometimes they need a pray to brell to survive (although didn't lose anyone...had a kick ass druid).  If I had waited til 50% then it is possible that they wouldn't take enough damage and you just wouldnt get efficency out of the heal (and the fight drained me dry of mana and then some so I had to be efficent).<br />
<br />
In the end we got it down real low when I was oom and I crashed to desktop ( need to delete those opt files).  Thankfully when I came back the fight was over and we had just won.<br />
<br />
Needless to say after that long fight the elementals and such all became yard trash not to be worried about.<br />
<br />
The group over killed one and got a very nice bow 33 dam 50 delay +4 str +3 stamina or something like that.<br />
<br />
I have to say the hole is fun because its damn hard.  Its not the regular this is easy lets go farm items exp type thing.  It may get to that state when more is known about it but at the moment it remains largely unexplored.  <br />
<br />
oh btw ratties are funny to kill(being hit by a rodent made me laugh).<br />
<br />
As abashi has said... if you have fun, exp and loot fall into insignificance.  The hole is a case in point as we got neither of the later but a huge amount of the former.  The deal of the century i'd say!!!!</div></div><hr />
