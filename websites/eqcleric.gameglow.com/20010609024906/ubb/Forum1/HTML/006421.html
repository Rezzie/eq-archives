</FONT><HR>That one's kind of tame.  How come you didn't give a link to the one where a person asked if most rogues didn't PP or if they gave up the money.  90% of the rogues on that thread basically said they didn't care and they would keep whatever gems/spells they PPed in a pickup group.  When people from other classes started giving them flack, they just said it was a rogue skill and they were entitled to using it whenever they liked.  Much more damning than the thread you posted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I still don't have any problem grouping with rogues.  In fact I really like them for the massive damage they can do.   All the rogues I know tell the group whenever they PP an item.   And coin that they PP doesn't come off out of the loot, so that is irrelevant.   I guess the key is to group with rogues you know and trust to not cheat you... I suspect that eventually Verant will put in a message for pickpocketing similar to the message they put in for people looting.<P><P>------------------<BR>Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>Templar of Tunare, <BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have to say I got a kick out of reading that thread.  I have a fundamental problem with people complaining about the rogue stealing from them and completely ignore the fact that the item is coming from something they are murdering....  EQ is not our world.  It's a place of high adventure and wonder where evil and good are fighting for control, where magic, gods, and dragons exist.  <P>My dwarven cleric isn't a pansy christian priest with the morals of an americal adult.  He's of another race, growing up in a far harder land.  He's stared evil in the face and has a bloody mace telling the story of who survived that encounter.  Would I like to meet him? Frankly, I think he'd scare the hell out of me.  And just as my cleric isn't me, I don't blame the person playing the rogue like a ROGUE.  Just cause they play EQ like a role playing game and not a good quake mod isn't a reason to not group with them.  <P>If you want a fun challenge, figure out how to solve this problem of someone stealing from you in character. It's not something verant should fix.  It's also not something you should fix by looking at the rogue and saying 'give me the phat loots you just stole'.  Remember, he's been trained to kill and has a sharp pointy bit with the blood of his last victim still running down the blade =) Rogues aren't the only people who can use wit and fast talking to their advantage.<P>Kandolek<BR>54 cleric on BB<BR>Seekers of Lore</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, don't damn rogues unless you understand a little bit about pickpocket.  It isn't easy to get Gems or other loot.  In fact some times it's hard to get plat off of a mob.  And undead don't have pockets to pick btw.  And everything, including coin, comes off the mob's loot.  There is a chance for the mob to catch you and call out that you are picking.  Verant will never ad a message telling group members what the rogue is picking.  If you don't want to group with a rogue, then don't.  I'm sure the rogue would feel similar about someone that doesn't understand that this is a game.<BR>Also, rogues don't steal from friends.  But stealing from people that aren't your friends, well that is a moral dilemma isn't it?<P>Raith<BR>Lvl 55 Human Rogue<BR>Fennin Ro<P>PS. I love clerics by the way.  But being judged by your class and not by who you are pisses me off.  But then again, I am a rogue.

</FONT><HR>I really think Verant should make it so the things pick pocketed come from another pool of loot.  That way the rogue always gets their class specific ability of making cash while the rest of us get our regular loot.<P>For the most part I rarely loot as I am always medding.  My cleric isn't my primary so I have a decent amount of pp in the bank.  But if I were fighting mobs that I knew dropped spells, I would be very wary of including a rogue, who isn't a friend, in my group after reading that thread.  Heck, a rogue named Impirius who posted to that thread I will never let in my group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>  This is pretty bad, but I have to admit, a rogue is a rogue...  Kinda sounds the same when other classes loot class specific armor!  Hmm...let's take Ravenscale armor for instance.  That is a rogue only armor and the groups that I have been in have not let me have the armor.  We usually end up agreeing on a roll.  This is probably not the same with other classes.  The Shadowknight armor, Darkforged for instance.  Most of the groups that I have been in have never let me loot any decaying armor for the Shadowknights Darkforged armor quests.  I am sick of classes looting class specific armor to only sell it to make a profit.  I think you guys should think twice before posting your thoughts.  Thank you for your time.<P>Fernadro level 56 cleric<BR>Steelshadow level 11 rogue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Eachann:  You are mistaken.  When a rogue picks coin, it DOES come from the coin loot you would normally see once it dies.  The way it works is that the last coin of any type (pp gp sp cp) cannot be picked....so if you see a lot of loots with 1pp 1gp etc...you have a picking rogue.<P>Kandolek:  Shame on you for insulting the Christian faith by calling their priests "pansy".  I am not even a Christian and I found that offensive.  Your insulting remarks have no place on this site.

</FONT><HR>Georgia, What you failed to read in Prod's post is that she did not say that she kept the gems that she PP'd.  You just assume that she did and that's really not fair,<P>This whole thing is just a little out of hand at this point,  99% of the time we pick cash, which we and just about anyone else in the 50+ range would destroy anyway.  The topic of the thread was BEST thing/ammount you have picked, not your average amount.  Lets all try to realize that diamonds and blue diamonds are not picked on a daily basis and that they don't only drop in the planes and OS.  To date I have picked a diamond and a blue diamond, one time each, not once a week or once a month, but ONCE in 53 levels.  Realx, you aren't missing that much and a large majority of rogues don't keep items, spells and gems that they loot.<P><BR>As far as clerics getting rich in OS...I have yet to see that on my cleric.  I think my cleric has 400p in the bank.  My solution is to not symbol anyone other then the enchanter unless they provide their own reagents.  I think by lvl 55 they can afford to buy their own peridots.  This only applies in pick up groups.  Fortunatly, Samsara and I are both in guilds that take care of their clerics so it's not even an issue on raids.  Besides, when was the last time a warrior actually needed a symbol for your average mob in OS?  Rogue need symbol?  Not likely, if they are good they should rarely need a heal, let alone a symbol buff.  All these people just think they have to have the highest HP they can get at all times.<P><BR>Jayesin 53 Rake<BR>Geliel 55 Templar<P><BR>*waves at Sammy*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hmm. As I've been playing both a rogue(45) and a cleric(50), I think I can give an unbiased opinion on this.<BR>People are complaining that rogues steal things. They do this. They also open locked doors that nobody else can, perform corpse recovery from dangerous places, and have a variety of other skills which would be viewed as questionable by society today. How often have you paid a rogue to pull your body from under Vox or some dank hole? Necromaners typically charge to summon that corpse, yet the rogue does it partly for the sense of adventure that comes from the job, partly because they feel wanted for something that doesn't involve them stabbing something repeatedly. It's rare you'll find a rogue expecting payment for anything you get from them...I don't know why, guess we're just used to being the stepchildren of Norrath.<BR>At one time the coin pool was indeed seperate from monster loot (coin only, not items), however VI in their infinite wisdom figured out that billions of rogues were becoming insanely rich from stealing a handfull of coppers from mobs. Also, somewhere around this time, an old (retired I think) rogue demonstrated how INSANELY powerful pickpocket was by stealing items from the mighty Nagafen himself...thus began a long list of nerfbattings upon the profession. <BR>To enlighten you of the known rules by which a pickpocket lives, they cannot steal magic items, nor can they steal from things which are not humanoid and alive. As was mentioned, they can steal up to but not the last coin of a given type on a mob. While they can sneak and hide, the act of stealing breaks the hide so in trying to be the stealthy thief there are inherent problems.<P>Now, as a cleric I have always had a superior bank account to the rogue any day. Talura rarely has to pay for services that Reini winds up begging to be able to 'donate' for. I am, unfortunately, very forthcoming with my exploits as a rogue which is probably why she is often broke.<BR>Similarly, with Talura I can find a port or sow in short order, and the frequent response I get to 'how much?' is 'nothing, I may need a res someday'. I've been some places where gems were freely given and other places where a gem dropped and nobody gave a crap that I'd been symbolling. (Lately more of the latter, unfortunately.) None the less, after a month of no gem loot and running around in places like Sebilis, Karnor's, lguk, planes and dragons Tal's balance still exceeded Rei's by at least 3k.<P>Most melee classes cannot farm the items they need to survive, and unfortunately rogues are the vogue class of late so twinks are rampant. This winds up driving the rarity and price of rogue gear, that money has to come from someplace or you'll be grouped with an underequipped rogue. Would you group with someone wearing ravenscale and banded, wielding a dragoon dirk and serrated bone dirk at level 45? Or would you prefer the rogue decked out in Mrylokar's and Runed Mithril, with a jagged ice shard and bone razor?<BR>/shrug. <BR>I guess in closing I'll say that if you don't trust the rogue in your group then by all means exclude them. It's really your loss. If that gem is truely that important to you, it's your choice. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Jayesin/Geliel, as a 50's Cleric with 400 platinum in the bank, you can see where the anger is coming from.  As a 50's Rogue/Cleric, you are in a unique position to suggest how this should be fixed.  What do you suggest?  Should Clerics find out the gem drop rates and keep track and shake down Rogues when the drop rates don't tally, or should Verant add a message?  Or do you have some other suggestion?  I have a soft spot in my heart for Rangers, Rogues and Monks (though I do wince when they are my primary tank).  I don't like excluding them from groups, it is a game played for our own and other's enjoyment.  If I catch them STEALING from me though, they can not only expect to not group with me, but to pay a premium for a resurrection if I am even willing.<P>Being broke takes a lot of my fun out of the game.  Clerics bear the weight of most of the cash sinks in the game, how do you feel we should we react to this?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I really don't think anything needs to be done about it.  Coin loot really ammounts to nothing at the higher levels, and as I said, picking high dollar gems is VERY rare.  99% of the rogues out there DO NOT keep those type of picks.  I picked a fire emerald last night and offered it to the group, no one wanted it.  I understand your concern on 55+ cleric spells, they are way to rare, but I have yet to pick any spell for any class that I didn't give to the group loot person to distribute.  <P>I think the problem is that the majority of groups out there are "need before greed" and since there is so little content in the high level game for clerics/wisdom casters that we rarely get gear upgrades thus leaving us very little to sell.  I suppose I could sit around in KC and rez people for 100p a shot, but that's boring and it's kinda a cheezy way to make money, by taking advantage of your fellow players misfortune.<P>Like I said, high level gem picks are very rare and most of us rogues wouldn't keep them.

</FONT><HR>Ok i have a rogue and a cleric 54 an 52 respectively.  As a rogue in seb PPin is not as effective as you are being lead to believe by the posters in the safehouse.  In seb, first off, you have time to maybe PP a mob 5 or 6 times in a fight, you fail 50% of the time on these attempts. leaving lets say 3.  2 out of 3 of these times you are gettin gold, silver, and copper. leaving 1 which is 50/50 gold plat pick. Now in in maybe, maybe,maybe 100 picks does a rogue get a gem which consists of a fire opal or lesser gem. And in my months of fighting in seb i have never PPd a diamond or a blacksapphire or a bluediamond though i know it is possible. Also i have once ever PPd a spell, which was givin to a group member who needed it.  Maybe 10% of rogues out there keep what they steal(other than coin).  We PP the mob, brag to a fellow rogue what we got and then tell the group to lotto this gem/spell.  We view PP as a class skill that we enjoy to use to see what we get, but most of us are far from greedy.  Hopefully you see 3things, 1: we dont steal as much as you think and 2: we mostly give back what we do take. 3: PP is more about bragging rights than loot</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, I usually group with one rogue on normal basis and have never had a problem with it. Rogue's are excellent damage dealers, not to mention the CR skills if you should ever need them. One solution would be to have the rogue Master Loot. That way they can pp to their hearts content. The normal rogue that I group with has used his pp skil on many occasions to cover my cost of symbols when the group we are in isn't covering the cost. My 2cp's worth, the actions of a few rogue's doesn't make the whole class bad. If you have a concern than discuss if before hand and judge that rogue in that situation. Rogue's will always be a welcome addition to any group that I'm in.<P>Findy 51 cleric of Morell Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Bah, I guess I'm fixing to join the list of "elitist scum" with the Zekkers. I really don't care.<BR>1. I do not support the idea of adding theft messages to the game. They've already diluted the rogue class to nothing more than an armed and armored monk, only without feign death and mend. (And I do not think they should get either of these skills either.)<BR>2. If you have a trust issue with your group's rogue, take it up directly with him. If he is and refuses to share, guess it's time to find a new rogue. If he isn't, then I guess you'll still be paranoid and suspect that he is privately.<BR>3. Gem costs...well, I've basically taken the line that if the tank(s) don't want to provide 'dots when necessary (until some sort of monetary loot is come up with to compensate) then they can live with Pinzarn. Come up with some BS line, you haven't been to town and are low on stock, so you're just hitting the chanter and puller. /shrug. If the rogue's lieing cheating and stealing, join the crowd. Don't like it, don't group with me. I really despise the XP grinding required now anyway...I'll go back to farming greens for tailoring so I can get my shawl before the third coming of the Anti-Innoruuk.<P>------------------<BR>Talura cwn'Zeylon, Regent of Hate<BR>Silver Hawks, Drinal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Khaash. Hehe. I guess I should have explained. The pansy christian reference was more about me. I'm not a priest, but belong to a strong Catholic family. I used the reference because I live it =) <P>The comparison was supposed to be more between what a priest is today, and what a dwarven cleric, who's been in battles for most of his life, would be like.  The average person in the US today has far more mental challenges than physical usually (Even in war torn areas, the priests are not the people who usually wield the weapons).  Also my dwarven cleric has that aspect where he follows a god who is willing to make direct and visible intervention in the world, whether through direct appearance or the spells that the cleric wields. And my cleric interacts with this being all the time. <P>I try to imagine what this dwarf might be like. Even if he is a great person, full of honesty and courage, meeting someone with that power and conviction would probably scare some people (the word fanatic is developing harsh overtones lately but it describes an EQ cleric somewhat accurately). It's fun trying to figure out the role of something that is pretty much beyond any scope of your experiance, esp. for a person from a completely foreign culture wielding powers we sometimes which we could possess. <P>I am sorry if I offended anyone with my comments on religion though.<P>Kandolek<BR>54 cleric on BB<BR>Seekers of Lore</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm referring to some posts on this thread about half way up  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I said that when  rogue PP's coin, it does not come from the party loot and when the rogue gets items it does come from party loot.   A couple of people told me i was wrong about that...  that everything comes from the group.<P>I used to think the same thing, because i know for a fact that at one time that's how it was.  But I believe that has been changd.  A rogue in my guild first brought it to my attention... he said that it had been changed a while back and that Coin comes from a separate pool... he said he had tested it thorughly.    So, I took my rogue (level 35) and started testing it myself.  I haven't tested it enough to be conclusive, but so far it appears that he is right.   If I loot a pp or 2 pp off of a mob, and then loot it I still get 2-4 pp off of the mob when I loot it.   If i don't PP anything from it , I still get 2-4pp off the mob... it seems like PP'd coin has no effect on what the group loots.   Now if I PP words or something like that off of a mob that definately does come out of the group loot.<P>I'm not saying any of you are wrong... because like i said I don't think i've conclusively proven it, but the evidence seems to be that I'm right about this.. that coin is a separate pool.<P><P>------------------<BR>Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>Templar of Tunare, <BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>There are not 2 pools of loot unfortunately.  The better way for you to test it would be to kill some things that take a long time to kill.  PP the whole fight, and when you loot at the end, you will see a lot of loots with only 1 coin per type.  For example. 1pp, 1gp, 1sp, 1cp. or 1sp, 1cp.<P>Verant stated a while ago that there was only one pool.  So when a rogue pp's, he is taking from the group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Very VERY long ago there used to be a separate coin loot pool for pickpocketing. When I started in Beta 3 I had a cleric and a rogue, and my rogue would regularly pick handfuls of 120, 60, 80 copper off of orc pawns. This was also when you got pickpockets at level 4 I believe.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Anyway, that was changed a LONG time ago, now the rogue can only pickpocket up to the last coin of each type, but he or she cannot take the last coin.<P>For example if a creature starts out with 3pp, 20gp, 50sp, 100cp the rogue can pick a MAXIMUM of 2pp, 19gp, 49sp, 99cp (leaving the MOB with 1pp, 1gp, 1sp, 1cp). Obviously, this makes it easy to tell if the rogue in your group is picking things dry after a while - this is easily remedied by having the rogue master loot and split coins at the end.<P>------------------<BR>Corii Se'Lune<BR>Devoted of Quellious<BR>56th Rank Templar<BR><A HREF="http://succoringwinds.ipeasy.com" TARGET=_blank> Succoring Winds </A>- Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Talura cwn'Zeylon:<P>"~insert long post comparing a rogues other abilites that cost ZERO plat to use like open locks, CR, etc, o a cleric's symbol that COST money~"<P>No sense in even going there bud. A cleric resses his group for free (which does not cost him plat) just like a rogue should pick locks for his group for free (cause it doesnt cost him a single copper). If you want to validate your argument, list some group-enhancing ability the rogue performs that cost hard plat per use. You can't. So trying to compare the 2 is silly and, frankly, insulting<P>Isildor:<BR>"We PP the mob, brag to a fellow rogue what we got and then tell the group to lotto this gem/spell. We view PP as a class skill that we enjoy to use to see what we get, but most of us are far from greedy."<P>Oh really? How come never once, not a SINGLE time in Seb (almost 58th level now, been in seb a majority of post 50 career), has a rogue ever brought forth a gem or spell that he PPed off the group? Cause it doesnt happen mate. You might do that, but you are in the tiny minority. As soon as they PP that rare spell or gem, the first things they think about are NOT the group they are in, its the guild they belong to; "Oh yea, so-and-so said he was looking for this rare cleric spell..." or "Rogues have always been dissed, i deserve this" or "Man, that wizard is a jerk, im keeping this gem for meself." <P>So please, do not sit there and preach how rogues, in Seb in particular, PP then turn around and offer them up for group random (or give lesser gems to the cleric). It simply does not happen that way 99.99% of the time. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wisecleric, aye i would agree that all rogues dont give back what they steal, but your sayin that you dont see rogues give back what they steal ever.  The point that you missed about my post is the we DO NOT get gems an spells that often at all, if i steal one gem in a week i am amazed(with 200skill), and yes i random them, but others may not. The biggest reason you might not be seeing a return is because the rogue HASNT gotten anything good while you were grouped with him.  Everyone assumes that rogues are stealing all the time as much as possible.  Even when im in 4r down there and there is a crappy money drop people make a comment about it even though rogues CANNOT steal from the undead.  Sometimes when people complain about what a rogue might be stealing, that makes the rogue want to prove a point about what can happen if we do decide to pick a mob clean.  Its everyones choice to take the rogue or not, we spent 18 months as the step-child class of this game and are finally enjoying the fact that people need/want us in groups, and it rubs me the wrong way to see these posts about how rogues hurt groups by stealing a gem or a spell when it just doesnt happen as much as everyone seems to think it does.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

One 4000pp blue diamond? Maybe one rare 10,000pp spell? <P>The simple fact is most rogues over at the popular rogue site The Safehouse, readily (and some quite proudly) admitted to keeping valuable items PPed off of mobs (not in the thread posted above, but in another one concerning the fairness of PPing and not revealing it). Many others, even though they hadn't themselves, agreed with the idea. What are other supposed to think when they see this? Is it not reasonable to assume that the Safehouse is a pretty active site that has a reasonable sample of EQ's rogue population? I sure do. <P>As a result, i no longer group with rogues that i do not know or consider my friends unless they are required. I put up with enough in this game as it is. No need to concern myself with other players possibly cheating the group out of hard earned items if i dont have to. <P><BR>Backstab a monster, good for group.<BR>Backstab a party member, bad for grouping. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>again you are totally missing my point entirely, i said nothing about owing anyone what im trying to push across is that rogues are not getting the amount of stuff that you think they are getting. And no, the safehouse public website does not represent the rogue community, they represent more the "flavor of the month" community, the root cellar represents us as a class.  True rogues might not mind a nerf on PP for 2 reasons. 1. all of the faux rogues will stop playin (hopefully) making us once a again a rare class, an 2.  we dont revert to being shunned by groups.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>OMG this topic is pretty stupid. We for one as clerics should not be bitching about rogues. How many of you regularly walk away from a sebilis group with 2-3k in gems alone just being given to you for casting symbol? I know I have MANY times. We are the number one class for generating money in this game, the second one being the rogue. How many of you have offered to split the money with the group after selling every gem they have given you after breaking even? Uh huh, thought so. So an extremely lucky rogue manages to pickpocket a blue diamond, GOOD FOR THEM! For many rogues, this might happen maybe once or twice in their whole life. Thats just a draw back of pick up groups.<P>------------------<BR>-Avenea Arach'Daemos 60 High Priestess-<BR>Cazic-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006421-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006421-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006421&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006421&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
