Kunark experience bonus helps this even further with a full 80% here as opposed to 70% for outdoor areas in Faydwar and Antonica.<br />
<br />
Never came here between 8-19.. but been here from 19-23 (now.. still there) and it is a great place to hunt. When your a mid teen in level, the mill is perfect for you to find a small group and hunt from.. especially because there is usually many people around the mill to assist you in times of need.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 20ish you have several very good places to hunt. the Sarnak Fort if you have a good group, provides virtually non-stop fun. The goblin tower and haunted ruins close to the mill are very nice for smaller groups or solo if your brave  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif . The goblin tunnels also are an excellent place to camp outside and pull from, although if you want to go inside I would recommend a full group of 23+ people as it can get pretty intense.<br />
<br />
And the loot is pretty decent too. When I group we usually do Alpha loot with autosplit off (in case you didn't know, autosplit is bugged big time and only divides on the total number of coins.. not the total amount). In the last week I have looted 3 Sarnak Flesh Harvesters (at 250pp per they are quite nice).<br />
<br />
The only drawback is banking... unless your willing to pay for a TP outta Omen, the nearest bank is in FV.... which walking to can be very dangerous indeed.<br />
<br />
I definitely plan on being here until at least 27 or so...<br />
