<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">piikaa</div><div class="date">01-18-2002, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hunted with a group in Dawnshroud Peaks last night.  I got 8 blues in 1 hour of play.  Our group of five had 3 meele, me &amp; a Druid (also 31, dinged 32 there).  Everyone in our group wound up with a DING last night, but no loot other than meat and pelts.  We stuck to Zelneks, wolves, lightcrawlers and fungi.  We had one death experience, when fighting one wolf, another 2 showed up and 3 shrooms appeared.  MT and MA died, so did I.  The other two got to zone in time.  <br />
<br />
We parked on the hill to the right of the entrance, and had the monkey pull for us.  Not many ADD's, good single pulls, with great exp.<br />
<br />
Next time, I'll remember to bind self before hunting.  I'ts a long ride from Friona Vie to the Moon!!!<br />

That being said, when we were assymbling to go outside, had A Bloodstarved Wolf show up to fight and I had to GHeal the Monkey 7 times!!!  Save your mana, you will need it here.<br />
