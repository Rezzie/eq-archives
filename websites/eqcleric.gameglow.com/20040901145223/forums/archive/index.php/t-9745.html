I am a grouper by nature, but wanted to give soloing a shot. I headed over to the night time undead spawn at Lake Rathe.<br />
I am level 23.<br />
<br />
Con a Dry Bones. Blue-looks kinda risky.<br />
<br />
Root/Expulse(34 dmg?)/Root(again)/Expulse(17 wtf?)/Stun(resisit)/HolyMite(Resist)/Root(resist)/Stun/Expulse(94-Finally!)....<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
Thank Brell, a group was nearby to nuke the db's sliver of health and heal my sliver...<br />
<br />
Granted, there were lots of resists, and My expulse didn't go off at full potential, but this has been happening quite a bit lately.<br />
My Expulse used to be a constant stream of 94dmg. Now, I'm lucky to get 2 in a row. Sometimes I think Smite is more consistent these days.<br />
<br />
Root? Bah. Might as well call it &quot;resist&quot; or at least &quot;break after one good expulse&quot;<br />
<br />
Holy Mite- More resists than stun (bizarre considering the level of spell)<br />
<br />
Stun- Love this spell.<br />
<br />
Do I completely suck here? What am I doing wrong. Any tips for me on how to be a more effective solo'er?<br />

<br />
With stun, there is one affect- stun. The mob has a chance to resist the stun, if it fails, it's stunned. <br />
<br />
However, with Holy might, it's a dual effect- stun + damage. The mob gets to try to resist the stun, and IF it fails to resist that, it gets to try to resist the damage. If it sucessfully makes it's resist on the damage, both affects are resisted.<br />
<br />
I suck at statics, and I know this formula is off, but you'll get the idea. Let's assume an even con mob has a 50% chance to resist your damage and debuff spells.<br />
<br />
Stun - 50% of sucess<br />
H Might - 25% of sucess (50% for stun, PLUS 50% for damage)<br />
<br />
That help at all?<br />
<br />
Oh, and with root every time you do damage to a rooted mob it gets to try to resist (break) the root spell, and from what I can tell the damage and type is a factor. Big DD will give it alot higher chance to break than meele or small DoT.<br />

I even went back to the camp when I got dismiss undead( the 150DD ) to goof around and Dry Bones would still forkin resist as much as 50% sometimes. drove me nutz!!<br />

Think Mana management. Use Root, High DD, and a lower  DD to finish him off. Stun will give you no payback on damage compared to a DD spell. Stuns are Great when your in a group and have tanks, but not useful when soloing. And once in a while root with stick really good. Plus look at mana cost for root and the length of cast time. Old root, its a mighty fine spell. Anyways save your mana during a battle. You may need it to Gate out or Go invis. (hehe)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thadeus</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When soloing I almost never use root or stun.  Root gets resisted too much and the MOB always breaks it at the first damage spell.  <br />
<br />
I just slam the MOB with the highest damage spell that I can.  I hit 'em with Furor for a couple and then Strike to finish them off.  Then I use the AC and melee to assist the spell in killing the MOB.<br />
<br />
I do not use WoP when soloing.  I use it in a group sometimes but it isn't all that affective.  It takes too much mana and does too little damage.  It does 20 dmg to all monsters but a low level paladin or warrior can do that much damage with a good weapon.  Furor does 17 dmg and uses half the mana so I get 34 dmg for the same as WoP.  Is it the same with the higher levels AE spells?<br />
<br />
Prior to the battle I always cast all buffs on myself.  Don't forget the buffs.  When hunting blacks or yellows, buffs make a huge difference.<br />
<br />
(Druids get more effective buff spells for fighting.  Shield of Thistles, Str of Earth, Thistlecoat, and Skin like Rock are better than Holy Armor and Center when fighting.)<br />
<br />
I can take yellows with this strategy and still have 2 bubbles of health.<br />

Vs. 2 or more mobs, it's actually more mana efficient than Wrath is...so they DO get better. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminar</div><div class="date">12-10-1999, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thadues, at higher levels if yo udont root you just consider yourself dead.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
And as another poster said, forget stun. Unless its a caster who has little hp, then you can splurge some mana on stuns to minimize the damage he does to you in spells. Other wise root and dd.  Also dry bones are around lvl 23 (atleast they are in unrest) if not higher, so you will get resisted. You get much less resisted on a mob 5+ levels below you. (Goul lord is blue to me at 47, but I dont have a chance in hell of soloing him hehe). Also if your useing smite/wrath/retro your generally limited to mobs much lower then you. Im barly able to kill a solusek kobold solo at 47, and its like lvl 39 or 40. But thakfully they still give good exp...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twigg Bramblefoot</div><div class="date">12-12-1999, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just another note to the original poster of this thread.  DBs are hard to solo even when they're blue or green to ya almost.    http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
It's just that combo of spells and good attack value that make DBs very powerful. I'd go to unrest and tackle some of those skeletal monks or what not since they can only attack with hands. I was killing yellow monks there by rooting and nuking those bastards to death, and if they got mouthy with me I just shattered their jaw with my bullsmasher!!!    http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
You're at the the last level before a new circle. This is the hardest part of your level. The stuff that was blue (at 19) is now green, and the stuff that's blue is a lot more badass, while your spells are still only level 19. (Nice sentence, I know) Get 24th, and then you'll see an improvement. The 20's are difficult. <br />
<br />
I didnt use stun at all when solo. Root kicks much ass, even at level 50, trust me. At 30 when specialize kicks in, it will help. There will always be mobs you can solo for xp as a cleric, you just have to find them, and learn a strategy.<br />
<br />
Group play is better until you hit 44, however. Then you start doing some respectable damage, while the mobs can lag further behind in level and still give xp.<br />
