<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monual</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so, finally got my singed scroll from the Overking.  This took an annoyingly long time, since my guild doesn't have a rogue.  We finally hooked up with another guild; they provided the non-KOS rogue, we provided the non-KOS mage.  They traipsed merrily through the palace, rogue opened the locked door, mage Call-of-the-Hero'd us in, and we proceeded to do a couple of cycles of King / Prince.<br />
<br />
(As an aside, just as we were getting ready for our first Overking fight - the one designated for myself - we got a GM message:  Servers coming down in fifteen minutes.  Quickly, we pulled the Overking and eight of his best friends.  Chanters frantically mezzed, we took down Overking.  I stood over his corpse while half a dozen people screamed &quot;Loot!&quot; in my ear.  Finally I was able to loot and the raid evac'd with five minutes to spare.  Even more amazingly, the scroll was still there in my inventory after the patch.  After the patch we re-formed the raid and did one more cycle.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, recently a Ragefire list was created for Drinal.  The requirement to get on the list is to take a screenshot of your Swirling Pearl (yes, these can be faked, but we're not terribly worried about forgeries at this point).  So dutifully I went to SolB and found Ragefire up there, got my pearl, took a screen shot, and sent it in to the queue moderator.  I checked the list, and my heart sank.<br />
<br />
I am 28th on the list.<br />
<br />
Given an average of five days per pop, I'll get my epic around Christmas maybe.  There was muted outrage in my guild over this fact, with some murmurings that we should ignore the list and just take out the Skyfire version of Ragefire the next time he pops.  I made it quite clear I would not allow this to happen.<br />
<br />
And yet, I cannot help but sympathize.  Ragefire lists remind me a lot of MLM schemes: great if you get in on the scheme early, a terrible mistake if you're one of the last to join.  While my small guild suffers from the fact that we have no epic cleric, I have to sit and watch for months while others line up to get theirs.<br />
<br />
I can't help but yearn for the old days of free-for-all.  My guild is quite motivated and sufficiently powerful to take down Ragefire easily.  We could easily camp Ragefire, mobilize our forces, and take him down quickly.  I could, right now, sit and camp him for days until he pops.  We're ready, we're eager, and we're willing to try and race other folks who want Ragefire for themselves.  We *want* a free-for-all; we think we can come out on top.<br />
<br />
But... well, I remember a time when one guild got three consecutive Ragefire spawns for their clerics.  Because they had a lot of folks that were quite powerful, they could just swoop down and take Ragefire at will.  This isn't necessarily fair to the other clerics on the server, who are equally eager to get their epic but don't have the firepower at their disposal to compete with the bigs.  Belonging to an uber guild should *not* be a requirement for getting the cleric epic.  The second person on the Drinal Ragefire list is unguilded; certainly without this list, that cleric would be hard-pressed to ever get their epic.<br />
<br />
So, our choices are to either go back to the days where everyone fought with each other over Ragefire and guilds were kill-stealing each other and powerful guilds were monopolizing Ragefire at the expense of the smaller guilds and unguilded clerics.  Or we can use the list, which means that some clerics will have to wait months for their epics.  I can easily see the list growing until it's a year-long wait.<br />
<br />
Argh.  Moral dilemma... brain imploding...<br />
<br />
I have to sit and simmer while our guild chanter prepares to get her epic next weekend after getting her drop from the prince in Chardok.  We're also planning on getting one of our officers, a Beastlord, his epic... which will take one day from beginning to end.  Meanwhile I will have to wait five months while I watch other clerics - who belong to guilds that have *plenty* of epic clerics - merrily get their epic.<br />
<br />
The fault, of course, is Verant's, who came up with this lame system because they felt a need to control the rate at which cleric epics would enter the world.  I dunno, I somehow doubt that the Drinal server would suddenly come unglued if 28 cleric epics were unleashed in one day.  I really really wish Ragefire was on a faster timer.  What harm could it really do?<br />
<br />
/flame Verant<br />
/flame Ragefire list<br />
/flame my own impatient greedy nature<br />
<br />
That having been said, I have every intention of respecting the list, and under no circumstances will I allow my guild to circumvent it.  I will do nothing at all, ever, to disrupt the attempt being made to overcome the Ragefire madness by using an orderly list.<br />
<br />
I just wish it was better.  I just wish I could get my epic sooner.<br />
<br />
What do y'all think?<br />

<br />
Sure you can go get Ragefire right now.. you'll just force 27 people to wait longer for theirs. Anyways, I think you're making the right choice by respecting the list.<br />
<br />
The fact is, everyone does what is most in their benefit, without concern for the benefit of everyone. If everyone could respect a list, then there would be no need to have to give up sleep for a week, and everyone would be happy. However, as long as everyone feels more entitled then everyone else to their epic, we'll have these problems.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's the problem... I'll respect the list, but I *won't* be happy.  And there are perhaps 50 people at the end of the M-T list that won't be happy either.  How'd you feel that your turn on the list won't come until the end of 2003?  I bet you wouldn't be happy, either.<br />
<br />
That's why, in some ways, the free-for-all was better.  For some, it was a test of sheer willpower - the ability to stay awake and connected, to motivate others to come help you, and quickly, when Ragefire spawned.  If you wanted your epic, you had to *prove* it.  And I'd be willing to test my desire against that of the other 27 people on the list.  (And yes, I have a regular 40-hour-a-week job.)<br />
<br />
Again, I have no intention of going around the list.  But I am *not* happy with it, and will never be.  It's the best you can choose from a list of bad options regarding the Ragefire spawn.<br />
<br />
Verant really needs to get less anal about this &quot;controlling the rate at which these items appear&quot; thing.  The stupid Ragefire camp causes more grief to its customers than any army of epic-wielding clerics could ever possibly do.<br />
<br />
Now, taking a step back...<br />
<br />
I'm not nearly as rabid as the above might make me sound.  I've more-or-less resigned myself to the five-month wait.  And EQ offers me much enjoyment outside of my epic.  I certainly am not about to launch a crusade over this issue, or do anything subversive regarding the Ragefire list - I do think that it's the best that can be made out of a bad situation.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to vent a little.  That's what Rant forums are for, neh?  ^_^<br />

Though I have fielded many concerns, people now understand why I refuse to waste my time and my guild's time in a fruitless quest for an unnecesary item.  I dont expect Verant cares about my attitude, but after playing this game for over 3 years I just want to have fun.  The last time I was on a list was the heyday of SolB back on Mith Marr.  I left my list days long ago, and have no desire to go back to them.  So I am content with what I have now, and just play the game to have fun (not the phat lewts).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aricon</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a few things to say on the Ragefire List. <br />
<br />
Good things about it.......<br />
well if you see things my way after i say what I have to say you'll see why I have very little good to say. <br />
<br />
I've played EQ for almost 2 full years now, and in doing so I've seen uber guilds PL classes they decide they may need later or at the moment. I've seen Beastlord's hit lvl 60 and get there epics in 3 weeks. Uber guild Clerics go from lvl 1 to mid to high 50s in 5 or 6 weeks and get their epics. (yes before the list) So some of us have reasons for disliking the list. I'm a lvl 60 paladin on Drinal, no not a cleric, but i know people on the list that have been on EQ for years with a cleric as their main that they spend all their time on, staying with a guild not quite strong enough to just knock out the epics and move on. I see now a device were Uber guilds can move their alt clerics up in lvls and throw them on a list infront of several other people. See the list gives em a time to wait. No ones gonna just sit there with an alt they only use for rezzing every now and then to camp a 5 day spawn........but someone who has waited and put their hearts into a character will find a way to get the piece and complete it without such a list.<br />
Some may say move on to and uber guild...its a game. It may be but for those of you that guild hop I have little respect for you. It is a game, but it reviels a players character. If you are greedy enough to use people in the game, then you are greedy enough to use someone in real life.<br />
<br />
Think about it. All this list does it make it easier to give PLed clerics a place in time to camp ragefire and gives the whole server that doesn't see thru it another way to yell KS at someone and damage their names.<br />
<br />
Will I go by the list for those I know..... sure, unless I see rage fire just walking around, then my friends hes just a spawn. The list will no longer exist to me.<br />

I've built my name around doing people justly and helping people as much as i can. If you don't see this the way I do thats life, We all have oppinions, just some of us take em to the boards, and some of us make a list. <br />
<br />
Maybe if i decide to do my epic I should start a list and place myself in there on the 1st or 4th mob spawn so I know i can get the spawns when i have time or when i need to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badkarma</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should try Bertoxx, been playing there sence the server started no list there eather and no chance for a small guild cleric to get his epic, the moment the mob pops you have 3 or 4 of the largest guilds on the server nukeing it.<br />
<br />
Epic by 2003 for me?  no chance in hell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or we can use the list, which means that some clerics will have to wait months for their epics.<br />
<br />
I know you won't be happy waiting, but Ragefire doesn't spawn any faster just because you decide to take him when you want to.  There will still be months of waiting for many cleric epics.<br />
<br />
There will be clerics that have to wait either by decision to stay on a list, or simply because they get KSed or can't gather the troops at the right time.<br />
<br />
I hate lists myself, but because there is a list, all it does is show how many people are waiting one way or another to get it.  It doesn't shorten the list of clerics that need it by not having one, only makes it so that everyone is fighting over the spawn at the same time.  Still with only one winner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niphreedil</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 09:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sympathize with you Monual, and I guess Morinkhan will sympathize with me, since I'm soon going to be number 75th or so on the MT list.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Does it mean I will wait for summer 2003 to get my epic ? Yes.<br />
<br />
The list is the best way to waste only the cleric's time. Only him has to camp the spawn, and he does that when his turn has come, not before. That means I can fight other mobs with my friends in the meantime, as do other guilds. No competition = no time wasted, more loot and fun for everyone.<br />
<br />
If you absolutely wanted your epic, at all price, then either<br />
. you started playing after other clerics who feel the same and I'd say first come first served, or<br />
. you started playing before them and then why didn't you apply to an ubber guild ? To keep your friends and have fun ?<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that VI created that situation, so it's all their fault. Having a list is one way to minimize the time everyone waste on this camp.<br />
Now, if you like to fight mobs then help maintain the list. If you like to fight players, go FFA.<br />
<br />
I wish I know why VI doesn't want more cleric epics to enter the game. Yes, it's powerful, but is it really overpowered ?<br />
<br />

<br />
If you are in a small guild, you at least have an idea of when your turn will come by using the list.  Now as long as no one decides to just take a spawn in that time, you should get your shot.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the whole Ragefire issue is stupid.  Verant should have done something to fix it long ago.  Until they do make some changes, I won't even start the epic process.<br />

<br />
However, new AA abilities and spells are making the Almighty Clicker much less powerful than it once was.<br />
<br />
Yes, nothing beats mana-less rezzes, especially for a big raiding guild... but to be honest, with modrod2, gather mana, c3, AE buffs and all the FT items and effects in the game now, recovering from a wiped raid isn't anywhere near as big an ordeal as it once was.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong =)... It's still an enormously handy epic, but it's not nearly as overwhelmingly powerful as it was a year or two ago.<br />

I suggest you drop the stupid list and make on that is in order by who played the longest, and you will eliminate uber guild PL clerics and alt clerics from even trying to rob a REAL cleric of having his epic in a decent amount of time.<br />
<br />
You can say well someone could just leave their alt cleric online at night a log him the next day, sure. You still won't catch up with the time real clerics starting from nothing put into thier characters. People are going tolog them to raid with thier guilds with their main characters anyways.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glornn</div><div class="date">08-03-2002, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the current epic is &quot;too powerful&quot; and thus it is necessary to regulate the flow of them into the game, why don't they make some sort of pre-epic weapon for clerics?  So, when a cleric becomes rage-ready and they are unable ot gather the force needed or have to wait for years on a list, they can take down some other more commonly spawning mob and turn in the items for a dumbed down epic.  Similar stats with a different effect like aego or something.  Then, when the cleric's turn rolls around or they final have enough people they can do ragefire and trade in the pre-epic and rage piece for the rez stick.  I know I'll never have the time/fire power to get a rez stick, but it should would be nice to get a sweet weapon for all the time I've spent doing the other parts of the quest.  Just a thought.</div></div><hr />
