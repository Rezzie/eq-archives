<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xthor</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, for those of you annoyed by people that think Clerics *have* to perform rezzes, let me tell you, the mindset starts early.<br />
<br />
Last night I was playing for a few minutes and saw a shout asking &quot;What does anon mean&quot;?  They got the correct answer, so to be funny, I shouted (yes, I should have just shut up and not clogged the channel) &quot;It means 1) a newbie found the anon button, or 2) some high-level person doesn't want to be begged for spells&quot;  Ok, I thought it was funny.  <br />
<br />
Somebody immediately shouted back &quot;Nobody should be looked down on for wanting to be paid for casting spells.  The only people that HAVE to cast a spell on you is a cleric if you ask to be healed!&quot;  What?  Granted, I play a Cleric so I can heal people...I think it's fun.  But I HAVE to heal people if they ask?  I'm sorry, I've been grouped (even at my lowly level 9) and not had the spare mana to deal with anybody outside of my group.  I don't see that I HAVE to spend it to keep anyone other than my group alive.  If I have spare, sure, I'd love to heal other people, but the attitude really surprised me.<br />
<br />
So....next time somebody tells you you HAVE to give them a res....  I guess that's just the life of a cleric.  And they've been thinking that for a long time...  ::shrug::</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seliris</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually got in a VERY huge arguement in Greater Spamdark the other day along those same lines.<br />
<br />
Someone shouted that high level characters should help any newbie they see.<br />
<br />
Now, I help quite a few people, but help, to me, is not something that is requested, but something that is given.<br />
<br />
So I pointed out that even as a 40+ cleric, I will gladly watch someone die if they EXPECT me to bail em out.<br />
<br />
And immediately I recieved a slurry of tells/shouts on how I was a terrible cleric and how I shouldnt play one and yadda yadda..<br />
<br />
I calmly pointed out that I help when I feel like it, and nowhere am I responsible to anyone unless in my group. I also pointed out that it is anyones choice to help.<br />
<br />
Eventually the screams subsided and they all saw my point.. that it is a choice to help others, and I'll gladly choose to if said person is in need, not &quot;Hey look! A lvl 43 cleric, we can pull by him, he'll keep us alive&quot;<br />
<br />
Fool me once, shame on you........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I would have said something like...<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, a cleric HAS to heal you - but you have to drop whatever you're doing to do whatever any cleric wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
As far as the guy who said that high level characters should help newbies...<br />
<br />
I want the names of his high level characters, then I'm gonna start a new 1st level character.  I need planar armor.  And he should help me, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I have been lurking around here for a while and read lots of god posts (thanks to everyone making it a great board).<br />
<br />
I have seen that attitude. Sitting at the docs in FP waiting for the boat. Talking to a cleric in full planes armor drooling some over it etc. Up comes a naked level 1 newbie (anonym of course) starting up as follows:<br />
<br />
Newbie00: Can I get that shield you are wearing?<br />
Cleric: No, it is no drop.<br />
Newbie00: Oh, can I get that armor then.<br />
Cleric: No, this is planes armor, it is also no drop.<br />
Newbie00: Then can you give me any spare planes armor that you have in the bank?<br />
Cleric: No drop means that you have to loot it yourself.<br />
Newbie00: Oh, can you take me to the planes then so I can loot some?<br />
<br />
At this point I am starting to burn of some fuses, beeing only level 35 at the time and had a few beggars on me (including the beggars that think that powerleveling is included in a clerics duties, &quot;You have atone dont you?&quot;) that I start to tell what I think about his begging.<br />
<br />
May Brell strengthen you arms and guide your weapons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aanar</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my guild got into a little bit of a scrap over the lower levels expecting help from the highers.  We got it worked out though =).  They know they have to ask nicely now for help because even amongst real life friends expecting help grates on people.<br />
<br />
That being said, noone ever remembers me for the free rezzes I do except for my guildmates and our allied guilds.  This is along the lines of all the low-lifes who promise if you need anything, they'll help you.<br />
<br />
So basically, I enjoy helping guildmates and allies.  Everyone makes enemies, or at least people on less than chummy chummy terms eventually.  These are the people you screwed you once and if they ever ask for help you laugh.<br />
<br />
But the majority of people are neutral - neither friend nor foe.  I've given up on free rezzes for you guys.  Maybe if I'm feeling charitable, I'll offer one.  Otherwise I accept platinum, fbss, yaks, and other nice things.  If you can find a cleric for free, bless your soul, leave me alone.  And yes I've turned down 150pp one zone away becuase I deemed it not worth my time.  I figure if I ever need cash, I could go to Rathe and kill 5-6 giants an hour for 150pp.  So especially with Kunark, the 100pp per zone  only seems right.<br />
<br />
Maybe after enough clerics get as tired as me over this, we'll actually start being paid our due.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Begging seems to be more prevalent of late when in cities. I think the /beg /duel commands should be combined. You can either give them goodies.... or a nuke or two.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Thank you!  Oh my god, I had forgotten that time way in the past...<br />
<br />
Some 8th ot 9th newbie was begging me non-stop and simply would not leave me alone.  So I finally agreed to if he would duel me.  He agreed so I told him to meet me by the gates in Freeport.<br />
<br />
I did teh /duel and he accepted and I waited patiently.  He finally tired of waiting and attacked me.<br />
<br />
Of course the guards cut him down in an instant.<br />
<br />
He reappeared at the newbie spawn point 70 feet away, sans a half a bub of exp.  When he returned I gave him 10 coppers, told him to never beg like that from anyone again, threw him on ignore and went my merry way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xthor</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a 9th level newbie, I can say that that's harsh.  But VERY funny.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I've never hit that &quot;Beg&quot; button and intend to keep my begging skill at zero unless there's some compelling reason somebody can tell me to raise it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saara</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, all I can say, is that the server really dictates the behaviour of others. While still on Xegony, there was not a day went by that I was not harassed or scolded by some beggar wanting my equipment, powerlevelling, cash etc. It had gotten so bad, that I hated to go to any zone where there were lower level people. Since moving to 7th Hammer, I have encountered 2 beggars in weeks filled with many hours of playing. It is so nice to sit in front of Neriak, unanon, and not be harassed  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
This may all just be due to the fact that the population is so wonky right now. There are quite a few people level 40+, and a ton of newbies, but very few people between 20-40. <br />
<br />
So, while I can definately relate to the beggar syndrome, I am very pleased that I no longer have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
(Not to mention it's great to take a group down to Lower Guk and be the only 6 people in the zone  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif )<br />
