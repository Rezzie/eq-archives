</FONT><HR><BR>During my reflections on yesteryear, I remember fondly dinging 39.<P>I was in Burning Woods I do believe... fighting with the brave warrior Creolen.   Well I thought he was brave... but he had never faced a Complete Healing cleric like me before.<P>I had never used CH in combat at this point.  I cast it once I think, to try and see just how long 10s was.   But never in combat.   I had heard how amazing this spell was... how it was going to change my life... save lives and water my lawn.   But now the time has come to test that theory.<P>Our brave band over thrill seekers headed to Burning Woods... there, we grabbed ourself a wurm to play with.   Creo engaged the mob, and started "Start your heal now!".   I was like "I cant yet... you're not around half... gotta make it efficent, this spell costs a lot of mana"<P>So then he's around 2 bubbles... and crying like a little baby.. HEAL HEAL HEAL!!!<P>I honestly don't remember if I pulled off a dang close CH... or he died that night... I just remember the warrior who showed no fear in the past (or in the future), crying.<P>Whats your first CH story?   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Technically.. my first Complete Heal was on myself. I buffed myself and then wrathed myself down to one bubble. I then complete healed myself for about 1000 hp.<P>My first real CH experience was in Overthere during 39. My subject was a Dark Elf warrior, who had about 1800 hp. He was level 41 so he wasn't losing HP too fast, and I really had no problem CHing him. My first few CHs were at 2 bubs and went through fine. At the encouragement of the group I started doing my CHs at 1 1/2 and it was fine as well.<P>After a few more groups in OT I dinged 40 and spent some time in EC or Lower Guk. My CH experiences there were good as well, although I did much more trading then grouping. My first bad CH experience was in Dreadlands. Things hit harder in DL then in Overthere. I was doing fine healing our tank at 1 1/2 - 2 bubs. When we had two mobs on us, and the bard's charm was resisted.. well that 1 1/2 bubs of health goes down very fast. During the 10 seconds of my CH, I see the ogre fall down. Whoops.<P>Luckily he wasn't mad    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>After this, my CH motto became: You live,  you learn, and then you rez. <P>The one thing I learned about this is that you must consider the number of mobs your tank has. When its two, its probably a good idea to heal closer to two, then one. <P>------------------<BR><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=42628" TARGET=_blank>Quotison Iachwer</A></B><BR>42nd Level Dwarven Cleric<BR>Tarew Marr Server<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Quotison (edited 01-25-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I really didnt use CH until I got to about level 50 too.  I usually group with my friends, none of which are a warrior.  I finally started using it when I realized that I can finally give a monk or a paladin enough HP to make it pretty effecient.<P>I really have only had 2 experiences that were close.  One was on my fiancee's pally.  She had 2 or 3 HGs and a cyclops (derailing someones train onto us) and the CH hit her with like 50hp left.  Yes, she was screaming at me from across the room.<P>My other close experience was with my monk buddy where he pulled 2 coterie in Tenebrous.  Heh, they were tapping (or harm touching, whichever it is) him like mad.  I landed CH with him at about 40hp.  He throught I was asleep at the wheel.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>-Thorphin Madntyre<BR> Vicar of Noble Dreams<BR>  ~Solusek Ro<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I had 48 Warrior crying like a little girl with CH once.<P>We were in Lguk just getting exp, full group too, there was my regular hunting partner a 45 warrior at the time, a 48 warrior, a 55 SK, a 41 Wiz, and a 45 pally.  For some reason the mobs liked the 48 warrior for this one pull, she was not even pulling.  I guess she was not used to having a cleric with CH to back her up.  She just started to Spam in group chat "HEAL!!! HEAL!!! HEAL!!" while she was just at half life.  The worst part of it was her hp's were not dropping that fast.  It was a good 20 seconds till I had to cast CH on her.  And I still hit her with over a bub of life left.<P>She then decided I was too much of a rogue cleric for her and she left the group shortly afterwords.  Since then, we have group a lot cause she saw how the whole CH spells works while I was using it on my hunting partner.  I still laugh at her everytime she gets agro.  I even cast heal on her after a half bub. That is if I am FM and have clarity.<P>------------------<BR>Stewbing<BR>47 Dwarf Cleric<BR>Office of FpH<BR>The Rathe Server<BR>"A real friend is not the one that bails you out of jail.

Had a group of 3 or 4 a troll warrior was tanking and we had a few adds.  I don't recall his name but I started casting Cheal on him when he was at about 2.5 bubbles (without a macro) and he stayed in there swinging with out even a peep.  My Cheal landed when his bar turned purple and he dropped.  He popped back up and kept swinging. I was sweating bullets.<P>Later another tank joined us and was using the "HEAL!" when he got down to 3 bubbles and the troll warrior told him to "shut up the cleric won't let you die."

</FONT><HR>I gotta go with this one.<P>My first Complete heal was right after I got the spell. Here I was, barely 39, and my friend, who plays an ogre warrior, was 45. we were fighting at a spire in South Karana, just a small group of guildmates and friends.<P>When I joined the set, Thok knew I had just gotten my new spells. The first time I started to heal him with Superior Heal, he got mad at me and told me he had too many hitpoints, I HAD to use complete on him.<P>So, here we are, fighting 5 gnolls. His hitpoints are dropping, not very fast, but like a rock to someone who has never cast a ten second spell. Ronalin (paly) had used his lay hands about 20 minutes ago, the druid was AFK, the mage only had bandages, and I'm scared ****less. Thok tells me not to worry, if he dies I can ressurect him. (Ah, the days of pre-kunark, when a 39 res was actually acceptable to some people....) Finally, I can't take it any more, and I start casting CH when he hits half. I'm staring at my cast bar, counting the seconds, sweatting bullets when compared to his health, and he was barely reaching berserk.

</FONT><HR>I just made 39 a few weeks ago, and since my tanks are a wood elf warrior and an iksar shadowknight (39 and 35 respectively) I hesitated to use CH.  I finally decided that if ALL my buffs were on them it was just barely mana efficient.  We were fighting in the lower levels of ToFS, which is pretty darn safe, so I started practicing.  I wait till the berserk message on the warrior, and 2 bubs on the sk.  I've not lost either yet, but I've had a couple hit while they were purple ;p when we moved to Mistmoore. So far they've not freaked, but then we've been hunting together for 2 years too.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I'm pretty sure the SK feigned during one CH though <laugh><P>Serenya Soulhealer<BR>40th circle of Brell, the Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I had it in my packs when I dinged 39.  As I recall I used it once or twice during that group before camping for the night, not very effectively.<P>I spent much of 39 grinding in dreadlands.  I found that CH was good fun, and if you compare Complete to super healing you might as well complete heal if you are going to get 1000 hit points back, after that it is all a bonus.  I was complete healing a 45 ranger who was tanking for a while (good tank, did better than the 42 warrior we had).<P>I do normally give a /g watchin %t to let the backup healers know that I have an eye on the main tank and have not gone afk on them.  That cuts down on the panic'd tank whines.<P>The fun bit with complete heal came at level 40.  At level 40 you can get experience grouped with folks who are up to level 60.  I know, I went and hung out with friends in Maiden's Eye.  Warrior 60, shaman 60, bard 60, rogue 57, monk 53 and me, cleric 40.  Complete heal does WONDERS on a Warlord.  At least one of those heals was for 4 and 3/4 bubbles of health too.  (we trained ourselves, it was ugly)<P>I expect to use complete a lot between now and level 44.  I hope to get good at the timing, because I don't expect to use it as much after I get celestial healing.  <P>Lynet Beaumains, The Damosel Savage</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I dinged 39 in Ogguk as well.  The people I was playing with at the time told me CH was very dangerous and I shouldn't bother memorizing it.  Well...I met a warrior there a few days later and we grouped together to do the guards just the two of us.  After a couple pulls he asked me why I wasn't using CH.  I told him what my friends had said, and he then explained to me the value of CH...and told me to start using it.<P>That warrior let me practice CH on him for several hours...and HE was the one that would say "wait longer..don't even start til I'm around a bubble of health to maximize the heal".  Needless to say, I became very very good at estimating healtimes and damage, and yeah..I loved scaring people with it in group exp times (teehee).<P>I miss that.  Nowadays..like someone pointed out...most mobs hit too hard to fool around with it anymore...I'm much more conservative.  Or maybe it's just old age.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Arele" TARGET=_blank>Arele Nyxx</A> - <BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org" TARGET=_blank>Afterlife</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Gee I can't remember my first use of Cheal...prolly wasn't that memerable. I read about some peoples "close calls"...how's this one. We were doing Skele captain in Karnors..tough camp at the bast of times. I was aout lvl 54ish at the time. We had a minor train and the poor ole bard seemed to be wearing the most of it. I started the Cheal when he was at a little unde half health, but then I realised that he was dropping a little faster than expected. The heal hit when he was unconsious and the purple was about half gone. He went from lying on the ground to being upright and full health in about .5 of a second.
