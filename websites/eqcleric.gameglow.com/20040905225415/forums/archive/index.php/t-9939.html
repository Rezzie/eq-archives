<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozymandia</div><div class="date">09-04-2001, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I have a 25 cleric on Cazic-Thule server.  I had her on the shelf for a few months while I gathered equipment for her.  Finally I get her re-outfitted and head for SK.<br />
<br />
I'm shouting in SK for a group, no takers.  After about 20 minutes, I get invited into a Paw group.  I was 23 at the time.  Yes, that was very low for the dungeon, but they said that the 29 shammy would heal if I would chain-stun, so I thought that would be cool.  Once I hit 24, they said, I could take over heals because I would have Greater Healing then.<br />
<br />
So for about 3 hours we're killing gnolls in Paw.  It's going great, no one even comes near to dying.  I top off heals when we're resting.  Finally we invite this 30 rogue into the group, and we're killing more stuff just fine.<br />
<br />
The shammy has to leave, finally.  I say &quot;ok, I hit 24 in 3 blues, and then I'll have Greater Heal and everything will be fine.  We'll be ok until then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next thing I know, I'm reading the rogue's words: &quot;I'm not gonna pull cuz we don't have a good healer.&quot;  Um, excuse me?  I'm your ONLY healer, and I can keep you alive until I hit 24 in oh, about half an hour.  But nope, he wasn't having it.  So I disbanded and left, telling them they could put a &quot;good healer&quot; in my spot.  An hour later I was in SK at the spires and still seeing one of them shouting for a healer for a Paw group.<br />
<br />
Later that night, I'm grouped at North Spire.  We're doing great, I've hit 24 and am Greater Healing with impunity.  After about 2 hours, the main tank has to leave.  We're getting ready to shout for a new tank, when the shammy (who was level 31) says, &quot;I have a 35 cleric coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
What the hell??  I'm keeping everyone healed quite nicely, thank you, and this putz wants a 35 cleric who will get crappy exp grouping with them?  Needless to say I felt I was being kicked out of the group again and left.<br />
<br />
What is up with these people???  I'm a kick-ass little cleric, I do my job well.  They all saw that, and they still think I suck.  /sigh<br />

Having a healer that's too low is a bad thing.  I understand you were close to getting more heals and I might have been more liberal because of that, but I wouldn't expect everyone to be.<br />
<br />
As far as the second case goes, I agree with you.  You shouldn't need 2 Clerics in most xp groups.  If the current Cleric isn't good enough, then replace him, don't add another.  Clerics rarely deal any damage....that's 2 slots out of 6 that aren't doing any damage.  I prefer more damage output than that.<br />

Even though it's hard, don't let it dishearten you, yesterday, I was in Karnor's Castle, we needed an extra tank, so I let the partyleader know, I'll go outside to Dreadlands to shout for a tank for us as a favour to him. Suddenly, I was around the zoneline, and I get jumped by at least 5 doggies, stun, hit, hit, hit, hit, stun, hit, stun, needless to say, I bit it. I was 48 at the time, and wanted to see if I could get a 49 ress, I ended up getting one in 5 mins, but by the time I got back to the group, I was replaced by a 51 cleric. I was fuming.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/mad.gif It's stupid things like these that ruin your day. So, I feel your pain.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Advert</div><div class="date">09-05-2001, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say that I don't mind another cleric in the group...with two clerics u can chain stun a mob during the fight and u will not have to cast any heals ..since the mob is just standing there playing a statue.<br />
and u can pull alot faster if u and the other cleric know how to work as a team..<br />
u will never have to take a breake for mana ....<br />
And u can have some fun and get that melee skill points up a bit  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
but then again an extra &quot;bad&quot; cleric can make a group fail alot.<br />
<br />
and for the rogue that said he'll not pull because of u being low...ask him to xxx  a low lev rogue doesn't have that many HP so a 100hp heal will do fine unless u are very unlucky, u just have to cast the heal alot more..and there is something called mana check before each pull.. <br />

I've seen crap clerics at high levels. I've seen awesome lower levels clerics who can do amazing things with what they got. That's what it all about: working what you got and not worrying about what you ain't. If a battle ends with my tanks more than 4 bubs of life and me at 40m, I figure I'm doing ok. Sounds like you were doing ok, too. Especially in that second group. Be proud of your work!<br />
<br />
As far as 2 clerics, frankly, I love having another cleric in my group. Chain stun is terrific and its always a bonus to have back-up healing. I work often with a partner. Our motto before every hunt: &quot;No One Dies&quot; and we stick to it.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozymandia</div><div class="date">09-05-2001, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's why I was angry with the rogue situation.  We had a 30 wizzie, 30 rogue, 26 warrior, 29 ranger, and the druid had just left the group.  Hence without me the only healer they had was a ranger.  Not to knock rangers, of course, but ... we had a rockin' group and we would have been fine.  I'm satisfied enough in my healing skills to know that.  The group did hellacious damage and the gnolls didn't last long as it was /shrug<br />
<br />
With the spire group, I was mostly annoyed that a 35 cleric was coming.  I mean, you can still get exp at the spires in the low 30's but it's veeery slow (I have a high level main, so I do know whereof I speak).  It seemed ridiculous to me to bring a 35 cleric from wherever just to add to a group that didn't need it /shrug again</div></div><hr />

Like they say, don't let it get you down. This doesn't have anything to do with your ability it is to do with their mentality. Keep your confidence and go rock on with somebody else  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
