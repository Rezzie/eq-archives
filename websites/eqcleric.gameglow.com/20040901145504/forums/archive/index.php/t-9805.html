Though I could eb wrong but in my experience the only non-evil city I can enter is Freeport, but not north. If there is a quest beyond Solsek for De Clerics, someone let me know !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzin</div><div class="date">03-09-2000, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you can do most the quest in the Hall of the Dead (necro/sk guild), but you are right, our guild gives out no quest itself. However, then fun just starts....that observer staff, forget it unless you a) create a newbie gnome to complete it for you. b) throw roleplaying an EVIL priest (or priestess) of Hate out the window and go on a mission to raise your faction in the good cities (this counts for 90% of the nice cleric quest out there). Warning, this will be difficult to do with out ruining your faction in Neriak, but I have heard it can be done c) buy the quest items from some one. Or d) say &quot;screw it&quot; and enjoy being EVIL. After all, you were warned when creating the char that it was a high difficulty combination.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have never tried to raise my &quot;goody goody&quot; factions. In fact, for quite a few, I have gone out of my way to harm them (here, erolisi sisters, allow me to show you how weak &quot;love&quot; is.(Strangely enough, these followers of &quot;Love&quot; sure do Hate me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif )). My only gripe is, short of the Thex Mallet, there is no quest we as dak elves can do, that the &quot;good&quot; races can not do (not, I said do, not return an item they can not use. Example Lynuga's rubies. Supposed to be a dark race only quest, but with the old mask of the deceiver or wolf form it can be done by them). Ah, well, I ramble. Basically, suck it up, enjoy being a Dark Elf (we are the BEST race out there, after all) and say &quot;screw&quot; the quests  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
