This control panel is used for performing all of the administrative actions for the bulletin board.  Authorized users can set the moderators for the forums, set member permissions, and edit/prune messages.  If you are setting up your bulletin board for the first time (and you did not have someone install it for you), be sure to follow our <A HREF="http://www.ultimatebb.com/home/instructions.shtml" target=_blank>detailed instructions</A>.
<p>
Let's get our definitions straight...

<TD valign=top>
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Administrators have total control over every aspect of the bulletin board.  They are, in essence, the owners of the board.  Thus, administrator status should only be conveyed to trusted individuals. Most boards have only one owner or administrator.
<p>
You may grant administrative power to as many users as you please, however.  Only Administrators can grant/remove admin authority. 
<p>
Administrators are able to set moderators for each forum, set permissions for any registered user, create announcements and digests, create forums and archives, email registered users, and edit/delete messages.

<TD valign=top>
<FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Moderators are the ringleaders for each forum.  Each forum can have up to four moderators, but one person may be a moderator in multiple forums.  An administrator may also be a moderator.
<p>
Moderators have the ability to edit/remove messages from their particular forum(s) and create announcements in their particular forum(s).  They can also create/update the search index.  They cannot change permissions for a particular users, however.  Only administrators can change user permissions.
