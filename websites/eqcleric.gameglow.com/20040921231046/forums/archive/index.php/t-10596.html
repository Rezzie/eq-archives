<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roechek</div><div class="date">05-16-2000, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After spending a week in Unrest, I finally hit level 30. This week I find I don't have as much time to play, and when I do, it's only for an hour or so at a time. And worse, I'm playing very early in the morning (this morning, Unrest had 6 people in it). <br />
<br />
I'm wondering if someone can give me a strategy and perhaps nearby place to solo when I only have an hour to play. If I could pull solo mobs, I could kill just about anything in the house. But we all know that ain't gonna happen.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I am considering soloing Tidal Lords outside in Dagnors, if I can't find a group in Unrest. They're blue, and it'll take a lot of them to get any significant exp, but it may be my only option.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts? Thanks!<br />

I am in a similar situation, in that I play for a short period of time.  I would suggest giant skellies in Rathe Mountains.  I know it isn't nearby Unrest, but it is nice for the situation you described.  <br />
<br />
Looking at a map (for example, the one from www.eqatlas.com) (http://www.eqatlas.com))  you will see a bowl-like area that contains the Lake Rathe zone.  This is one area where gs spawn.  Other's spawn by the hill giant area.  I started near the necro tower (I forget which *grob it was) and as I became confident, started circling the bowl. Just don't pull to the LR zone.  Med up on the hillside.  It was so safe, I would leave Leo there medding while I ate dinner, did other things  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
The spawn table for gs seems to include the lizards (all types), bears (all types) and cyclops. So if you don't see any giant skellies, kill a few lizzies and bears.  If too many cyclops appear, go to the hg area and kill gs for a while, then return.  The actual area doesn't look like a bowl, because there is a plateau in the center.  GS sometimes spawn up there.<br />
<br />
It was great because I could sense undead to locate my victim.  Hit it with dismiss undead, run to the spot I had chosen for the kill, fear my victim, root, expel until root broke, repeat.  <br />
<br />
I think I can still get xp from them at 32.<br />

There is also a great demand for clerics in the Frontier Mountains.  I expect that I can stay in this area for many, many levels.<br />

<br />
Most of the sarnaks are still blue now, even greens are exp giving at 30.<br />

I have found South Karana a good spot. The players at the paw spires are normaly looking for a cleric and don't care if you will only be there for a short time.<br />
  Another place is the Centuar village, you can solo archers and courser with no problems. The centuars have no faction hit but they will help each other. The foals and sheltie wont join your fights but archers and stronger will. <br />
  You can also just walk around the zone and find blues to kill. This method is best done with a druid or ranger to track but can be done solo.<br />
  Inside the paw zone is a good spot if you can break up the 2 in the first room. The zone line is only a few steps away. I do this by enstilling one then fighting the other, zone after the fight med and return to finish the second. After these 2 there are 3 more but you can only see 2 so be careful. I don't suggest doing those unless you are very good. <br />
  This also puts you within a few zones of Rathe Mtns and the giant skellies. Kill the lizards to get the skellies to pop.<br />
Best of Luck and hope this helps.<br />

<br />
So, what Suesc said is very good advice.  I'd try that out.<br />
