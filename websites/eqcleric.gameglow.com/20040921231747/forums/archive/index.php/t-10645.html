You need at least 1 good high AC Main tank. Warrior is best, Pallie or SK will do in a pinch, I would only take Ranger or Monk if I Had to.<br />
<br />
Add as many other melee classes as you can, and possibly a bard or an enchanter, or maybe a secondary healer with some good buffs.<br />
<br />
Your main downtime will be from your mana supply. Be sure to remind the tanks to try to let the main high ac tank keep as much damage on him as possible. Not always easy to do, but if it can be done, it helps a ton.<br />
<br />
Keep all 3 buff lines up, if the cost for symbol bugs ya, ask if you could have a small amount of the loot to cover the cost.<br />
<br />
I usually heal at about 50% on most tanks, on all but warriors this brings them to full. <br />
<br />
Great XP, decent loot (Cash and weapons to sell.)<br />
<br />
In the current days with overcrowding the way it is, this is a nice place to hunt, and you are not too far from lower guk or CT if you want to travel a bit.<br />

I am assuming Meddik was speaking literally about zoning into Ogguk zone and fighting the guards there. <br />
<br />
How about Ogre bouncers?  Are they easier or harder or same?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

On Tunare, they've been camped even more religiously than the gate guards of south Freeport.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt the place is as good XP any more, and probably longer spawn times, more difficult kills.<br />
