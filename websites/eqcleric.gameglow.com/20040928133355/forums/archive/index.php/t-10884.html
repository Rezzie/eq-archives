<br />
last weekend we tried Lord Yelinak several times, but failed all the time, so Rallos still hasn´t beaten him.<br />
On our best try we got him down to the &quot;L&quot; in &quot;Lord Yelinak&quot;, but then 20 people went LD at the same time and we lost  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Are there any special strategies? We had 4 Wizzies with Dragonbane, might we need more? We also didn´t want to have too many people due to lag issues - I think the most we had was around 50 (dunno for sure) on the best try, but as I said before, several went LD then.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />

<br />
I know he's been attempted numerous times on Fennin Ro, but I don't believe that anyone's been able to take him down.  They always seem to have a large number of LD's during the fight... I've heard mention of his LD attack  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

If you are having problems with lots of Linkdeads, you MUST MAKE SURE PEOPLE SET THEIR DATARATE.TXT file.<br />
<br />
It defaults to 5.0, even with a rock solid DSL, zero PL, you WILL go LD in a 50 man raid.<br />
<br />
If you use a modem, set it to 7.0 or 9.0<br />
<br />
If you have a DSL, CABLE, or T1+ set it to at least 12.0  <br />
<br />
Basically the datarate.txt is the value at which the server will arbitrarly disconnect you if you pull more data than is set in that file.   On raids I regularly spike at over 9000 transfer rate, which is why I have mine set at 15.0 and almost never go LD (I have a 384kbit dsl connection).<br />

I'm on a pretty speedy cable modem though...</div></div><hr />

Yes, we had a lot of people with us but we'd had them each and every time.  This time, Dragonsbane did it for us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">07-12-2001, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they said that over 9.0 was not recommended, and over 20.0 was ignored. It probably counts as 20.0, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">07-12-2001, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verant also said &quot;Rangers are balanced&quot; and &quot;Spells are dropping.&quot;<br />
<br />
I ran mine at 50.0, never had a problem.  Actually once we where fighting down to Trakanon and another guild was also massing at the entrance to come down to trak, over 120 people in zone.    The second group decides to mass camp to clear agro (back when entrance to seb was so horribly bugged), Anyway when they all logged back in my transfer rate spiked at 35,000.   I was one of 2 people that did not go link dead.  Had a value of 20.0 or higher been ignored, I would have gone linkdead, and since my connect hit 35,000 I'm pretty sure 35.0 will work too.<br />
<br />
The idea behind the datarate.txt is to pervent people on slow modems from getting blasted with more data than they possibly can handle.  Personally I'd rather have my connection determine when I go LD instead of some arbitrary value set too low in my Datarate.txt file.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">07-12-2001, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would guess that the reason Verant doesn't want you setting Datarate.txt over 9 has more to do with their capacity to send data than your capacity to receive it.<br />
<br />
Imagine a raid situation with 100 people in a zone, all with datarate.txt set to 50. The transfer rate peaks at 35,000. What happens next?<br />

<br />
35,000 is only 35k/sec.    During patch times I regularly download the files from the patch program at 100k/sec.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Sony Online Entertainment on Bandwidth:<br />
At peak, we are using approximately 1 Gbps of bandwidth. The data rate per user is something we can control, so we know the direct correlation of number of simultaneous users to bandwidth. It has, of course, grown as our user base has grown, but the surprise is more from the user-base size, not the bandwidth.<br />
<br />
The article also states 80000 users during peak hours. 1 Gbps / 80000 users = 12.5 kbps per user. 60, 70 people spiking at 50 kbps won't affect overall bandwidth demand by much.<br />
<br />
Verant saying they can control datarate per user is also very interesting...</div></div><hr />

We do him with 40 something quite regularly, usually with 2 or 3 dragonbanes. It's a question of having casters avoid aoe (for example last Yelinak kill the aoe never touched me) and melee just surviving (which is basically a question of agro control). Oh and before people act stupid I'm not using any kind of exploits to avoid the aoe, just common sense... ie 'tactics'  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seethur</div><div class="date">08-13-2001, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you cant kill him with 4 dbs you guys should reconsider any strategies you are using. Our first yelinak kill we killed him with 0 DBs and it took about 8mins of fighting. Now we have 4DBs and he dies in about 3mins 45 seconds</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozzn</div><div class="date">08-14-2001, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DO NOT set your datarate.txt file just according to your connection speed!  What this file does is tell the system how much data to try to give you in a small amount of time.  If you run on an old system (&lt; 500mhz) and have the data rate set to anything greater then 7-8 you'll probably have issues.  <br />
<br />
I have a 400 mhz system and a very strong cable modem line and if my datarate is set to 7 I go LD.  Since I changed it from 9 to 6 though I have NOT gone link dead on any raid, unless the zone has come down.  <br />
<br />
Verant also said to not set the number abouve 9.0.  Doing so might help if you have a very strong system but I have freinds with cable and great systems and do large raids with everything on and there datarate is only set to 9.  Anything above that is over kill.<br />
<br />
Here is an old post I had on another board with some more suggestions to avoid going LD.<br />
Most of this is common since.<br />
<br />
Make 2 eqcleint.ini files, one that is normal day to day and one for raids. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. In the raid eqcleint.ini file setup the following lines like this<br />
LoadArmor17=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor18=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor19=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor20=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor21=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor22=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor23=FALSE<br />
<br />
2. Stuff you know<br />
ShowSpellEffects=0<br />
ServerFilter=1(Don't do this as a cleric, get a better system you just can't wait 6 seconds to see health bars move.)<br />
<br />
3. Video Settings<br />
UseD3DTextureCompression=TRUE<br />
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16<br />
<br />
4. In the Display settings in the game<br />
Sky = 3d Sky off<br />
Particle Density off<br />
PC Names = off<br />
Level of Detail = off<br />
MIP Map = on (If you video card does this. It will dramatically slow down your zone load times but helps lag once in the zone.)<br />
<br />
5. BIOS<br />
Check your BIOS, and fiddle with the setting called AGP Aperture size. Make sure its higher than 16MB. I found that the best setting for me was 256MB (usually it is good at around half of your total Ram, but it varies from computer to computer).<br />
There are a lot of other bios settings that help things but my bios is so old I couldn't do anything else and thus I can't give you more suggestions.<br />
6. Mess with datarate.txt. With my cable modem I had it on 9, but this was sending more data then my CPU could handle. Don't be afraid to turn this down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doing these changes I went from going LD once or twice a night to NEVER going LD, and didn't change any system components.<br />
