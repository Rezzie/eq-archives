<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pirmin</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I’m quite surprised that no one else has thrown a fit here over the CH-subject. I guess I’ll have a stab at it.<br />
<br />
CH – our last bastion, has been given away. The spell that our class was pretty much built around and made us stand out as healers – the only thing we’re really good at. I’m not arguing with the fact that shamens and druids need this (in a raid setting or possibly in an exp setting) but what about us? Where does this leave us?<br />
<br />
We’ve been marginalized and overlooked for so long and maybe it’s time for VI to give our class a MAJOR over haul… but I don’t think this will happened. So far I’ve seen 2 highly situational (and mana expensive) heals being mentioned, a new pet or hammer spell (probably worse than our old beloved “Unswerving Hammer of Uselessness”) and Yaulp5… We cry bloody murder and they give us yaulp? Oh joy of joys…<br />
<br />
I’ve been playing this game since it was released and I have put a lot of work into my cleric character (not to mention all in game bonds formed over the years) but if something huge, something drastically improving, doesn’t happened to our class – I am outta here!<br />
<br />
I’m tired and I’m weary. <br />
I feel let down.<br />

Wait till everything goes live. If it went live the way it is now, I would agree with you, but please give the developers some  time to work things out.<br />
<br />
A lot of the time, the developers are already right here, reading some very, very long threads.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing that I'd recommend doing at this point is holding off before letting panic set in.<br />
<br />
*IF* these changes were to go live, please don't think that there wouldn't be a significant upgrade for Clerics going right alongside them.<br />
<br />
Something that would enhance their desirability in exp groups, give them a little diversity, and maybe even something that would make people value the idea of more than one Cleric in an exp group.<br />
<br />
He's not much for patting himself on the back, but as a guy who used to play a Cleric quite a bit, I'd be pretty thrilled to get some of the changes Jahaar and others have been considering.<br />
<br />
Please have a little patience and hold off on passing judgment.<br />
<br />
We asked the same thing of the Necros while working on DoT stacking and other issues, and it may be a stretch to try to ask the same here when emotions are obviously running high.<br />
<br />
But, if you could: Please, do try to have a little faith.<br />
<br />
No pun intended.<br />
<br />
<br />
(I'm obviously not referring to the hammer change -- That was just a common-sense alteration for both Clerics and Wizards. The changed ones actually do pay off, and fairly well at that.)<br />

Take care,<br />

Trotting out the Druid and Shamans Heals one day and 36 hours later posting a few spells, than on that face of it, do NOT (what's he say?<br />
enhance their desirability in exp groups, give them a little diversity, and maybe even something that would make people value the idea of more than one Cleric in an exp group. <br />
<br />
My melee SUCKS and it is maxxed - topped out and had been for 15 levels.  Giving me a new hammer, even with the bonuses from the new Yaulp and my DPS contribution will not match ONE of the Dots my competitors can deliver... and they have more than one, usually.  EXP groups are all about killing as much as you can, as fast as you can, without dying.   If the cleric's competition adds more to that equation, then the cleric wont get the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordlin</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will also be quitting my Cleric soon :( <br />
<br />
I've played since September 1999 and seen a lot of changes (Cleric since late last year) This is the final straw. Cleric's are basically useless except to heal and rezz. We can solo 1 mob a time then we are oom and sitting on our butts for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Our new spells on test...<br />
<br />
Group celestial elixir type spell. Sounds nice and is, but very situational. I wouldn't use it. As a top up heal for 2 or 3 people it's mana intensive and slow. In HoT it would be good against ae'ers thats about it. 1200 heal over time for all in group. <br />
<br />
Yaulp 5 - increase in some stats 25 percent haste (why??) and 10 mana per tick....but then Yaulp doesn't stack with Blessed armour line. Sort of a canni for clerics but I won't be wasting a spell slot.<br />
<br />
New direct heal. 1600 heal for 525 mana 5 second cast time. Completely useless to us. By the time this heal hits on a caster they are already dead, by the time it hits on a main tank as a top up, you might as well of just cast complete heal. Really you need to have 25++ aa points to gain any benefit from this spell. I can't get in a normal xp group as it is let alone with Druids/Shammies being able to heal better than us now, this heal will not see the light of day for me - make it 2600 heal with the same mana and cast time and that would be type of thing I would use.<br />
<br />
The focus item...I'm betting it's chest slot zero ac neg 50 all saves and saves 5 percent mana per cast, except on complete heal as per usual. Sorry, but I doubt it will be of any benefit - lets face it Clerics, people at VI don't play our class!<br />
<br />
Basically whichever way you look at it, Cleric's are being phased out. You will see a lot of them around as alts for the rezz aspect but their only function now is in a complete heal chain. Sorry I want more from the game (including my epic but then I'm a Cleric and it seems to be illegal to have more than 20 Cleric epics per server...). I shall be starting a Wizard so I can form a group of 6 people and manaburn mobs that would usually take a full raid to kill, or perhaps a druid so I can solo and kill things without using any mana at all...yes I am bitter - I've wasted so much time and effort on my Cleric, I shouldn't have bothered.</div></div><hr />

We dont need new heals, we dont need new weapons(unless it procs 2k undead damage) and we cant really make good use of the yaulp series..since it doesnt stack with our selfbuffs.<br />

<br />
I play a Cleric, a Druid and my main is a Shaman. All i can say is VI keep your heal spells I don't want them. I can see down the road that the shaman/druid classes will end up going the way of the cleric. . . under used and forced to sit/med/heal. Yes I have been forced into this roll with all 3 characters, garnering mana to heal the tanks, and maybe once in a while buffing the group. Playing as a shaman I hate to be the main healer, it negates all my debuff spells. I absolutly love playing with a cleric in the group, I can buff/debuff to my hearts content. . .which is the Shaman specialty. All this spell will do is remove the clerics as a desired element of a group. <br />

<br />
What do you want?<br />
<br />
CH in 3 secs for 100 mana?<br />
DL in 1 sec for 20 mana?<br />
Remedy instant for 5 mana?<br />
CE in 2 secs with 4k hp over 10 secs?<br />
<br />
Would you then feel useful again?<br />
<br />
I was never in the situation that a shaman/druid was preferred over a cleric, and I dont think that will be so in the future.  If we were so crappy, we would not have tons of aego requests all the time, no other class can provide that. Our rezzing ability is highly demanded, and even raids work well with our current abilities. <br />
<br />
Some updates would be nice, for sure, but I really cannot regard clerics as the crappy useless class some ppl are stating here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think everyone’s entitled to ones own opinion. No one has to agree about anything but HOT DAMN, Sabal? Where have You been? Have You actually read what’s going down?<br />
<br />
Should we be content with casting Aego, doing resses and raiding (not to mention the fact that actually getting exp in order to get to level 60 looks more and more grim by the hour)? Should we be satisfied knowing that whatever we have for an edge as a class is summarized in a 25% better CH?<br />
<br />
How dull.<br />
How narrow.<br />
How utterly devoid of any form of imagination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pag0</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">aye, Sable, I kind of agree with you that some people are VERY much over reacting to this, especially since nothing has gone live yet. <br />
<br />
However, I also notice that you are a Venerable High Priestess, which tells me that you do not have a large need for exp groups which is what most of the complaints here are about. AA exp was bad enough for the lower lvl players who now had the extra competition from lvl 60s who started to exp again for AA, but now the mid 50s clerics have to seriously contend with druids and shammies for exp groups on a day to day basis. When people are faced with sitting for seriously extended times LFG, perhaps there is a problem, and simply discounting them because of your personal experience isn't the best solution :p <br />
<br />
A totally positive thing is that VI is making any effort at all. That should give all clerics hope for improvement, no matter how positive or negative their view is on the class. Balancing clerics is a fairly serious challenge, and I for one am glad to see them making some effort<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to sit back, relax, trust that the Test Server clerics will do their best to help and make positive changes for us. When things go live, then we can have reasonable discussions on the pros and cons of the changes as they come. I for one can't wait to hook up with a group and wade into battle with my newly acquired epic in my bag and a Hammer of Judgement swinging while I auction WTB Haste=)</div></div><hr />

I've very tired of fights needing 12 clerics... not because its that bad a fight mind you, its because our mana dries up that fast.<br />
<br />
we are working with 2.4-3.2 ratio spells.  Wizards are working with 3.2-4.1 ratio spells.  our cast times suck, our range sucks, our total output sucks.<br />
<br />
I want shaman and druids to have ch, our version, not a skimpy one.  It will point out how bad clerics really do suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caressa</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG this is such garbage.  I'm so glad that I've wasted most of the past year leveling up my cleric and working on getting raid-friendly aa-points.  I think that clerics, when forced to solo, will be wishing that they had put AA points into Strength, Regeneration, Spell Casting Fury and other advancements, rather than the alternative PREFERRED AA points towards Mass Group Buff, for example.<br />
<br />
Additionally, we've already posted on our GUILD message board a notice to the effect that clerics will now be bidding on/expecting to get a shot at the following:<br />
<br />
HP/AC Gear<br />
PRIMAL 1hb from Sleeper's Tomb<br />
Haste Items<br />
<br />
After all, how high does our wisdom have to be to whack away at a mob?  It doesn't take much mana to root a mob either.<br />
<br />
Time to whip out my 56 Pally and level her up to 60.... no wait... pally's are gimp too.  Given the choice of a Pally or an SK in a group that has a Druid healer (with the new spells), most exp groups would pick an SK any day of the week /sigh.<br />
<br />
Ok, guess, then I'll be leveling up my 22 druid or my level 5 monk, or my level 5 rogue.<br />
<br />
This really just sucks IMO.  I hope that Verant comes to their senses.  I don't begrudge druids/shammy's becoming more powerful, but darn-it, make the clerics more powerful as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hileth</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone remember the hue and cry that went out when they lowered the level that Druids and Shamans got Superior Healing? Then, as now, many clerics threatened to retire and were worried that they wouldn't be wanted in groups. At that time, I think I was about 37 or 38 and Superior Healing was already becoming less useful as a heal. I surmised then that at 51 it would be even less efficient.  I was right.  By the time I got into my 50s I had no problems with people wanting a druid in the group over me.<br />
   My rl roomie plays a 53 druid, and when she's main healer for a group she goes oom quick. These new changes would be a nice upgrade for her. She, like many druids I know, doesn't like being the main healer though. She'd rather have a cleric in the group so she can do other things. This would, however, make her a more efficient back up healer. For example if she's in a group where the tanks are having a taunting contest, the cleric can heal one and she can heal the other for more than her current 1 bub at a time.  On those occasions where she is main healer, it should make her job easier then too.<br />
    Personally, I enjoy grouping with Druids. They add a lot to a group and their back up healing has saved my life more than once. For some strange reason Mobs tend to take a dim view of you complete healing their dinner.<br />
   In short giving Druids/Shamans better heals won't make me retire my cleric. I think this can be mutually beneficial.<br />

<br />
Shaman do not need any new additions- I watch 60 shm solo WW dragons. I don't think they need any sort of extra heal. (Hello torpor???)<br />
<br />
I think dru could stand one more heal, along the lines of Divine Light. But their epic is like making toast to make up for that lack.<br />
<br />
As it is I get pushed out of exp groups sometimes because shm have heals AND!!! they're so much more useful in that they can slow and dot and sow and some can tank and make potions and they have a pet! Clerics just sit on their asses.<br />
<br />
I don't like too many of the clerics I meet. I can't stand how they play, I can't stand their attitudes (holier than thou *chuckle*). I can't stand that they yap and play gems when they should be paying attention. But to give such a large upgrade to the other priest classes- when the other priest classes have all kinds of fun things that clerics don't have(or need)? Is this punishment?<br />
<br />
My cleric can't snare. Or dot. or quad. or solo in PoG. I don't want her to (ok yeah sometimes I would like to). I have whole sets of spells I never use.<br />
<br />
A cleric is a center for her group, for her raid. She stabilizes a group and makes them feel confident that she won't be busy nuking or dotting something and not be able to heal them. She provides the comfort of a ressurection, to take off the sting of mistakes. She brings them back to continue working on that powerful mob. She's sturdy and dependable and a right avatar of her god. She should NOT be nuking unless she absolutely MUST. She should not be hunting solo, her constituition does not allow for that- her armour is there to keep her alive while she keeps her faithful group alive. <br />
<br />
If SOE wants to revamp my class, I want to be able to go back and change my starting stats to better make use of these new changes- which have yet to be fully developed although we all know the shm and dru will be getting a shiny new heal they don't need. How is giving dru and shm a better heal evening out the cleric? <br />
<br />
I'll wait to see where this goes.... but if I find myself looked over in groups for dru or shm, Rich and Scott will be getting a very grumpy letter and I'll be leveling a shaman up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* WHO CARES *<br />
<br />
These so called &quot;significant upgrades&quot; are nothing more than a bone being thrown to yet another class that has had it's uniqueness and groupability DESTROYED by Verant's very public and very obvious love affair with the Druid class. <br />
<br />
And as I've said before - if you think for one single moment that the silly little &quot;cap&quot; won't be *quietly* lifted a few patches down the road, then you are a hopeless n00b that isn't a veteran of these upgrade wars. And when (I said *when* not *if*) the cap is lifted, then Druids will have the CH that they whined so hard about in that now famous petition. <br />
<br />
As I recall they whined for a &quot;limited form or rez&quot; too... so you need to get used to that idea too. Right now. <br />
<br />
The message Verant is sending is VERY VERY clear here. Whatever Lola wants... Lola GETS. Druids whine and petition and Bam! They've got what they want. Criticals on thier nuke's are next. You know it. I know. <br />
<br />
The Druid's SURE know it. You should head on over to the Grove, and read the crowing over there. <br />
<br />
The idea that you would throw Clerics some absolutely ridiculous MELEE STAT BUFFS (think for second about that... MELEE BUFFS... for a CLERIC... *snork*) so that they would be okay with you giving away one of the RARE things you haven't already given away that makes him unique and desirable is... well... it's an insult. Plain and simple. <br />
<br />
Anyone who's ever tried to get a camp in Grey, or SD, or TD, or CS where the Druids are literally LINED UP (without exaggeration) to quad every significant camp in the entire zone should find the idea that they need to be given yet ANOTHER classe's unique spells and abilities a very sad and unfunny joke. <br />

Just ask Wizards.<br />

I could see a slightly better heal for them, but 2900???<br />

Also, peeps talk about us still being needed in the highend game.  How long will it take clerics to get there, if they are not sought after in the low/middle/high-middle game?  Splain me that, Lucy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ludashanus</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too am tired of people saying how another class gets a similar spell and then it sends the Cleric Class into a spiral to destruction. Isn't this a little extreme?<br />
<br />
The Cleric class has so many aspects to it that so many negative people seem to forget. I would bet you that I could get groups as a cleric even if the Shaman and Druids had the exact same spells. Why? Because I make a party fun and the way I play my little dwarf (I'm not little!) adds to the whole EQ experience.<br />
<br />
Those that play to get as much from the mob, to declare to the other classes, &quot;Hey I'm a great class that no one can touch!&quot; seem to be lacking the whole reason I play this game. I don't play for the treasure, the money, the equipment first. I play to have fun.<br />
<br />
Whether they strip the cleric and give all their spells away is not in question, unless they try to do it to me (I look terrible with just my breastplate removed). Whether they take enough away to not make it fun for me is the question.<br />
<br />
If you're not having fun playing a cleric, play another class. Stop ranting of how terrible verant or VI is. Get over it. You're probably all high elves intent on being the best.<br />
<br />
On that note, play a race that has some class, you silly high elf! A dwarf, though far superior than the other taller races, is more interesting. The Gnomes are special and a great class. (If they had a Race transfer service everyone would end up playing dwarves, because we're so much cooler than everyone else. Come on you know it!)<br />
<br />
All you focus on is <br />
&quot;I'm a High Elf&quot; <br />
&quot;I start with the highest wisdom&quot; <br />
&quot;I'm so much better than anyone else because at level five I got plane armor&quot; <br />
&quot;Oh, woe is me, I'm so pathetic now because druids can cast complete heal&quot; <br />
&quot;Whine, whine, whine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now let us analyze this as a dwarf. &quot;They get Complete Heal? Great, now I can cast a powerful nuke spell and finally see 'Lud has killed the drovolag' (or however you spell it)&quot;<br />
<br />
So you can whine whine whine and feel pathetic, much like a Gnome Necro, or you can delight in the fact that a secondary healer can give you the ability to do something other than healing!<br />

At 60 there are not a lot of pure blue con undead (the only thing we can remotely solo without being oom straight after). In the Grey there are more than most places..but the shimmering rock fiends number in the hundreds and the pure blue undead are often very hard to find anyway.<br />
<br />
I tried one day to get a group in Seb. I tried for 1 hour. I gave up. I tried then to get a group in Karnor's. No luck there either. I then moved to Chardock. No luck there. I moved to Velkts Lab. No luck there - well everyone was soloing. I ran around all over the place searching for groups for 4 hours. I gave up and camped in the end. That's the situation at the moment. Any possible hope of getting a group is completely gone with the new Druid heals. basically Clerics are complete heal chain members and rezzers - that's it.<br />
<br />
As a level 60 Cleric I cannot solo and I cannot get a group. I don't want to just raid, I want to have fun, get loot and aa xp. <br />
<br />
The melee aspect of the Cleric is a joke. Giving us a shiny new hammer (obviously a pathetic attempt to disctract us from the fact that there is a 1 year waiting list on Ragefire for epic) and yaulp 5 is not the answer. That hammer better proc every half a second because on any pure blue mob which will give any decent amount of xp our 1hb skills won't score higher than 10 damage most of the time.<br />
<br />
Lud you said if you are not having fun playing a Cleric, play another class. Why the heck should I? Played time is over 100 days for me and I put a lot of time and effort not to mention tens of thousands of plat into my Cleric. Every member of my Guild has contributed to getting me equipment and spells. I'm not about to throw that all away. If you ever get to 60 (assuming they don't remove the lvl 59 hell lvl) you wouldn't quit either. <br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, I play a Dwarf.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok couple things I need to get off my chest.<br />
<br />
These so called &quot;significant upgrades&quot; are nothing more than a bone being thrown to yet another class that has had it's uniqueness and groupability DESTROYED by Verant's very public and very obvious love affair with the Druid class. <br />
Are you KIDDING ME? Druids are never EVER in any patch messages. I can count on one hand how many times druids have been in a patch message over the last year  for a tweak of somekind.<br />
<br />
Shaman with slow, haste, tropor, 3000 point heal &gt; Cleric CH  <br />
Shamans only get a 1975 Cheal<br />
<br />
As a level 60 Cleric I cannot solo and I cannot get a group. I don't want to just raid. <br />
If you cant get a group if your a cleric, you have some serious online social issue problems. Clerics and Enchanters CORNER the group/exp market<br />
<br />
The message Verant is sending is VERY VERY clear here. Whatever Lola wants... Lola GETS. Druids <br />
Druids get the same crits as any other nuker. 7% rate and 100% added to total nukes, just like everyone other class with it.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's ever tried to get a camp in Grey, or SD, or TD, or CS  <br />
Say hello to the quad kite zones, thats what they are. I didnt make them that way. They are BUILT for druids and wizards to kite there brains out. Thats just the way it is.<br />
<br />
I could see a slightly better heal for them, but 2900???  <br />
<br />
Ok get this through your HEADS. This spell IS NOT A 3k HEAL. I spoke to about 5 different 60th level druids on test and they all told me this spell ONLY heals the target to 3 1/2 BUBBLES on the life bar. Meaning if you have 1000hp total and your down to 1hp it will only heal you 749hps. The 3k part is the MAX it will heal a person to get them to 3 1/2 bubbles. THIS SPELL SUCKS. I will NEVER EVER use it unless im in a raid chain. Christ when I was talking to them, ALL of them were grouped with clerics lol!<br />
<br />
Clerics cant solo, snare, or melee <br />
HELLO? THATS NOT YOUR JOB. Your job is to protect and to rid the world of the undead. END OF LIST. Thats it. What the fawk would a cleric be doing meleeing at level 60? You have the best heals and AC/HP buffs because that is  what you specialize in.  Your not put in game to be meleeing, nuking and snareing.. Thats the job of other classes. YOU SIT, MED, HEAL, BUFF AND REZ. If you dont like that job, DONT BE A CLERIC!<br />
<br />
We’ve been marginalized and overlooked for so long<br />
Didnt you guys get a 1k nuke, some undead slows, dots and nukes? What else do you want? Anything else would go outside your roll.  <br />
<br />
Ok now for some good and bad suggestions I have seen.<br />
<br />
1. Snare, Dot, Slow and more Undead Nukes. That works.. Its your field take care of it.<br />
<br />
2. Undead Charm - nope never happen. Why? Because your the anti-undead. Thats why necros can charm undead because they are in league with the undead.<br />
<br />
3. Haste - Self haste fine - but if you get haste for melee, that wouldnt work. That is a enchanter and shamans role.  As I said before you are here to protect the melee not to increase there fighting ability.<br />
<br />
Some of my ideas:<br />
<br />
1. Self port to your hometown without a stone. &quot;Prayer of&quot; whatever. I like that Idea. 5 second cast time.  Just a neat idea.<br />
<br />
2. Clerics Summoning Rez - Very good idea. A Mixture of Rezzing and Summoning Corps all in one. You would be grouped with the cleric. He would cast this spell on YOU and your corps would come to you and you would be rezed. This of course would only be good if you are actually in the zone.<br />
<br />
3. Clerics should have natural none argo Damage Shields against the undead.<br />
<br />
4. The ability to bless food and water to make it a mirac drink/food<br />
<br />
5. The ability to bless arrows and throwing weapons to give it undead bane damage.<br />
<br />
6. The ability to summon undead bane weapons.<br />
<br />
7. Heavy undead nukes. in line with druids and mages but against undead only.<br />
<br />
8. Crit as much as wizards do when nuking but only against undead.<br />
<br />
9. AA ability that would allow the cleric to have a manaburn vs undead.<br />
<br />
10. A Group AC/HP buff that will stack with Druid line of AC/HP buffs. <br />
<br />
and so on.. there are alot of cool ideas I have but some I really cant explain.</div></div><hr />

We are trying to throw around ideas to make clerics more usefull in an exp group. What you have said that you think is worthy, wouldn't do **** quite frankly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of our ideas are a little off the wall but...<br />
<br />
With Shamans having a new heal, a cleric adding an undead charmed pet might make things more balanced.<br />
<br />
Shaman with haste, heals, buffs(SoW), slows, debuffs, pet . <br />
Is more equal to <br />
Cleric with heals, buffs, and a cleric pet.<br />
Then one with out a pet.<br />
But imo still stronger on the shaman side.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also we got no undead slow to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 11:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure windfire!!!    a bunch of new undead spells with no new undead zones.   perfect idea if every new zone added was undead only.  Verant should only add zones with 100% undead til the undead zones equal the live ones.   THEN the undead spells would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Besides windfire maybe you should not be the one to talk about clerics should accept &quot;what their role is?????   Seems to me druids were the ones not happy being quad kiter extraordinaires, snarer, nuker, ds, etcc etc.  With everything they had they were not happy with &quot;what their role was&quot;   They wanted more.  you have all the other jobs that you listed but you wanted to be a better &quot;healer&quot; also.  <br />
<br />
Us talking about you haveing a 3K heal makes as much sense as the druids continually talking about CH being a 10k heal.   When was the last time you saw a 10K tank.   One of the druids was actually asking for a heal that took as long as CH but healed 8K cause that would be 80%.  CH usually goes off in exp group with tank having 1 bubble of life left.   That makes CH an 80% heal compared to your 75% heal.    oOOOOOO 5% difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
Average tank outside of raids only has 5K hps.    your heal lands for 3K mine for 4K    So you are 75% as effective as I am.   NOW i want 75% of your abilities (snare, SOW, port, invis, ds, str buff, regen).    Dont tell me about &quot;accepting my role&quot; when you whine til your role gets expanded to include everything.   I can just see the next druid petition   &quot; why yes we can root but our CC should be 75% as good as an enchanters so we want the ability to mez up to 4 mobs at once, oh and we want this and that too.   WE are so neglected because we quad from hell and have ungodly untility abilities.&quot;   That cleric should shut up about his only group ability(healilng) and sit back while we kick him out of that.<br />
<br />
I say when they nerf all of the other druids abilities such as SOW, snare, quading, porting, invis, ds etc then they can be 75% as good as us.<br />
<br />
Man i went from being a supporter of druids getting this spell to opposed all with your post windfire   CONGRATS<br />
<br />
telling me to be happy with my role and the rest is not my job.  Why dont you follow your own advice and stay the h3!! out of the clerics job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok calmed down a little.  <br />
<br />
Windfire, sorry I went off but there are a total of like 5? zones that are undead.   So every cleric should be crowded into these zones trying to get some exp?   I dont begrudge you the ability to heal better but I need something to make me useful in a group.   Healing alone will not cut it in an exp group anymore.  The new druid heal coupled with regen will be plenty to keep a party going.  This coupled with the other druid abilities far outstrips anything a cleric can do.  You need a better heal for raid exp.  Heck I agree.   I would even support you getting a much better heal for raids.   But it should not cost me the only chance to get in an exp group(and exp since I cant solo). <br />
<br />
Dont be so shocked that clerics want some kind of versatility and not just against undead ( of which there are not that many zones) in order to make them desirable to a party.<br />
<br />
Why should undead be the end of our list?   you wanted an improvement to your class did you not?   If they added all the most desireable items in totally new undead zones then I would be fine with being good versus undead only.  Otherwise the utiltiy of skills against undead is just too limiting.<br />
<br />
We need utility against every mob, cause healing alone as a reason to put us in exp group alone just does not cut it anymore.  Druids or shaman can definitely be main healer for your average exp group.  On top of that they offer other abilities such as slow, track, snare, ds, str buffs, dex buffs etc.  There should be an aura benefit from having a cleric in your group which adds to atk, haste and damage against mobs.   <br />
<br />
yes we have great hp buffs but at 11p per cast.   Druids get all buffs free<br />
<br />
Yes we will always be needed for raids.  But without some appeal to exp groups you will see less clerics able to raise themself to raid level if we cant solo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of us signed on to have that role, obviously.  We knew we were going to primarily sit, heal and hopefully keep everyone alive.  Druids are getting something they dont need (but think they want because someone else has it) and Verant gives us something we dont want at all.  Put everything back as it was.<br />
<br />
Please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids are getting something they dont need (but think they want because someone else has it) <br />
<br />
From Absor via Castersrealm:<br />
<br />
When it comes to this particular change, I think Rich explained it pretty well. The<br />
                       changes to Druid and Shaman healing are needed to remove a problem in the end<br />
                       game where some things just can't be done if there aren't enough clerics. It's a<br />
                       problem for gameplay when something like that exists. <br />
<br />
                       But the fix itself creates a problem for Clerics, not in the raid situation - where the<br />
                       fix should have the desired effect of actually reducing the absolute need for clerics<br />
                       - but in other portions of the game. We certainly are not planning to make it so<br />
                       that clerics are unwanted in exp groups and similar situations. So we're adding a fix<br />
                       for that issue.<br />
<br />
=============================<br />
<br />
That is reason we are getting this heal. Becasue guilds and groups cant do **** without a cleric. I mean clerics a very very needed these days. But if you plan to do something that requires 6-7 clerics, and you only have 5.. well you cant do it. With this new spell.. you can.<br />
<br />
This spell for me will not be used in groups at all. This spell is to chain healing on high end raids. Actually give druids a purpose on a raid... &quot;oh **** the cleric didnt show or went LD.. Windfyre get into the Chain&quot;.  Thats a good thing, not a bad thing.<br />
<br />
This is not what class is better then what class... Or I want this because you got this.. Its to better the game as a whole. If your cleric(s) go down the raid is basicly a whipe out.. But with the new spell, this will add to the healing manapool and help everyone stay alive longer. <br />
<br />
How many times have you been in a raid and brought a mob to 3-4% of its life? On raids i have seen that many times.. 3-4% and then the whipe out.. Why? Because Clerics go oom, the mod rods ran out, whatever.. With this spell that would have NEVER have happend.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordlin</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Winfire you are right...<br />
<br />
I've been on a few raids that everyone wiped at 3-4% of mob life left because I ran oom.<br />
<br />
You are right about the introduction of the new Druid heal meaning that this will never happen.<br />
<br />
Because you will see a reduction in the amount of Clerics in the game because of it. Therefor you better like healing 'cos you are going to be doing it a lot! <br />
<br />
Do you actually play a Cleric? I am not against the changes per say BUT seeing as the new Druid heals are coming and my old role, and thus desirability to group with, are now gone, I want some other options so I can keep playing my Cleric mand preferably not at the expense of other classes.<br />
<br />
I have problems getting pick up groups as posted previously - no I don't have social issues just a very limited role which is now being taken over by the Druid.<br />
<br />
Windifre, you keep spouting off about this or that is the Cleric field and we should shut up and get on with it. We are the 'protectors and ridders of undead' ...... what is there left to protect when we can't get groups and can't solo? I want to actually play the game ALL the time I am online, not just at raids and THIS is the point you have totally missed.<br />
<br />
Let's have a look at your ideas to 'improve' the Cleric class..<br />
<br />
1. Completely useless. We have the stones and I bet the majority of Cleric's either don't own one or rarely use it. I use mine, however, to manastone back up to full mana after every single soloing attempt.<br />
<br />
2. That would actually be cool...ask a Sk or Necro if they like the idea.... I hope you don't mind bad language... Nice idea but there is no way I would want to take such powerful and useful ability away from Necro's and SK's. Only a Druid could think like that..<br />
<br />
3. This would mean actually doing something other than protecting and ridding of undead! Melee situation...rofl Cleric's do not have the defensive or offensive skills to melee anything over lvl 30.<br />
<br />
4,5 and 6 Nice idea's. The grouping opportunities will roll right in I'm sure...wait a minute..what do you mean 'thanks for the stuff now get lost we have a Druid here?!'<br />
<br />
7,8 and 9 Ok I can't slate these these would be nice and useful. Pity a pure blue undead mob is pretty rare at the moment but maybe a pure undead zone will appear in PoP? (I'm 60 there isn't a lot of undead xp choice)<br />
<br />
<br />
10. Actually this would benefit Druids more than us. We have Blessed Armour of the Risen and Aego which we can cast in combo. It's either PoTG or Aego for Druids not both. We cannot have Shamen Focus and Blessed Armour of the Risen though so lets keep the druid/cleric stacking as it is and change it so that Shammy Focus stacks with Aego and Blessed Armour.<br />
<br />
BTW...my role is what I CHOOSE to make it not what you decide it to be. Clearly you don't play a Cleric as a main and although your suggestions and posts are welcomed, forgive me for not agreeing with you and thinking you are totally mad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystifaere</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello my fellow brothers and sisters.<br />
<br />
I too have been disturbed about the breaking news of a CH of sorts for the Druids and Shaman classes. I too share the concern that CH is one of the last spells that sets a cleric apart from the rest. LOL Pallies rezzing for 90% bothered me a bit but I grew accustomed to not getting /t's all day long - &quot;not like I made bank on rezzing either&quot;, Druids and Shaman healing for 75% (if it goes live) might not be such a bad thing (we dont have to heal them- right? and we can actually stand up a loot!! /giggle - J/K). And if it puts us out of business as primary healers, I sure hope VI has the decency to give CLERICS the ability to port, sow, DS and Solo/Quad. (balancing - ya know?!) LOL :p <br />
<br />
Guess we will have to wait and see. For those who feel like throwing in the towel after all you have invested into this game, I can only say have some faith, &quot; Some day when the level cap goes from 60 to 75 and all of the &quot;hahahah -balancing&quot; is done....Clerics will once again reign supreme as the primary &quot;arse savers of the game&quot; - you can bet on it. IMHO. - Flame shield on!!<br />
<br />
/em sits down and prays to Tunare - please give the VI programmers enough sense to make our future cleric spells something decent and well named.<br />
<br />
***stops and chuckles to herself - thinking about the group saying, &quot;Ok!! Hit me with cabbage!!&quot;***<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Attla</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Windfire, I for one like that you took the time to come up with realistic fixes for us, and I agree with many of them except the summon-rez type thing, I'd never want that, and necros would have a holy golden baby if that happened.<br />
<br />
I would love to see SERIOUS undead nukes along with more undead dots/snares/whatever, problem is there is only so many places to find them.  We need more undead mobs and I have always believed we should be the master damage dealers on them.<br />
<br />
As for all you that claim druids will take our spots, I just dont' see it happening.  I think many of you are caught up in the storm of anticipation, regardless of news from test.  Everyone tends to overlook the social aspect of  the game and concentrate on class vs class.<br />
<br />
I have lots of &quot;misfit&quot; friends that &quot;suck&quot;, according to the class vs class reasoning of usefulness.  I always have, and will continue to group with Paladins, Rangers, and any other class people claim &quot;suck&quot; because they are my friends.<br />
<br />
If you want groups, step one is find NEW people to group with, go to zones that are difficult and new,  not the same old boring VL, Seb, KC or whatever 80% of the EQ population does.<br />
<br />
Step 2, and probably the biggest, /role or /anon is NOT your friend, try taking it off and seeing how it works out for you, and don't tell me &quot;oh but I do all the time,&quot; spare me.  I have sat for the last 2 weeks and /who all 60 cleric, /who all 59 cleric, etc etc...and NEVER have I been able to get a larger than 20 list.  I doubt seriously things are any different on your server either.  Complaining about not getting a &quot;good&quot; group is unwarranted, nobody else is guaranteed a good group either, take the good with the bad just like the other 14 classes do.  Any group is better than the Bazaar non-xp group.<br />
<br />
As for the crystal ball outcome about how we will be replaced in xp groups, have the ball checked and wait and see what happens.  In the meantime, meet new people and swing the new hammer around, the sky is not falling.<br />
<br />
As for Windfire, thanks for enduring the rants, I for one appreciate just your attempt at coming up with things that...*gasp* nobody here thought of.  And I thought many of them were'nt half bad but NO CORPSE SUMMONING! Egad, the necros would rant to hell and back, and traveling to res is bad enough, I don't want the extra.  Necros play with corpses and undead things, we fix corpses and kill undead things and I like it that way.</div></div><hr />

That sure does make a lot of sense....duh<br />

Let them all start ranting like us clerics are, after all, that is certainly not their main thing, with all the other weapons at their disposal, and their great soloing ability.<br />

If a wizard wants to go and melee, he mad the wrong choice. There are things that you are geared to do.<br />

How many times do I have to remind you that it's a game?<br />
<br />
The definition of game from dictionary.com:<br />
An activity providing entertainment or amusement; a pastime: party games; word games.<br />
<br />
I'll play it how I want to play it, you play it how you want to play it.  There are no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; choices.  I don't pay $13 a month for someone to come and tell me that I'm playing my character incorrectly because he doesn't like it.  I'm paying $13 a month to have fun.</div></div><hr />

I am now fairly sure you're a good example of someone who needs to go outside, take a breath of fresh air, and not be so resistant to change.<br />
<br />
You're beginning to seem like a zit, right between the eyes of the cleric community.  I suppose you've even perpetuated this hatred over on the Druid's Grove?<br />

<br />
This is getting old, and that will be my last contribution in a thread about this issue.<br />
<br />
I participated to the discussion on druid grove about the new heals before they came on test, and at start the true problem is that the CURRENT heals of the druids didn't follow the hp mudflation of melees (and even casters).<br />
<br />
Never the issue was that they want to completely be able to replace clerics in a raid or group situation, just retune the existing heals to be in line with the current game reality and make them percent based so they follow the mudflation curve in a more logical way.<br />
<br />
When VI put the new heal under the form of a CH, it seem that the whole idea changed, and that people started to focus more and more on the fact they want to be able to replace clerics in a CH chain.<br />
<br />
In fact, the more I think about it the more I enjoy seeing more people able to get in the CH chains while I am out of it healing maybe the rampage tank (wich usualy is more entertaining), and still have mana and time to do some nuking at the end of fight, I enjoy too the idea that when I delog I don't feel a drama happening in my guild because 1 &quot;too precious&quot; cleric is logging out and raid power is lowering, in reality I really start to accept and enjoy the idea of sharing this weight with more people.<br />
<br />
Now about the abolute cleric power compared to other classes, Verant showed they were aware that it needed to be reput in line if such thing had to happen, the fact they put our upgrades before any heal upgrades for others classes is enough to show that they understood the problem and they work on it seriously.<br />
<br />
The true question is, after 2 or 3 years you play your char, will you be happy with what he will become ? I imagine that most of us play the cleric since years, we have seen every facet of the healing side, a little change of perspective can only be fun the time EQ lasts (and if VI screw that up, that time maybe be shorter, but we are not maried nor have a exclusivity contract with EQ, others games are coming next year, but I'm sure they won't)...<br />
<br />
That one more class become overpowered won't keep me from sleeping at night, shaman are, monks are, druids ask why not us too ? that right in fact, why not them too ? is that our problem as clerics? not at all, they live their life, we live ours, everyone is happy at home if he want to.<br />
<br />
I am a proud cleric, not because I am the only one to CH, but because I am a dark elf, because the cleric is the priest of the more civilised races (not minde, but Verant definition) and because we look good :P<br />
<br />
I would never play a shamy, and never play a druid, not because they can't CH, but because I like to be a cleric, that's all.<br />

There is no way in hell that a group is going to take a druid rather than me if they go to the places that I like the most : deep Chardok, deep Sebilis, dogs in VL, deep in Akheva.  <br />

If anything goes wrong I bring the dead back to life at a minimal cost.  Druids will never be able to do this.  Sure, they might be more active in the super easy zones but they will have no effect on my exp habits.  I usually have a druid or two in my groups (I only group with friends) and I welcome their new abilities.  I played one to level 53 and trust me, post 50 exping is hard as hell as a druid.  No one wants you.  Ever.  They need something.</div></div><hr />

NO ONE HAS GOTTEN ANY NEW HEALING SPELLS EXCEPT CLERICS!<br />
<br />
Shut up all ready on this subject until there is actually something to talk about. As of right now, Druids got nothing, Shamans got nothing and clerics got a few more healing spells and some new hammer toys to play with (for 56+ of course). <br />

Did you look at the mana costs?  I might use ethereal remedy in certain situations (but dl or remedy in most).  I don't think I'd ever use ethereal light.  I'd rather use dl, remedy, ethereal remedy, or even CH in situations where that spell is intended.</div></div><hr />
