<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dizzi</div><div class="date">04-21-2000, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From level 44 onwards it is more than possible to solo the assassin / supplier room in lower guk. This is excellent exp for lvl 45 and 46 especially and generally its safe. So safe its boring. Once the spawn is broken and staggered its childs play.<br />
<br />
So the question is how to break the spawn?<br />
<br />
Well, its hard, but doable. My technique is as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Go to the room invis and go to one corner behind the barrels.<br />
<br />
2) If the assassin is already in the room he will see thru the invis and basically you go straight to step 3.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you select the closest ghoul and enstill him. They will now all aggro on you.<br />
<br />
3) Enstill two of the ghouls as fast as possible. If you get too many interupts just gate out and try again after medding (I find  gate works pretty much 80% now if i put my back to the wall).<br />
<br />
With 2 ghouls enstilled (assuming you are not rooted yourself ... in which case GATE) you run off the ladder with one ghoul following you. Enstill him here.<br />
<br />
4) Now run back up and ATONE both the ghouls which should be quite far away, and drop off theledge (if enstill drops ... probably best to GATE)<br />
<br />
5) Now you simply kill the one ghoul downstairs with root and banish.<br />
<br />
6) Go invis, med for 8-10 mins and repeat the whole process again to get another ghoul downstairs.<br />
<br />
Even with a couple of bad starts having to gate out you should get the spawn broken and spaced within 40 to 50 mins. Once its broken you can make tons of exp, and psossibly even get a TBB.</div></div><hr />

I camped this once at 45 and it was cake because it was already broken. Breaking solo like this sounds like fun though, I'm gonna try it 8-)<br />
