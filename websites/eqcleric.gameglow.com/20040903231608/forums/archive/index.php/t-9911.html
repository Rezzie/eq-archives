<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amojoman</div><div class="date">12-05-2000, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all,<br />
<br />
This is quite long, and I appologize before hand.  <br />
<br />
I read the board on a daily basis, but until just recently I have not had any reason to post.  As to all the rants, I can sympathize for I have been there.  But, here is my rant that has been bugging me for about a month now.<br />
<br />
2 bubbles of experience into level 42.  My group and I are hunting in Frontier Mountains at some Sarnark ruins that are sitting on top of a small hill.  Stupid me forgot to bind at the entrance to the zone, like I usually do.  So I bind 20 yards from where we were hunting.  We had been there roughly an hour hunting, and I get a tell from a rogue asking for a res for his friend.  (I have not, nor will I ever keep /role or /anon on for more than a day)  I politely told him that I was unavailable for a res at the moment.  The Rogue searched the entire zone for me.  We were fighting 2 Sarnarks, and in comes this Rogue with the corpse of his friend, 2 Giants and a couple of Burynai.  Total group wipeout.  Because I had bound near the campsite, I got stuck in a death loop and after 2nd death, I /q  to escape the death cycle.  When I was told area was clear, I log back in only to find the rogue training me again.  After the dust settled, I died 9 times in about 30 minutes, 8 of my bodies decayed.  I was only able to get 1 res on myself.  I lost 7 1/2 bubbles of experience, Lost 42 and almost lost 41, thanks to resuscitate on myself, I was able to keep 41 but barely.  <br />
<br />
My rant is this,  I die 9 times to a NON planar/Dungeon raid, lose as much experience as I did, only to find out the rogue did not die once.  My group gets totally wiped out by this rogue, and all he can say is &quot;Whoops, I didn't know they were behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Upside to this mess, After 1 1/2 hours of cr for my group and resuscitates on everyone, including the rogue's friend, the rogue gives me a Forest Loop and says, &quot;This dropped off one of the Giants that killed you.&quot;  Ever since then, I keep getting tells from this rogues alt character (50+ wizard) giving me things just because he feels guilty for my deaths.  His first few tells I responded with, &quot;Umm, do I know you?&quot;<br />
then with, &quot;Oh yeah, You're the one that got my group and I killed over and over again.  What can I do for you?&quot;  And of course this made him feel even worse and I end up getting whatever I need free.  (I'm a DE with a long long memory, and will torment anyone that's pissed me off.  I know, I know, this is quite mean but it was the only way I knew (other than outright chewing him out) to get my point across that No meant No.  Since then, He has been very understanding of the situation and knows that when I have time, I will go res him.  <br />
<br />
<br />
On another note, Because I am not /anon or /role, I get many many tells asking for ressurects.  It got really bad after I hit level 49.  One Friday night, I had planned to get in a little bit of hunting for myself and set off for Trakanon's Teeth.  Before I can get out of the outpost, I get a tell asking me for a ressurect.  Being as it was on my way, I agree to do the ressurect.  En route, I get another tell.  To make a long story short, I traveled from Over There oupost, to Trakanon's Teeth, to Permafrost and every zone in between, Including ButcherBlock and mistmoore.  8 hours later, (yes I'm a sucker for helping those in need.  Story up above sort of made me more sensitive to the loss of experience.) I'm still ressurecting people.  I was extremely tired, extremely pissed off and only 750pp richer (I never charge for my services, and will only accept donations of potions, spells, jems or something useful to my group members)  But accepted 500pp from someone in Mistmoore because of the train factor, and 250pp in Butcherblock because I was pissy and ready to start hunting for myself.  So I came up with this /afk message <br />
<br />
 &quot;My appologies, but I have set this time aside for ME and ME only.  Please hold off on any requests for my services until ME time is over.  Thank you for your cooperation and Good Luck.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Then I proceeded to park myself in front of some necro's corpse who was spamming the zone, and myself with tells, looking for a res.  I sat there for almost an hour watching him pout and spew obscenities at me because I was only sitting there doing nothing.  I use that /afk message any time I need time to myself.  Try it sometime, you might get a few good laughs out of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">12-05-2000, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know how you feel, I very rarely have /anon or /role on. Sometimes I can be a sucker for a fellow who got killed, especially if they lost a level.<br />
But too many &quot;I will be there with my corpse in 5 min&quot; have turned out lasting 1 hour or more, and as a casual player I simply don't have the time to be all that nice to my fellow players. When travelling to get to a place to hunt or whatever or being in a group I have no hesitation to turn down a request for a rez.<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like helping out, and sometimes only log in for a hour or 2 to fool around, rezzing, healing and buffing etc. just because I can  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
But it's my playtime, and I alone choose how to spend it.<br />
<br />
I don't have a AFK message, but these replies mostly work very well for me (in descending order).<br />
<br />
1. Sorry, I'm busy<br />
2. Sorry, I'm in a group<br />
3. If you can't find another cleric, leave your corpse with only 1 item on it at the zone (or any landmark) and I will rez it if I get the time.<br />
4. no<br />
5. NO<br />
6. What part of &quot;no&quot; didn't you understand?<br />
7. Please stop begging me! <br />
8. Never gotten here yet, but I will if the beggar keeps harazzing me put him on /ignore.<br />
<br />
This may seem a bit harsh, but trust me, I've had a couple of 6's and 7's *sigh*</div></div><hr />

There were extremely few high level clerics around, so I was getting begs from everyone in creation.<br />
