<br />
Yesterday and the day prior I went on some quests with friends.  First was the quest for gauntlets in South Karana to the centaur.  Very cool..  Then yesterday was my training and memorizing and later I went on a quest for a sword.  Wow, I remember Halas in a former life, but I never got high enough to go where Tundra Jack is.  :o)  Also while we were there we went looking for mammoth ribs.  Did I mention I hated the death of the elephants in SK?  Well, it is the same for the mammoth in Everfrost. *sigh*  So sad..  Today we will finish those two quests and be off again to fight for the justice of Norrath.  <br />
<br />
Next Saturday I hope to have built up enough faction to do one of my cleric quests as well.  The quest of the Shining Star of Light weapon.  Zarina's info has helped a lot, but incase someone wants to do this quest remember to build up lots of faction for it.  Here is how and any of these will do:<br />
<br />
-Killing gnolls in Black Burrow, while doing this save the teeth. Gnoll teeth can be turned in to the captain of the guard in south Qeynos, he gives moonstones. Keep these moonstones, give to the bartender in the back of the Fishers Ale. <br />
<br />
-Kill bandits in the Karana's and save the sashes, turn into the paladin guild in south Qeynos to Chesguard. <br />
<br />
-Putrid wolf and bear pelts from Qeynos hills can be turned into the paly guild inside the disk to lady in leather. <br />
<br />
-Bone chips can be turned into Lashun Novashine in north Qeynos newbie area (sometimes on ramp to disk)<br />
<br />
-Muffins can be given to guard Winblie in south Qeynos, this will change corrupt guards faction fast though.<br />
