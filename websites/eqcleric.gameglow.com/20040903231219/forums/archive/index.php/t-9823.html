<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">04-17-2000, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to comment on how realistic the enviroment in EQ has become over the past year.<br />
<br />
When I play EQ these days I can easily see myself as the cleric in the fantasy epic adventure. I mean, our daily routine is just like that of the hero in any fantasy novel...<br />
<br />
I remember when I read Lord of The Rings and Frodo was shouting 'Camp Check' and looking for a place for him and his friends to be able to be together and wantonly destory evil just so that they could frisk the corpses and get money to buy a better sword for the ranger.<br />
<br />
I recall in the Wheel Of Time how Rand would see an evil beast and witness someone being attacked by it and how they would say &quot;MINE!&quot; he would away without helping so that the villagers would not rise up and accuse him of that heinous crime: kill stealing.<br />
<br />
I remember in the tales of Raistilen how he would suddenly appear in the moment that some dark fiend appeared.  He would blast them to death in an instant and then dissappear with a comment of 'see you back here in 8 hours'.<br />
<br />
I thrill when I recall the exploits of Pug and how when he wanted to find a special item to help defeat his enemies.  He went forth into the evil castle and found a strange red device.  From the end a piece of parchment protruded.  When he pull on the paper, it broke off in his hand and the papre said '213'.  Looking up he beheld a long line of adventurers in the hallway all grimacing at him and saying &quot;we were here first, get to the back of the line&quot;<br />
<br />
I was amazed at the wonder of it all when the hero would go and slay that mighty, dark beast and save the day fro all mankind.  And 7 minutes later the beast was back.  And the hero would attack it again muttering &quot;better have the rare this time&quot;<br />
<br />
Thank you verant for making this a special game for all of us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauntek</div><div class="date">04-18-2000, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...what causes this to be the way it is? I admit, my first thought is the oft stated 'Overcrowding'. I also in part blame the internet. But most of all I blame the people that aren't having fun.<br />
<br />
You know what I mean... the people that are just doing their best to level as fast as fast as fast as they can....the ones that 'don't have time' to investigate quests, so they download lists and make the fewest stops possible and maximise the reward.<br />
<br />
Now, I admit that I once Tumpyed a level..and I do regret it now. And I admit to going thru the quest listings... but I also TRY to enjoy myself... I TRY asking if anyone in the group feels that Tunare should bless them.. but after the third &quot;??????!@?!?!&quot; I just say &quot;Do you want buffs?&quot; to which I get a &quot;y&quot;. Well, not *all* the time tho. I also try to ASK quest people questions, not just &quot;Who &quot;bracket word&quot;&quot;.<br />
And I hear on Everlore this morning how someone can't believe no one tried to attack the NPCs doing a GM event. &quot;Even if those cheating GMs put him on god-mode, we would have tried to kill them all&quot;...<br />
.... for what benefit?<br />
One of the things that got me into this game was I liked the landscape... to the point where I felt even if I never killed anything, just being able to wander the world was &quot;cool&quot;...<br />
YES, I want to get to where I can do certain things I want to do (Quest armor for one, for that I need at least 5 more levels, but when it happens, it happens...)<br />
<br />
So... what are we all going to do when Kunark opens? try to find the Elven Princess? Go to Guk or whatnot and hope people aren't there? Commit Genocide on entire zones to work out what everything's common and rare drops are?<br />
Personally, I hope to find a zone that no one has gotten to yet, be the first one there, and try to converse with everyone/thing there.. who knows, maybe a_strange_plant_04 WILL talk to me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">04-18-2000, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My druid buddy Efgar and I were going through Lesser Fay the other day from MM.  He said, &quot;there's a weird rare out here.&quot;  It was Equestrielle, he'd never seen her, neither had I.<br />
<br />
We followed her around for a while.  She's really beautiful.  Behind us was a ranger - he was scoping her out for a kill.  After she walked away, we headed to our destination.  Made me happy tho, at least one other person enjoys the beauty in the game because it's nice, not because they can kill it and make a profit.</div></div><hr />
