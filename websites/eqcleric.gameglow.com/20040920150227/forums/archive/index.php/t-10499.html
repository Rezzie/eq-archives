<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throk</div><div class="date">03-07-2000, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello I am having some diff. trying to get out of lvl 23.  I tend to solo most of the time with my cleric, due to the times I play and wanting to be by myself a little.  I don't have a problem grouping just am tired of it for a while.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering is if there is a nice place to go that is fairly uncamped that I can solo some mobs at?  <br />
<br />
I have been to SK and the hermit is always camped and befallen is turning green for me, well at least the top 2 floors are.  Unrest is to under poped at the times I go to play and highkeep has long lines waiting for a group.  Went to sola and am indiff to the goblins there so kinda leary about ruining the faction there, but will do it if I feel it is worth it.  Tried Najina (sp?) but the darn greens keep attacking me.<br />
<br />
Oh well any info would be nice on spots to hunt at.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
