<br />
Lately we've been hunting the Troll Guards outside of Grobb. The XP is pretty good at level 40 &amp; 41. The XP does stop basically at level 45. Good platinum also, because the guards still drop Steel Long Swords. There's never really a lot of people there, at least I haven't seen any (this might not apply to all servers.) I actually detest hunting guards, but sometimes there really is no place to hunt at prime time.... though according to Verant this is not true. HA!<br />
<br />
Anyways, captilize on it if you want.. because I'm sure Verant will modify the Troll Guards to no longer drop Steel Swords.<br />

<br />
Based on this, is there anywhere else you might suggest a cleric go when they are on a Sol B or L Guk list for 5 hrs?? =)<br />
<br />
I know this game was based on groups, and I absolutely DETEST soloing, but sometimes there is no choice.<br />

<br />
I haven't been to Mistmoore, but there isn't many people there usually either.  Again, you will have to bring a group with you.<br />
<br />
Paw (see above).<br />
<br />
I truely enjoy the above zones a lot.  It's a shame they aren't used more.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cathawk</div><div class="date">04-10-2000, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only *slightly* feel bad for killing the guards. We only kill evil guards, because we belong to a goodly aligned guild. (We even removed one person for killing Dwarf Guards.)<br />
<br />
For places to solo, when you can't get a group: I'm able to to the single tree Spectre at Feerrott now (without a SOW) I can just sit there and duke it out with my spells, Fear and my HPs. And with a 6 minute spawn it's okay... but incrediably boring.<br />
<br />
Kithicor is great... a clerics paradise, but it has a long downtime... even more so, becuase you'll exhaust your mana very fast and have to med at night also.<br />
<br />
PAW is unique and challenging. I jump of the first bridge and very patiently solo blues. Bad thing is that you'll pull 2 sometimes. So I'll use fear and gate outside the PAW entrance and start over.. not worth dying. But jumping off the first bridge to the left is great. There are not that many clumped up Gnolls. Very very easy to fight singles. And a nice bonfire to rest up at that no roamers even go near.<br />

Am I some kind of freak?  I got wood the first time I killed a troll guard. =/</div></div><hr />
