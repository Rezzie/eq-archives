The strategy doesn't look to bad (Main tank with staggering Complete Heals) but some people in my guild are a little hesitant to fight him.<br />
<br />
On a our best nights we can field a solid 7 or 8 groups which includes:<br />
1 Level 60 Warrior<br />
3 or 4 Level 56+ Warriors<br />
2 or 3 Level 59+ Paladins<br />
5 or 6 56+ Clerics<br />
2 or 3 56 + Enchanters<br />
2 or 3 Level 60 Monks<br />
2 or 3 Level 60 Shamans<br />
<br />
For a FIRST attempt, how many people are we looking at?  We are on the verge of breaking into the very end game and I'm anxious to get there.  We have just had two very successful runs against Lord Alphabet in Velk's and I'm anxious to step up to the plate and go after some bigger fish.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Having only one level 60 warrior is probably your biggest problem as the fight will be longer than 3 mins - so you either have to keep healing the 60 after defensive runs out or try to get another (&lt;60) to take aggro wihtout Velk wiping a stack of light melee in the process.<br />
<br />
Best of luck - it is a fun fight.<br />

You will probably have to switch your 60 war out when defensive leaves though. Tanking him when he runs oom, without defensive, would waste a lot of mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">09-29-2001, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can get all ya clerics there, then defensive running out shouldn't be a big deal, you shouldn't be out of mana anyhow.  Just rearrange the delay at which you chain your CH's on your tank.<br />
<br />
Velks is easy because even if you die he regens at such a bad rate that he will be below 50% for a second fight, just as long as you reduce buffs to warriors, and clerics only (mana buffs for clerics mind :&gt;).<br />
<br />
He is not slowable, but he tends to nuke alot at the start (which is good).  Do not let anyone mana sieve him.  Get ya magicians to drop lots of mod rods on the floor for clerics to pick up when they get the oppurtunity.<br />
<br />
Also another little tip I found - turn trade off, if someone gives a cleric an item, be it a mod rod or a mistake, you will auto target them.  If you don't notice the main tank is toast.<br />
<br />
Also make sure that all of your tanks control their agro.  Make sure warriors who are not at the moment tanking do not have primary hand epics, and the like.  One unlucky proc and bang that tank is dead (heh one of our warriors picked up the rubbish 13/24 weapon off velks to use in fights before he was tanking :&gt;).</div></div><hr />
