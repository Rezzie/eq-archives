<br />
The outside of Chardok castle in Burning Woods is a fantastic XP spot for 44+. The castle is in the Northeast section of the zone, along the right zone wall from frontier Mountains.<br />
<br />
This is a Sarnak dungeon, and the outside of it has lots of fast respawns (6 minutes) for continuous pulling.<br />
<br />
The entry gate is a 4 spawn. Inside the courtyard are four doors, each with a 2 spawn. The second door from the left has a false wall with an additional spawn behind it, so two will come on a pull from the left hand Sarnak there.<br />
<br />
There are two divisions of outside Sarnaks, casters and melee. There are three roughly equivalant ranks within each division.<br />
<br />
approx lvl    melee          caster<br />
34-37         Knight         Enthusiast<br />
37-39         Champion       Extremist<br />
40-44         Avenger        Zealot<br />
<br />
The casters are gate-capable and will try to gate back to their spawn when below 25%. Extremists like to cast Scourge, and the Zealots like to cast an AoE poison rain, so keep RD/RP up or better yet get a necro to cast DMF.<br />
<br />
There is a named lvl 48 Shadowknight who is a random spawn in any of the Sarnak spots. He has a 600 point Harm Touch. Of the twenty-two times we have killed him, he has had the same drop every time. Runic Carver, MAGIC LORE 2HS 18/37 WAR/PAL/RNG/SHD. Thing looks HUGE, like the sword from Final Fantasy 7.<br />
<br />
Drops from the regular Sarnaks are about 5pp cash, with words/pages/runes and occaisional opals/emeralds/peridot.<br />
<br />
Best technique so far has been a harmony pull to the corners of the courtyard, with two people designated to snare/root if they start running. A runner that makes it to the gate means an evac.<br />
<br />
Our group has been 40-51 with about 20 hours pulling here, one death from a caster running out of heal range. On the other hand, I have done about 30 resses here for other groups. Have a good plan and do not die *grins*<br />

<br />
Also, if you can clear the gate fast enough, you can pull from further in and earn yourself a nice little XP fight with the Sarnak Avengers. Lots of HPs and they hit into the low 100s.<br />
<br />
There was a named Sarnak that was pulled last night. Was either a Necro or a Shadow Knight. We grossly underestimated it's power and had to evac. Conned red to me at level 44 and blue to our level 51 ranger. Was not carrying a sword of any kind... that was visibly noticeable.<br />

<br />
Avengers spawn on the outside as well, nice random distribution of mobs.<br />
<br />
The named fellow (Klyssal Kolasta or something like that) is a 48 SK. His sword is not a visible graphic but thus far has dropped every single time (22 kills). Since it is LORE we have had to come up with creative ways of looting it.<br />
<br />
If you are on Tribunal go visit the Priest of Discord in Rivervale to see him dual-wielding these freaking huge Runic Carvers...<br />
