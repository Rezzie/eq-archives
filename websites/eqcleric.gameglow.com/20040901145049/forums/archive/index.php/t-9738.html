<br />
&quot;There's a real good reason I never posted information on the sit-in as news: I find the whole idea embarrassing and personally abhorrent. The &quot;peaceful&quot; Seattle incident just solidifies my thinking on this subject. I find the 60s embarrassing. I could go on, but I think I've made my point.&quot;<br />
<br />
Are you clueless or just uneducated? You can take your fascist ideas and shove them ...<br />
<br />
A sit-in is abhorrent? Um, it's a way to get attention, doesn't hurt anyone...<br />
<br />
The 60s were emberassing? Get a clue, important social transformations took place in the 60s. Have you heard of Martin Luther King? A civil rights activist? He conducted peaceful marches and protests, was arrested many times...you remember or have heard of him right? Have you heard about the Vietnam war, people protested against a war this country never committed to? Yet at the same time 50,000 Americans died...<br />
<br />
As to the Seattle situation, there is no excuse for the violence and no excuse for the excesses of the police. Neither group can be excused, I hope they lock up a bunch of protesters for a long time and a bunch of police supervisors lose their jobs.<br />
<br />
I don't know where you are from in the world, but this is one of the most outrageous and uninformed statements I have ever seen in a public forum.<br />

<br />
Or would you rather I bitch slap you here as well?<br />
<br />
If you love your freedom, thank a VET!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smikkey</div><div class="date">12-03-1999, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These two posts hack me off.  Ive read every post regarding this sit in and realize everyone has a strong view.<br />
<br />
That being said, you two (Military and YoLa) need to be a little more polite in you damn posts.  These are not the proper way to state your views.  You are the ones to be b_____ slapped.<br />
<br />
You owe Rayne an apology.  If for no other reason then thinking about the time invested by Rayne for our benefit, he deserves more respect then you have given.<br />
<br />
Shame on you.</div></div><hr />

I know what I would like to call him, but I'm not stooping to his level.<br />

I should not have generalized and denounced every protest ever held.<br />
<br />
I could explain myself further, but at this point I'm really disinterested in seeing this thread continue.<br />
<br />
Military Advisor: your response was over the top also.  I admit, however, that I have read almost every Heinlein book written.<br />
<br />
Traveling Poet:  you were absolutely correct to close the thread.  I made the decision to move it, respond, and if they REALLY FEEL THE NEED they can respond also.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
