<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had something very sad happen last night and I wanted to relate it you you all and ask a question.<br />
<br />
I was arriving at lower guk and got a tell from a res friend.<br />
<br />
You know, a res friend.  One of those folks who calls on you for resses because you ressed him once, they always exchange buffs and such and is really nice and polite but you only know them from ressing, not from ever grouping with them.  You know, a res friend.  *chuckle*<br />
<br />
Anways, this res friend sends a tell.  He got killed at the lord room duing a big Dar pull and wanted to ask if he could get a res.  He mixed in a little complaint that he died with two cleircs in the group.  I asked about it and apparently he had two 40+ cleircs in the group and both went OOM from nuking and could not heal him while he (a chanter) got pounded into dust towards the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
I thought this was strange and started heading down to res him.<br />
<br />
When I arrived I find that his group has two clerics in the cleirc robes from Kunark.  So I ressed him and sat next to the group a while to med up and check on a few friends to find a group for the evening.<br />
<br />
The two cleircs did indeed dump what appeared to be all of their mana on nuking every fight.  It was interesting to watch.  They dressed up in robes and were acting like a couple of mages.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I was a little suprised that anyone could die in such a controlled situation because both clerics were nuking full time with no reserve for healing.  I found it disheartening.<br />
<br />
The reason I found it disheartening is that this type of event is exactly what gives the negative &quot;Battle Cleirc&quot; image to most folks.  Clerics can so a lot more than just heal, we are incredible sources of utility spells (stuns, roots, soem nukes, etc).  But it has to be targeted to always be focused on keeping the group alive.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I was just curious, is the &quot;Robed Cleric&quot; the semi-official &quot;I'm going to act like a wizard&quot; standard now? If you see a robe, don't expect a heal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure.  I haven't been in very many other groups with other clerics so I haven't experienced that yet.  The few instances where I have been with other clerics, I haven't had a problem with them nuking too much and not saving any for heals.  The weekend before this last, I grouped with a 46 cleric in Karnor's and he would nuke down to about 40 % and then save for heals which was fine with me as I was being primary healer.<br />
<br />
sounds like a couple of strange ducks to me.<br />

<br />
That means there were 2 cleric and 1 caster.  So what were the other classes in the group?  And during this fight was it their job to take the roll of 'Nuker'.<br />
Also, did they die as well?<br />
<br />
I believe in the 'Battle Cleric' for a short period of melee and as a great nuker towards the undead.<br />
<br />
This guy might have over nuked and got agro'd on.  Who knows...<br />

Thought it was pretty slick so I gave it to my newbie cleric. When in a group I tend to only nuke when I have a surplus of mana and am not expecting to do a lot of healing right away. In fact it's been joked at a few times I don't nuke &quot;enough&quot; hehe. I wouldn't take the fact that they were wearing robes into account. They were simply two individuals who clicked cleric on accident instead of wizard on the creation screen and haven't figured it out yet. =)<br />

Often, it is to hide what i am really wearing.  (got to be sneaky on PvP servers)  Yes, i have on occasion 'disguised' myself as a mage to avoid the constant begging, but wearing a robe does not mean i believe i am a mage.  I would also like to have the Burynai Legion Gi, but its just a fashion thing, a different disguise for travel.  Please dont assume all robe wearing clerics are incompetent healers.  <br />

<br />
That in no way permits us to overnuke. In fact, with most fights being a lot safer with two clerics, we usually finish most of the fight with around 40 mana left. We don't nuke much unless required to, but rather chain stun to support our group.<br />
<br />
So, to answer your original question, no, just because a cleric has a robe on, doesn't mean he/she is going to be a nuker solely  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I had one for a little while and sold it to someone higher level for 400plat.  Seemed a good deal since the place it came from was low blues to green and seemed to be a pretty common drop.  It's funny because it's all the rage on my server right now.  You can tell someone is a cleric becuase of the robe.  I wear my quest armor now to set me apart!  In fact, I get more compliments on the armor than the robe (Server is a little young though -Lanys-)  Only problem with the quest armor is that I get begged from more because &quot;I look rich&quot; (Real quote from a begger)<br />
<br />
Anyway, on my server most Clerics wear a BS Tunic or the Gi.  If anyting sets me apart or looks good, it's the quest armor not the Gi.<br />
<br />
Although, I wouldn't mind getting a robe of the seeker and equiping a parrying dagger to run through the newbie zones  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I just do not understand the fashion thing.<br />
<br />
When I need AC I pop on a cleric breastplate or a BEBP.  <br />
<br />
When I need wisdom I pop on a runed mithril tunic.<br />
<br />
The Gi is 14 ac and some +mana.<br />
<br />
I see people wearing the Gi for &quot;fashion&quot; I guess when they have not hit 200 mana.  Just my opinion but they would be better served by getting a mixed AC/wisdom item like the BS Tunic or go for Wis or AC appropriately.  Seems weird to wear a key piece (chest slot) that is not giving you the maximum benefit from the slot.  *shrug*<br />
<br />
I worry more about my effectivness than fashion.  Must be because I'm a dwarf (grin).  Funny, the only folks I've ever seen in the robes are high elves.  Explains a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's face it, when you're a dark elf your banking/selling ports are a little limited, especially while hunting around Omen so you do what you can to get around encumberance restrictions.<br />
<br />
As for using the robes as a sign of a &quot;bad&quot; cleric? A stereotype.<br />

<br />
The Mines of Nurga. It's an upper mid-level dungeon on Kunark that can be entered from the Frontier Mountains. Drops of various Burnyai there.<br />

How is the Robe a fashionable item? I'm proud of the fact that I am a Cleric. It's funny, clerics use to complain about looking like a druid, but now think it's cool to like like a caster? I personally don't care to blend in and look like a caster. When I want fashion, I rotate my chestpiece from Cleric Gold, to Mithril Blue to Black Enam, and hopefully one day to Purple planar. <br />

Choosing to look like a druid is one thing, being &quot;forced&quot; to look like a druid is quite another.  For a long time, there really weren't all that many options to a cleric, who wanted to maximize their wisdom.  They had to run around with various pieces of armor that looked like leather.<br />
<br />
I guess fashion isn't just about changing the tint of your your clothes (in your case your breastplate), and is more about looking &quot;unique&quot;?  I don't know the answer to this one, but I know that fashion isn't wearing 3 identical breastplates with different colors.  =P  It's more about going for a new look, or doing something that no one else has done before.<br />
<br />
I have several distinct outfits depending on the situation and my mood.  &gt;=)  If I want to impersonate a wizard, I wield my Staff of Forbidden Rites, put on my Efreeti boots, sebilite scale gloves (passes quite nicely for carmine gloves), and don my Robe of Seekers.  Then I walk around emoting &lt;Starts to cast Ice Comet&gt;, then say BOOM!  I do it in jest and in fun, to entertain myself and those around me.  Plus, it's nice to look different every now and then.<br />
<br />
P.S. All of the above works for an enchanter as well except swap the Robe for a Gi, the SoFR for a primsatic shield and a mug, then cast Hammer of Unswerving Faith on something.  You'll get tells for clarity soon nuff.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  (Heck I used to get tells for clarity with my Robe of Seekers on!)<br />

<br />
Just as a side note:  I've never seen a dorf in this robe, and actually I think either a) its class restricted so dorfs can't wear them, or b) dorfs don't get the cool graphic.<br />
<br />
Either way, would any self respecting dorf be caught in a dress?  ;=)  High elf female clerics, now there's fashion!</div></div><hr />

Verant was too lazy to create a robe graphic for halflings and for dwarves (not dorfs) so we won't be able to wear any robes. <br />

<br />
 When i'm running around.. maybe soloing, or what not.. I wear my robes(especially when I'm medding).. if I really need that extra few mana from the few points of wis or other bonus's.. I'll throw my Tunic on, but really<br />
<br />
 I'm sick of looking like i'm 4th level just to get my 200 wis.. So I like throwing on a robe.. and people ask me all the time what class I am, or what is the robe.. and that is just the seeker robe.. <br />
 <br />
 I can't wait to get the Gi, and the rungal regrowth robes.. That will look great!!<br />
<br />
 but it is an easy fashion change without sacrificing all my wis.. If I wear my cleric armor.. I sacrifice a BUNCH of mana.. with the robes.. I don't sacrifice as much, because I only need to change 1 piece, and they actually have some form of mana on them.. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Not many people see a person wearing a robe, and a plate helm.. best look yet, is a dark elf with rubi boots, helm, and gauntlets with the seeker robe on.. <br />
<br />
<br />
just an opinion from the darker side of the fashion police  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
Also - less 1st level twerps following me and begging for Symbol of Naltron (I kid you not).  Of course, if they see my husband is an enchanter, it's either clarity or Rune IV.  Right.<br />
<br />
So my robe is only worn for disguise.  I wear my crude stein and a darkwood staff and merrily wander.  Most people can't see the gold hands and feet and my helm doesn't show.</div></div><hr />

I wear my robe when I want lots of extra mana.  I can get my wisdom to 200 without a tunic, put on the robe, there is more mana...
