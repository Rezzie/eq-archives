<br />
We are now a Time flagged guild, and as such will be focusing on Time and GoD.  When the new expansion comes out we will stick our noses in there too.<br />
<br />
Don't be shy if your gear is not the best or  you are missing EP flags,  we will help you get this all sorted out.<br />
<br />
Shoot me a tell in game if you like :)<br />
