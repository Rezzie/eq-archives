<br />
Just a few of the many many reasons why EQ has pissed me off:<br />
<br />
#1: EQ is deceptively marketed.<br />
<br />
How many of you realized you were buying a <br />
MUD, or a game that could only be played online, when you first bought the product? Even after reading the manual this was not clear to me, and nothing on the box mentions anything of the sort. Personally I thought I was buying an RPG.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this one sets the stage for all the disappointment that follows.<br />
<br />
#2: EQ is a broken and incomplete product. <br />
<br />
Every single class has broken spells, abilities, and skills. Nowhere are you warned that these things are broken before you die trying to use them. Being a cleric, paladin, etc. really has nothing to do with this, things are broken across the board. For a good example, try taking a pet-dependent class into a dungeon. Or say these two words: Kedge Keep. Or get killed through a wall.<br />
<br />
EverQUEST? Quests in EQ are almost universally (a) a waste of time and effort, or (b) broken. Why bother questing when you can fairly reliably assume this?<br />
<br />
#3: EQ documentation is pathetic and insulting to the paying customer.<br />
<br />
This is done, of course, to cover up the extensive incompetence in the implementation of their &quot;vision&quot;. It is also done to allow them to arbitrarily and dramatically change the game at a whim. I know of no other product which operates in such a manner (except maybe Windows). Selling &quot;hint&quot; manuals is a scam to bilk customers out of extra dollars. Where's the documentation on the &quot;yield rule&quot; for example? Where's the documentation on the things that get people banned?<br />
<br />
#4: For all the hype about grouping, the game design creates huge barriers to grouping.<br />
<br />
Unless you can dedicate a regular time to journey with a regular group, you will encounter at the minimum either (a) prohibitively long journeys to join your group in some far-off zone; or (b) some members of the group will advance faster than others which will force the breakup of even the most regular group. For me, I can play EQ every now and again. Not every night from 8pm to 12pm. The artificial and inexplicable system of levels and xp, and the severe power imbalance between players and NPCs (why can green mobs hit me for more damage than I can do them? why do they have more HP than I do?) is at the core of this problem.<br />
<br />
#5: For all the hype about &quot;balance&quot;, balanced this game is not.<br />
<br />
Insert rant about druids here. The Uberclass royally screws all the reasons we are force-fed to coerce us into grouping with strangers. Don't blame the powergamers, they are only being who they are.<br />
<br />
#6: The EQconomy.<br />
<br />
Gimme a break! What economy? A post-nuclear war Russia would have a more efficient economy than EQ. Who the heck has 1200 plat for a potion of gate? I also doubt that there is any supply/demand code at all. Buying a lot of an item will not cause any merchant to stock or produce more of the item in the future. If the trade skills were anything but a waste of time, players would be able to produce on their own most of the goods availible from merchants. That is, when trade skills are not broken (see above). Alchemy?<br />
<br />
#7: EQ is in HUGE need of a competent graphic designer.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, amateur fansites have better graphics. Repeating tiled vector images get realllllllly boring since it's not 1985 and Elite (heh who remembers that game) is no longer state-of-the-art. Since all the art is client-side, not server side, there is no excuse for this (HINT RENDERED GRAPHICS HINT HINT).<br />
<br />
#8: EQ has a miserable fun/hour ratio.<br />
<br />
No I have not come up with a way to measure fun. I'm just sick of waiting for HP, waiting for mana, waiting until I reach the zone, waiting for zones to load, waiting for monsters to spawn, waiting for quests to be fixed, waiting for spells to be fixed, waiting for that rare special item/spawn to pop up. Waiting to follow the worms.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is by no means a complete list of the irritants that have built up during my EQ playing days, just the ones that come to me right now at this moment.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the length. I actually made a few good relationships with other players, but this is no credit to Verant. It is with much sadness that I said goodbye.<br />
<br />

<br />
#9: Corpse recovery!<br />
<br />
How the hell is one supposed to roleplay this one? I can't think of any reason for this other than a premeditated and deliberated waste of time.<br />
<br />
#10: Crowds<br />
<br />
The EQ world is simply not big enough for the number of players on each server. The optimal number of players on a server is 500-700. 1000 means every good spot is taken. 1500 means that you spend more time waiting for another group to leave so you can hunt than you actually do hunting. And 2000... my lord. I have seen this number before, thankfully not on servers I played. I pity those who face that problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can they expect us to sit and wait for an item or a certain mob to appear for 7-8 hours in real time?!<br />
<br />
(I'm doing a Testament of Vanear quest, the guard is 8-hour spawn and there are always a few people waiting for him)<br />
<br />
It just makes me not want to do quests at all. If only some people (who have lots and lots of time to abandon) can do those quests, what's the point of having them at all?<br />
<br />
Recently I'm having a feeling that they want us to play *longer* so we pay money, not for fun. Everything seems to point in that direction.<br />

Bottom center it says internet connection required. On the back top it says a 3d Massivly multiplayer fatansy role-playing game. Hmm that sounds like a mud to me except the 3d part. <br />
As far as i know all the spells i have work acroding to how they say in the manual. ohh wait it doesnt mention about skills or spells in the manual. So how do you how a spell or skill is supposed to work? I agree EQ needs work and there are some buggy areas but so is every mud i ever played. btw Kedge is still under test and is considered a beta dungeon. <br />
<br />
I agree the manual is bad but you have the best manual you can get. Web sites have way more information than you could ever put on paper.<br />
<br />
I never had problems with grouping but as a good cleric i always had alot of invite from groups and i was ahead of the level curve so there was never alot of people in the same dungeon as there is now. <br />
<br />
You can rant about druids but they are just as balenced as anyone else. They are just good at alot of things instead of haveing one thing they are really good at.<br />
<br />
I see some effort from Verant to get rid of some of the cash in the game IE those potions. At level 50 you can make a couple hundred plat a day easy so i dont see how things can get too expensive. <br />
<br />
I havent seen an online game that can support 1000+ people that has better graphics. Nuff said<br />
<br />
I still enjoy my hours very much so at level 50 and dont see that having to wait for simple things like mana and hps a valid concern. <br />
<br />
Corpse retrival is meant to be somthing to make you think about dieing. Its a recourse. If there was no penalty to dieing then people wouldnt care if they died or not.<br />
<br />
Crowds is a problem. 1200 is about the most that should be on a server at once. Even with the 2 new zones it shouldnt go higher than maybe 1300. 1800-2000+ is over crowded to say the least. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I cetainly knew exactly what I was buying when I purchased the game.  Perhaps a lot of your problem with EQ can be solved by the following solutions:<br />
1. Play with friends.  I play with a group of real-life friends, in addition to the friends I have made in my guild.  This helps the game along, making it a chance to talk and share some quality time with good people rather than a game about killing that monster, looting it, then moving on.  The real-life friends is not always possible, so try to find people who play when you do.<br />
<br />
2. Take some computer classes.  I am currently in school for a degree in Computer Information Systems.  I understand the great difficulty in developing a product, bringing it to market, helping it grow, then beating the competition. I have plenty of gripes with the game and my class, but I still think this is the best game on the market at this time.<br />
<br />
3. It's not all that bad.  As a veteran of many offline RPG's and OSI's Ultima Online, let me tell you that Verant has done a very nice job with EverQuest thus far. Yes, th graphics could be better.  BUT, would you like to chop and lag your way through a game? Now perhaps you have a kick ass PC, but by far the averagem person playing EQ does not. They have those underpowered boxed PC's that are really affordable and really underpowered.  So, games must keep their technology in the range of the &quot;average&quot; person's PC.  <br />
<br />
4.  Corpse recovery.  Yes, it stinks.  BUT, I for one am just glad to have the chance to get all my stuff back.  Coming from UO, if I died, the cockroaches in the woodwork (pk's or other &quot;oppotunists) would swarm my body like a cockroach to food.  I have diedin many places that I would just assume let my corpse rot as get it back, but the fact that I can die and not have to dread losing all my stuff keeps me somewhat happy (and my blood pressure down).<br />
<br />
I know there are others reasons, but my time is limited.  Everquest is a good game, but it is NOT a prefect game.  NO game is perfect, nor is there likely to ever be a perfect game.  So, you have every right to rant away, that is the purpose of this site.  And, we can all tell you how you are wrong (just as people will tell me how I am wrong).  And perhaps, someone out there will be listening and either make EQ better, or design and market there own game.  That is the nature of this industry and is what makes the Internet and online gaming great.<br />

You think they wanted to trick people into buying it who didn't have internet access? Seriously?<br />
<br />
#2. No game is perfect. Try solitaire.<br />
#3. Documentation? I didnt even know the game came with any. <br />
#4. Wow...I have to go anon just to get in a little solo time with my twinks. <br />
#5. The game is balanced pretty well in my opinion.<br />
#6. The economy is great. The vendors sell the bare minimum of survival goods. All important items are moved via a player economy. I personally get the items I want.<br />
#7. The art is fine.  I love it.<br />
#8. Hmmm. Fun/Hour. Lets see, 3 months plus played time in the 8 months its been out..I'd say I'm pretty much a junkie. Perhaps solitaire?<br />
#9. CR? I die sometimes. I have been known to think, &quot;gee next time maybe I ought to die in a safer place.&quot; Then, I go get my body.<br />
#10. Crowds? You got me there. Crowds do suck. They need to delete 300 characters randomly from every server. (but seriously, they could thin the herd by using 1-9 above to get rid of the whiners)<br />

<br />
A long-time mudder friend of mine said this- and personally I also ascribe to this.  If you were a mudder before this game was either the reason you stopped playing the text muds so intensely or it's the reason you started mudding again.  The graphics side is what we all wanted way back when.  On the other hand, as a LP-MUD, frankly, it's a second rater- a decent first attempt at a mud, but hardly (WITHOUT THE GRAPHICS) a competitor of the top muds out there.  The crew has made obvious newbie mud imp mistakes repeatedly.  It also suffers from a corporate run marketing office - namely that it promises far more than it delivers.  Both of these cause disillusionment- and lets face it: we play this game for its ability to generate the illusion of doing these fantastic things.  People have every right to bitch about incomplete code and things not working the way the marketing says it does.  Now, if the game was free... do you think that most of these people would be bitching?  I doubt it.  I know I wouldnt be.<br />
Paying gives them the right to complain.<br />
<br />
EQ has zero potential if it is run as it is now in a three-to-four year time frame.  Success in getting 250,000 users to shell out the $8-10 per month, and $50 to start out will breed competition.  Asheron's Call is but the first of many.  Consider that buying the Quake II engine is what $125,000 and 10% of the game price- connect it with a well-developed mud- with classes that have stood the test of time- and whose imp would be overawed with something a tenth the size of that- you'd be 2/3 of the way to a competing product.  The only thing EQ will have going for it in a few years is FUD- fear, uncertainty, and doubt.  It is NOT a good MUD. It is however, first to market with 3D graphics and the first person perspective that long-time mud addicts long craved, and it was the first multi-user dungeon that I know of to go over 1000 people online simultaneously- Most of the muds I was on were considered huge with 120 people on.  They do a fair job of keeping lag down.  But that's it really.  Playable and first-to-market....<br />
<br />
I realize this is quite a bit off topic of clerics- but so were some of these posts, especially from the defenders of EQ- old-time mudders: strip away the graphics and the original setting.  Then look at EQ as a MUD.  Put it in a text-only context- would you play?  I wouldnt.  I play because of those two factors - graphics and world design.  When a better backbone comes along- I and my RL friends will be gone.  <br />
<br />
AGAIN:<br />
EQ sucks as a MUD. Too bad it's so damn cool.<br />
<br />
Verant will get what's coming to them in the end.  Their short-sightedness will catch up with them (or more likely the next guy to take it over as BMQ will likely move onto another project and let someone else take the fall for this one when it falls apart)</div></div><hr />
