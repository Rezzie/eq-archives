</FONT><HR>I was just wondering if anyone else out here in cleric land gets as frustraited as I at times.  The guild which I am a member of is semi large, during peak hours a /who all guild is cut short but the level ranges from 55 to 12.<P>I am normally THE cleric who goes with all the nutty warriors to the dungeons and helps all those who have managed to die somehow.<P>"There are sharks that quad attack and debuff with every attack?  How many bodies are there?"<P>Yes I did manage to drag all those bodies lol.  <P>But recently I've been getting a bit annoyed with the people which I play with.  We operate as a regular group 75% of the time.  And if someone needs/wants something we pool resources and time to help them quest/camp <shudder>/buy when we can.<P>It just seems to me that as of late, Im kinda the odd man out.  Ive given away who knows how many items and x ammount of plat to help fund the warriors "Ineedthatweapon" foundation.  I left town for the weekend and the group went to skyshrine to raise a little hell.<P>A friend of mine instantly tells me when I get in game saying<P>"Man we got a TON of your vellious spells the other day in skyshrine!"<P>I am instantly stoked, they knew I was looking for all these spells and told me that they would be going to SkyShrine over the weekend to "hook me up" so they said.<P>So an hour goes by and the friend with all the spells finally logs on.  Hastily I send him a tell asking him how skyshine went.  He replies that it was "so so" and they "didnt get much, and what they did get they lost."<P>Apparently this guy died earlier that day in Wakening Lands, he traded ALL the spells of mine for a res from a cleric who was bound there......<P>damnit.<P>Just isnt my day, but Im sure it will come<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Gniss, try three guilds  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>But these are my friends... just they're so <B>DEDICATED</B> to the game that it's like a job to them. I mean, if I want to do something, I feel obligated to drop what I'm doing and help them. If I don't help them, I get lower on the list of people to help. They may not say this outright, but I know it's true because for the few times I've put my foot down, I've gotten tells from various key members trying to guilt trip me about my decisions. It's not just a game to these specific members... it's their life's work. I know the clerics browse this board. They know what I'm talking about but they won't post confirming it. I'm very open about the situations.<P>I do a lot of things too that may merit being dragged by my ear to places... but at the same time, I've helped people countless times. When I want private time, certain people tend to forget that and see me as only going on raids where class loot drops, or going on a raid that would directly benefit myself. This isn't true. I drop everything to resurrect people who make idiotic mistakes like dying to seafuries in the ocean of tears and not binding there. I've helped people with their epics and have gone far out of my way to help younger clerics get spells... I GAVE a Celestial Healing spell to one of our younger clerics even after I was offered 10k for it. <P>I'm venting my frustrations here and I really shouldn't. If they see this, I'll probably be hanged. I understand that I'm a cleric and that I'm a "required" class for a raid, but I get really really <B>REALLY</B> tired of raiding after two straight weeks.

</FONT><HR>Georgia, I'd have to go along with those who suggest leaving the guild.<P>EQ is (supposed to be) a leisure activity.  Fun.<P>Honestly, it sounds like you're not having fun anymore, and because of your guild.  From your posts, it sounds like your guild is just using you to help them out, and that your desires are meaningless.  Afraid to logon?  People threatening to quit the guild because you want to do something different?<P>You don't need any of that.  Just explain that your goals are no longer the same as the guild's, and bow out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>/rant on<BR>I know exactly what people mean by getting pressurred into things. Im a 36 cleric and my guild did a raid on Lguk. i logged on about 2 hours after the raid started and didnt really have much intrest in going (had a lot of bad luk in guk) anyway i pop on and say "hi" well i was almost instantly talked into coming to join the group that was loosing there cleric. I died 3 times trying to get to where they were. invis has a nasty habbit of wereing off at the worst time well my corpse recovery wasnt going very well and the sk trying to help me got pissed off at me like it was my fault that things werent going smoothly. all told i lost 4 yellow bubbles of exp and think that i was the one with the right to be pissed. oh yeah and another rant. doing the sarnaks out in OT we were in a group of 6 and we were extremely efficant i barely had to heal much and the mage kept asking for pynzarn. i told her that i wasnt even giving the tanks the symbol and told her it cost a jasper every cast. then she said " I know how much it costs i play a cleric too you know" if she played a cleric then she should know the only times you give casters the symbol line is when breaking a tough spawn or going into pvp.<BR>/rant off</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ravoneste, wait til you're 49+... that's when the fun starts and you don't live your own life anymore... you start being a guild healing/rezzing mule that they don't have to buy an extra computer to log the character on to... they can just use you to do all of the work. <P>I'm stuck in level 54... I want to get out and hit level 56... can't do it. I think I'm going to go guildless until I hit 60. It's a goal that I want to reach and I can do it easily without raiding and the like. I'd enjoy raiding more also if it didn't take 2 hours to get things started... in my world, that isn't optimal. I don't like raiding during the weekdays because I have work the next morning. I was up til 12:20am last night trying to help them on a raid, only to have one of the members tell me: "STFU you f*cking wh*re". Granted most of them are college kids, and are able to stay up during the wee hours of the night, I can't do this and they fail to see it and understand it every single time I tell them. <P>They say to come when I get online and stay for however long I can... but don't send someone to pick me up, then they yell at me when I don't get there fast enough. It's highly annoying. I know they're reading this right now... maybe they'll see this and understand my position as a working adult, but I doubt it. <P>I like my guild... the people are great, funny, and nice guys... but when they get into the mood to raid every night of the week, I am scared to log on because I'll get dragged by my ears to do something that I honestly don't want to do. <P>Most probably think I only go to Hate raids, which is completely false. I don't go on any raids if I'm not in the mood... as a matter of fact, they hit Hate about two weeks ago and I refused to go... mostly because they only had one tank and hadn't researched the new plane.<P>------------------<BR>Georgia Gaelicmyst<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Everlore Staff Member<BR>http://www.everlore.com/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hey Georgia, I have to agree with Tarf.<P>I sympathize with your plight. I'm a 49 cleric myself and once I hit that, the rezzing hasn't stopped. But the different is, I'm lucky enough to belong to a guild where we all realize that cleric's can't always drop what we're doing and run off on a rez at a moment's notice.<P>If someone dies and there are no free clerics, that decision is respected.<P>And if there IS a free cleric, usually other guildmates will provide free transportation to and from the corpse.<P>Same with hunting. My guild was formed without any goal in mind except as a gathering of friends. That means all individuals are free to group or not group as they want. And no one, I repeat, NO ONE gives you any grief about it.<P>Your friends don't sound very nice to me.<BR>They don't even sound like friends.<P>I hope you hit 56 soon. And I hope you find some friends who will appreciate your individual choices because like we've all said before, it's only a game.<P>Landeth</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>Georgia, <P>  You don't have to put up with that.  The fastest way to fix the problem is /guildremove.  I've been through this to a certain extent, and I'm NOT doing it.  I work 40 hours a week, married, and have a child.  I'm not putting these people in front of my RL.  Right before the new year, it was crazy.  We were raiding every night.  Enchanter epics, monk epics, sk epics, shaman epics, planes raids.  I finally got burned out and said "enough".<BR>  My guild respects my decsion to play an alt and/or limit my hours when playing my cleric.  A few have tried to guilt me into going, but I just told them to start a cleric.  That quiets them down pretty quickly.  If someone ever cursed at me like that, I'd either /guildremove them on the spot, send them packing (I love translocate), or I'd gate out and camp.  I don't care how old you are, you don't talk to people like that. Period.<P>  Who cares if they kick you out?  It's so so easy to get a pickup group as a cleric at your level, and I'd imagine that it'd be equally easy to find a guild that would treat you with a little more respect.  It sounds like they need you more than you need them.<P><BR>Rizena Halcyon<BR>Templar of the Mithril Tower<BR>Ayonae Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Actually Georgia, I was kind of hoping you'd respond that way.  What I'm shooting for is that you come to a reconciliation between your desires (game wise that is) and your guild's.  I figured if I pissed you off a bit you might think beyond my tweaking you and direct your emotions where they rightfully belong.<P>I KNOW it's not a troll for attention, but it is very sad.  You've had a string of posts now complaining about your guild.  However, you still don't seem to recognize that there's a problem that seriously needs to be addressed.  So you complain about your guild while simultaneously defending them.  You brought up the example from one person, not me.<P>I need to take more time to reply to you, but do not have it right now (workmen are outside wondering what happened to me).<P>I guess the best thought I can leave you with is this: you have made a number of complaints that distill down to your goals and those of your guild mates are not in sync.  It's up to you to reconcile that, not your guild mates.  They, according to what you have posted, are happy doing what they do (ie. raids).  You, on the other hand, wish to do less of it.  SO, do less and stay in the guild, or if the pressure from them is too much, leave.<P>Rayne<BR>PS. If someone in a guild I belonged to ever told me that there would be one less guildmember (them or me).<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>LOA is a family guild.  Not only are we a close bunch of people, even though we span many games, but we CARE about eachother in game and out.<P>We celebrate births, mourn losses, donate to carities, get together in real life and too many other things to name off the top of my head.<P>For these reasons we are not 'uber'.  We go on one raid every week or so.  We dont require applicants to be of class, level or race, simply to be honorable and caring.<P>Yes we have had people leave us because we offered to little for the post 50s (though this is slowly changing).  Of course I watch the message boards of the guilds they joined and was horrified to see how their constant raiding was destroying REAL LIVES.  Not just the members but the members families were falling apart.  Very very disturbing and sad.  <P>EQ is a GAME.  You play it to get enjoyment.  Should you not be finding that, take a step back and look at what YOU need. <BR>Your guild should directly reflect what you need.<P>I am very proud of my guild.  And while we are not Uber in the sense of loots or raids, we are in friends.<BR> <P>------------------<BR>~Calimayrn Anam'Cara<BR>49th Cleric of Tunare<BR>~Calizana Rhinelander<BR>Floating Barbarian Champion<BR><A HREF="http://www.lostorder.com" TARGET=_blank>Lost Order of Akalabeth</A><BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

The same rules apply to asking for guild ports.  <P>We also respect each other's desires to play alternates from time to time.

</FONT><HR>In our guild, if our cleric's are available for a rez, then they do it, if not they don't. Same for druids with ports, etc. We ask over guildchat first, then if noone is available at the time, we look elsewhere. I personally am happy it's like this, because I don't want to have to leave a killer group just to go rez someone a continent away.
