<br />
What, did the drawing department take a week off when they made these?<br />
<br />
Are these supposed to be like black ice on a highway, don't see 'em until you run into 'em?<br />
<br />
For like the last two weeks, I've been running THROUGH shadowman camps before I realized they're smacking me already, and these things are faster than SoW, and NASTY. One isn't a problem, but if you run through a pack of 7, ok, even getting gates off gets difficult.<br />
<br />
Last night, I ran through not one shadowman camp, but TWO! I can never remember exactly where they are in Lavastorm anyway.. Some hilltop somewhere, and it's smack between the zone and the druid gate - I also manage to somehow find these stupid guys when heading to najena. <br />
<br />
I've not been killed yet from this, but cmon! Enough is enough! Put a graphic on these things! This is like having invisible griffons jumping on people!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baerum</div><div class="date">04-14-2000, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um...hehe they are SHADOWS. They are invisible. I think they may have a slight blue light to give them away now, but if you ever get a see invis take a look, they are there. If you look to the monolith (or temple or icon!  they are ALWAYS near some sort of marker) you will likely not see them, but their pets. <br />
<br />
Since they are always in clearly marked camps I can't for the life of me see how you happen to run into them unknowingly. The first time I saw them after they were added I was a necro. I saw their pets but niothing else, then I cast deadeye! Yikes. I belive they are no longer invisible so that melee classes and clerics could fight them for their ro temple faction without need of se invis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I trip over the ones in SK and Lavastorm all the time....<br />
<br />
And guess what! We get a SHADOWMAN PET! Muahaha!<br />
