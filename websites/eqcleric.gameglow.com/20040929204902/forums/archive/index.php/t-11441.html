<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mocca</div><div class="date">08-31-2002, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. Last time I could blame sleep deprivation as the cause of my unusual behavior. As Sssindd and Kitla knows me, I am a fairly easy going helpfull person. (/tickle Sssindd and Kitla).<br />
<br />
The scene : I was bumming around one day in the afternoon and decided to go say hello to a friend of mine in Highpass, and to slaughter a few orcs for pure pleasure. Seen as I am in no hurry I catch the spires down to North Karana, and run towards the wooden bridge to East Karana. I zone into East Karana to have this amusing conversation. I was in a very good mood at the time and just felt like playing with someone's head...<br />
<br />
Stupid_01 : Hello…<br />
Mocca : Hi, who’s this?<br />
Stupid_01 : This is stupid_01<br />
<br />
/w all Stupid People<br />
&lt;55 Class&gt; Stupid_01 (race) <br />
- (don't wanna give the person away to much)<br />
<br />
Mocca : Oh… do I know you?<br />
Stupid_01 : Um… don’t think so…<br />
Mocca : Oh, ok…bye<br />
Stupid_01 : Wait!<br />
Mocca : What?<br />
Stupid_01 : Can you rez me?<br />
Mocca : Sorry running to meet someone.<br />
Stupid_01 : No your not…<br />
Mocca : &lt;looks at ground zooming past&gt; yes I am…<br />
Stupid_01 : You were just here!<br />
Mocca : Where?<br />
Stupid_01 : Here…<br />
Mocca : You said that already, I have been here, there, and many other places today…<br />
Stupid_01 : You just came down the spires.<br />
Mocca : Oh yes, I remembered that, nice in-flight movie.<br />
Stupid_01 : So, can you rez me?<br />
Mocca : Am I there now?<br />
Stupid_01 : No.<br />
Mocca : There you go…<br />
Stupid_01 : What?<br />
Mocca : Huh?<br />
<br />
** 5 minute break**<br />
<br />
Stupid_01 : Can you rez me?<br />
Mocca : We went thru this before…<br />
<br />
** 1 minute pause**<br />
<br />
Stupid_01 : Can you rez me?<br />
Mocca : Am I standing infront of you?<br />
Stupid_01 : No.<br />
Mocca : So how can I rez you then?<br />
Stupid_01 : You can run back…<br />
Mocca : Yeah…well… you see that’s not the way my trip was planned.<br />
Stupid_01 : But I died!<br />
Mocca : That’s normally the reason people send me tells…<br />
Stupid_01 : I need the xp back!<br />
Mocca : Why did you die?<br />
Stupid_01 : I attacked the scion…<br />
Mocca : Why?<br />
Stupid_01 : Coz I wanted to see if it killed me…<br />
Mocca : It worked!<br />
Stupid_01 : Now I need a rez…<br />
Mocca : Why’d you die without a cleric friend close?<br />
Stupid_01 : Coz you were here then.<br />
Mocca : But I am not there now.<br />
Stupid_01 : Can you come back?<br />
Mocca : No.<br />
Stupid_01 : Why not?<br />
Mocca : Coz I am now 2 zones away.<br />
Stupid_01 : Why did you keep running away?<br />
Mocca : To meet my friends…<br />
Stupid_01 : But I was talking to you…<br />
Mocca : Yes, I am very talented can run and listen at the same time.<br />
Stupid_01 : Why didn’t you come back.<br />
Mocca : The keys wouldn’t let me turn around, only go straight.<br />
Stupid_01 : Petition then, EQ is bugged for you.<br />
Mocca : Can you petition for me? If you can get the GM to help me I will come back and rez you.<br />
Stupid_01 : Ok. Can you do it for free then if I get your keyboard fixed?<br />
Mocca : Sure!<br />
Stupid_01 : Ok, great… won’t be long.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I know this guy wasn't a newbie or anything, so I wasn't going to bend over backwards for him. Most people know now that a scion will kill a person, and this one wasn't and FDing, Mezzing class.<br />
<br />
Most times when I get a &quot;Hello&quot; I just don't respond, but I was in a very good mood after recieving news about my new job, and when I am in a really really good mood I tend to mess around a bit. My tents groups usually know that when we take off all our weapons and I switch to &quot;Healing&quot; so we can go back to what it was like before Uber was a word.<br />
<br />
Again, isn't a rant, but at least once a month I tend to meet someone that will have me and my boyfriend rolling around laughing, and it's always nice to share. I am sure this is very similar to alot of other stories out there.<br />
<br />
