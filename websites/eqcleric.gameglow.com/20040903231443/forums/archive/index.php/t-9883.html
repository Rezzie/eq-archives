<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toddlar</div><div class="date">08-13-2000, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh, I write this post after just bearly leaving my KC cursed hand room group.  2 times the party died and I think it was fault.  I'll speak of the first incident now.<br />
<br />
1st incident.<br />
We had a 56 warrior pulling bodyguards from a little ways away from hand room(BG's conned yellow @ 50).  He had full cleric buffs,(not naltron but pinzarn) and i started to CH him @ around 2.5h and it went off 1/18 a second too late.  Our warrior was dead and we had 3 angrys to deal with.  people who could gated and a few people died in the group of 6.<br />
<br />
2nd incident<br />
When our druid pulled 3 mobs.  I have a litle B&amp;W Tv by my computer and I glanced over @ it while he was INC.  When i glanced back @ the health bars he was 1h, doh!  I started casting sup healing but, he was toast before it went off.<br />
<br />
/sigh, i've always considered myself a good cleric but, these incidents that killed most of my party makes me think otherwise.  =(<br />

<br />
but hay your 50 you got a good res that always help the bad days become not so bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SeaOfHoles</div><div class="date">08-14-2000, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All secondary healers need to know it is their job to apply light heals as necessary when the the Complete Heal is resolving.  Tossing a CH at 2.5(rather than 1.5 or 2.0) with 3 MOBS on him sounds like pretty good plan to me.  If the Druid didn't know enough to heal, you need to explain it to them.<br />
<br />
Yea.  On some pulls, I am afraid to even start rearranging spells, because a player's health can take some very suprising turns for the worse VERY quickly.<br />
<br />
Besides, although death is unpleasant, it is not nearly the trouble it once was.  We have 90% ressurections afterall.  I have died 5 times in level 51 already.  All in Karnor's.  ON the first pull in a new group, a Monk feigned death right in the MIDDLE of the group.  I was sitting.  I was dead in 1.5 secs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenae</div><div class="date">08-17-2000, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the things I have started doing on CH's is running a countdown.  System goes like this:<br />
<br />
1.  Sitting and medding, watching health bars.  See that the tank is approaching what I consider to be CH'ing time.  This is normally 40%, but will vary up and down depending on how much damage they are taking.<br />
<br />
2.  Stand up, begin casting CH.<br />
<br />
3.  Announce &quot;CH'ing target X&quot;, at this point there are normally about 7.5 or 8 secs to go on the casting time.<br />
<br />
4.  At the halfway point type &quot;5&quot;, meaning 5 secs to go.<br />
<br />
5.  Type &quot;2&quot; when 2 secs to go.<br />
<br />
6.  Spell goes off.<br />
<br />
<br />
This system has several effects.  First off it lets the tank and any secondary healers know the heal is coming, and WHEN.  This branches into the following:<br />
<br />
1.  If the tank thinks they are going to die, they can back off and let someone else occupy it's attention for 2 secs.<br />
<br />
2.  If the secondary healer thinks they are going to die, they can slip in a GH to keep them healthy.<br />
<br />
3.  Everyone in the group knows I am occupied for 10 seconds and unable to perform further heals.<br />
<br />
4.  If the tank and secondary healers thinks everything's going great, they get a warm fuzzy feeling knowing that I am looking out for them.  Obviously this is the one I like most!<br />

We all have them. I remember one day when i was with my regular group I managed to let the same ranger die 3 times, cos I didnt judge for allowing more mobs to enter the fight when I cast CH. Don't worry everybody has their off days. Also try not to feel bad when someone dies (preaching to myself too here), unfortunatly when a cleric makes a mistake its all too obvious, with other classes it can be much harder to spot the mistake, for example, a broken mez etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however let me point out, warriors should not pull in Karnors and druids goes down almost as fast as a chanter.<br />
<br />
<br />
you wanna be successful in karnor, get a ranger in your group, not even a monk can outpull a ranger in this zone.  I speak from experience.<br />

Bad cleric? Nah, some areas are just real tough and these things happen. Res 'em back up and they're good as new. Now if you let your enchanter die you might be a bad cleric :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use Complete Heal lots. LOTS.<br />
<br />
My groups are familiar with my tactics and my countdowns. For normal CH I announce '6 sec' at the 6 second mark. This lets the secondary healers toss a GH if needed or cover any other rapidly developing problem.<br />
<br />
If the target is a ranger I will announce '3 sec' giving him time to Jolt if needed. I usually call for Jolt prior to 3 seconds if I see the HP curve won't make it.<br />
<br />
Other tanks get a '2 sec' call at the last bubble of the cast time. That cues them to decide if they need to back off.<br />
<br />
When a battle is close I do a '8 6 4 2' countdown, mostly to let them know I am a bit worried. If more than one person is getting a CH I name them prior to count, as in (Tanarel the Ranger and Icebeast the Warrior):<br />
<br />
'Tan 8 sec', '6', 'Jolt', '3'<br />
'Ice 8 sec', '2 sec'<br />
