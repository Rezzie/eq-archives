They typically have a sorta slow respawn (10 or so mins but I haven't put a timer to it), but if you can't find anything better to do they're good exp. They vary in level, but the ones that I know of that are in this range are:<br />
<br />
Tacar Tissleplay, lvl 25-ish, in Felwithe. He's right next to the weapons shop and bank, turn right when you get to the pally guild and follow that one around.<br />
Silna Song(something), lvl 25-ish, in Hobbithell..uh, I mean Rivervale. She's hidden, sorta. When coming in from MT, turn left and go around by the inn there, turn right and there she is, just waiting for some lovin'.<br />
I think the bard in Highkeep Hold is also a potential victim at this level...have not visited him yet though.<br />
The bard in Erudin (Tacar &lt;something&gt;). Cons even to my 25.<br />
<br />
Fac hits that I know of are: (I think there are a couple of others) You can reverse these hits (somewhat) by killing off the inhabitants of Mistmoore.<br />
- for League of Antonican Bards (duh)<br />
- for Guards of Qeynos<br />
+ for Mahjongg(sic) Mistmoore<br />
<br />
Loot: I've gotten as much as a plat and scattering of silver, to a gold and some copper off Silna. That's about all.<br />
<br />
Observed exp: From my 25 half-elven rogue, about 1/5 to 1/4 bar per kill on Silna.<br />
