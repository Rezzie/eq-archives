</FONT><HR>This will be a very long topic, but it's for those who haven't started and wish to find out what is said and done.  I will break up the text with messages of what happens at that point or what you should do...<P>Anyway, the quest starts with Schmendrick himself in Lake Rathe.<P>You say, 'hail Shmendrik Lavawalker'<BR>Shmendrik Lavawalker says 'Hail, good Ebina !! Be wary near the waters of Lake Rathe! The Riptide goblin king, Lord Bergurgle has been commanding his minions to murder and rob all who come near it! I am here seeking his death but I am afraid I am no match for all of his subjects. I shall reward you greatly for the death of Lord Bergurgle.  I simply ask 	that you bring me his crown as proof.<P>Kill Lord Bergurgle at the goblin tower underwater.  28 minute spawn in the middle.  Retrieve the crown and hand it over to Schmendrick.<P>Shmendrik Lavawalker shoves the crown into a scorch marked leather satchel and cackles uncontrollably as madness twists his features and flames dance in his eyes. You Ebina have reduced the Riptides into chaos! Without a king to keep them in control they will ravage the settlements surrounding this lake! After the slaughter I shall return and easily burn the remainder of the villages and fishing shanties to the ground! None shall escape the fires of the Tyrant!!<P>Natasha spawns and you receive the Oil of Fennin Ro.<P>Natasha Whitewater shouts 'The Triumvirate of Water has decreed your fate, Schmendrick Lavawalker!! I am here to deliver said fate!! <BR>Shmendrik Lavawalker says 'I'll slay you like I slaughtered your fellow missionaries! The Triumvirate can not decide the fate of a follower of the Tyrant!!<BR>Natasha Whitewater says 'Enough!! Your existence has come to an end!<BR>Shmendrik Lavawalker is overcome with madness and rage Shmendrik Lavawalker begins to cast a spell.<BR>Natasha Whitewater says 'This conflict has been destined by the waters of the Triumvirate!<P>Kicks his butt, at this point, get in close and kill the Spirit of Flame for the Damaged Crown. Once it's dead...<P>Natasha Whitewater says 'The Riptide goblins must have their crown returned to them. If you would be so kind as to give me the crown I will make sure that it reaches them. Hopefully they are capable enough to repair the damage that has been done to it.<P>Give her the Damaged Crown.  You get a Ornate Sea Shell.<P>Natasha Whitewater says 'I will have this crown returned to the Riptide Goblins immediately! Should you ever come across an Erudite name Omat Vastsea give him this sea shell. The waters of Norrath shimmer with awareness of your deeds here today!<P>Take the Sea Shell to Omat Vastdeep at the hidden inn in Timorous Deep.  Long swim, rare if oyu get attacked on the way.<P>You say, 'hail Omat Vastsea'<BR>Omat Vastsea bows deeply. 'I have been expecting you, Ebina.  The waters have foretold your arrival. I am High Priest Omat Vastsea of the Triumvirate missionaries.  Please feel free to enjoy the quiet solitude of this inn.' <BR>You say, 'who triumvirate'<BR>Omat Vastsea says 'The Triumvirate of Water are: E'ci, the mistress of ice; Tarew Marr, the lord of water; and Povar, the formless master of vapor and mist. We Triumvirate missionaries are granted great divinatory powers and wisdom through our devotion to the Triumvirate and must defend the waters of Norrath from the ravages of the Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro. <BR>You say, 'who is fennin ro'<BR>Omat Vastsea says 'The Tyrant of Fire, Fennin Ro, is the merciless lord of fire in all its forms. The rivalry between the tyrant and the Triumvirate is as old as the gods themselves and is an eternal battle. We witness the struggle every moment of our lives as the Oasis of Marr succumbs to the heat of the surrounding desert and is replenished by the swelling of the Lifire River. That fragile balance between the elements must be maintained but the Plasmatic Priesthood threatens that balance. <BR>You say, 'what plasmatic priesthood'<BR>Omat Vastsea says 'The Plasmatic Priesthood are worshipers of the Tyrant of Fire, but they have been driven mad by their fanaticism and have forgotten the importance of the balance. In their madness they would set the whole world aflame, leaving nothing but lifeless ash.<P>Turn in the Sea Shell.<P>Omat Vastsea says 'So, you are a friend of Natasha's? That is good to see. She is a very wise and gifted woman. The Riptide goblins have adopted a new king but are still in a vulnerable state until his subjects accept his rule. The Plasmatic Priesthood is aware of the weakened state of the Riptides and has convinced the Fire Peak goblins to strike against them. Although I do not agree with the mannerisms or actions of any goblin clan, such a war would be detrimental to all who are caught in its path. Lord Gimblox of the Fire Peak clan has been meeting with a member of the Plasmatic Priesthood in the Temple of Solusek Ro. Locate the Plasmatic Priest, hand him this statue to hinder his powers, then eliminate him and bring me his robe.<P>You receive a Coral Statue of Tarew, as in Tarew Marr.  Head to Temple of Solusek Ro in Lavastorm.  Seek out a male seeker that spawns at 9 am.  Spawns in the room of 3 Temple people, left side.  He pops really quick after he was killed.  We only had to wait no more than 10 minutes to kill him again.  Hand him the statue and prepare for a fight, only need a one good group.  I had 5 people, 2 clerics (me (51) and friend (60) doing quest), 45 SK, 53 warrior, 60 bard.  Was not hard.<P>You say, 'plasmatic priest'<BR>a seeker says 'You speak of things that should not be spoken! It would be in your best interest to leave this temple at once and return to lands less consumed by flame!<P>Give him the Statue.<P>a seeker shakes violently as his hand closes on the coral statue and flames dance in the depths of his eyes! The statue begins to emit a reddish glow then shatters in a burst of a fire and smoke! The flames in the plasmatic priest's eyes vanish with the explosion and only madness remains!  'The Triumvirate thinks that destroying my spirit of flame will stop me?!!  I will kill you all now, the goblins will continue to war, and when my spirit is restored I will ensure that Ixiblat Fer consumes all of Norrath in his flames!!' <P>You receieve a DarkWood Staff (useless) and a Blood-Stained Priest Robe, which is droppable strangely enough.  Head over to Soldung A and kill Lord Gimblox which spawns on the right side of the Throne Room.  It's the other door near the King's door.  19 minute spawn, but easier to get than Lord Bergurgle.  head back to Omat and turn in ONLY the robe.<P>Omat Vastsea says 'You have proven yourself to be one who is willing to take responsibility for his own actions. Such a trait is desired by all deities to be present in their faithful. I pray that you had the wisdom to slay Lord Gimblox as well as the Plasmatic Priest in order to prevent further advancement of the incursion against the Riptides. Priestess Natasha awaits inside the inn for Lord Gimblox's ring, make haste for she is a busy woman and will soon depart. <P>You recieve a Orb of Frozen Water, which so far is useless, but maybe useful for making Ixiblat Fer easier perhaps?  Head inside the inn and give Natasha the ring from Lord Gimblox.<P>Natasha Whitewater says 'Thank you, Ebina , for your services thus far. The Triumvirate missionaries are, so far, impressed. However, there is yet another threat rising from the Plasmatic Priesthood that may have dire effects on all of Norrath if it is not stopped.  An Iksar member of the Triumvirate missionaries has discovered that the Plasmatic Priesthood has somehow convinced the sarnak summoners of Chardok to assist them in summoning Ixiblat Fer to Norrath. Take this shell to Naxot Deepwater in the Burning Woods so that she knows I have sent you. We ask that you return with the Sceptre of Ixiblat Fer as well as evidence to show that the Plasmatic Priesthood is dealing with the sarnaks. High Priest Omat will await your return. I must depart for now.  I pray for your success. <P>You recieve a second Ornate Sea Shell (probably not the same, need a identify cast on them) and head to Burning Woods.  Beware, at this point you need a seriously strong dragon ready type party.  Many of them.  Details and ways are listed elsewhere on how to handle Ixiblat.  Find Naxot Deepwater.<P>You say, 'hail Naxot Deepwater'<BR>Naxot Deepwater says 'Beware these woods! The sarnaks claim this land as their own and wicked 	creatures walk beneath the burning foliage. <P>Give him the shell.  After this I don't have a log myself.  Haven't given it and haven't tried yet.  Needing to get my Guild together and possibly several others.  Hope this helps those just joining in on the quest.  I'll make a second part to this from handing in the shell to Naxot and beyond.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
