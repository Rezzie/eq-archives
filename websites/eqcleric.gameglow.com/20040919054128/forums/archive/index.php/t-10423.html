But I am heading over to Unrest or Befallen now. The loot here is decent you will pull about a plat to 3 plat with only one bag. You can get alot of good items here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frobozz</div><div class="date">09-28-2000, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crushbone is famous for it's various cool items like the screaming mace, shiny brass shield, and the dragoon dirk.  Thus, it's also commonly crowded.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, there is experience and loot to be made here.  An appropriately armored cleric can solo the various centurion spawns all over the zone.  The best bet, however, is to join a group and take on the BIGGER centurions and slavers.  As you get higher in levels, you can then take legionnaires outside the castle...and eventually, the Throne Room...<br />
<br />
Remember, you're a cleric.  Groups will want you here since the lego's hit pretty darn hard...</div></div><hr />
