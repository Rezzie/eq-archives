</FONT><HR>Well, maybe not "bad" but I really need to improve in lots of areas.  Right now I feel that I am ill-suited to play in dungeon zones.<P>First, let me start with a little background.  At level 27, I started grouping with an equal level warrior in the Lake of Ill Omen.  We partnered up and rolled up to 30 together.  We both were on EQ about the same hours of the day so it was easy to keep partnering up.  Velious had recently come out so we packed up and moved to Ice Clad.<P>We both fell in love with the exp from the ice cougars and got 36th from fighting them and the other mobs in Ice Clad.  It was also very profitable since we got over a dozen earrings which at that time sold for around 1kpp each.  From Ice Clad we went to Overthere, then to the Rathe Mountains and finally we both hit 49th level in the Dreadlands.<P>As you see we have fought exclusively in outdoor zones with no exposure to dungeon zones.  As of right now I am 50th and trying to get some exposure to dungeon life.<P>Here are the areas I need advice on.  I'll tell you what I tend to do in each section.  Any ideas on doing the job better would be great.<P>1)  Buffs.  Right now I'm Resoing all tanks.  Hitting the rest with Valor from my Donal arms.  SoWording and Symboling puller and main tank.  Sometimes SoWording other tanks if damage is being spread out.<P>2)  Heals.  I have Sup, Cel and Com Heal memmed.  I use Cel Heal most.  With Com Heal reserved for tanks over 2.5k hps.  I use Sup as an emergency heal.<P>3)  Defense.  I have both Auras memmed and seem to use them alot.  After heals and such.  I try to wait to heal for aggro to build up but often times they still jump on me.  I also keep root memmed for root parking.<P>4)  Offense.  Holy might is the only offense spell I keep memmed all the time.  When partnering I sometimes loaded up a boom spell if I was sitting at FM alot.  I've not had an occasion to load it in a dungeon yet.<P>5)  Judgement.  I'm sure this category is hard to give advise on but ...  I seem to have a hard time choosing who to heal with what heal spell.  When partnered I exclusively used ComHeal.  In a dungeon, I've not had alot of success with ComHeal and deaths have resulted.  I've fallen back to CelHeal but the efficency of not being able to use ComHeal seems to be hurting my mana pool and I'm LOM or OOM a lot.  I seem to do alright when the pull is easy but when I need to make a split second decision I'm getting people killed.  Do I just need more exposure to this type of play to build up an "instinct" on what to do?<P>6)  Groups.  How can I tell when I'm in a bad group or if am I making a potentially good group bad?  I'm been spoiled by playing with the same person for 20+ levels.  We got to know each others styles and directions very well.  Even to the point where a lot directions and communication wasn't needed and was taken for granted.  I've thrown myself into a dungeon group situation and I'm lost on what to communicate to the group.  I try to keep them informed of my mana and the number of heals I potentially have left.  I also tell them when something is beating on me.  Beyond that I'm clueless.<P>7)  Honing Dungeon skills.  What are some good dungeons to "practice" in?  I'm in Karnor's Castle right now but I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm in way over my head.<P>If you have read this far "thank you".  I would really appreciate any suggestions.  <P>Thank Ye<BR>Izz</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>1)  A lot of this will change when you get ot 52 and get group Heroism.  But sounds like you are doing buffs as most of us have/are doing.<P>2)  Again - at 51 you get remedy - you will probably use that a lot.  It's an upgraded greater heal - fast casting - long range and heals between greater heal and superior heal.<P>3)  Sounds good.<P>4)  Sounds about right.<P>5)  If you are in a dungeon with multiple tanks, try to have them let only the primary tank and possibly the 2nd tank do the taunts.  That way you keep damage focused on 1 or 2 people.  You also need to be watching as to what you are fighting and how fast they are damaging the tanks.<P>Typically you heal a well buff tank around 2 bubbles.  The situation dictates how far you push that amount up or down.<P>6)  That's about all you can do.<P>7)  Karnors isn't a dungeon.  Its the mid point for several train stations.  There are other places that would be much better for you to try to deal with "dungeon" experience.<P>Find a couple groups of friends and try the hole.  It is a good dungeon with a great XP bonus.  A few pretty nice drops in there as well.  Guk and Sol B are both considered dungeon type zones.<P>Definitely get used to the atmosphere before going back to Karnors.  Even experienced people will/can have troubles with Karnors.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I don't believe you are "way over your head" as you say in KC.  You just haven't had the experience you need (as again you've said).<P>Just give it some time and watch the situations as they develop.  Celestial heal is a great spell but can run you oom in no time if you use it exclusively.  Complete heal should be used on your tanks provided your support people are doing what they need to be doing (ie Shaman slows, enchanter mezzes, warriors taunt).  Superior or greater-heal or remedy should be used for all casters if they get aggro'd.  <P>You state that you have root memmed.  Well when the enchanter in the group gets aggro I turn and either stun or root to grab the mobs attention or to stop it.  Either way the enchanter is safe for a time.  <P>So don't be too hard on yourself and give it some time as your skills will increase and your performace will improve.<P><P>------------------<BR>Greywolffe Silverstarr<BR>52nd Cleric of Tunare<BR>E'Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have to disagree with greywolfe in this. Complete heal is a quick way to get yourself killed, unless the chanter is on top of the extra mobs. Soon as you use Complete heal, I can guarantee that every unegaged mob on your group will now be on you.  <P>Celestial heal has a much smaller agro then complete heal.  Most times if I do Celestial heal I can keep the group in full health and full mana.  If a good chanter is with your group, you can risk the Complete heal if he or she is paying attention and instantly mezzes it.  Other wise expect to die alot using Complete heal.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>If there are multiple mobs I cel heal early on the main tank, heading off the inevitable damage. I try to time it so that they stay above three bubs of health. I save Com heal for the last mob, I target the mob and when at 1/3 life i cast the com heal on the main tank, this allows me to med for the longest period before the next pull and I rarely get aggroed. Of course this is all dependent on a good group with everyone doing there job. <BR>KC is rough, so are the other dung, but they are somewhat more forgiving.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Go to Lower Guk and camp the Ghoul Lord and Froglok King. Go to Sol B and do the Stone Spider room. Experience is the only thing that will make you better - gradually work your way up to harder areas.<P>Once you've played out guk and sol b, skip KC entirely and head to Chardok. There, you'll get some good exposure to high-intensity situations with relatively little risk if you camp the zone out. It's a good place to practice stunning gaters, an important skill for the top dungeons. Once you feel confident you can handle that, it's time to try some of the camps in Sebilis, or some of the easier parts of the Hole.<P>A note about KC: I don't know what it is about this dungeon exactly - maybe it's the moat/zone camps - but people who learn the ropes in KC invariably come out scarred and dysfunctional. KC is in many many ways the exception rather than the rule. It almost seems designed to get people into bad habits - when we see people not assisting, breaking mezzes, etc. we call it KC syndrome. Also the fact that it's the only in-zone pickup dungeon for 50+ means that you'll encounter way too many people who have little idea how to play in groups.<P>Ok onto the list point by point:<P>1) Buffs: Hit everyone with Reso. When you factor in cast time = not medding time, Donal's arms don't save you anything at all. That line is so wildly efficient you're only hurting yourself by not using the best all the time. Symbols on self, enchanter, and tanks - if you can save yourself money and have just one person do most of the tanking that's great. I find though if you are with 2 tanks they try and prove themselves and you really have to maintain both. AC buffs - well it's my humble opinion that you can leave these out entirely unless you have nothing else to do with your mana, but others might differ. Might be worth it on a single tank. Use the Armor of Protection spell from velious, it's also great efficiency and lasts forever.<P>2) Heals: You need a fast heal, a solid direct heal, and complete. Fast heals are almost exclusively for enchanters, or if you've fallen asleep and wake up with someone at a quarter bubble. I'd use GH as the fast heal if I were you... but get just one more level and Remedy does both these jobs for you for a while. Celestial and superior are redundant, they both perform the middle-heal function. I'd take the one you use more and make it your middle heal; celestial I think will be better. Complete is what in my opinion separates good clerics from great ones. Great clerics get the most out of complete heal. A lot of that is learning when you have the freedom to cast it without anyone else dying. You'll have to learn this by experience, the only advice I can really give on this is make sure your enchanter can survive while you are casting it.<P>3) Defense - using divines is a good sign. As you move into harder areas I recommend replacing root with atone in your regular lineup - summonners make root parking quite frustrating. Some will disagree here, it's a matter of style. I find enchanters prefer when I atone and it saves me mana healing them - and since I depend on enchanters for viability I cater to their needs first and foremost.<P>4) Offense: Get used to a 2 stun lineup, you'll need them to stop gaters. Level 5 Stun doesn't break mezzes and is less resisted than any other stun, something that will prove immensely valuable to you - it should be your first stun. I load up HM as the second stun because of low recycle time - until you get Reckoning at 54 you might want to play with Sound of Force since it is efficient as both a stun and a DD relative to other tools at your disposal. 54+ you can use Reckoning to blow off extra mana and speed up kills. For the most part though, clerics are defense and our role is being an enabler for others who deal the damage. Think support class, that's what we are.<P>5)Judgement: Communicate. Do your best to keep people alive. If you do something once and it doesn't work try something else. Nothing but experience and an open mind will help you on this one.<P>6)Groups: See five. Also good thing to do in groups is inform people of adds if you see them first. Make a plan for how you will kill mobs and practice on the first few that come your way. Every group will play a bit different - don't be afraid to ask people to adjust what they are doing to make things go more smoothly.<P>7) XP dungeons at 50 from easiest to hardest: Guk, Sol B, Kedge Keep, Hole, Chardok, Sebilis. Notice the absence of KC from this list. For your own mental health keep it that way. Get used to spending the first 30-60 min of every session arranging a good group and getting to your dungeon. It's the price you pay for avoiding the horrors of KC, and well worth it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>For large pulls an early Complete Heal = someone dead (usually enchanter).  I use Remedy to keep everyone alive until all the mobs except the main target are mezzed.  Then I switch to Complete Heal when things are under control.  I also try to keep the puller topped off in dungeons, whereas outside you can let someone pull with 50% health if you want.<P>The main thing is to keep the enchanter alive at all costs.  Symbolling the enchanter is a must.  Remember the mobs in KC hit quite a bit harder than the mobs in DL, so the enchanters can really drop fast.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think everyone has pretty much summed up my thoughts as well.  You have the right ideas, now just learn from your mistakes and grow from them.  You didn't list all of the tactics that you use while fighting, so I'm going to toss out some things that I do.  If you already use them, then feel free to ignore, and if you don't use them, then take the advise as you'd like:<P>* Stuns.  I know someone else mentioned this one, but I wanted to reiterate how useful they are.  If you are fighting a caster, learn to stun just as they are casting, and learn the timing of their spells.  You can save a lot of mana and lots of problems if you get this skill down.<P>* Hotkeys.  Set up hotkeys for your heals, and add a message letting your group know what heal is coming, and for who.  For example, something like:<P>/sit off<BR>/cast 4<BR>/g One complete heal coming up for %T!<P>This is just a way to improve communication with your group.<P>* Heals.  You will always find yourself picking the wrong heal.  At least I do  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  As soon as I cast a heal, I often start thinking, "Why didn't I cast x instead?"  Or "Why didn't I cast it on x instead?"  With heals, live (or die, heh) and learn, it's the only way you'll find what works best for you.  My tactics are similar to yours, using cel heal when feasible, complete heal on tanks when I will have time to get it off safely, and superior heal when the time factors on the other two are too long.<P>* But you will make mistakes, no matter how much experience you have.  The other important factor is how well you recover from those mistakes.  Don't let them bother you, or throw you in to a panic.  A group with a calm cleric is a group that has a MUCH better chance of survival  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Keep your cool, and let your group see you as a confident cleric, even if you feel as though you are still learning.  If someone in your group dies, don't worry about what you might have done wrong to have caused their death.  Rather, immediately focus on what you need to do to keep everyone else alive.<P>Remember, there are up to five other people in your group that are making just as many mistakes as you are!  Each person has a responsibility, and the success of the group depends on them just as much as it depends on you.  <P>* You know how to play very well with that one person ... take the knowledge you've gained there, and apply it to the people you meet.  I think after the first or maybe second fight of the group, you should be able to tell the style of each member in the group, and learn to adapt your technique appropriately.  What works in one situation does not work in all, and what works in one group does not work in all.  <P>* Don't be afraid to try something new in order to succeed.  I was fighting with a group of people at the giant fort in Great Divide, I think it was all tanks, and two or three of the people were a good 8 levels below me, heh.  We had a nasty pull with four giants.  As soon as I saw them coming, I knew root-parking wasn't going to cut it, because it wouldn't be reliable or fast enough.  So I quick flipped through my spellbook and pulled out flash of light  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  So long as a mob isn't engaged, it causes the mob to run as if hit with fear.  I kept three giants occupied using just flash of light, while they took down the fourth.  Let them grab the next one, and repeat.  Cost me almost no mana, and with celestial healing, everyone was okay while I was busy "flashing."  In that situation, we would've been dead had I not tried something, so why not experiment and see if you can't find something that works!<P>Just some suggestions.  Best of luck to you  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Thalanar Solal<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Brell Serilis Server<BR>Leader of Shadow<BR>http://www.silver-shadows.com/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Dude, get outta KC. I did my dungeon learning in SOlB pre-kunark, and spend a lot of time in Sebilis now. I avoid KC like the plague, because it's a death trap waiting to happen. Why? Three reasons: Sow, Zone line, named mobs. <P>The first reaction of a good dungeon group (not counting LZO and UZO in seb) should be evac if you have to much to handle...not zone. with Sow and that handy double zone line in KC everyone will hotfoot to the zone, creating spectacular trains. Named mobs are in every zone, but when combined with the ability to use SoW and a close zone line........lets just say that it brings out the worst in a lot of folks. <P><BR>Your best bet to learn dungeon fighting would be Solb, Guk, or the first part of Chardok / Sebilis, where CR is fairly easier. You can pop into KC for a while now and then, just to remind yourself how bad it is. Whomever coined the phrase Karnage Castle had it right.<P><BR>Edit: anyone else get the feeling KC is just mistmoore with better pathing?<P>------------------<BR>The patchwork cleric<BR>Domus Divinae<BR>Prexus<p>[This message has been edited by Gniss Fleshmender (edited 04-16-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>A few notes:<P>1-I agree, for the most part, KC is an easy zone to handle.  Sometimes I prefer hunting here, not only because it's not too stressful, but because if I need to leave suddenly, it's an easy escape.<P>2-However, with KC being such an easy zone, I think it would be a good place to learn in.  Getting your buff cycles up, stunning gating and healing mobs, and practicing your heal tactics.  Since the hunting spots near the zone are pretty simple, if you do make a mistake it won't hurt as bad as in OS or someplace like that.  You can practice timing your CHeals, or seeing if it is better to use Celestial Healing, etc.<P>3-The best way I have found to keep up with buffs if start myself as the first, then buff down the line.  Always do group hero so that's easy.  Lately I had been giving everyone SoW, with myself as the first.  When it started fading, I would restart SoWing everyone again.  Symbol is a little bit different, normally I just put Marzin on the main tank and then whoever else needs it, and ask the tank to let me know when it fades.<P>So basically you just need to refine your skills a little bit.  I still get scared using CHeal.  Not only that I may mistime it and the tank may die, but maybe because during the 10sec cast time someone else gets aggroed and needs a heal.  Best thing I can tell you though, is to don't worry so much about mana.  May sound dumb, but I've had someone die on me before because I was trying to conserve mana rather than just HEAL.  Rarely do I run out of mana anyway, so personally, I need to worry more about keeping people alive than conserving so much mana.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Others have done a great job, explaining things, I'll just reinforce or stress a thing or two.<P>1)Buffs sounds good, You should always give everyone your best hp buff, in your case reso. At 52 when you get group hero, this gets easy. AC buffs, they are nice but the casting cost is so high they are optional, and the upgrades tend to be just a little better for a lot more mana, so you may want to look into only AC buffing the main tank and maybe yourself, maybe going without, or maybe even using a less expensive AC buff if mana is tight.<P>Symbols, everyone doesnt do it the exact same way, I will usually give myself, every tank expected to tank damage, and the chanter my best symbol. I give everyone else a "lesser" symbol (pinzarn), its cheap and low mana. For symbols, *MAKE SURE* you are getting reimbursed for them! If your in a dungeon that doesnt need many symbols, maybe scale back for dungeons like sebilis drop a ton of cash, so in seb groups I feel free to use lots of symbols, because I know the group will hand over the money at the end when I tell them how much I spent on symbols ; ) Nothing will make a cleric poor faster than letting a group get away with freebie peridot-cost symbols all night.<P>2) I usually keep 4 heals memmed now at 56, but at your level I used 3. Basically, you need something small and quick, you need a large heal thats less than CH, and you need CH.<P>CH is going to take you time, the best clerics are seperated by their ability to use CH well without getting people killed. CH is very situational. Are you in a group where 3-4 pulls are common? Is your messer seeming to have difficulty getting it all under control quickly? You use CH only when things are more or less under control and low-stress.<P>Also, cel heal rocks in my opinion, its a wonderful heal, but dont rely too much on this wonderful spell! Just like CH, sometimes you may get people killed by unthinkingly relying on it too much. If you have a caster or rogue or something down to 60%, not getting hit amnymore, tank has it taunted, good I'd use celheal. If your necro is getting assaulted, and you celheal him when hes down to 30%, your going to feel really stupid in about 8 seconds.<P>When the enchanter is getting hit deep in a dungeon, as long as you got someone else who can halfway tank, no one else matters. The enchanter's life is about as important as yours, and this is where you sometimes make tough choices. If your enchanter is 50%, and going down fast needing a heal right now, and your rogue is down to 5%, your just gonna have to let the rogue go. (depending on situation of course, lets just assume something like a 3-frog mess in seb)If he is worth a darn, he'll understand why you couldnt heal him after you explain later. This is rare though, usually I can find some way of saving everyone, but for the worst situations, sometimes you have 2 seconds to realize that no, someone is gonna die, so who do you save for the group's best chance. This is advanced stuff though, you wont have to deal with for a while.<P>3) Wonderful, a good sign, I've already preached the virtues of having both invulns up.<P>4) sounds good, though I rarely mem a nuke now, I go with the 2 cheapo stuns. stuns = very little mana = a few seconds worth of the critter not hurting anyone = little less need to heal. Just watch your own aggro, chain-stunning ticks them off. For stunning you arent concerned with damage, you just want that stupid critter stunned, especially casters, and these will go through unresisted most often, plus the level 5 stun wont break mess when your stunning something while the chanter is trying to mes.<P>5) You just need time, you seem to be kinda like a young pitcher in baseball. ; ) Some days your just going to do everything wrong and lose by a hundred runs, you just gotta learn what you did wrong, and then forget about it.<P>7) In order of progression, when you have "mastered" or "outclassed", one go to the next: Lower Guk -> Solb -> hmmm, kedge or the hole, tower of Frozen Shadow might also be nice -> Chardok. I love this zone, because it can be so deceptively easy at times. One moment you think you know everything, and then this dungeon just comes out and humbles you. : ) If it seems easy after what youve done so far, dont take it for granted or fall asleep, this place can kill you very quickly. In chardok you will either learn the joys of stunning, or youll come out bruised and broken. -> Finally, Sebilis. I'd recommend waiting till 52 or so and knowing your class very well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Thought I'd add my two cents since I have been fighting in KC.<P>First off your only major problem seems to be the timing of ComHeals.  This just takes practice, but I'd go practice somewhere safer like SolB or even guk if one of the farmers will let you in a group.  Almost no single mob in Lguk will outdamage CelHeal in my experience so it is a good place to get comfortable with working in a group.<P>Second, by the ammount you seem to be getting agroed, I'm guessing you don't have a chanter to much.  I found this to be a major problem in most of KC (DT and LT being the exception)<P>Third, if you are hunting in KC, chances are you group sucks as a whole.  I have finally given up on this zone, better drops then I can get anywhere else at my lvl or not.  The last 4 groups I had in there managed to get me killed inside 15 minutes.  Out of the few weeks I was there, I probably only had two really good groups (thank you Arirang) and 2 or 3 other decent groups.  I mean, some of these guys pull from trains and expect the bard to mez it all, expect me to keep up with heals and root park everything and then train as soon I die because of the horrendous amounts of agro I've generated.  The only time I have found KC to be good is off peak hours.  I get the feeling that a lot of the people in there come from the same hunting background as you.. i.e. never been in a dungeon.  While not neccesarily a bad thing, unlike you, many of them never want to listen to anyone else's advice and do not learn from their mistakes.  I just can't fathom how everything camp can have a full group, plus 2 or 3 groups at the zone pulling and there still be trains.  I've seen it so crowded that I've run from DT to LT to hand without seeing a mob, yet sure enough, there is a train to zone a few minutes later.  It is like being in unrest all over again <shivers at the horrid memories>.<P>As you can see, I feel a bit passionate about KC.  I will probably never go back there in a pick up group, I generally only seem to lose exp.  I realize others have already driven this point home, but I couldn't resist jumping in.<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>46th lvl cleric of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Flames of Faradhim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>First off, let me say this - you've done yourself an injustice by sticking to outdoor zones. Dungeons are lots of fun and build valuable skills. But it's easy to let happen and you can recover, and in asking these kinds of questions are off to a good start.<P>1. Buffs - two things I see. First is that, IMHO, Shield of words is a big fat waste of mana. Armor of faith uses half the mana for 6 less ac if I remember the discussion correctly.  The only time I break out SoW is if I want the extra duration (I'm buffing a newbie and sending them off)  Second, you didn't mention the ENCHANTER.  High end groups have two key components - the enchanter and the cleric.  Either one dies, and you're in deep trouble. You should keep full buffs on the enchanter as you would on the main tank.  (As a side note, the reso/valor thing becomes moot when you get heroic bond, a great spell.)<P>2. Heals - remedy is an awesome spell you'll have soon. I like the fast cast and long range particularly.  I will keep from 2 to 4 heals mem'd depending on things. Celestial is always one  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> <P>3. Sounds good<P>4. Sounds good<P>5. Complete heal is great in very tightly controlled situations. In a dungeon it's not uncommon to have to split your attention between the enchanter, yourself, the main tank, maybe someone else.  Complete heal gets tricky in those circumstances. Being pro-active with celestial can make this easier, and use of things like remedy and divine light when you get it are also good. I find myself using complete heal a LOT less than I used to, and only when the situation is well in hand, and I need high mana efficiency.<P>6. Mostly, you'll know it when you see it. But there are signs like good agro management, communication, etc. that will be indicators.<P>7. Karnors. Personal opinion time - Karnors is a dump.  I don't care for it at all.  Sebilis is a great place once you get your key but it will really push your skills to the limit. Similar with Howling Stones I hear.  Those places might be a little rough to work your skills, so I'd suggest some old world dungeons like Sol A or lower guk.<P>Also, tower of frozen shadow is a fun place if you have plenty of keys.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I would try Lower Guk or Sol B for dungeon experience.<BR>KC is can be a real pain, as the trains there are really nasty, and quite a few (at least on BB) dont call trains and take them to diffrent sides of the zone-in :/<P>Our meager L5 stun is one of the best spells to assist your enchanter, as I wont breake mez, and can be used to assist the enc mezzing a mob beating on him.<P>Also: Keep your enchanter alive at all costs. If my enc takes dam, he gets a heal the moment I see his bar dropping (call me paraniod, but it keeps him alive). Cel Heal can be good at this  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>But most of all, have fun!<BR>And if your party gets killed (it will happen), learn from your mistakes, sometimes it can be due to some strange aggro/pathing bugs - take a trip to Kedge, and you will know what I mean.

</FONT><HR> <BR>Buffs - The calling card of a great cleric is mana conservation.   Cleric downtime means party downtime, so you must learn to do all your jobs (stunner, healer, buffer) and still be ready to continue with the next pull.  As suggested earlier, everyone needs Reso, but you can use Valor as a stop gap until you have the spare mana to replace it with Reso. Try to spread these buffs out and tell your party members to notify you when a buff fades.  Any buff you would cast on the puller should probably also be cast on the enchanter.  Dump the AC spells unless you have a ton of spare mana, I rarely use anything other than AoF (and that only because it is an armor effect).<P>Heals - Using CH takes experience, even the best make timing mistakes with it.  Use it when you feel comfortable that mis-timing will not cause a wipe out.  Make sure to take Jubal's comments to heart about types of heals.<P>Defense - I consider root and stun (L5 version) to be our most powerful spells.  I like it when that extra mob is beating on me, its means I can root park him and it gives the enchanter plenty of time to mez it.  Needless to say, AC is important to a cleric.<P>Offense - Level 5 stun is your friend, use it liberally.   If something is beating on your enchanter, stun the mob and then start healing the enchanter.  Heal the enchanter even if his life bar is not moving (that enchanter is taking damage but has rune up).<P>Judgement - Determine a priority list as the first thing you do in a group.  Enchanter is #1, you are #2, a big tank #3, etc..  In some cases someone is going to die, your job is to make sure the right people live so that the party survives.  <P>Groups - Remember the people that are good players, add them to your friend list.  Build a collection of people you can count on to make a good group, avoid those that cause problems in the past.  <P>Dungeons - I agree with most people, Karnor's is a place where other groups mistakes can get you killed.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
