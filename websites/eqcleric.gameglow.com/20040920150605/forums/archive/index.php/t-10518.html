<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">04-22-2001, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At 19th level I was still in High Pass and doing very well. Most of my groupmates had moved on to the Lake of Ill Omen so I was doing pick-up groups which I had mixed success with. I wasn't enjoying it as much, but the loot and exp was still good.<br />
<br />
I'd decided to head back to Greater Faydark to see my guildmates and try for the Prayer Cloth of Tunara (Gnome wisdom really low). My post about getting discouraged gave me some good information, and I decided to try for some wisdom items. <br />
<br />
I spent two days camping for the Warlord to show up which he never did. I did manage to help others kill DVin and Crush a couple times, and I got the Dwarven Ringmail Tunic. I don't care for camping much, was too boring, so I went to Unrest with my 18th level Paladin friend.<br />
<br />
In Unrest, we ran into a problem with all the Death Beatles swarming us. No exp, and wasting mana on heals. A skelleton from the house aggrod on us while dealing with the beatles, and we had to zone. <br />
<br />
After Zoning, we decided to try for some of the goblin bassun's or undertoe skelletons in the Cauldren. This went well, but those Tital Lords roamed everywhere and it was just too scary. I decided I'd had enough and took the boat to Kunark.<br />
<br />
Still 19th, I was told the trip would take about 70 minutes and was surprised that it took more like 10. At the docks in Firona Vie I bound myself at the bank and started off following the river to lake of ill omen.<br />
<br />
Right off the bat, a pirate cartographer killed me. I went back and on the way found someone feining death. I healed him and continued on to my corpse without incident. He'd ran into the pirate as well. Looted my corpse, and continued following the river.<br />
<br />
I swam right over one of the spider people, though I was told they would aggro on me. I've made the trip a few times more since then, and take care to avoid them but I don't know if they will attack or not. I figured if I swam right on top of one it would attack me if they were aggressive to me, but haven't tried conning them. Better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
Made it to the Lake, met up with my groupmates, and made 20th level in no time at all. I'm now a bubble away from 21st.<br />
<br />
One thing about those spider things, if they are aggressive, they are everywhere along the route. I died a couple times and went naked through them without a SoW just have to watch where you're heading. The aggro radius if it's there seems to be pretty small. A friend of mine, 20th level Ranger, tried getting through a couple times and kept dying to them.<br />
<br />
My group has been taking out Ice Skelletons, Warlord Skelletons, Warlord goblins, warrior goblins, and sarkak recruites. All of them Con red to me, but with a couple of tanks, a healer, and good group dynamics we did very well. I was the only one that ever dies (twice now) due to aggro in one case where the tanks just couldn't taunt it off me, and while the primary tank wewnt to fetch someone and the other group members went off somewhere and 3 sarnaks and a skelleton ambushed me. I lasted 3 seconds -g-.<br />
<br />
The ideal combo for group here in my case is:<br />
  2 tanks<br />
  1 shaman or druid<br />
  1 cleric<br />
<br />
We've also tried it with 2 clerics and a ranger which worked very well as well. About the only classes which we don't seem to need or want are Enchanters and Wizards. They seem to resist most of the spells we cast, and an enchanter in our group just hasn't been needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">05-06-2001, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bubble away from 24th, the Dracnids started killing Neiff when travelling through FV to the Lake of Ill Omen.<br />
<br />
After several deaths travelling through these zones to reach groups, I decided to give up on the Lake for awhile. Neiff was now one bubble into 22nd level - two more deaths and it would be two complete levels lost.<br />
<br />
I took her to the Temple Cazul-Thul(?) near the Trolls and Ogres, but it was empty. Went to Rathe Mountains and grouped with an SK there fighting cyclops and giant skelletons. We went to the temple later on and did very well, but it was impossible to do pick-up groups on later dates. I'd arrive and I'd be the only one in the temple.<br />
<br />
Went to South Karana and did very well there fighting aviaks and then gnolls. Got back the lost levels, and everything else after this belongs in a new post. The loot and exp was very good though :).</div></div><hr />
