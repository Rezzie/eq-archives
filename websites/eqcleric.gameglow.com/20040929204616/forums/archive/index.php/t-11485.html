<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DruBear</div><div class="date">09-03-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and dinged to 22 with a 21 War, 21 Necro, 21 Wiz and my cleric. We all dinged. Woot!<br />
<br />
We fought down to Bonecracker's room, broke with PBAOE and pulled elementals and guards into the room between pops. <br />
<br />
Was able to get two yelos and no deaths although it was close up top when we were moving around. No clarity or FT anywhere and I'm pretty sure we had a wee bit better than average gear (I have a couple pieces of Sol Ro armor, a VESM and a CGS.) <br />
<br />
The War was a main, and he grabbed most of the loot (various bronze and ringmail and some research components.) I got one Iron Oxide as the tradeskiller in the crowd. :)</div></div><hr />
