<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bree</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wanted to get a general opinion from people about items that drop and how loot should be dealt.<br />
<br />
I'll give you what I believe but it would be good to hear what the general concencus is on this matter.<br />
<br />
Recently, on my server Fennin Ro, there was a group of people in Karnor(which I wasn't a part of, However a fellow priest who will remain nameless  was there.  This cleric was grouped with a friend of mine, a Ranger.  they were camping the tower for the Drolvarg captain spawn.  Loot was not specified beforehand.<br />
<br />
This group kills the Captain and he has the Rare drop, Lupine Dagger.  There is one ranger in the group.  For those of you ho are unaware, a Lupine dagger is pretty whoop ass 9/18 effect: Greater wolf form. it IS Ranger ONLY.<br />
<br />
THe item drops the group decides that it should go to the Ranger, seems logical enough.  However, the Cleric, begins to whine and forces a roll saying he could use that item  to trade for clerical things.   They all roll, a bard wins, the bard hands the dagger to the ranger.  CLeric bitches and moans, the whole friggin zone ends up getting involved, on the side of the ranger, until comes to a point the Ranger is fed up and gives the dagger to the whining cleric.<br />
--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I have always been of the opinion that when I am grouped, even when loot is not specified beforehand, that anything that drops in which a specific class will use, it WILL always go to that person.  the only time I will roll on an item is when there is no one in the group that can use said item.  like a few days ago I won a soulbinder, which  is an SK only weapon.  there was no SK in group so the whole group rolled on it.<br />
<br />
Looking at that cleric makes me ashamed to be a member of the same class as him.  it made me ill to hear that these type of things are happening.  that a person would take away a piece of equipment that would better the class person you are grouped with.<br />
<br />
i know this type of bahavior goes on quite often but it truly makes me sad that people have become this greedy. No matter what group I am in I will always insist that loot first goes to those who would use it.<br />
<br />
BTW, this jacklip cleric ended up trading the dagger for an Iksar ceremonial chestplate. LMAO.  number 1 the dagger is far superior in trade value than that Chest piece.  Number 2 he stated he needed to dagger to trade for cleric equipment. I don't consider this BP cleric EQ, sure it would be nice to have afer all the tanks who can't heal get one first.  But it is a novelty item, not a necessary cleric piece.<br />
<br />
so, what say you clerics, how do you all feel on this subject?<br />

In a pickup group we all roll on an item.<br />
For my regular group it goes to whoever can use it. Then we either sell it off and split the winnings or trade it for something we can use.<br />
<br />
However for this situation, once the bard won the lotto then the cleric had no say in the matter and I would have told him to shove it up his ???<br />
<br />
Once you win the lotto what you do with the item is your business NO ONE elses. If the bard wanted to give it to the ranger then so be it.<br />
<br />
Also always always state the looting options when we start the group or whenever someone new comes in. If they dont like the options then they can leave. If they agree to it then so be it.<br />

<br />
But since so much great stuff drops in Kunark, we do the Class Specific items go to the particular classes first, mentality.<br />
<br />
If there's not that class in our group, then we all random for it.<br />
<br />
If it's a semi-specific...(i.e. War, SK, Pal, Cler, Bard), then only those folks who want to roll on it do.  The ALL/ALL stuff is pretty much randomed straight out, unless some groundrules have been laid beforehand.<br />
<br />
Some folks say things like &quot;I don't care about the rest of the drops, I just want XXX loot.  You can have everything else...&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naerik</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heya Bree!  Nice to see a face I know on these boards   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I do an awful lot more perusing then posting myself.<br />
  Anyways, I happened to be in zone when this particular incident occured, and I must say I was quite embarrassed of my class at that moment.  It seemed all the rangers in the zone were venting their frustration and complaining about &quot;greedy clerics&quot; after your friend let the zone know about what happened.  My beliefs are the same as yours, and in my experience with pick up groups it usually practiced that way as well.  All loot should go to those who need and will use.  If more than one person can use, then the item is rolled between them.  If no one can use, then everyone who hasn't gotten a uber item in that group yet rolls.  If something uber drops that can be used by a person who already has an uber item, then that person can't roll unless he puts his first item up for re-roll if he wins the current item.<br />
  Some might argue that everyone in a pick up group has an equal opportunity and equal deservedness on anything that drops, so everyone should roll on everything.  To these people I point to what Verant did in the planes.  Making all planar armor no drop, it made loot awarding in the planes much easier and PLooting less of a problem.  A planar item will always go to someone who can use.  Why should the Kunark loot be any different?  In a lot of cases this stuff is better than what we get in the planes.  Making the Kunark armor drops droppable, among the other uber loot, has been a debatable decision by Verant, but I think it was the right move.  Especially considering the faction issues with the VS dungeons, making it impossible for the evil races who wish to still visit Overthere get any loot from said dungeons except through gifts and trades.  And because getting this loot doesn't require the force of a large scale raid in most cases, there is more of a chance that something will drop that is unusable by the classes present.  Making it droppable, nothing is going to rot...<br />
  Okay, that's my 2 cp on the issue.  In my particular opinion, that cleric was very self-centered in his decision.  His name is pretty popular on Fennin for what he did, if he wasn't a cleric he'd probably have a lot of trouble finding groups anymore   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennan</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A tale I heard goes like this;<br />
<br />
A Warrior is in a AM group and the SMR drops. He wins it. Another player then procedes to whine about it etc etc. So the Warrior gives him the item. A couple of hours later they are both in the frenzy group, and the FBSS drops. This time the other player wins it. The tank asks the other guy if he can have it, as he gave the player a SMR. The player replies, better go practice your rolling.<br />
<br />
If people whine for no good reason, giving them an item will do nothing. I know this as I have done the same thing that Ranger did in the original post. They are just plain greedy, and will keep it up if all they have to do is whine to get an item at the end of the day. That Ranger got sucked in, next time he should just ignore the other player, or if not possible leave the group. And try and avoid grouping with that person again.<br />
<br />
Sometimes its better to just walk away from people like that and have an early night.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its so much easier grouping with ya guild - lewt rules just don't apply.<br />
<br />
In general in pickup groups the looting rules depends on the location and the group composition.  Certain dungeons are catered to drop certain classes armour and such.  Everyone rolling on an item is in general the safest method because it averages out the loot.  For example you might be in an area that is 60% tank (hybrids and such) loot, 40% pure caster lewt and 0% priest loot.  Now is it really fair to only have the classes who can use the item roll? if you are sharing everything fairly experience and loot then no because as we can see priest classes get jack diddly.  If it was a little more fair or the quality of said items in a low chance slot was high enough then it would be fair just to roll on what came up.<br />
<br />
The cleric had a right to roll on said item if there was also no understanding (or previous transaction) that all cleric loot would go to them.  His or other peoples motives might remain unclear, he might want to give it to a ranger guildmate (knowning that it would benifit someone he knew - something that most people would rather see i'm sure), he might want to swop it for an uber spell that would help everyone he groups with (mark of karn anyone?).<br />
<br />
That said if someone wins something its entirely upto them what they do with it.<br />
<br />
This is why grouping with ya guild/friends or making the loot rules aparant early on are of absolute importance</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the group all agrees otherwise, then a change in rules is fair.<br />
<br />
But it is not fair to tell anyone &quot;You did 1/6 of the work, but since this item is not usable by your class, you can't have it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And the original cleric had the right to demand a roll. But to whine AFTER the roll? Now that is stupid!<br />

I have left 3 parties who refused upon 3 requests to discuss loot. I have no idea why some parties feel like they should not discuss loot.<br />
<br />
Number 2 Error: After having a 'fair' roll and the Bard won and of their own will handed it to the ranger (as I might have done myself) the ranger handed the item upon contious whining of the cleric. The error here is the cleric should have been disbanded and not handed the item. If that breaks the party so be it, but when someone insists on a loot roll and then loses they had better just shut up or get out.<br />

People have very different ideas about loot, but it's not fair to tell someone they cannot random, post hoc.<br />
<br />
So IMHO this cleric was perfectly within his rights to insist on a random.<br />
<br />
That being done, what is this nonsense about him continuing to whine AFTER HE LOST THE RANDOM?  The dagger belonged to the bard, he could give it to anyone he damn well pleased.  I would have booted the cleric for this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always play it if an item drops that's class specific and that class is in the group - it goes to them.<br />
<br />
If some one starts whinning that they want the item and it's not for their class - I give them the option to buy it from the group or I kick them out of the group.<br />

Now of course you don't have these problems when you work with your regular group...<br />

If someone insisted on rolling for an item that they could not use (but another group member can and will use) I would let them roll, and kick them out the moment the winner was determined. Their phat lewt, no matter what they can trade it for, won't help them when the best players avoid them like a plague.<br />
<br />
Do you want melees rolling on those adamantite epolets? Casters challenging you for that BEBP? It's like druids doing cleric quests to sell the armor for cash. Very poor form.<br />
<br />
People who are so selfish I find to be poor groupmates anyway - really good teams function out of selflessness.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just spoiled after working with so many excellent players recently.<br />
<br />
In the situation you described, kudos to the bard who gave the dagger to the ranger. His actions are a model of proper behavior in such a situation. I hope for your sake you never end up in a group with that cleric again. (But you can send the bard my way.)<br />

I've never had a loot problem, in pickup-groups we've always rolled, and the item generally went to the person who needed it the most.  I'm in agreement that the cleric in question was well within his rights to request a roll.  It's the whining part that gets me.  A general practice with the people I regularly group with is when we find someone like this, we boot them out of the group and blacklist/ignore them.  If enough people do this, then maybe the person in question will see that his/her behavior accomplishes nothing and will change their ways.  If not, at least I won't have to listen to them anymore  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

The monk did a noble thing and gave it to a player that could have used it. I would have been burned up if I was the monk and the  whining brat got the dagger. Everyone can use better items but when every does lotto you don't whine about it. I'm kind of suprised to see  someone that high level whine. IMO if you let a whinner have his/her way, it just justifies that it pays to whine. <br />
   In principle, the group leader should have told the cleric in a diplomatic manner to lay off. If that doesn't work that cleric should have been replaced at the soonest available opportunity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figure what goes around comes around, so in that cleric's position I would not even have rolled, or if the members insisted I roll, I would have done as the bard did, had I won.  I did something similar with bard boots in Karnor not too long ago.<br />
<br />
What would have been ideal is for the looting to have been worked out beforehand, as many have said.  It was not, so the fact that the roll took place at all is not so unusual, given that it was a pick-up group.  Then it would be left to the individuals to do what they wished with the item (with the bard having acted admirably).<br />
<br />
What I find mind-boggling is that the subsequent argument happened AT ALL.  After insisting that he get a chance to roll, then contesting the results?  What, are his dice rolls somehow weighted more than others?  That's just bizarre.  I can't see how he could possibly justify it or even try to.<br />

<br />
Clerics are getting bad reputations anymore it seems like.  I worry that it might be soloers that never grouped and were unable to get groups due to their class/lack of skill thinking that they need to be a necessary class to get a group.  They decide to uber-twink and powerlevel their own Cleric to higher levels and are now grouping without understanding the basics of the class, or their role in a group!  Having invested such time and effort in the name of getting a group, they seem to feel they deserve the lion share of the loot.  Sadly, even a badly played Cleric is desired, but not liked in the least.  This causes problems for people that created a Cleric because we hated seeing people get killed.<br />
<br />
I was not powerleveled.  I had no clue that Clerics were an &quot;uber class&quot; when I made one.  I spent long periods when I couldn't find a group because there were Shamans and Druids around that could heal as well, nuke efficiently, and cast SOW.  So the Cleric can Revive someone back?  Well, the Druid/Shaman can SOW and we are far less likely to need a Revive.  Besides, we can get a Revive from the Cleric sitting at the zone waiting for a group...<br />
<br />
And so, those of us who have suffered the agony of levels where our heals were awesome taunts, are being brought down by those who have been powerleveled.  The plus side is that your reputation follows you at higher levels.  Eventually, you can't escape it and would be better off being naked, than having your name above your uber equipped form.  The down side is that we are watched closer than others due to our &quot;priveledged&quot; status.  Even reasonable actions can grow in the telling when attributed to a Cleric.  The rumor mill watches us, and we are more vulnerable than most due to that.<br />
<br />
That cleric's days are numbered as anything other than a &quot;res mule&quot;.  I wish the Ranger well, he did Clerics a great service when he gave the dagger to the cleric.<br />
