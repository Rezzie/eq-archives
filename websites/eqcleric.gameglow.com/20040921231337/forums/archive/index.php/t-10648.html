The loot is pretty poor. But by Brell is the experience insane. All across the zone, people are shouting, &quot;Is anyone else's experience bar moving faster than a green mob in Guk?&quot;<br />
<br />
In a three-man group, consisting of a Warrior, a Rogue, &amp; myself, I was seriously getting 1 non-hell bubble an hour. We were just doing single pulls to the Skyfire zone. The warrior was just shooting arrows, bring them in. 20 seconds later he was off again. I felt like I was being powerleveled.<br />
<br />
Rogues, btw, are my new favorite class. They do insane backstab damage &amp; with the Warrior taunting &amp; themselves evading, I only had to throw about 2 greater heals an hour on them for those few times when evade didn't work. (Even then, I really didn't have to heal them, just felt like toping them back up to full health after the fight). It was nice only having to worry about the Warrior's health.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would let you in to what I consider my new favorite zone. Good times.<br />
