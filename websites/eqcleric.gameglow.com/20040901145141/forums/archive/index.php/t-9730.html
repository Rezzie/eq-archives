<br />
Last night, I handed a Dwarven mace and a prayer cloth to the Elvish Priest to get my Screaming Mace (As it's lore I already sold my old one)<br />
<br />
He said thank you, I gained XP and went to equip my mace to find.... NOTHING !!!!<br />
<br />
I petitioned, 5 hours later I still hadn't got a reply.  A GM came on the server, I gave him a tell, he logged without even talking to me.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to spend another 5 hours without XP camping the Warlord for another BoB.  I have already had to buy a GLS to see with.<br />
<br />
How do you actually get some support out of EQ, being in Australia I’m never on during US working Hours ???<br />

However it only contained fact, that was the thing that annoyed me most.<br />
<br />
As far as I know EQ doesn’t have a customer service section, if they have, they have never contacted me   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
Perhaps it’s a myth, kind of like Blige spawning in DC or the Loch Ness Monster ?<br />

<br />
I did exactly as you described, and had done<br />
it once before, alas i got xp but no mace.<br />
<br />
I petitioned and got a GM reply about how they could no nothing to help me.<br />
<br />
I always thought it had something to do with me having a few Legionnare shoulderpads in the backpack, but i never was sure.<br />
<br />
Later i did the quest for a 3rd time, and got the mace, so im 2 for 3 )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whackem Smackem</div><div class="date">11-22-1999, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get the mace, you must have an open inventory space in your main inventory. So if you have 8 items, you don't get a mace, if you have 7 items, and no other items, you get a mace. Follow me? If your only open space is in a bag, you WILL NOT get the mace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarLocke</div><div class="date">11-22-1999, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, this is a generic quest bug.  A couple weeks ago there was a rash of postings at &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://www.soerbaird.com/shaman&quot;&amp;gt;The SHaman's Crucible&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; about people doing the totemic armor quests, getting exp, but not getting armor.<br />
<br />
I had thought this bug had been fixed.  Apparently not 8(.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domanic</div><div class="date">11-24-1999, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, It's been 3 days now and my petitions keep getting removed but I haven't even been sent a reply to my E-mail (2 Days response, what a joke).<br />
<br />
I think I will just contest my membership fee when it comes up on the Visa on the grounds that I am paying for a service that they are failing to provide (an Australian trade practices Law, umm, I wonder if it stands true for international transactions ??).  Anyhow, It only costs $10 to contest a Visa bill, it should be a lot of fun to see what happens.<br />
<br />
Hehehe, perhaps I could take it further.  If I have to camp the Warlord again that’s 5 hours out of my life, If I work that out at my current rate of pay it will cost me about $200 to correct their bug.  I can send them a bill for that too  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif (OK, so I haven’t got a legal leg to stand on with this one, but it would be funny to see their reply)<br />
<br />
If they just turn around and delete my account they lose out anyhow, as that means I wont be buying the upgrade, paying further membership fees and you can be sure I will be buying Asheron’s Call the next day.  <br />
<br />
After all, it’s not like they have a monopoly in the market any more, if they continue to provide poor customer support to their customers who are victimised by defects in their product, eventually they won’t have any left.<br />
