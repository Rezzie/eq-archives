<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">12-20-1999, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I'm having a bit of an issue with a GM change, and this is a rant, alright. Our old GM was pretty into roleplaying, and keeping people interested in events happening on the server. Since then, we've gotten a new GM. Their policy is pretty much &quot;We're customer service, not roleplayers, the roleplaying is up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Here's my rant:<br />
<br />
Since when did a GM do something in the situations where bugs are involved?<br />
<br />
I actually hunted Maugarim down twice yesterday as the first Maugarim corpse fell into a wall or a floor (She had room not to, but she did somehow), and we lost the loot, as we couldn't /corpse it out of the wall or floor. So we settled in for another hour or two until she respawned. <br />
<br />
Took screenshots of where it said she died, people are still casting in the screenshot, and that's apparently not good enough proof for them. Best answer I get is &quot;Sorry it got stuck in a wall.&quot;<br />
<br />
Add that kind of answer up with &quot;We are customer service&quot; and &quot;The roleplay is up to you&quot;, and I'm kinda peeved. Trying to get my char transfered to another server at this point, and if that doesn't happen, deleting it, and moving to a different server to play, IF I keep playing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heklar</div><div class="date">12-20-1999, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually found support from GMs has gotten alot better as time goes on. The first times I ever talked to a GM they wouldn't do anything for me, anything from a server crash to other stuff that's their fault I ate. Recently with server crashes I've found GMs and what not actually doing rezzes for people. I still think it takes an absurd amount of time. I waited around an hour to get a rez from them, but I got knocked back into a hell lvl so I didn't mind too much.<br />
<br />
I really think people ALWAYS bitch when they don't get helped, but then alot of people don't even mention it when they do get helped. Verant GMs get labeled as the laziest people in the world, but I really don't know about that, I've seen people get plenty of stuff back.<br />
<br />
As far as the roleplaying end I have found the GMs TOTALLY suck at this. Hands down every GM quest I've been involved in has been total crap.<br />
<br />
The first one I did was in befallen, a DE sk and some Lady he kept calling the chosen one were in the Nektulos forest, so my wizard friend and I went to see, lvl 34 cleric, lvl 28 wiz, lvl 11 sk and lvl 9 warrior all wander to befallen, we goto the 3rd floor, kill this spawn yadda yadda, the GM NPCs thank us, the wizard is the only one that gets an item and he gets barbed legs, then the GMs Gate, I look to the left, and here's the lvl 9 and 11. The GM just abandoned them on the 3rd floor of befallen, with no keys, and they've never been there. I go kill the sk with my wizard and give them the keys, then help them out but that was TOTALLY lame. that and I could have gotten those barbed legs in like 20 mins, but instead I followed these GMs around for 2 hours who didn't even make an attempt at making an interesting story for a quest and then abandoned the poor low levels they carried around, fork that. I mean really, I wouldn't even care if I got an item from a GM quest if they made a good attempt at some sort of story, that's what I goto GM events for, a plot and interaction that you can't create via NPCs, but I swear the could have scripted the GMs I was following around *sigh*.<br />
<br />
My second adventure was even worse. Again my wizzy friend and I found a GM controlled NPC in Nektulos, he told us to goto WC so we went, upon getting there we heard a whole story about how the QUeen of Neriak has been kidnapped and taken to Highhold and we need to free her. For this quest I was there with about 60 other people. So we raid highhold and for the next 4 hours we kill more then half the NPCs in Highhold looking for information, we enentually find that a key we need is on the captain outside. ( As a note players started training us in highhold about half way through this and by the time we went outside we only had like 20 ppl left that weren't totally frustrated ). So we go outside and find this captain, he's surrounded by all these NPCs and more of us die, by now this is totally breaking up, but my group is determined to finish it on our own, we'd just have to be more careful. So we find a quiet corner and pulled NPCs one by one till we killed the captain. We didn't get the key so we figured maybe it's on a different NPC so we started pulling all the NPCs in front of the castle. After we killed 90% of the highhold population without finding the key I was getting really pissed off. So I shouted some very bad things about GMs I'll not go into exactly words, and poof. instantly I get a response from an Admin-GM. They ask what I'm talking about, I tell them the whole story, the NPC that sent us on this and everything. He says interesting, I ask him what's up and he says, &quot;There is no GM event planned for today&quot;, I'm like WHAT?????, and I ask and ask and ask what's going on and I never get another response from anyone, petitioned and everything, noone would answer me, that totally pissed me off.<br />
<br />
So anyway I think the Roleplay / Game intervention on GMs behalf is the worst I've ever seen, it's really too bad cause it could really give EQ a boost it needs.<br />

I got a third name from the butcherblock hammer quest on sol ro and it took almost 8 hours for the whole quest to run. Now, I'm pretty much parking the character, so I get to go from a 31 cleric down to a level 5 cleric on the nameless.<br />
