Dang if I didn't find a solo clerics dream... Unrest might be loaded with undead and awesome and all... but you see people there and are at their mercies if the train rolls...<br />
When you zone into Ill Omen from FV... go out the alleyway area by the stream... when you are clear take a left turn and stick to the wall... you will come to a place close by... showing crumbling temple and iksar statues... At level 20 there i had no problem getting a bit more then a bubble of xp and hour... Sabretooth Tigers and Tigress... Sarnak Conscripts... Flunkies.. Goblin Agressor and Battlemasters... and short of having that annoying token Necro to screw up sense the dead... various blue conning skelies... In a 6 hour stint that I was there I think I counted maybe at most 4 or 5 people...<br />
Definently a place to go... the oasis of Kunark it seems... and the great thing about it was the fact that with the loot that was dropped I actually made enuff money to cover reagent costs and still have some left over...<br />

That is where some of us are currently.  Aviak Avocates are the best.  :o)<br />

I got my 23rd level last night and now only one more until my greater heals.. woohoo!!  :o)<br />
