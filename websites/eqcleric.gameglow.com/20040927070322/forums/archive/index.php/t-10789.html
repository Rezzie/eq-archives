<br />
Until lvl 54, the spectrals in TT are pretty good (as mentioned in other mails), but at lvl 54 or 55, the exp dries out there.<br />
<br />
I have found 2 other possibilities:<br />
1. Soloing in Karnors Castle.<br />
This was recommended in another mail on the General board recently. It works fine if there are not many people in Karnors, but when many people are pulling to the zone or moats, it becomes too crowded. Difficult to pull something and difficult to fight without disturbing the other groups.<br />
<br />
2. Soloing in Timorous Deep<br />
The raptors in the south-west corner of this zone are good exp for a lvl 55 cleric. Just be careful to always single pull them, as they are pretty tough. Takes about 80% of my mana with WIS 198.<br />
The bad things about the raptors are partly that they drop extremely lousy loot (1 spell component for each 5 raptors) and partly the zone (difficult to come to as it requires a boat and not good for finding a pickup group if you become tired of soloing).<br />
<br />
I often do RL work while soloing. For that purpose TD is pretty good. Fight 2-3 minutes followed by up to 10 minutes 'working break'. For soloing a bit while waiting for a group, I definitely do not recommend TD.<br />
<br />
