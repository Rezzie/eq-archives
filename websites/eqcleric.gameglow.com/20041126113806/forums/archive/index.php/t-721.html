And yes, Death Pact does save the pet from suicide. How do you think I got this pic?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

*shrug* Not too surprised if they fixed it where you can't use Death Pact anymore. Was spammed all over the Whineplay boards.<br />

already, so enjoy it while it is still possible.<br />
<br />
Every cleric who knows anything don't<br />
say a word about this capability to<br />
anyone.<br />
<br />
Consider it a secret of the art<br />
that only the Master Clerics know.<br />
<br />
Others can find out on their own.<br />
<br />
Including Verant.</div></div><hr />

Even greater kobolds kill the pet before you can cast death pact and a buff on it. <br />
So basically they took only a semi useful pet away from clerics..not like it was that great or anything...It took nearly all my mana to make and buff the damn thing anyway.<br />
<br />
But my point is that now it is totally useless and that pisses me off.<br />
**** verant.</div></div><hr />

(Yes, I am a cleric, and I do have both of those spells.  However, I have no problem with Verant fixing obvious bugs.)<br />

Ah, it appears Verant, in their infinite wisdom lacked the foresight to realise that the hated cleric class could take Useless Spell A. and use in conjunction with Useless Spell B. and come up with an Equally Useless Pet, but at least one that allowed you to get some attention and provide a laugh or two.<br />
Well, God forbid they give us anything to smile about...and even though the pet would live with DeathPact (until killed or DP wore off) it was still A Waste of Mana. And not even CLOSE to &quot;Unbalancing&quot; tm.<br />
(and oh yes, even with full buffs it still sucked)<br />
<br />
Not a &quot;bug&quot;, it was an &quot;Oversight&quot; that was hardly a threat to anyone. Unless having a good chuckle now and again is a threat.<br />
Screw them for taking my fun toy away.<br />

All tanks are Cleric pets.<br />

Every time they nerf our pets they just make them more useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jovius</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What i want to know is how is that an exploit? Not like Verant gives us exact uses of every spell we get and what its meant for. Someone that was playing around with the pet discovered this, either through ingenuity or by accident.. and we actually found a use for our pet, besides a POINTLESS mana drain on us. So what if it was good for clearing a few mid 20s mobs.. it would still die unless you buff the junk out of it. I never ever used this pet to solo a blue mob. and if i had tried i know he would be dead.<br />
<br />
My first time posting here, that comment about this being an 'exploit' makes me mad, This was cleary not an exploit.. and how is one to know if deathpact was not intended to keep our pet alive? And they just changed their minds? Thats right it was a stealth nerf.... If it was a exploit ya think they would ban someone for this Joke of a pet? I dont think so. Not for one second.<br />
<br />
Not only was this not an Exploit, but it is not a bug either.  It wasnt a feature so what was it? Just a unintended use of deathpact? Your telling me we have to use 5pp reagent , not to mention if we symbol it, and over 1200 worth of mana for this pet and its Unbalancing? Give me a break! Compare that to others pets requirements, then tell me how long you laughed<br />
<br />
Currently there is no use for this spell other than to show someone what a cleric pet looks like.. I challenge anyone, to show me that 600 mana is worth this.<br />

Although I am not a moderator, I can say you are BOTH WAY out of line for the insults. Keep it to clean and logical posts, this isn't Whineplay.<br />
<br />
And Wisecleric,<br />
<br />
That petty little insult was just uncalled for. Guild specific whines should be left to server specific forums, and not a discussion on a clerical spell here.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember which thread it was where I told a couple people to be nice, but thanks for catching this one.  I was out on my lunch break so I didn't catch it sooner.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nige Willowleaf</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Boanerges you caught a pic of my pet in Sebilis   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Shortly after that Verant took away our ability to use Death Pact on it. So Hammer boy goes to the back of the book again. <br />
<br />
The Hammer could do about 1500 damage during a fight with an Ilis or a Jugger. It could NOT tank even with buffs, there had to be a real tank keeping the mob agro. The longest I kept it alive was 3 hours by casting DP on myself first, then the pet so I could refresh DP before it dropped. I did get messages that buffs left the pet. It died when I had to zone from Trakanon on the bridge   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif (oops)<br />
<br />
to Wisecleric : gosh can't you leave all that political junk about my guild on CTC? or at least use your own name here? It wasn't an exploit. I agree it was an unintended use of two spells but that to me is no different than discovering the spot in Skyfire where mobs don't wander so you can pull safely to it. (yes it is there) It isn't an exploit to learn something about the game to be a smarter player. It is an exploit to use a flaw in the game to kill things you could never kill unless you used the exploit.<br />
<br />
Plus the pet was fun and did a little bit of melee damage. It was one of the few fun things a cleric ever got after 54 hard levels. Oh ok ok   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ...it is fun grouping with other good players, killing interesting mobs in interesting places, and getting neat loots. That is enough for me so I am not complaining too much about losing the pet.<br />
