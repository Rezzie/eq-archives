<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">04-15-2001, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nothing really current in this catagory, so here's my experiences in Unrest, Oasis and High Pass per the recommendations on this board.<br />
<br />
At 14 I grouped with a friend of mine, a lvl 15 Paladin and we went to Unrest to try it out.<br />
<br />
The exp was very good, and probably because we're on the new split server (always forget it's name) it was empty except for some high-level folks in the House.<br />
<br />
Taking some advice from these boards, we headed over to the Gazebo where we died fairly quickly. We decided to stay at the enterence and just pull into there. Didn't have a problem with trains since nobody was there except the 50+ folks in the house.<br />
<br />
Thinking we could take a group into the gazebo area and reduce downtime, we grabbed a few more folks (all lower level than us) where all but one person died in the Cauldron along the way due to the Goblin Lords. By the time we actually got to Unrest everyone was pretty disheartened at the amount of time it took due to dying and regrouping. We pulled a few things then called it quits.<br />
<br />
Still 14 (me the cleric) and the 15 paladin headed up to Oasis and tried the crocs at the dock. We ran into some problems with a tank that just liked to pull everything; also some spectre things that conned red to me started showing up and after one killed my paladin friend, we decided to join another group that was doing the orc highway.<br />
<br />
At 14, the exp and loot seemed to be very good here. We had a very good group and did well. An occasional sand giant or train would interrupt things, but for the most part everyone was able to escape without dying. I made 15 and the exp seemed to slow down, but was still decent.<br />
<br />
After several hours of (we were all on for over 12hrs each) this, our group leader asked if we'd like to try High Pass. He was the only one that had been there before, so we headed off to High Pass. The place was empty (again, like Unrest on this server it just isn't crowded). <br />
<br />
Within a short period of time I gained 16th level and the exp is still good. I've increased my bank roll by about 30 plat and was able to purchase the rest of my lvl 14 spells.<br />
<br />
I went back to town the next day and tried the Orc Highway again with my paladin friend (we're both 16 at this time). Exp had definately slowed down and the group we were with at the time wasn't really sharing in the loot, so very poor for me as well. <br />
<br />
In all of these places I went (Oasis, N.Ro,S.Ro,EC,WC,High Pass) I was constantly getting tells asking if I'd join a group, even when just passing through to the next zone. <br />
<br />
I'm currently contemplating between Unrest or HighPass and think I'll stick with HighPass. Since it's empty of people most of the time, if no group is forming I can work on trade skills and such, wheras in Unrest I pretty much need a tank to do well and few people wander in around my level. In either place I could spend some downtime waiting for a group, and in High Pass I'd have something to do during this time.<br />
<br />

Being a Cazic-Thule server ..it was always busy which was actually good because I had no probs finding a group.  Then at 16 I moved to High hold and grouped there till lvl 20.  There was always a party killing orcs there.  And I usually got in first try.  If not I'd kill the gnolls till a spot opened.  THe loot and money were free-flowing.  At lvl 20 I headed to South Karana ..and once again had zero problems grouping</div></div><hr />
