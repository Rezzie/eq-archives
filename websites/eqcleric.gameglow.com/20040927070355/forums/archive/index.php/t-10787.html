I recommend grouping with a lvl 50+ magician.  I'm a 52 cleric, and I've been spending lots of time there with a 52 mage.  He get's his earth pet up (yes, earth), I buff it up.  Pulling singles in SF is relatively safe and easy.  Just sit back and watch the pet tank.  We've taken down elder wyverns, wurms, even named spawns with ease.  Dropping level 52 mobs is done quite easily, and we've been quite successful with loot.  Btw, dropping a 52 wyvern usually puts me down about 3 bubbles of mana.  I always keep a mod rod on me, just in case.  Many spells drop here - this zone is a caster's dream.  Oh yea, we usually set up right outside the BW zone.<br />
<br />
Now most of you are saying - earth pet?  Let me explain.  Earth is used for a few reasons.  First, unless you want to have a very long pull back to near the zoneline, fear kiting could get ugly.  The pathing isn't that great, and you could get adds as the mob runs back out into the zone.  Second, when fighting 50+ mobs, you may get summoned.  However, mobs can't summon if they are rooted - hence the earth pet.  Third, if your mage is good, he will engage his pet right when the mob is directly over the pet.  When root hits, the mob will attack the closest thing to it - this will be the earth pet, as the pet is right underneath it.  This keeps the agro on the pet and not on you, if for some chance you get within melee range.  On a side note there - by doing this, you can group with a melee class.  Just have the pet in the center of the mob, and the meleer can fight without being hurt.<br />
<br />
Well, that's it.  I hope this helps.  My thanks go out to Aniuar - your pet handling skills are second to none.<br />

A short stint in SF has nearly made me KOS to Gorenaire in DL.  I haven't been back to SF since I travel through the DL tunnel often and don't want the hassle of Gorenaire wacking me.<br />
<br />
About Sebilis, went there for the first time last night. Full group of levels 52,52,53,54,56 and me 51.  It took 28 kills before I got movement on my exp bar.<br />
<br />
I hear Howling Stones is great exp so I will work on getting my key soon.</div></div><hr />

One kill of a dragon must be at least -500 negative faction...</div></div><hr />

Yes, I've said it before and I'll happily say it again:<br />
Grouping with a mage is one of the best combos in the game. Especially if he knows what he's doing and got the earth pet out.<br />
I've gotten SO MANY xp duoing with a mage partner.<br />

And SF is a very good place to grab spells in.<br />

I have a mage friend that will be &quot;of age&quot; very soon to group with.  Any other place that you suggest for a 50+ Cleric and Mage to hunt in?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Although some craighs are green you should do well here. I got my 2nd Forrest Loop there yesterday  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
And you might see the named giant Gorgul, who can drop the Treeweave, but he was cheap on us yesterday, all we got was a lousy AotIB  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
Almost forgot, the ancient giants can drop spells as well, our druid got a L52 spell there, and he didn't have that one yet  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
