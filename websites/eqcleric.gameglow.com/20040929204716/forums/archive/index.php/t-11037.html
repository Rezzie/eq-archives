By either clicking the graphic on the home page or registering above this site will be credited with referring a customer to Flashlink.  If we refer enough customers (I never was told the threshold for &quot;enough&quot;) we get free hosting.  Free hosting is nice =).  No money out of my pocket and no pay-pal donations from you.<br />
<br />
I've been a Flashlink customer for many months as I find several sites, EQ Maps, EQ'Lizer, and EQ Spoilers, to be extremely valuable.  It's quite worth the $3.45/month, or $2.08/month if you sign up for an entire year.<br />
<br />
So, if you're not already a customer and wish to support this site I would appreciate it if you signed up for Flashlink by clicking the link above.<br />

(Hope this doesn't read too much as an advertisement =P)</div></div><hr />
