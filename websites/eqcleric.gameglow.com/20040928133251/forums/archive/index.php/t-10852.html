Temple of Veeshan crashed.  Another raid showed up and I have noticed that with 2 raids (1 giant/1 dragon) and the # of people in the zone around 60-70 it starts lagging pretty bad on our server.  Well, we had a bit more then your average raid since it was Dozekar and all...so zone crashed.  Then people had to go for RL stuff...but we'll kill him yet.</div></div><hr />

Its not unusual to have raids going on in the north wing, west wing, halls of testing and 4way room at the same time.<br />
