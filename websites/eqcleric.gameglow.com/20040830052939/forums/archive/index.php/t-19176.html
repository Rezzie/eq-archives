<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelariel</div><div class="date">07-05-2004, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're a friendly, chatty Euro times raid guild based in the UK, and raid generally Sunday to Thursday from around 7pm UK time to midnight (2pm-7pm EST).  Where you live isn't important, when you can raid is :)<br />
<br />
Dark Templars have killed Quarm, and are enjoying GoD raids so far  -we're on the verge of entering Uqua where hopefully our feelings about the expansion won't change too much :p  having a Time flag and/or the Vxed+Tipt trial flags will be big plusses but are not considered essential.  We are looking at applications from all classes currently, though as always some (clerics) are higher need than others.  What we really, really want is highly active players who enjoy raiding - everything else can be worked on.<br />
<br />
Cross-server applications are welcomed, and we've had some great successes with them in the past.  As a Euro guild on a US server we have been largely free of server drama, contested spawns and racing for targets that US guilds have had to put up with, and this comfortable position is something we really appreciate!  If you can regularly make our raid times and want to join for Quarm killing and exploring deeper into GoD, please post an application, drop me an email or send a cross-server ;tell to xegony.avelariel<br />

This sounds like a personal ad eh...A/S/L ? :P</div></div><hr />
