<br />
Last evening had this happening to me in Fungus Grove...<br />
<br />
We had been in a great solid group (mostly guildies) pulling solid for 3+ hours.  We had an awesome 59 non-guildy bard pulling and doing crowd control.  The situation started like this...We had 3 shrooms lined up ...MA and group minus bard were on 1st shroom while bard had 2 shrooms mezzed under his control. I had already MoKed all 3 of our targets (gotta love POG BP) All of the sudden I see a werewolf (PC with chanter buff) run across my field of view with 3 shrooms in tow... For some reason he ran closer to us and into the fungus patch we had been pulling from and then he aggroed even more on him... I think to myself I sure hope he knows what he's doing.  He might have been trying to pull back to an AE group but unknown.  He then tries to run and apparently had trouble, probably stuns and slows from shrooms.  I do a quick /who xxxx and discover he is a 59 level player!  By now he has like six mobs on him wailing away and I tell the group /g train close...careful  About as soon as I said this, the 59 player goes down and all 6 mobs now join our party since shrooms are highly social....It wasn't pretty...I yelled run but no one made it from our group...To make matters worse...These mobs then proceeded to train around and kill most of the zone as they went to aggro on other nearby groups...It was a nasty chain reaction  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
End of story, I ran back to the zone and ended up rezzing most of the zone....I even rezzed the foolish person who trained us though I said a few choice words to him about his pulling skills.<br />
<br />
Moral- Be careful in new zones as pullers are acting like newbies. Folks are pulling thinking they can handle any situation with an abundance of overconfidence.  It is much easier to rez ONE person who maybe had a bad pull and bit the bullet for the team than to try to continue the pull and end up killing a lot of people and ruin an evening of fun.  <br />

<br />
With all of the new &quot;easy exp&quot; zones like velks and now the new expansion expect to see tons of &quot;newbs&quot; hitting even level 60 with no dungeon skills whatever.<br />
<br />
You'd think this could not happen but it's starting to become fairly prevelant.<br />
