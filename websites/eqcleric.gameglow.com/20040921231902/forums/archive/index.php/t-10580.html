near the Rathe Mtn zone. At level 33 half of these con blue to me. <br />
<br />
With the expulse summoned spell doing 94 damage for 60 mana you can root/nuke these very quickly. Be carefull to pull to the zone line if you are the only one hunting these as they are Social. I often have 3-4 greenies rooted as I kill one or 2 blues.<br />
<br />
Happy hunting<br />

<br />
One tactic I use on avocets is root/fear, wrath, wrath, fear, wrath, etc... actually this also worked well on a centaur charger who in melee was hitting me for 70+.<br />
<br />
(I am also admittedly jealous of the level 30 wizard/enchanter/magician types who can solo avocets easy.)<br />

Harriers on the other hand are possible but still pretty dangerous. Make sure you've got your technique down pat and you'll get great exp.<br />

Being at lvl 30, Personally I would try to join a hill giant group full of 34 and 36 players... At least here they will love you for your heals and make money in the mean time.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
