<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krixxor</div><div class="date">02-20-2000, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow.  There doesn't seem to be much activity in this particular forum.  I thought I would post a few ideas on where to hunt between these lvls, since this is currently where I am.  At this point, I prefer to play it safe.  I've not taken a serious plunge into any dungeons such as Guk or Cazic.  I'm sure it about time, but I'm hesitant for some reason.  <br />
<br />
For Dark races, the best place I've found to hunt is the Treants in South Karana.  I went from lvl 23-30 here in 6 days, and banked about 1500pp in the process.  I strayed from the for a bit, but came back for lvl 30 and 31.  I worked through the hell lvl here in 2 days, and lvl 31 in one evening.  If you are fearful of faction hits, consider this.  You are probably already KOS at the Druid rings if you are a dark race...just get a camo before TPing anywhere.  Once you are done hunting Treants, spend a few days killing Bandits in NK, SK, or LR.  I say bandits because they improve both your Queynos and Highhold faction.  Highhold is important because as a dark race, you can never have enough places to bank.  <br />
<br />
For light and dark races, I suggest the Gnolls outside of Paw in SK.  This exp is a bit slower because everybody seems to want to hunt there in a full group.  This really isn't necessary at 3 of the spawn spots.  I got much better exp there in a small group of 3 or 4, depending on the lvls of the folks in the group.  Avocets and Harrier in Aviak Village are still viable with a partner to help out.  Aviak Village seems to be much less packed these days, but you still have to go hunt the birds, vice having a nice convenient spawn right in front of you (IE Paw and the Treants).  <br />
One more comment on the treants is that they still con formidable blue to me at lvl 32..I could probably still hunt these for one more lvl.  But, the treant groups are very difficult to get in, so be prepared to wait for a group.  Definately try to get on their group waiting list.  It will be worth your time.  <br />
Now that I've reached lvl 32 though, I'm going to get a bit of a cushion and probably head for cazic thule.  Hope this helps a bit with anybody who is roaming around lost, with no ideas on where to hunt.  <br />
