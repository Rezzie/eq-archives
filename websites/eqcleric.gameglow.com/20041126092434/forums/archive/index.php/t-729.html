<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badina</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is simply an idea taking a counterpoint from Brodders post of 'whats the next battle for clerics'.  I myself was unconvinced that Brodders ideas should be pressed before Verant. Thats not an insult to Brodder but just a statement that I disagree.<br />
<br />
One issue that I see incessantly now that our pet has been nerfed .. is the pet is delegated to the 'worthless' slot.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not sure I've ever seen a class stand together on an issue like this. (Maybe mages with some of their worthless summons is relatively close) but if we can as a majority agree that our pet IS worthless .. then...<br />
<br />
Lets not ask for it to be changed, lets ask for it to be REMOVED.<br />
<br />
Think about it for a minute. The whole cleric community saying &quot;look this spell is just crap, just take it out. Its taking room in my spellbook that I would rather have blank, thanks for the slap in the face but no thanks&quot;<br />
<br />
Quite an interesting thought to shove back in the game desingers face the fact they threw us a peice of candy that the majority of clerics have expressed is sour to the point of not being worth having at all.<br />
<br />
Every other class petitions for CHANGE .. they want it to be better. Why not realize that we know they don't want us to really have a pet, and let them know that we realize it. Throw it back in their face (relatively politely of course). <br />
<br />
I mean comon? The pet dies in one round if hit, dies if it doesnt agro fast enough, dies at the end of the combat and costs an attrociuos amount of mana for what it does!<br />
<br />
Thanks but no thanks Verant. <br />
<br />
Don't do us any 'favors'. People are going to use this 'pet' as an argument against clerics some day I warrant and the fact is it is entirely unworthy of it. Why even have it on our list if all it is good for is some other class to use as a class balance argument against us?<br />
<br />
Now I anticipate this idea will be to confontrational, too argumentative, to negative for the crowd here. If the idea is not accepted (as I honestly don't think it will be) perhaps at least let it awaken new thought trains on ways clerical issues can be addressed to Verant. Not every issue needs to be addressed in the form of 'upgrade this, upgrade that'.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

<br />
Making a statement is exactly the whole point  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Err and the one other point is that this worthless pet can possibly be used as a class balance argument against us at some point.<br />

I can't see how anyone using it as an argument, I think everyone knows how useless it is.  Kind of like us saying &quot;That rogue lockpick skill is unbalancing!&quot;(well, ignoring the proposed rogue-only doors)<br />
<br />
I think Im one of the &quot;Making noise puts us on Verant's radar for nerfs&quot; clerics, and you are in the &quot;Squeaky wheel gets the oil&quot; camp.  Nothing wrong with either, we just have to agree to disagree.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
And while your at it see if you can get them to do something with &quot;wave of fear&quot; - I personally like this spell but I have never had a need or seen it used beyond starting trains in unrest or Mistmore.<br />

Helps keep them from casting spells, and if they're unstunned for long enough to cast it'll most likely be at the pet. While they do that you nuke 'em. =\Probably a PVP Server spell most likely...Like blind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if we included at least one (if not both) lines of AoE spells, this could send a message.<br />
<br />
Just ask them to completely remove these 99.99% useless spells. Heck, give us a utility spell or something. I'd trade every one of them for something as silly as Levitate.<br />
<br />
(After all, if ANY class should be able to walk on water, it should be us...)<br />

It would make more sense to me to try to get something changed along the lines of increase Dodge skill as opposed to trying to get them to get rid of a spell.  Who cares if it occupies a slot in your book?  Is your book so full that the one extra space would make a difference?  I think not.  Unless you have some extra stuff in your book that the rest of us don't I can't see how having the spell could hurt.  Who knows what kinda cooky ideas Verant might have in the future.<br />
<br />
Maybe 3 months from now, they will implement something that will actually make our pet worthwhile (seriously doubt this but still) and if we protest the spell and they remove it, then obviously we are the losers in the end.<br />
<br />
I say leave things as they are for now.<br />

Actually Wave of Fear can be a very useful spell in emergency situations. If you are in an Evac situation and the Druid or Wizard is having trouble getting mana or is getting hit, a well placed Wave of Fear can buy them and the group a bit of time to get out of Dodge. This has saved my group several times. Though it may not be worth the spell slot in most situations it does creep into my memmed list when I am in an all AE group pulling huge trains on purpose.<br />
