Should we bother going over there or just stick to Unrest and the usual regular spots back in the old world?<br />

The exp here is just incredible!  Last night I played for under 4 hours and got 3 bubbles of exp!!  Just two more bubbles to 29! WAHOO!!  If you bring a friend, life is really easy fighting the skels because they do not assist.  Most of the bugs and plants conned blue to me when I was 26 and gave good exp also without assisting each other.  The only things that were KOS to me (dwarven cleric) were the frogs and the exiled iksar.  I have gone from 26 to almost 29 here in a week.  Hope this helps...<br />

I was in a Sarnak group at the Ledge in the Fort, and I was making around 1 bub XP an hour.  And you can get expensive items (rare) from the LEGOs in there.  Plus it is not uncommon for a MOB to drop 2pp.  <br />
