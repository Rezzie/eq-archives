<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sachiiel</div><div class="date">02-08-2000, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Believe it or not, I am still in Highpass Keep at 35.  I have found that it is the safest place to get exp and you sure as hell don't want to die in 35.  Plus being the top member in the group, you tend to get a good cut of the exp.  SolB was a bit dangerous, unless you were in the priest room.  Grouping with the really high levels there, ex. 49 cleric, kills the exp.  I will trudge through 35 in the keep and check the exp at 36 before moving on.  After that I am thinking about soloing specs...<br />
<br />
It's a boring life, but at least I know I will never lose exp down there due to a death.  What pisses me off is the new upstarts in there since I have hit 35 are like, &quot;You are too high...&quot;  That is bull**** because when I first came to the Keep at 24, there was ALWAYS 2 37+ druids down there.  Socarri and Tymir.  I think they left at 39.  And now I am getting refused at 35 in the Raider room?  Bull****.<br />

No complaints about me being the highest, I had 35th Paladins, a 35th monk and a 35th magician with me in that sitting.<br />
<br />
I quit the group when I hit 37th - too many green things, and I was thinking it was getting really unfair in the XP sharing.<br />
