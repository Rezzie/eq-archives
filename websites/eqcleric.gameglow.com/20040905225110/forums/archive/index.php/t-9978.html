<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambul Ants</div><div class="date">04-01-2002, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if it a good title for my rant but seemed as good as any.  I was hunting in Skyfire with friends and when we were done I headed back to FV. Took the OT FM LOIO route.<br />
I just zoned into LOIO when I get a tell &quot;Can you res us at the Giant Fort please&quot;<br />
<br />
I pride myself on being helpfull so I said sure. I zone back in and head to the fort.  Along the way I latch onto a Brundi(sp) miner which I fear and keep going.  I get to the fort and look for the boddies. All gone!<br />
<br />
I ask the person who wanted the res and get told that the pally in the group beside them resed.  I cast 90% exp res pally 35% I think. I took less than 4 minuite to get there, and I don't charge for resses.  <br />
<br />
I'm standing there a little mad, when the Brundi miner finds me and starts wacking me from behind.  The group that called me starts pulling giants and leaves me there.<br />
<br />
I didn't die, and my no res for you book got three names longer.  I just hate when a game makes me think about writing in a rant form.  <br />
<br />
Ok I'm done.</div></div><hr />

My pally can do our a pally 39 rez (forgot what %) and get rude tells well fine if you cant do it. My cleric gets the same reaction also. They wonder why my alts wont group with them then I send a copy of the logged text to him.<br />
