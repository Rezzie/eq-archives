<br />
We were fighting the Dain and had him below 10% health with only one death and clerics on average at 50% mana - when the Coldain war was lost in GD which instantly poofed the Dain for us. <br />
<br />
I dont blame the guilds that were doing the war though I got the impression they would hold off until we were done (probably miscommunications though) - but it surely was frustrating - even moreso as this would have been the first Dain kill on our server.<br />

<br />
Pathing in Icewell is piss poor at best.  Dain poofing is a regular experience till you get it down.   For instance on my server a guild besides mine recently started killing Dain.  They have successfully poofed 4 of the 5 dains they have attempted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cadinos</div><div class="date">06-24-2001, 01:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">we pooofed him 2 out 4 times smegal. there any other guild you are talking about. not that your guild didnt poof him at the beginning, or? hehe. whatever not in mood of ranting today. pathing blows bad there :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, this is not a bug, but a design feature. You were meant to fight the Dain in his throne room/bedroom, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Getting him down into the pit is the player trying to get the Dain's &quot;I must get to the person who has angered me&quot; impulse to override his &quot;I ain't going down there!&quot; impulse.<br />
<br />
If you don't do it just right, he poofs!<br />

Quite literally a pro-Dorf alliance lost the Coldain War (10th Ring) on the 3rd giant wave.  After such, all of ThrugA/ThrugB repops and spawns &quot;dead&quot; guards, etc.<br />
<br />
Dain was being seriously owned when all-of-the-sudden, Dain, mage pets, and every other NPC in the zone depop'd because the War in GD was lost.<br />
<br />
This was not really anyone's fault;  it's just a frustrating side-effect of Verant's new move to make the game more dynamic (which I encourage whole-heartedly).<br />
<br />
The good news is the very next day, we killed Dain  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif   A first for Tribunal and a very relieving experience given the previous days frustrations!<br />

Reread my first post - your reply indicates you only read half of it - a crime I have been guilty of at times too I admit.<br />
