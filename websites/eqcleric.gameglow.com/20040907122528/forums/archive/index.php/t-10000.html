Mostly because now that I have revive the res requests are trickling in and I know once I hit 39 it'll be &quot;res me&quot; hell most likelky so I might pick up some pointers here with setting them straight  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Hehe me too.. its funny  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I haven't had any really bad rez experiences..since I've only had Revive for 7 levels. But if you read my post in the 'People that won't take no for an answer' thread.. you'll read the one and only rez request I've ever denied  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

But the only bad experience I can remember was when I was running through North Karana on my way to Rathe Mts to farm Hill Giant money, when I was asked to come rez 2 people in Permafrost for 200pp. I figured I could do that since I was out trying to raise money anyway.<br />
The whole time I was running through NK, WK, Qeynos Hills, then Blackburrow, I was keeping in touch with these people - finding out how they died, their level, just making sure they knew I was still coming. So here's the kicker - I get to Blackburrow, and I ask them some other non-essential question, and I get &quot;oh some other cleric just rezzed us.&quot;<br />
I was nice enough to agree to run almost 6 zones, and keep in touch to let them know I was coming, but they werent nice enough to wait for me - making me run 3 zones for nothing?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozymandia</div><div class="date">11-30-2001, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This all worked out in the end but made me feel pretty crappy for a while ..<br />
<br />
In Sol B.  My 57 warrior friend and I (newly dinged 40) were killing kobolds and bats, trying to get me a level buffer.<br />
<br />
I'm at the zone-in while he runs around smiting dogs mightily.  I get a tell:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, could you please spare a revive at the pool room?&quot;<br />
<br />
I say I'd be happy to revive, but I'm not familiar with the zone ~ if he'd drag it to me, I'd be happy to.<br />
<br />
He pulls the body to me, and I take a look.  Now, I'd seen this dead person about 15 minutes before this do /ooc Sorry!!  right before a train of kobolds smashed me flat.  I'd seen an iksar monk run by right before; this corpse was an iksar monk, same name.  I said:<br />
<br />
/say &quot;Hmm this is the guy who trained me earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, being the nice loving cleric that I am, I sent a tell to the dead person and said &quot;Revive incoming,&quot; and revived him, since revive is what was asked for.  The person standing there who had brought the body said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Revive?  Can't you rez?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you said revive.  Ok, meming rez, one sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sat down to mem my rez, when I hear the revived monk say &quot;REVIVE?&quot;<br />
<br />
So for the next hour I hear in /ooc all about how I'm a crappy cleric who would only revive someone because I thought they had trained me, and that I had allegedly told the first guy that a revive was all I would give because I was trained.  I was slightly miffed.  Never mind that I had TOLD him it was a revive that was incoming, and that he had clicked &quot;Yes&quot; to a revive; he insisted I had maliciously cost him 2 bubs of exp at level 54.<br />
<br />
However, after sending a /tell finally to the revived monk, we worked out that his guildmate had asked for the wrong spell unintentionally, and that he had misunderstood me.  I'm not sure how, but he did.  Anyway, that's my worst rez story, and I felt like crap for quite a while that night.  Ah well, such is my life /grin<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amojoman</div><div class="date">11-30-2001, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My worst res request happened when I zoned into Feerrott to pick up my roommate's enchanter to get him to help with the 9th ring quest in Great Divide.  <br />
<br />
Had just ported into Feerrott when I got a request for help.  I responded that I wasn't able to help.  Since my roommate was already at the Feerrott druid ring, it took less than 30 seconds to pick him up and port back to Great Divide.  Upon zoning back into Great Divide, I get a tell from the same guy saying, &quot;Well you're not in the same zone anymore.&quot;  followed immediately with &quot;THANKS FOR THE HELP A**&quot; (astericks weren't there in the tell).  I got another nasty tell from him which involved 4 letter words.  Out of anger I told him to piss off and then put him on /ignore.  <br />
<br />
The next day I happened to be ressing one of his guild officer's group in Eastern Wastes and talked to him about the conversation I had with the guy.  The guy was either /guildremoved or left on his own, but a week later when I ran into the guy again, he was guildless.<br />
<br />
My biggest pet peeve of all was being told by my group, &quot;We don't want your res because you're only 54.  We're going to wait until a 56+ Cleric zones in&quot;  I left the group, ressed myself and haven't returned to the zone as of yet.  Currently 57 and have had the pleasure of turning down res requests from 3 of the 5 that were in that group.<br />

<br />
My worst res request was when I dinged 29.  It had taken me 45 minutes to get a port out of Ill Omen simply because my cleric is a high elf and even sow'd runs very slowly.  Any agro from the drachnids and she'd be toast.<br />
<br />
Anyway I finally got a port and an instant before LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... I receive a tell something like &quot;could you res me pls&quot;.  I couldn't even get a reply in before zoning so as soon as I zoned, I replied and our conversation went something like this:<br />
<br />
Me:  I'm sorry, I was being ported out when I received your message.<br />
Him: I don't know why you play a cleric, you suck!<br />
Me:  Excuse me?  I haven't even bought the spell yet you jerk.<br />
Him:  Whatever<br />
/ignore him<br />
<br />

I'm running through NFreeport to the bank to, well, bank. Then I'm heading to SolB for some adventuring. I'm bound in Kael for a variety of reasons and I'm not changing the bind point anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I get a tell from someone asking if I'll come out to OoT adn rez them. I respond that I'm banking and running to SolB and that I don't want to go spend an hour riding the boat, so no thanks.<br />
<br />
I get a tell back saying &quot;I'll pay you 20p.&quot;<br />
<br />
I told the guild about it and we had a good long laugh.<br />
<br />
My response was basically &quot;um, in SolB I will make 100p in an hour, not to mention a good amount of xp. You're asking me to give that up for the joy of being bored on a boat for an hour and 20p? don't think so  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif&quot;<br />
<br />
I then got spammed with a few well choosen words about how I was a lousy cleric.<br />

They dragged the body to the Safe Side (SS) and then someone takes the train to that side.  I think I spent an hour and half rezzing with bard song and a necro feeding me.  Hehe I didn't even request donations - think we did 14 rezzes that night.<br />

I understand what you're saying, since I play non-cleric PCs as well.  My characters die without getting resurrected more often than I want to admit.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
But... losing some experience and time because I died is NOWHERE near as bad as having my time wasted by &quot;people&quot; (term is used advisedly) who are absolutely convinced that their time is more valuable than mine, harrass me if I do not subject myself to their every whim, and do not even express appreciation if I do help them.</div></div><hr />

My main is a druid.  Do you even want to think about the tells for SoW, ports, buffs, items, and powerleveling, many of them quite rude, that I receive every day?  I know very well what it means to have unreasonable demands made on your time by inconsiderate people who are too lazy to get to a druid ring, or aren't ready for a port when you get there.  <br />
<br />
Powerleveling?  Why sure, I have a spare week with nothing better to do than powerlevel you.  What else could I possibly be doing?  Oh, yes.  I could be waiting for that person I agreed to port fifteen mintues ago to finish his banking four zones away so I can port him!  <br />
<br />
FYI:  I don't charge for ports, but sometimes I do take people up on their offer if they're shouting a price to the zone.  Not sure where people come up with this idea that druids have lots of items to hand out.  I may not have the cost of peridots to bear, but I also almost never have more than 500pp to my name and quite mediocre gear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chukoliang</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, I don't know if it seems horrible to you but I will tell you what I feel was the personal worst rez experience, I had.<br />
<br />
I have had the tells from across the world. I have had people begging for rez's. I have even had people telling me I was a jerk and more,because I didn't travel 6 zones to rez some total stranger. I have had totally twinked out guys with super items who don't give me a dime for the rez. And of course what I usually get is a thank you , I don't require a donation,but when your as poor as I am, it sure helps. Even a buff is good  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
But my worst experience was when I had just died in burning woods hunting wasps with a druid friend and , I was bound in the Dreadlands. As I was going across a guy from my guild whom I barely knew was asking for a rez. I asked him where his body was and he proceeded to argue with me that I was not high enough level to rez him the 90% rez with my level 51 cleric. <br />
<br />
Ignoring that I told him I could and found out his body was some where in FV. I zoned over and ran there, not having an invis and barely having a sow , I ran near the city where he told me the body would be. I then messaged him and he told me it was along the river bank heading away from the zone to the lake of Ill omen. Not being terribly familar with the area and a little bit worried, because even the green mobs there seemed able to kick my butt, I went on the hunt for my guildies body. <br />
<br />
I continued the search with the /corpse button along the area he said his body was, it took me about 30 minutes to figure out that this guy knew the zone less then I did. I was already into the quest to resurrect him so I was determined to get him. I msged the guild , no one would respond to help this person. I was shocked no one would come help the cleric, who had rezzed their arses and healed them. But I continued to search.<br />
<br />
Then I was struck down by one of these green mobs and killed. I then went back to my bind point and had to make my way back to the FV zone with no items on me. I was running to the zone and I got lagged out by the trees (which often happens to me) and I was killed.<br />
<br />
 I had to find a friendly bard with nothing to do to point me to my body. She did and I followed her. She showed me to my body in time for me to get beat on and killed by another mob. Fortunately the kind bardess came to my rescue and brought my two bodies to me to be rezzed at the KC zone. After the rez an enchanter I am in the habit of trading spells with, you know I buff him and he gives me clarity, fixed me up with clarity and invis while his druid friend in his group gave me a sow.<br />
<br />
I was now invis and sowed so I ran to the fv zone and using the /loc command which I always hit when something starts beating on me I was able to find my body. About 300 feet away in game terms I found the body of the guild mate, I dragged both bodies back to the bridge near fv where the guards were, getting my head beat in dragging it there, but being saved by the guard.<br />
<br />
Both bodies were safe, so now I contacted the other person and he was afk so I rezzed myself. Then I rezed him. After I rezzed him, he msged the guild that he had gotten lvl 54 back and without out a thank you, or do you need a sow (he was a ranger), or a pretended offer for a donation, or not even a thank you for your help guild brother, he camped. <br />
<br />
I was a little disgruntled, and then went to the bank in F.V. and got me a sow potion and invis potion and then had made it back to where my body was in the Burning Woods, I rezed myself and had lost some exp, because I had died once on my own ,but 3 times in helping my guild mate. It was late at night so I camped.<br />
<br />
I logged out and came back on to have a message from a guildy asking me why I was a jerk and didn't rez the named person from the night before. Of course I was very confused and talked to the guildy and then found out that the named person quit because no one in the guild had helped him. He mentioned my name and the person messaging me assumed it was me who didn't help. However, it was soon realized that I was the only one who helped the person.<br />
<br />
This was all for naught though because , later I went on a Vox raid, we killed vox and the gm's shortly after respawned it, and this lead to confusion that extended a rift between some persons and the guild lost most of it's higher level persons, while I just followed a friend of mine, who left and went to another guild. <br />
<br />
I would have to say thats my worst rez experience, because it lead to my most deaths and the strangest reprecussions afterwards.<br />
<br />
But i'm sure there are many clerics with worse rez experiences out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taishar Malkier</div><div class="date">12-12-2001, 10:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm....as a matter of principle, unless i know them, they are in zone, or they offer a lot of bling bling i refuse rez request straight out.<br />
<br />
My worst exp with ppl asking for rezes was this:<br />
<br />
&quot;Paying 5pp for 50% rez, 10pp for 90% rez, 20pp for 96% 5 zones away&quot;<br />
<br />
Leveling to 56 on a cleric, w0w its worth it so i can get a whole 20pp for a rez.  It's an insult.  Free would be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulweaver</div><div class="date">12-13-2001, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My worst and also my best res experience was in hate.<br />
<br />
I dont know why but I always make my break in, I have never once in all my 53 levels failed to make it to SS. Anyway my guild did its first solo hate raid way back in the mists of time, and I did break in and got to SS. However bar one feigned monk I was the only player to actually make it to SS. Shortly after the monk died too. So it was me alone, and being a poor guild back then we had very few hate stones. So I decided to do some CR myself  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gifAfter dragging several corpses to SS and preparing to res, someone logged from another guild logged in and trained me and my recently res'ed bard.<br />
<br />
Splat. Dead, so now its naked break in to hate, nothing but a summoned hammer and 10copper on me, *zoop* last hate stone gone, tension is very very high ;D Once more I was the only one to make it and began the task of recovering more corpses and ressing. I got trained again but luckily I had ressed enough to handle it and we made it. The ressing some 25 corpses really sucked, but the buzz of doing the intitial lone CR in a fully stacked hate, with no FD or even invis was intense.<br />
<br />
Another bad one was someone who asked me to run from WC to CT to res him. Now I find it hard to say no to ppl, and after 5 minutes of me saying I couldnt really do it, I buckled to the harrassment and my cleric nature took over. I almost never charge for ressing. However I like ppl to offer (so I can say no anyway). If however I run many zones I will never turn down a donation.<br />
<br />
So Im offered 100pp which I feel is more a token payment as I say its not the money its the principal of the thing.<br />
<br />
I run to CT, no sow or jboots, took me about 20 or 30 mins if I remember right and when I arrive it turns out they need a CR too. So I CR their corpses from the underground part solo, place with all the walk ways, and res not 1 but 3 of them, by now my time is getting well over an hour wasted. They all say how great I am etc, but once ressed they just went silent and all 3 of them logged, not even 1cp offered. I was quite peturbed that someone could be so dishonest and abuse someones kind nature like that, promising donations but making non. <br />
<br />
However I wasnt that kind, they conned the wrong guy, being a guildleader I could ensure they never got a res from my guild ever again  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gifand a few of our alliances heard about them too  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif What goes around comes around......<br />
<br />
Muahahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolgor</div><div class="date">12-14-2001, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Refferring to the person who said they mostly play a non-cleric and sometimes go without any res... I cannot recall a single time when I died with one of my non-cleric alts and looked for a res. With my non-cleric alts I eat xp deaths for breakfast. I know what its like to be dragged out of a group and across 3 zones to do a res, and I never want to put anyone thru that. XP can be hunted if lost. An hour of running zoning and ressing can never be returned.<br />
<br />
Personally as much as i hate doing those out of the way resses, I try to do them as often as possible. Alot of cleric I know go /roleplay or /anon to avoid being botherred. Since I was 30, I have never hidden my cleric tag except by acident once or twice. I made all those levels to be able to do resses, and now that I'm 56... rezzing is what defines my class.<br />
<br />
Sometimes people are ungrateful and I don't get a donation or a get the infamous, 12pp 48gp 100sp and a &quot;Sorry, thats all I got&quot; to which I cancel the trade and let them keep it. When people &quot;forget&quot; to donate I ask them if they were planning to, and if they say they didn't then I just remember not to res them next time. <br />
<br />
On the other hand there are some donations I've got for doing resses I'd never want to have missed. I got a Crystalline Eye, 2 forest loops, 2 diamonds, 4 spells, and how many hundreds of plat I couldn't count. When some people profusely thank me for a res, I just answer with, &quot;Its my job.&quot; <br />
<br />
And it is... but you have to remember,<br />
<br />
Its a job I expect to be paid to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numinata</div><div class="date">12-17-2001, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my worst res experience happened a while back and hasn't been repeated since, thank Brell.<br />
<br />
I have a time put aside, usually on two or three days out of a ten day playing stretch, when I do what I call &quot;res patrol&quot;.  During those days, I usually will play for six to eight hours doing nothing but running around to zones and offering free rezzes and buffs.<br />
<br />
Well, on one of those days, around 1am or so, I was running around in Warslik Woods trying to find a mouldering halfling's corpse when I recieved a tell, &quot;Hi. Could u plz rez me in the Hole? I died and lost 57. I can port u 2 Toxx and pay u money.&quot;  I did a /who and got 56 druid.  Polite enough request, even in d00dsp33k, and he wasn't /anon, so I said sure.  The distance didn't really matter, as my whole day was being devoted to charity, anyway.  At about that time, I finally found the halfling and ressed him.  I told the druid to meet me at Skyfire and I'd be there in a little bit.<br />
<br />
On the way, I ran into two ressees in OT who knew that that day was my charity day and they asked me to res.  I agreed, telling the druid I was having a bit of a hold-up.  While I was ressing the two at the ramp, druid boy starts getting impatient.  &quot;I say Id pay u. Why u rez others when I say I pay u??&quot;  I replied that his offer didn't make much of a difference, because I don't charge or accept donations when I'm on &quot;res patrol&quot;.  By then, I had finished with the two resses and was back on my way to the Skyfire zone. I got several &quot;R u coming yet?&quot;s, but opted to ignore them.  <br />
<br />
I bound at Skyfire/OT zone and proceeded to run along the wall toward the port spot. . .straight into the loving arms of a necro-led train of faeries and devourers.  All my buffs went bye-bye as I (stupidly) attempted to heal the necro.  We leapfrogged back to the SF/OT zone, with me running ahead and healing as he came slowly forward, dragging his train. The necro made it. . .I, sadly, did not.  Two devourers had Numi for lunch.<br />
<br />
There I am, repopped at zone and medding for my res when I get the tell, &quot;R u coming yet??&quot;  I inform the druid that I was killed, myself, and am waiting to res my corpse.  He, being an entirely sympathetic person, tells me, &quot;WTF?  How u die here?  No one I know die in SF!&quot;  I tell him to please be patient and I'll be there shortly.  He agrees, with a polite &quot;. . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay! Res is done and I'm back on track!  I run back along the wall (keeping an eye out for necros, this time) and make it to the port area with no snags. He's waiting for me and we group up for the port. While he's casting it, I get this pearl of wisdom, &quot;Next time u run thru SF, make sure ur buffed.  Mabee then ull live.&quot;  I sigh and we port away.<br />
<br />
When we arrive in Toxxulia, he tells me, &quot;U go on. KOS in Paineel.  My corpse at is zone in Hole.&quot;  I opted not to mention that all good races are KOS in Paineel and disbanded.  I took off to the destination and arrived, unKOSed, at the Hole.<br />
<br />
When I entered, did a /who and saw that I was the only one there.  I started to swim for the shore and got a res request from an old guildmate who had died in SolB. I told her I'd be there as quickly as I could, and finished my swim to the shore.  When I hopped up. . .big surprise.  No druid corpse.  I sent him a tell asking where he had died.  He tells me, &quot;Near the big rock.&quot;  I asked him to clarify, hoping that they had added a big rock near zone-in since the last patch. Happy to oblige me, he answers, &quot;Near the big rock in front of tower.&quot;  I begin to cry.<br />
<br />
Now, let me say that I am certainly not one to turn down a challenge.  One of the reasons that I've been coddling this druid guy is that, with all of his rudeness, it's a challenge in itself.  But, running down and pulling his corpse is going to hurt.  I tell him I need a few minutes to think. He tells me, &quot;Hurry plz, I only have a few minutes left.&quot;  I swim outside to bind and recharge JBoots, then swim back in and begin to buff.  I ask the druid to consent me.  By the time I'm finished, my buff row looks like a canary.  I med until I'm at 70%, take a deep breath and RUN my widdle legs off.<br />
<br />
Amazingly, the train doesn't catch up to me until I'm at the rock itself and targeting his corpse.  But WOW, does it catch up to me.  I'm down to 3 bubs of health before I can get off my DA.  Toting my package back, I run for the zone.  In the main hall, my DA wears off and I'm down to 1 bub before I can DB.  By the time that wears off, however, I have zoned.  I tell him I have to wait for the train to return to its spawn spots and he tells me, &quot;U not have to train! Just sneak and ur gnome so wont get hurt.&quot; I make a mental note to ask him what neat drugs he's taking, then zone back in.<br />
<br />
Yaay! I've done it! Train is gone and corpse is at shore. I send him a tell asking if he's ready for a res (I always do this, afk experiences have taught me:P).  He tells me, &quot;WTF do u think???&quot; Brell gives me the patience not to mem revive, so I cast resurrection.  When he pops and I heal him, he stands and proceeds to open a trade window with 10pp in it.  I cancel it and tell him that I don't accept donations.  I begin to get spammed with the trade window.  He won't give up.  I finally acquiesce and take the damned 10pp. . .I can always spend it on a peridot, I think.  <br />
<br />
He is now medding and I have another res to do, so I humbly ask for a port to Lavastorm, as there is another in need.<br />
<br />
He tells me, &quot;Sure, for 10pp.&quot; I take a moment to walk away from the keyboard and bash my head against a hard object.  I return and say, &quot;Will you not just port me for free? I just went through an awful lot to help you.&quot;  He says, &quot;Yes, but u charge me for res. I charge u for port.&quot;  I say, &quot;Why are you being mean?&quot;  He stands up, gives me a rude gesture, and ports away.<br />
<br />
Luckily, my old guildmate had a druid who could do the port to Lava, so she wasn't in trouble.  I had plenty of time at the port circle to contemplate the idiots that roam Norrath.<br />

<br />
That druid sounds like a 100% jerk. The kind of person who every cleric should agree to never res. A shame there is no such thing as a server-no-res-list.<br />
<br />
But one thing surprices me. Why did you not ask him to come to you? He could have TP'ed to Skyfire and ran your direction when you were in WW. Would have cut a lot of your running time.<br />
I always do that when somebody are coming to pick me up for a res - let them do half the running.<br />

I say sure, that could save me time(I had been in EC but no one was available for port there so i decided to leg it hehe).<br />
<br />
Well we port over to DL and he starts running towards tunnel, and i ask where the corpse is, he says come to KC. hmm but i run after him to KC and he zones in.. now im beginning to suspect that he didnt tell me the whole story, he asks me to zone into KC which i do and when i zone in, he promptly ports over to EJ, WTF???? then he spills the beans that he has corpse in Kaesora(the druid was lvl 52 or 53) <br />
well since im stuck here now, i might as well get this over with, so we run to field of bone and zone into Kaesora, there the corpse is.<br />
well i rez him and wait for him to get mana for port and he then ports over to Ferrott.<br />
but in ferrot he says &quot;thx&quot; and disbands and runs away..........I was shocked, to say the least.  at this time i decided to put him on ignore and has always refused to join groups he is in.<br />

I'd say my worst res experience was in Velious.  I had just bought the expansion, and only had 64 (!) mb of Ram at the time, along with 8 (!!) mb of video Ram.  So you have some sense of what my lag was like walking through those zones, not to mention my zone times.<br />
<br />
I'm at the Iceclad portal when I get two tells.  The first is asking me to &quot;kill something powerful so I can loot it pls pls PLS I need money&quot;.  /ignore idiot #1.  The next tell asked me to come to the GD to res someone who died, no mention of repayment but what the heck, I think.<br />
<br />
My trip across the EW can't really be described.  I knew in some primordial way that I had a train behind me, but due to the lag and the framerate, I really couldn't be sure.  Suffice to say I zoned with about 2 bubbles of health left.<br />
<br />
Finding the new corpse, I go to cast, and I get a &quot;Oh..nm. u only have n00b res I need 56 res&quot;.<br />
<br />
/ignore idiot #2.<br />
<br />
Gating back to Iceclad, within five minutes I get a tell from a group member of #2, asking me to please res him as they couldn't find a 56+ cleric anywhere.<br />

Me and my mage hubby were in Kedge trying to figure out how to get Undertow and killing things along the way.  Then I got a tell from a 52 ranger (whom I don't know) who wanted a rez for his guildmate.  I said no because I was low on mana, and we were medding for our next kills.  Then he would not stop harrassing me and continuously giving me tells after tells and even bringing the corpse to me just so I would rez the corpse.  I really hate people who don't give up.  Then he said to me it's just 300 mana to rez it doesn't cost much at all.  Well resurrection cost 700 mana and that's about a little bit under half of my mana bar and not including the heal.  I really didn't want to rez the corpse because we were medding for our next kills so my mana was precious to me at the time, and he was also just being really mean bothering me over and over again even when I told him no already.  Later on when he finally gave up, he called me a &quot;f***er&quot;.  The person who wanted a rez was standing there too when he called me a name, and she was an officer too of their guild.  She said absolutely nothing.  I'm glad I didn't rez this person, and their whole guild will be on my no rez list for this incident.  I feel that as a cleric I'm not obligated to rez people especially when I'm in a situation where I need my mana for something else.  I really feel that I have a right to say no.  I absolutely can not stand people who harrass me even though I already said no.</div></div><hr />

The group is understandably annoyed and I apologize profusely, especially considering they now have no healer and must reform.<br />

So we TP to NK and make the slow jog to Paw (no SoW or Jboots).  Finally zone in and there's the Mage and corpse. Cast res on the corpse....nothing happens..<br />
<br />
Me: &quot;ummmm Did you get the res message?&quot;<br />
<br />
Soandso &quot;Yea, but I just found a level 60 cleric to do it. They are on their way here now.  Sorry.&quot;<br />

This seems to have become progressively more common the older the game becomes.  I dont mean raiding, but when corpses get dropped at your feet with a 'can you rez so &amp; so?' or 'rez me pls' (wtf is that? dangerously close to an order...).  And you burn your mana or wave your stick and....thassit.  Feck all, not a single, simple thankyou.  They just loot up and wander off.<br />

<br />
I was 39, fighting in OT, and a guy yelled that he needed a rez BADLY, and would pay.  I was in a group at the time and I normally will not leave a group for a rez, but this guy yelled and yelled and yelled, and no one was responding (this should have been my first clue).  My group was doing fine, so I asked if they would mind me leaving to do the rez, and then wrote the guy and said I could do a 39 rez, was that sufficient?  He said &quot;YES, please!!&quot;  OK, everything's well and good so far.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
So I go and find the guy, and once again tell him it's only a 39 rez.  He says it's fine.  So I rez him in, and once he gets there he loots his stuff and says, &quot;Well, because it's a 39 rez I'm not going to pay you anything... I only pay for 49 and up.&quot;  I told him it doesn't matter to me because I don't charge, but you might want to tell other clerics ahead of time.  He says, &quot;Whatever&quot;.<br />
<br />
I told my boyfriend (who was also online at the time) what happened, and he wrote the guy and told him it was pretty crappy of him to not give me anything for my time.  The guy writes me back, and for the next half hour spouts off line after line of vulgarities, harassment, and anything else he could fit into a line of text.  I mean, I was nearly crying on my end with some of the stuff he was saying.  Then, he also wrote his friends and groupmembers and told them to write me and harass me as much as possible.  (I found this out because one of his groupmembers wrote me wanting to know what I did to make him so upset.  When I explained it to her, she disbanded from his group)<br />
<br />
I reported all his text, petitioned him, put him on /ignore, and never saw him online again.  Thank goodness.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
On Friday night, my guild raided Hate.  The plan was for them to go up at 8:30pm EST and to arrange for any latecomers to join and be ported up at 11:00 EST.  I live on the west coast, and don't get home from work in time to make the first run, so I had planned on getting home, making dinner, relaxing a little, and getting supplied with peridot, food, water, etc. for the raid before I went up.<br />
<br />
I got home, logged on, and my guild told me they needed me right away.  I got to the meeting spot and found that they'd wiped out and needed to get the clerics ported up to rezz.<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, it was a 6 hour CR.  I spent the majority of my evening camping out and/or getting killed.  Even with rezzes, I ended up losing over 2 yellows of xp that night.  It took so long that some of the people from the original wipeout didn't get rezzed, their timers expired.  We ended up having to port everyone back up to get their corpses.<br />
<br />
It wasn't pretty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was grouped with my usual partners, 55 chanter and 54 wizzie.  We were killing the vamps in the castle in TM on the balcony.  Due to assorted bad luck (like the mob grav fluxing us and aggroing the floor below) we had a large train and it took us a long time to deal with it. (about half an hour..well within the res timer) <br />
<br />
During the Big Train Wreck, I got a tell from a guildie who wanted a res in Akanon.  Now, I was really busy keeping the chanter alive and helping root mobs so he could mez them.  I did not have time for a lot of explaination.  So I told him I was fighting atm, and would get back to him.  <br />
<br />
I am sure i missed some of his tells, since the battle spam was fast and furious.  I kept trying to update him 'still fighting...' 'hold on..' etc.  I know, not too articulate, but you would think he would realize I was busy.  <br />
<br />
So as the fight is winding down, I am thinking ok, I can arrange for him to pick me up now, I get a really nasty tell from him that 'some cleric i dont even know came to res me.'<br />
<br />
To top this off he has the gall to be angry at me for not leaving my group (also guildies) to die to the train so i could go res him immediately. Here is a lovely quote from his resulting post:  I think it is a little inconsiderate to look at it from the point of &quot;well I have 3 hours&quot;, <br />
So let me get this straight, you think its not rude to put yourself before everyone else in norrath, including myself and my group?  Who also happen to be your guildies?  <br />
<br />
This guy left the guild over the issue.  At first I was upset, then my guildies made me realize it is his problem and not mine.  He is the one who thinks it is my duty to res him within 5 min of his death.  He is the one who was inconsiderate. I would have been happy to help him, once I was assured the battle was won and my group was safe. Now, he will always have to look for another cleric.  I sure do not intend to help him. <br />

<br />
I was in gfay watching the auctions and trying to offload some stuff.  I'm thinking I am going to log in maybe 20-30 minutes when I get a tell from someone asking me for help.<br />
<br />
I as usual ask &quot;wheres the corpse?&quot;  They tell me its in Skyshrine but they will compensate me for my time.  I'm bound in Cobalt Scar, so I tell them I'll gate over and meet them at the SS zone.  I meet up with the druid and she leads me through the maze that is SS.  (I've only been through it once and that was to get my CS key)<br />
<br />
So I'm sitting in what she has deemed a good place to drag the corpse.  There is a group sitting here waiting.  After about 20 minutes she ends up dragging an ogre's corpse to me to rez.  Apparently he was KoS to CoV and this was their way of getting him in.  <br />
<br />
I cast resurrection...and low and behold, the corpse is too old...its a dueled corpse so no 3 hour timer.<br />
<br />
So then I wait for the druid to port back and get the ogre to CS or WL again (forgot which) and they have the SK run over and kill him again.  So 15 minutes later, another corpse appears.  During this time one of the group members has drug one of their corpses to me and asked for a rez.  I of course rez them.  So finally I rez the ogre and he makes it in.  They then prepare to fight whatever it is that they needed to.  <br />
<br />
I ask them &quot;hey am I done here?&quot;  The druid then takes me a little ways off so that she can port me out.  All this time I'm thinking that I will get some compensation for all this waiting and 2 rezzes.  She ports me back to Butcher Block, and before I hit the ground, she has disbanded and gated back.<br />
<br />
No platinum, no trinket, no thank you.<br />
<br />
Not one of the people in the group thanked me or offered squat.<br />
<br />
The whole ordeal ended up lasting about an hour.<br />
<br />
About a week later I get a tell from the druid again asking for help.  I had the distinct pleasure of replying &quot;hell no.&quot;  She couldn't understand why I was upset.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cthulu</div><div class="date">02-14-2002, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok just so not all the stories are bad =)<br />
<br />
I had just started playing, when my wife wanted me to take her character to Qeynos (we were in Gfay, and only 1 account)(the character in question was an eighth level mage).  I researched a little, and begged for binds the whole way through (I knew I wasn't gonna get a TP, why try).  Got through Kith at 2AM, how I'll never know, now.  Got bound in Rivervale, got through HHP, which was very heavily camped at the time, was traveling down the ramp in EK, got to the first tower, and something was spawned in there!  It immediately aggros, stuns, and knocks me off the side.<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
Zone into kith, decide to cut that little corner of the zone, get aggroed by some kind of knight, think maybe I got lucky when he didn't immediately chase.  I apparently got just far enough away to not be able to see the casting he was doing.<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
Ride high on the wall in Kith, middle of the day (taking no chances), get through HHP, zone into EK, realize that the map on EQatlas is total crap, and start asking if anyone has seen my corpse.<br />
Immediately get 2 tells, I explain what I was doing when I died (the first time), get a tell back after about 2 minutes - &quot;don't move&quot;<br />
and I'm standing at my corpse, a 60 cleric standing over me, with a 60 mage right beside.  I say thanks, but that wasn't enough for them ).  They tell me that they have to buff me now, and that I need to empty out an inventory slot for the bag that the mage is gonna give me.<br />
<br />
remember - this is after playing the game for about 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
I'm soon buffed out the wazzoo, with a bag full of toys from the mage.  they even take the time to tell me the best ways to go through NK and WK.<br />
<br />
I made my cleric the next day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanbyen</div><div class="date">02-14-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The very worst CR/Resses ever for me.  Before level 60's level 50 was the max.   Fear was the target, 2 now non existant guilds make a try to break fear.   Mobs use to get bugged at the portal and slayed everyone in both guilds at zonin.  We didn't know this then.  Most logged into &quot;zoning please wait.&quot;  So they Call for assistance, I'm in the next groups.  10 groups, all level 45-50 zone in.  The ones that didn't go LD died to the bugged mobs.   4 more attempts were made, we had about 300 corpses in zone.   The only redeaming factor to this was, fear never used to repop after a patch for 12 hours.  <br />
<br />
We had a patch the next day.    <br />
<br />
The lamest ress I've had, was Hey i'll give you 100 plat to run over and ress me in XXX zone.  I'm one zone away and at a camp, I say I'm busy try to find another cleric.  2 hours later get another tell, no luck on a cleric could I bug you.  <br />
<br />
I am feeling bad for him, so I run over there, lost my camp in the process.   Ress him, he tells me he doesn't have the money on him, can I ress his other 2 corpses 3 more zones away at a portal/wizard TP for the money. <br />
<br />
WTF is wrong with people, do they think tricking clerics gets them somewhere?<br />
<br />
My favorite request was, I'm in sebilis D2, I get a request from a level 30 guy.  Could you ress me, I'm in hell level and I need help.  I say, &quot;where is that?&quot; He says,&quot; Rathe Mountains.&quot;   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I'm not anon obviously since he found me out of the blue with who all cleric.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Merridith_UK</div><div class="date">02-18-2002, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah the thread that never dies. My worst yet was when I was playing one of my other characters in Great Divide at one of the Kodiak caves in a pick up group, average level of the group is 35.<br />
<br />
A couple of people leave and we're down to four in the group, things get a bit rough and the tank runs for Velks, the bard stays behind doing crowd control when the rest of the group have already run, I follow the others. I'd told the bard to get out of the cave and above where there was a zone but either he was being valiant or he didnt know where the zone was and dies.<br />
<br />
I felt sorry for him so I'm spamming gsay asking him what happened, no reply for ages. We zone back out and he's in the zone and finally responds to me. I tell him not to loot all on his body and that I'll run my cleric down from Luclin to come res him and could the group save my spot.<br />
<br />
So I log and log in my cleric, level 52, not anon. Once I'm logged in I send the bard a tell, I'm on my way. As Im waiting for the portal to GD to activate I send the bard a tell and let him know how long until the portal goes off. When I arrive in GD I send him a third tell, I'm in the zone and will brt. This has taken around 15 minutes at this point. Now I get a reply 'Oh, what lvl res?'. I reply that it'll be a 49 res. 'Oh, u have ur epic?'. No, I reply. 'Well I got a guildie w epic comming to res'. I reply, You didnt think to tell me this?. 'I was zoning' he says. Bull! I think, he was in the zone when I logged off my other character and I've sent him three tells over 15 minutes. I sent you three tells since I logged on, you missed them all? I ask. No reply. So I /ooc to the zone that I hope my group is ok and that I'll be back with my other character shortly and sit and start to camp. 'What %res is 49?' He tells me. Too late, I reply.<br />
<br />
Gah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyfeara</div><div class="date">02-21-2002, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, after last night, decided to post about 2 of my experiences.<br />
<br />
1- Met this druid in GF while shopping.  We are just acquaintances, never group together, say hello once in a while.  I'm preparing with a group to go into CoM &amp; I get a tell from him asking if I can rez him in EJ.  Since I'm in EJ, I say sure, bring corpse to CoM zone.  He actually has 2 corpses.  About 15 min later the first one arrives.  He has trouble finding the 2nd one.  I tell him politely that I will rez the one that is here but my group is ready to head in &amp; I'm not going to keep them waiting.  Rez done.  A couple weeks/month later, he sends me another tell from one of his alts.  Please come rez this alt before my corpse poofs.  His alt was like lev 15 or something &amp; he was bound on another continent.  Unfortunately, I was already on the move with a group to our hunting spot.  I tell him I can't &amp; he goes off a major tyrade about how everyone uses his druid character &amp; refuses to help him.  Not once, have I ever received/asked for a port from this guy and being a 50+ druid, he should have gotten his alt bound a bit closer.<br />
<br />
2- Just happened last night.  Was hunting in Ten Mts with 2 friends.  We have a guild hunt in Nurga later in the week.  We wrap things up &amp; stop by in DL to drop off the ranger, then the druid &amp; I are porting elsewhere to do our banking, etc &amp; log for the evening.  No sooner do we land in DL, someone shoots me a tell asking me to rez him &amp; 2 or 3 others out near KC.  I tell him, I'm sorry I can't - I'm just passing thru.  He tells me it will take only 3 mins, etc.  I tell him again, sorry I can't.  We port away.  Then I get multiple tells from the guy about how when he's high enough he will make sure that no group in Seb or any other zone will take me - he knows my name now &amp; he has alts - then tell ME he's gonna put me on ignore.  Go figure - just a rude individual.<br />
<br />
People like this frustrate you when you go out of your way to rez on a pretty regular basis.  /shrug<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">02-21-2002, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this one stumped me last night.  I am not sure whether to laugh or cry.<br />
<br />
I was just coming out of Kaladim with new spells for hitting 49 when I get a tell from a guy who had to have used /who all clerics. He asks me if I could rez him and I ask him where he is.  He proceedes to tell me that he is in the Oasis but will have the group druid pick me up from the bbm druid circle.<br />
<br />
Well I am not doing anything in particular so I figure why not.  I head over to the bbm rings and wait for the druid whom it seems takes forever to mem the spell and get over here.  After the pick up we head to south Ro and then to the Oasis.<br />
<br />
We get to the guy and I ask where his corpse is.  He tells me it is in Cobalt Scar but don't worry he won't mind having to go back there when I rez him.  This confused me some and I ask him why he didn't tell me it was a lot further away then the Oasis when I asked him?  He proceeded to ask why it mattered, he is here standing in front of me who cares where his corpse is.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.<br />
<br />
Well first I explain that if I could just rez by clicking on your live body why didn't you come to bbm instead of sending a druid to pick me up and run me to you.  And that to rez I must click on the body.<br />
<br />
All to find out that this is a level 54 Paladin.  If what he said worked he could have clicked himself and rezed.<br />
<br />
Thankfully the guy was decently polite.  He stood there a second and I could just hear the brain a grinding.<br />
<br />
After another minute or so of inactivity I told him I was sorry that I couldn't do anything but was hoping I could get a tele back to bbm.  So there I was teleported back to bbm and just shacking my head in wonder about how any level 54 Paladin wouldn't know how to conduct a simple rez.  And secondly how a druid of at least porting level had no clue either.<br />
<br />
I just hope they bought the characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazarelle</div><div class="date">02-28-2002, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I died running through Kith one night.  I'm bound in WK.  I'm sitting at bride in WK and get sent a tell asking me to rez them at such and such a loc.  I'm not that great a locs, but I start out, looking for them.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the friend I was running with found someone to rez my own body in Kith.  I tell the person asking for a rez that I'm sorry, but I could not find them in time.<br />
<br />
I get rez'd, and the person asking for a rez starts harassing me about not giving them a rez.  I finally gate back to NK to rez him just to shut him up.  Went out of my way an hour just because I'm too nice.<br />
<br />
Turns out, this guy was in HK, and zones closer than I was to my desitnation.  He never even said thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drusk</div><div class="date">03-01-2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a side note.<br />
<br />
I think it is more impolite to leave your group to do a rez than it is to turn someone down for a rez.<br />
<br />
The only bad rez experiences I can remember are the one where I have to go a great distance only to get there and the person is already rezzed.  Yup, that torques me.<br />
<br />
And, if you turn down my level 49 rez once, it is turned down.  Don't ask me 15 minutes later.<br />
<br />
I usually accept donations for rezzes, but don't get upset if I don't get one.  If the rez was a pain, I would be angered for no donation, but I can't think of a time this happened.<br />
<br />
As for that druid in the hole, I would have never made it to Tox.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BadBoyCleric</div><div class="date">03-05-2002, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you about some of those guys are just complete idiots.  But I avoid all of that with a set of rules.  Some exceptions to rules will also be posted.<br />
I am 56th so I have the 96% rez finally and no epic.<br />
<br />
1) I *Never* leave my group to go rez someone<br />
   (exception of a guild member)<br />
<br />
2) If I'm on free time and they are in my guild or allianced to my guild they get priority rez. (I wont leave group to rez a member of a guild allianced to mine, they should have their own clerics)<br />
<br />
3) If it's a stranger I tell them I take donations but it isn't necessary.  I will only go up to 2-3 zones away from me. (I will not go through a dungeon for someone)<br />
<br />
4) I immediatly tell them they *MUST* have someone drag their body to zone-line or I will not rez them.<br />
<br />
5) Whenever someone starts getting upset and curses me, I immediatly take a screenshot of text and send it to their guild's officers and leader, I also IMMEDIATLY let my guild know so they will no longer help that guild until the issue is resolved.<br />
<br />
6) Sometimes I will take a day off and do rezzes for 100pp per body.  The rules to this method is they must port me there and back when done, someone must drag their corpse to zone-line.  Once again if they do not compensate you, repeat rule number 5.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps you.  I love being a cleric.  I have ABSOLUTELY no problems anymore.</div></div><hr />

Been 2 boxing for about 2 1/2 years, most ppl know i 2 box, i don't hide it.  My cleric gets a tell from a lvl 45 Mage in EW asking me for a rez. I'm in WW about to head into ToV.  I tell the mage i'm in WW not EW. About 2 seconds later WTF you where in EW not 10 seconds ago.  (Mind you i ran from Kael to WW)  I tell them i'm sorry can't do  it today.  My Warrior get's a tell (warrior is an officer in the guild) about how RUDE and MOUTHY my cleric is being about a rez request. After informing the mage that i'm the same person driving the Warrior as the cleric, and that the entire guild now knows what kinda person they are,  expect no rez for j00 statements ALOT.  <br />

 P.s  My cleric is my main  the Warrior is a twink.  Warrior doesn't nor will she get her epic swords.  ONLY, if they ever change RF, will one of my chars have there epics and that will be the cleric.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funno</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been playing a cleric for a while, and have formulated a few rules. Granted im a 60th lvl <br />
HALFLING cleric. (this point will become evident in a min). But, again some simple little rules of the road.<br />
<br />
setup:<br />
I hardly ever go /anon or /rol, needless to say i get ALOT of tells. When I get these tells I do a /who all #####, if they are anon, then i ask them to unanon for a min.<br />
I keep a legal pad and pen next to my computer.<br />
<br />
Rules:<br />
1) If you will not unanon, No rez for Joo.Period.<br />
<br />
2) if your below lvl 35, sorry. suck it up, it builds character.<br />
<br />
3) If I have to travel more than 2 zones, sorry, my widdle legs get tired. Sure RS3 helps, but still.<br />
<br />
4) if im in the same zone as them, then they have to drag it to me, WITHOUT training me. DA and DB are wonderful for leaving their dumb a$$ there to take the rest of the train.<br />
<br />
5) If they are a complete bonehead about me not helping them or give me grief in any form, I casualy write their name and guild name down on the afformentioned legal pad. <br />
<br />
6)if when i do the /who all, they come up on the &quot;list&quot; as its refered to. then No rez for Joo skippy.<br />
<br />
7) i NEVER charge. dont even accept a donation. It is only mana, and time. but If they fit into my rules, then it doesnt really take that long. <br />
<br />
8) i forgot what eight was for...<br />
<br />
9) if im in a group, rule 3 is voided, i wont leave, unless I know them, and they are a pretty decent person.<br />
<br />
10) If they have EVER run up to me and asked for a sow or port before, they go onto the list. jk...I explain to them, that even though im a Halfling, im a cleric..and not all halflings with maces or sticks are druids. If they give me a hard time, They then go on the list. <br />
<br />
11) anyone who drags a corpse up and drops it at my feet from outta the blue. and then has the gall to say rez now, goes on the list. and promptly gets ignored. <br />
<br />
12) if they threaten me in anyway, they get on the list. cause, lets face it, a cleric is ALWAYS gonna get a group. it might take some time, but we are always welcome in a group. Its only a game, get over it. <br />
<br />
13) unlucky 13- ok i gotta throw this in, if VI every gets it in their heads that maybe SF wasnt the BEST place to put ragefire, i might break down and finnish my epic. yes thats right, i do NOT have my epic.<br />
<br />
14) if in my journeys, i come across an unfortunate fellow's corpse, i will check the rez timer, and then check to see if said person is online. if they are, i send them a tell, saying hey, you need a rez. if they say yes, then Rez inc, if not, or no response, then i go on my merry way. <br />
<br />
15) All of the above rules can be tossed out the window, if i get the feeling they are in a bad way. or just to be nice. I have gone overland 3 contenants before to rez ppl, just cause they were having a bad time of it. see, im not a complete bastard.<br />
<br />
I was using my /friends list for the spamheads who used to annoy me, but i find a list with a little jot of what they did to get onto the list works much better.<br />

And these people usually never accepts the 'I'm grouped' excuse.<br />
<br />
Also guildies should use more of the '/who all cleric' option then just begging like a child over guild chat for rezzes when there are 10 clerics closer that might be able to rez.<br />
<br />
I agree with ya Aunoa, people take rezzing clerics for granted and this is a reason for many burned out clerics in EQ.</div></div><hr />

I was in Unrest, with the brand spankin new level 14 Reanimate still wet in my spellbook. <br />
Person comes up to me, &quot;Can you rez my groupmate, he's bound in Freeport.&quot; Close to proper grammar, bonus points.<br />
&quot;Sure, drag him over here. Its only the level 14 reanimate, is that okay?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I can donate.&quot; <br />
Mem new spell, click on poor unfortunate's body, cast spell. <br />

&quot;Haven't you ever cast this before?&quot; <br />
&quot;No... First time.&quot;<br />
Ah, he pops up, ta-dah! Heal said ex-dead person.<br />

&quot;Nah. Keep it.&quot; <br />

<br />
Mind you I was lvl 31ish had lvl 29 rezz (with the 35%exp regain.)  <br />
<br />
Was running though LOIO heading to FV (to bank, sell, and buy some stones for my symbol) and get a tell from someone asking for rezz at Sarnak fort and offering to pay me 10pp for it (I don't ask for donations but if offered I will accept, and sometimes will cancel the trade just depends on my mood and how much trouble the rezz is,) I said sure (I wasnt doing anything anyway.)  I ran over to the fort expecting to see his group there, to help me from getting destroyed by the sarnaks.  I get there and no one was at the fort (he was soloing inside) except 20 or 30 sarnaks (5 or 6 of which was guarding the entrance.)  I create a plan to run in to grab his corpse drag it out run to zone to break agro then go back to rezz him.  I ask him to consent me, and he asks &quot;what for?&quot;  I told him I can rezz him outside of fort where there is a little safety or inside, where I will get front row seats to see you die again, he consented me.  Anyway, everything works according to my plan.  I zone into FM then back run over and rezz him.  He pops grabs his stuff and runs (no PP for me, I said oh well and head on to FV.)  I get to the bank in FV and get a tell from the same guy asking for another rezz in the fort, because he couldn't find a group and decided to solo in the fort by himself again.  After asking he says &quot;I will pay you this time, I promise.&quot;  I send back &quot;fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.&quot;  He then asks what that means.  I laugh and put him on /ignore.<br />

<br />
So, someone shouts &quot;Looking for a res.&quot;  I tell this person that I can do a 50% res (just having reached 34.)  I wait a bit fort a reply, and soon he shouts again, this time: &quot;Looking for a high level res.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was really insulted and annoyed at that.  It was so... rude.  He could have at least replied &quot;No thanks&quot; or some such, instead of trivializing what I could do.<br />
<br />
He kept shouting constantly for a while.  finally I did a /who cleric, and I was the only cleric in the zone.  (Not surprising -- while there are always throngs of people in EC, it's not an incredibly high level zone where you get raiding parties.)  I told him something like &quot;You know, I am the only cleric in the zone.  You are wasting your time.&quot;  He stopped shouting after that.</div></div><hr />

I did one time get ported over to CS to res two druids who were kiting there, and while I wanted to do it for free, one of them did /split 300 on me (I was only grouped with one of them). Darn, couldn't return it - I arrived without cash - and besides, he disbanded then (after making sure I didn't need a port).<br />
<br />
My worst res experience was one that I made myself. Two actually.<br />
<br />
At level 49, I was running through Dreadlands, thinking with JBoots I was fast enough to outrun the Spiders before they would even agro. Ouch, I was wrong. Just past Karnors heading to FV, I managed to get 3 Spiders on my tail, freak out as I try to find the zone (tried rooting, but they broke too fast), and died. A Rogue helped me get my corpse, and after about 45 minutes I am finally back and loot up. Just as I get up from looting everything the Rogue tells me &quot;When are you going to res yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
The second one happened about 2 months ago. I was gathering for a Hate raid, and as usual people are duelling before groups are formed up and such. Somewhat annoyed I mem Revive, and bring the slain ones back. Anyway, groups form, we port up, some people die on the way in but most make it to camp. We had a few adds to deal with while doing resses. One who had died was a Cleric, a former guildmember who was 2-boxing with his Warrior at the same time. He asked me to res him, so sure, I do so. I see I have a res memmed (see the Hand Icon) and since we're up there doing resses, I blatantly assume without thinking, that it's the 90-res (I was level 54, no Epic yet). So I cast it, and my eye catches the line &quot;You begin casting Revive&quot; right as it finishes. So I immediatly yell over raid chat, into the zone and to his Warrior in a tell that he must NOT accept it ... people get confused, ask what's up and I see his Cleric appear ... 2,5 blue down the drain. I felt so bad and sure he was angry. He did accept my sincere apologies though, but - damn, that felt bad (even though he didn't see himself that it was a Revive).<br />
<br />
I never go /anon or /role, though I did used to do so during my early 40-ishes. I must say that the number of res requests is at an all-time low (relatively), and usually people are kind when they do call on me.<br />

<br />
I'm in Unrest the other night, merrily slaying undead with a really nice group. I'm not /anon or /role at the time and I get a tell asking me if I'll rez someone. Well, with our chanter and her breeze, I'm great on mana and I say, sure, drag the body over here and I'll give you a rez. (Mind, I'm only level 20) He says, I'll have to come get you and take you to the body. Huh? Um, no, if its not in Unrest, I'm not leaving my group. <br />
<br />
A few begging and pleading tells later, I say look, I'm in a group, and I'm not leaving them without a healer. Sorry, not in Unrest, no rez. Silence. Thinking no more of it, I go back to slaughtering skeletons... er, returning them to their eternal rest. Ten minutes later, another tell. Why won't you rez me? Explain again. Not in Unrest, no rez. But I died in Skyshrine. Huh? I don't even know where that is! Sorry, no. Take too long, I'm in a group.<br />
<br />
Then the nasty tells start. I reported them, due to content. My parents were married thank you and no, I am not of canine descent. First time I've used my ignore list. :/<br />
<br />
Someone tell me where Skyshrine is? I don't feel bad for not going, but I'm curious how he could die and not find a stinkin closer cleric. And why me? I'm only level 20. Isn't skyshrine a really high level zone?<br />

Yes, Skyfire is rather high level, my warrior hunted there in her mid 40s with guildies who were in their 50s.  It's also in Kunark.  On the plus side there is both a druid port and a wizzie port there -- the druid one is cool looking and reasonably safe, whilst the wizard one is apparently in the middle of a dragon highway, with no particular landmark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My Fennin Ro group had just wiped out in Mistmoore (Velma is 39); as I was scribing spells in Lesser Fay I got a tell.  &quot;You have the 50% rez right, can you do a rez?&quot;  Do a who, class is Wanderer (54? 55?), location Lesser Fay.  I replied &quot;Sure, just drag the corpse to the MM zone&quot;.  Response -- &quot;Is that Mistmoore?  Come rez me at the Greater Fay zone.&quot;  I answered, &quot;sorry, I'm grouped, naked and doing a CR in Mistmoore, you'll need to drag here.&quot;  The only reply &quot;Come here to rez -- I'll buff your group!&quot;.<br />
<br />
At that point I zoned into MM to start CR and never responded.  I felt bad, since at over 50 he had to be pretty desperate to want my rez in the first place, but I was absolutely boggled.  I'm 39, naked, and a class that can't cast invis, never mind sow.  He's over 50, can loot all but one item and thus be dressed, has sow AND invis, and wants me to go to him?!?

<br />
To set the scene, I work 3rd shift, so i'm up all night, even if I'm not at work.  This was WAY early on sunday morning, around 6amish.  Across our Alliance chat channel comes the phrase, &quot;Any clerics on?&quot;  I check the time, I got two hours before bed, and not many clerics on at that time, so, &quot;Sure, 60% rez here.  Where are you?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Lake Rathe&quot;.  Not a problem, even though I'm in Kith (small run in with a certain Dragoon in WC), I just got some SoW potions from a guildie for soloing.  Click and I'm off!<br />
<br />
After doing the normal run from WC to NK (getting lost in HHP, almost running off the ramp in EK due to boredom/lack of attention), I zone into SK.  I let him know I'm almost there.  No response, no biggie, he may just be busy getting the corpse to a rezzable spot.  Long run through SK, and find the zoneline (man, I hate that zoneline).<br />
<br />
You have entered Lake Rathetear.  /1 Ok, in Lake Rathe, near SK zone, where is the corpse?<br />
Dead silence.  Nothing.  Ok, no problem, maybe he's afk, better send a tell.  Hmm, that's curious, no AFK message, fine.  /time<br />
<br />
I note the time, and start sending the message every 3 minutes.  Still no response after 10 minutes, I was a bit on the upset side.  At 15 minutes I ask my guild how long I should wait.  They said 5 minutes tops, but what the hey, I've waited this long.  But next time I send the tell, I get the message back, such and such is not online.  <br />
<br />
Boy did I feel ticked.  And an allied guild member to boot.  *sigh* Ahh, well, live and learn, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

I am getting pretty bored with making javelins and most of the zones between Shadowhaven and Dawnshroud are safezones or otherwise low risk.<br />
<br />
I get to Dawnshroud Peak and see that the guy is in the zone.  I ask him to drag his corpse to the Netherbian lair zone and he asks me really nicely if I can come to the Maiden's Eye zone and rezz his corpse.  I protest at first because I have gotten hammered by mushrooms making that journey in the past but I finally relent and ride high on the wall until I get there.   The entire time I am in zone, there is someone shouting every 5-10 minutes or so asking if anyone has seen his corpse.  I get to the first guy's corpse and I see that he is a necromancer and he has looted all but one item on his corpse and has not been able to drag his corpse because he didn't want to lose his spot in a &quot;really great group&quot;.  I am a little pissed but I rezz him.  He gives me 10PP.  10 FREAKING PP!!!  Oh well, I didn't come here with the promise of anything at all so I guess I can't complain.  <br />
<br />
In the meantime the guy looking for his corpse asks me if I can rezz him when and if he finds his corpse.  I say &quot;sure&quot; and then I ask the necromancer that I just rezzed if he can summon corpse on the guy (who seemed to be at his wits end).  The necro says he is too busy and that his group needs him.  I remind him that I had just rezzed him and it would be nice if we could help some of the other needy players in the zone.  He then proceeds to remind me that he paid me for the rezz.  10 FREAKING PLAT!!!  His opinion was that my 50% rezz really isn't worth much more than that (despite the fact I was the highest level cleric on Luclin at the time).  So I offer to give him the 10 Plat back for the summon corpse.  He wants 100 Plat for it.  After all he has responsibilities to his group.  I say we can wait until he has regained his mana.  He still wants 100 Plat.  I don't know how much those coffins are but this guy seemed to be of the opinion that he was the only paying member of the EQ community.  He seemed to feel that I was only doing my job when I rezzed him but asking for a summon corpse was really putting him out.  WTF?</div></div><hr />

At lvl 52 (or so) I was running from EW to Kael when I got a tell from someone if I could res him in GD. Since I was in GD I said, sure, drag it to waterfall and I will do it. He said he got killed while running from the IC portal and had no time yet to rebind.<br />
I do a /who all dead_player01 and see a lvl 40 warrior in Highhold. Ok I can see his situation and asked him for the loc of his corpse, so i could drag him to the waterfall. He said that he didn't hit LOC, but that he got killed near the hill in the snow. hm.... snow and hills in GD.... I asked him where he ran through and found out he must have been killed between the wiz spire and the northern zoneline. I roamed the whole area, got attacked by wolfs and a giant and finally found his corpse. I dragged him to the waterfall (with the Kromriff army following me). Then I got a tell: Drag me to waterfall, Everhart, a lvl 60 cleric will res me. WTF??? I nearly risked my life and he just decides, that my res is not good enough for a lvl 40 warrior?? and the said cleric is too lazy to find the corpse himself?? I was pretty angry, dumped his corpse at the waterfall and zoned into Thurga where I made a /w all Everhart <br />

<br />
2. I zoned into Grieg's End with my group, where I saw a couple of bodies lying around. I do a /who all dead_player02 - it shows a lvl 40 warrior (again) in Dreadland. I sent him a tell if he needs a res. And he replied: what level res? <br />
<br />
Note: I rarely go /role and even if it was a lvl 49 res or even a lvl 39 - he could have been glad not to wait for the portal to open and to run through the zones... <br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
3. I was in Felwithe working on a quest and got a tell: can you res me? I answer, sure, drag it to me. He said, uhm.. I died in FV - I can port you. I said, sorry I can't, I am working on a quest here in Felwithe and FV is not just around the corner. He said: I will give you 50pp. I said: you better look for a cleric closer to FV. He: Common... I need that res lvl 35 (i think) is a helllevel<br />
Me: I am not coming He: but you have a res stick don't you? Me: yes I do, but still I am not travelling through x zones to res someone, when I have other things to do.. He:I need that res badly Me: /ignore dead_player03<br />

One night I was running to KC to duo with my monk husband.  There was a huge train as soon as I zoned in.  I ended up zoning out and then zoning back in.  I noticed several corpses scattered on the ground.  So being the nice person that I am, I began to click on them with epic.  I was a little pissed that out of the 7 rezzes that I did I only received 2 thank yous.  The rest of the 5 people just looted their corpses quietly not even thanking me for what I did.  I don't expect any payment, and I know that epic is manaless, but still I believe that I deserved at least a simple Thank you for taking the time to rez them.  So after this experienced, this sure taught me to rez corpses without them asking first.  All I can say is that there are a lot of ungrateful people out there, and I'm not going to rez corpses that I see anymore unless they ask me nicely.  <br />

<br />
Can't stand it when people considers the epic to be the same as no need to be polite cause you spend no mana, they still get 96% xp back and that can be quite a bit of time saved, at least a thank you to the cleric is in order, you did not have to rez them epic or not, when i play my necro and been given rezzes i always thank the cleric for it, being that i'm not very rich i can't afford to pay them, on the other hand i never ask for a rez either(or port or sow)<br />
<br />
And as for my comment on paying i been having like 50pp in the bank but finally managed to get over 2k, will get some peridots to give the cleric as a thank you(5 or 10 perhaps)<br />
<br />
I know this is a game but i still think being polite makes the game more fun for all.<br />

Since you may not be in zone or near enough to see the spell being case or the cleric has to leave the scene of the miracle, it is not always clear who to thank for the help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had entered Velious in Iceclad Ocean for the first time, heading to the dragon bridge when I got a tell from a druid needing some help. I followed the loc coordinates and low and behold when I arrived there, I found three people, all with trains.<br />
<br />
As it turns out, they were not looking for resses, but for someone they could pawn their trains onto so they could escape. I did not have sow on me at the time and being the happy go lucky cleric who loves to help people, I found myself getting beaten on, while two of the characters camped and the druid gated, or ported, leaving me to die.<br />
<br />
I was quite angry and my guild was very helpful in seeing that my frustration was calmed. They made a few wonderful comments to the druid that killed me. It turned out that I needed the res.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
On a separate note, how many of you have had experiences where you were about to die, only to be miraculously saved?<br />
<br />
I had an experience in Overthere where I was running to the zone with a train down to my last 10 hps. When I zoned, I found myself in the middle of Skyshrine (I believe) with two worms coming towards me. I had only 11 hit points and found somehow a way to get back to the zone and survived. That was tense! Never been in the zone before...<br />
<br />
Turns out there was a bug if you zone with less than 20 hit points or so you are teleported a short distance from the zone.<br />
<br />
ACK!<br />
<br />
I love reading these stories. The human factor is so funny. These silly humans. When will they realize that us Dwarves are way cooler?<br />

I'm playing my 'chanter main. I ding 56. I do my happy dance and head off to buy spells. (Buy spells before I ding? OMG, and jinx myself???) I get my spells and head to NK. I'm gonna find me some griffons to try this cool new DoT on!<br />
The Silver Griffon takes unkindly to my Tash and (long story short) sends me to wherever agnostic 'chanters go when they die. Un-ding.<br />
I'm insanely lucky. A buddy of mine (RL) logs on to an alt. I ask if he can rez. Sure, he says, after I get my alt's corpse out of SolA. I figure I've got some time to get some exp back at 55 before the 96% rez comes through. I grab a port for crack trade, hit OOT and find that the AC spawn is open. Easy exp, if a bit skimpy.<br />
Goblin ph. Cyclops ph. Cyclops ph. I send a tell to my friend: &quot;Any luck? I hate cr's in that dungeon.&quot; No reply. He's obviously busy. I shut up.<br />
Well, (again, long story short) luck strikes again. Yes, indeedy, friends and neighbors, the AC popped up right in my face. While I'm killing it, the cleric asks, &quot;Rdy?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;NONONONONOTYETWAIT&quot;<br />
Cleric: &quot;wtf?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;%t&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;%t&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;%t&quot;<br />
Cleric: OMG KILL IT<br />
Me: AM<br />
I see someone else casting. It's a pvp server, so I just KNOW it's a de wiz who's popped in to KS me. EEEEEK. Then the heal hits me. Doh...?<br />
The &quot;ks'er&quot; was a friendly lightie who healed me and my pet. Once I had the ring and buffed the cleric, my buddy rezzed me. Re-ding! YAY!!<br />
As always, I thanked him profusely. Payment would be redundant, as we constantly give each other peridots at need. Since I never leave home without a full stack, he always owes me. Once I sell the jboots MQ, I reckon I'll call it even.:p<br />

Someone trains goons (3 of them) and the goons pretty much killed everyone including me on sight..the person then had the gull to demand me giving him a rez and i was like heck no..didnt give any warning of impending train let alone that i lost a level which i managed to get back soon after since i had 50% rez i ende dup rezzing 6 ppl including me...the person argued that i had to rez because i was a cleric and it was my job and i told them it was not my job which i can choose to rez whom i want and when ever. being having bad experiences of ppl not thanking for rezzes nor paying when promised, so when i do charge i demand the plat up front before i waste me time. so the entire night i was in ot, the person kept saying on shout to not accept rezzes from me,  i started laughing since most ppl know i do rez if i can</div></div><hr />

If someone promises payment for a rez, when they arrive at the corpse, root them and summon corpse to yourself, saying you've been ripped off lately and want to make sure that you get paid.<br />
<br />
I'll try this on a friend, text comment included, and report back on how it works.  Trick is to drag the corpse far enough away from the PC to get it out of their summoning range before they unconsent you...<br />
<br />
What, can't a Dwarf be sneaky?</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about just running off with the corpse?  could probably get it at least a ways away before they think to un consent you from it?  I'd probably never do this except as fun with a RL friend who is used to my sense of humor, as a matter of fact, I'll probably do this tonight!<br />
<br />
One of my favorite stories is the following:<br />
<br />
After a PC begged me to rez for a donation (3 zones away), I travel to corpse, rezzed &amp; buffed him then sat down to med.  Then, this little d00d_01 said he didn't have anything to donate, but &quot;tks 4 rez&quot;.  This was a 47th Dwarven Warrior.<br />
<br />
I didn't make any reply, instead I sat and memmed cancel magic and stripped all his buffs and /ooc &quot;Everyone please take a moment to congratulate d00d_01 for becoming the first person on my &quot;No Free Beer&quot; list!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a classic moment and he got the point, I've never had another rez request from him again.</div></div><hr />

When I read your stories I couldn't believe them myself, thought you were exaggerating, but I scoff no more. Last night I got a tell from someone who was looking for a rez in Crystal Caverns, and he wondered why I wouldn't be willing to rez him since I was right next door in Permafrost (not to mention that I was down with a group exping in the pits). /who all noob_01 showed that he was a level 50+ ranger. WTH?! I had to try to kindly explain to him that Permafrost was at least a 30 minute walk from where he was, assuming I could get a port immediately upon zoning into SFG...<br />
<br />
I have learned some tips from this thread, though, which I have taken to heart, and which should serve me well in the future.</div></div><hr />

I was minding my own business in Plane of Mishcief, soloing the forest, killing Dinner every hour for cards, you know just minding my business (im a warrior not a cleric hehe) until the newest addition to PoM pops out and tries to kill me (yes, the pansy's /shiver). Well i know a trick of how to set off all the traps and camp out so im fine, i snicker and set off all the traps but right before I get to the safe spot, i go LD! Well i log back on after waiting 20 minutes for the 1018 error to go away to find that i was in the bazaar.... I had a necro friend that was camped there for that sometimes logged on for some exp and occasional rezzes but time was running short and my 3 hours where almost up. So... im about to shoot myself in the foot - I am screwed, as simple as that. The only way to get back is to wait for another guild to go in to kill named... oh yeah and on my server they only do that if ALL the named have popped /sigh. So I think that im royally screwed until a friendly cleric comes along. I really didnt know him that well but i knew he was a really nice person and he heard about my dilinma. He just told me that if I could get him a port to Cobalt Scar and 15 minutes he would be able to rezz me. I said &quot;sure&quot; and asked a friend to port him to Cobalt Scar. I went to get a drink of water and then I see it &quot;Cleric Wants to rezz you.&quot; Oh my god, this dude ran from Cobalt Scar, Sirens Ghettro, Western Waste, to Temple of Veeshan. From there he ran to the Aary point and all the way to PoM where he zoned in, disabled the traps and rezzed me. I was very greatful and very very shocked !</div></div><hr />

<br />
UBER1: &quot;hey! I am in thurg and my guild got wiped. can you rez me? I got a clik stick and will rez your group&quot;<br />

Uber1: &quot;k monk dragging it right now&quot;<br />

So the rez goes off, I heal and buff him while he is medding.<br />

About an hour goes by and I ask UBER1 if he will fulfill his promise.<br />

UBER1: &quot;NO!...I am busy right now&quot;<br />

The coffin for summon corpse is 175pp<br />
is a container not stackable, by the way can you summon a corpse then rez it?<br />
<br />
<br />
At level 57 necros get an upgraded summon corpse spell that uses stackable coffins that cost 75p each. And yes, you can res a summoned corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raktael</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, to be honest, I've never had any bad rezz experiences.<br />
I don't do rezzes for ppl who think my name is 'rezz me' or 'rezz please'...my names Raktael...not REZZ! get it right! People can be very rude, and those that are get ignored for rezzes. Thankfully, when I get tells saying 'please may I get a rezz' and I say I'm busy, I normally get a, 'np, good luck' which is nice.<br />
<br />
The same goes for when I need a rezz (the amount of times I have run naked across DL is scary to say the least) I do a /who all cleric in zone first, and if theres none in zone, I risk it! hehe. But if there are I always go 'excuse me, are you busy right now' and it's either 'yes, sorry' or 'no, what ya need' and I explain my situation. Common courtesy like this will get you a lot further in the future with people than '#%$$ rezz me you $@$#$%$, I'm gonna %$#$$ kill you' hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm now lvl 44, but when I only had my wittle 35% rezz this very kind person donated 255pp for it!! I was like OMG! My next highest was 105pp for a 60% rezz. We have to face the fact that before you get at least a 90% rezz people are stingy, and tight with their money, or like me, have none ;)<br />
<br />
If I am grouped, I will rezz non groupees, but only while groups in down time, and if they drag the corpse to me and I sually get 10-30pp donation and a thank you.<br />
<br />
If I see corpses somewhere, I also check if they r online. Like just last nite, I was in Lfay (hunting Ghasts and avoiding that annoying equestrielle!) and I come across a corpse /who all **** they r online, and lo and behold, a 21 cleric, so I send a tell and rezz them :) I get a thank you, thats good enough for me, fellow cleric. <br />
<br />
I've also donated armor and stuff I don't need to lowbie clerics, even if I know somewhere they probably have a high end main. I do it because I am kind and caring, and I don't need it anymore.<br />
<br />
To all non clerics: BEING NICE WILL GET YOU SOMEWHERE! We are clerics, who need to lvl and so on as well, we are not just there to rezz ure lifeless bodies zones away :) thank you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few months back at level 52 when I was in a different guild than I am in now, I was working on some tradeskills, was a lazy night and this was relaxing.   Over guildchat, I hear one of the resident warriors tell us there was a GM event starting in FV.  About 10 min later I get a tell from said warrior asking if I could come out to rez him and help out with this event since there was no clerics in the zone and he could/would sure use the help, how it would be so much fun blah blah.  So I thought, Ok! this sounds like fun and he needs the help.  <br />
<br />
I run from Freeport (where I was tradeskilling) to West Commons, PAY 10pp for a port to Dreadlands (sure np).  Upon arrival into DL, I send the warrior a tell letting him know my arrival and I should be there shortly.  I was asking him questions about exactly what was happening and is this something I might want to consider binding at the FV zone line since he said there were no other clerics and I wasn't exactly sure what &quot;kind&quot; of GM event this was.  He said yes, I probably should bind.  Np.  I zone in /bind myself and head out.   <br />
<br />
As I reach the tunnel before the spiders, I send him a tell asking where in the zone are they? Where is his body?  No answer.  I can see the ooc, I can see him spamming in ooc/shouts etc.  I ask him again, what is the loc?  Finally he says, &quot;Oh I couldn't wait for you any longer, I took a low level rez instead. (yet I had just talked to him before I bound at the zoneline not 30 seconds before this) We are at the bridge.&quot;   I was rather annoyed but did come to help out and have fun with the GM event too, so I set off to the bridge.  Upon arrival, I /tell him that I&quot;m here...right behind him in this MASS sea of people.  No answer.  I ask him again if he wanted my help in the group? No answer.  Hail, &lt;warrior&gt;  No answer.  Although he was pretty busy in ooc/shouts.  Fine....I back up to city end of the bridge...sit down.  Kinda mad, kinda confused.  If he wanted my help why was he ignoring me now.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly I get a tell. &quot;rez me I'm in your guildies grp&quot; Uhhhh...ok.  They drag to the end of the bridge and I rez.  Then he demanded buffs....symbol the hole nine yards.  Ok fine, this is &quot;how I&quot;m helping&quot; ok sure.   Then suddenly, I have another person show up with a body asking for rez and buffs.  Basically,  this warrior was sending his groupmates to me to buff/heal/rez but completely ignoring me.  This wasn't my idea of &quot;helping during a GM event nor feeling in any way having fun during one&quot;  Still, I thought ok, he  is just busy keeping up with the roleplaying of the event (he seemed to be pretty much the ringleader of it)  After all was said and done....event over....he won an extremely nice BP for his trouble. Grats guildmate!  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, of course, being that there was the lvl 29 cleric (the one that rezz'd him) and me lvl 52 cleric (unanon) in the zone, I was SPAMMED...beyond hell and back for rezzing.  Ok ok ok....I rezz'd my arse off.  No clarity, nothing.  I was a busy busy bee.  Suddenly I realize the zone is clearing out and quieting down.  I suddenly also realize...that this warrior guildmate in new duds has left zone and was somewhere over in Antonica at this point.  No goodbye, no thank you, no reimbursement for the peridots I spent buffing his group that he TOLD to come see me because I was &quot;helping&quot;, no arrangment for a ride out, seeing as how I had just bound in the zone. Nadda.<br />
<br />
After mass rezzing was done.  I ended up having to ooc for a port and had to pay for it, some druid I rezz'd even (didn't charge for any rezzing at all, refused donations because it wasn't they who had asked me here).  I was out a lot of money from ports/peris, time and felt pretty used.  I've had my bad experiences, but from a guildmate? never like this.  made a pretty big post on our guild boards describing what happened and to never take anyone forgranted. I had left his name anonymous and despite all that everyone seemed to know exactly who he was from past similar behaviour.  I never once to this day received an apology.<br />
<br />
Karma sucks tho.  I got a tell from him the other night in Ssra while I was with my guild doing Emp keys. His group had wiped out...and could I come rez. Hmmpft.<br />

When I'm in busy and won't be available to rez, I'll turn roleplay on.  If I'm not doing much, I'll usually leave it off, and honor any rez requests that aren't too out of the way.<br />
<br />
Once I had someone say 'can you rez me in lguk?  i'll pay 100pp heh'.  Sure, why not.  I was hanging out right outside the lguk zoneline, about to camp for the night.  I got his bod and rezzed him, only to have him promptly camp.  No thank you, no anything.  Aggrivating, to say the least.  If you have no intentions of paying, then don't offer.  To offer and not pay is simply asinine.  So to remedy this, if someone offers an exorbitant amount of cash, I usually tell them I'll do it for half of what they're offering.  Then they can't weasel their way out of paying by claiming I'm greedy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice post for a first post. I look forward to your second.<br />
<br />
I find several lures for this game. The tradeskills I thought brought balance to the game and I was overjoyed when stat bonuses were available for drink and food. Also, the human experience.<br />
<br />
A fellow cleric on Quellious once told me that when I hit 49, I will suddenly be granted a great deal of power. The power he was talking about was the power among players. I had something that people wanted. He was right, of course. Being needed is a double-edged sword, on one side we are sought after and appreciated, on the other side we are abused and treated rudely (until these jerks need something).<br />
<br />
The human experience.<br />
<br />
I love reading about the stories that solid clerics undergo with people who appear to be appreciative, then it turns on them. I liked the story about the Uber1 character appreciative of only their own res, but not willing to help another in the same case.<br />
<br />
I remember ressing someone who said he would pay very well for a res. I did the res and then he paid me 9pp and said thank you.<br />
<br />
I remember ressing someone for 20pp and he tried to give me Gold, silver and copper. From that day forward I asked if payment was to be in platnium.<br />
<br />
I've also had situations where a high level shaman needed a res to get back a level so she could participate in a raid. I cleared it with my group and then did the res. She gave me 800pp for a thank you. Wow this made my day. I had four times the amount of money in my bank.<br />
<br />
I also had a situation, I remember, not about a res, but I was fighting in Western Commonlands in a Derv group when this dwarf starts taking spawns. It was all right by us because a group had just left and we could use the split. However, he would fight a derv, shout that he needed help, we would pull the extra monsters and then he would finish off. He would run to me asking me for a heal. I spent a good 30 minutes healing him when mana allowed. (My group had fun watching him when we weren't fighting).<br />
<br />
Then he started becoming a real jerk demanding heals and buffs so he could get more mobs faster. He takes on a mob and casts a spell! I had thought he was a dwarven warrior in his bronze armor, but it turns out he was a cleric. I asked him why he could not heal himself and he said something like &quot;I don't use mana to heal myself, I use it to fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I stopped giving heals and buffs. We watched him come close to death and helped him. We even offered to have him join the group, but he refused. Good thing I was only level 7 or 8, he would have asked me for a res the two times he died.<br />
<br />
Well, I hope they are entertaining stories for you. Enjoy your day!<br />
