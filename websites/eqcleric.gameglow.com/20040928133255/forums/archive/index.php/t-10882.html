<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adon</div><div class="date">08-09-2001, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
Planning on going there this weekend with 3-5 groups to kill Phinny.<br />
<br />
Anything I should know about? We're going to go in and basically kill our way to his lair.<br />
<br />
We are about average level 48-49, with one level 59 and a couple of 55+ coming.<br />
<br />
The idea is to kill normal raid style till Phinny, then have the 59 druid pull his guards singly, then kill him as a whole.<br />
<br />
or have one of the monkees split them.<br />
<br />
Is this a good plan?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">08-09-2001, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You've certainly got the firepower to kill Phinny, the only question is your familiarity with the zone.  Has anyone in the raid killed him before?<br />
<br />
He's not particularly tough (I'd say a single good group of 55+ could kill him easily enough) - what makes him tricky is his Swirlspine seahorses.  They're level 50 or so, unmezzable, and extremely magic resistant (100%? not certain) and cast complete heal.  They are vulnerable to fire-based nukes though.  Guardian are pretty much the same deal, but they can be mezzed.<br />
<br />
Since they can CH, you really want to avoid pulling more than one at a time.<br />
<br />
A level 59 character may be able to single pull - don't know for sure.  They should be prepared to take a death rather than train the raid if it doesn't work.  FD pulling does work, but I'm told it's not particularly easy.<br />
<br />
Watch your EB!  If you have a mage with you, he can keep the raid supplied with waterstones: if you don't have an EB item (fishbone earring, rebreather, ancient fishing pole...) keep a waterstone ready to click at all times.  Being dispelled is a distinct possibility: be ready for it.<br />
<br />
Here's a great guide to Kedge (written by a former guildmate of mine who doesn't play any more...)<br />

<br />
Level 60 caster binds at the zone.<br />
Level 60 caster and wizard swim invis to Phinny's room.<br />
Wizard casts Translocate on level 60 caster.<br />
Level 60 caster aggros Phinny and then immediately accepts the Translocate.<br />
<br />
A couple minutes later Phinny will be at the zone, solo.<br />
Kill him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">08-10-2001, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clever, and reminiscent of the old Eye of Zomm trick (send an Eye down to Phin's lair and aggro him - again he ports to the zone, solo).<br />
<br />
However, be aware that this takes advantage of Kedge's screwy pathing and is almost certainly an exploit.  It's no longer possible to cast Eye of Zomm in Kedge...<br />

Those seahorses love to dispell.<br />
<br />
We took him with two groups with the lowest being 42 and two 60's (Druid Necro). It was a blast and I just love that dungeon. <br />
<br />
We pulled the seahorses with a 51 monk and peeled with a rogue. If everyone does not have some sort of constant Enduring breath ensure that you have a druid shammy or ranger set up to cast that as these guys love to dispell. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerie</div><div class="date">08-11-2001, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple notes about Phini and his guards:<br />
<br />
Phinigel's melee dispels, i.e. every single time he hits you, he will dispel one of your buffs. Your main tank will be totally buffless after tanking him for few rounds, so be ready to spam enduring breath or carry fishbone earring. (and adjust your heals accordingly) On the other hand, Phini is relatively low on MR - if your shaman or enchanter is high enough level, they'll be able to stick slow on him. Most people pull him to the entrance ledge to his lair, but I suppose you could pull him pretty much anywhere in the zone since he doesn't gate. (old world rules)<br />
<br />
Swirlspine seahorses are pretty much immune to magic based spells, including mez. Fortunately, they are relatively easy to pull even without feign puller - and your 59 druid, if he is seasoned enough of a puller, will be able to do the job. Swirlspine guardians - which pop in the pit upon the death of swirlspine seahorses - can be mezzed and charmed, but are much harder to pull. I really doubt your 59 druid can solo pull those, and up to three of them can pop after seahorses die. You will need a FD puller, unless you got an enchanter ready. Both seahorses cast various cleric spells including CHeal, and they proc vortex. (whirl-till-hurl) Repop time on seahorses is extremely quick - in order of 18 minutes or so.<br />
