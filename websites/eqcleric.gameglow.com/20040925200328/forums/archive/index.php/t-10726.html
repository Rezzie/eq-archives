Timourous Deep - I've been hunting Spiroc Lightfoots and Spiroc Watchers and Spiroc Proven.<br />
<br />
They don't hit too hard and don't seem to have too many HPs.<br />
<br />
(You people weren't lying... level 45 sucks by far and is slower than molasses going up hill in the winter time!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cathawk</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's some of my info to help you out.<br />
<br />
This is on the Spiroc Island in Timourous Deep.<br />
<br />
1. Spiroc Lightfoots - 2000 HPs roughly<br />
2. Spiroc Watchers - HPs are inbetween Lightfoots and Provens<br />
3. Spiroc Provens - 2500 HPs roughly (backstabs for 300!!!!)<br />
4. Spiroc Warriors - do not solo at 45 (Shaman. Has pet and can dispell.)<br />
<br />
Monsters in order of strength, as it appears to me.<br />
<br />
This is done at level 45, without SOW. I buff with Armor of Faith, Resolution and Symbol of Pinzarn.<br />
<br />
Spells memmed. Gate, Invoke Fear, Greater Heal, Divine Barrier, Enstill, Force, Holy Might and Retribution.<br />
<br />
I always rest near the base of the rocks (/LOC 5168, 979) and I've never (at least yet) have been nailed by a wandering monster.<br />
<br />
It is very possible to pull Spirocs off the tree in singles only. Not always, but most of the time. You just have to spend time walking around the tree and looking up to see where they are all at.<br />
<br />
I always use this pattern. Retribution to pull. Run to shore near /LOC. (don't go nuke happy right away. make sure you only pulled one.) If only one, then I cast Force, followed by Enstill till it sticks... then Retribution until dead or instill is needed again. Easy enough pattern. If you pull more then one, then Invoke Fear and determine whether you can handle it (I can't) and then stay or gate. <br />
<br />
Another thing, you cannot bind in Timourous Deep, so you have to bind in FV or BB.<br />
<br />
No lie, but this XP is outrageous for soloing at level 45... (and they're live creatures also, makes me feel all that more warm and fuzzy.)<br />
<br />
On my server, it's not a heavily populated place... yet. I do not know about your server.<br />
<br />
(oh ya... you take a faction hit. SpirocsOfTimorous gets worse.)<br />

Same thing for less mana, last I heard enstill has the same chance as root of breaking when the creature takes a hit.<br />
<br />
Just curious if you've actually noticed a difference, and this might be another eq myth.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
I've not heard this one before. I'm going to have to try the two spells. I *would* assume that Enstill is better than root, no?<br />
<br />
Now I'm going to have to check it!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cathawk</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More update on this great spot. I played for almost four hours last night and almost made a full bubble of XP. (Not bad at level 45!)<br />
<br />
I tried to solo a warrior. Not a smart idea. Not for me at level 45 anyways. I lead off with fearing the pet, which makes the warrior mad at me and he gains the initiative and the first strike basically. I say first strike, because he casts some sort of frost spell. He  can also cast dispell and root. He has a lot of HPs, so his pet returns before I even get close to killing it. I cannot kill it with FM and with the pet pounding on me I can't med for more mana. Our, if I fear the pet, I can Enstill it and med, but then it'll cast spells at me. So, if I fear the pet and Enstill the warrior to get a little more mana to finish off the warrior, I have to run far and med... in which time he warps back to start point with almost full life.<br />
<br />
So, I'm leaving this one alone for another level at least.<br />

That is all there is too it.  There is an undead spot in the NE corner of the zone (to the right as you leave Firiona Vie).  Plague Bones take 3 Banishes to kill.  Greater Spurbones take about 4 Banish and an Expel.  Greater Plaguebones are pretty tough, but can be done with about 7-8 bubbles of mana.  Wraithbone Champions, won't even go there.  This place has 6-7 spawns, and is close to the zone should you need to run (becareful for all you evil clerics.  Private Goldtouch usually wanders up by the zone and will has some pretty comic book banter to accompany an attack).  And (unless someone catches on and it gets changed), you can basically pull one skel over another without agroing the second.  Also, other mobs rarely wander back into this little corner.  Just root and nuke.<br />
<br />
If that is camped, or you are looking for something different to do, solo live stuff by the FV, BW, or Karnor's zones (sit on the north side of the castle and pull down to the pavement that is there).  At 45, I could do any spider (except for the Dread Widow I'm guessing which is supposidly around 50 or so and has a pretty nice caster drop).  You can also do the brutes and most of the dogs.  Ravishing drovlargs are too tough to solo, and the Raving ones are pretty hard also, but can be done with some medding.  Also, you can do some mountain giants.  Craigs can be done with about 1 bar of mana (169 Wisdom is all I have if anyone is curious), and Steeps can be done with a little medding also.  There are the chickens too, but I never bothered with them much.  The Stonegazers take 3 Retros, that I do remember, and I don't think I ever tried a Petrified.<br />
<br />
And as for Root, Enstill.  Root is a little bit quicker, and less mana than Enstill, but the main difference is when break checks are done.  I don't have the exact numbers, but just for examples sake, Root checks for breaks every 4 ticks, and Enstill every 6 ticks.  Both check everytime the mob is damaged.  It is something like that.  So, theoretically, Enstill should hold longer as it isn't checked as often, and therefore shouldn't break as often.  It is used primarily when you want to park a mob away from the group, or if you are soloing and need to med.  Otherwise use Root.<br />
<br />
My spells were Gate, DA, Reso, Superior Healing, Root, Enstill, and (Retro, Wrath) or (Banish, Expel).  And I always had Reso and Pinzin up on me.<br />
<br />
As a disclaimer, some of these mobs do hit into the 100's (Ragers, Ravishings, Greater Plaguebones, Wraithbone Champions, at least), so these aren't push over mobs.  If you do decide to solo here, take a book with you as you will have a lot of medding downtime unless you are blessed by a passing Enchanter (one of the perks of soloing at the FV zone and Karnor's castle).<br />
