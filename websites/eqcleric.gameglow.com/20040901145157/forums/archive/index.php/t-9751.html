<br />
I have been looking at the boards of a few other classes and you know what half of them are chatting about ??<br />
<br />
Well let me tell you, they are complaining about the colour and the style of there equipment !!!!<br />
<br />
Here are us Clerics, fighting over the few scraps of equipment we can use, struggling in the face of adversity to get our quest armour, while the other classes are saying “Umm I don’t like this new robe, the colour is so boring !!”<br />
<br />
Ack, would that we had so few issues to worry about that we could bitch about colour coordination too. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">12-20-1999, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hardly!  How can a class suck when it defines people's play sessions?  When I log for the evening my group normally shuts it down.<br />
<br />
Clerics are the glue that holds a group together.  Clerics are the enablers that allow groups to delve deep within a dungeon holding the expectations of loot and adventure, not mere survival.  Late at night in SolB or LGuk the calls for &quot;a healer in the XXX room, preferably a cleric&quot; are common.  One night I had a group &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;begging&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; me to go to the Assassin room with them; I was NAKED at the time (corpse was stuck in the wall).  After 1/2 hour of this they hooked up with a druid.  Poor guys never did make it to the Assassin room (it's the very first room within the tower in LGuk's dead side.<br />
<br />
I could continue on, but let me address your specific complaint; namely, that of equipment.  Before any class had quest armor guess which class had available the widest variety of equipment.  Yep, the Cleric class.  We can wear the plate of a tank, the leathers of a Druid, and the chain based armor of the Shamans and Rangers.  We can choose high AC, high Wisdom, or a mix of the two.  We can play front-line with the tanks or hang in the back with the casters.  Granted, we might not last as long as a tank, but that's a HP issue, not an AC issue.  Our Defense goes just as high.  Show me a pansy-in-a-robe tanking a mob and I'll show you a corpse-in-a-robe very shortly.<br />
<br />
Don't let the quest armor get to you; the issue really doesn't affect you in the mid-30s and later.  This is because you can get into higher level groups (if you wish) where BETTER armor is available.  <br />
<br />
We can go offensive (you will ROCK undead once you hit 34, and let's not even talk about 44, can you say 585 for 200?).  We have damned good buffs (hps, ac, resistances).  And of course, we can heal.  We are 2nd to none as healers.  At level 40 druids and shamans are strictly relegated to secondary healers; they cannot heal a tank fast enough to turn the tide of a battle.  A level 40 tank does not notice a 300hp heal; it's less than a bubble.  Superior Heal is the minimum usable heal.  And if the fight is controllable, Complete Heal is super mana-efficient at 400 mana (can you imagine 1600 hps from one spell? that's Complete for you).<br />
<br />
Do Clerics suck? Hardly!<br />

I have grouped with all of the other classes and find too many faults in them (of which I won't elaborate on, would take too long).  There are 2 classes you can't live without.  One, is the tank.  You just can't survive without someone taking the brunt of the damage.  Second, you can't survive without a healer.  And past level 34, if you aren't a cleric you aren't a healer.  I don't see how you can survive without these two types of characters in your group.<br />
  Now, with that thinking in mind, how bad off are cleric?  Not bad at all.  Yes, our quest armor is a running gag.  Yes, we seem to be in the dog house for class improvements.  BUT, combat doesn't continue without heals and NO ONE else gets the good ones.  Heals aren't our only attribute, but they are an important attribute.  Stuns, res, and buffs help round us out (better in my opinion) than many other classes.<br />
  In my opinion and experiences, its wizards and mages who suck.  They are a glass jaw with some minor pyrotechnics, easily replacable.<br />
  I dearly wish Verant would make our quest armor worthwhile but I am not going to hold my breath on that one.  I just play my cleric as best I can and serve my guild with whatever tools I am given.<br />

Fare thee well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domanic</div><div class="date">12-21-1999, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys, I know Clerics rule, I have seen over and over Wizzy's and Rogues passed over for a spot in a group in preference for a Cleric or a Tank.<br />
<br />
We are the anchor stone for an successful dungeon crawl, the safety net for all the other players.  I see it all the time, I go link dead and when I log back 2 mins later I find the body of one of the group lying on the floor in a room full of mobs because without me, they couldn’t control the room. (Thank god for DA)<br />
<br />
On the same respect it really hurts having to fear and run to the zone from a green mob.  I'm sure that this will change now that I have Wrath, but at 27-28 my 83 damage Smite was a joke.  <br />
<br />
What also smarts for me at times is being on a semi new server.  There is no cool Cleric stuff around to buy and I have to compete against Shammys and Doggies for crappy leather +wis items because all the Chain and Plate +Wis items are level 35+.  Druids on our servers charge 10pp for a teleport and some enchanters are charging 10pp for an Enchant Plat spell.  How can we outbid them for items considering the money they rake in.<br />
<br />
It took me 6 weeks to get a pair of Med Bronze legs (no one was selling), 4 Weeks to get my BST and 3 weeks just to get a bar of platinum enchanted.  <br />
<br />
Therefore I’m just a little upset at not being able to get stuff when in a typical HPK group I see a bard with 4 or 5 pieces of Crafted, a Warrior in full Crafted a shaman in fully crafted, a rogue in partial ravenscale. Half of them tell me that they got most of their stuff in about 2 weeks of camping and all of their stuff walks the floor on Cleric Crafted.  <br />
<br />
The only classes I don’t see in crafted are Rangers and Paladins as their quests cost a lot of money like ours and require them to kill higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyhow enough for now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalaelyan</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Fashionwise&quot; I think Clerics must be the luckiest class in Norrathian existence.  One thing I really hate about enchanters (and other casting classes) is that we either wear some goofy-looking robe (some more goofy than others, but for the most part, they are *all* goofy-looking) or we go without a robe and look mis-matched because we can't get a full set of leather-look, or chain-look, even if the armor we do have shows up on us.<br />
<br />
As an enchanter, I would do practically anything to get a tunic that looked like leather or chain and wasn't yet another robe. *sigh*  <br />
<br />
Robes are boring, particularly when there is really no choice about wearing one.<br />
<br />
But my cleric!!! AHHHH My cleric can wear *ARMOR*!!! I swear it must be one of the most exciting things about having a cleric character.  <br />
<br />
And it's not like warriors who can wear armor and then eventually will all look exactly alike in light-blue crafted, clerics have multitudes of different types of *useful* armor to wear.  I don't think I've ever seen a cleric who looked exactly like another cleric!<br />
<br />
I just don't think clerics really *can* complain about color coordination, so maybe that's why you don't hear it on the cleric boards.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
For that kind of thing, most of the other classes really *do* have it boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try going to Cazic Thule and getting a group.  You will find that there aren't many Clerics around and you will end up answering several tells saying &quot;Thanks, but I already have a group.&quot;  At 25, I find a I end up with groups that have a 26 to 28 tank and Greater Healing only does about a bubble and a half or so healing.  In order to reduce the amount of healing I do, I chain stun on the tougher mobs when possible.  With this technique, I prevent the mobs from getting past the tank to a caster leaving the caster free to burn as he wishes.  Unless the mob has been through the temple and gotten buffs, they usually don't resist much either.  I rarely need my armor, and could probably get a group there if I was naked.  Yes, the Cleric armor has about 3 less AC than the other Class armor, but it has one great advantage to poor humans like you and me.  It weighs as much as small plate armor!  This makes us much more comparable to dwarves Clerics when it comes to carrying capacity with better looking women. : )  Last night, I got my Cleric Boots too, I went from 8.1 weight medium bronze boots to 4.9 weight Boots of Reliant and gained 1 AC.  Not great, but the extra 3.2 carrying capacity means I don't have to destroy a little bit.  As I get more pieces, I will be able to carry more loot.  Sure, I will probably be replacing it when I can in order to get +wisdom items, but I will still keep my Cleric armor in the bank for use in marriages and guild meetings.<br />
<br />
I am just starting to feel good about my Cleric since 23 and below which was pure hell.  Now is NOT the time to quit.</div></div><hr />
