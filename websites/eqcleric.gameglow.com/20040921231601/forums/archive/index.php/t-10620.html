<br />
The guards will not help with Rock Hoppers - not sure with the Recusos, so be warned.  If in doubt, zone.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mon Letalis is much higher than 30 and has no guards.</div></div><hr />

I thought i would pass on some of that information.  <br />
<br />
First off here is  a list of possible good places to go for experience.<br />
<br />
Overthere, Lower Guk, Dawnshroud Peaks, Dreadlands, and a bit of SolB, KC, and Com too. <br />
<br />
I think this is a pretty good list from what i've obtained in only afew weeks.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps..and if anyone else has any ideas for what would bring me up to level zone between 50-60 that would be awesome to know about. ;)</div></div><hr />

You'd be better off spending your time in Dawnshroud or also Crystal Caverns  (velious Eastern Wastes dungeon). Also in the mid-upper 30's you can begin to take a group to Tenebrous Mountains and work the Grimling miners in the south of the zone, just keep away from the undead.</div></div><hr />
