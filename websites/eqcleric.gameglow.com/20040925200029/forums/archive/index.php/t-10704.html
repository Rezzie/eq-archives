We were there last night killing roamers, I could not stay for long but we killed maybe 5 clerics of who 3 of them dropped cleric armor; Boots, Arms and Shield (yeah of course i had to win boots, bah). So over half the clerics we killed actually dropped armor, YAY! =) Same thing with the male revenants, almost every single one dropped Magician armor (we got robe, sleeves and some other parts). So definetly thumbs up for plane class specific armor drop!<br />

We got cleric boots, gloves, helm, a bracer and the shield.  I saw 3 rogue armor drops, 1 bard weapon, 1 warrior gloves, 1 pally mace weapon thing, and absolutly no enchanter or mage stuff.  I won the helm (man are those things ugly on humans), but the AC on it is very nice so I guess I'll wear it.  I'm keeping my nightshade wreath though for when I don't want to look like a dork.  So, now if I could just win the lotto for pants I'd be done, and I'd always be invited to hate since I'd be fully decked out and not competing for the armor bits anymore. *snickers*<br />

yea. helms on humans are ugly as sin, though i dont know which is worse. . . the human bucket, or the high-elven (Elmer Fudd) baseball helmet.</div></div><hr />

We managed to stagger spawn of the WHOLE fear plane, and have kept it like that for 5 days now. I have been there for 3 of those days and the drops have been extremely rare.<br />
<br />
report :<br />
<br />
cleric items    : 2 belts, I got one<br />
shaman items    : 2 belts<br />
druid items     : none<br />
necro items     : 1 set of gloves, one set of arms<br />
wiz items       : none<br />
enchanter items : none <br />
warrior items   : whip and shield<br />
SK items        : 2 gloves (1 decayed), 1 bp ( decayed )<br />
monk items      : 1 gloves, one tunic ( decayed but replaced by brother xave )<br />
ranger items    : 1 helmet, one axe<br />
<br />
 Added to this, is a MOUNTAIN of words and runes.<br />
This sounds all like a lot of equipment, but it is not... we killed each monster over and over again, no spawn was ignored.<br />

We cleared it friday and took out some respawns on saturday with hardly any items being dropped. I think it was like 5 nice items on all those spawns (no cleric items at all  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif )... Good thing for us though that PoH still drops alot of nice items.<br />
