Now that I have the time, I can't bring myself to log on, and the thought of playing  Heroes of Might and Magic is more appealing. I know I'll be back to Norrath in a week or so, I was only wondering if this kind of apathy has effected anyone else, and how frequently?<br />

Being level 51 now, I am now finally finding the game to be more work then fun. Experience is slow and thus more and more hours needed to sit in front of my computer. Kunark is a joke if you dont have a bunch of friends to SOW and Port you around unless you wanna run to the nearest zone which is always too far away.<br />

Actually this should be in the rant section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gondain</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've taken 2 breaks from the game.  One last summer for 3 months (My primary was a rogue...I wasn't real happy with Verant).  <br />
<br />
And recently I took 6 weeks off from EQ after I hit 49 with my cleric.  A few friends went on break as well.  D2 had come out, so it made it easier to take a break.  Most are starting to come back now.  <br />
<br />
Almost everyone I know has taken a break at some point from EQ.  I just stayed in touch with people via guild message boards and logged in now and then to chat with friends.  One day when I had logged in to chat I got an urge to go do something, been playing since again.</div></div><hr />

I used to love that game.  I find it a bit more appealing than EQ right now, so I took a few days off.<br />

RL events including a new girlfriend have limited my time playing, and to be honest it was a real effort to log on Sunday for a few hours.<br />
<br />
 It was, of course, worth my while once I did as I finally dinged out of 35 (BEGONE FOUL HELL LEVEL), and a guildmate of mine surprised me by presenting to me a Chestplate of the Constant (WOOHOO, fully golden minus one bracer)!!!!<br />

I've come close to cancelling my account a couple of times recently, but that's probably too hasty.  I haven't been playing much at all recently, and when I have, it's been with my low level warrior.<br />
<br />
I logged Morrun in last week, considered what to do for a minute or two, then logged him out.  I just couldn't be bothered to play.  I'm hoping it'll pass - with all the work I've put into him, I don't want to just ditch him now, but high level play just seems like hard work at the moment.<br />

The time I do have Ive been playing Icewind Dale for many reasons.  Very easy to get a party together, I can pause the game, if I die just reload last saved game, and when I find a nice cleric Item I just give it to my cleric, no complaints from the other characters  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find alot of people play EQ the &quot;wrong&quot; way. Let me explain first before you all start going nuts. How many of you log on, try and find a group and then just kill things, weather it be for experience or items/money. Now obviously if you ever want your character to get better and stronger thats what you have to do, BUT how many of you have ever helped a newbie get a level or two? Ran around Norrath to find as many people as you could heal (no charge)? How many teen level clerics have sat around in Kithicore all night to see if they could survive? And not died http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Or followed a raid into Nagafen or Voxs Lair? How many of you have bought a rediculous amount of booze and had a drinking party with anyone who would drink with you, just to laugh at how messed up your speech gets?<br />
Do you all get what I'm trying to say? Too many people I know are SO interestead in leveling or ammassing items that it really is pointless in the end because it is a game and if you're not having fun why are you playing it? I fell into that trap for a while and stopped playing for a month. I have been playing for months now and I am level 19, my friend who started 3 weeks before me is now level 31. I am more interested in having fun and meeting people than &quot;gaining things&quot;, whatever they may be.<br />
It kind of reminds me of a Dragon Mirth comic I read once. There was this tall box with a slit in the side of it and two warriors standing to either side and an obviously inexperienced warrior standing in front of the box staring stupidly at it. There were all these warning signs that said things like &quot;beware of live minotaur&quot; and &quot;do not feed the Minotaur&quot;  but there was one more sign above the slit in the box that said &quot;Insert sword here for 75 exp.&quot;<br />
And thats what it basically boils down to in the game, you go out and kill things to gain levels. Kind of oxy moronic for a cleric don't ya think? The best example I can give is the Paladin's Ghoulbane sword, it's an awsome weapon and I'll be the first to admit it, but do you know what they have to do to get it? They have to kill a Froglok Paladin! Not a Shadow Knight or a Necromancer or anything else. They have to kill a fellow Paladin in order to take his weapon. And not only is he a Paladin but he is a Froglok, a race that is supposedly &quot;evil&quot;. This Froglok has proven his worth and his &quot;goodness&quot; and then they kill him, no sorry they murder him, for his weapon. And yet the questing for items continues.<br />
Maybe they could have an experience system for doing what your class was meant to do? That would be fun, going around and healing people and gaining experience for it because thats what we are supposed to be doing.<br />
Personally I think ALL classes should be able to solo until a very high level. But in order to balance it out make it so that grouping yields greater benefits. Why do certain classes have the ability to solo and not all, if verrant wants balance then make in balanced. It makes it very difficult to play when you only want to play for an hour and spend most of that time finding a group. But in the end we have to spend months of online time to gain items and money which takes even more time and it all boils down to more money for verrant.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dorad</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well - EQ is like this... either you play or you don't play. <br />
<br />
Over the last 2 months I have been playing maybe 1 hours a night or not at all and sometimes 3 hours on the weekend. All my friends have now out leveled me, moved on to a twink or new game etc... <br />
<br />
It's really hard to build new relationship because I am not on long enough to do it. If it werent for RL friends who play this game I would have quit 2 months ago. <br />
<br />
I have found this game is not for the casual gamer - or people who fall it following:<br />
<br />
Works full time (45+ hours week)<br />
Family<br />
Social Life<br />
Hobbies (beyond EQ)<br />
<br />
Now if you truly Rich , Lazy, Disabled this game for you.<br />

<br />
I get on to play, on average, about 3 hours a week anymore - basically, one evening.<br />
<br />
I'm actually finding a nice bonus in the time it takes people to go from 50-60 - they're not pulling away from me as fast.  I'm 39, going on 40 - but I still see experience with these 51st level folks.<br />
<br />
Someone talked about helping lower level folks - I do this on an extremely regular basis.  I head down to Blackburrow for an evening every level, and usually futz about in novice zones when I'm on the way back to a city.  Most of these folks are the ones I'm grouping with a month later.  (&quot;Hey, I remember you - you saved me from an Orc!&quot;)<br />
<br />
I took a couple month break - was nice.  Missed the adventure, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veloran</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in my circle of friends and guildmates, the focus of play shifts dramatically post 50. Guildmates in their 40's are pushing hard and fast to be plane capable or if already plane capable, to hit 50. But once you're 51+, it's not very realistic to see your exp fly up like in the lower levels. If all you did was kill a mob look at your exp bar, you would go insane. I've been 52 for over a month and I'm only half way through. But there's no rush, my friends are all around my level (most 51 and 52, and a couple at 53, 54, 55) but it's not like someone is going to massively out level me. Sometimes I just log on to buff guild members, chat in guild and with friends, solo a mob or two then call it a night. <br />
<br />
I find that at post 50, the game once again is fun for the casual gamer, or one who isn't completely consumed with the need to level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drzero</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 08:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have taken a break from the game. It's been 4 weeks now, and everytime I think about logging in, I think. &quot;... nah.&quot; I've been playing D2 and Torment. Sure I have fun running around buffing and healing newbies, but sorry, EQ as a glorified chat room only is exciting for so long.<br />
<br />
It's not that I'm obsessed with leveling. It's the *downtime*. Heck, Even killing greens has a long downtime while I med back up. *yawn*<br />
<br />
I have had the urge to play lately though. Maybe I'll be giving it another go soon. Who knows.<br />
