For some reason both of my orders never made it past the &quot;requesting credit card authentication&quot; phase.<br />
<br />
After over 100 attempts, I FINALLY got through to the Zomax line. I followed the menus through to the &quot;find out info about shipping&quot; or whatever it was - the thing thats supposed to let you know the status of your package. Well, I got a canned message saying sorry for the delay, but most shipments went out on the 21st. Thanks. (click - dialtone).<br />
<br />
THEY HUNG UP ON ME!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
To anyone that calls, DO NOT CHOOSE THE SHIPPING STATUS OPTION. Choose something else instead, maybe you'll have better luck.<br />
<br />
(sigh) back to the dialtone. Can I sue for repetitive stress injury from chain dialing?</div></div><hr />

I declined to order the upgrade due to costs of US $16 + US $57 shipping.<br />
<br />
The people in my guild (mostly NZ) who ordered it (yes a few did) were happy to hear they will be refunded the $57, but are still yet to get their upgrade.<br />
<br />
Today the game is in store locally for approx $45 US, so im buying it and using it to upgrade.<br />
<br />
What amazes me is that this is both cheaper and faster than ordering via the online shop, with 'overnight' delivery.<br />

Then I ran up to Best Buy and bought the full version. Glad I did. They hadn't even processed my credit card yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The CD shipped on Tuesday.  As of Wed., it still had no tracking number.<br />
<br />
I'm calling in a few hours to get the tracking number.  I'm not too happy either, it was supposed to be shipped on the 11th, not the 25th.<br />
