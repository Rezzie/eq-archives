<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">03-19-2001, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've been doing Velketor's a lot lately. Kobolds are great XP, about as good as Charasis and has the advantage of being different.  Anyway, we've killed every named kobold we've come across (both up near the gargoyles and down in the basement) as well as several of the bigger golems (Kerdelb and the dude who drops the Crystalline torque).  The vast majority of this hunting including the Kerdelb fight (hits for 420, could not slow with Enchanter) was with one group.<br />
<br />
What I'm curious about is just how tough is Lord DjollinIcan'tpossiblyremembertherestofhisname?  Friday night we had two groups down there and we were looking at him long and hard, but decided it was too late to do a CR for 12 (yea, we wussed out).<br />
<br />
So, is he slowable?  Does he have a bazillion hit points?<br />
<br />
Also, anyone know of a good list of the named's in Velketor's?  So far, other than the 1hs we got for a Paladin and the Crystalline Torque the loot was not impressive.<br />

<br />
We killed him with 1 death (A ranger, how odd) did not try to slow. Used single tank action.<br />

Should stick on him and youll have no problems.  1 60 ench should be able to handle the spiders, 59 too i think (rapture is 59 i believe)<br />

Do the single tank with defensive disc strategy and he's a pushover.  Our record at this point is doing him with 12 people and no deaths...not even a pet!  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
ps...be sure to bring a monk along, he drops some SERIOUS no-drop monk loot  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

They even mentioned to me that they got cocky on him (they lost 4 times in a row to Velketor). Spiders are as tough as hunters, and we were killing them the next day for exp/loot (no Bob) and our 57 chanter was having no problems mezzing them.<br />

Never got a slow on, don't know if you can. Had a 57 warrior as the primary on him, don't know that he had time to use a /disc.<br />
<br />
Don't think I'd recommend 'Lord Bob' with 12 unless they are predominantly 59/60.<br />
