<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">11-04-2002, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got bord late last night, so I decided to see if I could solo clear the fire giants in Nagafen's Lair. Unfortunatly there were none spawned outside of Nagafen's room, and he was home, so I got ported out as soon as I tried to pull any.<br />
<br />
About that time, I remembered I had an old score to settle with the dwaves of Kaladim. An &quot;incedent&quot; in my youth that I won't go into.<br />
<br />
So I headed over to Kaladim via the new convenient PoP portals and headed in to see what kind of trouble I could get into.<br />
<br />
I thought I had found some real trouble......<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~mbeiser/Images/Dwarffight1.JPG <br />
<br />
....but it turned out to be no trouble at all.<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~mbeiser/Images/Dwarffight2.JPG<br />
<br />
So after roaming around some more and killing various dwarf guards, a few merchants, and the odd citizen here and there, I came upon the king himself.<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~mbeiser/Images/Dwarffight3.JPG<br />
<br />
I think he realized right off that he was overmatched, so he called for help.<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~mbeiser/Images/Dwarffight4.JPG<br />
<br />
But it did him no good, maybe next time he should call on higher powers, for the dwarves of Kaladim are no match for The BATTLE CLERIC of Innoruuk. =)<br />
http://home.comcast.net/~mbeiser/Images/Dwarffight5.JPG<br />
<br />
And the obligitory loot shot, nothing special. =/<br />

<br />
More BATTLE CLERIC adventures coming soon. =)</div></div><hr />

That's the beauty of /viewport you can have a setup like that and not have the windows block any of the graphics at all :)</div></div><hr />

1) My king is a WUSS<br />
2) He drops crap loot<br />

I mean, the Dain has it all over Kazon. I think that I'm going to apply for citizenship in Thurgadin. I'm ashamed of Kaladim.</div></div><hr />

He needs 15-20 levels and a load of AA's if he's ever gonna defend Kaladim again in a decent manner.<br />
<br />
I mean, soloed by a cleric? /sigh<br />
<br />
Good one about his uber buddies, especially Dain will have a few cheap laughs on his expense :D</div></div><hr />

I'm 65. Time to have a word with the townsfolk of inkieville... Are there some NPCs  I missed that are still blue in the old world?  Neriak for example?  And no, I'm not talking about the city gate guards that are light blue and hit for 400</div></div><hr />

I think that I'm going to apply for citizenship in Thurgadin. I'm ashamed of Kaladim. Many of the dwarves in Thurgadin are heretics though. :( Any priest of brell worth their beer knows that Veeshan is the only enemy Brell has and many of those cold dwarves aid the dragons. Personally I just have fun slaughtering the elves and minions of Tunare as revenge on the druids that are always killing the citizens of Butcherblock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's lotsa fun to be had inside Neriak Trust me...<br />
<br />
 ONE thing...YOu need a DA puller near the SK trainers...<br />
 10 SK guards with HT can ruin anyone's day...<br />
 BUT wave of fear em over n over and put yer mass pets on em...dey is TOAST...har har har...JUST wave of fear em where they get stopped by walls...of the zone...buildings they will poof outta...<br />
<br />
 12 Dwarven Clerics n Paladins took out 90% of neriak once and I got ported out by GM from Queen's chambers for almost spawning her by doing a cycle of mobs there...<br />
 Prob a game breaking quest that never got finished...their first Sleepers...<br />
 THERE ARE TONS OF STUFF THAT NO ONE HAS FOUND IN NERIAK THAT PLACE HAS TONS OF HIDDEN PASSAGES HIDDEN ROOMS AND HIDDEN NPC-MOBS...<br />
 TRACKERS will see this themselves...<br />
 VI stated that 20% of the old world has never been explored...<br />
 Well 5% of that is UNDER  and INSIDE NERIAK....<br />
<br />
<br />
 Bored? Gather up a Ton of yer RP friends...Screw EXPS<br />
 ELFS want to regain faith of yer church- HUNT INKIE CLERICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IN NERIAK!!! CLEAR THE ZONES Make it a RAID!! There are spots on the maps that scream Try to come in here...<br />
 Sure some of ey will die HORRIBLY...BUT the fun, the suspense...and breaking out your Trance and LULL spells AOE too...yer pets...using DA DB again as a plan not an Just in case...<br />
 mass roots, mass fears just to see what comes...mass AOE parties...EARTHQUAKE muhahahaha....<br />
<br />
 Want FUN Goto the Bordello in Neriak- sneakers talk to everyone...if ye got an inkie mask USE IT...makes for allot of FUN...<br />
 Higer end chanters no longer need to worry about their spells...<br />
<br />
 there are places in Neriak even hometown residents might die in...so explore- Map and document...talk...<br />
 After SOV I never went back to neriak only because noobs and my friends thought there was nothing left to find there...<br />
<br />
 we could be wrong...<br />
 But then smashing inkies to paste is always good fun...<br />
 and storming Neriak for Brell that's a event ye can share in hte pubs fer centruies to come...<br />

:D :D :D <br />
<br />
Sir I salute you. <br />
<br />
If more people took this attitude EQ would be a happier place. Now personally I like Neriak and its one the few places where Im dubious or better (being evil)....<br />
<br />
The thought of clearing out Felwithe or even better raiding on Rivervale....... hehehe oooh now that appeals....<br />
<br />
Its like the Qeynos Catacombs, Ive never seen anyone get in there and never heard of anyone taking the Bertoxx temple. Apparently its very tough....<br />
<br />
Fun isnt always about loot and xp..... :D</div></div><hr />
