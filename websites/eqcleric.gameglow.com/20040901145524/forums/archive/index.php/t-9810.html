<br />
My ignore list is full... Can't add more... Keep trying to keep the beggars out of my hair - Doesn't work...<br />
<br />
Someone begged a heal last night.. I look over.. Melee class, ok, heal isn't a problem... Asks for a buff too... Sure, what the hell.. Toss a reso...<br />
<br />
&quot;Got anymore?&quot;<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Got anymore buffs?&quot;<br />
&quot;You just begged a heal and a buff, and be happy for what you got! That buff is higher than you'll see for a long time from any groupmates you get!&quot;<br />
&quot;Got anymore buffs?&quot;<br />
&quot;I should DEBuff you and kill you&quot; <br />
<br />
(Can you tell my patience is wearing thin?)<br />
<br />
Is there a point where this STOPS?<br />
<br />
Am I wrong here, or is begging something that could constitute harrassment?<br />
<br />
I'm now going invis just to get into towns for food, just to get away from the constant inspections and beggars... <br />
<br />
The inspection thing makes me nuts too  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thistleburr auctions: Buying bone chips 2pp per stack of 20, send tells if you have them.<br />
Doofus tells you: Will you give me 2pp I need to buy all my spells.<br />
Doofus02 tells you: I'll take 2pp you a necro need bone chips im necro too 3rd lvl we rock<br />
Doofus03 tells you: can u tp me to Freeport?<br />
<br />
Thistleburr auctions: Trading Valor (+184HP/+12AC) buff for SoW<br />
Doofus tells you: I got no sow buff me im on road cuz guards kos me<br />
Doofus04 tells you: U sell me that glowing shield?<br />
Doofus03 tells you: can u tp me to Unrest?<br />
<br />
<br />
People flat out demanding money from me because I am trying to buy things. They are not even selling me something, just poor attempts at thuggery.<br />

<br />
I was in Misty one day auctioning to buy honeycombs.  A fellow tells me that he has 10 and I offer to buy them all at a fair price.  <br />
<br />
I cross the zone to meet him and while he stands there (slow typer I was guessing) I cast valor and AoF on him and then topped it with Symbol because I was happy to get the honeycombs and he wa around level 6 and could really benefit from them.  <br />
<br />
After a moment he says &quot;Sorry, I sold half to someone else who offered a gold more than you did and I'm saving the rest since I can get more money.<br />
<br />
I said &quot;Sure, I understand, here let me help you out.&quot;<br />
<br />
After which I memmed dispel and cast it on him five times.<br />
<br />
He asked why I did that and I said &quot;Sorry, I got a better offer&quot; and trundled away.</div></div><hr />

Well these two level 2's (yes level 2's) kept begging me for buffs and even an exp res, well I buffed them but refused to do an exp res.  They would not explain to me why they were in unrest and kept getting themselves killed.  I finally got so tired of being hassled that I even refused to buff them, and I ended up leaving to get some piece and quiet.  <br />
<br />
It's easy to hit the ignore XXX but trust me they can still use general chat. <br />

I'm gonna try to petition tonight and see what answers I get, or what options... There has to be a good solution to this, as it pretty much destroys the feel of norrath pretty badly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">03-06-2000, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree completely.  And it's not just us, it's enchanters, shamen, druids, anyone who can perform &quot;services&quot; or cast buffs (namely SoW and hp buffs).<br />
<br />
My husband plays an enchanter, and I'm always astounded by how many people think a.) he's rich from making jewelry (haha) and b.) he's willing to travel up to 3 zones just to give some 12th level necromancer clarity.  Right.  No folks, we don't have anything better to do.  We don't really want to level, or get equipment, we live to serve YOU.<br />
<br />
I have newbie and twink clerics asking me for cleric armor.  Sure!  As soon as I have some, I'll just bust my hump to go get you some.<br />
<br />
I love hanging out in newbie zones and buffing random people - that's fun, and most people appreciate it.  When they start asking me for free stuff and money, that's when it ends and I gate somewhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">03-06-2000, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe you people are just too nice. I buff people when they aren't asking for it and I happen to have resolution loaded (it's a great help). Then again if someone asks me REALLY politely and I'm in a good mood this might happen, but lets take a scenario from the not so recent past:<br />
<br />
I'm sitting near WFreeport gate with my lvl 50 wiz friend.<br />
<br />
Doofus: could you guys give me some money?<br />
Me: are you serious?<br />
Wizard: /rofl Doofus<br />
Doofus: yes, only 50pp would help a lot<br />
Me: try making money yourself please, we got what we have that way<br />
Wizard: aye, it's actually fun to earn something, try it out<br />
Doofus: but it takes so long<br />
(yes he actually said this =)<br />
Me: lol, bugger off<br />
Wizard: damn straight<br />
---- 1min goes by ----<br />
Doofus: come on now, just 50pp, you must have 10k pp (I didn't know this myself btw), it's not like it hurts you<br />
Me: hey look (wizards name), the beggar is still here, and I thought he didn't have much time, odd...<br />
<br />
At this point the wizard tries to invite him to our group, heading for Tox Forest. Doofus gets the hint and leaves the scene.<br />
<br />
Didn't have any need to ignore, haven't heard from him since. Prolly will start a thread about arrogant highbies, but he sure had that one coming.<br />

It's faster this way.. Tell him ya gotta med. Point him in the general direction for Ogguk.  <br />
<br />
Don't I wish.<br />
<br />
Sigh<br />
<br />
I'm not that cruel, but damn, some days I wish I were an inkie cleric. I gotta go to the bank to get it.. Come with me ... Take him to Neriak  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drzero</div><div class="date">03-15-2000, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahem. Being an &quot;inkie&quot; as you &quot;lighties&quot; so quaintly put it really reduces the begging. Most people in Nektulos keep to themselves, and very rarely do I get people begging in FP or EC either.. most light race newbies don't talk to a Teir'Dal.<br />
<br />
However, I have had a dwarven cleric strike up a conversation for a good ten minutes before finally asking if I had any &quot;unused&quot; cleric equipment to help him out. I was impressed that he 1. roleplayed and 2. took the time to chat and ask nicely. I had just sold my FS Morningstar (had a Screaming Mace - didnt use it) but I gave him several plat anyway.<br />
<br />
I did have sone clueless human in N Ro ask if he could have my crude stien. <br />
<br />
n00bied00d is inspecting you...<br />
n00bied00d tells you, &quot;can i hav ur stien?&quot;<br />
Velora laughs at n00bied00d.<br />
Velora laughs at n00bied00d.<br />
Veloria rolls on the ground laughing at n00bied00d.<br />
Veloria says &quot;can i have ur stien? ahahahAHAHAHAHAHAH&quot;<br />
Veloria rolls on the ground laughing at n00bied00d.<br />
Veloria rolls on the ground laughing at n00bied00d.<br />
<br />
By this time nearby players are laughing at him too, and he quietly slinks away.<br />
<br />
I am waiting for one to demand a heal or buff (nobody has yet) and I'll cast invigor or something stupid on them. When they ask what that was, I'll say, &quot;I am missing a reagent for my spell, and it seems to be miscasting... I believe I need 1pp to cast this spell successfully.&quot; /em grins evilly at you and taps her mace in her hand.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynet</div><div class="date">03-15-2000, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, it happens to the lower levels folks as well.<br />
<br />
I am hunting in Blackburrow, and am REALLY looking forward to learning how to meditate.<br />
<br />
Many people like to solo in blackburrow.  Many of these people will get beaten up.<br />
<br />
Now, a high elf in a bronze helm with a mace and a shield is probably a cleric - and they run up and ask for a heal.<br />
<br />
I am torn - I want to help out, but I could easily spend my entire night sitting and waiting for mana if I did.<br />
<br />
My current policy is 1 heal per person, two if they are really beat up, unless we are either grouped or working together.  Then of course they get anything they need.  I won't let folks die, but I won't spend my downtime to decrease theirs either.<br />
<br />
(Thanks again to the fellow who pulled the gnoll guardsman off me while I was fighting the scrawny - and I am SO glad I was able to hit him with those 3 lesser heals just as he was at a 1/2 bubble of health from the guardsman)<br />
<br />
Of course, if I am leaving I will heal and buff all comers until I just have enough mana to gate, but that is a different situation - and I will anounce that I am healing because it is time to leave.<br />

     I went to the bank in Freeport &quot;naked&quot; to avoid begging and still was begged from. Bah, they even send begs in tells so others won't hear.<br />

What i like to do is tell them to meet me at some zone out of their league.  I usually get a &quot;But I will get killed there&quot;.  Then a response of &quot;Really are you sure?&quot; usually gets the point across.  However once, a newbie actually met me in SOL a bartender room..... I had to give him something for guts if not stupidity.<br />

<br />
What god do you worship?<br />
<br />
(Since of course, I will ALWASY philosophize about the greatness of Mithaniel Marr).<br />
<br />
They either respond and we get into an interesting discussion, or walk away. I will bless them no matter who they are (For we ALL secretly worship Marr) but I make them respond...<br />

Probably my favorite so far was when I was hunting Unrest and a high-elven paladin begged my teir'dal self for a heal. I healed him, and gave him an evil laugh just for good measure. Somehow I don't think he quite got it...oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has not almost everyone in EverQuest acted valorously repeatedly? Do we not willing charge monsters and risk death nightly?<br />

To do that, you must have at least a glimmer of valor in your heart...<br />
