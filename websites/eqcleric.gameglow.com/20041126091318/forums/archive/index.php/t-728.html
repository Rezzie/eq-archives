<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 06:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things I'd like to see are the following. Yes we are balanced in that we make a group X times more efficient, and in some situations we are required for any chance of success.<br />
 Over and over, mostly through levels 24-30, and again later from 38 to 43, clerics other than for rez series find a hard time getting into pick up groups on servers where shamans and druids are more numerous.<br />
 This leads to burnout and to the discovery that soloing isn't as easy of an option as it is for other groups. (We won't bother to compare to non-casting classes here aka melee classes, face it we are casters according to verant)<br />
 So What would make a cleric more fun to play? The Med stand heal med routine isn't fun at all. All the action you usually see is the result of your heal agroes. <br />
 Yes saving someone is exciting, but once you can no longer swing effectively in combat and must concentrate on healing full time to allow others to be most effective, you have been nailed into a niche.<br />
 This is where we loose most of the clerics out there. Upon the realization that the job itself has serious imitations and dangers. Or that your perty tush is gonna grow callouses from the assorted ground covering yer gonna plant yourself in for the next XX levels.<br />
 I reviewed my old old logs (March last year) from both Beta and From when Bertoxx went live. We once had higher dodge, we once could bash, we once could kick.<br />
 Now as a true dwarf I always thought bashing and kicking were fair game no matter the class, since kneecapping, gehettie knocking weren't offered fer dwarves, nor was toe stomping. The tools are there, just relabel the buttons and give it to the race-capped if  not normal for  that class...but that would be fun....and I don't think it would adversely affect balance in the game one way or another. (Elves could get scream like a ninny, which would stun a mob and effectively make em miss a beat in their attack routine...hehee). BUT AGAIN this isn;t where we should be fighting the battles for clerics...<br />
 What we need is a little more edge.<br />
 That edge is in our super low DODGE Cap (75), this is our fight for now.<br />
 We have with Rayne's help and others gotten a change that affected everyone's gameplay, htat being the change to the REZ mechanics, and the extension to the rez timer.<br />
 As clerics are want to, we do what's best for everyone as a whole. Now let's cry US too.<br />
 Not for nerfs, not for gear, not for tools to make the game better, but for a core change.<br />
 We are plate wearing class, therefore battle trained like no other caster class is in the game. <br />
 By Verant's math Paladins are a hybrid of warrior and cleric.<br />
 Our weapon skills are 75% that of a paladin effectively, but our dodge caps at less than that by a good amount. I think it may be on par with regular casters.<br />
 Now What are the dodge skills of shamans and  of druids? 75? if so we really have little to complain about, unless their battle skills  are capped higher than ours.<br />
 But like many dwarves, I grow tired of getting chipped to pieces so fast in battle.<br />
 So what is a doable Dodge cap? <br />
 100?<br />
 150? <br />
 I think we should have 75% of a paladin's dodge capabilities to fit in the mold offered.<br />
 SK's,Paladins and Rangers all hybrids have a higher cap...are they equal to each other's?<br />
 If someone could chart out shared skills for  SK's, Paladins, and Rangers. Then post the druid's, shaman's and cleric's in a table. We should be able to see where exactly the math fails and not be misguided by Verant's claim of balance.<br />
 ONE BIG THING THAT WORKS AGAINST ANY CHANGES  TO THE CORE CLERIC CODE IS, IF A CLERIC LIVES LONGER SO DOES HIS PARTY, AND THAT IS UNBALANCING IN THEIR EYES.<br />
  This can be pieced together by reading between the lines of all the posts made by verant.<br />
 Self sufficiency of a cleric is directly related to the amount of time a party will be fully effective. So any changes to a cleric would affect parites they grouped with too.<br />
 So what other changes to a cleric would bypass this?<br />
 MANA REGEN is totally out, dead issue.<br />
 Blessing items...that's on a wish list, but of course lack of imagination on the dev teams seems to be the norm.<br />
 Horses? BAH No real dwarf would be caught on a horse, our legs do the job just fine.<br />
<br />
 Enumerate our desires, eliminate that which would outright be tossed aside as unbalancing  overall and select one or two things we as clerics can use to make our lives easier or more fun and then pursue that avenue.<br />
 We should pick our fights and plan the battle field, knowledge is power, and as everyone knows, us Clerics are a smarter bunch than others...well maybe not smarter, but definitely wiser. <br />
 Where others throw fits and tantrums, we plan...now if Rayne and others see fit, let's plan it out here on this thread carefully before sending out feelers to other boards. If we have data, facts and reasonings layed out, refuting them would be tougher for oppponents to any benificial clerical event on Verant's part.<br />
 If we think it out for them, they won't have to. Make it easy for them, but rememeber, it could end up biting us in the ass too.<br />
 OUR Battle should in my opinion be for raising the dodge cap.<br />
<br />
 Them's me thoughts, I ain't carved em in stone yet, so let's get to haggling gentle beings. I got me keg of Holy water fer dah debating and me hammer fer wisdom adjustments as need be.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ohh though it doesn't really bother me, Verant did say that core spells of a class would never be given to another class.<br />
 As a cleric we heal and rez. So that stement has to be all true or all false.<br />
 Since there are other healer classes out there we can leave that one alone...we are just the best damn healers out there.<br />
 Buffing? Situationally, we are the most efficient...though numbers can be juggled on way or another and have been in arguements on this board before. Moot point. Not this fight.<br />
 Rezzing...this is one thing that clearly defined our class. Verant said NEVER...well that changed.<br />
 Paladins got it much later than us...but then they got our highest prekunark rez before the mid range rez. Though logical in one way-pallies are cleric-warriors, it went against verant's own policies. NERF this? HELL NO. But Verant did mispeak while it did something else. Reasons? Not enough clerics out there to provide exp rez's for everyone who needs it. <br />
Face it, for everyone who needs a rez to get one on time, clerics would be doing nothing at all except rezzing folks full time. Not FUN at all, running nilly willy to make sure others have fun and to minimize their advancement penalties, ehh?<br />
Now we come to Necro's...Yes it carries a huge panalty for someone, but this is a moot point, it is a 90-93% rez. A core cleric ability, yes? <br />
 So that's two classes that got our CORE ability.<br />
 What defines us is US. How we play with the tools and abilities given us. This is one class that we have to really work at to have fun.<br />
 Fact is two classes have our tools too. Many  have overlapping skills and abilities too. Now there is nothing that defines a cleric except our complete healing which takes more than half a cleric's career to get to.<br />
 From top to bottom Cleric's have been infringed upon to make gameplay for others more FUN.<br />
 Now it's our time NO?<br />
 Raising DODGE is one step in the right direction, but it benifits more than just clerics, so Verant will be very recalitriant to this proposal.<br />
 Verant never promised equality, just balance, but I think we've given enough already. We give each and every day and we stoically perserver and go on.<br />
 Being a cleric, makes all of you learn what it's like to be a dwarf each and everyday. Patient. Biding your time. <br />
 So again we must pick our battles and our battlefield.<br />
 Like Sun Tzu said...when on death grounds fight.<br />

ps- I sat and watched one day in Skyfire while two mages and two necros were there powerleveling each other. After 30 minutes one would stand and get sacrificed. The necro's would collect the gem and store it till needed. Smart? yes...perhaps. A PowerGamer's solution to the new ability? yep. It made me wonder two things...can someone sell a sacrificial emerald? Are they tradeable? if so, how much is that gem worth? How much is 93% experience return worth to someone? How much are our rezzes worth?<br />
 Many of us don't charge for a rez, but imagine the uber guild that requires each and every member who can be sacrificed, do so once a level, or once a month so that the guild has enough gems on hand? (I won't get into the PVP server's politics here as they are too profound to be discussed on this board. Here we serve the many and not the few)<br />
<br />
I present the alternative facts and thoughts as a basis to nip the arguements that have been presented before on this board in one way or another.<br />
 We want to have more fun, we want options, we once again want something of our own that defines us as the clerics we are.</div></div><hr />

The pet appears to be useless and would have been alotta fun if done better.  All we get is more of the same stuff.

How are these spells unbalancing?  It's okay to give S Heal, Rez and our high level buffs away to other classes but we can't get some crummy utility spells enjoyed by ALL OTHER CASTING CLASSES?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as invisibility or levitating - why do you need those?  Invisibility isn't much use anymore as 2/3's of the mobs can see through invisibility.  <br />

<br />
Well this ties in to my thoughts on another thread and that being that yes Clerics have been infringed upon or diminished by the sharing of many of our spells with others, yet we did not receive the same blessings of others abilities.<br />
<br />
In my own train of thought a raised dodge would have some use, and yes an increase is actually warranted IMHO in the 50-60 scheme of things ... if not before.<br />
<br />
One other ability that I would personally LOVE to have is bash. Bash is not incredibly powerful, &lt;BUT&gt; sometimes when there is a caster mob bashing may be more effective at mitigating damage than healing strictly. This also gives me a chance now and then to get up and have a melee impact (swinging my mace is not really a melee impact IMHO  .. my time is better spent meditating or throwing 1 DD if I'm FM) But bashing ..yes bashing would have a good impact.  One interrupted spell now and then could have the damage avoidance/mitgation of hundreds of points of damage.<br />
<br />
Many clerics would not get to use bash very often, but on occaison it would be a very nice tool to have, that is my vote for a stance.<br />

Invis is wonderful.  I am tired of running through green zones with my cleric and having greenies aggro.  Yes- I have root and atone, but what a pain! Invis makes it all go away. It becomes a non-issue. As my druid, Shaiel, I go anywhere, basically.  And don't get me started in self-tp, the wonder spells  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

If you really think that you need it, you can buy potions of invisibility from the vendors or from your local shaman that has alchemy skill.  I carry 3 or 4 with me, but seldom have use for them.  When travelling through a zone, I always have root memmed.  If I get attacked by an annoying greenie, I root them and continue on my way.  With the way the pathing works in Kunark, by the time root wears off, I'm far enough away that said mob has decided i'm too far away to pursue and doesn't chase anymore.<br />

Play a night blind race and you will see that there is a huge difference between carrying a lightsource and having infravision.<br />

Here's what the world looks like to a recently dead Erudite wearing a Halo of Light. I wouldn't go so far as to call this &quot;night vision&quot; hehe.<br />

<br />
Increasing dodge?  <br />
If/when I get hit I usually root the mob and let it agro more on the tanks, so the increased dodge may have very little affect, but noteworthy.<br />
<br />
Increasing dodge doesn't seem like it would 'unbalance' things.  Not like Ripostle, or the other warrior skills.<br />
<br />
It's actually a small request I think.<br />
<br />
I for one would rather have some form of self only underwater breathing spell.<br />

<br />
The thing that I wondered about was<br />
if there was some reason to have<br />
a weapon in hand AT ALL.<br />
<br />
Most clerics at higher levels don't<br />
use any weapon at all.<br />
<br />
Now recently we hear of a plane of sky<br />
wep that when procing gives a burst<br />
of mana. Excellent Cleric item<br />
which makes a reason to RP a battle<br />
cleric and makes the group not YELL<br />
at you when you happen to melee for<br />
fun for a few.<br />
<br />
One of the things that others have talked<br />
about is stuff like Double Attack to<br />
improve melee. I didn't think that would<br />
fit with the cleric. I would rather<br />
see a skill like Parry. This would<br />
give a defensive reason to hold<br />
a weapon. And what a cleric needs is<br />
defense more than anything.<br />
<br />
So for lvl 51+ clerics, a skill like<br />
Parry I think would fit nicely.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as invis- Yes there are work-arounds. But that is not the point  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  There are almost always ways to make do. If you had it, you wouldn't have to make do.  You wouldn't have to beg it and hope it doesn't run out at an awkward time.  You wouldn't have to spend hard earned plat ear-marked for other things to buy potions.  You could just cast it.<br />
<br />
Also- not meant to have invis?  Were necro's meant to have Rez?  Post- the patch that gave it to them, yup I guess they were.  Very little is cast in stone.  If Verant were to decide tomorrow to give it, then clerics would  have it.  Will they?  Who the heck knows.  I honestly don't believe Verant even knows.  I think their Vision (TM) is fluid.<br />

&gt;&gt; groups on servers where shamans and druids <br />
&gt;&gt; are more numerous.<br />
<br />
The grass is always greener.... I also play a  shaman character and I can tell you getting into groups can be hard as well. Also even though shaman can heal, a lot of groups don't consider them &quot;healers&quot; (They don't get superior healing until 53 LOL)<br />
<br />

hmmm didn't know that... I always assumed that dumb barbarians,ogres and trolls were the only creates to be able to bash. Lots of things in EQ doesn't make sense...<br />

<br />
How about a skill like &quot;Lay on Hands&quot;<br />
which replenishes Mana instead of health<br />
Maybe even targettable.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it could be tied to a deity<br />
item.<br />
Perhaps only lvl 51+ clerics that complete<br />
initiate quests with their diety get an<br />
item which has a long recast time and can<br />
do +1500mana or something.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the cleric could Lay on Hands<br />
to the enchanter when he was low and<br />
imbrue the chanter with mana. etc.<br />
<br />
Interesting possibilities, and avoids<br />
giving clerics clarity or manastones<br />
directly.  (like they do with shamans<br />
and druids heh)<br />

It is not a true res.  It is more of an exchange of a life from 1 person to another.  The necro has to obtain a special reagent that requires killing another person to obtain this reagent.  From what I've heard the person that willingly dies, is not able to be xp ressed.  Also there is a level limitation placed upon the person accepting the death to provide the stone.  So yes, they do get a res, but it is not nearly as easy as our res.<br />

<br />
Not sure about Druids, but Shaman have a cap of 75 on their dodge as well. Personaly, I feel that both shaman and clerics should have the dodge cap raised to 100. I suppose it would only make since(sp?) to do the same with druids but, honestly, how many higher level druids will ever get close enough to a mob to get hit? (granted I have seen them try, though the mob ALWAYS started a game of smack the halfling).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, as far as shaman go, shaman  have higher caps on their weapon skill. They go to &quot;gasp&quot; 200 where as we clerics go to 175.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ARG thats what I was trying to point out when I said we should have a strike and everyone flamed the hell out of me! I completely agree with you Brodder. We are still the best healers and rezers around, but thats not until higher levels, and trying to get there if we can't group because every other class has our CORE ABILITY really makes things difficult. I didn't know about the Dogde thing, thank you for enlightening me, I was wondering why my dodge skill wasn't raising up anymore. What is tha cap on our attack skill? does anyone know, it really sucks when I hit like 3 times out of 10. If we had a bash before why can't we have that?<br />
In previous posts I suggested abilities based on each clerics Deity. Someone said it would be too much work for verrant to do so I thought maybe abilities for good and evil clerics. Have Bless and Prayer for good ones, Prayer and Curse for evil ones. These are just suggestions, and i've said it many times before, but I know see others that think we need some changes. We doin't need to bitch and whine (I do enough of that for eveyone) but lets get organized, figure out exactly what we want and tell verrant.<br />
Brodder you have my full support on this and I will do whatever is necesarry to help out.</div></div><hr />

We don't need a strike.  We need a well developed plan and have it posted.  But we need to have some hard data added to it.  By just have all or a majority of the cleric not heal or so forth, won't tell verant anything.  We need to approach this matter in the same fashion that Rayne did with ressurection issue.  A post needs to be made with information regarding numbers about defense and so forth and make logical points and then post it and have everybody and their brother/sister bump the thread continuously until it receives the attention it deserves.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, I wholeheartedly agree that clerics should get a skill cap increase in Dodge. We were lumped into the caster category and given the limited Dodge. But we aren't regular casters. We cast heal and we get beat on for it. We also can't stop healing because members of our party will die. <br />
<br />
So we were afforded the maximum armor protection.<br />
<br />
Yet we still get beat on and not even the mightiest warrior relies on him armor alone. The warrior, and all melees, have parry and riposite to deflect their attackers away. And they can dodge quite well.<br />
<br />
Clerics were afforded the Divine Aura and Divine Barrier. This makes the cleric invincible for a short time and allows others to get mobs off the cleric. But often it is still not enough. The Divines have a long recycle time and cannot be relied upon in every combat to anti-taunt mobs off us. This leaves the cleric out in the cold at higher levels. Shamen and Druids can outrun their attackers with SoW and root and while root works well for clerics, no good cleric would leave his/her group in the middle of a fight. So we stay and get beat on and pray our AC keeps us alive. Dodge is practically non-existant at higher levels.<br />
<br />
I would propose 2 ways to do this:<br />
<br />
1. A straight increase in the caps. I'd say 150 would be a nice round number for clerics to have though I'd prefer 200.<br />
<br />
2. A 51+ cap increase per level. This puts our new cap at 125 (or at 175 if they give us 10 points per level) at level 60. Not as thrilled about this one because it gives us a badly needed increase very late in life but still any increase is better than none.<br />
<br />
Bash: This is a losing battle. Verant will not give us a melee skill and even if they did, would we actually be using it? I think better time would be spend raising our 1h blunt cap from 175 to 200, assuming any clerics out there enjoy meleeing.<br />
<br />
Superior Heal: Divine light, Remedy, CH, group CH. Enough said.<br />
<br />
49 res and necro res: Ok, i'm not thrilled paladins get our 49 res. I was fine with them getting the 39 res but what's done is done. I'm tired of being begged for a res and the fact remains that there will always be more 49 clerics than 59 pallys. Period. And we still have the best res. Necro res... maybe some necros are farming exp gems. Fact remains that cleric res will be cheaper and easier to get PLUS no exp loss. Do you honestly believe all those 51+ people beg you for reses so vehemently because they enjoy it? Imagine losing half a bubble in 45. Would you give up a day or 2 of exp JUST so that a necro MIGHT be able to res you later? Very doubtful... But I can see /auction 1k for someone to sacrifice for exp res being seen...<br />
<br />
Lastly, when has SH and Res EVER been our core? CH is our core. It's what makes us high demand. It's what makes us the defining healers in Norrath. <br />
<br />
To put this bluntly STOP WHINING ABOUT RES AND SH.<br />
<br />
There, my 2cp...<br />

But, if there was one change that would make a cleric class rock, it would be either<br />
<br />
A)  Give us a pet that is a little more effective than the current hammer thing.<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
B)  Group teleport to our home temple.<br />
<br />
Considering that Verant gave away our core ability, rez, it seems only fair that we should get something of equal importance to make up for it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wound not be adverse to havnig our defense/dodge skills increased.  I do not find in my ponderings that this will make clerics unduly advantaged or even change the basic balance of our class.  We would simply last a moment longer sgainst that high level mob.  The increasese could be attributable to post 50 so that they come at a time when our defenses are truly staggering in their ineffectivness against 50+ mobs.<br />
<br />
As a secondary item...  I've always been dissappointed in out Yaulp line.  It's a great novelty spell but one that never sees the light of day for the vast majority of cleircs.  I've yet to encounter a cleric over 35 with yaulp loaded into one of our valuable spell slots.  I've played with it on occassion like when I'm hanging out in Unrest just killing time and helping folks and giveing out resses and buffs.  Even in that situation I find it useless as the differential of the buff is low compared to the large disparity between me and the the mobs.  So I would suggest that we clerics get a little 10% or 15% haste added to yaulp.  This would not stack with any other haste spells.  Nest result...  When a cleric tries to melee a blue mob at any point over 30 we'll still get our ases handed to us (grin) but when we beat on greens or goof around cause we're at FM it would make the spell actually worth memming.  perhaps 5% per level of Yaulp.  Anyways, pipe dream I know but that's what it would take for me to ever give this spell a slot in my loadout.<br />
<br />
Also on the useless spells list is the reckless strength line.  Has anyone ever actually used these spells for other than novelty purposes once every 6 months?  A great example of a spell that needs to be revised.  Add in a +attack component.  Reduce the negative effect on str as it fades, but leave duration the same just a slower reduction curve of the buff.  Maybe add a little agility.  Kind of like yaulp for others.<br />
<br />
Hmmm...  other useless spells....<br />
<br />
The hammer series.  I used the first back when the server was about 4 weeks old and I could not afford combine yet.  Other than that...  no use really.  Give it a proc.  Even a tiny pathetic one.  Anything.  Give each one the damage undead proc from 2 spell circles below the hammer.  Heck, even give it spook undead. just something to make it not so abysmially boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting thread.<br />
<br />
I agree that our Dodge cap should be raised, but see no connection with how an increase in Dodge would change our role in a group and thus stem the exodus of clerics due to their &quot;boredom&quot; with that role.<br />
<br />
Self invisibility would be fantastic for travel through aggro green areas (I hate using invis potions to get through the scorpions at Charsis orb, for example)...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the group teleport to home temple...<br />
<br />
Again this is all pipe dream talk, so...<br />
<br />
Just under a year ago some friend of mine and I were sitting around shooting the breeze and I thought up an idea (as many others I believe have come to also think up this idea, in a bizarre way giving it a merit all of it's own) that a &quot;Santcuary&quot; spell that would evac to the cleric's home temple would be excellent for a cleric.<br />
<br />
The discussion was quite entertaining.<br />
<br />
Since it leads to the cleirc's home temple, it would encourage some more role play.  Surely the troll does not want to be part of a group that could evac to Felwithe or Kaladim.  Likewise to the paladin grouped with a dark elf cleric.  It would also put a little more weight to faction in the game.<br />
<br />
Interesting spins on the idea that we kicked around...<br />
<br />
--At least one high level guard from the city of the temple hangs out near the home temple gate in points.  Making sure that those who abuse faction in cities are subject to the results of their actions.<br />
<br />
--The cleirc, in providing this service, dies instantly as the party lands in the home temple.  He gives his life to save his fellows.  Making it a spell that will not be abused for simple gating and thus not infrings upon druids/wizards.<br />
<br />
--Perhaps the cleric would have to be actually bound in the sanctuary room to enable the spell to work.  Thus removing exploit potentials.<br />
<br />
--Since the desire is to provide a type of emergency evac but not to replace druids/wizards, perhaps it uses a component.  The component comes from a minor cleric temple quest and is lore and no-drop.<br />
<br />
Anyways, just a few thoughts that we had when kicking this around way back when.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like your idea for Yaulp but there's a slight problem... Paladins get this spell too (in fact, I think it was given to us just so paladins could have it). Now, imagine if paladins got an inate haste spell. How much yelling and screaming would there be? <br />
<br />
We can hope but I doubt they'd give it to us.<br />
<br />
Just me 2cp...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, lets see... <br />
Dodge would be a nice skill to raise, however I think about the max we could try for is 150. There should be some difference between us and the melee, after all we are still casters. <br />
<br />
Inivs... Verant has our disadvantages as a class that will not have invis or a mana regen spell of any type. Probly pointless to ask for these.<br />
<br />
Necros and pallys... Who cares? Its not like i get jealous when someone else resses the other dead people. And yes, necros do /auc for sacrifice. One was offering 500 per. Sounds pretty good to me. <br />
<br />
I think Broddor and Dalur are right. I hate to complain but yes, we had our uniqueness spread around. And YES we are EXTREMLY boring. We need to choose a reasonable request or two, that dont include Invis or mana regen, support them and send them off to the gameplay board. <br />
<br />
Medtakk... Noone has ever said shamans and druids have an easier time getting groups then us, but generally they are more useful during the low to mid levels since they have all our heals and some other nifty tricks. <br />
<br />
Halo of Light is more then many other classes get. Im pretty happy with it. <br />
<br />
Dekker those are all some form of mana regen, I dont believe it fits our class in any way, and I highly doubt we will get it.<br />
<br />
Ofbac and Gloriels ideas are very interesting. <br />
<br />
I would like some of our buff lines revamped but... Will verant be able to do this? <br />
<br />
I would like to have some kind of other buffs, it would change the job a lil at least. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things I would like to see:<br />
<br />
1)Self invis.  Okay I weighed in on this already.<br />
<br />
2) Improve the pet so that it is truly useful. Although- didn't someone post a guide on getting it to survive longer than 30 sec? Something about making sure it was continuously engaged? So, pull the next mob before the pet is done.  I don't recall if this method required using Death Pact or not.<br />
<br />
3) I am open to some sort of interesting toy spell, like the druid change weather spell.  <br />
<br />
4) How about a succor/evac to home temple :P<br />
Ok- so just a self tp to the home temple so that Leo can pray. This is how he gets his powers, right?  Or so the cleric promo-material reads.<br />
<br />
5) I always thought DA/DB should be skills like LOH. Non-resistable ones at that   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif.<br />
**edit- non-interruptable! non-interruptable**  <br />
<br />
On the topic of skills, where are the unique cleric skills?  Why isn't there one called &quot;pray&quot; that increases mana generation?  Maybe with a one day recycle time or something (see item 4 above.  That prayer as the source of powers always did puzzle me.  Do they mean med?  In which case, all casters do that!!)<br />
<br />
Well, so I ended up on a &quot;brain-storming&quot; note.  Very much out on a limb, but sometimes the best ideas come after you crawl back from that limb.<br />

<br />
On the subject of others getting a class defining spell, clearly Necros have the benefit of this.  Summon corpse and a 93% exp rez (no matter what the cost) swings the scales in their direction [feign death helps alot too, since they may be the only ones left alive in the area after the nastiness is over]<br />
<br />
What about something along the lines of screaming terror - a kind of religious awe that we can mezmerize or stun a particularly nasty mob with so our tanks can taunt it off us.  Id always imagined a spell with a name like 'Enforced Reverence&quot; should do something like this instead of just stun and do damage.  Mobs should grovel on the ground and beg us for forgiveness!!<br />
<br />
I still dodge a bit, but when I get hit for 90+ 3 out of 4 attempts, its mostly a joke.  If I could get missed one or 2 times more....hrmmm that wouldn't be bad at all  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Halo of light requires that an item be removed....i.e losing 16 ac 5 str and 5 wis and 13 sv dis if i choose to wear it over my EM helm.<br />
<br />
Then there is the Glowing Stone Band (i think thats what its called) that can be worn on the ring finger...again, sacrificing 6 wisdom here<br />
<br />
Halo of light is a &quot;corpse run&quot; spell, nothing more IMHO<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for yer posts folks, but please take the time to reread my post. Not because I'm ego-centric, us dwarves are proud, but never vain...(cough cough) anyhooo<br />
 Mana regen...nope Unless we actually got a prayer line that might have random effects that might include a meditation like effect that increased by level? Prayer would have to start at lower levels, all clerics pray, so it would seem.<br />
 Verant mentioned it was looking into the possibilities of a ITEM SINK. This I have proposed before, and I even got a letter from a developer in email..digging around for it now.(praying I saved it and didn't lose it in the eq folder wipe and reinstall last fall)<br />
 The Item sink was called sacrifice...Basically a TITHE like spell. Each cleric gets a 4 slot (any size container) and into this he places 4 items to be sacrificed. (yes this would take a slot in your inventory) This Item itself would be magical and have a combine button relabeled SACRIFICE or DONATE. It could be an URN, A magic box, what ever. Zero Weight item-zero weight container, but items inside would be ones dedicated to their god. <br />
 Downside is that this would provide a 4 slot sero weight container for clerics, I'm thinking it would be used mainly as a half sized box of abukar by many, but so WHAT. That's not the intent, but may be a side effect never the less.<br />
 Items placed into the box could be Sacrificed once a game day for a random reward, item (No rent), Unguent, potion or spell effect. The game engine can indeed see what is destroyed as this is part of game logs for everyone already. Plus the confirmation drop changes imply that this could be done.<br />
 The more powerful the sacrifice-donation-tithe to the church-temple the more powerful the effect. (your god demands even greater and greater sacrifices for thier favors) and yes there is a chance that the gods could still ignore you.<br />
 *Your sacrifice was rejected, your items turn to dust-rot-decay etc*<br />
 Successful?<br />
 *Your God is appeased and rewards you*<br />
 DING-an item appears on your mouse or a spell effect hits you or your party...something long lasting..say 2-3 real time hours (Like +100 vs poison or fire or cold)<br />
 How to make this universal and not only useable by clerics? Place a sacrificial altar or NPC in each temple, and yes for shaman too, even at a certain druid ring. The NPC is empowered to receive 4 items to be consecrated and sacrificed or used by the temple. 4 Rusty weapons might get you faction with the temple, 4 combine swords a long lasting buff, 4 gems something else, sacrifice a piece of CLASS armor...bingo big reward albeit temporary.<br />
 Which is easier for the programmers? Probably the later a NPC in each temple-shaman area. With one shared data-reward table. The game can asign values on items equivalent to what they would sell that item to the public as points...certain amounts of points gets you certain items, buffs, potion-unguents, or a one shot activatable item that can and should be extremely useful to a party. <br />
 Sacrifice 4 of these sacrificial items would be the cookie effect...you sacrifice 4 no rents and get one permanent item...maybe.<br />
<br />
 All this is a nice idea, but agian it spells work and should be offered to VERANT separetly from any other proposed changes to Clerics.<br />
 If offered to verant it should include a twist to make it lean to, slighted too, clerics and other priests. You must have highest faction in your temple for this to work. Yes some clerics and paladins espescially have access to many different temples at highest faction. (I&quot;m maxed at elves-dwarves-humans(FP and Qeynos).<br />
 Penalties should be given for using the temple's altars as trash compactors (2 rat pelts, a rusty weapon, and a skunk gland...I think not...curse thee *ding* loss of faction)<br />
<br />
<br />
 Okay now back to main thread... <br />
<br />
 DODGE UP= we are all okay with this. If so we should make the case for Druids and Shaman too. We aren't casters and since Shaman were said to be more barbaric they justified their higher combat skill caps. Okay shaman have 200 combat skills...let that be. Include them or exclude them in the request on this basis might seem trite. <br />
 If we make a case we should base it off the HYBRIDS alone and not pure sets of each class. <br />
 On one hand Verant's logic tree suggests that the Healers are a class of their own, then again they share many limitations of other classes. <br />
 Hybrids were adjusted against melees to make em more (cough) balanced and groupeable, even though they were meant to be measured against the healer classes.<br />
 So If not A and not B it must be C?<br />
 Not so by Verant logic, it seems to apply as neccessary to force classes into niches they see in the &quot;Vision&quot;.<br />
 That is our may opponent in any quest we as clerics would endeavor to pursue, yes a quest folks. For it is a near insurmountable task to get a positive change for clerics or any class.<br />
 THE BOARDS ARE CHANGING so as a class we must post, succintly and logically, no what ifs, but a solid post with solid reasoning and solutions and OPTIONS.<br />

Then, it went on to postulate that other classes were attributed cleric spells to increase the overall game's fun for most players (ie, paladins getting resurrection).  The general theme of the message(s) appeared to be that clerics should stand up to a new issue to improve our fun to alleviate players boredom factors.<br />
<br />
I am sorry, but Dodge skill has nothing to do with being bored.  I in no way can envision Riffi being any less bored by having more Dodging ability.  Riffi dodges about once per week as it is when he is in combat.  Increasing it, even doubling the skill, to twice per week would in no way improve his boredom factor one iota.<br />
<br />
If a poster is going to argue that we as clerics are bored, then please, don't spout that Dodge will be our savior.  It simply won't.<br />

I respect Brodder and his intention, but the argument is misplaced and won't fly, at least for me.<br />

Nice try but I'm sorry I don't like the item sacrifice idea.  It is far to pagan for my tastes.  Tithing is one thing, making a sacrifice is beginning to infringe to much on real life.  Yes, I realize this is just a game.<br />
<br />
P.S. I don't approve of the necro sacrifice spell either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OPTIONS contd...<br />
<br />
 OKAY if we all agree to pursue DODGE CAP increase, or perhaps a SHIELD skill(parry but call it different) what would be the benifits?<br />
  MOBS MISS MORE= less healing, less interuptions, better for the party and gaming fun overall.(add your thoughts on this here and on other points too- enumerate them please)<br />
  DOWNSIDE- MOBS MISS MORE, LESS MANA USED, PLAYERS LEVEL FASTER. <br />
<br />
A NPC that is trying to hit a cleric who just healed and misses more isn't attacking someone else during that round. A definite plus all around. Then again missing more might make em angrier? Who knows what's in the core code?<br />
 A MOB_01 says, &quot;DAMN YOU HALFLING STND STILL SO I CAN REND YOUR BONES!&quot;<br />
 A MOB_01 goes beserk on poor cleric halfling until Tank can taunt or it dies or more likely the cleric is pasted.<br />
<br />
 DOWNSIZE if only clerics get this increase? RANGERS crying about their dodge cap. I myself think they should have similar cap as Paladins or SKs.<br />
<br />
 HOW TO IMPLEMENT this change? TWO WAYS...(add more here folks as ye see fit)<br />
 GLOBAL CHANGE- A Quest to visit and get training from a well known Battle Cleric (COUGH COUGH) in the ARTS of DEFENSE. Folks everywhere would seek out this Dwarf ;-)<br />
for battle training. He and only he could train you point by point in the higher arts of DODGE/PARRY. Quest would be set for 34+ the point at which most clerics have maxed their dodge skills. Can a quest be hardcoded this way? I don't know. Can a skill be given as a reward ?<br />
 Imagine DWARVEN BATTLE FRENZY- ALL BEER CONSUMED (Hit button like LOH or a spell icon) You fight as a NPC your level for duration, and ummm friends or groupmates may become targets too due to faction considerations. <br />
 Dwarf Cleric XX casts a spell.<br />
 Dwarf Cleric feels a Battle rage enter him.<br />
 Dwarven Cleric XX whacks Mob Y two dozen times in a row.<br />
 Mob Y dies horribly.<br />
 Dwarf Cleric XX fails Bezerk Check.<br />
 Dwarf Cleric XX says, &quot;DARK ELVES LIKE YOU REALLY PULL MY BEARD. PREPARE TO DIE SPAWN OF  INNORUK!!&quot;<br />
 Dwarf Cleric lays into groupmate Z, said dark elf.<br />
 Party members consider putting Dwdarf Cleric XX Down for their safety.<br />
 POST BEZERK-Dwarf cleric is drained and weak. Akin to Rez effects. Or very dead.<br />
<br />
 Okay not doable with this game engine, but definitely something funny to think about.<br />
<br />
 Another Idea I had was something akin to a sacrifce self spell. Call it ENNUI. Giving of the ALL from self. A revelation, a ennui, is a force that takes its power from the caster.  It takes ALL remaining Mana and 99% of the health, and maybe also leaves the caster weak  like a post rez effect.<br />
 The results would be horrendous to the area near the cleric and any targeted mob.<br />
 A Cleric with 200 wisdom, 2000+ mana, and 2000 Health could sacrifice ALLOT. Charge em a death penalty for the use of this spell.<br />
 What would be the effects of a ENNUI? GAME ALTERING I'm Sure. This would definitely be a 50+ spell, with chances of eradicating the mob targeted. But would the experience, the rez effect and, loss of health and mana be worth it? Probably in the right situation.<br />
 A cleric would in effect become a Land Based Death Seeking Nuclear device.<br />
 Scary ehh?<br />
<br />

 DODGE is  battle we should fight for now.<br />
 The FUN factor is separate entirely from this. The Fun factors I have been posting on bit by bit through out the post.<br />
 As for sacrificing items getting to some folks, well PAGAN is a title placed on other religions by another. If that worried you so much, then wizards and necros should appal(sp) you.<br />
 It's a game, let's try to keep our personal views out of the religious aspects of the game, it's a fantasy world and anything can go and often does, as long as it's withing Verant's vision neh? ;-)<br />
<br />
 Okay once again DODGE is probably the battle we can win to make us more effective and survive more. HOW, and why is what we need to work out. The rest is fluff and ideas for consideration for making the game a bit more fun for us all.<br />
<br />
Should we open a new thread and cut and paste from this one ideas that would make clerics more fun for CLERICS?<br />
 What would be fun for one may not be fun for others. So how do we get a consensus on this? We post ideas and refine them.<br />
 We're clerics, we have the patience, neh?<br />
<br />
 Random carpet idea bombing until we can refine the ideas and we can produce a laser guided fun-seeking  missile...(UMM no jokes there folks, I can see that some will giggle at this phrasing, I know I am, but what the hell)<br />
<br />
 So before we (And I) polute this thread till it loses cohesiveness with random postings and I spend too much time posting and not playing.<br />
 Could someoen comb this post for FUN ideas and repost in another thread&gt;?<br />
 SOmeone post the dodge numbers for the classes involved in a table...rangers, SKs, Paladins, Shaman, druids and of course us.<br />
 Then lets tackle that issue...on that thread...this one can be closed as an opening shot and awareness awakening post.<br />
 Then on each post (FUN and DODGE individually) we can tackle the issues with minimal overlap.<br />

<br />
But I want to bring up something that was mentioned once and forgotten, that of giving the clerics BASH when wearing a shield.<br />
<br />
My god, I have been fighting with a shield for almost 52 levels. you think I haven't figured out how to do a shield hook ro a bash by now? It is a combat skill that a cleric would have picked up. and honestly, I think we can make a stronger case for it than increasing dodge.<br />
<br />
As to the Halo of Light issue - there ARE items that can be obtained. You just need to determine if the trade off is worth it. I play a human vicar of Mithaniel Marr. It is a tradeoff that I get for being human.<br />

That in itself is not bad because clerics rarely get hit(relatively speaking of course compared to say a tank).  I don't think that there would be any real benefit and it would be a serious waste of time to go to great lengths to push for this.  Once your past say level 25, if your going to get aggro'd on hard by whatever, chances are dodging one hit isn't going to safe your life.  Even at my level, dodging a 150 point hit isn't crucial..<br />
<br />
I love being a cleric..even after 100+ levels of being one(several clerics over time) I have never really gotten bored with the class.  I think our spell series are great, even though some get very minimal use(lull series, DD against summoned, invigor). <br />
<br />
I do wish for things that make repetitive tasks less tedious like getting a group buff series the following spell circle after getting it..  i.e. you get valor at 34..at level 39 you should get group valor.  same with our AC/symbol/resist series of spells.  Even if it wasn't any more mana efficient than casting it 6 times..just the fact that I don't have to cast it 6 times would make me a lot happier.  <br />
<br />
Mana regen? bah I never really had an issue with that..especially after about level 35 when you almost always have clarity on you.  Face it, most of the time your going to be doing boring xp camps that are &quot;safe&quot; because most people don't like risky areas and you'll rarely fall below 80% mana except in the most dire of situations(break in, bad pulls, etc).  I like it when I'm hurting for mana, that means I really get to put my skills to the test..seeing how efficient I can be etc.<br />
<br />
About DA/DB not being interruptable, I agree that would be nice especially since Paladin's LOH isn't interruptable now I don't see this request as being unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Self invis? bah just go buy potion at 15pp a pop big deal.<br />
<br />
The pet..no comment at the moment but I do think it is _too_ weak even for us.<br />
<br />
Also a new item called a potion of insight, effect: clarity.  not sure where they drop or if they do in number but they exist.<br />
<br />
And to verify, I sacrificed myself the other day for a guild necro to have a stone for an emergency..basically you die with no chance of getting that xp back..  I wish there was a global message noting your sacrifice though.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like your impetus to urge us to improve our Dodge skill.  Facetiously, I tease my groupmates with comments when Riffi actually dodges an attack.  It honestly happens about once per week:  &quot;Whooooaaa!  I actually dodged!&quot;<br />
<br />
If clerics were really tanking, then dodge would be an important skill, but honestly, it is never a factor in anything Riffi does.  Since this game truly does not have &quot;Battle Clerics&quot; in the way the game was designed, I am not sure this is a fight we should take to Verant.<br />
<br />
Yes, dodge is a fine skill and having it improved would be nice.  But no, it will make no impact in our lives as clerics.<br />
<br />
So, while at heart I agree with your view and would like it to be increased, I am not eager to make a big deal of it on the &quot;official&quot; EQ boards.  In the end, even if it were improved, it would not improve our functionality in any measureable way.<br />
<br />
My opinion, only.<br />

I hardly ever have time to see whether I dodge something or not and if I did, what difference would it make? Also Verant would most likely argue that they would have to increase the cap for everyone with the same low cap or something such and it then becomes much easier to leave it as it is. Particularly as it wont change the user experience hardly anything.<br />
<br />
I think that Ofbacs proposal of a group evac spell to the Cleric's temple sounded really neat, but it sounds like it might be too involved to be realistic.<br />
<br />
Giving a 50+ cleric bash sounds like an interesting idea though. Particularly as we stun a lot as it is and it would give a cleric something to do in a fight. Rather than just watching health bars and throwing in the odd stunn. Clerics started their lives meleeing and I think that it would be nice being able to take out the sheild and the mace from time to time and at least look like we are doing the business.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kleitus</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure (not %100 though since the numbers I had were for just before Kunark was released and might have changed a little bit here and there) that all of the hybrids have the same Dodge cap of 155.  Rangers fall short in Riposte, Parry and Defense after level 50, but not Dodge.  There's no explanation for the Riposte/Parry caps on Rangers, the Defensive one is to keep them from having the same AC as Paladins and SK's, who aren't allowed to have the same AC as warriors (a holdover from the questable class armors -- all the plate wearing classes should have similar AC's but Verant decided there were different levels of plate when they needed to buff the warriors instead of giving the warriors some new abilities), thus the Rangers suffered the most out of the hybrids in the end(oddly enough, I think they have higher Dodge and Parry skills before 50 but get passed sometime afterwards).<br />
<br />
You can get whatever increase you want in Dodge, the truth is though that it won't do a damn bit of good.  Dodge is a very ineffective skill and the reason is that they gave Monks a really high Dodge cap and then decided it was silly for high level monks to never get hit because they were always dodging (I don't remember exactly how they said it in a post once, but that was the gist of it), so they lowered it's effects sometime in Beta or shortly afterwards.  I doubt you'd notice much of a difference if you had the same Dodge skill as a hybrid.  I wouldn't worry about going after parry and reposte either, they're just marginally more beneficial than dodge.  I think one of the high level rangers was told that increasing dodge/parry/reposte wouldn't help them a bit with their defensive problems - this was at the last gathering or whatever and it was supposedly GZ and someone else (a programmer) that said this.<br />
<br />
I think what you need to ask yourselves, is do you want this to count as one of the upgrades that Verant and other players will cite and use against you in the future for something more worthwhile.<br />
<br />
You can take a look at the following link (hopefully it works).  Just remember that some of the numbers are wrong (just as an example, I don't think paladin archery ever goes above 75 whereas its listed here as going up to 175 after lvl 50.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the idea of making DA and DB into skills. First, clerics have plenty of space for new skills, seeing as we get zero class-specific skills of the type one presses the hotkey to activate. Second, having two extra free spell slots can increase our options a lot and provide for new flexibility to the cleric. Right now we don't have a heck of a lot of choice as far as the spells we load - generally 2 heals, 2 divines, DD, root, stun; which leaves basically one spell slot for flexible purposes. The inflexibility of our spell lineup is I think one of the major causes of cleric burnout.<br />
<br />
Another thing I favor is the encouragement of more diety-specific items and quests. Ideally each diety will lend its strengths to the clerics that follow them; say a slight bonus to DD for clerics of Innoruuk (hate); more effective fear spells for Cazic (fear) worshippers; effective bonus to CHA on Atone and Lull line for followers of Quellious (the tranquil); etcetra for all the clerical dieties. Even if the abilities are mostly token, it still helps to make you something other than just a_cleric00.<br />
<br />
Ah yes I almost forgot - Atone! Word has it that Atone looses effectiveness against higher level (45+) mobs. This spell is a major key to our crowd control role (one of the things we can do besides med/heal boredom) and should either retain its effectiveness against higher level mobs or have an upgrade available.<br />
<br />
The other things on my list would be discarding useless spells, even if the replacements were only marginally useful. My #1 suggestion on this is to get rid of the tremor spells and replace them with a Curse line of spells which could have any number of negative effects (or even a random negative effect) on the target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a couple more ideas:<br />
<br />
Bless ability: once per day you can place a special blessing upon a single character; it will last the full game day and give a slight AC and ATK bonus (just a few points) to the target. What a great way to give a little extra advantage to your main tank, and not unbalancing at all if the magnitude of the effect is small.<br />
<br />
Fire-based DD: Big problem for cleric is that EVERYTHING we have is magic-based. In the D&amp;D rules from which all modern fantasy gaming has grown, cleric damage spells were all fire-based. This way we wouldn't be so totally impotent against mobs with special high MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A11e</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think clerics should get some form of cannibalize (the level 24 shaman spell).  This spell doesn't generate a tremendous amount of mana but it helps.  I often have an excess of HPs and very little mana.  This would help to even things out a bit.  <br />
<br />
For me, the most boring part of being a cleric is constantly not having enough mana to even cast a stun.  All I can do is sit and watch my mana bar slowly creep to the right.<br />
<br />
Give clerics cannibalize.  I think a good name for the cleric versio would be something like &quot;fasting&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact choosing something that IMHO trivializes many more important issues we could choose to take a standpoint on.<br />
<br />
*Most* of the time I am sitting and stand now and then to heal, raising dodge would have an incredibly minimal impact and I dont think a passive skill like this is what many of us are looking for.<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying to step up and take initative but I don't support this effort myself for the reasons stated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gee, thanks Badina. Do you ever say anything positive? Honestly, I'm tired of all the whining. Whineplay is gone but it's memory lives on in the hearts of people...<br />
<br />
Is Dodge going to make the clerics as exciting as druids or warriors or... *insert classname*? No. In fact, if you want to be as exciting as *insert classname* why don't you go play a *insert classname*?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you find being a cleric so boring. But we have never, nor will we ever be a class that other people will point at and say &quot;Boy! That's exciting!&quot; We were made to be primary healers and, quite honestly, do you think we do anything different from other casters? They all sit down and med too. The ONLY difference between us and them is that they actively attack and get those nice yellow messages while we heal the others. We get no nice messages nor do we get any credit. All we ever get is the tanks screaming &quot;HEAL ME&quot; when you're 3/4 through CH.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boredom&quot; is not a class problem, it's a perspective problem. All classes can be boring and, conversely, they can be exciting as well. I enjoy playing my cleric and I, for one, am not going to waste my time on some vague campaign to fix what some perceive as our &quot;problem&quot;. <br />
<br />
I take great offense when people say all we are is heal, med, heal. The only difference between a cleric is the word nuke instead of med stuck in there.<br />
<br />
Everyone wants something different. Casters wanna melee, melees wanna cast and hybrids want respect and less of a penalty for being a hybrid. But honestly, do clerics NEED to melee better? Would Bash really solve our problems? It would be something different from what we once were but it wouldn't make us &quot;exciting&quot;. Maybe we could dual wield and cast Ice Comet. Would that be exciting enough for you?<br />
<br />
Dodge has an excitement factor of 0. In fact, you probably won't see much a difference. What we're really after here is a piece of the balance pie. We get beat on. A lot. A HELLA LOT. It would be nice to have a realistic chance of dodging even one attack (which doesn't happen often now as-is). But it would IMPROVE us, even if that improvement is only minute. Bash is a losing battle, more and better nukes is a losing battle, even better melee is probably a losing battle, but dodge has a chance of winning because it doesn't change us all that much.<br />
<br />
Do you see our point? Or was I too boring...<br />

And if you think there are better causes, speak your mind, tell us what those are.<br />
<br />
Now, on to the topic at hand.  If they increased dodge, I would say &quot;cool, doesn't make that much of a difference, but whatever.&quot;  If they gave us bash, it would be an interesting change, I think its one of the better ideas out there.  I personally think they should give us better health regen spells,(do we get any at all?) or bump the usefulness of some of the more useless spells, like the hammer line or the Yaulp line.  I think they could easily increase the Yaulp line, and make things more interesting for the cleric who swings his/her mace once in a while.  I know, I know, &quot;Most clerics don't even have a weapon wielded at higher levels!&quot;  Or make Yaulp able to be cast on others.  Short term buff, why not.  <br />
