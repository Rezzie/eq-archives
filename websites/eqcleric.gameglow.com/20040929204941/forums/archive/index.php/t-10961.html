<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-14-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was just Lord Bob, but hey, it was the first time we've taken a real hard hitting, unslowable mob (the other night when I tanked Ytarr unslowed doesn't count =P). Yea us =).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've been dissecting the fight this morning and noted his dps which came to 365 on our 60 Warrior (with defensive of course).  I'm wondering how 365 dps compares to other larger mobs.  Namely I'm thinking of Velketor, Vindi, and others of that ilk.  Of course I've read the threads on this board (although I may have missed something relevant).  I'm interested in computing our healing/dps requirements ahead of time.<br />
<br />
I figure Bob had about 50k hit points.  I've read that Velk has 100k or so.  I've noted our dps, how much mana we had left (used 2 Clerics last night, could get a 3rd if need be), etc.  We didn't have a Mage last night which is another problem we can rectify.  Biggest problem we have is the 16 characters we had there were being run by 7 people, 2 of whom were running one.  We do sometimes have a bit of lag getting people into action =P.<br />
<br />
Any info you could provide would be appreciated =).  While I'm all for trying things out for ourselves, my server is not real forgiving for failure.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Doesn't compare to Velk or Vindi by a long shot however. I'd try Wuoshi then Zlandicar if I were you, both are easier than the ones you mentioned. Velk hits for 850, not sure on Vindi but he hits hard and fast and can tear you a new one if you aren't properly prepared. If it helps any I can give you the lowest numbers I've done them with... Wuoshi 16, Zland 17, Vindi 20. Wuoshi can probably be done by a single group if they are uber enough, I'm sure we could do him with 12 fairly easily. Velk drops such crap that he isn't worth the effort imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badany</div><div class="date">06-14-2002, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dojo isn't even an uber mob imho.  Dojo is done by one group in our guild, and we are far from an uber guild on our server.<br />
<br />
We have done Velkator, Vindicator, Rublecrush, Doomshade, Servitor, Va'dyn, and Dozekar as the most difficult mobs we have taken.  Also: Vernil Senthir, Chardok Queen, Talendor, Sev, Trak, Wushoshi, Kolek Dar, and probably a few others I've forgotten.<br />
<br />
Velkator is the first &quot;uber&quot; mob test imho, at least in Velious.  Although we haven't tried him since the upgrades to NPC casters.  I don't know how much more difficult he got.<br />
<br />
Previously, the tactic for Velkator was to NOT mana drain him.  Amazingly, he does (or used to before caster upgrades) less spell damage then melee damage.  As long as he was casting spells, he is cake.<br />
<br />
I don't know where Zlandicar is in the list of uber mobs.  Unfortunately we have never won the race to find him up yet   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Take a look at our News for what we have done, and our roster for who we have done it:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-14-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the replies.  We didn't find &quot;Lord Bob&quot; to be particularly difficult either.  Of the 16 we had 4 went LD 1 minute into the fight and a few others clearly weren't needed.  Our Warrior isn't very big so we did need the two Clerics, although I think a lot of the healing was wasted.  I'm still waiting to see the tank's log.<br />
<br />
I consider him an uber mainly because although he is comparatively easy, he is also has all the characteristics of the &quot;Velious uber mob&quot;: unslowable, hard hitting, and more than 32k hit points (that was a big deal back in the day).  When we last tried him a year ago (right before we left EQ for AO) he owned us pretty well; got him to 1/2 before we bit it.  Although we were a lot weaker back then (no ToV armor, no AA points, no 60 Warrior, etc) it was still nice to go in and drop him without a death.  It also gives us a lot of data to chew upon.  Most mobs we fight don't do 300+ dps =P.<br />
<br />
I'd really like to do Zlandicar, but been waiting on our Rogue twinks to hit 60 as that's the best defense against AE fear.  He does AE fear right?  Unfortunately Zland is also rather contested on our server - we have way too many 60s for our population, hardly a unique complaint I know.  Also, since Zland is slowable that makes him a totally different fight than Lord Bob or Velk.  We have a pretty set strategy for slowable mobs: the SK taunts like crazy and everyone else goes all out for damage.  The AEs might make it interesting, but aggro control isn't an issue.  Lord Bob was a big deal for us as it was the first time we tackled a mob that the SK just could not deal with.  I (SK) split off his guards last night and I have no doubt at all I couldn't effectively tank him.<br />
<br />
If anyone has logs of any of the &quot;lesser&quot; mobs (e.g. Velks, Vindi, Zland, etc) damage output or dps on defensive/non defensive tanks I'd love to see them.  Otherwise I guess we'll find out the hard way =).<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />
Rayne</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lord Bob is harder than VaDyn imho - VaDyn is just a long boring fight.<br />

<br />
A couple of comments don't worry to much about the &quot;wasted healing&quot; of your MT.  Play around with ch timing though.  Basically you need it timed for the worst possible round against your tank.  As an example on burrower fight avg CH landed only healed about 1100-1500hp on a defensive warrior (looks like a waste of healing) until you see in the log biggest CH landed for 6250hp or so.<br />
<br />
Second Badany - I'm surprised you list servitor in with Rumblecrush, Vindi, etc...he's not even on the same difficulty level.  Serv is slowable and single groupable.  To bad he only really has one nice item.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Israfel</div><div class="date">06-17-2002, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if you could take Velketor, but he's practically always up (I'm on your server ;&gt;). Certainly an easy CR, if nothing else.<br />
<br />
Additionally I'd be paying more attention to burst damage ouput over a 5-10 second period is, not averaged DPS. DPS-wise I can tank the Nexus Scion, but in actually it wouldn't work out for more than a few rounds -- the NPC only needs to get lucky once :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">06-18-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd strongly suggest next raid to have every log out and check their Datarate.txt file and make sure its set to at least 7.0 (if on modem, and 9.0 (or higher, depending on which thread you read) for cable/dsl.  I'm still suprised to see how many people don't know about this MUST DO if your raiding.<br />
<br />
As for uber mobs dmg/sec, it really depends on a lot of things.  Top mobs like AoW have 2000+ dps to a non defensive warrior.  Vindicator is an excellent practice mob, with his 8 hour spawn time, he is usually up, and camping in the arena while practicing is a great source of armor.  If you can kill him then you can also kill Velk and your one step closer too killing Zland, Kland, Tormax, and Statue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that I've thought about it some more, I think a great thing for you to try would be to take your crew into ToV and try your luck in HoT. Skyshrine armor is probably as good a loot as you can find at your level of development, and rather plentiful at that. It'll probably be a load of fun too, and you can do it anytime you wish. It will also challenge every aspect of your teamwork and be a good practice area if you do plan on taking on mobs like Zland, Wuoshi, or Klandicar. The named in HoT should definitely be within your ability, other than perhaps Dozekar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-19-2002, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip Smegal.  We just have one player who runs four characters over dial up (amazing it works as well as it does).  Was just bad timing and luckily it didn't affect us. He set his datarate file to 7.0 a few months ago; the rest of us run at 9.<br />
<br />
Good point about Vindi; I'm sure we'll try him &quot;soon&quot;.  We have no illusions about mobs like AoW =).  There's a mob I'm currently watching very hard for respawn.  He's no challenge (slowable), but does drop very nice items =).  <br />
<br />
As far as Thurg quest armor goes, nah =).  None of us feel like farming gems twice.  We were farming HoT before we quit a year ago and we go now every other week or so.  Our main tanks just need BPs so Clerics are now up for plate drops.  I am wondering though if we should clear the entire wing before going back to the beginning.  On our last trip we killed the two entry guards, the wanderers, the entire north side, three more wanderers (they were respawning) and a few from the south side before returning to the first mob on the north.  Seems like it wouldn't matter, but drops were &quot;really bad&quot; the last time we went.  Our Rogues have gained a few more levels (all 56+ now - were 53/54 last time) so it should go a tad faster.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions<br />
Rayne</div></div><hr />
