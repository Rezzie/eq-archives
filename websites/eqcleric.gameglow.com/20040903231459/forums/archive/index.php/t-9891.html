It irks me!  I dont know about you, but I always seem to be lucky enough to get some good chanters in my groups, and having a regular chanter makes you know how to play well with them - ie Stun the monsters, atone the monster if the chanter has mezzed it in multiple fights etc etc.  The key to this is (IMO) being able to see the chanter and the mobs!<br />
<br />
I mean, I like to sit down where I can keep the whole field of a battle in my view - usually a corner.<br />
<br />
There is nothing more annoying than sitting down, then having some tall elven wizard sit on me so I can only see the back of their head!<br />
<br />
Is it because I usually pick the best place to sit?  Because Im a (non-bearded!) female dorf and they like sitting on me?  I mean really!<br />
<br />
Anyway thats my pet peeve!  Just wondering if i'm a raving looney or if anyone else gets this.<br />

As a dwarf I can't ever see squat.  People wonder why I often have my nose pointed into the wall.  Well, I for one almost exclusively use the camera view where it follows behind and above you.  First then I get to see my pretty armor, but most important I can see a heck of a lot bettter.  Especially useful for seeing things whacking on your backside.  In tight dungeons it takes some well trained zooming and moving the camera up and down, but still it takes care of all those ogres blocking your view.  The only time I use first person is for swimming around in Kedge Keep.  Navigating the z axis with anything other than mouse look is a pain.</div></div><hr />
