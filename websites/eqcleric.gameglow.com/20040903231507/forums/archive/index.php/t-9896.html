<br />
Its got by far the best 1hand blunt ratio we can use.  Its got very good +wis, even if you are already at 200 wis you can drop other +wis items for resists, HP, AC,and Mana items.  Its got killer +mana, that never hurts.  Nice sta for hit points.  Charisma for pacifies, atones, cheaper peridot, maybe not the best stat but not that bad. The effect is amazingly useful in a large raid after a wipe out, anyone who has ever spent time trying to kill any new dragon knows how long a total wipe out can take to recover, this helps a lot.  Frankly what would you expect here?  A 110 point fire based DD proc like Pallies?  A self only haste clickable effect?   It may not be Group Marzin with no regent but it still rocks in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Bottom Line: The cleric FA is everything I expected and more.  I'm very happy with it.<br />

Look at the other options for our melee hand.  Paw, Kedge totem, those dorky 1hb's from Kunark, Dawnfire, that stupid ice cream cone.  None of those have anything on this.  Its basically handing you the option of getting higher ac (hello ac/hp rings) and more mana through other items.<br />
<br />
Yeah, its delay sucks.  Ditch that Girdle for a FBSS and get in there and make all that new camping work out for you!  Thats 50 damage you could be doing, each swing! That could add up.<br />
