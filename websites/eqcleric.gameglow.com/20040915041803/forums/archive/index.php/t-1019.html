<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llumis</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in Kaesora last night(again) and I started a superior heal on the main tank.  Well, so did the other cleric in the group.  Then one of the mobs REALLY started hammering on the mage.  I interrupted my own spell by ducking, but it still needed to finish before I could cast again.  This led to wasted time, and an very nearly dead mage.  <br />
<br />
I personally think that casters should be able to &quot;cancel&quot; their casting midstream.  This way, there would be less confusion with multiple healers, and, in the case of things like CH, one would be able to cancel the spell if the tank was going down too fast, and cast a remedy or two.  There may be drawbacks to this, or features of it that people could exploit, but Im not sure what they would be.  <br />
<br />
What do you all think? <br />

I think this was addressed once and Abashi or Gordon or somebody stated that they weren't going to fix it for whatever rediculous reason.<br />

Usually unless dragon fights it never seemed a problem, I just hated Ch'ing guys vs Trak and then they die 2 secs earlier.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brokk</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sure would be nice though to be able to stop casting on on your tank and start casting on your enchanter that is getting owned.  As for Trak..  I have used CH Divine Light Word of Vigor and Word Of Restoration and think that a combination of all is definatly best because at 900 mana word of restoration seems to eat my mana pool pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kronnin</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not sure if this was a bug or what...but the other day i logged in and started summoning some food and drink. Mid cast in one of em i decided i wanted to look at my inventory and hit the I key. For some reason it swithced to my inventory screen and stopped my cast. I didnt think about it much but then did it again two casts later. <br />
<br />
So i says to myself hey wait a minute that'd be great if i could do that during combat. So i tried it with sheal. DOH!! it didnt work. Tried it again with abundant drink..and it worked. <br />
<br />
Not really useful, but maybe it works on certain types of spells? ill have to test it out some more(didnt have time then cause we were fighting in the arena in fp against some celestial tomb members). <br />
<br />
What a blast that is! to anyone suffering from burnout..try to organize some pvp deals between friends in the arenas. Total different strategy and lotsa fun too. Caution: this does not work for kewl d33ds who want only to lvl and get exp. <br />
<br />
Got off track there sorry  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
