<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaladark D'Kaladim</div><div class="date">01-17-2000, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know of a cleric on my server (prexus) who did the grueling Babbinshot watch and got his first pair of Gauntlets of the Arident, then traded them for a Mithril Breastplate (he actually had the stomach to do it again and get a pair he uses)<br />
Anyway, the Mithril BP is about equal to 2 rmb's and a mammoth cloak, so you might be able to get the trade.<br />
<br />
Here's the kicker.<br />
You have 24 hours to do it.<br />
<br />
You're ability to get a trade worthy of the current difficulty of the quest relies on your ability to find a high level cleric with items to spare who doesn't know that these thigs are going to become a lot easier to get, and thus a lot less valuable soon.<br />
<br />
So, post on your server board, get a druid or wizzy friend to warp to every spot he can and do an impressive auction for those babies, because when the clock strikes 7 am (or whenever they do the patching wednesday) your carriage will turn into a pumpkin, and your gloves into an easily obtainable item.<br />
<br />
You can do it, given the current difficulty of the quest, they are worth it.<br />
<br />
You just need to find the right cleric (one who is desperate, rich, and doesn't know about the quest adjustments coming up)<br />

<br />
This was intended to be a reply to the post &quot;Trade value of Gauntlets of the Ardent&quot; but I hit the wrong button...<br />

<br />
The last I knew, Verant had acknowledged that there was a problem with the Cleric armour quests, that they were going to fix it, but that the task involved a lot of work and they were unsure on when the fix would be implemented.<br />
<br />
With the problems that they have with server overcrowding since the Christmas Holidays, I would hazard to guess that we wouldn’t be seeing a fix any time soon.<br />
<br />
I also have a feeling that in many cases, while the quests will have a more reliable outcome, they are going to make sure that they are still long hard and boring.  In fact I have a feeling that they are going to make it almost impossible to just (Luck) into a quest item, you will need to complete a long and arduous quest like the Stein of Mogguk.<br />
<br />
But please let me know if I have missed something, I did a quick check on the EQ Stratics news and didn’t see a thing about a patch.<br />

I would definately prefer that (if it wasn't for the faction thing making it impossible) to what we have now...at least we'd get to DO something.</div></div><hr />
