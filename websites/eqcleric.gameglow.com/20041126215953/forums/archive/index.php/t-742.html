<br />
I remember being 19 and posting to this forum about where to hunt. Got several wonderful suggestions of areas- I don't recall them but I am sure the search engine would find it.  <br />
<br />
The reason I posted a separate message was to empathize- been there too http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  Some ideas, which you probably tried, but let me field them anyways:<br />
<br />
1) Team up with a warrior. This will take a while, but start approaching warriors in the zone and ask via tell. I found one at about level 14 that took me to 32, and we were an awesome pair.  At 19 we were in oasis and we zoomed along experience-wise.<br />
<br />
2) Keep a list of people that you group with. Especially those that you like.  On logging in, start searching for them and sending tells. ie- build your own group.  Keep a list of their alts as well.<br />
<br />
3) Approach existing groups and ask if a level 19 cleric would be of help.  If they say no, then stand and watch. Heal as necessary.  I have been invited into groups who say &quot;he deserves it, he helped.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am really a very shy person. These were very hard things for me to do.  But they do work.<br />
<br />
Best wishes, and good luck<br />

I have a full time job and can only play a few hours a week, sometimes I will go a full day on sunday or something. All of my friends are now high 20's low 30's. <br />
As for warriors there seems to ba an extreme lack of warriors near my level on prexus. The norm I have found is 13 and under. I saw one that was a 17 SK the other day but he was busy.<br />
I sit and heal groups all the time, but they have a druid so they don't need me, &quot;I will take away from exp cause they have too many in the group already&quot; is the usual response or &quot;already have a healer&quot; <br />
I even had one get mad at me one day for helping out.<br />
I usually spend most of my time trying to find a group, then I get frustrated and go into Befallen to solo what I can. I'm at an in between level now where I can't go into the basement because it's to hard and the upstairs doesn't give me much experience.<br />
I'm am being perfectly honest when I say that I get in a group 3 in 10 times that I play. Alot of times I get so bored I just go wandering or talk to my guild who are either very low levels 9 and under or 27 and up. Actually one guy is a 14 bard so he will catch up in a bit.<br />
I've tried soloing in Unrest and those stinkin beetles make it so hard. Even gone into Kithicore during the day but died a few times so I stopped that http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Last night I went into South Ro for the first time, I here that is a good place to solo for a cleric so I'm gonna try that for a while.<br />
A guild mate told me to go to the Lake of Ill Omen at 20. She was my level about 3 weeks ago, now she is 34.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzin</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">S.Ro will be good for you, break out sense the dead and go as ghouls and DB's will be good exp for you. However, if you can get to Kunark now, do not wait on 20 to go to ill omen. If you go to the FV zone, follow the stream to the lake, and hang a left, you will be able to find plenty to hunt. My suggestion is to beef up your ac a bit, and head here. Hunt and of the skellies you see (though lesser charbones my be a bit much, use caution), sabertooth tigress' (avoid the tigers, they start at level 18 and hit hard, good for a level 22 or so) and goblin battle masters. Pull to the lake, as it is relativly safe from roamers, or, there are a couple of safe spots on the zone wall here. Good luck with your hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">my ac is 400 and somthing unbuffed, is this good for that zone? My wis is also 151, which is very high for my level I know, so I usually have a decent amount of mana on me at all times. Tonight I'm working on getting alot of money, 1kp to be exact, I'm gonna buy a Knobbed Warclub 8/24 and +3 wis. So that should help me a bit http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzin</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, if you have any slots (baring your face, it you have a ruby veil, and I might even consider that piece too, if you do not need the str) that do not have ac on them, change out your armor a bit for the ac items. For solo purposes, I found that, at that level, loosing more than 1 ac per wis gained, was not a good trade off. Other than that, you sound good to go. One word of warning, the mobs here hit fast, so try to save a root to give your self a head start. The key to Kunark is, if you can get far enough away from a mob, they will stop chasing you. If you can get this to happen, zone or log out to clear the hate list, then go back to hunting. I seem to remeber that my ac was 450ish(I think) while here, with my wis being 124.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your mentioning of that warclub reminded me of something, Aean - Kurn's Tower.<br />
<br />
Some of the mobs should be blue to you at 19 - though I'm not sure on that.  AllaKhazam lists it as levels 10-25, so you might be in luck.  The tower is filled with undead and Burynai.  There were few wanderers that I found when I scouted the place, and invis to undead works fine against the skeletons.  It could be a good place to solo, or find a group with some young Iksar...<br />
<br />
But more interesting is that's where the very nice Iksar Berserker Club drops, apparently down in the tower basement.  A 7/18 weapon, +4 wis, and procs Fleeting Fury.  I've gotta get one myself for those times when I feel the need to hit things - I find mobs don't take me seriously when I attempt to club them with my spirit tome  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Just a thought...<br />

I work full time too, as well as am married, with two teenaged kids. So I share the account with several other people.  One thing I have had to do is dis-engage my NEED to keep up with people.  I am sort of competitive, so that was hard. The early friends I made are in their 50's and many have quit the game.  Many have made alts and I play with their alts.<br />
<br />
It is interesting that you are on Prexus- my husband's mage (Camecho) is on Prexus, as is the bard I just started to play with him (Cygnet). I think my daughter has a druid too (Adrion).  None are in your range at this point, but Camecho(36 mage) levels slowly because he shares the account with me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I frankly push everyone off when I get home from work and have done my evening chores.  Keep an eye out for them.<br />
<br />
I remember around 19 being a lowish point.  By 20, I discovered high hold keep and wizzed along there.  Then had a low period. Found outside paw, and advanced quickly.  Nother low... well, you get my point  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
BTW- I think a lot of people swear by Lake Rathe.  I don't know how this is for cleric's soloing.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aquinas</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suesc is right -- don't worry about keeping up with the Joneses.  There will always be a subset of players who can play for hours a day and zoom through the levels.  Also, be aware that you're going through one of two tough level ranges for clerics (19-23 and 29-33) where druids and shamen can heal almost as well as you can.<br />
<br />
I would also recommend Lake of Ill Omen as a hunting ground.  I didn't go there until 22, but I had a great experience through 28, and rarely had trouble finding a group.  I posted a few recommendations about the zone here:<br />

The levels 19 thru 24 really stink as do the 29 through 34 levels.  My advice would be to solo through level 19 to 24 at Oasis.  Granted its pack 95% of the time and stuff is sometimes hard to find, but it definitely beats walking into a zone and shouting for hours that you are looking for a group.  Some of the suggestion of remembering who you have grouped with in the past and giving them tells when you are online are also good suggestions.<br />

<br />
Aviak city or Outside Paws should be great places for your level. From 20 to 30.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't go into Kurn's Tower basement solo; you'll have your ass handed to you quickly =(.  There are &quot;some&quot; undead in the basement, but it's mostly various Buryani.  A lot of those are Necros and SKs and, well, they can be nasty.  You won't be getting one at a time always either.  I was commonly Darkened and Diseased and I was usually HT'd once every other pull of 3.<br />
<br />
It was a GREAT spot for my SK at those levels, but then he had Rayne right behind him for backup =).  Spent 5 levels there, never saw a warclub.  Actually, the loot totally sucked there, but XP wise it was incredible.  Now a trio of people would really rock down there.<br />
<br />
You might consider tooling around Warslilk's too once in the low 20s.  Very underutilized zone.  Otherwise, Lake of Ill Omen is the Kunarkian Oasis, complete with the non-sensical /OOCs =P.<br />

Hang in there.  Eventually you'll get to the point where you get an invite to go to umpteen different zones the minute you log on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I was hunting in South Ro and teamed up with a 17 necro. We were rockin the house! in about an hour my partner had leveled to 18 and I gained about a bubble and 1/8. We were in that little temple sticking out of the ground hunting dry bones and crypt mummies. Orbretl spawned and my partner had just cast his spell to start attacking a mummy and that agroed orbretl who started chasing after him and killed him, there was nothing I could do http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif But a high level bard came and killed orbretl for me so now I have 3 components for the fright forged helm http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif now all I need is Basalt Drake Scales and a whole lot of factioning http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif anyone know which zone basalt drakes are in?<br />
I think I am gonna stay in south ro until 20, then go over to kunark. It's gonna be my first time over there http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif I already have a last name picked out too http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
woohoo bye bye damage cap!! http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

I did oasis 9-16, lake till 20, trees till 24, dalnir up to my current lvl (27). ITs all about making friends, grouping with people you know, having people invite you places (hell I had a friend who invited me to partner with him at lvl 9 in oasis, when he was lvl 13. All about aquaintences.<br />
<br />
Of corse its better with low pop servers, hehe. Bigger ones tend to be more impersonal cause of all the peeps.<br />

I seem to recall somewhere in 21-24 was when I could easily do single ghouls, and lurking mummies.  Was great solo experience when I couldn't find a group.</div></div><hr />
