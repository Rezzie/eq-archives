</FONT><HR>I'm afraid after reading the first page of the thread that I didn't see anything eloquent.  All I saw was another rant.<P>I had to disagree with Albrecht from the start.  Clerics are hero's.  He made the first assumption that hero's have to be the person that puts in the killing blow and that's just not true.  There are every day examples of hero's, people who go out of their way in the daily regular grind to do something for someone else.  Clerics are the epitome of that.<P>The 'clerics are boring' message is really just a symptom of the problem of burn out.  It's not the actual problem.  It takes so long to get up to these new levels that a LOT of people who aren't clerics are also burnt out.  It's not the class.<P><BR>Eirienne Kindheart<BR>Faith and Flame, The Tribunal Server<BR>Templar of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Yea I have to agree with the first reply.<P>1. Clerics aren't the ones to slay the bad guys. If you thought a lot before choosing to play a cleric, you were aware of this. Alas we are the people that make slaying ubermobs possible. Lack of ANY other class is acceptable, but to do it without clerics you'd have to have a really interesting composition (not to mention you'd be stupid risking a lot of exp with no resses inc).<BR>2. Boredom is speaking. I'm well aware cleric isn't the most interesting class, but then again, what do you define as interesting. With a _LOT_ of experience I can tell you that for example planes suck unless you're in the lead/puller group. Class won't help you.<BR>3. Class matters little. Would you find it really exciting to chase monsters around all the time never going afk as a melee? Esp as pure melee you'd have nothing else to do really. As wizard... lol you think clerics do the sit down and cast one spell a lot?  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  Enchanter is different, but not all that much more interesting (I've played a high level one, wasn't particularly interesting or difficult). Pet casters... hmm yeah, you think you might be badass, but its /pet attack and /cast x pretty much for them. Except ubermobs where they're basically there to give DMF and summon corpse or whatnot. Damn that must be SO cool and interesting instead of buffing up a lot of people and trying to keep 6 people alive to KILL the mob.<P>What I'm trying to say here:<BR>If you think clerics are boring, tell me about a class that isn't if you look at it in a pessimistic way. I'll give 1000pp on rodcet nife to the one that tells me a class which I can't define as boring just like the burned out people are defining cleric boring.<P>Raids come down to who you are. If you lead the raid it is hectic at best... otherwise its gonna be somewhat boring, class nonwithtanding.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>He didn't say that clerics weren't heroes, but that they aren't heroes in the traditional sense of fantasy literature.

Oh, the glory!"<P>Freedom from a night spent staring at the spellbook is what was asked for, and I support that wholly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I do not know if it is safe to say that over time a person becomes bored with every EQ class they focus on.  However, I do think that is the case for some people.  I also know it is the case if you pick a class that does not fit your idea of fun.<P>I have played three classes pretty deep (paladin 47, shaman 52, monk 53).  I can tell you that at some point they all became painfully boring.  Recently, I started a cleric.  Because the class is new to me and I've been able to level up pretty fast, I find the class fascinating.  I never even think of logging on the other characters.<P>Eventually I will be very bored by being a cleric and may go back to playing one of the other characters or start a new one.  Something that I have found is that it is very easy to level a character quickly so I do not mind putting one on the shelf.  I also have much, much, much less real life time in them than I did in my first character.  After the first go-around you know where the big exp spots are and if you want, you can deck out the character 40 levels better then he/she should be.<P>To a lot of people this is not the answer but to me, when I get bored I switch gears 100% to another character.  And trust me that all classes CAN get very old.<P>Machia mentions a monk specifically.  Despite the fact that I have 2 other characters nearly the same level as my monk and have a cleric approaching fast, had I stayed playing the monk (my first character) and never started another one I am certain he would not be anywhere near 60.  It was so boring for me that I found less and less reason to play.<p>[This message has been edited by Hainx V'Lorok (edited 10-09-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>ACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>I can not believe what I am hearing!  I have played three characters to respectable levels, but as most may or may not know, I LOVE MY CLERIC! But for Pete's sake people there is some truth in what Albreicht has said.  <P>Hero thing aside (Frankly who cares about that and I think he was just adding some flare to an otherwise straight foward post)  So please no more dwelling on that fact! Lets get to the meat of the post. Clerics can, in a normal situation, be the MOST redundant boring class to play.  Heal, med, Heal, med rinse repeat.  Hell I have played other games while in a "steady group mode" (defined as: when you chilling with a group and chance of death is slim, basically because everything is down to a science; however, all would change if you were not sitting on your arse and medding between heals!!!).  *shrug*  I am not saying that its all BAD, but jeeze just one more little demention for fun would be nice.<P>When is healing exciting.... When your about to be wiped out and you are basicaly striving to keep people alive.  That's when my heart races and I truly love my cleric, however with the gameplay of EQ being so technical these days, those time arive few and far between.  When you have a good group and a good planed RAID, thats just the way things go. So the question is what to do when things are just in that "Steady Group Mode"?<P>I do not know the answer, without affecting "class balance".  As clerics we are Healers, we all know that, and we do our jobs more effeciently than any other class out there.  But that does not mean becuase we are "balanced" we deserve to be truly one dementional.  And trust me we are.  Some may argue thats just "burn out" speaking, but it is not.  My other two characters are a Warrior, and a Necromancer.  Well necromancer aside (necros are just fun), hell a warrior has much more to do than just be a meat shield.  It is thrill trying to pull a mob off a trigger happy caster, its fun to pull, its fun to collect all sort of different weapons to bash the sh*t out of things.<P>Its a fine line and I am not here to offer a definative answer.  But life will go on either way and I will still play my cleric.  But to dismiss the fact that clerics are NOT one dementional is, in my eyes, is wrong. How do we fix that?  Well not sure if you can, but would be nice.  Lets post some ideas...

</FONT><HR>  I was about to reply when I read Sobe's comments which mirror mine a lot.<P>  The problem with the Cleric class IMHO is that we are too ONE DIMENSIONAL when grouped.<P>  It is not just a problem for the higher levels. At levels 19-24 and 29-34, I have been turned away from groups because I am ONLY a healer. A druid or shaman can heal just as well and their buffs are pretty useful too. I think my undivided attention to the group's health is better, but I can't transport people to the vendors when they become encumbered. I can stun though  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>   From what I have read, at the higher levels, we become healing and ressing 'machines'. At level 31 I am seeing this more and there is not much fun in that. If it wasn't for the joking and group chat....<P>  If Verant gave us more abilities (fun) than we would become too powerful. I agree with this. We have a lot going for us. <P>   Albrecht mentioned a 'fire and forget' DOT  type of heal that would free us from healing temporarily so that we could do other things.  This is a great idea. What other things?  How about a 'Heal Shield' like the druid's damage shields.  We could recieve them in the same levels the druids do and they will heal XX HP to the wearer each time they are hit.  This buff should be short-lived just like the druids damage shields. I guess we would have to stand up more (whether the group liked it or not) just to keep passing out that 25 second buff on the tanks. <P>   There are other abilities and spells that Clerics could recieve without affecting balance.  Here is how-   Set the healing ability/mana ratio so that it is about the same as we have now. We won't heal better but  we will have more options depending on the situation.  We can spend our time trying different strategies and techniques (like druids did with kiting).  Not more powerful, just more flexible....   I think this is the key to making Clerics something other than healing 'machines'.<P>   What other spells/abilities can we add to our one-dimensional class without effecting balance?  <P>   Verant won't listen until we have a solution that works.<P>Sam       <P>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The comment about the heart pounding, really tight, scary fights where you just manage to win is really true.

</FONT><HR>No "class" can be a hero. The person is the hero. <P>As with anything like this, its purely subjective. But the game has changed dramatically since Kunark such that clerical heroes are few and far between. <P>On rodcet nife, many people recognized one particular old guy as having the most impact on our server. This guy was a cleric, he was also what some people might have considered a hero. He retired early and became a Head GM on another server named Saviente. <P>Nowadays, post-Kunark, I think the simple virtue of playing a cleric to 60 is enough to call yourself a hero. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004442&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004442&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
