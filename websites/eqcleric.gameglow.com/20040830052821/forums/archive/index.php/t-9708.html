<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunik</div><div class="date">11-08-1999, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Saturday (11/13/99) I logged into unrest at 6am the zone had 18 people.  I joined with a group and we started by pulling from the house.  Well we decided that when the zone had 35 people we would attempt to camp the Knight room.  Well we managed to capture the Knight Room and then shouted out the fact in the zone.  <br />
<br />
A few minutes later the bar room gets camped and that report is shouted.  Well our group managed to hold the Knight Room for 8 hours without a death.  Members came and went but we held the room.  (Sad thing is that the Knight spawned only once but I did gain three bubbles)  I kept the party fully buffed at all times with Bravey, Spirit, endure magic, and Symbol on the tanks.  I used the trick I learned here that when my buffs start to blink I buff myself then the entire party.  That way I always know when buffing is needed.  (Everyone was rather impressed that I always &quot;knew&quot; when to rebuff them...hehehe)   Well after 8 hours we lost control of room and had to zone.  <br />
<br />
We reformed  (five of us) under the leadership a 2nd cleric (level 31) named Katz (a very twinked cleric - I first encountered him at level 16 and he had all the same stuff -- you know the cleric dream list).  Well we retake the Knight room.  <br />
We all med up and wham up pops a greater dark bone and werebat.  Well we are doing pretty good then wham two Hags appear.  Our tank starts getting hit by Hags.  I turn and start blasting a Hag.  I see the tank's HP dropping fast and attempt to get a Heal off ... but I was too late and he died while I was casting.<br />
<br />
Well we all had to zone.  The tank of course is pissed (i.e. I would be to in his shoes..two clerics level 26 and 31 and not 1 heal was cast on him).  Well the bad part is that Katz then started telling me how to be a cleric .... I mean we are talking a lecture.  He ranted all about how clerics only heal and not nuke.  Well I ask?  How many heals did you cast?  No answer.  I was mad I had kept a party alive for 8 hours in that room and then this twinked guy trys to tell me how to be a cleric.  <br />
<br />
I feel that since he was twinked since birth basically he has not learned the art of being a cleric.  I guess I should pity him.<br />

You will be training the basement on all the newbies at the zone  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif or &amp;gt; http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
