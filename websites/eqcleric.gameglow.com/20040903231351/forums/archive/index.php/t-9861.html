<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">06-20-2000, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't believe it.  I was grouped in frenzy all day long, when we call in a troll warrior, who I'll name George.  George was a nice troll, whom had a lot of hitpoints, which I knew to begin with, him being a troll and all, so I went ahead and buffed him with pinzarn/valor/aof just to get the full effects of complete heal.  He even felt it was needed to describe the benefits of using only complete heal on him.<br />
<br />
Okay, I can deal with that.<br />
<br />
First Big pull<br />
He pulls 3 froggies including the bloodthirsty.  I told him that I'd start healing at 30%, but since he was taking damage pretty quickly against the BT I started complete heal at 40% (mind you he had at this point in time 2400hps) which is about 1400hps, not bad, still pretty mana efficient, hit him when he hit 20%, which means he had 1920hps left, not bad, saved myself a ton of mana.  He did the no-no, once he hit 30% (btw, the second I start casting I announce HEALING GEORGE FULL just so no one panics and all non-warriors can step in and take some damage or step back in case) and he started screaming Heal me! Heal me! Grrr.  Shrug it off, continue medding and refuse rez requests in Befallen.<br />
<br />
Second Big Pull, or the sentinel stops by for tea.<br />
<br />
This time, I started healing at 40% again since I told him I will not start healing until I am sure that he is okay to take it, or I will use s-heal.  He was taking so much damage, that when the heal hit home, he was at 20%, my intended target.  Again, the &quot;healllllllllll meeeee&quot; comes over the group speak, which I reply with my hotkey &quot;kick! hit! kill! maim! wait for your heal, because if you die we all die, and that ain't a happenin'!!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point he says to bring in the 54th level necro, and with all classes over 50 I get squat for experience, and I was only there for experience (well, not like I'd turn down a fbss, but I have the standard cleric lotto luck, meaning all bad), so we get the necro, and at 7/8 of a bubble from 44 and all the fun spells, I get (in 1.25 hours) NO exp whatsoever, as opposed to the .75-1 bubble that I would get.<br />
<br />
Okie dokie, I'll stay for a fbss or ring, I could use the ring for a wizzie friend of mine....<br />
<br />
Big pull number 3, Hello Frenzied, Goodbye Machia<br />
<br />
Frenzied stops by, hitting hard and fast, but doesn't have a sash (tease....=P) Same deal, start at 40%, warn group of casting, 2 seconds before its done casting I get the call of HEALLL MEE HEALLL MEE to which I replied, clearly upset, &quot;I AM HEALING YOU&quot; and he's completely healed before I can even type that out.  It hit him at 20%.<br />
<br />
I promptly told them that I was sick of being told how to do my job, that if he didn't trust me to heal him that I simply wasn't going to trust him to protect the enchanter, and that I would wait for the cleric to replace me, and I gated out when she arrived, angry, upset, annoyed, and perfectly unhappy that I had to leave a camp where I was getting perfectly fine experience, and even enough fs and gold that no one wanted to barely be able to refill my pack of jaspers.<br />
<br />
Oh, and he demanded pinzarn after I told the group that I was running low and only the ones that absolutely needed it, enchanter, bard, and myself, were going to get it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and no he didn't pay me, or supply me jaspers after I said I wasn't going to buff him with it unless he supplied his on, yet still insisted.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the length, just upset that I am 1/2 a bubble away (later went back to try to hit 44, but group fell apart after I got there) and fairly hacked that people insist that they can do my job better.<br />
<br />
Oh, and someone said they wanted a rant =)<br />

&quot;Have rez, will travel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Here, I'll pull my mace out mister warrior if you want to start healing!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sobchak Billdozer</div><div class="date">06-28-2000, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beautifully said and illustrated.  I have no problem w/people asking me how I operate.  In fact, even just since I got Supe heal, I'll tell people when I join them, &quot;I'm not going to heal until at least 3 bubbles have gone by.  (I may even wait longer if it's one of those 'got to have every scrap of mana' pulls   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif )&quot;  Even so, I'll hear &quot;Heal, Heal, HEAL!&quot; All too soon.  <br />
I play on a network here at home.  3 of us linked together (on a 56K no less!  C'mon DSL...) so quite often it'll be a 34th druid, 35th shaman or warr, and me newly 35.  And I still hear &quot;Heal him Sobchak&quot; from one of my roomates.  (Or better yet &quot;You weren't healing him, so I had to.&quot; Listen druid-woman, I heal BETTER than you! I do NOTHING but look at health bars ALL day! heh)<br />
So I can only imagine how frustrating it was for you friend.  I love your hot-button reply.  now that is a kick-ass idea!<br />
<br />
Oh, boy that rant stuff DOES feel better.  I love grouping w/my roomies.  We're a great team, and best of all....no typing!  But geez, let ME do MY job.  I trust you to do yours....<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time,<br />

35th bertox (and finally getting to see the world around him....So that's what a battle looks like?  I'd read about it....)<br />
