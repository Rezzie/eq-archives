At first I thought this would be a minor problem, just something you'd have to do to finish off the quest. No, no.<br />
<br />
I spent the ENTIRE night trying to track down an enchanter to do this for me. What is such a big deal ? Sure it costs some mana and med time. I offer payment, buffs, heals so they can stone it back, whatever they want and it's not good enough. And I checked, Enchant plat costs less mana than a xp res.<br />
<br />
It will give me great personal pleasure to reply to an enchanter requesting a res,&quot;You have any IDEA how much mana that is?&quot;. I can't wait.<br />

<br />
enchanter01 tells you,'I don't have much time, you have any idea how much mana that takes?'<br />
<br />
/tell enchanter01 Ummm, yeah, 600 mana to enchant both bars. Thats almost half as much mana as the resurrect and buffs I gave you yesterday.<br />
<br />
enchanter01 tells you, 'Yah, but I gave you clarity.'<br />
<br />
/tell enchanter01 Yah, thats what, 75 mana? Look, don't bug me for resurrects in the future, I'll go ask enchanter02.<br />
<br />
enchanter01 tells you, 'Hey, finished what I was doing, where did you want to meet?'<br />
