<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just trying to find some corrolation in difficulty between Va`Dyn in Akehva and some Velious mobs like Vindi, VtS, Doze. Working on strats for my guild (I prefer not to go &quot;cookie cutter&quot; and get a step-by-step method from someone else-every guild is different, anyway =) and just want a rough idea about relative difficulties-did Va`Dyn this weekend with about 23 people, 4 clerics (3 on CHeal rotation that eventualy got knocked down to 13 sec+ delay, one on spot heals) and we really weren't 100% ready for him when he got pulled-was a long distance agro add or some craziness, but we did it with minimal death (three when he first showed up before we got agro on the MA, two at end do to lag/enrage) so it was a great confidence builder for my guild-Lord Bob was the only other post-Kunark big mob we had done before this (I've been telling them for months we were ready, but /shrug-fear of the unknown I guess =) Honestly, the 8 adds/repops we had during the fight were harder than Va`Dyn himself-&lt;3 enchanters.<br />
<br />
So, naturally, we want to build on that success, and I'm just wondering roughly how our strats will need to be tweaked to compenstate for the differences, so was looking for things like mob HP, damage output, etc. Any info would be most appreciated.<br />

His melee is just too low for that. <br />
<br />
Anyway - go try Velketor to see for yourself - atleast bring the 4 clerics and 23 people though for your first time - and another 10 people wouldnt hurt at all.<br />

Best of luck<br />

Even slowed, he was doubling for 350-525 every second, and flurrying for triples and quads every 5 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
Biggest thing I'm wondering is if the insane high damage mitigation and HP of a Luclin mob like Va`Dyn (one nuker put 5K in about 10 seconds into him and his HP bar didn't even move, hits for around 10 damage were the norm for level 60 epic monks, tanks and rogues) which leads to an insanely long fight will be roughly equivalent in effort to dealing with a higher damage, but lesser (even if that's relative due to AC/mitigation on the Luclin mobs) HP mobs (which would result in quicker fights) or are we talking about an entirely differnt ball game?<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know of a decent log parser? I want to get a rough idea of how many HP Va`Dyn actually did have, but the parsers I have only show damage I personally did.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Va Dyn is not a hard fight at all but it's an extremely LONG fight.  I think that the best I've done him with was with about 14 people.  In all honesty, a CH rotation isn't needed here because his damage is pathetic when he's slow.  However, he's a very good test Mob.  If you want to work on a CH Rotation and get your Clerics some practice, do it with him since the fight is long and it will give you an idea of what to expect with other encounters.<br />
<br />
I have no idea about how powerful your Guild is but Lord Bob is also a good fight to practice Main Tanking and CH Rotations on.  He Flurries so you can get an idea of some large output.<br />
<br />
After that, go for Vindi.  Odds are you will not win your first, second or even third try but Vindi is an EXCELLENT mob to really see what high end Velious/Luclin mobs can do.  Just make sure you have plenty of Clerics, and fill the rest of the raid force out and go for it.  He takes practice but once you get the tactics down, it will make future raids much easier since you have an idea of the mentality behind such fights.<br />

<br />
The reason a long fight vs a low dmg mob is easier than a short hectic fight is simply that the only risk is falling asleep or running out of mana - compare to a fight where the tank can actually die and you have to scramble to heal the next tank while he has to try to get aggro before the mob tears up too many of your damage dealers. <br />
<br />
The margin of error is just alot larger on a long fight vs a low dmg mob than a short(er) fight vs a high damage mob. Combine high dmg and long fight for the truly rough times  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Just consider that if the mob cannot kill someone in less than 12 sec you can actually react to them taking aggro and start a CH - but if they kill in 6 sec you have to start healing before they get hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seethur<br />
<br />
It seems you are on a personal crusade against CH rotations. I apologise if I missed the post where you detailed how to keep the same very low risk vs mobs with a high melee output so could you please point me to it as I am definitely open to new suggestions on how to heal tanks with near zero risk of error vs anything from Vindi to AoW.<br />

Why oh why does everyone insist on a heal rotation and the dumbing down of the cleric class =(<br />
<br />
Because VI insists on making mobs that can do more damage than a tank has HP in 10 seconds and fights that last longer than a cleric (or group of them) can keep a tank alive using heals other than CHeal without going OOM. I agree it sucks, but its the system that is broken, not (all) of the people using it.<br />
<br />
We've done Lord Bob already, everyone agreed he was pretty much a joke. Hell, not too long ago a single group did Bob, and they were far from uber...there might have been two pieces of NToV gear amongst them and one primal, with a healthy smattering of SS armor. Took um a couple tries to get him, but they eventually did it.<br />
<br />
So, if I'm understanding, Vindi will basically be the exact opposite of the VaDyn fight? Low HP/high damage as opposed to high HP/low damage?<br />
<br />
Should be intersting....we're planning on trying him this week sometime if we can find him up on one of our raid days. I'm assuming on a 1400AC/5000HPish MA we should be going for about a 2-3 second cycle?<br />

<br />
For the first fight its better to lose because you go oom than because you healed to slowly and the tank died - so by all means heal fast to get some data to work with.<br />
<br />
Another difference is that Vindi rampages - so be prepared for that. Rampage is definitely worse than flurry - /rude quad Creator/IV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">04-09-2002, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know mikar, rampage if you deal with it, makes the damage output alot steadier on the MT.<br />
<br />
From the limited experence in ST, a tank can recieve anywhere between 20 and 80% hp loss in 10seconds pre slowed simply because of flurries.<br />
<br />
Rampage however is more of a worry about cleric safety rather than MT safety.  Its a trade off really.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I would put vindi as much more difficult than the statue overall.  Out of the 3 easy chain mobs, of velks vindi and statue, vindi is the most tricky (of course quad statue is harder pre slow but that don't happen for long).  Velks can get tough near the end if you take too long, he spends most of the first bit of the fight trying to nuke, and when he forgets to nuke his dps really increases.<br />
<br />
Vindi is a good test mob purely because he is always up, so you can have alot of practice at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have done vadynn with 12 people (that included;  2 clerics lvl 60, shaman 60, rogue 58, warrior 60, ranger 60, 2 wizard 59 &amp; 60, enchanter 60, pally 60, monk 60) with vadynn, slowed me and the other cleric swapped the healing between us and while one of us was healing the other was medding. we even got one add in the fight and no deaths.<br />
<br />
and we even tried letting pally(60) tank him(well we didnt have any warriors online at the time) and we got him down with 14 peeps and no deaths, but of course that required more healing, had 2 clerics and one druid.<br />
<br />
So IMO Vadynn is very easy if the people are awake and know what they are doing.  Im certain he is doable with one group  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Tank uses defense and once healed you only need 1 cleric and good mana regen. Remember to slow often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We fought Va`Dyn in the corridor straight out from the zone in and past the fallen pillar.  The Warrior used /disc Defensive, Shaman Slowed, the Enchanter kept spawns mezzed while I completely healed the Warrior.  The fight lasted a good 20 minutes, it was long enough for defensive to be reactived about halfway through the fight to give you an indication.  It took FOREVER and I, honestly, never want to do it again.  Yeah we did it with a skeleton crew but the battle took so long it kind of sucked.  No one was ever in any danger of dying and I was bored out of my mind.<br />

That's my stab at it... so to speak.    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Doom gives us fits for some reason.<br />
<br />
Good luck getting to Doze, there's a guild currently pretty much monopolizing him on our server.  Very aggressive and unwilling to share him.  I think/hope my guild is going to give him a miss.  We're not interested in fighting over spawns and getting locked into endlessly doing those quests.<br />

VtS dropped for us last night, first kill for GotK. And I've been pushing hard enough for Rhag that hopefully we'll be doing him soon (we just started using class reps/raid leaders and I got nominated for cleric rep-we'll see if that carries any weight as far as what raids we do-hehe).<br />
<br />
And yeah, I've seen some of the fallout on that Doze thing, ah well, they gotta finish SOME day-LOL.<br />
