I did the lonely spec from 43-44, but I'm wondering if Happ is better XP.  <br />

Decent loot, good exp, easy mobs, near zone lines and a city, plus you build faction. In addition, an excellent way to start shawl quests if you haven't or plan on it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ejkas</div><div class="date">03-20-2002, 12:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Happ Dremblenod is a mid 30 female gnome. She spawns at the little gnome outpost place near the steamfront zone in Lesser Faydark. She has been and is a favorite solo target. About 1000 hp, no faction hit. Breaking can be tricky, she is a mage, and has a pet. Once you kill her once though you can pull her before she can cast her pet spell. I never did solo her, as I said I prefered soloing giants in GD/EW followed by the wyverns and drakes of cobalt scar. So I cannot say if at level 42 the other gnomes assist her, but I would imagine it depends on your level and faction. Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeneb</div><div class="date">03-20-2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Happ and specs are essentially the same level?  Neither will give particularly more or less xp?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Saying this though, they do have a level range to them where as Haap is the same level every time.<br />
Also Haap is FAR easier to kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javara</div><div class="date">03-21-2002, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did both off and on in the mid 40's.<br />
<br />
I think the Specs have a &quot;little&quot; better exp, but also are harder to kill. They do have a little loot also at least. And if the spec is camped you can still solo the troll guards in Rathe Mts or look for a hg group.<br />
<br />
Happ's plus for me was that she was never camped, was an easy kill, and being a high elf I could work on the Tunare neck piece quest.</div></div><hr />

I just cant remember thier names. Seems to me they are a Shammie and a SK and are guarding a idol or something. They are in the area North of the Hill Giant area and South of the part were the zone ot Lake Rathe is.<br />

Sorry this is not very detailed.<br />

*Edit: Just check my EQAtlas Map. They are in camp 10. Loc is about 1500 1700. It is due West of Ankh's Alter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javara</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly what Andav said.  They pull single, one is a shaman. She was easy to kill. The other is a SK and soloable but harder, a little more risky. Nice thing is if you want you can partner with someone and take both of them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LoshannaGhoulslayer</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As the others stated a 44 pally and a 40 cleric own them. Druid and pally have a harder time in doing it. Cleric and Enchanter own them also. Beware I have seen a wandering named ogre near there making 3. The third one owned the pally. Drop midocre cash i think it average 9 plat in gold and small coin for 30 minutes. They dropped Fine steel. Beware of druids kitting here seems to be a favorite spot for them to get others killed. Hope this helps.<br />
44 pally = blue and yellow 40% of time red and yellow 30% blue blue 30%<br />
40 cleric most were yellow/red<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeneb</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting... anyone have a particular strategy for doing this as a solo 44 cleric?  I read a shammy's guide to them, but it involved DoTing a lot.  I assume I'll need to roo the shammy, then blast away  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  But are there other things I should be doing as well?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javara</div><div class="date">03-27-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When doing the shaman I personally would stand aways back on the hill to the south and pull with a nuke. Shaman and pet would come running, I'd root shaman and back off, fear pet, finish nuking shaman. Pet would depop when fear wore off and its master was dead. <br />
<br />
Sometimes I'd throw stuns in there when the shaman was casting but generally the Shamans spells were easy to resist, or it would heal it self a very small amount.  The shaman doesn't hit to hard either so not to many intterupts.<br />
<br />
Next pop just pull before it summons a pet.  6 min timer.<br />
<br />
I know I did it at 45, think I did at 44 also.<br />

<br />
I have messed around with both in my early and mid 40s.  Happ is much easier than spectres - not only does she stay put and not roam about to find friends, but you can med without being interrupted by marsh bears and skellingtons every few minutes.<br />
<br />
However, Equestrielle the corrupted does path near the Gnome camp, so you have to be attentive enough to run to the Steamfont zone before she can keel you.  She is a mean horsie.<br />
<br />
I find both forms of soloing dreadfully boring, but will do them when having a semi-afk kind of a day.  You will get much better experience and much more fun grouping with friends and hunting things that are faster paced.  Droga was greening out by 45, unfortunately, but you might try getting together a group and heading to City of Mist or grouping up and going to Howling Stones or many of the Luclin dungeons.<br />

I've been doing giants in GD the last few days, since I won the roll on boots in Kael  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  Thanks all.<br />
