<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shandara</div><div class="date">01-17-2000, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't wait for the 30's to head into Cazic, go at about level 23-24. I went in at 23 and made 6 levels in about 20 hours of play time (2 weeks for me). You'll want a courtyard group of mid-20s until you hit 26. The loot is good with fs weapons dropped often. <br />
<br />
Healers are in high demand, even during peak hours. During off-peak hours, when there are few people in the zone, you might have trouble getting a group. But rathe mountains are right next door and you can start soloing giant skeletons at 24 if you are careful.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 26ish, you can start grouping for the lower throne room. There are two named lizzies here, the Templar and the Diviner. The Templar drops the lizzie cloak and ravenscale armor. The Diviner drops the lizzie mantle and more ravenscale.<br />
<br />
The mantle isn't that great, but does offer wis bonuses. It sells for about 50-75p on Tarew Marr. The lizzie cloak is nice. I picked up two and the one I sold fetched 500p which was a nice start towards my ruby-plat veil. The ravenscale is rogue only armor and can get you some good trades. One rs bracer traded for a serp bracer, which my druid hubby loves =)<br />
<br />
At 28, you can start grouping for the upper throne room for good exp, but the loot isn't better up there. At 30-35, there's the sewers (really tough gators), the temple, the pyramid and the Avatar of Fear.<br />
<br />
Trains happen, most often during off-peak hours when there are few players around. They are usually announced and you can most often get out without a problem. BUT it isn't anywhere near the nightmare of Unrest or the weird pathing problems of MM. Definitely my favorite dungeon to date.<br />
