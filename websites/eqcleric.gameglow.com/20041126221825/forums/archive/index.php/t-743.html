<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chikung</div><div class="date">08-04-2000, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just started a Erudite Nec so I could group with a friend that picked a Erudite Enchanter.<br />
Both of us are new to that area of Norrath (She is completely new to the game) and I am aware how desolate that part of the world can be...<br />
Since I start in Paineel and she in Erudin, will meeting up be a hassle in terms of factions etc. Or should I just make an Erudite Mage and start with her in Erudin as well.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking for a good soloable/Enchanter groupable character.<br />
Lots of info on Necros (I read that thread) but not a lot of talk on Mages. Anyone have any good advice out there?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">08-04-2000, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Uhm... you need to make an Erudite cleric! Yeah, that's it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
<br />
Mages are quite soloable. I get quite a bit of enjoyment from mine. And the best part is you'll be right next to the library where you can buy those hard-to-find spells (like Staff of Tracing, Summon Fang, etc).<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you stick to Tox. I find that it's still one of the most underused zones. Most of the people who hunt there are genuine newbies because they don't know about the rest of the world. Twinks generally get taken somewhere else to level.<br />
<br />
Tox will start to green out around 8 or so and by then you should both be accustomed enough to your classes to venture elsewhere. BB or WK by the QH zone are good places to do that.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

I dont think starting factions have changed much and before paineel, you actually DID start at the gates inside erudin. as long as you stay away from quest you should beable to pass throughe erudin fine. (most quest give heretic faction and you never get heretic faction without takeing erudin faction hits)<br />
<br />
how ever im pretty sure your friend will be totaly kos in paineel. <br />
<br />
also as a necro you get invisiability at level 8 (self only).</div></div><hr />
