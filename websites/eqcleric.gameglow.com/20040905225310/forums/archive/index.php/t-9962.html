People think 21 days is alot of time /played on a char is alot these days.  <br />

My first char was/is a 55 ranger with just under 80 days played, my second was/is my necro with roughly 20 days on him and as a cleric I am around 18 days played.<br />
<br />
These are just the characers I'm still playing with any regularity, I shudder to think how many days I have/had played between the toons I still have collecting dust (22 Wiz and 25 druid being the highest) and the myriad of toons I played to their late teens before deleting.<br />

<br />
First, 21 days is a lot of time, no matter what, unless you're considering the amount of time one sleeps during their life  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
The fact that you have played 200 days is irrelevant. Good for you.<br />
<br />
Lets put my comment back into context.. 21 days of playing has put me in the mid levels of Everquest. On the most basic level it frustrates me that after 21 days of playing my character (which has taken seven months) I have a rez spell no one wants. The second someone died in my group tonite, the rest of the group was out there looking for a 49 rezzer. My rez was basically ignored. It also annoys me when people are rude about it, as shown in my experience (see previous post).<br />
<br />
This attitude really irritates me. I am not a second rate cleric or a n00b cleric. When I freely offer the services that took me 21 days of playing this character to get, I do expect at least a thanks and a polite refusal. <br />

<br />
With that said though a level 43 is still relatively low in the game.  43 might not seem low out of 60, but in terms of time to play it is, simply because of the number of things to do that opens up after level 45.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeven</div><div class="date">01-31-2002, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">43 is low level, hehe. /sigh, i still remember when 50 was as high as you could get, and it seemed so far away.<br />
<br />
Now it's 60, and UGH, it IS so far away, lol.<br />
<br />
But to stay on topic, yes, you certainly do deserve to be spoken to with respect. But, unfortunately, people are spoiled now a days, and want the higher level rezzes. Most of the lower level characters playing now have a higher level character around somewhere, and are used to it.<br />
<br />
Try not to take offense if they would prefer a higher level rez(As long as they say so nicely) For they are normally just trying to save some of the hard work they have put into leveling. And soon, you will be getting way too many requests for that 49th level rez.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bindol</div><div class="date">02-01-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you hit on the exact problem.  People have gotten spoiled on the older servers where there are many clerics with the higher rezes.<br />
<br />
When I first started playing on Bertox, there were no clerics with a 50% rez, then finally some people hit 39 and when you occasionally got that 50% rez, you were ecstatic.<br />
<br />
When I started my cleric on Sol Ro to join some friends, there were already a number of level 60 clerics on the server, so by the time I got to 39 no one wanted the rez.<br />
<br />
Once I hit 49, the problem for the most part has gone away.  I still get the occasional person that wants a 56 rez, but for the most part it seems most people are happy with 90% exp returned.<br />

They'll allow looking for a res to stop their xp'ing for two hours when they could make that xp back easily if they stoped /shout'ing and get back to killing.</div></div><hr />
