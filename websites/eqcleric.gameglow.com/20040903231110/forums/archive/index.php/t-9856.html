<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistleburr</div><div class="date">06-22-2000, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I resigned as guildleader, officer, and member of the Mithril Heart Brigade on Tribunal server. I had been the second person invited into the guild, standing alongside the founder in Unrest when the lead server GM showed up to create it.<br />
<br />
Our guild had a very strict admission policy and was founded on a rigid ethic: Selfless aid to others regardless of personal risk.<br />
<br />
We developed a reputation on the server for helping those in need and upholding high standards of conduct.<br />
<br />
But our high level players did not group together, and we spent our time more apart from each other than together. I often saw those of my level only at guild-wide events.<br />
<br />
The demands of the guild were never balanced by benefits. I rarely saw my friends, almost never went into dungeons, passed on lots of invitations to groups/raids/planes etc. to be available for my guild.<br />
<br />
So there was no support for me as a player. We had a fine reputation but the guild left me isolated, lonely, and drained.<br />
<br />
Then a series of unending flamewars among several of the guild members started to tear down the reputation of the guild. They did not see that their actions reflected upon all of us. My calls for moderation went unheeded.<br />
<br />
The other officers of the guild would not censure the members for conducting personal attacks on other guild message boards. I saw our good name, the only redeeming feature of the guild that remained, being shredded.<br />
<br />
Ultimately the apathy, indifference, and vitriol suffocated me beneath their weight.<br />
<br />
I miss my friends, I miss our times together. I miss my fine guild.<br />
<br />
I weep.<br />

<br />
Firstly, you dont know me but I certainly know of you.  I am a Southern Legion cleric on the same server, and you are the cleric that I have always aspired to be.<br />
<br />
I hear of your exploits on an almost daily basis, of your kindness and self sacrifice.  Trust me, the server supports you and you will never be alone.<br />
<br />
It is very sad that the MHB has had some hard times, they were a very honourable guild and I too am sad to see you leave them.<br />
<br />
Things will get better though, we have had highs and lows as a guild, as I think every guild must do.  Whether or not you return to MHB or not, know that you are respected across the server, and you will never be lonely or without friends.<br />
