<br />
After wasting countless hours at the giants in FM, trying to get a loop, im very pleased i moved here (thanks for the suggestion Falladar). <br />
<br />
I suggest a group with at least one tank (prefer more), you the cleric, and whoever else you care to add.<br />
<br />
I was grouped at 38 with a 44 ranger, 40 warrior, and the xp flowed like water.<br />
Ranger was constantly pulling single blue (to ranger) rhino, Cockatrices, Cactii, Sarnaks.<br />
<br />
No downtime, buff/med/heal/stamina from me, sow/buffs from the ranger, and heavy melee action.<br />
<br />
In a larger group there are some juicy Sarnak ruins not too far into the zone, with some ok  (non-common) loot, and 6min spawns (frantic but fantastic !).<br />
<br />
Have also tried enchanter, warrior, warrior, cleric, cleric - which also worked well, with one cleric playing wannabe wizzy  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Our enchanter got 39, and started gravity fluxing rhinos - lol  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Got 38, 39, and am now 2 bub from 40, all in a 3 day weekend  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
A 34+ cleric should do well here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The recent patch has removed or greatly reduced the loot from the Sarnak Enthusiasts and Partisans.<br />
Non-stop pulled from the 3 ruins last night for nearly 2 hours, nothing dropped.<br />
<br />
The 45 Ranger assisting had managed 2 earings of station, and a tunic the day before patch.<br />
<br />
The claw(s) they dropped rarely was 7/33 - worse than a PGT really, how imbalancing is that ?</div></div><hr />
