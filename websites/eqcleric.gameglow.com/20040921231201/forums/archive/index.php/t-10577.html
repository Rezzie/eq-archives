I have gone thru with parties, so I know the area pretty well.  The only other thing is, getting aggrod by all the green trash in upper on the way there.  I suppose i could run like a banshee to the lguk zone, yeah, that would be kinda fun =)  <br />

<br />
The dead side zone into lower guk leads is a passage way which forks into two passages in a small room.<br />
<br />
The passage way and room contain live frog spawns (warrior and shaman types).<br />
<br />
The left passage from this room is live as well.<br />
<br />
The right side is undead. About 4 - 5 undead type spawns (warriors and wizards - wizards hit VERY hard but dont have many hp).<br />
<br />
At you level you could possibly take either live or dead one-on-one, but two+ will more than likly mean you have to zone. Unless other people are camping the same spot you or have already cleared it out, you will most likely get two or more most of the time.<br />
<br />
Personaly i'd leave lower guk till the next level range. At that level you will get more out of it. Also you will be spending a lot of time here (although not at the zone) for the rest of remaining life as you charicter. It can start to get a bit repetative after a while  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

I have not done it yet, nor do I really look forward to travelling there (druid ride or not).  But if it was a boon of xp for me, I prolly would go =).  Right now I am grinding away in HK, although I am one the highest people there, occasionaly someone else is, its good xp, and while you wouldnt think it, is somewhat of a good time.  On my server, there isnt a whole lot of high level people, (brell serilis)  there are FAR more sub 20 people right now.  I have already gone to LGuk a few times, and have actually gotten some nice things, Shin Greeves and a Guise.  I go with my guild, who are primarily 35+, and me being the only Cleric in the guild, I get defaulted to go to these places =)  <br />
<br />
Somewhere else i am thinking of trying, just out spite mainly, is Freeport Guards.  I am a dwarf cleric, but I have become KOS with them (yeah so i killed the lady at the end of the docks ONE to many times...) but I have been trying to get faction back with them for like 10 levels, and they are still KOS.  So I have come to the conclusion that, while hunting them I will become a DE.  I plan on starting with the 2 by the toll booth.  Both are blue to me, and I have yet to kill them both.  I only have gotten them both almost dead before i go oom.  I gotta start using Calm, and do 'em one at a time.  <br />

I dont waste any time so Im not sure if they would attack if I lingered too long.<br />
<br />
I can also make it to the live zone also but not without pulling a big train and losing a lot of health points.  Wouldn't recommend this to a cleric without SoW because they have lower health points to begin with.  Divine arua may be the equilizer here.<br />
<br />
The frogs dont seem to be able to see invisible or cammo so if you find a friendly wizard, druid, ranger, etc... then you can pretty much go whereever you want to go.<br />
<br />
You will be able to fight very close to the zone so its definately worth a shot.  The dead frogs nearest the zone will /con high blue to you so I dunno if you can solo here.  As a paladin without ghoulbane I definately have a hard time but then again I only have the lvl 14 cleric undead spell (I foget the name, it does 94 damage) and the lvl 5 stun spell so my offensive magics are more limited.</div></div><hr />

If I solo there its usually to pick of the small things when someone asks fer help stun swing and nuke heheheehe some days its good some days its bad... I usually group there anyhows. But I can solo while waiting for a group.<br />

<br />
I had a L28 Troll Warrior with me, we did fairly well together.  <br />
<br />
Also about the camo thing..  The frolok Shaman and wiz's will see invis you.  Same thing in Sol a.  You can walk by the knights all day long, but the shaman will see you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">11-22-1999, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think that Lower guk is a nightmare at level 32. I got to level 33 but thanks to a long string of deaths I am 32 again.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there is always a group camping the first room (where you go right for deadside and left for live side). And my problem is i got bored. I got into a good group, and we camped the bedroom and everything we could pull to there (except greater Icebones). The problem is that it is Train Central.<br />
<br />
Four Greater Icebones spawn a short ways in and tend to get trained. now these four will make short work of most groups not in their 40s my group was 40th paladin, 40th shadowknight, 35th cleric, 34th druid, 33rd Cleric and 31 paladin. Keep in mind we were all nicely equipped (ghoulbanes for the pallys, dark reaver for SK, etc). the entire group was dead within 1 minute or so (me being the first killed in 10 seconds).<br />
<br />
If you are going to hunt in lower guk in the low 30s then stay near the zone. If someone yells train, invis to undead and run. going deeper into lower guk seriouly lessens your chances of making it to the zone (don't get me started on the Re-Animated Hand incident or the Mino Patriarch. Also, be patient. If you get bored, stay there. Even with the good group i had it was a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Heh, back to druids and Centaurs for me.<br />
