<br />
First of all, get yourself to Oasis.  Stay along the sea shore.  When you see a dock, swim up the the pilliar in the water.  That is P1.  Now, you are a cleric, only you need to advertise yourself as a healer.  The more wit in your advertisement, the better your chances for a group.  Mention Heals, Buffs, Food and Water if you got it.<br />
<br />
The spot I found was great.  Go west and you'll see a gypsy camp near the oasis (lake).  Follow that till you see the cliffs keeping close to the water.  This is orc highway.  All orcs all the time.  If you get the right spot, you shouldn't have to worry about sand giants.  Only the occasional &quot;A Orc Warrior&quot; that you may have some problems with depending on your level.  Remember this needs to be a group thing, not solo.<br />
<br />
The group I was in went something like this.  Me (cleric), Wizard, warrior, paladin, druid, necro.  We put sow and all buffs on the tanks.  The warrior was the puller.  No one else pulls.  He come's back with one or two orcs.  We fight them and as soon as they start to run away, the warrior pulls another.  By the time we kill the orc, the warrior has shown up with another orc.  We were able to go a long time with constent fighting.  Once we got used to each other, we all kept commenting on &quot;the well oiled&quot; machine.  I'm a 16 cleric and most of these still con blue to me.  Just remember that you need to save your mana for healing.<br />
<br />
Tip:  Try not to heal until the tanks have the mob to about half health.  If you heal to early, they'll jump ya.  It's not what you want if there are more than one mob, you can't cast that life saving heal if you got something interupting your casting.<br />
<br />
One bad thing about this spot is that no zone is near.  You got a long way to run if a battle goes bad.  I recomend having a bard in the group.  Bards are invaluable.  Bards can help heal folks inbetween fights, and act like a group sow if a batle does go sour.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that was what I have been doing for the last couple of levels.  Orc highway can be insane xp if done right and you develop a good pulling rythem.</div></div><hr />
