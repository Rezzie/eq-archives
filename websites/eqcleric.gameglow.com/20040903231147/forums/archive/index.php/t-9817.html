<br />
For the last few weeks I have been playing a bard almost exclusively and have semi retired my level 36 cleric. <br />
<br />
My bard is level 14, was 15 but died from a nasty train that jumped us while we were fighting a giant skelly. As usual it was just before I was going to log (Funny how that happens).<br />
<br />
Anyway, Im having a blast playing the bard and love how the bard can do so many things. Kind of the opposite of my cleric which seems very focused and specialized in his purpose.<br />
<br />
Also, there is alot less stress playing my bard than when I played my cleric. Everyone looks to the cleric to keep them alive and I always felt terrible and like a failure if anyone died in my group.<br />
<br />
With my bard, Im pretty high on the agro list especially when there is multiple mobs so if anyone dies I will probably already be dead.<br />
<br />
One thing Ive noticed while playing my bard is that clerics do command alot of respect when in a group. People usually listen to what they have to say and many times they act as group leader.<br />
<br />
I still have a soft spot for clerics and I love to watch how they play their characters. On the whole clerics take healing far more seriously than druids or shamans. <br />
<br />
When Im in a group without a cleric I pretty much dont expect heals from the experiences Ive had so far. But with a cleric Im pretty confident that I will get healed.<br />
<br />
For the record I realize that many druids and shamans play their class well and do heal but Im a casual player and I dont have the luxury of grouping with knowledgeable people all the time.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, for anyone who is maybe feeling a little burnout from the narrow focus of the cleric and not to mention the pressure that comes with the job, I recommend that you explore other classes. <br />
<br />
When in groups I noticed how effective a bard can be and chose that class. I also hope to one day play an enchanter. EQ is now fun again and has the feeling of adventure again. Playing my cleric had begun to feel like a job (buff, med, stun, med, heal, so on).<br />
<br />
To all the clerics out there I salute you and Im always thrilled when one of you are im my group : ).<br />
<br />
P.S. My level 36 cleric is on bristlebane server (the high level overcrowding did contribute to my burnout). My level 14 bard is on Luclin and is very untwinked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azael</div><div class="date">04-04-2000, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for posting this, Klang. I myself feel that way a lot when I'm playing my cleric. There's a lot of pressure and it can get very stressful, especially when you're leading the group and also trying to keep it filled and balanced. I've been thinking about starting a bard for a long time, since they always seemed like a lot of fun (and I love grouping with people). Maybe I'll do that soon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks, and enjoy your new crowd-free bardic life.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

My cleric is still primary, but an enchanter is similar in that they are a lot more subtle, but fun. I also have a ranger and hit hit hit hit kick hit hit hit hit gets old fast. I recommend an enchanter!!!<br />

<br />
Always wanted to bash with a tail.. LOL<br />
<br />
A big difference from the constant healing, constant strategy, keeping an eye out on things type of playing... At times, I miss being in the thick of things, but I never miss getting hit.. LOL<br />
<br />
Hope you enjoy playing your bard, and have fun. That's what this game is all about.</div></div><hr />
