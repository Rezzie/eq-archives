Sure we don't get to melee or mix it up too much with the combat. Yes, we are very dependent on mana. But I for one have never, ever been bored playing a cleric.<br />
<br />
I find it amazing that even other high level clerics say that our role consists of sitting on our butts all the time and medding, only standing up to heal or buff. My gawd, if I played my cleric that way I'd be out of a job. My role is not only to heal but to prevent damage to the group. So I'll chainstun that caster or healer mob, root extras, try to cripple a gating mob when he is low on life, throw a root or stun on the thing the wizard just aggroed, atone the mob the bard charmed or the enchanter mezzed, nuke or stun the runner that just got away. All that is juggled while anticipating when heals will be needed, throwing invigor on the warrior after he's been fighting for a while, sneaking in buffs when mana is plentiful to prevent downtime later, reacting instantly to vulnerable party members losing health, judging the timing of CH, deciding in a split second who to heal first and who can wait when it gets bad, not to mention that I'm usually the one nominated to call evac. My goal is always to be efficient enough with mana that I cause the group little to no downtime, and with clarity available and in a good group it is a goal I usually achieve. We're barely done with one battle and the puller is running off to start the next one. So who has time to get bored?<br />
<br />
Clericing for me is nonstop action and requires intense mental energy and constant attention. It is stressful but exhilarating. I boggled at the person I met recently who said they liked playing their cleric better than their warrior because they could watch TV and play at the same time. When I'm healing my attention never leaves my screen for a moment. Even a second or two is enough time to be too late to heal someone who got smacked. Last night I missed dinner because I couldn't be afk long enough to get food. I was the only healer in the group, and we were not in a safe area. Sure I am intense, and I take my job too seriously, but I have a reputation that people rarely die in my groups.<br />
<br />
I am &quot;only&quot; level 50, but the people I party with most often are in the mid fifties. I don't think either my role or my satisfaction with my class will change; I am actually looking forward to getting the new spells and experimenting with new ways to make them useful to a group.<br />
<br />
Boring? You can be an adequate cleric by medding a lot and tossing off heals. But it doesn't have to be this way, and I would argue that it is not the most effective way to play the class, either.<br />

<br />
Sometimes a cleric get thrusted into a med heal med heal buff med heal buff - because the group is taking on more than they really can handle and cleric is constantly trying to catch up mana wise.<br />
<br />
I have been on plain runs where they really didn't need a cleric - the only reason I was there so I could res people &lt;*shrug*&gt;<br />
<br />
As for watching TV well if I am camping the south west corner of dungeon watching fungus grow - hell I cook dinner - now if were cutting that dungeon moving from one spot to another - that can be exciting.<br />

The cleric of course.<br />
Chain stun piss it off, do a few /rudes, swing that hammer and keep chain stuning.  WHY do you think clerics wear plate?  Cause it looks good? :-)<br />
Frogy croaks.... cleric moves to the next frog.<br />

You have described how a cleric is played at it's highest level of mastery.  Only the enchanter can turn the tide of a battle more noticeably than a cleric.  Not to mention that the cleric is a great pulling class.<br />
<br />
I was a bit amazed when looking at the normal spell set-up for a number of clerics, when I noticed they keep neither root or the level 5 stun spell mem'd.  I personally would go without a direct damage spell before I would unmem either of those spells.  They are vital tools of our trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seliris</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm fairly burned out, moreso on the constant whines and tells I get about rezzes than the actual char itself....<br />
<br />
So I play a heavily twinked necro on another server (i know all of 4 people on there) and enjoy the silence, and the occasional conversation with my coworkers.<br />
<br />
So, bored with the class? no...<br />
Bored with the people? yes.</div></div><hr />

With the right group in the right spot just farming xp, it can get boring.  The tank I'm with will sometimes come out of a fight and not even need a heal.  So I throw 1 nuke, med, buff when it's time and maybe stun if something is trying to gate or if it's trying to cast dispell.  With an enchanter to do crowd control and once spawns in an area are broken up, it can become boring.  Is this every night?  No.  Take the same group and instead of sitting by the zone in chardok pulling, wander down deep inside (didn't do the royals or Kocorust).  We just wandered from place to place and that was much more interesting.  Always having pulls of 3+, helping stun mobs as the enchanter is trying to mezz.  Tanking for a bit after throwing a heal on the puller till the enchanter gets stuff mezzed.  Anyway, it can be boring but it certainly doesn't have to be.  It just depends on who you are with and what you are doing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;Rayne&quot; character has to be approaching 100 days played (may have crossed).  I don't know if there's anything wrong with the class, but for me playing ANY character that much can get old.  Rayne the Cleric hasn't &quot;done it all, &quot; or &quot;seen it all&quot; yet, but he's pretty damned close.  More importantly, I don't feel like I'm growing that much as a player of Clerics.  Sure, I'll pick up a new tip every once in a while, but having taken my party through countless life or death struggles, well, even those get kind of old after a while.  I can imagine my Enchanter buddy saying the same thing, &quot;Another 5 pull, *yawn*.&quot;  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Lately I've been working my SK as much as possible.  My now reduced circle of close friends (down to 3 from the original 6) often finds ourselves short a tank, and sometimes the Enchanter.  So I'm hoping the SK can pick up the slack for us on those off nights.  Also, the SK is about as different from a Cleric as I could get (and still cast spells, how can non-caster classes STAND it?).  The SK &quot;can&quot; pull in a pinch and I really like pulling anyway, so I'm still having a lot of fun with him.  <br />
<br />
Heh, in UO I had four different characters that I played a LOT, all with very different skill sets.  I'm still amazed that I've played Rayne as much as I have.<br />
