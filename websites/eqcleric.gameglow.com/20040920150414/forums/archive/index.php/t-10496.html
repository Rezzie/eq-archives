These guys are easy to solo too!  Root, smite, smite, smite, melee, med, ad nauseaum.  All were blue with the occasional white/black at lev 19.  Every kill I received noticable exp.  I went through 19 almost entirely on these guys.  It is best to wait until the later hours because NK does get rather crowded.  hope this helps.<br />
