<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Julianana</div><div class="date">01-28-2000, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there.<br />
<br />
For 41(and 0 bubs) - 43(and 4 bubs) I´ve been killing Ogre Guards inside Oggok. This has given me 3/4 to 1 bub and hour and an average of 130 pp per hour.<br />
<br />
The advantage of hunting in there is:<br />
<br />
1st: There is a merchant that will give you good prices when in wolfform, or in DE form.<br />
<br />
2nd: You fight back to zone. no risck of dying.<br />
<br />
3rd: constant pulling with the right group. 1 tank of 43+ (warrior for CHeal, or monk for fast damage preffered), 1 Druid who is there to master loot, wolfform and pack regen/chloro), and a cleric... for optimization throw in a nice bard or another tank (bard is best since you will be fm at all time, and can almost keep the 1st half of the zone clean).<br />
<br />
4th: Only take fractionhit against ogre guards.<br />
<br />
5th: So few ppl know about this place. You will find a maximum of 7 ppl in zone at peak : )<br />
<br />
6th: The ogre guards are 12+ pp a kill : )<br />
<br />
For those of you who have allready tried to kill the guards outside Oggok (the ones in ferrott), dont mark me as insane. The guards inside are way easier.<br />
<br />
If this is a lvl 39 group you better go 6 ppl. 1 cleric is enough if you got manasong or clarity. Just fill up with tanks.<br />

I have gone from 36 to 40 here so fare. And even thou my stuns dont work. I still like it here. It can get bad at times. But for the most part it is a select few # of friends that play.</div></div><hr />

I am wondering when you say that stuns don't work, is it because ogres have the &quot;unstunnable-giant&quot; code or just because of their extremely high magic resistance?<br />

<br />
This is a weird one. You can stun them and it is not resisted, they take the damage, but they keep on swinging. This is the same way clops and giants behave.<br />
<br />
However, get someone to lower their magic resist and a stun will cause them to stop fighting.<br />
<br />
I've never tried stunning a clops or a giant with lowered magic resist. I wonder if they would stop, too.<br />

I use my level 5 stun almost exclusively.  Now, sometimes, the Ogres appear to swing.  I am not sure if this because they were already in the process of swinging when the stun hit, that they get riposte even when stunned, or if it is just lag.....<br />
