<br />
In particular, I'm wondering what the Cleric role is.  If someone gets the poison DoT, should I just blow mana healing or try to use abolish poison (lvl 49 spell) to get rid of the DoT?<br />
<br />
Can 30 people averaging level 55 take it down with mediocre resist gear?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

At level 54 you are probably not going to resist anything, so I recommend that you buff then move the clerics that are under level 58 to out of the range of the fear and AE. Those clerics can stand in the path of the feared people and heal them as they run back to the fight.<br />
The first few times we killed him, most of the clerics were unable to heal anyone. Then again, hardly anyone was resisting the fear, so agro was constantly being swaped between players, heh.<br />
The 0 damage AE just makes him soooooo easy, just remember to dispell him several times, he has full shamen buffs..<br />

I think my resists were 140MR/125PR fully buffed (Ok, so I was REALLY unprepared) and I spent the ENTIRE battle running. Not to mention when most of the gang is feared you dash hither and yon through the zone, aggro'ing lots of nifty creatures. It looked like we were having a parade after a while. 8)<br />
<br />
We had approx 50 people levels 50-60. EVERYONE was getting feared, don't bother with dispelling the poison, the hard part is that you can't heal a darn person because you're too busy trotting back and forth across the countryside. The only way we beat him was battle rezzes and lots of persevereance.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Just about the funniest battle I've ever been in though. 8)</div></div><hr />

Once thats done its hard not to win because he just does not do any real damage - though the fight can be rather long due to the stun/fear combo. We just put everyone smack under his belly and fight it out - use remedy/ce/celheal for the fast cast and cast asap if you resist a stun. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">05-22-2001, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Severilous is pretty easy.  With DMF (+70 PR) and Talisman of Shadoo (+45 PR), you can get 200 PR with just 85 Base PR.  Like others have said its a stun that does no dmg, just prevents attacking, casting, moving, etc.  Levels matter most on resisting, a lvl 60 will resist more fears and stuns with a 100 PR/DR than a lvl 50 will with 200/200.  Bark potions are not needed for Severilious.  Just keep your lower level clerics back out of fear range and lets the tanks run back to them.  Your higher level healers with good resist can stay pretty close to the action.  If you are going to be healing in the middle of the fight, stick with remedy and divine light.  Only time you will get a CH off is when you when you resist the stun, but even at 60 with 240 PR I get stunned close to half the time.  Your tanks shouldnt take that much dmg, it actually more annoying fight than anything since the stuns just prolong the fight.  EM Legs, BD jewelry, Prismatic Shield, Teacher syllabus are all good items to have for a Severilous run.<br />
<br />
Woushi is essentially the same fight but with a druid dragon.  He is a bit higher level, harder to resist, will gate.  The one thing that make him easy is Woushi is slowable.<br />

Does the melee 'fearless' disc work vs. dragon's roar? I cannot seem to get my rogue high enough level to go do this sort of fun stuff, because everyone seems to be needing clerics more...</div></div><hr />
