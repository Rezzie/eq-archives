<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayrlorn</div><div class="date">10-30-1999, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People wonder why I solo....<br />
<br />
I'm in a group with four other really good people hunting hill giants in Rathe Mountains.  I am the only cleric in the group and I am the highest level person there (necessary person for them to fight hill giants with).  We are killing hill giants left and right, but there are three problems developing that I notice.<br />
<br />
1) One Paladin friend of mine is the sole focus of all the Hill Giant attacks, and I do mean 99% of them.  I mentioned *repeatedly* that it is much more mana efficient/safer if he would back off occasionally and try not to be the only target (spreading the damage around the other two tanks makes my job much easier).  It got to the point were I just asked him to back out of combat and the hill giant would follow him... it turns out that he was laying on the taunt button non-stop! argh...<br />
<br />
2) I would be asked for a mana report every ten seconds.. I'm not joking.  If I say 40% three lines up and twelve seconds ago not much has changed.. (I understand the importance of this, but what has ever happened to common?).<br />
<br />
3) Twice I was left out of the random loot rolls.  This happens to me more often than I can count actually, because I don't take a direct hand in fighting but play support I find I get passed over a lot.  Both times I pointed this out, but once it was too late and someone else got the loot.  I feel bad in a way speaking out, but this is one of my pet peeves...<br />
<br />
Am I the only cleric to have experienced this?  The group of people I teamed up with are not jerks or anything like that at all, they are very good and honest adventurers.  It's just in my experience a good cleric only stands out when the group previously teams up with a bad cleric  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirienne</div><div class="date">10-31-1999, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have noticed that as a cleric, I get left out of the loot cycle in a lot of different groups.  I can only assume that the person that is in melee with the critter hit the left mouse button one too many times on accident.  But it happens so often with so many different people, that I have taken to the attitude that if they leave it lying for a minute and all go sit down, I loot the damn thing.  I don't ask, I don't tell them, I just loot it.  I guess you could say that it isn't in character for a cleric, especially a high elf, but I got so sick of not getting to loot and being poor, that I said screw it.  I too have taken to soloing or having a higher level member of my guild help me kill stuff.  Oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">11-01-1999, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My solution to this: a good guild. <br />
<br />
We loot randomly, Treasurer for guild gets almost all of it. He buys/trades for us on big items, hands out cash/goodies for us when we need.  Spell level coming up, He has either all our spells in a bag or all spell components that we will need and gives them to us. It works great if you are in a god guild.  And I avoid grouping with non guild members also.<br />

<br />
We killed the steel golem last night, he hits hard to us 30 level players.  I'm standing in the back waiting to heal my group when one is down to 2 bubbles and screams HEAL.  Now if this was a group that hadn't been giving me loot, well I think my answer would have been... You going to include me in loot this time?<br />
<br />
The groups that I've been in lately really don't care about the general loot... so I usually loot with loot split on.  They don't care.  So far, I've never been denied the special items, and usually take myself if I already have the item and someone else in the group doesn't.  Guess I'm weird though.. I don't charge looting fees for special quest items and don't sell the specific rogue armor to the higest bidder.<br />
<br />
Oh well  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I place myself in charge of the loot.  It can be a bit annoying with all the other things I have to do to keep my group alive, but everyone else seems to appreciate it..<br />

<br />
I always offer to master loot if the group is doing that. That way I can take some off the top of the split for symbol reagents  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Leader:  &quot;Hey, Ele, could you keep track of the loot?&quot;<br />
Me:  &quot;Uh, sure I guess.&quot;<br />
But then, we have a 3pp alpha system.  Person loots up to 3pp in money or items, then its the next person's turn.  I think they ask me cause I always seem to remember who's turn it is when.<br />

I myself have several characters.  Believe me, when I play a warrior, if the cleric doesn't have much mana, I am more than happy to wait a while.  That's why I keep a fletching kit with me.  As far as looting goes, i am farily relaxed about it.  As long as I get a reasonable reward for my efforts, i don't care about the loot.  Frankly, when someone is pulling, I feel they are taking more risk and should get a greater reward.  I am curious to know what others think of this, since i am only 19th level and have not hit the major dumgeons yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkith</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tend to get this too...or I used to get this...<br />
<br />
I now take matters into my own hands.. <br />
<br />
I don't go ahead and loot whatever is left for more than a few seconds, I call loot order.<br />
<br />
I started to run my own groups of regular people here there and everywhere...I have 3 main tanks (war, Pal and Monk), a Druid and a wizard (plus me the cleric).  All in all pretty balanced.  <br />
<br />
I got tired of being left out of loot and what not.  I also know VERY WELL that my party appreciates me.. <br />
<br />
I am very fair with loot, and try to get the concept of 'He who needs the special item most should get it'....Those that loot out of cycle of rip the group off, are left hanging in the cold.  I soon remove them from the group and get a replacement, and my groups are good...we go entire evenings getting lots of loot and experience with no deaths....we click well and trust one another.<br />
<br />
A couple of bad ones come to mind:<br />
<br />
We were grouped with a Paladin in Unrest named Dammed.  Well we were on a 2pp alpha loot, and it turned out that Dammed ONLY looted bronze items.  He was taking pieces of ringmail that he found and destroying them, and not counting them in his loot tally. Now if I'm waiting for a BS tunic and I loot a BS mantel...I'm NOT going to destroy the mantel simply because I am still waiting for a tunic.  I left that group and the remaining group kicked Dammed out and asked me to rejoin.  Needless to say.. I now get tells from Dammed asking to be invited to my group...he's still soloing or trying other groups as far as I know...<br />
<br />
The other incident was a druid...Eleron.  Seems like a nice fellow, but I think that hemay have his bad moments.  He was our druid in the group and we had a rather large pull....it included the Barkeep...Well we fight..and kill the barroom when someone else trains the Ghoul Magi at us...The barkepp was wielding a Rapier BTW.  Eleron loots the Barkeep, and we kill the Magi...I was next in loot, and I ASSUMED he had gotten 2pp from the Barkeep (the rapier alone)...<br />
<br />
Well I looted the magi, and was going to give the Savants Cap to another party member..who didn't have one (I had one), when Eleron said that it was his loot.  We all questioned this as he had looted the barkeep.  He stated that NOTHING (not even money) was on the barkeep, no apron, no ear ring, and the Weapon was Rusty.  I checked the corpse of the barkeep and noticed that it had nothing but the key.  So Eleron took the time, during a fight to loot and Destroy a rusty rapier, but not the key...<br />
<br />
I gave him the cap.  Then spent 10 seconds in tells with other members of the group...then on consensus...kicked him out.<br />
<br />
We then grouped another druid that was excellent.  <br />
<br />
I've now sold a half dozen caps, and he has asked to be in my group again.  I've told him no and the reasons why...until someone in the zone shouts out 'WTF?  Nothing on the barkeep but a key and a rusty weapon?  Whats up with that?'....He isn't in my group..<br />
<br />
Long rant, but the point is to take control...Yer never left out if you take control.  Also make it a point to be CRUPULOUSLY HONEST.  I have a monk in the party that had me hold 600pp until he needed to buy something....he did so because he trusted me to do so.  (Monks are weight sensitive).  That way when you say to someone LOOT...no one questions it...nor do they feel like they are receiving the short end of the stick...<br />
