<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">05-13-2001, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've a 35th level shadowknight I've been grouping with and we went out to Velerious and on the beach near the gnome encampment are snow cougars. These provided me with great exp and no loot. It's a bit boring though, just an exp grind.<br />
<br />
We got bored with it after two days and went to the Rathe Mountains where we started off with cyclops. They were blue to him and were better than the cats exp wise, and the loot was better. Wanting to try different things, we started off on the Hill Giants which conned even or yellow to him. We didn't get to try them with just us two, we grouped with a 35th wizard and cleric. Cleric mana was always near full and I don't doubt we could have taken them on our own, but better safe than dead.<br />
<br />
I suppose this should go under the 35th level category, but since Neiff is 27th and hunting here, here it is. <br />
<br />
Of all the places we've fought and that I've commented on in this category, SolA seems to be the best exp wise for me. I was coming back with about the same money as in Hill Giants, and there was always enough goblins around to kill.</div></div><hr />

I've done 1700pp (including weapons sales) with my 54 mage in under 2 hours.  (i still had time on my KEI when i was done!)</div></div><hr />
