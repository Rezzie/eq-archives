Well, seeing as how I got killed by them many times in my youth(lived in Lavastorm for about 5 levels) I took him out.  he was green to me at 26, but still gave me exp.  I stayed in zone, and took out some other greens and blues, until I was overloaded with bronze long swords(they ALL have one) I took off to EC, sold em for 3 plat each, went back, and killed some more.  Its a good steady stream, and unless theres a Sarge or a Dragoon, you should be okay.</div></div><hr />
