<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padane Fain</div><div class="date">11-14-2000, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok everyone I know that every one of you has probably experienced some anger, frustration, stress, and/or homicidal thoughts from the actions of D.U.M.B clerics.  But I just have a few things to say.  <br />
I've only been playing EverQuest for 3 months now, but I have learned many things over these months. (1st month played as a Ranger, 2nd and 3rd as a cleric) <br />
One important fact is a good cleric, won't start out as one. Some may start as decent or OK, but everyone learns from mistakes.  Boy I know I have. Another fact, no matter how twinked you are, you will die accept that, and as a cleric do everything in your power, including risking your own life to save a group member.  If every cleric did this, people would erect statues in our names, and sweep the ground we walk on to make sure I nice bronze armor (not until lvl 20 for us non twinkers) doesn't get a smudge.<br />
Never ever scream at team mates for not helping you when you yelled for help.  It happens, they have a bunch of creatures on them too so just fight and fight more. (Yes I have gotten angry before and been an idiot, I blamed teammates for death and threatened to leave, but when I look back, everyone died because of bad luck, another person not in group trained on us when we were already outnumbered)  <br />
<br />
When someone asks for buffs, wait until after the battle (lvl 5 was when I learned that one)if I had waited poor ol' &quot;lets call him joe&quot; would have lived...longer.<br />
<br />
The hot HELP OH PLEASE GOD MAKE THE BAD MOB STOP key is good unless you use it everytime an orc pawn gets on you. (lvl 13) <br />
<br />
When someone asks for buffs, be generous but if your in a group make sure no one is fighting and there is no one dying from disease or poison.  This is one point I didn't need to learn, but already knew.<br />
<br />
When you're in a group that watches as you take on a yellow con mob and laughs and says oops I didn't know when you die, THERE IS NO SECOND CHANCE!!! Leave that group and move on.<br />
<br />
Just a few more rants, I promise.<br />
<br />
We are not tanks wait...one more time for effect...WE ARE NOT TANKS!!! You do a WHOLE lot more good medding for a heal then going melee when you run out of mana.  Sure there are some situations where this is different but...over all when in doubt...med.  <br />
<br />
People saying they don't need a heal...will be needing one a WHOLE lot faster in battle than if you had healed them before hand.<br />
<br />
Just because were clerics doesn't mean we are Undead stoppers.  Raise your hand if you've ever heard of SPELL INTERRUPT /emote Raises his bloodied and beaten hand.  Boy did verant ever trick me on that one.  Can we say 2 deaths behind the locked door in befallen.  1 from thinking I'm a cleric I can kill undead, a second from corpse run boy that key is hard to use when you REALLY need it.  <br />
<br />
We are indeed a powerful class but don't abuse that power, please, I know I've encountered hostile people before who had a bad cleric experience.  <br />
<br />
Just one last string of quotes I usually throw out. <br />
&quot;I'm a good cleric, not a great one, don't test me&quot; Translation: &quot;Don't pull the entire Unrest zone on me just because you have a cleric in your group&quot;<br />
&quot;Fight to the death or don't fight at all&quot;  Translation: &quot;You give that MOB a kiss as I heal you up from 2 bubs, but if you start running because you think I'm going to let you die, you're doing the wrong thing, Cause A I can't heal you from a distance while you run, and B that MOB isn't going to die by itself. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OOM&quot;  Translation: This means OUT OF MANA for all of you that didn't already know, when I say this, you're on your own for awhile with those 5 yellow con MOBs so why not have some patience, you'll live longer.<br />
<br />
&quot;RUN&quot; Translation: When a Cleric says run, unless its a stupid cleric, YOU better DArn well be hauling your arse because the clerics in general know when a battle is going sour, and trust me, you run, don't worry about the clerics, We know what were doing. /emote puts on a blind fold, lights a cigarette and casts Divine aura while the MOBs pound him P.S.Hopes the group makes it to zone before he dies<br />
<br />
OK all I realize some of you may not agree with what I've said, but remember, 3 months playing EQ, and only 2 as a cleric. Also those lessons are mostly ones I've learned first hand.</div></div><hr />

If only I could tell people that when I say run, evac, go bye bye, aloha, hasta la pasta, that it really does mean PLEASE GO NOW I HAVE 18 SECONDS BEFORE I DIE A REALLY UNPLEASANT DEATH.  Funny, they don't quite understand, still, after 52.5 levels, that I keep 38 seconds of invuln loaded at all times, and use each when I think it would benefit the most.<br />
<br />
Your point about the running thing is well put.  I learned to tell people that if they weren't going to tank, I'd let the enchanter do it because at least they can't run far.  That puts things in perspective for a lot of tanks (cough you big boy you keel tings you take beating me lubbor you cough)<br />
<br />
Trust me, just let them know what you're going to do when you enter a group, and don't worry.  Once you get the hang of complete healing, you'll be making Rangers and Rogues pee when you announce &quot;Complete healing a_ranger_00&quot;<br />
<br />
But then again, I wouldn't be the most vile cleric of Tunare if I didn't scare people  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SeaOfHoles</div><div class="date">11-19-2000, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some buffs are very acceptable to throw in battle.  I often toss Heroic Bond in battle to refresh it and provide a group heal.  I have tossed Resist Magic or Symbols in battle.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, are those in battle buffs going to put you in a better situation at the end of the battle.  With CH being so powerful, I think symbol is a nice one to refresh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krela</div><div class="date">01-04-2001, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a relatively simple answer to the buffs in battle question...<br />
<br />
Any hp buff is effectively a heal so is okay to throw toss around in battle. Any AC buff is expensive both time and mana wise so is probably left to between fights so you can ask your puller to hold pulls or pull singles during med time.<br />
<br />
Heroic bond as mentioned earlier is a great relatively cheap group heal<br />
<br />
Symbol... if worn off on the primary tanks I would cast *before* complete healing. With marzin the extra 700 hp you heal with CH more than makes up for the time/mana cost.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soulweaver</div><div class="date">01-10-2001, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to back that last comment up, it becomes more evident as you get higher that with rezzes more prevalent the death of a cleric is a huge increase in downtime. Letting the cleric escape will reduce that downtime significantly.<br />
<br />
Common practice in the planes is when a pull goes bad, the clerics are ordered to camp. The tanks job is often to hold the mobs off until they have camped. <br />

I have to say that i WHOLE HEARTEDLY aggree with all of you and here is my only Rant.  I think that the thing that all clerics can do to build the rep. for our class are the two things that clerics do the best is there any reason why you cannot pause for 3 seconds to target some other player along the path from FP to Qeynos and buff him just to buff him?? I really dont think so, and since it raises our skills anyway WHY THE HELL NOT.  Or you see a player out soloing a young kodiak in WC and he is getting his tail whipped HEAL HIM again why not?? Im not talking about a speed run because you are late to join a group but if you are just out running errands what is stopping you and you would be shocked how many people remember your name and who knows that person may have an Alt who remembers that you did that.  I am not saying to go out of your way but come on use the gifts that our gods gave us and you will become not only respected but also admired.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/confused.gif<br />
