</FONT><HR>I noticed on the "Current Spell Load" post that most of the players ( I saw that I was the only one) that have Complete Heal don't keep it memorized.  I use it most of the time now.  It's a manasaver, especially on my tanks who have 2000+ hp.  I use it only in controlled circumstances and when the tank reaches 2 bubbles I begin casting.  Usually by the time it goes off, the tank is at 1 - 1 1/2 bubbles.  What would usually take two Superior Heals (500mp) is accomplished in one Complete Heal (400mp).<P>I know the cast time is long and there are a lot of situations where it's not useful, thus I keep Superior Heal and often Greater Heal memorized as well.  Greater Heal is my quick heal when a caster is going down fast or when I don't have much mana.  Superior Heal is still my mainline heal on everyone other than the main or sometimes secondary tank(s).<P>Anyone care to comment on why you may or may not use it?<P><P>------------------<BR>Lucretia Rialsq<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Bristlebane <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Complete heal is risky.<P>For example you could get jumped by something while you are casting the spell. If you get interrupted here it could mean one dead tank. I mean things can "spawn back" or some kobold could get moved passed where you are standing and feel like hitting you... I only use Complete heal when I know the area very well. <P>1 Complete heal could be mana effecient, but 2 Superior heals are much safer.. most of the time. But in a good team where all know what they're doing complete heal could be a good thing...<P>------------------<BR>Lito<BR>Prexus<BR>45 Cleric<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I agree.  Complete heal is risky.  I will ocassionally have it up (if I'm in a group with a warrior specifically and I'm going to reso and naltron him).  It's risky because of it's long cast time.  If not for the tank you are healing, but also in multi-mob pulls, for  others in the group that might also be taking  damage (ie you are casting complete on your tank when suddenly a caster starts getting mobbed).  Under certain circumstances I'll use it, but it's pretty rare.  <P>Dalain Brightgleam<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>bah! I will use Complete heal all the time in addition to having Superior and Greater memorized.  It has been my own experiecne that the people that I group with will trust me to keep them alive.  My tanks will continue to fight even below 1/2 bubble of health.  They trust in my ability come through.  So I honestly believe that Complete heal will be an asset to my spell list!<P>I guess my honesty with the groups that I have hunted with and my knowledge of pulse healing is a definite bonus.  <P>I can sign on and I will get 8 to 9 /tells asking me if I am grouped.   <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif">  Good healers are a commodity and people will seek you out all the time.  So my suggestion is practice, practice, practice... and add Complete healing to your list.  I know I will...<P>------------------<BR>Saeros Thex<BR>Level 32 Cleric<BR>Cazic Thule Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I guess we all have different strategies and ideas of what  the "best" healing method is...so, here is mine.<P>I got into a heated debate with another cleric one night because I was using greater heals and superior heal, rather than complete heal (like she thought I should). Actually, she made me feel so stupid, I almost left to hunt with another group.<P> There were 2 of us clerics and one tank.  He was doing his job *smacking* the mobs around while pre-fight buffed him and then  kept him healed.  I would throw in a few roots and/or stuns to help the battle a bit, but basically, I kept back at a distance and kept him healed.<P>Once in a while I threw in a wrath or smite to speed the battle along or help finish the mob off if our tank was tiring or I knew it was time for another mob to spawn in our room. <P>Well, this other cleric told me I was doing it ALL WRONG!<P>I was supposed to jump right in with my mace and help him pound away.  Then, when he got to 1 bub of health, cast complete heal on him.  "More mana efficient" she explained to me in lecture detail.<P>My defense of my battle strategy was this: <P> If my tank gets to 1 bub health, he is gonna be slower, tired and his fighting skills drop. (tell me if this is wrong). <P> Also, he is going to be in big trouble if another mob spawns in our room (or a train wanders by)and whacks him before I get complete heal off.  <P>Also, if another mob suddenly jumps me, the chances of me getting a complete heal off on him (or any heal at this point) is very iffy.<P>Anyway, to keep her happy, I changed my battle strategy and pretended to be a tank for the night (even though it really went against the grain)<P>NOW-- if I am in a large group, no way would I use this strategy of hers.  No matter how mana efficient it seems to be!<P>If I have 6 people down in Lower Guk and I do a little rooting/atone/stunning, I am going to find mana dropping.  <P>I am going to see everyone in the group's health dropping.  I throw in some greater heals or superior heals (depending how mana is and how many people need healing)  I try to keep everyone in the group at least to half health at all times.  I want them unstunned and able to blast/kill/run at will.<P>I try not to be a tank.  The first time I throw out a complete heal, the mob is on me.  All of them.  So, now you have me in a big battle myself with a mob(s), (remember, she said to use that mace) I can't get a heal off on anyone and half the group was down to 1 bubble.  People are gonna die :-(.<P>So, after this long tirade (hmm, maybe I am on wrong board).... am I doing wrong?<P>If you are my tank (or in my group), do you want me to let your health drop low and then complete heal or keep you kicking  with greater heals/superior heals throughout?<P>What do the rest of you do?<P>------------------<BR>Sheri D'Kinlarr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I use complete heal for:<P>Transfering mana around efficiently, (enchanter oom from giving everyone clarity an othe rbuffs.. manastone doen to near death and complete heal him)<P>Getting quick mana in safe areas, fully buffed using manastone then complete heal on yourself, I net almost a full bubble each time.. Can do 1 ressurection every minute doing this, without sitting down to med at all hehe.<P>healing a fatass ogre warrior thats buffed up .. during combat.(or some other high HP tank)<P>Healing a tank who is very low on hp during downtime, and no druid/shaman to regen <P>Healing other stuff.  necro pets for example (close to 3000 hps at least buffed, in a small party where you rely on a level 50 necro pet, complete healing them works VERY well. Or perhaps a charmed firegiant vs nagafen? =)   )<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I use it in controlled situations- ie when a room spawn is known and the spawn is spaced out enough that I won't get agro'd the second it goes off.  Or on tanks that have tons of hitpoints.  I'll make sure everyone taking damage is above 4 bubs before I start casting and then tell the party what I'm doing, so they know not to over-burn or other wise taunt the MOB onto them.<P>It's the most mana efficient thing out there for those tanks with ungodly hitpoints.  I grouped with a level 49 cleric, a level 50 troll warrior, a level 49 ogre warrior, and an 40 enchanter (I was 45 at the time).  We pulled non-stop for 4 hours killing bugs of all sorts with little or no down time. They would pull even if they were half health, knowing that a complete heal was coming as soon as they got to 2 bubs.  Made mad experience doing this.<P>Even better trick for regen of a party with manastones is the necro spell- pack of shadows (level 49? research spell).  Have eveyone stone down to 2 bubs and have the necro cast that spell on all the casters (clerics included) sit down and med.  When the necro gets down to 2 bubs- superior heal him.  Works even better than cloro/pack regen to get mana back.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The only time I use Complete is in special situations fighting mobs that do ungodly amounts of damage like the Ghoul Lord, death beetles, or lava beetles. I suppose it would be useful if the group had only one tank, even then risky despite the mana saved. Not much saved if you have to cast a 500 mana res afterwards  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Derenath Enikinteel [Emef'Aitch]<BR>40+ Dwarven Cleric<BR>-=Bah yer na' 'urt, walk it off =-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>As you know, Luc, I use complete heal on tanks, and not just "super buffed up level 50 warrior" type tanks.  For complete heal to be the most mana efficient, you only have to heal around 1200 hps.  I don't have exact numbers, but I imagine most lvl 45+ melee types have that much unbuffed.  Add reso and even "just" pinzarn, and you've got 2000+ hps.  And if you are fortunate enough to get shaman buffs like health and talisman, all the better.<P>Obviously, the ten second casting time requires a bit of foresight, and, personally, I look at that as a challenge -- something that separates good clerics from great clerics.  Either you cast it well enough in advance so your tanks are not at any real risk of dying and you maximize mana efficiency, or you don't use it at all and revert to superior or greater heal.  There's nothing that says you can't change your spell load during combat, so if you decide complete just isn't going to work in a particular situation, swap it out with something that will.  Having said that, there are certain zones or areas in zones where I won't have complete loaded because I know I'd never get a cast off fast enough or without interruption.<P>Of course, every cleric is played differently, as evidenced by the spell loads posted on another thread.  Some people load 3+ heals, some load more stuns/DDs, some load defensive spells (DA/DB/gate).  With that in mind, IMO as long as you do your job and keep your party alive under reasonable circumstances, you are playing your cleric "properly" and anyone who claims that you are playing your cleric "ALL WRONG" is a pompous, closed-minded ass.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Garryk<BR>Level 50 Cleric<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>It seems that the last poster has the right idea to me.  Everyone has different styles of playing.  This is not a math test.  If you were having fun and your party was alive then you were playing ALL RIGHT.<P>I think you should have left that group; you didn't need that kind of crap.  You were the better cleric in one sense: you were nice. (and you are not stupid).<P>I personally think that it is better if multiple cleric in a group do have differing styles.  The other cleric could have been primary healer and you could have done more nuker for instance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I think it was you, Garryk, that showed me how efficient Complete Heal can be.  It's one of those spells I always keep memmed now unless for some reason I'm soloing.<P>The times I won't try to use it are:<BR>1) When the tank is coming back from a pull and taking a lot of damage very quickly.<BR>2) When I am not fighting in a controlled situation.  I usually hunt with a very good Enchantress, so most of the time we are only fighting one mob at a time.  This means I don't have to worry about the other people in the group too much and I can usually gauge how fast the tank is dropping and time my CH accordingly.<P>I have found that Complete Heal seems to taunt mobs less than Superior Heal.  Perhaps it's just the nature of my party or maybe it's because the heal is cast much later in combat that contributes to it.<P>I personally have found a lot of good things out from this board.  Sometimes I try something and it doesn't work for me, but often I learn a new trick that makes me a much better cleric.

</FONT><HR>I keep C Heal mem'd ONLY if there is a warrior in my group. Everybody else gets G Heal or S Heal.  My warriors do trust me to keep them alive and will always keep fighting no matter how low they are.  I've got my C Heal timed down pretty well and I watch how fast their health bar was moving down in the first place. If it's ticking down slowly, then C Heal is perfect, but if it's a caster that's taking them down then I will cast S Heal. Keep in mind that for warriors when they go beserk they've got an odd edge. On the one hand they are near death, yet on the other they are kicking slightly more ass. It's a bit of a bargain, but C Heals are used ONLY in controlled situations.<P>I've also been grouped with another cleric, whom I shall leave nameless but I'll just say he runs this board, who never lets me cast C Heal (he says I'm showing off). In the case of two clerics, I just don't keep C Heal mem'd at all. It just gets a bit confusing sometimes and I don't mind having the extra spell slot for something else like an extra stun.<P>When it all comes down to it, C Heal is a very valuable tool, but the situations when it can be used is a tad tricky. You have to know your group well and they have to trust you to keep them alive.  <P>------------------<BR>~Renmorum Lifespinner<BR> Karana Server<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ever since reading the couple of topics about complete heal I've started playing with it more (then usual).  I was in Sol B and grouped with a 48th lvl ranger and we decided to kill some bats.  I reso'd him and pinzam'd him too.  I was figuring, yeah, we can do 1 bat no problem.  Well the next thing I know we are doing 2.  I was a bit panic'd at first because I normally fight these things in mostly full parties and really had no idea how it was going to turn out.  So I sit back and assist the ranger and sorta start stunning the bat and medding.  He did an excellent job of taunting both baths and keeping them on him otherwise I think this would have ended differently.  I figured I needed to get the most out of my mana in this fight so I decided at the begining of the fight I would quickly mem C heal.  So even with 2 bats hitting this poor ranger I was able to time my C heals on him and I think I cast 3 complete heals on him for the entire fight.  Finished the battle at 20M (a little more then 1 C heal left), and all I did was med, stun, and C heal the ranger.  It was a damn fun fight.  Later that evening I rushed to the King room in Sol B to answer some calls of help (they pulled nox and got 2 extra bats and couldn't handle it all) so I heal them in the fight and others jumped a bat or so.  Battle was won and I tell the guy to drop the healthiest person and to add me to the group.  They do that and everybody was at 2 or 3 bubbles health.  I mem world of healing (the 49th group heal spell) and drain down to 2 or 2 and half bubbles of health myself.  Cast it and viola, the entire group is now at full or nearly full health.  They were very impressed.  I guess that hadn't grouped with a 49th+ lvl cleric before.  It was a hoot.  The guy that dropped out of the group was actually camping, so they immediatly asked if I wanted to join.  I was about to camp myself so I had to turn them down, but it was satisfying and funny as hell to listen to all the ooohhhs and aaahhhhs after I cast the spell.  Being a cleric can be really cool sometimes.<P>Dalain Brightgleam<BR>lvl 50 priest of M Marr<BR>Bristlebane<p>[This message has been edited by Dalain (edited 11-16-1999).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>From my observations:<P>Complete heal has two uses:<P>1) to abuse manastone<P>2) to heal tanks AFTER battle<P><BR>Only time I've used it is to heal a tank for 1500 hps after battle.<P>It's too risky to use during combat.  Don't leave your tanks hanging that long waiting for heal!! It's psychological torture.  Too many things can go wrong in the time it takes to cast.<P>Yeah sure, you use it all the time.. Good for you.  It's not the best use NOR the intended use of the spell.<P>GZ has said that he designed it so that you would NOT use it in combat.  I repeat NOT for combat.<P>Granted, you can use spells in new ways not designed for it, but you are insane to wait 10 seconds to heal a tank in an important battle.<P>Play how you like though.. if you like toying with your group's lives then by all means use complete heal in combat.<P>If your tank can wait 10 seconds to heal.. you may as well use super and med.. you'll get enough mana back to heal him again in 10 seconds anyway.<P>10 seconds is A LOT.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ridiculous.  CH is an excellent battle spell if used properly.  Nothing saves more mana than healing a ogre tank to full HP from one bubble of life with CH as opposed to 2.5-3 SH worth of mana.<P>I have been in battles taking the Lord in Guk with other clerics where we were both OOM after the battle.  The difference was that I used CH.  If I didn't save that mana, we would have died.<P>I have also been in a situation where a ranger was tanking the Lord most of the time due to the taunting effect of his YK's.  And on the occasion where the ogre warrior tank WAS taking damage, the other cleric was dumping SH's into the ogre warrior instead of letting me CH her.  End result, OOM, everyone dead.  Lord alive with a sliver of life left.<P>Now I dunno about doing CH on a caster like Traturn did last night...it probably requires a VERY specific set of circumstances such as he was in last night with FG's.  I find they have much less hit points to get your money's worth with and need to be buffed out the wazzoo (which they probably were last night too).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I'm not as high a level yet, but I've run into alot of things like this before.<P>When in multiple cleric groups, I've only dropped a group once, and that was when there were 3 clerics, and one couldn't bother to keep people buffed, and the two didn't want to work on combat at all, but instead, both wanted to heal the same people at the same time. (Seem a bit odd here?) During the fights, we'd get about halfway through and both would be going "OOM!".<P>I was playing combat through that one, and it took a druid and myself to heal the group through the rest of the fight. <P>I guess my two cents is this: Play as you will, just keep group safety first. If you're gonna be healing the same people at the same time, figure out who's doing what, and keep it that way. A little trust doesn't hurt. As long as everyone is living, and surviving, you're doing just fine  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"><P>For my own mess, I disbanded from that group and walked away. I figure they got two clerics, they can figure it out, it's not my job to try my luck fighting, and keep the group healed when others are OOM. Not a good deal to be in, and it was the only time I couldn't work with multiple clerics. Normally multiple cleric groups can really rock.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Shari,<P>First, never let anyone EVER tell you that you are playing wrong and tongue lash you to play their way.   If they do, kick them out of your group or leave.<P>I don't mind folks who have worked out an advanced technique who are willing to pass it on.  But someone telling me that only their way is right gets the boot fast.<P>I group with just my wife often and I group with a set of friends often.  At different times, with different groups in different dungeons, I fight differently.  When we fight in lower guk, I might have one heal and 3 stuns memmed.  When we fight hill giants I usually have 3 different heals memmed.  And I use different tactics.  I can be a battle cleric one night and a full time healer the next.  I even carry a few extra items that I switch on and off to match my goals (wis versus AC).<P>Heck at one point, we wer doing hill giants and pulled too much.  So I stepped froward and stopped one and tanked it while the others cleaned up and then we all worked on the unexpected guest.<P>Only the other players of EQ say that cleircs must be full time healers.  And yet against unead we are wizards.  We can also tank and absorb damage quite well.<P>Don't let anyone tell you how to play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>CH is the MOST mana efficient spell in the game.  Enough said.  USE IT.<P><BR>I have it memmed with SH, GH, and GRP H.<BR>Then root/enstill/immobalize(pick 1)is a must. Then both DA/DB vital.<BR>And one free slot for my leisure.<BR>(Usually ends up Gate or Symbol for me)<P>This combination is my personal favorite for grouping.PvP is an entirely different story.<P>Try it you'll like it...<P><BR>My rebuttal to all those nay sayers on killing a tank if you cant get off a CH.<P>You're either casting too late  or  you have much more time than you think.<P>A typical high level warrior has 3000 health after buffs.  Now remember, one bub (1/5) is 600 hps,  more than the average caster.

</FONT><HR>Chanwar, it looks to me as you're not using another ability that the cleric has: Stunning. Chain stunning, even...nothing like spending 60 mana on a stun, inflicting 50 damage and saving the tank from 400 points of damage, or aborting the Superior Heal the mob was casting.<P>Complete Heal is on my spell list when I have tanks that has over 2000 hp, otherwise it's not really worth it.

</FONT><HR>Complete Heal is an EXCELLENT spell, don't argue with me  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"> Once you get the timing on it down, you can use it almost exclusively. One of it's biggest benefits is that it is <b>NEVER</b> taunts the mob on you. When I was level 45, I powerleveled on oggok bouncers grouped with just a level 45 cleric. What we did was buff me up with Resolution, Armor of Faith and Symbol of Naltron (1700+ HP), then I pulled a bouncer and basically soloed him. Whenever I would get low on health, the cleric would CHeal me, healing about 1500-1600 HP. Bouncers never aggroed on him - although earlier, when he was trying to use SHeal, bouncers were smacking him around as much as me. Currently, in lower guk, fighting monsters such as the froglok king (for those who don't know, 45+ paladin, hits for 140+, heals, and lays hands), our cleric is using CHeal as much, if not more, than SHeal.<P>Gholam Stickyfingers<BR>50 Rogue, E'ci</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>  Stuns are great. The other night i was easily keeping dars in lower guk stunned the entire time (Sound of Force, Force, Holy Might). I used 20% mana to stuns and had to use ZERO mana on heals. <BR>  Cheal can be dangerous EVEN if you think you have the timing down. One premature nuke from a caster and he can be down in under 10 seconds. I've also never noticed more or less agro from the various types of heals. Warriors at this high level taunt and do so much damage that my heals rarely agro anything to me anymore. If you do the numbers Cheal is not mana efficent when used to heal under 1000 hps. With the LONG casting time further making the spell less combat friendly, its really quite clear what the best combat healing spell is. Also on plane and dragon hunts you cant forget to add in lag, which further adds to the negatives of cheal during combat. So you young clerics i would advise not to jump on the cheal bandwagon. I use Superior Heal in almost every occasion. LOADS more that Cheal. <P><BR>Badaf Brightstone<BR>50th level cleric<BR>Cazic Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>First, in response to Gholam on "never" getting a taunt from mobs after a CH, I'm afraid you are incorrect, my friend.  If there's a free smart-mob on a tank, as soon as you cast CH, it will turn on you.<P>My experience with CH is that I use it on tanks (preferably warriors) in controlled pulls.  When there are more than 3 and you are the only mob controller in the group, stick to SH for reliability and speed.  You may save more mana using CH, but the margin of error greatly decreases.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hi Lucretia, Garryk, and Dalain.  First thing kind of off the topic thanks Dalain for helping out with Luncan raid the other day.  Now I also use complete heal and I have done it in serveral places namely hate.  I had the pleasure of having Haldar in my group and the several casters.  Well I had the casters slow their casting down so that they did not attract to much attention to themselves and I had the best buffs on Haldar.  This put him close to 3000 hp.  Well i would wait till he was into the third bubble and begin the CH cast.  Most of the time he still had one bubble left of hp before CH went off.  I guess informing my group of my plans on healing let them know what they needed to do to stay out of trouble.  Even when we got trained I put one CH on Hal to let him fight longer which of course brought 3 mobs at me.  So i used da to anti taunt then and before I bit the big one I put one more CH on Hal.  I think this help them take down the ashbone drake which dropped a nice sk axe.  Anyways communication of your healing intentions will let you use the CH for excellent mana use.<P><P>------------------<BR>Xene Xtreme<BR>Halo of Fire<BR>Bristlebane<BR>50th Circle of Light <BR>Evil shall see the light of my Dawnfire<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Xene,<P>  My biggest help on Sir Lucan was buffing.  For some reason during the pull lucen killed me (not sure why he attacked, but I died because I was stupid ie didn't run to zone and didn't DA).  In anycase I was glad to help out, and I hope I can help Grimm slay Sir Lucan as well if the help is needed.  A good way to not take the faction hit for killing Sir lucan is to have Lucan kill you first. *snickers*  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif">  <P>As for complete heal, glad to hear you are using it.  Oh, hate and fear are the only places I put up both DA and DB.  They are great anti-taunts for when we pull more then 1 mob (also known as a train) and I heal somebody early.  They won't always save you, but they will usually buy you time for something to die and have someone move onto what's whacking you.  Anyway, complete heal is great, the casting time sucks, but the healing efficiency can't be beat.  If you let your group known what's going on it can be used almost anywhere.  I'm certainly glad I started using it more.<P>Dalain Brightgleam<BR>lvl 50 priest of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Bristlebane server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have seen CH used very effectively. Most strategies in the game that net unbelievable results are by nature quite risky however and should be aproached with caution. <P>In relatively open areas, a root or fear can be an excellent time buyer for a CH. With an enchanter in the group, the MOBs can be distracted long enough so that 10 second casting time becomes easily managed. <P>Also, as mentioned earlier, pets and charmed MOBs are downright scary when CH is casted on them. When your pet has 3000-5000 HP, that spell is a game breaker.<P>If the casting time is what is keeping you from using it, keep in mind that evacs and the like are also very high casting times. Do you wish your druid to stop using them as well? I think not.<P>Yil<P>P.S.

</FONT><HR>Nothing like responding to two month old threads.  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif"><P>I'm sure I've said this elsewhere, but I only use CHeal in reasonably controlled situations.  Of course, the levels of my tanks and the availability of another healer in the group are also factors to keep in mind.<P>The warrior I normally group with is now 41 (damn, I missed it), but even at 40 he always had 2,000+ hps.  So whenever possible, I would look for opportunities to cast it.  <P>An example, we're down to two mobs, one is well on its way down, and he's around 1/2, all others in very good shape.  I'd then ask the group to please let him take all the damage, and then mem CHeal.  Depending upon the rate of damage I'd cast either at 2 bubbles or 1.5.  Gotta let them go beserk a little, they just love that =P.<P>If I have another cleric I'm inclined to keep it mem'd, especially if the cleric is higher level.  He nukes, I heal (again, LGuk).  Of course, just hit 44, may have to re-think that....<P>If I'm the only cleric and the fights are tough CHeal might not get mem'd at all that night.<P>I too like AE Heals (only have Word of Health at this point).  One night the bard was working real hard to twist heal and mana song (I'm losing a tick here), so I mem'd woh, stoned down a bit, cast it twice.  Then let him know he could just mana song and afk if he wanted  <IMG SRC="http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I dont think i saw anyone happen to mention the fact that Specialize Alteration lowers cast time and mana cost even though its not stated in the spell book. So 10 sec isnt actual time when you have 200 specialize alteration. I agree with most people and i use complete heal often. I dont cast it in battles unless the group can handle the delay and if i cant get it off in time ill cast a G heal then cast complete and I never have a problem with it. Every situation is different and each of those are different depending on group class/lvl. Some groups i can cast it freely without worry, sometimes only after battles in which case ill mem it when i need it since it mems fast. If used wisely you can save loads of mana and your tanks will love you. Use it without caution and youll make enemies fast.<P>Shane 44 cleric<BR>Guardians of Antonica<BR>Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Shane, specialization doesn't lower the casting time on spells at all. It gives a chance for a break in the mana cost and gives you a better cance of regaining your concentration if you are hit, does nothing for casting time.<P>------------------<BR>Caleal P`Terak<BR>Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Casting CH with regards to non-aggo, is the fact that a MOB will remain on a target with 20%hp rather than 60% hp- which you would heal with sheal/gheal.  So, if a mob sees you gheal the target at 60%, they run for you. If you gheal at 20%, they stay on the tank.<P>Practice of CH is so important.  THe best proving grounds for this is in OOT and the Cyclops.  A friend (48 paladin) and I (43 cleric) soloed the ancient cyclops ph there.  I would measure hit damage mitigation vs the hp of the tank.  From that you can learn his breakout point when to start casting CH.  It took me about 8 fights to learn how to time the CH when he was at 1 bbl of health.  I believe that this is the ultimate solo technique for 2 ppl.  Not very practical in solB or lguk when you have damage sharing.  Nothing worse that a cleric who lets 3 tanks get to 30%hp in a fight trying to wait for CH to recycle.<P>In heavy combat situations, the team will try and get 2 main tanks to hold the train, while the rest augment them.  I only have 2 tanks to heal, casters don't overburn, and auxillary fighters (monks/rogues/rangers) work their magic.<P>I think the most important point about this CH spell is to communicate to your group what you are doing and that you assign someone to back you up if you get interrupted.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000037-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000037-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000037&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum2&number=2&thisthread=000037&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
