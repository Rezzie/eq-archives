<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">03-02-2000, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">East Karana - Gorgehounds are pretty good, the upper basement of Highkeep is pretty good, but usually over camped, Runnyeye is good with a group, but can get very trainy, Beholder is good - Mino's and evil eyes...<br />
<br />
For quests: Screaming mace - You're of a level where you can pretty much solo the warlord and emporer crush (Did this at 17 and almost died to the warlord then my group found me....) Halfway decent weapon, works for a few levels..<br />
<br />
Oh! Unrest! Just beware the trains! There's MANY good places to hunt at your level. If Unrest trains are killing you too much, step out to Dagnor's Cauldron and work on aqua goblins..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauntek</div><div class="date">03-02-2000, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm. Good question. I asked myself elsewhere,<br />
and was advised to go after Aviak Guards..<br />
alas, when I got over there, there was a group already attacking them. So, I logged and got some extra sleep. Alas, when I checked before work when there were only 400 people on, 4 of them were going after the Aviak guards -_-;;<br />
On the other hand, S Ro is annoying, as even with Detect undead, more often than not, it's Green mummy, green zombie, necro pet, dry!!..no, dry bone corpse. Another corpse, another necro pet, green zombie, another corpse another pet...etc.<br />
Then random greens and desert madmen attack <br />
you, and drain enough of your hp and mana getting rid of them that..wow! look! Dry bones that I can't kill now -_-;;;<br />
<br />
I suppose Highpass orcs might be a good semi-solo area, as groups form and mutate every few minutes there..<br />
Still looking for a place to go gain exp tho<br />
As for quests, you could probably start the cleric armor quests, grabbing all of the 'sitting out there' Icons and Ingots, so that you have them by the time you go after the higher level spawns...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talura cwn'Zeylon</div><div class="date">03-02-2000, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Experienced more from my rogue's standpoint than that of a cleric, but none the less I still met quite a few others my level there.<br />
Mistmoore, although it's become crowded there lately. Great exp, good loot. Just have to be careful of the Queen Cristianos Thex fachits if you're a schmurph. (Not sure if she's actually an important DE NPC or not, better to be cautious.) Some notes about hunting there, tho...if you hear a train announced, find a corner and hide (or zone if you're on the ramp); the walls of the pool area are good, and the cove beside the tower is also good.<br />
<br />
The aviak village in SK should be a hoot. (IMO not worth the time due to the campedness of the place, but lots of people still seem to stay.)<br />
<br />
Najena...wander in with a few friends, go smack bonecracker around, set up camp and pull the ogres and elementals. (This is a good one IMO, it is rarely a crowded zone.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Storm</div><div class="date">03-02-2000, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys for all your wonderful and helpful tips! I have took notes on what all you guys said. But where can I fight this guy for the &quot;Screaming Mace&quot;? And can I just keep coming back to kill this guy for more screaming mace's? I won't be able to use it cause I have a &quot;Enamelled Black Mace&quot; already! 700pp. for it ... that sucked! But with that and a &quot;Charred Guardian Shield&quot; ... that combo smokes that &quot;Staff of Observers&quot;  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif. Anyway any more input on this would be helpful. Thanks for taking your time to reply guys! Have a wonderful night! See yah, and take care!  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
