<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ethel Etana</div><div class="date">03-05-2001, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've spent this past weekend fighting in Growth and I had some questions.  The normal roaming mobs (Gale Wolves, Plains Steeds, Sanguine Kodiaks, etc etc) are all very easy.  The Protectors of Growth seem to be a pushover provided you've got 10 or so people at least and either someone to kite one or an Enchanter with Dictate.<br />
<br />
     However, what's required to do some of the &quot;named&quot; type mobs?  I know Ali and of course the mobs in Tunare's tree all seem to be Epic level encounters--but what about the others?  Rumpleroot, Ordro, Sarik the Fang?<br />
<br />
     I've yet to be on a raid where any of these mobs were engaged  (We were going to do Ordro last night, but too many folks had to log before we got the Brownie's clear).<br />
<br />
     Also, some general questions I've got.  What is the general idea on spawn times in Growth?  I've heard 24 hours, but the second night we were there mobs didn't start repopping until around 28 hours after they were last killed.  Is it somewhat random then?  Do the named mobs pop on the same schedule, or are they rare spawns?<br />
<br />
     Any information anyone has would be appreciated--even if I haven't asked specifically about it.  I've stayed away from this place due to faction concerns, but I'm there now, so trying to learn what I can as quickly as possible.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Oh, and if someone wanted to take a moment to list out some of the drop locations, that would be extremely helpful--specifically the location of the various BP and Leggings drops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">03-06-2001, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good luck on a BP. Spent a lot of time up there myself and cleric BPs seemed to be about as rare as Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse. Supposedly they drop from Thrifters but in all the time I was up there they never dropped a single one. Warriors are worse off since it appears that their armor is as rare as the cleric BP. I'm not sure, but I hope they up the drop rate on cleric BPs because I'm tired of watching SK BPs rot now...<br />
<br />
(Thriflings drop cleirc and SK arms, legs and BPs)<br />
<br />
Ordro - he's just a harder version of thriflings. No special drops. In fact, has same drop rate as normal thriflings.<br />
<br />
Sarik the Fang - guaranteed random arms drop.<br />
<br />
there's a guaranteed legs dropper that's named... think Gale something<br />
<br />
Tunarean Earthstrider - named treant. Summons ANY sylvanian still up. Make sure you kill them all before trying him. guaranteed random BP.<br />
<br />
Fayl - easier than Tunarean. Guaranteed random BP.<br />
<br />
Rumbleroot - 400 HP/sec DoT. High MR a MUST. Guaranteed random BP<br />
<br />
Ali the Elder - casts AE silence in dragon radius. AE silence prevents ALL casting for 15 mins. There is a rumor something will overwrite it but not really sure... Guaranteed random BP<br />
<br />
Thrifling focusers - 1 MEEEELION HP! I'm not kidding. 45 min fight. Dropped 16pp<br />
<br />
Guardians of Tunare - no clue about these. But there's 2 of them and they're 63+. I'm betting it'll be a tough fight.<br />
<br />
Tunare - *snicker* Casts AE silence over the ENTIRE ZONE. My bet is she has the max 2.3 million HPs too. If you find out what she drops you are the most uber person in EQ. Period. Not even FoH or Afterlife can kill her.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jassie</div><div class="date">03-06-2001, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">some additional information here:<br />
Protector of Growth: u need 1 person to kite one (dont dmg it, just snare). indeed there s a trick/bug to prevent its spawn... <br />
Guardian: quest npc i heard, no loot<br />
<br />
for BP, i would suggest Fayl. its doable with 2 solid groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ethel Etana</div><div class="date">03-06-2001, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank y'all so much for the information.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
    Rumpleroot and Ali the Elder I see up quite a bit as far as the mini bosses are concerned--but what about the others?  Are they rare/random spawns?<br />
<br />
    Also, any idea on spawn time of the &quot;roaming&quot; mobs?<br />

Got to be careful with timing because its one long fight with that few people (ie don't get PoGs or it'll get real exciting all of a sudden).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fycksir</div><div class="date">03-11-2001, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was there about 7ish hours yesterday, some observations. I was the pull group cleric on most pulls (you know, the no-stress position).  Our group was Monk, Bard, Wizard, Warrior, Mage, Cleric.<br />
<br />
Ordro and his Assistant went down easy, but the area was cleared out nicely ahead of those two battles.<br />
<br />
Water Nymphs gate and then summon...don't let them.<br />
<br />
Complete Heal aggro'd they hell outa stuff, phase pumas tore me a new one 8(.  Really only used it (CH) post battle or when someone was clear of all aggro (CotH'd).<br />
<br />
Celestial Heal and Remedy kept the health up and me alive pretty well.<br />
<br />
Had Hero/AoF or SoW/Naltron/MR on everyone as best as I could and CR/FR on the puller (the bard) when one of us remembered to give it to him. Buffs got outa sync with the LD's and deaths though.  With all that action there I had trouble keeping track of the buffs frankly, but it worked out OK.<br />
<br />
Mana did become a slight problem a few times,(Lev 53, 200 wis + a few mana items) after the buffs were redone.  But all the clerics were &quot;assist healing&quot; so we did ok. Threw in a few AE heals when the group got fluxed.  <br />
<br />
Wizards who snared were aggroed like holy hell. I lost mine a few times (sorry Onepz), he had Hero/SoW/MR/Naltron and sometimes even higher stuff.  Remedy was not fast enough to save him and with the damage he was taking the only thing I think that woulda worked is a &quot;pre-heal&quot; with CE, (then again prolly not)he went down FAST. Or maybe if death pact worked /rude Verant.<br />
<br />
The protectors of growth were a thorn in the side but were dealt with easily, sometimes one came, sometimes two.  They jumped me a couple times but I stood there and took it til the tanks got them off me.<br />
<br />
I used Immobilize a couple times in an attempt to save myself, it stuck, but not long enough to attempt Atone.  Stun and the upgrades also stuck, more than I thought they would, so have one or more ready.<br />
<br />
MEM BOTH BARRIERS, like you haven't anyway, but don't forget.<br />
<br />
Hope to go back there soon, it was intense at times but alotta fun.<br />
