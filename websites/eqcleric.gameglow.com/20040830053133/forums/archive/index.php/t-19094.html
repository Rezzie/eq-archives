PS. Needless to say since Drinal has pretty much be tapped for particularly high quality raiders, cross server applicants are highly encouraged. Do expect to be held to a higher standard as a xserver app though. We're looking for ppl who were already in the high end game (close to time lvl +) on their original server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you guys aren't all pissy are you? My current guild leader keeps threatening to TL me everytime I train the raid, like I&quot;m supposed to know the aggro radius of every mob in the game.<br />
<br />
And I drink a lot of beer so I have ninja afk a lot, but that shouldn't be a problem as I piss fast, you won't hardly notice I&quot;m gone. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
