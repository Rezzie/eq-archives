<br />
I am hearing from druids and pallies and so on, that the clerics are now the UBER class. We now rule the melee world... bla bla bla bla bla.......<br />
<br />
Well I am still only level 55 so no I don't so stop blaming me for KSing the poor monk in velks or something like that. I am still sitting on my behind medding for the next heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh thanks that helped. I will reach 56 sometime and get my new toy, but until that time I will just have to use my pet and heal.<br />
<br />
Now happy hunting every one</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont care if you have the new hammer that procs like mad - you will not out damage a druid/necro on a mob solo. I can do 6-7k damage EASY with the new dot stacking.. in 9 ticks or 54 seconds. If you can do that, i will eat my monitor.<br />
<br />
Your hammer is a toy, something to make your class more fun. I dont mean to lessen you upgrades, there nice. But the moment you step in the &quot;solo class&quot; ring, your going to get beat down by atleast 4 classes. <br />
<br />
Clerics have always been a good class.. but the most uber? thats an opinon and not one i subscribe to. And your &quot;hammer toy&quot; doesnt make you anymore uber then you were before. It just helps you melee better. It adds to a group.<br />
<br />
I see clerics solo alot more now but it takes 10 mins! lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And he will have a hard time digesting that monitor of his.<br />
<br />
I can do that kind of damage. Just chain cast retribution, how hard can that be?<br />
<br />
Btw, did you calculate ALL the dot's full time to work? I mean, how long from the last dot until it ends hereby taking into measurement the casting time of it.<br />
<br />
Get me the cleric that want's to solo all his time and I'll eat MY monitor - soloing is imho boring and should be done only when you are short on time or noone wants to group with you.<br />
<br />
Or you feel like doing something DIFFERENT!</div></div><hr />

I already knew you guys could nuke solo, you just didnt feel like doing it. Im talking strickly Melee.</div></div><hr />
