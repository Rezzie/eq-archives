<br />
Definitely explains why I lost so much from dying in 41 and not nearly as much in 42.<br />
<br />
Only problem is it stops at 50  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
GZ has posted many, many times that when you die, you lose a percentage of your *total* xp.. thats why when you die at 46, it looks like so much..its because you have a larger total of xp..so you lose a larger amount than you did earlier.<br />
<br />
So.. when you die at 45..you lose a % of your total xp.. when you die at 46..you lose a % of your total xp..which is alot more since you just went through the bump in the curve at 45.  However, you do NOT lose more xp from death at 46, than you do at 47..that is wrong.  At 47 you will have more total xp, and thus you will actually lose more at 47 than you did at 46.  <br />
<br />
This chart indicates that you actually lose MORE exp points at level 46, than at 47.  This is wrong, and GZ has posted such on many occasions.  I wouldn't put much faith in any of the numbers on this chart.. it looks like this guy just made up some equations that looked right, and posted.<br />
<br />
I looked back and it seems he is calculating the xp loss based on a percentage of what xp you need for your next level.  This is wrong according to GZ..he should be calculating the xp loss based on TOTAL xp gained.<br />

<br />
Not saying the chart is right or wrong, but it seems right to me.  But I'm definitely no expert on it.<br />
<br />
I have noticed levels where I have lost twice as much as other levels, and they weren't my hell level.  Which according to the chart is how it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Urijah27</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you lose xp in level 46, it looks more because of the way you see your xp bar move.  At level 46, you have just completed the bump in the curve, and your xp to next level is much less than it was at level 45.  Therefore, your xp 'bar' at 46 is 'smaller' than it was at 45.  However, even though your xp bars represent different lengths at 45 and 46, when you die the xp you lose will stay similar.. so.. when you lose X amount of xp in 46, it will look like a bigger chunk of the xp bar than when you lose X amount of xp in 45.  <br />
<br />
It is only the visual representation of xp that is confusing you.  You aren't losing more xp when you die, your xp bar is representing a different amount of xp needed for that level. Thus death xp loss looks like a bigger chunk of the bar at 46 vs. 45.<br />
<br />
Kind of hard to explain but I hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree, Urijah.<br />
<br />
I died once in 40 (a &quot;Hell&quot; level). I lost a quarter bubble of exp.<br />
<br />
I died once in 41. I lost a bubble and a quarter.<br />
<br />
I died 3 times in 43. I lost half a bubble each time.<br />
<br />
This isn't just perception, Urijah. The table does make sense, especially when you compare it to exp gain/loss in game. It wasn't my week and a half in 40 that made that bubble and a quarter look like a lot. It WAS a lot.<br />
<br />
Lastly, those numbers seem to represent percetages to me. If it's a fixed percent then the amount you lose every time would be the same. And, as other people are more than happy to point out, this wouldn't be the first time Gordon has been wrong about something in-game. Case in point (he said this today, mind you)<br />
<br />
 &gt;&gt;&gt;You can't twist invis with any other song... it negates it. That wouldn't work.<br />
Doh! Shows you how much I know about bard songs  They are the class in the game that I find the most mysterious.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Anyways, the table seems accurate based on my own observations. Have you seen different?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to quote GZ from time to time too, but on this issue he's definitely snowing us.<br />
<br />
Go over to www.hackersquest.gomp.ch (http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch)  and look at the forums there.  Regardless of how you feel about programs such as ShowEQ, these guys have definitively proven how XP is gained, and lost.  <br />
<br />
I'm going from memory here, but the issue with hell levels is caused because the XP/level multiplier takes a substantial leap on each hell level.  For the levels following the hell levels the jump is very minor.  Therefore, it might take some classes 4.5 million XP points to get through 30, while only 2.75 to get through 31.  With me so far?<br />
<br />
Death takes a percentage of your total, true, but the calculation is based upon your PREVIOUS level's XP requirements.  Therefore, when in a level AFTER a hell level the death calculations are based upon the Hell level's XP requirements, not only does it appear that you lose more, it appears that way because you DO lose more.<br />
<br />
Don't argue this here; go to the Hacker's Quest site and see what they have to say.<br />
<br />
My strongest advice: don't die in the level after a hell level (31, 36, 41, 46).  Sure, it's often unavoidable, but if you can do it the levels after Hell levels are the best time to get some of that &quot;safe&quot; experience.  Hug a zone line, go do the Seafuries in OOT, whatever.<br />

This lists xp info very accurately.  I believe you lose a set percentage of xp on death.<br />
<br />
I am also inclinded to believe Abashi's statement that they capped the amount of xp you lose upon death as to the amount a 50 warrior does.  It seems that less and less color is being lost when I die (and with a rez less and less kills are needed to get me back to where I was when I died).  Although I was just in 54 (which is basically Hell times 2) so I can't say for certain.  Color flow in 54 is verrry slow so going on perception isn't terribly accurate.<br />
<br />
Anyone else following the statement over at eqcastersrealm about xp in groups?  It's starting to sound like all the classes with an xp penalty are dragging everyone to their xp penalty in a group.  (ie. if it takes a bard 500 kills to level and a cleric of the same level 300 kills to level then they'll have to kill 1000 critters together to both level, however if the cleric was grouped with another cleric they'd only have to kill 600 kills together to level).<br />
<br />
That's what I got from the statement at least.  Interesting to think about anyways.  It's been speculation for awhile.  Not that it really matters much to me, I like xp penalty classes just as much as anyone else.  But it's food for thought.<br />

<br />
 to get level X total XP= X * Y<br />
<br />
At the hell levels the value for Y changes,but due to the way the system is set up you now have to &quot;make-up&quot; xp as if Y always had the current value.This clearly shows the reason for the hell level.I also checked the xp loss,but there is no method using a fixed loss percentage that mimics the double loss in hell+1 levels.<br />
<br />
I can not give actual in game numbers because i do not have them,but based on the information given by Verant i was able to construct mathematical models and run test numbers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A11e</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Experience loss is calculated as a percentage of your PREVIOUS level.  This is why when you die during the level directly FOLLOWING a hell level, you lose so much experience. Being a level 41, I have proved this first hand more times than I care to mention.  I had the same unpleasant experience (no pun intended) when I was level 35.  Verant is aware of the issue, they just don't care enough about their customers to fix either the hell levels or the double experience loss penalty following a hell level.  Verant thinks customer LIKE hell levels and besides haven't you seen the subscriber figures?  EQ is successful inspite of Verant, not because of them.</div></div><hr />
