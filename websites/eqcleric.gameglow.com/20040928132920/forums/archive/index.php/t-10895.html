I play on the Rathe, so as most of you know, the warders are perma killed. My guild has 15 keys now, and have killed motg 4x.<br />
<br />
Just wondering whats everyone's experiences with the primal drop rate on motg/prog/fa<br />
<br />
1/5? 1/10? higher?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Uh, bunches of FAs (maybe 8-10?) for one warsword. Got 4 primal avatar spells from the things too. Usually skipping Prog... Ventani to 60% is best so far, but it's going down  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Though generally we just skip the golems and head to the warders, so been a long time since we even bothered to find out.  The FA is generally stingy all around.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanilya Silverwind</div><div class="date">09-18-2001, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have gotten a primal of some sort at about a 1/4 or 1/5 rate so far from MotG/Prog/FA.  As far as primal warswords, its probably 1/15 or so for us.  Hammers and spears only drop from the warders in &quot;old&quot; ST as far as I know, so I have no idea what its like on Rathe or MM.  I have heard rumors of the golems being able to drop any primal once the Sleeper is awakened, but since I don't have any really reliable information I won't make any assumptions.<br />
<br />
Basically if the golems in &quot;new&quot; ST are the same as &quot;old&quot; ST, then you're looking at taking about 30x longer to get warswords, and no chance of getting spears or hammers as well as any other warder-only loot.</div></div><hr />

But it's about 1 in 3 for both 1h and 2h.  You'll always get more 2h though because their loot table is (supposedly) even and they drop two 2h (lance and axe) and only one 1h (warsword).  <br />
