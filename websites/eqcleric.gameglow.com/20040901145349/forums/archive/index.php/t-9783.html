<br />
Not to mention the jerk was saying they got 2 bubbles xp off the kill (Ya, right)!<br />
<br />
I know for a fact there is an xp cap, regardless of how red the mob is....<br />

Just boils my blood, worse than an LDC!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I make it a policy to atone the creature first. <br />

<br />
I guess my rant was more in the flavor of how annoying it is when some people just expect that others exist just for their convenience, and don't take into consideration that there is another person behind the char that just took the time out to help them...</div></div><hr />
