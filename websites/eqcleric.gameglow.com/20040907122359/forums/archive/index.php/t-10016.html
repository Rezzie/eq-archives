<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zzule</div><div class="date">07-01-2002, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I am sick to death of people who think my sole responsibility is to be their buff-dispenser!! More and more I just dont even want to play my cleric.  And that is really sad because the cleric is my favorite eq class.  But I have really had it with the people who seem to think players of clerics received a contract with eq that requires them to be full-service-buff dispensers. <br />
<br />
Just because I have the capabilty of casting a spell, that gives you absolutley no inherent right to benefit from said spell.  You want to be guaranteed a res/aego/whatever then PLAY A CLERIC!!! Or at least group with one for a freaking change. <br />
<br />
Daily I am assaulted with 'buff plz' 'hp buff' 'aego me'.  I feel kinda rude, but I have come to the point of just ignoring them.  No response of any sort.  They dont even bother to be polite 99.9% of the time. <br />
Just yesterday I had this happen: <br />
<br />
idiot_01 /t Zzule: 'Hey, I am just gonna exp kill myself here right behind you a couple times so you can rez me.  I just want to delevel enough that raptors will be better solo aaexp.'<br />
<br />
um....NOT.  I wonder if he bothered to ask me first or killed himself first.  I didnt look. I said 'no' and left the zone. What the hell did this guy expect.  'Oh wow!!! CAN I PLEASE res you?? goody goody goody!!!' <br />
At least it gave my guildies a good laugh. <br />
<br />
or the ever popular 'here is a peridot, you dont mind spending just the mana for aego do you?'  <br />
<br />
Right, I had no plans on using my mana for anything.  I would love nothing more than to sit my ass down and med up just for you to go solo!<br />
<br />
I see chanters selling c3 for 100 pp a pop ( hey, I buy it from em..) which costs them NO REAGENT.  Then, other idiots are trying to 'donate 50pp for aego.'  HELLO!!! AEGO COSTS ME 12PP!!! What makes you think your lousy 38pp donation for a buff that also costs me a TON of mana, is in any way adequate???  Pay ME 100 pp for my buff for a change, dammit. <br />
<br />
Another fun one, the old faithful 'it will only take 5 minutes of your time. Why wont you res me??'  Well, maybe I had plans that did not include wasting an hour on your sorry soloing butt?  You all know that '5 minute res' NEVER happens.  Is the corpse at my feet?  Are you making a donation to the Innoruuk Widow's and Orphans Fund (we need more of them..)? No? then NO RES FOR YOU!<br />
<br />
Lately I have been feeling really bitter and cruel.  No I dont want to buff you.  You dont want to group, you dont see me as a person at all, you just want to use me, why in the hell should I do ANYTHING for/with you?<br />
<br />
This was supposed to make me feel better but I dont think it worked.  /sigh<br />

<br />
People coming up for buffs/heals while I'm grouped are more annoying as I consider my mana to be group property at that point. <br />
<br />
Worst of all is being asked for SoW or Clarity. I mean standing there in plate and they think I'm an enchanter? These ignorant nitwits can get quite abusive when you try and tell them no. Last night I had a level 25 being abusive and jumping at me, and this was at WC druid ring surrounded by Druids and rangers who weren't even anon. <br />

LOL, I just /roleplay, hide my Dawnfire, and tell them I'm a pally. (lol, works on the n00bs everytime)<br />
<br />
I find myself ignoring a LOT of people. <br />
<br />
 I am beginning to HATE the word DONATE too.  When I look for a port or a TL,, its usually: /ooc paying 50pp for port/TL to ?? . SOOOOOOO many times have I made the mistake of answering the cry for a &quot;donate for rez&quot; call; do the deed, and get 18pp for it.  GRRRRRRRRR !!!!  I think I am gonna start charging 11pp per % of XP gained back and asking for it in advance.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kikamen</div><div class="date">07-05-2002, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no problem whatsoever with buffing people with my 54 Cleric. I am a Cleric, and I have buffs. Buffs are made to buff people. The only time I have a problem buffing is if I'm in a group like someone else said. Mana is easily regainable. Why make such a hassle over something so simple? Whining and complaining over giving buffs is just the same as a fighter whining because someone runs to him for help when they get overwhelmed with MOBs. They are armed with weapons, we are armed with buffs. My advice to all you clerics who whine so much about buffing, (Yes even the level 60 ones), Stop playing with your damn class then and switch to something more along the lines of a Warrior. Yeesh. You're given those buffs for a reason. Use them. Really....</div></div><hr />

Walk into a zone and shout &quot;xxth Cleric LFG&quot; do you get a group? . .  eventually you will but usually you get 20 tells for heals/rez/buffs. When in a group, I dispense thse freely, but otherwise you are asking me to take valuable play time to aid yourself with no return for me. Get real! Change class?, why not change YOUR atitude. WE ARE NOT SECOND CLASS CHARACTERS!!<br />
<br />
I would definently like to see one whole day when ALL the cleric go on strike. Think about it!! Oh and BTW we make fairly good tanks too!</div></div><hr />

I am tired of rude people who come up to me and say &quot;heal&quot; not can you please heal me or buff me. Don't get me wrong you will find me buffing and healing in Oasis alot of times and have helped lots of them by giving rezzes and heals and the help they need and want nothing in return. I just don't see why everyone seems to think that as a cleric I need to buff res heal on demand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ancarett</div><div class="date">07-07-2002, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say, when I'm at leisure and have the extra mana, I love to buff other people. But that doesn't happen too often and it certainly doesn't happen when I'm hunting for experience. My mana is usually the group's sticking point: if I blow it buffing someone else, that's all the more downtime for the three or four people in our party. Is that fair? I think not!<br />
<br />
It happened the other night, when I was in a camp in a dungeon, that someone pulled a train TO my group, demanded heals while the three extra mobs were joining in on my party.<br />
<br />
Ummm, no, Skippy. I'm at 30 mana which is just barely enough to keep my group alive with all these adds you've brought. You just die over there in the corner and I'll rez you when I get the chance.<br />
<br />
Cruel? No, I didn't know that player from Adam, they didn't okay this train to me ahead of time and I didn't have the mana to spare.<br />

You tell them to come to you. How is it wasting your time if THEY come to you, while you're hunting, (Which for the most part most clerics won't do out of groups anyway), and u give them a heal to lend a hand. As that is a clerics duty, to heal. IAnd, i'm sorry to say, but as a fellow cleric, we sort of are second class. That's what i like about them. I like being the unnoticed hero. Dunno, maybe it's cuz i get too much recognition in life? Either way, a Cleric's duty is to heal, people understand this, so people ask for it. Don't get me wrong, I don't heal EVERY person who asks for it, but I heal a majority, and when im sitting around doing nothing, or just running long distances, I click on  every person I pass, and if their HP is low, you bet your ass I heal them.</div></div><hr />

Peeps expect a symbol yet make no offer to help pay for it be it loot or just cash.. True i normally have money but why should I have to spend my hard earned cash on them? They wouldnt for me.  Had a wizard ask for Symbol I simply said do you got the dot for it? His responce was I'm not gonna waste one of my dots for that. umm.. wtf? lol..<br />
<br />
Next I was in a exp group we just dealt with a big train and I was oom. I made it very clear i was oom yet the monk kept pulling when he got low on health he FDed and asked what the hell was the cleric doing sitting on his ass. Nonetheless i got ticked and gave him a piece of my mind. Why pull 4 mobs if your cleric is oom? death wish?<br />

<br />
KEI is 900 mana.<br />
<br />
But yes, I think Aegolism is easily worth 100pp.<br />
<br />
A pox on all buff-beggars who want anyone to spend his or her mana (and peridots) on them so they can solo better.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amaryllis</div><div class="date">07-09-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kikaman a few problems arise with the &quot;you a cleric you heal people&quot; mentality. 1. When i am on, I am trying to level: wether in a group or soloing I NED THE MANA. 2. They do not come to me: Once I a person send a tell asking to Rez, I agreed (having nothing to do while waiting for group) and asked where his corpse was, no reply so waiting around 10 mins for this jerk to get his act together (Don't say he didn't know, he wouldn't even give a general area). 3. Those that do come to me just come up and stand infront of me: you can't ask you don't get. 4. those that do ask are very demanding and lack even the barest of civility.<br />
<br />
I also play: a Shaman, a druid, and enchanter. When playing these other characters I do not encounter the interuptions and demands upon my time and mana that I get while playing a cleric. Now you gonna say &quot;Don't play the cleric.&quot; I submit to you Don't ask me to heal/buff/ rez you.<br />

My friend, a 60 enchanter has it worse imo. She'll die on a raid, sit down in bazaar to mem spells and is already hailed to death and bugged for c3. <br />

I don't know how much ruder you can get ... bugging a person who is naked, obviously dead and hasn't even had the chance to mem a thing.<br />

I set it up as a hot-button on every page. When I join a group I run it on everyone. I only ask classes and levels if someone is /anon or /role. I never (well hardly ever) run with those up yet the number of times I get asked either for inappropriate buffs (SoW or Clarity) or just asked my class or level is appalling.<br />
<br />
My reason for not going /anon or /role is simple. I've got some really good groups from people doing a /who all cleric for my level range. People who know how to use the system like that to find a group member are usually pretty competent players. <br />
<br />
Maybe when I'm higher level and able to deliver the really high exp rezzes or expensive buffs then my attitude will be forced to change.</div></div><hr />

LOL, now that I'm 49, I have a way to deal with people who want sow.  I mem shield of words and cast it on them.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  My standard reply before that was 'If I could sow you I'd be the first sowing dwarf in the history of EQ'<br />
<br />
As for buffs I actually *do* have, as far as I'm concerned, it's my mana, I buff whomever I choose.  Usually if I have the mana I'll buff anyone (except symbol), but I've even been in groups where I didn't buff any group members.  I was in a 5-melee and me situation in OT once, and none of the melees felt like stopping the chain pulling long enough to let me get the mana to buff them, so I just didn't bother.  When the dragoon wandered by and wiped the group (minus me, who DA'd and then gated), they reconsidered their position.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Some slobbering fool (this is the rant forum, hope it's ok to really let my hair down) will ask for it for themself!<br />
<br />
Last night in Chardok some flea brained nimcompoop asked my druid to cast PoTG on him.  On him alone.  A 1200 mana buff!  I asked him how he intended to replace the 1200 mana it cost.  He tried to give me a SBS, but I already had one.  I hit cancel on the trade.  I was just so torqued off that someone would be so selfish.</div></div><hr />

Somebody did that to my druid not to long ago.  I went Wolfform and went to stand next to him.<br />
<br />
He had no idea what I was doing... somebody nearby did, though, and started telling me to &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;shake&quot;, &quot;speak&quot;, and so on.<br />

The first thing I see is a low 50's monk soloing in the front.  I sighed right then and there because I knew what was about to happen.<br />
<br />
He finished killing his mob and then saw me.  &quot;Can I have aego please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I was not in a good mood and thought about all those clerics LFG and not getting one because people rather solo.  So I responded &quot;I'm sure there is a cleric LFG somewhere that would love to buff you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I left it at that.<br />
<br />
Well the next thing I know 10-15 mobs were trained to the zone.  Hmmmm wonder how a monk could do that when they could FD if they had a REAL problem pulling.  I think he was shocked to see us dispatch all of them so easily.  He thought there was going to be some kind of wipe out!  LOL we just said &quot;thanks for pulling for us&quot; and went on our way.<br />
<br />
Of course I petitioned him and in only 3 hours I got a response back.  The guide didn't do anything but say &quot;Hi,hows it going!  That sucks...well I see he's not in the hole anymore...have a nice day.&quot;<br />

I am SICK of not being able to get a group but being expected to buff/rez soloers.  They have a right to solo but then they should realize that it comes with limitations.  If you want the benefits of a cleric, share the xp with someone who can't solo.  From now on my answer is &quot;I'm sure there is a cleric LFG somewhere who would love to buff you.&quot;  THANK YOU!<br />
