<br />
When I checked on responses on my equipment update thread, I got this:<br />
<br />
&lt;&lt; Best thing you can do to upgrade, make a drood...&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
While reading a post from a person who wanted to start up a cleric and was asking for advice on starting stats there were plenty of posts telling him basically not to bother making a cleric.<br />
<br />
Even if the rest of you dont, I enjoy my cleric. I read this because I want to be a better cleric, and its insulting when I'm told I shouldn't bother. *sigh*<br />
<br />
It boggles me why fellow clerics are discouraging people from playing clerics.. why would one bother playing a cleric if that was the case?</div></div><hr />

While I completely understand and sympathize with the uproar, it's currently drowning the board.  I'm wishing we had a forum just for the 'class balance' discussions currently taking place.  Still, it WILL die down, it will just take a few days.</div></div><hr />

The class has much to offer and to those purists who play the game to enjoy it and to roleplay or to have fun with friends the cleric is viable. The cleric will always be viable in the high end game for the res capability. <br />
<br />
Most of those unfortunately are going to be two boxed clerics because most of the old timers have vanished and gone onto better things. <br />

<br />
<br />
The other priest classes in particular the druid class has argued for an upgrade in healing for quite a long time. Some say justified others not. The argument ran that the priest classes were roughly 70 to 75 percent the healers of Clerics and there fore should still be the same throughout the entire game. Scaling as it were to steal a phrase from another much as complete heal scales to the game.  <br />
<br />
There is valid points to this argument. They did melee balancing and look at what happened to the desireability of warriors in exp groups. Paladins and ShadowKnights were long long overdue imo. <br />
<br />
So now the other two PRIEST classes get a 75 percent complete heal and Clerics will go the way of the warrior.  (I could be mistaken in that number because the spell still is only on test.) So think about your actual need at 54 and higher. Most experience grinds and increasingly more dungeons are easy enough to be handled by druids and shamans as the main healer. If you do not have a close knit group of friends that you play with on a regular basis forget getting pickup groups in outdoor zones or other popular dungeons because your contribution to a group is nill. Chances are the only reason you will be asked to goto a zone is to res someone and if you are not 56 or higher then forget even that need. <br />
<br />
I like my cleric. I like playing my cleric to his utmost potential. My potential is healing and the ability to make snap decisions. The quick decisions are no longer needed as the game has gotten easier and healing is no longer my bread and butter. <br />
<br />
Do not throw ressing back at me either as more than likely the pickup group has a bot cleric camped out somewhere close (if not allready in group) to provide that needed service. <br />
<br />
Bitter, aye, perhaps more so than some of the bitter druid brood because in their quest for perceived fairness they have made my class obsolete.<br />
<br />
So now I get to watch this drama from afar and yet again listen to Verant/Sony bow to the wishes of a select minority as they yet again cater to the power gaming crowd without thinking of the implications this will have on the non uber. Political Correctness has run amok at Verant/Sony.<br />
<br />
Be well and safe<br />

I'm no expert on gear appropriate for your level, so Ill pass. <br />
 I will say that when I get to just group with friends, after knowing them all this time, it truly is a rewarding time and good laughs. After all, thats why we play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mordlin</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quotison I understand what you are saying, I like my Cleric too but like the others here I am just plain disappointed by VI's abandonment of our Class. I'll try and suggest some stuff that may help equipment wise.<br />
<br />
I found the best thing I ever did was go for Wisdom and AC. Ac is your friend especially on larger raid type mobs who will rampage heh, and getting hit less or at least for less damage means you can heal for longer without being interrupted.<br />
<br />
Try and go for Thurgadin quest armour to start off - either hunt the Arena with a couple of groups/guild or hunt the giants at the start of where they begin to see invisible with a well balanced single group. Buy multiquests if you can afford it  - its good ac and stat gear with some nice effects.<br />
<br />
Get a shadel bandit ring. They are great, Look out for a lotus vine necklace (ac7 +9 wis +45 mana) they are great, get an earring of the solstice!<br />
<br />
If money allows buy some cultural armour for your race/deity or even make your own (smithing).<br />
<br />
Dragon bracers are good  - good ac and charisma and wisdom (worked through to matchelss) see if you can find a bracer of sense.<br />
<br />
Donals is.....sucky! I keep boots and arms in my bag - boots for sheer fun or AoE groups, arms for free heals or pet buffs (not wasting aego on a pet!)<br />
<br />
Primary hand doesn't have to be a weapon - I use Writ of Dragonkind because I don't have my epic (Sleepers Tomb drop) Secondary I used sarnak batle shield for ages (still do for resists) or crystalline shield. Range slot a Gantru Charm (Umbral Plains) is fantastic (neck or range slot too), currently I am using a frozen orb because of the 40 mana (well over 255 wis unbuffed I am lucky)<br />
<br />
Get the best you can afford to get but make sure you really invest in good stuff. 1 really good item is much better than 5 mediocre ones in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I hope this helped a bit. Try making a Magelo profile and 'equipping' yourself in stuff that looks good. it's a great way to see what areas to improve and drool over some dream items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">excellent point Quotison.<br />
Even though the stuff we are getting bothers me , im still having a total blast playing a cleric.<br />
<br />
For example last two weeks have been around the best days of my playing time.<br />
Been doing the hardest stuff with my guild we have done so far (Clearing NTOV)  and we have had great fun doing so.<br />
<br />
Even though the changes will come i wont stop playing my cleric, hell! i wont stop until i get bored..and frankly i dont see that happening anytime soon.<br />
<br />
I encourage everyone here, even though yer feeling abit down by all this, to continue the high standard of friendship that this forum has had.<br />
<br />
We are all abit screwy for playing clerics but we dont care!<br />
Just think about this, if yer having fun, then yer doing something right.<br />
<br />
<br />
and one last thing, please dont tell young clerics that are struggling with their equipment and lvl´s to start another class...that is so sad to see.<br />
<br />
My cleric wasnt powerleveled and hadnt any twink stuff, hell i still remember how proud i was when i got my full bronze! then the golden cleric armor and so on.<br />
<br />
Please keep that in mind ;)<br />
<br />
SKAL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Bertoxx</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When it's raining for a few weeks and the river is flooding your town you'll most certainly not go to the McDonald's to ask for a menu, would you?<br />
<br />
It's the same situation here now. Just wait till the flood is gone and then you'll get quick answers to your questions, with the occasional rant of people who lost their business in the floods.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ludashanus</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am my cleric. I'm not sure what floods have to do with anything. I have not played EQ for sometime due to various reasons, but I love the distraction. Someone once said to me, &quot;A tree is a tree with branches.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have no idea what this means, so I bonked him on the head.<br />
<br />
Someone else said, &quot;once you gain in power you get more powerful.&quot; When he was NOT drunk, he said &quot;a cleric's power grows as more people realize what they can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I never go anon, because then I forgot what class I am and level and start playing a Woodelf Druid and I'm a dwarf... It gets so confusing. So, I've been getting all sorts of tells from people I barely know saying something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, friend can I ask you a favor?&quot;<br />
I usually reply who are you, friend.<br />
They then ask me for a res 86 zones away, on a different server, while surrounded by dragons and angry GM's (or something ridiculous like that).<br />
<br />
I have power. POWER!!!! HHHahhahahahahah!<br />
<br />
Ok, now that I got that out of my system. (Get it system, computer...I kill me....)<br />
<br />
My point? Avoid floods, eat more fast food, bonk people on the head and make up excuses. &quot;Hey, sorry I meant to bonk that other silly ranger with the big mace&quot;.<br />
<br />
Or...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry to have bonked you. I meant to hug you, but hit the wrong key.&quot;<br />
<br />
So you see? My advice is stupid. Why are you reading this gibberish? You should be going out there playing your cleric and having fun. Trade gold to rats and snakes, armor to beetles, have fun watching people wither and die....oops, I'm NOT playing a necro.<br />
<br />
If people get you down, then go to Kaladim and the dwarves will bring you down to a reasonable level....like 3 or 4 feet. Travel to West Commonlands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Die! Die! Dark Elf! Mean Dark Elf! Die! Who's the Dwarf? I SAID who's the dwarf? Who let the dwarf out, who, who, who, who, who! I am the Dwarf! Kile Dem (or whatever his name is), you are MINE!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Or perhaps I got too excited. Seriously I died so many times because of that stupid dark elf and when I finally hit 51st (signature is wrong) I was so happy! I finally used shout to make people laugh, rather then them standing in front of me laughing....<br />
<br />
...and I never said anything.<br />
<br />
*Lud shakes his head in confusion.<br />
<br />
So don't let people get you down...get it down,...and I'm a dwarf.... i kill me....<br />
<br />
You're a cleric, the best class around and if anyone says anything different bite them on their kneecaps! Of course, I'd recommend removing their armor. I lost a tooth doing this and had to get it replaced by a Goblin. Hey, us clerics are a poor lot and these Goblins are so eager for self-improvement. I can now whistle by taking in a deep breath. Fun at parties (get it parties....I kill me...ok I'll stop), but dangerous in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Well if you're a Dwarf, well you got it! If you're not and are probably a stupid high elf (no offense intended you goof...oopps) then I'll try to disrupt your dwarf envy.<br />
<br />
Have fun!<br />
What's that behind you?<br />
