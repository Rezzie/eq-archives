<br />
I'm coming up on last hell level shortly here and wanted to refresh some good ways to get through it.. so far from what I've heard I'm thinking either<br />
<br />
A)  Spectres<br />
B)  Bats/Bugs in SolB<br />
C)  Solo Kobolds in SolB<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viscera</div><div class="date">02-09-2000, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely solo kobolds in Sol B. I have the luxury of playing at a slow time (early AM), and it is easy to camp the window or pool rooms. At 45, I was able to kill two easily with a full bar of mana. Root one, kill one, kill the other.<br />
<br />
GK's 3 casts of retribution, and one force, usually melee for a round or two.<br />
<br />
GK shamans 2 casts of retribution, one force or several melee rounds to finish them.<br />
<br />
The downtime kind of sucked, but if you have access to clarity, it's pretty good exp. Somewhere in the vicinity of 1 bub in 3hrs, slightly more time without clarity.<br />

You might be able to kill 2 in a row IF, and big IF, your roots hold a long time and you get full DD everytime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">03-08-2000, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The magic resist on them is too high IMO.  I'd solo in Guk before I solo'd in Sol B.  Frogs and Doggies are about the same exp (kill a blue wan about = to killing a blue GK), but more mana efficient with Banish than Retribution. Specters are great exp too, at 44 I could take on two in a row before medding and still have enough mana ot heal myself if I needed it.<br />
<br />
However,  I would suggest that you group.  Guards are great exp, as are different rooms in any dungeon.  I did bags/bugs in Sol B for 8 hours one day, 7 hours the next day and was done with 45  (2 clerics, 2 tanks with planes gear, 1 mage with pet, 1 enchanter).  This was before Sol B became so camped you couldn't find a pull though....<br />
<br />
If you can get into the Lord or King rooms in Guk, or the SS or DB room in Sol B do it- great exp.  Seafury Cyclopes are good too, and can be done in a small group (one tank + you).<br />
<br />
One place that is never camped that is great exp (although you need to find people you can trust), is Kedge.  Best people to bring to Kedge: One Druid, One Enchanter, Two Tanks (preferrable one is an SK/Monk and the other is a warrior), and any other class (Necro, Magician good for pets, or wizzie to blast).  Great experience, no waiting around for things to spawn.  If you have a feign puller, pull non-stop.  The classes: enchanter for clarity, augmentation, crowd control and back-up EB; druids can charm sharks and fish, evac, and EB; The feign puller to get singles or doubles (the enchanter should be entergency crowd control, don't always rely on it); and of course the cleric, well you heal/buff or sit and med!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viscera</div><div class="date">03-10-2000, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zaxus, trust me. I spent a lot of L45 soloing in Sol B. Guk is definitely doable, but due to the larger amount of trains, and the fact that you can't pull from a room (like savant) solo until L47, AND the fact that the zones are really far, Sol B is much more suitable for soloing. Retribution almost always did full damage (501) for me. Root holds a fairly long time if you just park it somewhere. Sometimes you will have to re-root, but it is only 30 mana.<br />
<br />
The above tests results were based on around 190-195 WIS.<br />
<br />
I didn't PREFER to do two dogs at the same time, but it was doable. Again, best spots are the upper window room, pool room, or any of the rooms near the Sol A zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never did the soloing specs until L50, when only about 20% are blue, but I would definitely do those anyday to dogs. 3 Banish, plus up to an extra 150HP damage for the toughest ones, and you are kicking. I heard all about the root and fear technique, but for me it is just standard root/nuke. Most will break after one nuke, but it really isn't that big a deal.<br />
<br />
Last thing I want to mention. I normally play in the early morning hours (7am-1pm CST), in which those areas of Sol B are ALWAYS uncamped. Too many MOBs in Guk, as you WOULD have to clear a room to start killing. During primetime however, I would recommend Guk, as it is easy (although long at times) to find a single wan in a hallway. Also, same thing at the spec cave in Ferrott. Go into the cave and pull a solo spec.<br />

Needless to say, with a wisdom of (sigh) 165...I need to get some efreeti boots...I could kill 2 Kobs with a full bar of mana...If a 3rd showed up I enstilled it and medded...<br />
GK 3 retributions and some hitting...usually not much<br />
Shaman 2 rets <br />
I was only resisted a few times...and I made about 150pp per bar http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">03-21-2000, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sol B by far.  People wonder why I live there.  Even at level 47 I can solo kobolds and get exp, and the loot.  I use a different method then the one listed above.  Mine is:<br />
<br />
Force (87 dmg)<br />
Wrath (218 dmg)<br />
Holy Might (57 dmg)<br />
Wrath (218 dmg)<br />
<br />
then repeat.<br />
<br />
Mana used on each kobold:  2 1/2 bubbles.<br />
Resists are normally pretty low.<br />
The stun lasts just long enough to work super effectively.  There will be a millisecond between the wrath and next stun where they will be able to hit you, but if you're buffed, it's no biggie.  Most health I lose is 2 bubbles (that's if they have resisted) and 1 bubble if no resists happen.  I started being able to completely soloing these at around 45.<br />
<br />
I started in Sol B at lvl 35, and am still there at 47.  Whenever I can't get a group (and on Karana, that is become more and more often because there are 100+ in every zone) I solo kobolds.  Good loot (all bronze pieces save for the bizarre and sell for 5PP to the newbies instead of selling to the vendor for under 5PP), lots of PP and many many other good loot :)<br />
<br />
Also, finding an enchanter to give you the occassional clarity seems to be pretty easy in Sol B.  I always ask nicely, pay with either the pages they need (which drop in Sol B) or pay them 5PP per cast of clarity.  Makes soloing go even faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pantheus</div><div class="date">03-22-2000, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty much soloing thru 45 in L Guk. There is more than one spot where a smart cleric can solo without much competition. The exp is great, the loot isn't bad, and I think our undead spells are more mana efficent than the DD stuff. Keep invis vs undead mem'd and remember to back into a corner if you have to gate (I'm bound at the dead zone so I can dive out to clear any aggro'd mobs before they hit the zone, no trains). Gating thru 4 frogs beating on me is a common occurance, if I'm backed into a corner. And the sauce for the goose... you're real close by when the Lord or Frenzied groups shout that they need a cleric. L Guk loot is much better than SolB IMNSHO.<br />
