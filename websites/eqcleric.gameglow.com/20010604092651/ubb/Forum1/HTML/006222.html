</FONT><HR>I fully expect a lot of nitpicking, teeth gnashing, chest thumping, etc over my latest post.  So please feel free to vent over it.  I'll happily respond if necessary.<P>I did want to clarify one point here though: why I think it's fair.  It's fair because it affects all characters equally.  For example, if uber-guild We Roxx0rs U is handling it on a rotation with guild Forever United (aka FU) they MUST have the force their at all times to kill Ragefire.  If they don't feel free to waltz in and take him (I'm sure they don't hesitate).  Eventually they will run out of Cleric twinks to equip with epics and move on.  And if they don't that is the sort of issue that gets a GMs attention.<P>Ragefire can spawn at any time, therefore giving overseas players a shot too.<P>Yes, it makes it hard on the "casual" player who has a job and family, but Verant has never exactly catered to that segment of their customer base.<P>They are treating every customer equally: you can either have what it takes to get the mission accomplished when the opportunity arises, or you don't.  Period.<P>Disclaimer: I wish it were otherwise.  I don't particularly like sitting in game doing nothing, and I despise asking people to do nothing with me.  If you read the front page you'll see that I made a number of suggestions to nerf the quest, in addition to alleviating the backlog (Absor doesn't read that closely I think).  I really wish they would do something.  Hell, I'd be happy to have an <i>Water Sprinkler of Little Ankh</i>, 1 dmg, 40 delay, -10 to all resists, Effect: Revivisence.  The stats are nice, but the effect is what I'm interested in.  But I'm not going to waste any more energy on something I cannot change.  I will instead deal with the quest as it exists.<P>Good luck all,<BR>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well I see your point, in saying that when he pops one group has 5 minutes to hand in the pearls, then it moves down the order.<P><BR>and this is all well and good in thoery, but if rage spawns at 4 in the morning sure alot of the uber-guilds people may be on, but what about pardon the over used expression "us little guys"  I am in a guild with friends that are frankly the only reason I play the game.  I would like an epic but if they'll keep me around with out then I'll be happy.  <P>I can under stand that we have an easy quest, but I mean c'mon its not THE easyiest, and its not the hardest.

</FONT><HR>Considering how much high level play seems to revovle around having a Cleric, Verant is going to have to act fast if there is an exodus when other games come out that draw us away.  That means they will have to either give Resurrection type spells to other classes, or encourage people to continue playing their Clerics.  With AO coming out at the end of June, I expect a shortage of Clerics to follow in about a month.  Two weeks for Clerics to leave for greener pastures, then be replaced by retired Clerics, and then another two weeks for the retired Clerics to get tired of a class they gave up on.<P>Adding pressure to an already high stress class is foolish.  We bear a large share of the cash sink burden of the game, we bear the resurrection burden of the game entirely to help deal with the resurrection burden, and then have to deal with rare spawns while others deal with made spawns for most quests.  Verant currently places high time demands on the Cleric class, whether it be leveling or quests.  This is yet another example of their indifference to the seriousness of the burdens they place on the Cleric class.<P>Sorry Rayne, I hadn't noticed that this wasn't on the Rant forum until just now.

</FONT><HR>All I can say is, thank God I hail from the Luclin server, the home of Everquest's ONLY 100% universally-followed Ragefire Rotation List.<P>If your wondering what I'm talking about it is found here: <BR> <A HREF="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=587.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub6.ezboard.com/fluclin71335dragonsandtheplanes.showMessage?topicID=587.topic</A> <P>Basically, this list was constructed by the major guilds of the server, since obviously any kind of Ragefire agreement would have to be signed off on by the major guilds to work. Miraculously, it has happened, since *February*, with dozens and dozens passing through the list, with no cheating or KSing at all. Even more miraculously, our Ragefire rules are tailor-made for the little guy, the small guilds, people with Real Lives, unguilded folks with lots of friends. Our list's rules are such that the "uber" guilds would benifit a lot more without the list, which makes it even more amazing that the list hasnt been broken these last 3 months. I wont say that our community is somehow nicer or better than average, I would be biased and that statement would be self-serving, but still, its pretty remarkable.<P>Consider the basic rules: You are verified to have the shimmering pearl, you show that you are level 50, you get put at the bottom of the list. Notice the absolute lack of any mention of guilds. This is not about guilds, this is about the clerics of Luclin, and getting as many epics into the server as efficiently as possible.<P>When you reach the top, your butt goes to solb or lavastorm, and you camp ragefire. If your online at all, a /who all yourname had better show you being there, or one of your monk alts if you got one. If you cant be online due to RL, or sleep or whatever, your guild or friends need to be watching it with some kind of a way to contact you. In short, if your found every day on exp camps or lots of raiding during your turn, that obviously looks very, very bad. Countless clerics who have graduated through the list have put in their dues, the cleric at the top is expected to pay the same time commitment price.<P>Now the important part. He spawns, the server will generally grant you somewhere between a 3-5 hour grace period to get folks together to bring down Ragefire. More time if in a bad time of day (4am) Less time at the peaks when you should have less of a problem getting a raid together. The list is generous to those clerics who traditionally would have almost no chance on other servers, but a line has to be drawn somewhere. If 3-5 hours are not enough for you to get a Ragefire raid together in normal circumstances, the next in line gets his chance. The server isnt going to tolerate having Rage up all day long.<P>The only exception to this grace period is if a downtime is going to happen within 5 hours or so, or if naggy's possible window of spawning is within the next 5 hours or so. In these cases you absolutely had better be online and ready to kill him soon, or all rules are pretty out the window, as the server is facing the possibility of a wasted RF. Those are pretty much the only times Luclin ever reverts to standard practice of other servers, and only for that brief period. Thats really the only time we've had a minor problem on the list, when Ragefire spawned one day, but naggy was due up that afternoon. The cleric at the top was not online. Ordinarily he would have been given a bit of time to show up, but in this special case, that cleric lost his chance and had to resume his turn later that day when he logged on to find Ragefire killed to beat Naggy's respawn.<P>Weve had some problems and close calls, legitimate arguments about the list's fairness, but each time things were adapted just enough to make things work out and keep the idea alive. (For example, originally the list had no shimmering pearl requirement and people were signing up who hadnt even killed Overking yet, that threatened to kill the list big-time. Requirement was added that in order to get on the list, you had to be ready to spawn the final fight, and disaster was averted.)<P>Very occasionally, we will get challenges, intellectual arguements against the list every 3-4 weeks or so. The most amazing thing about it, is these arguments never really come from our "uber guilds" (of which I guess I'd be a member of one of them) who would benifit most from trashing the list and messing up "the little guy." Usually, these arguments are met with surprisingly fierce resistance, none of those guilds who really could do damage to the list are swayed, and some of us come to places like these eqcleric boards to find horror stories to repost over there, reminding people just how good we've got it, and what exactly we are trying to avoid. (and succeeding)<P>I admit this probably wont work elsewhere, the only reason it worked for us, aside from Luclin being unusually more calander-driven than most servers, was that it was established early. The server really has not known anything except the list. Getting on the list. Camping ragefire on your turn. Helping the one on top, no matter what guild they are in. A server which already has been thoroughly scarred with bitter fights over Ragefire, probably theres no way this could be established with universal agreement.<P>Of the last two clerics to complete the epic on Luclin, one was in a teeny-tiny "family" type of guild, and the other was unguilded with lots of friends. When they needed help at the end, they were able to get that help across partisan and guild-lines, including lots of assistance from the "uber" guilds which this list maybe doesnt benefit more than the FFA alternative. That really is a neat thing to see as being possible. It's a shame most servers are unable to do this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>And this, is probably the major benifit to the "uber guilds" on Luclin from this list. In a FFA system, if a guild has a cleric waiting for his epic, that guild has got to have the place staked out and monitored round-the-clock. That guild cant have any fun in far-off distant lands, no instead they are relegated to exp-grind camps, being "on call" to sprint a mad dash to Solb on the drop of a dime.<P>On Luclin, there is no stress because the competition has been strictly regulated out of the picture by universal consent. Your cleric goes to solb to begin his or her own little personal hell, and the guild is free to be able to do their own thing and have some real fun with raids. When you dont have to worry about another rival guild beating you to Ragefire, it becomes so much less stressful for everyone involved : )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Thanks for stepping up and saying something Rayne.  It is a crappy way to go about things but it is the only way really.<P>Untill a bit ago I didn't even think of getting the epic (small guild and not enough time on line to do the quest or generate enough friends to take down the quest NPCs)<BR>Now I am in a guild strong enough to help me with the more difficult NPCs, but I doubt I will start the quest the anytime soon.  I'm generally an average player.  Most days I only get a few hours in, but that is mainly by choice, and I've spent countless hours on camps before, but after almost 2 years the game just isn't as entertaining and my social life has come out of it's coma and now only needs oxygen tubes to keep it alive.  So my EQ time is a bit limited.  ... going off topic, just wanted to make the point I'm not a "hardcore" gamer and am becoming more so the casual gamer.<BR>The epic would be nice, but I don't need it. There are plenty of other clerics on my server with it.  True only one of the three 50+ clerics in my guild (hopefully I will eventually be in that group) has it, and he isn't on a whole lot, but raids managed before without it.  I must say it's nice after your inexperienced PoS raid spawns Sirran before killing all the other faeries and then procceeds to pull another faerie past him (glad I went LD right before it happened, although I doubt I would have had time to heal anyone and get agged myself), having a cleric around with the epic is very convient, but not vital.  It is not like trying to take an insanely MR mob without any tanks.<P>Don't get me wrong I would love to have the epic, but I don't want to spend the time or deal with the frustration.  I already went through enough with the Aegis of Life, and I had nothing better to do at the time.<P>I think Verrant really screwed up on this quest.  It's true that the elevated demand creates a bigger problem at the bottlenecks. But that is the same as saying, the reason traffic is so bad is because there are to many cars.  I understand Verrant wants to control the influx of epic items into the game, but causing a backlog is not the way to do it.  The rest of the quest should take more time, and be of a greater difficulty to accomplish.  Did they really think there would not be a high demand for this epic?  It directly benefits large numbers of people at once.  Many of the epics do not directly benefit anyone but the owner.  Of course all the epics do have a benefit to everyone fighting with the owner in some way, but it is not a direct or obvious benefit.  I am not at all happy with the way this quest is designed, so I choose not to do it unless I have absolutely nothing better, and a really bad case of insomnia.  If I was a mage, I doubt I would do that quest either because of the pegasus cloak malarkey.  Either way, this is running long, I'm sure it's getting incoherent, so I'm going to go to bed.<P>Once again though.. thanks Rayne, someone had to step up to flamethrower.<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>48th lvl cleric of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife<BR>Troubles Band</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I missed a point somewhere - what does this achieve?  What does this improve & for whom?  I don't see at all how switching to this method makes it fair for all.  Why is the current system (on our server at least) where it's camped by a single cleric until they're done not fair for all?  Why is waiting ones term so much worse than storming over a lone cleric with a raid capable group.  So it saves what, an hour when he spawns?  Err..<P>What this would certainly do is up the bad blood already felt over this spawn.<P>I don't accept the stance "that this is the way Verant built it, so this is the way we shall play".  It's up to us how we handle this, and this sounds dangerously like might makes right.  This would be a serious kick in the groin to the casual player and the small guilds.  However much my friends would do this for me, i would not dream of burdening upto a 72 hour camp on 3 groups of them.  This does not mean i dont have the power to kill him, i could lay my hands on that in 15min, as im sure many people could.<P>If this bottleneck can be managed peacefully without subjecting a tonne of other ppl to the inhumane nature of the camp, then it should be.  Why drag everyone else down into the **** with us?<P>And as Absor says quite clearly - it's clerics who are falling out and causing the gripe over the spawn.  Might be a function of the quest, but it's us who choose to kick & scream with other clerics rather than STFU and behave in a dignified manner when we discover someone else at the camp.<P>Again, i dont see the point of switching to a raid capable group camp.  What does it achieve that a little respect for a lone camper does not?<P>Noa.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The whole process seems fairly dog eat dog and might makes right.  Though in the terms of "camping" you 99.9% of the time must have a group capable of handling the camp to claim it.  <P>What about clerics banding together though?

</FONT><HR>Welcome to the "Lord of the Flies" aka EverQuest.  Justice is in the hands of the stronger.<P>EQ today.  At higher levels where everyone is competing for rare spawns (like ragefire), EQ has degenerated into humanity at it lowest levels.  A rare spawn appears and it dies within minutes, often accompanied by angry accusations that you stole this from my guild/group.  The high level content and rare spawns is a classic example of EQ at it's uggliest.  <P>Now otherwise good people are turning EQ into something akin to road rage.  Put them into the EQ world and things they would normally never consider doing suddenly  become perfectly rational behavior.<P>I used to spend a large portion of my time helping others.  I would travel across multiple zones to rez someone because I got some sad story.  When newbies asked for buffs, I would gladly accomodate.  I was happy to take the time to show people where things were when asked.   LOL, I even used to wander around newbie areas and cast Resolution on complete strangers just for the joy it gave them. <P>Alas, this "Lord of the Flies" attitude is beginning to affect me also.  Nowdays, I won't travel anywhere to help anyone but a good friend or a guildmate.  I have changed my tag to /roleplay so strangers can't easily locate me.  I ignore the newbies asking for buffs.  I rarely even play my cleric anymore as I am so disgusted with the high end EQ game.  <P>All of us pay the same amount to play EQ.  As such, we should all have an equal right to enjoy the game whether we are with a small group of friends or a large guild.  We shouldn't have to pack up and leave an area because a larger, better organized guild has announced that they are taking over the spawn and are better equiped to kill it than we are.  Stop and think of how our world would be if this was common practice.  If someone stronger than you wants your house/car/freedom/etc. they can just come and take it away?  What you say?  This is only a game so this logic doesn't apply?  Think again my friend.  Ask yourself "What would you do if you could do anything you wanted to and no one could prevent you from doing it or even know who you really were?"  Are you sure we aren't seeing this actually happen in Everquest?<P>Welcome to EverQuest.  Your in our world now.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

But when the moment of truth comes and some Cleric is not responding to you as his level 60 guildmates keep pouring into Nagafen's lair, well, think about it.<P>If you're on a server where a list is kept, or any other kind of universally accepted sharing arrangement that's wonderful.  But keep in mind that "lists" are the savior of the week, not the strong.  It's civilized and certainly takes a lot of pressure off people, but when Cleric #87 decides this bites and just takes a spawn, where's your list then?<P>People complain that they cannot compete with the uber-guilds.  Bzzz.  Wrong.  You can.  Ragefire is easy and doesn't take a huge crew to do him.  I told you how to compete.  Be there, ready, and prepared for the duration of your camp.  Yes, you might not see him for a night, or many nights.  That's the Ragefire camp.  But if you are ready when he does spawn and you were there first with your force uber-guild FU can kiss your butt.  That's how you compete.  <P>Uber-guilds are much more organized than casual guilds.  They're moving with complete knowledge of what to do while some smaller guilds are still figuring out what buffs to throw.  That's why they win.  Superior levels and equipment help, but they acquired those levels and equipment through knowledge.  So I've told you how to compete (that be ready thing).  Now stop making excuses and either compete or concede.<P>And that <b>is</b> fair.<P>Rayne<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

My suggestion is hardly a requirement, but if a Cleric ignores it and then loses the spawn he sat at for 24 hours straight to another Cleric from a guild who was able to move faster don't accuses them of stealing the spawn.  He never owned the spawn.  The first to engage (in this case turns in the pearl) owns the spawn.<P>Furthermore, Ragefire is not an entitlement.  I wish things were different, but they are not.  If you don't want to get into the high level dog eat dog world of rare spawns don't.  Just avoid Ragefire, Lodizal, Stormfeather, and the other uber-rare uber-desired spawns and life is more pleasant.  There's plenty of content that is quite doable without getting into spawn competitions.<P>And that's why I don't agree with you Alle.  It's only a nasty competitive environment if you want to participate in it.  You can very easily avoid it and still do many fun things in this game.  But camps like Lodizal aren't going to change, and once people start considering Ragefire more like a Lodizal camp than a Frenzied Ghoul camp we'll be a lot better off.<P>Rayne<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I noticed the Luclin servers ragefire list only has 33 people on it. The list works on that server, in part, due to how short it is. I am positive that Cazic Thule has over 100 clerics to the Ragefire stage, possibly over 150. My guild alone is responsible for putting king notes in the hands of 15-20 clerics and there have been tons of Ixiblat Fer parties with multiple spawnings. Throw in the fact that those of us in powerfull guilds will never ever support a callender system on our server again, a list would never fly on our server, heh. =/<P>Cazic Thule will never have a callender or list for anything again. We had one in the past, mainly due to support from my guild. It died because of greed by smaller guild people who insisted on equal time as the larger guilds, but then piggybacked with eachother to get even more time/spawns. Never again....<BR>The only rotations on CT are agreements between the guilds capable of compeating with eachother, Trakanon and VS are a more formal agreement with open spawns left for anyone that wants to try them. Ragefire will always be a race.<P>------------------<BR>Caleal P`Terak<BR>BATTLE CLERIC of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>Officer, Shadowed Soul</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Recently I saw a post on a EQ site quoting some very wrong or misguided statements from Alan.  I would like to correct a few and ask for a nother look by the dev team.  First a bit about me.  I have a 56 cleric, I have nothing but Rage left to do for over 5 months.  I have spent a total of 436 hours camping Ragefire.  Twice to help others, and twice he was stolen after he spawned and another guild beat mine to the room.<BR>"The only competition over Ragefire is by clerics. The issues that we were addressing were where two, three or more classes wanted to kill an epic NPC. The problem here is completely different. "<P>This is incorrect.  The last time I cleared FG there was a necro and a monk FD in the room AFK.  They were not even responding to camp checks and we had to spend about 2 hours clearing FG to find out it was camped by another class from uber guilds with a few extra computers.  Of course I know what you mean, you mean that no one else woudl kill Rage but a cleric not what I just mentioned, that is also not really accurate.  First, you must kill Nag to get Rage.  A dragon to get a dragon.  On our server Nag is not a priority.  Other classes will kill Rage to get their twink the heart.  The fact is that because you dont' have bottle necks early in the quest, this one is over camped.  Also, because of the other dragon loot he has, many uber guilds DO in fact kill him just for the cloak and armor.  So either way you are wrong.<P>"The Ragefire portion of this quest is not much different than other bottlenecks in other epic quests."<BR>Wrong.  It is different.  What other bottleneck only spawns after you kill another dragon?  What other bottle neck is 72 hours per spawn?  What other bottleneck requires you to kill 12 fire giants to just see if the spawn is up?  What other bottleneck has monks and necros FD at the spot claiming it?  What other bottleneck drops armor and other items like Rage?  What other bottleneck doesn't have prior bottlenecks sufficient to keep the flow controlled up to it, and not a floodgate that ends with one spawn?  What other bottleneck can a FDer camp without risk?  What other bottleneck is a race by guilds?  <BR>None.  Sure many bottlenecks share some of these attributes, but I submit that no others share them all.  Also, because of the server downtime, it is even worse.  Three times now YOU took the servers down without notice after I spent 48 hours on the camp.  What other bottle neck requires this kind of time, that is then ruined regularly by server downs?  And finally, Solb is without a doubt the buggiest zone in the game, no other epic bottleneck exists in a zone this buggy, from vid cards freezing or slowing, to corpse warping, to getting warped to the GM room.<P>"I have read all of the comments made about this issue. While I can see that this is a concern, the solution is that people need to get along. We can't control the fact that so many people feel that they need to get this item and are willing to screw with other people to get it. The two solutions to that are to just give one to every cleric over 50th level, or to remove (or nerf) the item. "<P>Wrong.  You have NOT read 'all the comments'.  That is unreasonable.  I suppose you may have read some or maybe most.  But from your lack of understanding, and the fact that every person I know has an opposing view, I doubt you read all of them.  The solution is that people need to get along, this statement is wrong.  That is not a viable solution at all, you can't only suggest people get along.  Even Verant has play nice policys, what you suggest here is get along, but we aren't gonna make you get along with reasonable guidelines.  You CAN control the fact that people are screwing people to get the item, you just don't want to.  The 2 solutions you offer are not viable solutions and you know it.  You then proceed to make non-excuses for not implementing viable ones later in the post.<P>"1. No. Nagafen isn't going to just kill himself. He is one of THE epic encounters for those that haven't purchased expansions, and he's not going to just off himself so a cleric can have an epic weapon. "<BR>OK good don't let a dragon kill itself.  How about NOT weaving together 2 epic encounters in the same exact spot, where one can not even be killed by the same people that go after the other?  I can't even fight Nag at 56, yet I have to see him killed before I can kill the second epic encounter in the same exact spot.  And if Nag doesn't kill himself for Rage then why does Rage kill himself for Nag?  How is it different?  I should get screwed because some newbie twink needs CoF?  How is it different?<P>"It IS a timed spawn Very similar to what you suggest."  No, it is not on a regular timer like many others, and it doesn't starting counting till a dragon dies (one that a 53 plus can't fight) and it isn't on 24 hour, or even a predicatble 72, and it doesn't start when servers come up like all other spawns.<P>"3. He is also triggered, just as you suggest. "  That just isn't fair, you know the trigger is what we are talking about, not the actual spawn.  The trigger is the problem.  You could make it double triggered.  I give him a pearl, he gives me another item, then Rage only spawns when he gets that item back.  If servers go out then that item will spawn him at anytime.  This would ensure the cleric really can own the spawn if the cleric really camps it.  If the servers poof or some other weird thing happens, then the only competition will be between one or 2 clerics not 50.<P>"4. This might be something that we could do. But you're slightly wrong, he is intimately linked with Nagafen, and moving him and changing this quest would require a rewrite, and might completely invalidate the existing quest."  Wrong.  Come on man we are not stupid.  You completely invalidatet he druid and ranger quest?  Or the warrior now that the dagger drop is less rare, is it totally invalid?  Did you break the game?  Of course not.  To say a change at this stage would be this strong is false and obviously false.  It might be a little work, but hey its an epic quest, it deserves to be done well and right.  You redid several epic quests in the past.<P>"1. Well, the fact that it could be considered the best available is, primarily, the cause of all of this conflict. You mentioned earlier (in part of your comment that I cut out), that you thought there might be 20-25 clerics waiting for this part of their epic on your server. There probably aren't that many of any other class working on their epic at all, in any stage, on your server. This indicates to me that the problem lies in the perceived value of the item, not in the quest itself. "  I don't consider it the best available myself.  I would rate the mage way above it, and several others.  The cleric item like all cleric power, is in the fact that is useful to a group not to the cleric individual.  That is also the source of much of the problem.  You miss one problem here, there are not enough bottle necks earlier in the quest.  The king should be on a 12 hour timer.  Or you should alter the trigger as I mentioned.  The reason the perceived value is high, is that it benefits others not the cleric.  If a mage get an epic the mage is uber not the warrior or a monk, this is not true for the cleric epic, if I get it, I benefit every other class, even if I don't benefit myself greatly.  The same is true somewhat with the enchanter epic.  <P>"But I think I agree that the final battle isn't nearly hard enough. However, increasing the power of this final NPC would not solve the issue at hand. "  Not fair at all.  No other epic fight is any harder, to threaten us with you got it too wasy now retoric is unfair.  What was offered was a trade off, make ours so much harder than the rest, but increase the spawn, its a tradeoff that should indicate how much the change is desired, instead you make it sound like you need to make it harder.  Not nice.<P>"2. Nagafen doesn't live long on many servers. But I can see the inconsistency in this issue, if nothing else. However, many clerics overcome this problem by offering to aid people to destroy Nagafen, and in a way this promotes the kind of thing we like to see in game. "  OK really confused, you want to see a 56 help to kill something that you changed the code on so he can't help to kill the thing he is helping to kill??  That is what Verant wants to encourage?  Sure I can buff and res people (I do this), but you really should not entwine 2 epic encounters that are otherwise totally unrelated.<P>"First, we can't be changing epic quests all the time to make them fit the current game. Just like any other content, these quests will get easier as time passes and players get higher level, better items and all that. "  You already have done changes to other epics, you have even supposedly fixxed bugs and things on Rage specifically.  We are not asking you change them all the time, just again.  Same as war, druid, ranger, necro, mage, etc.  How many times have I seen you come the the boards and say the opposite of this statement?  That you must change the game as the game changes?  A hundred? Two?  Isn't part of the vision that the game does change?<P>"The only solution to that would be to nerf the item, make it less desirable so that fewer people will be insisting that Clerics have this item. We've decided not to do that. "  That is not true.  You can solve the problem by adding a double trigger that would at least ensure a cleric only camps the item.  You can increase the spawn rate, you can undbind the rate with the nag spawn, you can allow both to live at the same time, or at least make Rage not die if Nag does, you can add a different trigger, you can make the FG kill those FDer campers, you can remove the dragon loot and make him like Faydedar and triggered, you can add an alternate method of completion, you can do a million other things besides nerf or remove.  That is not the only solution to any problem, you know that.<P>I was very bothered by your post overall.  It was untrue in several parts and showed a lack of effort.  I am not sure what else to say.  I have spent 5 months trying to get this item, I am in a guild capable of getting the item, but because of poor design and lack of thought, I would probably sell my account and quit tomorrow if it was legal.  I find the high end game for my class to be pitiful.  I find the desire to begin another class undesireable, because of the problems with the high end game on this one.  Oh well you have several thousand others so whats a few hundred unhappy players that alphaed, betaed, guided and bought your game?  Right?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>First off I belong to a smaller type guild on Prexus server.  I have my epic, as I was around level 56 when the quest was first put out, and I did not have a long zordak camp, as by a stroke of luck he spawned while my guild had three groups clearing out fire giants, the day after Nagy had been killed.<BR>I was lucky, and know it.  <BR>The Zordak camp is now getting backed up and slowed down on our server, and from what I read the list rotation thing on Luclin sounds like a good idea to me, as long as it is followed.  <BR>I don't particularly disagree with Rayne on his idea of what defines camping, but I also am sympathetic to a cleric who has sat in Zordaks lair for 3 days straight waiting for him to pop, and five minutes isn't alot of time to gather forces, whether friends, guildmates or what have you, to get there and kill him.. In most cases the casual player or non uber guild player would have trouble getting the forces their necessary in that short of a time. I whole heartedly agree that the effect on the epic shouldn't proc until a cleric is of that same spell level(56). This would at least maybe slow down the bottleneck at Zordak, and give the senior clerics a bit more consideration at the camp.  <BR>I have tried to approach the epic like most camps, and realized that for me to get help on a short notice, that I would in turn have to help other classes on short notice.  I helped several different clases with their epic that were non guildmates, and somewhat strangers, and many of those helped me with Zordak when he popped for me.. That is probably the casual players best hope of success, if there is no rotation or list in place.., is to call in those chips so to speak.  Good luck to you.<BR>One final word, and hate to pick one person out.. but Galavant the epic is really a great item, and even though I could cast the spell by the time I received mine, there is such an advantage on raids due to the manaless rez.. One epic equiped cleric can rez an entire raid of five or six groups in such a short time, have mana for heals and buffs, that it makes the success of many raids much more likely.. and of shorter duration.  <BR>Dusklar Level 60 High Priest of Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Phill<P>While I would tend to agree with some of what you said - I think the point Rayne is trying to make is this.<P>The one solo cleric sitting in Naggy's lair can not in any way form or shape possibly even hope to kill Ragefire solo.<P>Therefore he can not really lay claim to the spawn.  A cleric solo can kill the spectre sitting at the tree in ferrott, therefore he/she CAN claim that spawn as camped.<P>Yes it sucks that people aren't willing to be nice and let the person that has been sitting there for an ungodly amount of time have first dibs on the spawn.<P>But the nature of the game is - he/she who has the first capable force of killing said spawn, is the one that will win the item.<P>Curteousy left this game long time ago - shortly followed by honor and caringness.<P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>59th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>My thought is, Ragefire is such a long, annoying camp that he shouldn't be camped in the traditional sense.  You get your buddies and go clear fire giants, check to see if he is up.  If he is, great.  Kill him.  Maybe wait around few hours and see.  But don't even go down there if you don't have the forces online to take him. Meanwhile everyone you know gets cool firegiant loot.  First person ready to trigger him, gets him. <P>Seems reasonably fair.  No one has invested huge numbers of hours in mindless boredom.  No one is camping therefore no camp to steal. <P>I did the camp once for 32 hours and I swore I wouldn't do it again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Dalur, I understand Rayne's point completely.  I am just saying that courtesy is gone only when we let it be gone.  I devote 50 some hours to keeping the giants cleared, watching a spot on a wall and searching for a spawn ragefire button, I believe that should give me or whoever the cleric there first dibs.<P>As I said, people treated me with courtesy throughout my camp.  I will do the same for others.  I hope everyone else does as well.<p>[This message has been edited by PhillGreen (edited 05-09-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Why does "courtesy" require that you get this Zordak spawn, as opposed to another cleric who probably wants the epic just as badly?

</FONT><HR>Rayne,<P>For once I disagree with you. I feel that if a cleric is sitting in the durn lair and has had his guild clearing FGs as they spawn, he has the camp. <P>Now, does he have 4 hours to get forces together - heck no. But 20 minutes or 30 minutes, sure.<P>I finally got my epic this weekend (yeah!). I am more drained than excited. The first time I had the camp, the zone was reset after close to 10 hours. The second time the vendor was killed. This time I got there, cleared the FGs and parked my butt there. I had between 2-24 people with me there the entire time (thank god there is a European guild in our alliance, helped a lot around the 4 a.m. ET time slot). Within 10 minutes of him spawning I had 40+ people in the zone. (It was our first cleric epic in the alliance I am in and everyone wanted to be there, we COULD have gone within 5 minutes, but others were inc).<P>We had someone from another alliance pop in but they courteously backed off when they saw we were assembling.<P>If you see someone with the forces converging and you know they have been there a while - I think you should back off the camp. It is the respectful thing to do. The mad rush which I think you would propose leads to hard feelings.<P>Now, I do Not think sitting at the zone and calling 'Ragefire camped' is the way to go. In fact, a cleric was doing that and backed off when I pointed out I had the forces killing FGs, and he had no one in the zone with him. I let that cleric know when I killed Ragefire and he moved his forces in.<P>Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst<BR>the Haven<BR>AoVB<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>On the Brell server the list of clerics needing Ragefire is not as long as many of the other servers. So the competition of getting him has not reached to the levels that some of you may be seeing.<P>On Brell it is generally accepted that if someone is camping (ala solo fd monk or a small group with cleric) him they can have his spawn. We haven't had any cases of 2 clerics and multiple guilds camping him at the same time.<P>Part of this may also be because on Brell the FG's are a reserved raid spawn and can not easily be trampled on. In one case a larger guild did come down to a lone cleric that was at the ragefire spawn and they did a roll off for which cleric was able to take him and regardless of the results the larger guild would help take Ragefire down for the winning Cleric.<P>I would hate to see the day on Brell where it becomes he who can amase their force and strike first gets it. That being said you also do not give an unlimited time for the person to get a force together. On the whole anyone getting an Epic on brell is viewed more of a good thing for the server and not just their guild.<P>Nasren Gnommeysnak<BR>54 Gnome Vicar<BR>Watchers - Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>i can't help remembering how many months back when this item was first found and there was an uproar at "how bad it was" and "how much it marginalized the cleric class" because it was designed by someone that "didn't understand a cleric's role."  now it's one of the most coveted items in the game.  i'm afraid i'd have to agree with Absor that when an item is that in demand, any hurdle they can put up besides just sheer time probably won't prevent them from flowing into the game quickly.  then again things like Sarnek Earrings of Station seem to remain scarce, but i'm not sure that is what we'd want the quest modeled after.<P>if you think the spawn time for Zordak is long, it seems to pale in comparison to the duration of the animosities that seem to be forming.<P>-Ork</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Hey Skrim,<P>Congrats on your Epic =).<P>Again, my goal in my front page post was to hopefully inject some reality into this spawn and hopefully avoid some hurt feelings for Clerics.  You know, the posts by Cleric01 who complains that "their Ragefire" was stolen.<P>The most consistent ruling on this issue by Verant seems to be that the person who turns in the pearl gets the spawn.  Killing the FGs is beyond trivial, the spawn is not tied to them, and is really pretty irrelevant to Ragefire, other than being in the way.  Furthermore, by attempting to tie the clearing of FGs to the Ragefire spawn you're (well, many others feel this way also) trying to create ownership that is just not enforceable.  Verant has repeatedly shown in the past that they do not care who has cleared the FGs.  They do care who turns in the pearl first as that is basically "engagement" for this particular spawn.<P>So by suggesting that the only valid method of camping is to have the forces on hand at that time I have attempted to eliminated numerous problems over the spawn.  So what if uber-guild We Roxx0r U is mobilizing?  You're already fighting.  So what if there was a FD Monk?  You're ready immediately.  Any other method of handling it becomes a negotiation where there really isn't much available to negotiate over.  One just basically has to hope that the latecomer is feeling generous.<P>Some people have called my post a "might makes right" scenario.  Nah, that's not it.  Instead, I prefer to call it a "might makes it safe" scenario.  If I have the might there, I am safe from all would be kill stealers (yes, I'm ignoring two or more strong groups sitting there, do a /random or something).  I won't have to depend upon the kindness of other people who want the item as badly as myself.  In game terms they are certainly just as deserving.<P>Furthermore, I'm not suggesting that there be a mad rush to mobilize for Ragefire when he spawns.  I'm suggesting being totally ready to avoid the mad rush.  Yes, I certainly understand that having a group of people sitting there is boring for all.  Ok, so don't have them sit there.  Just don't piss and moan that someone else came and "stole your mob."  It wasn't your mob because you didn't engage.<P>You suggest that 5 minutes is too short, 4 hours too long, and 20-30 minutes is "just right."  I guarantee you that if 30 minutes becomes the rule, some Clerics will go for 40 when the moment of truth arrives. Others will get screwed because someone else decided 15 minutes was plenty and they were ready now.  It's not enforceable at all, so why even bring it into the equation?<P>Are you familiar with the Lodizal spawn?  He's on a roughly 24 hour timer (it's variable, not sure how variable).  He drops the shells necessary for the shield and also a map part for one of the best face pieces in the game.  The "rule" on him is first engaged owns the spawn until one or the other is dead.  People sit out there looking for him, but if they don't engage quickly (within seconds) are they entitled to the spawn?  Of course not, he who engages first gets it.  How is this spawn different?  Because it's for the Cleric epic and not the Eyepatch of Plunder or the Lodizal Shell Shield?  Bah, I just don't buy that.<P>Skrim, I'm pretty damned familiar with how things worked on Karana.  I'm also familiar with how it works on A-Ro, a definite FFA server.  Any arrangements that can be worked out on a server wide basis are great.  I'd far prefer some kind of rotation or list for dealing with these mobs.  It makes life a lot smoother.  But lists are mostly to the benefit of the little guy, not the big guy.  And since they aren't enforceable, I don't see a lot of point in suggesting them.  As I see reality it's first there with the force, so I strongly suggest people have the force.  Because if they did, there would be a lot less strife over this spawn.<P>Rayne<P>PS.  I wanted to add that everyone is naturally free to handle this situation however they see fit.  My opinions mean nothing.  I do think I am correct though in stating what the baseline for this camp is.  Anything less becomes a gamble.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Rayne (edited 05-09-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>If you dont agree with rayne, you dont deserve the epic, this is directly to you, all of you level 52- clerics. you dont deserve it, I dont care how much you think you do, you dont, atleast not more than half the 56+ clerics that you steal from...<BR>Yes, I called you theives, you are...<P>I am level 58 currently, and bowed out to a 59 cleric...  One level? Yes, it means a lot.. Our guild had a few epics, his had none...  he deserves/needs it more... Just because he's higher level? No, but because he has aquired the same peices as I have, and has put some more time into xp groups, and he's more powerful on a raid than I am (niglecting skill differences).  Am I rutheless? Yes, am I right? Yes.  If you dont think so, you either 1) have the weapon or 2) One of those lower level clerics that think since you are level 52, and never raid, never use this weapon to its full capacity, never had to wait 45 minutes to gain enough mana to rez 100 dead people in Temple Of Veeshan, or Veeshans Peak, or hell, even some planes....  Yes, you are the undeserving schmuks that hide behind your claim to fairness because you pay the $10 too....<P>-Eanne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006222&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006222&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
