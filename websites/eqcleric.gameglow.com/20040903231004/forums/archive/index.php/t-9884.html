<br />
So far since 34, I've had 9 powerlevel requests, and 9 people on ignore.<br />
<br />
I generally don't have a problem helping a young Cleric in Nektulos or something getting from 4 to 5 to get their new spells, but powerleveling a level 33 Warrior?  PLEEEEEEEEEASE!  Save me!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sonard</div><div class="date">08-23-2000, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I know what you mean, it seems I can't run through EC these days without as least one &quot;Dood, can you powerlevel me?&quot;.  I have found a great way of shutting them up though, just say 200pp/level.  I have yet to have anyone come up with the money.  On a side note, I do powerlevel people who I know will appreciate it and don't beg.  I was in befallen the other night camping the paw because I was bored and tired of waiting for a group in SolB. While there there was a newbie monk (lvl 7) who was TRYING to kill skells by the zone but kept getting trained every few minutes.  I was keeping her buffed and healed when I could so that she wouldn't die from someone elses rudeness (not once was a train to zone called).  So when a Drood came in and asked how much longer I would be camping the paw, I said he could have and and spent an hour powerleveling the monk. I would run in and pull 3 or 4 mummies and let her take them one at a time.  Why did I do this? Because others were getting her killed, and it was fun to see someone awed at my abilities (I know, powertrip, but its nice to go on one once and a while) and 2, she was either a genuine newbie or a great actor (she said and I quote, &quot;Wow, I got great exp off that shriveled thingy!).  And another thing, I kept asking her if she wanted me to pull some stuff and she kept saying, no, its ok, if you have other things to do I'll be fine&quot;.  She realised that I could be doing other things and that showed she appreciated my time.  So powerleveling can be rewarding in the right circumstances, but I hate nothing more than strangers begging me for stuff that I never got at thier levels. (Why is it that every twink out there thinks that if you are above level 30 you have unlimited plat and all the free time in the world?).  While I never am anon, the idea gets more and more appealing every day (and I still haven't gotten high enough to exp rez)<br />
Anyway, thats my 2cp, thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naelana</div><div class="date">08-23-2000, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently had a period of power leveling requests OFF MY OWN GUILD MEMBERS. Reason for this was cos I helped a very close friend, level a new primary character to 50. However I offered to do that leveling cos he is a close friend and cos he was unhappy with his primary character. I made it very clear to my guild that if I want to help someone level I will offer to do it, and that they can quit asking me. Anyhow I want to get 60 first before I even think about PLing a guilies twink.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I know exactly what you mean, Sonard.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  There was a little monk lady out in Ill Omen where I was PLing my husband.  Not once did she ask for help or buffs or anything.  So, just to spite her, I buffed the living bejesus out of her (Naltron, shield, etc.).<br />
<br />
Then last night, about 5 days after I'd been out there, went out to bring the husband some bandaids, and she sent me a tell thanking me for the buffs the other night.  I told her to swing by and buffed her again.<br />
<br />
How difficult is it to be polite, appreciative of others' time, and courteous?  Because I will *always* buff the newbie who has those qualities, while I ignore the obnoxious strangers who want my time and aren't even willing to thank me.<br />
<br />
Aenae: we're actually pretty good at PLing, although I think the kings are druids (damage shield, sow, etc.), especially for lower levels where people's weapon skills aren't that great.<br />
<br />
I believe the perfect combo would be an enchanter and a cleric, especially for pure casting classes.<br />
<br />
Basically with my husband I just buff him up (courage line, armor line, symbol).  He pulls, I help park whatever additional stuff he pulls, and then throw a remedy his way when he needs it.  When someone asks him to group, I just rinse and repeat with the new addition.<br />
<br />
With two people, it helps a lot to use the /assist command on the critter they're fighting, that way you can remain sitting and still keep the other group members targeted for heals.</div></div><hr />
