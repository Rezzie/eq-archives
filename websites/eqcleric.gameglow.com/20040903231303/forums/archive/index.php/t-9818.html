You get on in FP zone into OOT wait a bit Zone again and guess what...your back in FP!!!  Same thing on the Butcher side also.  And if your going to OOT well you have to swim for it the boats didn't stop at sister island.  Atleast this is how the boats were running on Povar don't know about the other servers.  I hope they fixed it in todays patch because it was very frustrating.  And getting a port was even more frustrating since everyone was asking all the druids and wizards disapeared.  Can't Verant fix anything without breaking something else grrrrrrr.<br />

Not sure why they are like this, but it didnt use to be this way and the boats have done this for a month on innoruuk.<br />
