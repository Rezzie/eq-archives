But I'm sorry.  I just seem to be hitting their last few patches all wrong. Friday, the day I take off from work, they do a 6 hour patch during &quot;working hours.&quot;  Today, woke up early and thought I'd play from 5:30 to 6:30 AM central time.  Of course, I can't since they started the patch at 5:00 AM central time (3:00 AM pacific).  Great -- for those of you who are home today, have fun!  I'm GLAD they are patching early... hopefully by the time I get home from work all you kids will already be off the boats  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
But posting the &quot;scheduled downtime&quot; at 12 midnight, pacific time (2:00 AM central) is pure, unadulterated BS.  THREE HOURS NOTICE is NOT SCHEDULED.  I understand that this is Kunark...  but they pulled the same stunt last Friday  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
I wish I could do this at work -- give 3 hours notice for &quot;scheduled meetings,&quot; &quot;scheduled deadlines,&quot; &quot;scheduled days off...&quot;<br />
<br />
They're starting to remind me of the joke about being flexible... where the manager tells the employee that the employee needs to be more flexible, like the manager is.  The employee looks at the manager, and says, &quot;Flexible?  That explains how your head got where it is...&quot;<br />
