Hello all,<br />
<br />
Every Monday here at Verant we hold our weekly meetings to go over the current outstanding projects and make<br />
plans for the week going forward. At this week's meeting, we discussed a number of issues that I'd like to bring to<br />
your attention and open for debate. <br />
<br />
Skin Like Nature:<br />
<br />
Last week a change to the Skin Like Nature spell was implemented. The change replaced the &quot;HP Regen&quot; component<br />
of the spell with a &quot;Damage Shield&quot; component. <br />
<br />
We also introduced a bug that caused the damage shield to stack improperly. The Damage Shield values are being<br />
subtracted instead of being added. The Damage shield bug will be fixed in the next patch for all stackable damage<br />
shields that had this problem (there were a few). However, we'd like to open the damage shield's replacement of the<br />
regen component for debate.<br />
<br />
The regen component on this spell was replaced with the Shield because it allowed the Enchanter-Gasping and<br />
Necro-Heart series to overwrite SLN. Unfortunately, directly fixing this issue is not possible, as it would require a<br />
rewrite of the spell-interaction/stacking code. This would undoubtedly introduce other problems that we don't want<br />
to risk at this stage. By replacing the regen component with the damage shield, SLN is no longer overwritten by those<br />
other spells.<br />
<br />
As it seems that many people were upset by the change, and since the change was not made for balance reasons,<br />
we’d like to get general consensus on what should be done with the spell. The options available are 1) Leave it as it<br />
is now (Damage Shield), or 2) Return it to the way it was (HP Regen).<br />
<br />
The Mistwalker:<br />
<br />
We are currently reevaluating the decision to reduce the proc percentage for this weapon. We’re looking at the<br />
number of Mistwalker’s on each server, and the possible effect should we return it to the way it was. We are also<br />
looking at other ways to avoid the exploit that was possible before, that would allow us to return the weapon to the<br />
way it was. Much thanks to everyone who sent in suggestions that would make this possible. I can’t comment further<br />
on it at this time, but I just wanted to let those concerned know that the issue was still open.<br />
<br />
Tallon Zek &amp; PvP Looting:<br />
<br />
There is unfortunately no reasonable way for us to eliminate the equipment dependence disparity between melee and<br />
caster classes. This equipment dependence disparity creates a loot disparity on the two servers. Casters can “bag”<br />
all of their equipment and still be 90% effective in PvP combat. Melee, on the other hand, cannot. During the next<br />
patch, tentatively scheduled for 2/16/00, we will be changing the looting rules for the Tallon Zek server from “Coin +<br />
1 item” to “Coin Only”. This change is being made as a Test to determine what looting rules are actually preferred by<br />
the majority of people who play on PvP. We’ll be examining server load over the next few weeks to determine the<br />
changes impact on population. Vallon Zek (the other PvP Teams Server) will remain “Coin + 1 item”. <br />
<br />
We expect that this change will lead to a new influx of people playing melee characters on Tallon Zek. Please keep in<br />
mind that in the event that the change shows itself to be detrimental to server population or morale, the server may<br />
be changed back to “Coin + 1 item” loot.<br />
<br />
Alchemy and Poison:<br />
<br />
Alchemy and Poison are in the process of being revamped on the Test server. Changes are scheduled to go live on<br />
2/16/00, but don’t quote me on that just yet <br />
<br />
Rogue Enhancements:<br />
<br />
Some interesting rogue enhancements are being developed on the Test server with plans of going live on 2/16/00. <br />
<br />
The chance of scoring a critical hit with a throwing weapon is being increased dramatically. In addition, a thrown<br />
weapon that hits the target from behind will have a chance of scoring a “Deadly Strike”. Additional throwing weapons<br />
will be released at a later date to make throwing even more viable.<br />
<br />
In addition to the throwing changes, a new ability (much more exciting than throwing) is being granted to the rogue<br />
class. The ability, called “Evade”, is tied to the “Hide” skill. It is used by targeting a creature and pressing the “Hide”<br />
button. If it is successful, it will dramatically reduce how much the targeted creature hates the rogue. The Rogue will<br />
be given a message indicating success or failure. <br />
<br />
This new ability is, for all intents and purposes, a reverse taunt, and will help the grouped rogue shift the targeted<br />
creatures focus back to the tank after landing all of those hits. This is not like feign death, which makes the creature<br />
forget you entirely, but rather just makes it hate you less. In addition, it only works against the targeted creature. <br />
<br />
The skill is partially implemented on the Test server. Currently, getting hit by a creature makes the rogue’s “Hide”<br />
button gray out. Once this is changed so that it doesn’t gray out upon getting hit, it will work as intended. <br />
<br />
NPC Warping:<br />
<br />
We are dedicating a good number of man hours this week to tracking down and eliminating the bug that causes a<br />
fleeing creature to teleport away. <br />

I've completely lost any respect for Verant, they are no better than OSI in my book, and I quit UO after only 5 months....dunno how long I can hang on to EQ........<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">02-08-2000, 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My patience is ending too. Camping all the time is getting really boring, and the number of quests available is very low. We have a plateful of issues that need to be addressed on an immediate basis and they spend half their time on druids and rangers, again! I'm not feeling sorry for rogues anymore either, they've had plenty of improvements and they just keep getting more.<br />
<br />
Now they are also further screwing up PvP (hope this experiment fails). The problem with melee vs. caster in PvP is entirely caused by the bind problem. Yes/No box on binding for melee types and allow them to be bound anywhere is the solution. Of course, with fear long since nerfed, its not as if clerics can kill anyone near their level in PvP anyway.<br />
<br />
In case you didn't hear, cleric plane armor is now nonexistent... report has it one guild went to Hate for 10 hours and got ZERO armor drops. Fear now drops much more than it did, but of course there is no cleric armor there.<br />
<br />
More extremely unprofessional behavior, incompetence, and thick-skulledness, courtesy of Verant.<br />
<br />
I for one am definitely not buying the expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarLocke</div><div class="date">02-08-2000, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EQ was not designed for PvP.  The PvP servers only exist because players in Beta wanted one.<br />
<br />
The Bind problem is not PvP only; it is a problem with the whole system.  PvP will never be balanced as implemented, simply because casters can be nearly as effective naked as equipped, and melee classes are heavily equipment-dependant.<br />
<br />
The change to Valon is a good one, although I take issue with them only changing one server.  What is to become of melee'ers on Talon?  &quot;Oh, we're sorry, you chose the wrong server, even though they were supposedly the same.&quot;  Puhleeze.<br />
<br />
Rogues are not fixed.  They never will be.  In order to make them proper rogues, whole zones would have to be redone, to add locked doors, traps, and whatnot.  I gave up on my rogue because I was effectively forced into Verant's &quot;melee damage specialist&quot; role.  I plan on buying Neverwinter Nights and playing a TRUE rogue there.<br />
<br />
Oh, you take objection to fear being nerfed?  I guess you didn't mind when someone could fear you and have their level 50 friend blast you into tomorrow, eh?  Another example of Verant taking the easy way out.<br />
<br />
Ethereal Mist...  I can't comment.  I still have 18 levels to go before I can attempt the planes, barring the exp buffer I'll want.  I can tell you this, however:  No matter how rare EM is, I'll be there hunting for it.  It's the same reason I wear my quest vambraces and boots, and will wear the rest of my sol armor--it's MY armor.  It's a status symbol.  I am NOT a druid.  I Am Cleric.<br />
<br />
On Verant...  Agreed.  But every company goes this way eventually.  Do you remember any good Sierra games?  I do, although it's been a long while...<br />
<br />
Expansion...  Yes.  Why?  Because despite all Verant has bungled, EQ is still fun.  I wouldn't play if it wasn't.  Just don't read any messageboards for a couple days, then try it again.  All the whining and bitching really wears away at your gaming spirit.<br />
