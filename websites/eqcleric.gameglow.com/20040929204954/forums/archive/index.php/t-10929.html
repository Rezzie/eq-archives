Was wondering how to control the rampage. When we engaged he promptly dissabled our clerics (he rampaged from whever you are in the zone). After a few tries of doing different things we gave up. How do you control the rampaged and keep the thing on the tank?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baki</div><div class="date">02-19-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding of rampage is limited, I don't think anyone really knows how it works.  But the way we handle it is rampage usally hits the top 4 folks on agro list.  Whether this is proximtiy agro or damage agro really doesn't seem to matter.  We have a pally start with loh, they should than be first on list, pallys have the ability to heal themselves so they are a good target for rampage. After main tank engages two other warriors shoot arrows to place them on list. They also move close in so they get proximity agro.  Clerics stay at max ch range.<br />
<br />
Works most of the time.<br />

Should there be a CH rotation on each person on the rampage list? Thats the only thing I can think of, because of the scale he hits, when one of the rampage victims die, its ussually the cleric next.<br />

After 30 seconds I was the only cleric left as he ate the other 2 - but with RC slowed I was able to keep the MT alive untill I had to move too close to RC to pick up more rods. Quickly after that I died with RC at 25% but the remaining 10-12 people killed him regardless. <br />
<br />
So, slow is the name of the game.<br />

That should be standard on any mob.  Throw malo in there also.  Cripple will lessen the number of times he rampages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">02-24-2002, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild failed also the first 2 times.  His rampage and agro is very excessive and control agro is very hard if you have to heal the damage he puts out.<br />
<br />
The way we got round it, and eventually won was fairly simple.<br />
<br />
Sacrifice a slower.<br />
<br />
Get whoever pulls him, do it in front of a slower.  The resists on it are pretty minimul at best.  Pull to camp, start with a CH chain with a nice delay such as 60, and boom the critter is dead.  The difference between agro control and agro all over the place is simply put amazing.  I immediately saw that we had won from about 15 seconds into the fight.<br />
<br />
He has exceedingly high ac so make sure you have another slower as dispite his low hps, he can take a while to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veenublue</div><div class="date">02-26-2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems to stay off rampage, clerics just stick to healing and not any MoR or MoK until a little later in fight after 4 tanks have agroed him.<br />
<br />
I have heard it is only attacks that place you on Rampage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">02-28-2002, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing definitely place you on the rampage list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Send in MA have SA'a shoot arrows at him till the call to engage is called.<br />
<br />
<br />
His non rampage meele on me (I have very ghetto ac/gear) seemed to be around 500/550dmg mark.<br />
<br />
His rampage meele on me(I have very ghetto ac/gear) was around 700/750dmg mark.<br />
<br />
<br />
But once slowed he was toast even when it was one of the most unorganized raids we have ever done and aggro control was all over the place with myself managing to gain normal meele aggro once during the fight and got rampaged on twice before been killed.<br />
<br />
But we got him even if it seemed upon entering Umbral Planes we left our raiding skills at the entrance of the zone that night *grins*<br />

My enchanter mate jumped at the chance to play 'hero' :&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Binadint</div><div class="date">03-04-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think a rampage can hit you if the mob isn't facing you. Atleast that is the case with the mob in SSRA that rampages every hit. Only the MT stands in front and we get little to no deaths from rampage. If some gets agro that shouldn't have it turn off attack until the MT gets Him turned back.<br />
