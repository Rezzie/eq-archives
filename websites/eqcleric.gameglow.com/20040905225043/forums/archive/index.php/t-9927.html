<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xthor</div><div class="date">06-01-2001, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was sitting in Lfay the other day trying to find Ghasts for the Tunare symbol quest (do those things EVER spawn?!)  I got a tell from a druid that had died at the orc fort in EW.  I'd rezzed him earlier in the day, and he asked if I'd rez him again if he paid me 100pp, tp'd me to Velious, ran me there, and tp'd me back to Steamfont.  Seemed reasonable, so I said yes.<br />
<br />
When we zoned into EW, someone shouted to the zone looking for a rez.  I asked where and he said Orc fort.  I told him I was on my way there. <br />
<br />
When I arrived, I first rez'd the druid that had ported me, and then told the other person I needed to med up.  He asked how much the rez was going to cost and what level it was.  I told him what I always tell people:  whatever you feel is appropriate and 50% rez.  He asked me how much again.  I said, &quot;well, not more than 100pp.&quot;  (I usually get anywhere from 50-150 depending on how much out of my way it is...even though I never ask a set amount.)<br />
<br />
So he asked yet again:  Well, so how much do you want?  I finally said: How 'bout 75pp?<br />
<br />
Long pause...<br />
<br />
&quot;No way.  I've got a 96% rez coming for 20pp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Soooo.   I got my TP back to Steamfont, did one more check for ghasts, and called it a day.  Maybe it's just me, but if somebody tells you that they don't charge a set price, and you continue to bug them until they finally throw out a number, why then complain about it?  Sheesh.  <br />
