<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">03-09-2000, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in lower guk last night with a group that was camping just outside the Assasin / Supplier room.<br />
<br />
There was a level 50 necro there claiming the Assasin, Supplier and the Sage. Note that: 1. You can't do this without leaving the room. 2. Level 50 gets no exp in this spot.<br />
<br />
So, at one point when the necro is off killing the sage, we decide to move into the room. He comes back and some words are exchanged. Supplier pops and we all go at it (he charmed the thing, but we were smart enough to wait till the charm was gone). We get the kill, and he promptly informs the zone that we are all kill stealers.<br />
<br />
I feel that we were in the right, but the whole thing really left a bad taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
This guy farms stuff in lguk nearly every night to sell plat on eBay and often monopolizes multiple spawns.<br />

<br />
Personally, I think Verant should start cracking down on them. Buy some stuff on ebay, meet the sellers in the game to get it, and then axe the account. Should nip that junk in the bud really really fast.</div></div><hr />

Multiple spawn farming is fine if the zone is empty or almost empty, but when a group takes a room, he must yield.</div></div><hr />
