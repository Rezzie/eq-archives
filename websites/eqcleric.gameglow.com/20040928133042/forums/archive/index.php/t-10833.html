<br />
When fighting Yelinak how do you keep your mana going? I do get c2 each time and I have finally givin up on useing MR gear as at my lvl it doesn't seem to help. Instead I load up on Mana gear to make my mana pool larger. Is there any trick to conserve your mana or how high should your MR be to resist the DoT? I think being lvl 54 is playing to much in my ability to not resist the DoT. What are your experiences?<br />
<br />
I have watched 3 raids fail now because all the clerics are OOM and Yelinak is at or under the L.<br />

<br />
Keep a few extra clerics out of his AE range and bring them in as needed? COH them in?<br />
<br />
Or have the extra clerics camp out and log in 1 min into the battle? The 1 min time should vary as you should know how long to wait before logging them in.<br />
<br />
Any way to dispell this mana sucking dot?<br />
Possible use pumice to dispell it?<br />

<br />
You already answered your own question.<br />
<br />
You could reserve yourself to stay out of range until the end of the fight...but for obvious reasons that's sort of reaching.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasren</div><div class="date">05-07-2001, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The overwriting is easy, it overwrites c2 and c2 overwrites the dot. Just reapply c2.<br />
So far we have assigned 5 clerics per enchanter. and have set locations that you set up in so that the chanter is farly close to you for c2.<br />
<br />
The AE range surprised me since it is far greater than the aggro range. In one case he was pulled out of the lair and well into the setup area. I went and sat down close the the back wall of the lair and the DoT got me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Staying out or away from the fight is not possible, the damage that Yelinak can dish out is very high and within 3 minutes of the fight I am needed to heal. The fights lasted long enough for one of the warriors to cycle through defensive (7min recycle).<br />
<br />
I like the idea of being CoH'd in as the Mages are more or less delegated to dragging corpses to the res clerics. Only problem is putting a mage in with the clerics and tanks. Maybe CoH would work on bringing up some fresh enchanters though since when they go OOM you can no longer get c2.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of trying to see if the AE was on a certain timer so I could DA/DB avoid it. Sorta like how the ToV drakes cast their DoT's every 8 10 or 12 seconds depending on type.</div></div><hr />
