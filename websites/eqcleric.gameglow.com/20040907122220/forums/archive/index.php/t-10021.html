As I remeber the old nerf in dots was on mobs that where run to/after you and not from you...since druids where the ones that where sow kiteing alot they lost a great deal on this nerf..but doesn't necros do a reverse kite..fear kite..the mobs run from you and take full damage of the dot ?<br />

At least this is how people think it worked, since it's hard to measure each DoT tick. Even when soloing and fear breaks, the mob would head for the necro and then the DoTs would do less damage. <br />

Please explain this to me...<br />
<br />
<br />
Talked to a nec friend about this.  The DoT nerf never affected the necroes ability to fear kite, but it did affect their ability to *reverse* kite.  That is, they snare and DoT the mob and then run around the zone while the pet beats the mob in the rear.  The advantage of this over fear kiting is that you can control the mobs pathing and significantly reduce the possibility the mob will path into another mob in dangerous areas.<br />
<br />
Druids, on the other hand, are usually better off quad kiting with AE's which were never affected by the DoT nerf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">myth24601</div><div class="date">07-24-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;&gt;Now that dot kiting has been unnerfed (after 2+ years), maybe they will stop asking for better heals?&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I doubt it since Druids want heals more for the raid/Grouping part of the game where DOTs are rarely used and where the DOT nerf really didn't apply when they were used.  This change helps Druids and Necros some in soloing but not at all as far as grouping goes.<br />
<br />
In most EXP groups, Druids wouldn't use DOTs since MOBs go down too fast for the DOT to be worth the mana.  Another reason against using DOTs in groups is that DOTs prevent Mez type spells from working for more than a tick so in groups with Bard/Ench/Necros the DOT damage wasn't worth the hassle.  If they are used, the Nerf doesn't matter since these groups are based on Tanking MOBs, not kiting.  Even in &quot;ping-pong&quot; situations, the DOT penalty wouldnt take effect since MOBs usually don't run around for long.<br />
<br />
On raids, DOTs are efficiant but of limited use.  Since DOTs can't stack, the only Druid DOT used on raids is Winged Death which means that any other Druids on the Raid would have to Nuke to do damage.  In some Raids, Druids don't bother with DOTs anyway since they are frequntly on Heal duty anyway.<br />
<br />
As far as how the DOT change will make a differance, we will see.  It's been so long since Druids could DOT kite and at the highest levels, Nukes are almost as good DOTs anyway.  Also, Root/Rott on MOBs does allow you to MED which in most cases, does regen more mana than the Root uses and the Root does some damage to boot.<br />

This tactic is called root dotting, root cooking or root 'n' rot.<br />

IMO, druids have the most important and essential raid function and thus should be content. <br />
<br />
1) Port Clerics to Raid <br />

<br />
Actually to you cleric I would say walk to the raid. Secondly the dot thing only really helps druids when soloing. Its basically useless to a raid situation. So no thats not going to make druids as you say &quot;shut up&quot;.<br />
<br />
In my experience some clerics are the most spoiled selfish creatures to ever exist on eq. They are perfectly willing to use their status as most needed to get items that could better serve other classes just to sell them. They charge 200-300pp just for a rez even when they just have to click a stick to do it. <br />
<br />
God forbid anyone heal anywhere close to what a cleric does. Clerics can now nuke almost as well as druids. Heck why not just make clerics sow and port and just eliminate druids altogether?<br />
<br />
Druids in reality or probably the least powerful class in everquest. Ever play a druid and try to get a group? Even in our own guilds we are treated like port whores by clerics and warriors. Other classes seem to be a bit less crappy to druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He said cleric nuke as well as druids? What are you smoking and can you share!<br />
<br />
Not all clerics &quot;just click&quot; to cast rez. Most of us still have to sit, mem, and use up a good chunk of mana since RF is NOT an easy to get mob (unlike the drood epic).<br />
<br />
YES, druids CAN solo. They can do pretty much anything they want. They CAN be helpful in raid situations, just not as powerful in raids as they are in other areas of they game. <br />
<br />
Yes, god forbid another class coming in with similar heals and a whole plethora of other skills to boot. Why oh why would clerics feel threatened when another class wants to make them obselete! I didn't just waste 2 years dealing with the fact I can't solo, travel, melee, nuke worth a darn (till I got Judgement), no pet, no real dots, snares, etc... just so that I could be a prime healer. If you want to be the best healers, then MAKE A CLERIC AND DEAL WITH OUR LIMITATIONS!<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, the dot damage change helps kiters and reverse/fear kiters to the same degree. A moving mobs is a moving mobs. This just increased dot effectivness by 20% if I'm not mistaken. I believe that is how much it was lowered back when they made the infamous &quot;dot changes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

That is their unigue ability that makes them useful. <br />
<br />
The problem that I see and most druids see with our class is that we have no unique ability that is outstanding for raid/groups. Thus we arent wanted or used. Yeah I can solo all the way to 60 in half the time a cleric can. What good does it do when virtually all of the good high end parts of the game are made for groups or raids? Believe me I would gladly sacrifice my ability to quad kite for some unique ability that makes me more usable in groups. <br />
<br />
Druids have these abilities..<br />
nuking--wizards do it far better<br />
snaring-ranger can do it and melee<br />
dotting-necros do it more efficiently<br />
healing-no comparison to what a cleric can do<br />
sowing and buffing-shamans have much better buffs<br />
porting-wizards do it better and more efficiently<br />
quad kiting-wizards again out do us at high level.<br />
pet-rofl is that what that bear is?<br />
charming animals-how often do you really see a animals in a raid?<br />
stopping rain-ugh our only real unique ability..that is sad.<br />

<br />
<br />
This comes down to cash flow.  While some clerics are indeed greedy and only created the class with money in mind, keep in mind that many clerics are exceptionally poor.<br />
<br />
We can't solo well.  We can't track rares.  We are called away from what camps we attempt because someone in the guild died and didn't take a cleric with them because they didn't want to split the camp's loot.<br />
<br />
Due to our reagent costs, many squeek by on money to keep playing (not even talking about equipment upgrades).  There is NOTHING I would like better than for reagent costs to be removed from clerics.  Perhaps at that point non-greedy clerics that have had to bow to becoming Verant's mercenary res-dealers and loot-misers would be able to break out of this reputation of being greedy.<br />
<br />
I have had people in my former guild imply that I was greedy.  This after having paid for multiple Kael raids per week's peridots out of my own pockets.  I begged and pleaded for a guild fund, it was agreed to, and nothing ever happened---twice.  I waited a bit for ANYONE to come to my defense, and left when no one did.  So much for the small family style guild.  When I left that guild, I was down to 30 peridots and 50 platinum and not a scrap of Kael equipment to show for it, yet somehow I am a greedy cleric.  There are few terms that bring my ire up in EQ greater than that insinuation.  Blame Verant about reagents, don't blame clerics for needing to buy them.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, this board is getting to the point where we can't go three minutes without an anti-druid post, or a thread like this, which is hijacked into an anti-druid post.<br />

I don't really care what druids have. If I want what a druid has, then I'll make a druid. I hear they're not too hard to level  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Otherwise, I'm happy with my cleric, even if we can't solo, port, SoW, invis, etc. <br />

I'm not sure why everyone is jealous of druids. I'm probably more jealous of shaman  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif They can group and solo pretty well.. and they got SoW, levitate and invis. That's why I play a shaman some times. Mine's level 25, atm. <br />

<br />
Resistance check has nothing to do with specialization. But this does bring up a good point that I haven't seen made. Most druids don't specialize in alteration, almost all clerics do. This explains some of the discrepancy in cleric-to-druid healing. Sure healing ratio is skewed to favor clerics, but it is also about choices that clerics make in game. We are truly a specialized class, druids are indeed not.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what Clerics charge 200-300p per Rez but I know that I usually never take more then 100p(If I take anything at all. mostly do Rez's for free) unless I don't look at how much is being given or they are in a &quot;Uber&quot; Guild(this is only if thats what they want to pay.). <br />
<br />
Of course I've had a Druid demand payment for a port then when we get there ask me for a FREE rez since I was running by.<br />
