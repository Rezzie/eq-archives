<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knot Ninefingers</div><div class="date">01-26-2000, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to the cleric I now play, I have played a ranger up to level 39.  There are some easy (but still time consuming and expensive) ranger quests.  Nothing as easy as picking up a couple items off the ground  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
However, there are some items that are a real pain to get.  First is the legs.  You kill pixies (not as fun as it sounds) until you get a brownie outcast to spawn.  Kill Brownie outcast (need to be level 40+ to solo).  He will drop one of 6 nodrop arrows.  Kill more pixies.  Hope the arrow(s) you need drop.  I spent 10 hours killing pixies before I got all 6 arrows.  And that was the easy part.  The hard part is killing a thief in OOT.  Sit by buccaneer.  Watch it spawn and despawn for 15-20 hours.  If you are lucky you are the only one there.  Kill thief (again, soloable around level 40 or so).  Hope that the cyclopes on island don't steal your kill.  Hope that thief drops quiver.  Finish quest and realize silver plated legs are just as good.  Smack self for wasting 36 hours and dying 3 times on this quest.  Switch back to cleric.<br />
<br />
The other extremely painful quests are the boots and the gauntlets--I will not go into detail on those.  I think ranger armor was a bit easier to get because high level rangers suck.  No high level outdoor zones.  Druid/warrior combo makes you pretty much useless.  People want real tanks, druids to heal/snare/evac.  With my green armor and a couple proc weapons I was actually able to solo some high greens/low blues in Guk and get exp, which made me feel a little better about not being able to get into groups.  CLERICS DON'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM SO QUIT YER BITCHIN.<br />
<br />
Clerics do fine without their quest armor.  And suddenly rubicite is no good?  <br />
<br />
I would like to see the manastone as one of those pain in the butt campathon quests though.<br />

High level rangers rock!  He plays one.  Getting into groups?  We're always so happy that he's there.  Snare, SoW (if not indoors), melee (dual wielding two EBW's he is damn FAST).  My usual group is paladin, warrior, monk, ranger, wizard, and me.  And if the ranger isn't there, we're not nearly as happy taking a different class.<br />
Oh, and ranger quests?  I helped him on some.  He said the legs weren't worth it, although he did the quest and he said it was an annoyance.  During this I helped another ranger friend with the arrows from the brownie outcasts.  He had half of the arrows inside an hour.  Took us 5 minutes with Meldrath - granted there were 6 of us.  Now, the time consumed with my ranger friends helping me TRY to find Zahal/Regis - either one, didn't matter to me - far outweighed the time it took him to do any one of his quests, and no we did not ever see either one once.  <br />
A ranger IS a real tank.  If I'm in a group and we need another tank, we do not turn our noses up at a ranger and are glad to take one.  Oh, and btw, my one friend is 44, and the other is 37 - both are rangers and neither one will agree that high level rangers suck.<br />

I helped a ranger friend, both of us mid 30's, camp Wiltin.  Yes, it got old after a while.  But at least we had a placeholder to watch, and could time the 70 minute cycle so that one of us could go afk for meals, etc.  Total time spent there?  Over a couple days, about 10 hours - same as you.  Now... let's talk about Gull -- another OOT spawn.  Total time spent looking for Gull?  10 hours doesn't even come CLOSE.  I took a level 12 character out there, and got to level 16, without seeing him.  Then, did like Alli suggested, and took a ranger out there and checked every time I logged on and logged off.  After TWO WEEKS of this misery, my ranger friend happened to be passing through the zone and spotted Gull on tracking, and got him for me.<br />
<br />
Now, for the funny part -- my ranger friend did his legs, and got a nice experience bump.  A couple weeks later, doing my cleric vambraces, he got none...  <br />
<br />
NO ranger out there who regularly groups with a cleric thinks their quests are anything but EASY compared to the cleric quests.  And if you think your ranger sucks, maybe it's the player -- it sure isn't the class!  Like Elessara, I prefer to have my ranger friend in the group -- they add buffs that no cleric can cast (agility, strength) as well as sow, snare, enduring breath, etc.  Try casting buffs on your party with your ranger, you'll find them pleasantly surprised -- and you'll find that long-term your oppportunities to group increase...<br />
<br />
In our group, all around 39th, the ranger is the primary tank -- our secondary is a monk.  So high level rangers can do just fine...<br />

Your quests are NOTHING in complexity, time, or frustration factor compared to clerics'.  I see MANY, MANY Rangers running around my server with their armor and have yet to see ONE cleric in a complete set of ours.<br />
<br />
I don't think Rangers are a true tank, more like a half tank.  Most of the Rangers I know just can't take the damage a warrior or paladin can.  But still, I haven't heard of any rangers in my guild having trouble getting non-guild groups.  Perhaps you need to review how to play a ranger.<br />

Fare thee well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">01-26-2000, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see, rangers quests.  Oh yea, I did them all except for the boots (which the ranger is able to do mostly solo, he's made one pair, and if wasn't for the melatite would have the next done also).<br />
<br />
The vast majority of those quests are EASY for a group to do, if one has a group willing to assist.  Since almost every part of the quest gave us experience or took little time (Grimfeather taking little time, just gated into NK at the beginning and end of every evening, killed him when he was up x 2) we gladly did them all.  Beat the hell out of camping Rubi for our rangers.<br />
<br />
The leggings took several nights to accomplish for two pairs.  A group of us got together and gathered the twelve arrows we needed in one evening.  It took maybe 4 hours of non-stop outcast/pixe killing.  Kinda fun to do once.  We then moved to OOT and sat on Gornit, killing him and seafuries repeatedly until Wiltin was killed twice.  So while it might have taken four nights, we made lots of money and experience while &quot;camping&quot; him.<br />
<br />
The gloves weren't bad either.  I forget the 2nd piece, but we camped in Slaythe's room in LGuk and just worked the area while we got the items.  Also picked up two ebonies while we were at it.<br />
<br />
Just cannot feel sorry for a ranger on these quests.  Clerics do indeed do well without their armor; hell, I could be effective naked, but that's the difference between meleers and casters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keryath</div><div class="date">01-26-2000, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to point out I've done the ranger legs quest FIVE times so far, and in the middle of doing it a sixth. Why?<br />
<br />
I get xp.<br />
<br />
*Lots* of xp. At low 40's I get between a quarter to an eigth of a bubble for making the armor, not to mention brownies are *good* xp, and while camping for the quiver guy, hey, lookie there, &quot;HI GORNIT!&quot; <br />
<br />
I'd like to point out that I made some ranger boots too. Annoying, but gnomes and clockworks are *also* good xp.<br />
<br />
I think the only quest you have any right to whine about at all is the gloves quest, that one *is* kinda irritating, but hah, try *MY* glove quest bucko.<br />
<br />
All in all you got some quester armor that has the same AC as rubi +stats. In addition, you have some decently fun quests, all your quests give *good* xp, AND YOU GET TO KILL XP MOBS THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE DAMN QUEST.<br />
<br />
So before you pop off again, go sit in kerra ridge for 40 hours and realize the only thing in that zone that doesn't con green is *you*.<br />
<br />

btw- Rangers don't suck, just some of the players do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knot Ninefingers</div><div class="date">01-27-2000, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, alright.  I hope you didn't infer that I said ranger quests were harder than cleric quests.    They're not.  The point is that rangers need good armor to be good, whereas for clerics, most of the pieces are worthless.  However, you don't see groups turning down clerics without quest armor in favor of rangers with green stuff.  Clerics are the most valuable group member, for healing, buffs, damage, and resurrection.  Rangers are a lot more replaceable.  For instance, the person that described his usual group would, in my opinion, be better off with a druid for backup evac, more healing power, and a lot more damage capability.  <br />
<br />
I loved playing a ranger but at high levels the things that were appealing don't exist anymore -- expoloring, tracking mobs you've never seen, the whole outdoors bit.  Ya just sit in dungeons for the most part (never got high enough for planes).<br />
<br />
One problem I had with the legs quest that above people did not was that nobody wanted to sit and camp Wiltin with me.  At level 37-39 I would have a very hard time taking out seafuries or Gornit solo.  So I just sat with no exp gain, wishing I were doing something fun.  Again, I'm not saying cleric quests are any better, but there are non-cleric quests that are almost as painful (though like I said there were pieces that were VERY easy).  I just finished sitting in a burned out cabin for longer than I'd care to for some silly purple boots that add to dex...not sure why I even bothered to do it...I think that the bigger, more fixable problem with the quest armor is the poor stats.  <br />
<br />
But we don't really need it anyway.  Rubicite and wis gear works fine for me.  Groups still beg for me to join them -- as a ranger with green armor I could sit for hours without getting a group in L guk and Sol B.  I think that the quest armor was used to balance out the classes a little bit, which is why clerics get boned.<br />
<br />
By the way, the cleric is my first character and the ranger is my second. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knot Ninefingers</div><div class="date">01-27-2000, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yeah one more thing.  I was a damn good ranger.  Anyone I grouped with will confirm this.  I'm just not patient enough to wait for spawns, or groups, etc. for hours when I could be doing something (as a lower level ranger you dont wait for much -- you don't have to sit long to heal, you can solo, you get all the food and drink you need without going to town, you can track monsters instead of waiting for them to appear, etc).<br />
<br />
So don't give me that crap about not knowing how to play.  The problem getting groups has 3 causes: ignorance on the part of other players, druid+war/pal in the group already, and OVERCROWDING!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ara</div><div class="date">01-28-2000, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Knot, you need to take a chill pill and stay on the issue.<br />
<br />
Don't compare grouping with clerics vs rangers and being turned down because of quest armour.<br />
<br />
You forget that rangers are tanks with snare.  There are 10 tanks out there for 1 cleric/shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't turn down rangers because they may be in banded, I turn them down because there is too friggin many of them.  I believe the SolB king list has a shorter list for healers and ench than tanks.<br />
<br />
You say that you are upset because you friend won't help you camp the greaves.  Umm.  I don't know anyone in their right mind who would co-camp a cleric spawn.  Usually friends stop by and say hi through pity, but leave after 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Don't fly off the handle in defence of rangers when the issue is clear as a bell.  The people here in no way attacked you and you respond with side-tracking dribble.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ixcor</div><div class="date">02-10-2000, 06:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked at the cleric quests in relation to the ranger quests. Both are equally hard, and there are some quest portions that a cleric or ranger can do solo.  However, there are other portions of the quests that I know neither a cleric or ranger can do solo unless they are very high level.  In the case of a ranger, the griffon in Northern Karanas named Grimfeather and Meldrath from minotaur caves of steamfont comes to mind.  I had to get help to complete those portions.  <br />
<br />
As to high level rangers, they still contribute to the survival of a party.  We are on the list as tanks not as healers.  I've noted at times there are alot less healers than tanks.  Clerics are always in demand for a group, unlike my ranger in which i sometimes stay at a zone border yelling for a group and never get one or get on a list and never called.  It's one of the reasons why i made a second character a cleric.  Clerics always have no problem getting into a group.<br />
