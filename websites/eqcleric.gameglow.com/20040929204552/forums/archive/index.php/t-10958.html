<br />
Here are some examples of what we can do/have done:<br />
Servilious/Trakanon/Gorenaire (with 3 deaths)<br />
<br />
We are on +CoV faction<br />
<br />
We seem to be able to get 6-7 groups together pretty much at all times with approx 60-70% of those people being 55+. We have an overabundance of druids and pallys but short on mages and wizards. We have a few 60 warriors but only 1 with epic. We have 2 epic clerics, 1 epic chanter, and a few other asorted epics. We are just now going to start HoT raids.<br />
<br />
What would you all see as our next step as far as large targets? Somebody else mentioned Zlandicar as the next rotation we should enter...what are your thoughts<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

We wiped out on Gore badly, but managed to kill Vindi and Dozekar easily enough.<br />

Lord Bob<br />
HoT armor farms whenever possible, Doze if you get a shot at him<br />
Vindi<br />
The Va`Dyn<br />
HP cycle in Acrylia for some Gaego and other nifty spells<br />
Telk/Gozz  ToV west wing (everyone at kindly or better so fac hit doesnt drop to KoS)<br />
<br />
<br />
Dont do Arena before doing Telk/Gozz  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  Do it after to fix faction, dont let people /q out to save faction hit, make them take the hit, all to often a raid will wipe because everyone wanted to avoid the hit and all of a sudden at the end you dont have enough people to finish off the dragon and then it regens faster than you can do damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Know the comparisons of the SS vs Thurg and use your gems accordingly.  As long as your going to be working in the Arena it's safe to say that you'll be getting max ally to CoV and SS is often much nicer armor.  It's light years ahead Kunark/Olde World.  That doesnt mean you should let Thurg stuff rot, but since you might have people with much more limited play time, it's a lot easier for them to run armor quests at Kindly in Thurgadin then your die hard players to get Ally to Skyshrine and do the HoT armor quests.  Takes a bit longer to get the SS, but it's worth it overall and everyone gets nice loots in the end.  <br />
<br />
Dropping VtS/Vindi/The Va`Dyn and doing the HP cycle are going to be immediate pay offs for you because the loot can be very nice for where your guild/alliance is right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

In fact I would say a touch harder.  The other suggestions were all good too.  I dont know what it is like on your server but the hardest part for my guild is not taking down the mobs but finding them up.  I think that is why we like Doom so much since she is spawned if you keep track of when she was last spawned you can more easily get that mob.</div></div><hr />

after focusing on gearing up your guild in HoT (drops there are ridiculously often), <br />
shoot for velk, vindi, doomshade and then rumblecrush (using what you learned from the rampage mob rhag2)..<br />
