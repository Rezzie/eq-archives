<br />
I'm talking about sucking it up and heading on over to the Druids Grove boards to see if it's really as bad as some people ranting here claim.<br />
<br />
It's worse.<br />
<br />
I started reading the &quot;Cleric response&quot; thread.  I've seen some hate-filled posts by clerics here regarding druids...those posts have got nothing on some of the things druids are saying about clerics right now...you can fill the icy wind coming off of some of the comments, they're that cold.  For every one post that said &quot;let's just wait and see what happens&quot; or &quot;maybe clerics are getting the shaft&quot;, there were at least 8 or 9 posts that just ripped into clerics.  I honestly...honestly...never knew that the majority of the druid community had such contempt for clerics.  There were certain posts that just made me drop my jaw in astonishment.<br />
<br />
You know what, if they're gonna say things like that about clerics, then maybe I need to rethink my opinion that they need something to help them in raid situations.  They can go quad stuff until they're blue in the face for all I care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyena</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason druids are getting so upset is the number of clerics (and a few other classes) coming there telling us we shouldn't get any upgrades while listing the upgrades they want. It is a druid board and we are tired of seeing lists of stuff clerics want. Clerics should be bringing up their needs on a cleric board and not a druid board. And going to another board and telling people that you are just fine and don't need any enhancements just doesn't go over well. Just imagine what the reaction here would be if I started a thread that said clerics are overpowered already and don't need any enhancements, but I need these enhancements for my class. I think it would go over like a fart in a spacesuit.<br />
<br />
The thing that most clerics over there don't see is druids don't begrudge clerics any reasonable upgrades and actually welcome them and hope for the best for clerics. I wouldn't care if clerics got a self sow, self invis, self ds, self ports, self lev, snares and ae nukes and could quad kite their little hearts out. Basically, I think anything that VI will give you is fine and probably not quite enough. I will be happy for you when you do get the improvements too. I just want to know why so many of the clerics that post on the druid boards (not all clerics) seem to have such a disdain for druids and druid upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velisaris</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to know why so many of the clerics that post on the druid boards (not all clerics) seem to have such a disdain for druids and druid upgrades. <br />
<br />
I don't go posting on other class boards, but I can tell you where my distaste for druids comes from.<br />
<br />
Up until about level 35 or so, no matter where I went to find a group, every night I had to listen to this: Group looking for healer with SOW.  Every damn day...and every day I struggled to find a group.  In addition, there was a druid in my guild (my first guild) who is one of those druids that give all druids a bad name...arrogant, egotistical, loud, coniving, rude, and in the biggest friggin' hurry to get to 60.  She was my first real exposure to the druid class, therefore I formed my opinion of all druids based on her actions.<br />
<br />
But then, I got Complete Heal and hit the low 40's...I came into my own and became a cleric.  People needed me...people wanted me for groups.  So, I started to rethink my stance on druids and realized that they weren't all bad...it just turns out that the majority of idiots I meet in the game are druids, not necessarily that all druids are idiots.<br />
<br />
So, fast forward to today.  It takes a whole lot of time before any druid I meet proves to me that they're not anything like that first druid I formed an impression of.  Now, I'm feeling like I did when I first started out...competing with other classes who can do EXACTLY the same job I can do, but have more to offer.<br />
<br />
And that's why druids score so low in my book.</div></div><hr />

Probably the same if druids posted here, the negative ones stand out and the majority who are quite reasonable get forgotten. On the other hand if VI had started with clerics, I'm sure we'd have seen the same thing going on here thats going on on the druid board.<br />

Erm.. this thread started of a druid(?) linked to the cleric board - opened by a cleric who brought up his concerns on the cleric board /shrug<br />
<br />
I barely visit DG anymore - too much whining and constantly bashing on other classes.</div></div><hr />

I mean that from a programming point, not a hateful persective. They do a little of everything. They are mad cuz they cant heal as well, and are passed by when a shammy or something is lfg, and most of all clerics, cuz they really have no speciallty in a group. Shammys have mad buff and dot, clerics have heals, wizzies have nukes, and bards can do songs AND fight. I think someone should tell them A. that they are luck that they CAN solo light blues and B) if they are mad at all this stuff....DONT BE A DRUID!::sigh::<br />

<br />
The druids get po'ed when one class gets upgraded because all their skills are spread out throughout ALL classes and they feel if one class they mimick is getting more skill they should too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selenite</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as both a Cleric and a Druid, I have observed one thing..  Clerics whine almost as much as Druids, and both classes whine far too much.<br />
<br />
Both Clerics and Druids are pretty good as-is, if Druids would begin to understand that being superfluous is not equal to being useless, and if Clerics would accept that they're not in as dismal a state as a lot of people seem to insist.<br />
<br />
And of course, if both classes would stop begrudging the other upgrades.  As a Druid, I prefer to blow stuff up - but for the druids that prefer to heal, a healing upgrade is needed.  And as a Cleric, I never have any trouble, my healing is so superior to my Druid's I often need to play Cleric instead.<br />
<br />
But overall, I find there's just far too much whining in both camps, and *way* too much looking across and saying 'hey, they're getting X!  No way!'.  And while a lot of people *do* consider what would be balanced and good, and don't do so much whining, it tends to be drowned out by the massive amounts of whining and complaining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because clerics were pretty much the last remaining class that hadn't had their unique abilities just HANDED to druids. When you stop and think about it, Verant has taken every single thing that made each class unique, and given it to the druid class. There is no class/ability that druids haven't been allowed to mimic. Often to the point of actually being given BETTER versions.<br />
<br />
CH was the one thing that Clerics had that they didn't. And it ate them ALIVE. From the inside out. They've been spewing bile for a very long time now because Clerics had better heals than they did.<br />
<br />
And now.... well... they've got that too. <br />
<br />
Like I've been saying. REZ is next. If you don't think so... you are in for a BIG surprise. <br />
<br />
The same basic arguements that allowed them to co-opt our healing ability (and wizards porting/nuking ability, and necro's dot/snare ability, and shaman's buffing/pet ability, and Ranger's tracking ability, and bard charming abilities... etc. etc. etc..) will be used to co-opt the rez ability. After all... &quot;it's not fair that in the high end game there is only one class that can rez&quot; right? <br />
<br />
Read the PETITION for cripes sake. They're especially PO'd that Aego overwrites thier SKIN spells. They want that stopped too. <br />
<br />
Like I've been saying since the first minute of this travesty. It's NOT about CLERICS vs. DRUIDS. It's about Verant's obsession with making sure that druids are allowed to co-opt every single good and unique thing from every other class. <br />
<br />
THINK about it for a second. <br />
<br />
If not for druids:<br />
<br />
Shaman's would be sought after almost exclusively for thier SoWs and buffs.<br />
Wizards would be sought after almost exclusively for thier nukes and ports.<br />
Rangers would be sought after almost exclusively for thier tracking ability.<br />
Clerics would be sought after almost exclusively for thier healing ability.<br />
Necro's would be sought after highly for thier DoT's, and mana heals. <br />
<br />
I could go on, and on and on...<br />
<br />
And they wonder why they are universally reviled? Puh-leaze. <br />

<br />
Healing is a unique cleric ability? Since when? There are three healing classes that get heals at level one, and three healing class hybrids that get heals at their first spell level of nine. Then there are other classes that have other forms of heals as well. This has been in the game since the begining.<br />
<br />
CH was the one thing that Clerics had that they didn't. And it ate them ALIVE. From the inside out. They've been spewing bile for a very long time now because Clerics had better heals than they did.<br />
<br />
Druids don't want CH and aren't getting CH. If you ran a poll on the druid boards asking if druids should get CH, you would find that those that want it would likely be in the single digits. Most druids just want a heal in the 50%-66% range.<br />
<br />
The same basic arguements that allowed them to co-opt our healing ability (and wizards porting/nuking ability, and necro's dot/snare ability, and shaman's buffing/pet ability, and Ranger's tracking ability, and bard charming abilities... etc. etc. etc..) will be used to co-opt the rez ability. After all... &quot;it's not fair that in the high end game there is only one class that can rez&quot; right?<br />
<br />
Okay, healing has never been a cleric only ability. Druids and other classes have always had nukes. Druids had ports BEFORE wizards did. Druids never wanted a dot/snare combo and are actually relieved they are removing the snare component from our epic on test. Druids have never asked for shaman like stat buffs, we have always only had one stat buff and it is only a distant second to the shaman buff. Druids and bards have had lesser versions of tracking forever. And lastly, a druid started a post about resses the other day and he was scoffed by other druids and his post moved to the rant section.<br />
<br />
Read the PETITION for cripes sake. They're especially PO'd that Aego overwrites thier SKIN spells. They want that stopped too.<br />
<br />
Yes, they do. And as a cleric you should want that too. As it is now, a cleric does mgb aego, then some casters click it off and get potg and symbol for the extra mana regen. Of course, the buffs don't have the same duration, so sometime later (after potg has been refreshed already) a cleric redoes aego. Now every caster that had symbol and potg has to click off aego and get potg and symbol again (more peridots). All druids would like to see is aego get bounced off of potg the same way potg bounces off of aego. It would save both druids and clerics much mana and save clerics peridots. I can't believe your hatred for druids is so severe you would actually prefer to leave something in place that hurts your class just to hurt druids as well.<br />
<br />
Like I've been saying since the first minute of this travesty. It's NOT about CLERICS vs. DRUIDS. It's about Verant's obsession with making sure that druids are allowed to co-opt every single good and unique thing from every other class.<br />
<br />
Okay, why don't you list these abilities that druids are stealing? What have druids gotten that they didn't have a form of already since the game started that was taken from another class? The only really new skills druids have gotten that I can come up with off the top of my head are the ability to stop the rain (stolen from no one), the pet (multiple pet classes, but none with a pet that bad at that level, more of a fun toy than a real pet), fire debuffs (no one else has a fire only debuff, but a few other classes have a fire debuff). And the fire debuff isn't really new since Ice at level 49 includes a fire debuff.<br />
<br />
The biggest part I don't understand on both sides is people disliking another class so much that they would begrudge that class an upgrade even if it is the best for the game. I am glad they are giving clerics the ability to solo, I am glad they are upgrading remedy and divine light for clerics, and I am glad for the other spells they are adding to help clerics out. I was super happy our clerics could buy faithstones so they wouldn't be stranded when they bound in out of the way places. And if clerics get other spell upgrades, I will be happy since it only makes my groups and my guild stronger. I guess maybe the big difference is some of us are playing a PvE game while others are playing a class vs class game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greycloak</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing is a unique cleric ability? Since when?  <br />
<br />
Nobody was even attempting to make that argument. The context of the thread was &quot;Complete Heal&quot; - something that... up until the current debacle had most certainly been unique to the Cleric class. Like I said, just take a walk on over to the Grove and check out the hate being spewed over there because, well... we had it, and they didn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids don't want CH and aren't getting CH. <br />
ROTFL... really... what planet are YOU from? <br />
Yes you do. And yes you are. <br />
<br />
lastly, a druid started a post about resses the other day and he was scoffed by other druids  <br />
Like I said, this time last year we were scoffing at the idea that CH would be anything but Cleric only. You see where we are today. <br />
<br />
Okay, why don't you list these abilities that druids are stealing?  <br />
I did. *Twice*.<br />
<br />
If you need yet ANOTHER example then just take a look at the Wizzy Luclin ports. Remember the great fanfare about Wizards becoming the &quot;Masters of Arcane Transportation!&quot;? Wizards were promised that they would have a set of ports no other class would have, and that they would be unique, and &quot;necessary&quot;. The now famous Druid petition pointed out that Wizards had 'em. Druids wanted 'em. You see the outcome. Druids not only got Wizzie's  Luclin ports, but got them when they actually worked. The short period of time Wizards actually HAD something that the druids didn't, the ports didnt' actually work. You already had to be on the moon to port around the moon. WTH was THAT all about? When druids asked for (and got) Wizzie's  Luclin ports - they were made to work properly, and from anywhere. How nice. <br />
<br />
This example typifies my entire point. <br />
<br />
<br />
All druids would like to see is aego get bounced off of potg the same way potg bounces off of aego <br />
LOL... I'm sure you would. Then the onus would shift to another class. It's YOUR ox being gored, and you don't like it. And, as is typical of a class that has always gotten what it wanted, it never occurs to you that some Clerics might like things just the way they are.<br />
<br />
I will be happy since it only makes my groups and my guild stronger.<br />
You can afford to be. It's not your uniqueness and groupability that's at stake now, is it? <br />
<br />
I guess maybe the big difference is some of us are playing a PvE game while others are playing a class vs class game.<br />
This is exactly my point. Because druids are so prolific they probably comprise a sizeable percentage of the paying player base. It's in Verants financial self interest to make sure that the most common class, played by the most people are kept happy, they do this by making sure that when druids want something, they get it. This is unfortunate at best, and terribly unfair to all the other players NOT playing a druid. <br />
<br />
Is it the druids fault that things shake out this way? Of course not. If the classes I played were the &quot;teacher's pets&quot; so to speak, I'd probably be more than pleased that everything goes my way all the time. It would be hypocritical to suggest otherwise. But part of the down-side to being the teachers pet is the hostility directed at you by others. You can't have it both ways. It's not your fault that your class has unfair advantages, but... it's not our fault we don't care for it much either. If your looking for sympathy, trust me, you came to the WRONG place. <br />
<br />
The BIG point - as I've ranted about in other threads - is that a class who has been handed the ability to quad down every significant camp an entire zone (SD, TD, CS, Grey, etc..) well into their AAXP at level 60, shouldn't be allowed to be raid powerhouses as well. Other classes have to suffer under the almighty &quot;BALANCE&quot; yoke, choosing between killer solo ability, or desirablity in a group. Druids should have to live with the same boot on their neck. Giving them CH effectively removes this restriction, and makes them desireable in &quot;raid-level encounters&quot; (the stated goal of &quot;The Petition&quot;) in addition to being soloing monsters. <br />
<br />
For you to say that druids do not want, and are not getting CH is intellectually dishonest.<br />
<br />
And you know it. <br />

<br />
It costs an opal and won't work on snow. :(<br />
<br />
If you need yet ANOTHER example then just take a look at the Wizzy Luclin ports.<br />
<br />
Once again since you seem kind of slow. Druids had ports BEFORE wizards. But even though druids had ports FIRST, they are still second best without the ability to port to PoA, PoH, or translocate people.<br />
<br />
ROTFL... really... what planet are YOU from? <br />
Yes you do. And yes you are.<br />
<br />
Just because one druid posts that they think druids should have CH doesn't mean all druids want CH. From a poll of druids on what percentage heal druids should get, 50% was the winner with over half of the votes. There was no spot for CH, but there was a spot for other, it got 3.1%. So, unless you can prove otherwise, the fact is druids don't want CH. And, this new heal isn't CH no matter what the stupid testers called it. 3K hp is not CH unless you are healing a caster. Heck, with raid buffs on, that wouldn't even be a full 75% heal on me, and wouldn't be a 50% heal on my warrior.<br />
<br />
Then the onus would shift to another class. It's YOUR ox being gored, and you don't like it. And, as is typical of a class that has always gotten what it wanted, it never occurs to you that some Clerics might like things just the way they are.<br />
<br />
Actually, it only costs druids mana to rebuff those casters. It costs clerics both mana and peridots. If you are such an ass that you would rather spend mana and peridots than save mana for druids then I would say the cleric class will be better when you get mad and quit. Fortunately, from what I have seen, clerics like you are as much a minority as druids who want CH.<br />
<br />
Because druids are so prolific they probably comprise a sizeable percentage of the paying player base. It's in Verants financial self interest to make sure that the most common class, played by the most people are kept happy, they do this by making sure that when druids want something, they get it. This is unfortunate at best, and terribly unfair to all the other players NOT playing a druid.<br />
<br />
Once again, your logic is faulty. These are high end changes, and in the high end game, clerics are more common than druids. If you don't believe me, run your own tests. Or better yet, look at the rosters for high end guilds on your server. Just checked on my other comp, and there are 17 level 60 druids and the level 60 cleric list is cut short. Warriors and monks were cut too short, paly's and sk's were both about 15, mages and necros were both at 9, beastlords were non existant, the other classes all ranged between 15 and 20. So, druids don't vastly outnumber the other classes at the high end game.<br />
<br />
For you to say that druids do not want, and are not getting CH is intellectually dishonest.<br />
<br />
For you to say they do is factually dishonest.</div></div><hr />

You are right about that...mages have been totally ignored as far as any upgrades are concerned and definitely NOT sought after for any raids.  This has been brought up ad nauseum to Verant and they do NOTHING.<br />

But let a tear come to the eye of the druid community and Verant will jump through hoops to placate them.  I do not understand why, but I do know that the company is pissing off many of their once satisfied customers.   IMHO</div></div><hr />

&quot;We may whine the same amount, but Druids get results&quot; <br />
<br />
You are right about that...mages have been totally ignored as far as any upgrades are concerned and definitely NOT sought after for any raids.  This has been brought up ad nauseum to Verant and they do NOTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what raids you make, but on our raids, we look for mages. We did Telk with only 3 clerics but around 4-5 mages (not ONLY for mod dropping - but also) Many NToV raids couldn't be hold without mages (CoH). Mages have a place on raids, definately.<br />
<br />
Mages got some upgrades while they were upgrading the pet classes - and if I am right their nukes got better too, but I have to reassure this by my co-worker. Focus items are neat too :)</div></div><hr />

Generally we have 5-6 on a raid; having so many allows them to do other things than just spit out mod rods.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greycloak</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once again since you seem kind of slow. Druids had ports BEFORE wizards. But even though druids had ports FIRST, they are still second best without the ability to port to PoA, PoH, or translocate people.  <br />
Luclin ports were promised to Wizards only. Period. The fact that druids had the ability to port first has nothing to do with the argument at hand. And you have the nerve to say *I'm* slow? YOURE the one playing a dr00d. LOL. 'Nuff said. <br />
<br />
they are still second best without the ability to port to PoA, PoH, or translocate people.  <br />
See? You really can't stand it when another class has something you don't can you? Typical sentiment from one of the hordes of 14 year olds that make up the bulk of the druid class and have always whined for, and gotten what they wanted. I think this alone makes the very point I've been ranting about. Boom! There ya have it. <br />
<br />
Actually, it only costs druids mana to rebuff those casters. It costs clerics both mana and peridots. <br />
Are you REALLY dumb enough to think that I'll stand there and recast symbol after some caster has clicked it off to get a DRUID buff? Again... I suggest that perhaps your the one who's a little slow. <br />
<br />
clerics are more common than druids<br />
You are obviously a hopeles n00b Without the sense that Brell gave a common goose. Wishing it to be true, and pulling make believe numbers out of your... err.... the ether won't make it true. Castersrealm posts the OFFICIAL figures from Verant on a regular basis. They are there for all to see. Clerics NEVER outnumber druids. Even at the high end. Try reading a little bit next time. Perhaps you won't look so foolish.<br />
<br />
 So, unless you can prove otherwise, the fact is druids don't want CH. <br />
Fortunately for me, (and very UNfortunately for you) I have proof in the form of the well posted, and very public Druid Petition, where a representative claiming to speaking for the ENTIRE druid community asked for just exactly that. (in addition to Wizzie's Luclin ports, better DoTs, lower resists, and a handful of abilities taken from OTHER classes) As I say, perhaps if you were a little better read on your own class you'd know that. Pulling figures out of thin air and making percentages up as you type will never stand in the face of that publicly posted petition. May it hang around your collective necks like a millstone. <br />
<br />
And as I've stated before, anyone who thinks the &quot;cap&quot; isn't a ruse to keep the cleric class from open revolt and won't be quietly lifted in a patch 30 or 60 days from now, is quite obviously NOT a veteran of these upgrade wars. It's a tactic that Verant is FAMOUS for. <br />
<br />
You are also very carefully avoiding the main thrust of my point. But I WILL not let it go away.<br />

&quot;What business does a class that can easily solo to 20 AAXP points in level 60 have demanding a place on raids at the high end of the game?&quot;<br />

Until you answer that question. Your putting up strawmen.<br />

Well, I bow to your superior trolldom. Fortunately you don't in any way represent most clerics, and with the type of attitude that you would refuse to buff someone at a raid you obviously aren't high level (unless you bought one on ebay). Heck, I doubt you are actually a cleric. Oh well, someone who has gone so far as to let their envy of another class turn into a hatred isn't worth bothering with.</div></div><hr />

Ahh... you see... the difference is, unlike you, I was simply posting an observation, not attempting to hide behind it to keep from looking foolish. Or obfuscate. Or avoid the question. <br />
<br />
You know... THE QUESTION.<br />
<br />
The one YOU *STILL* haven't answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What business does a class that can easily solo to 20 AAXP points in level 60 have demanding a place on raids at the high end of the game?&quot;  <br />
<br />
(that question)<br />
<br />
Personally, I guess I don't understand why ya'll have you're collective panties in a bunch. You've WON. You've got what you wanted. You've successfully marginalized the one class that could compete with you for groups at the high end, while retaining your ability to monopolize every mob in many zones.  You got (basically) everything you asked for in the petition. What MORE could you possibly want? (I mean... BESIDES rez).<br />
<br />
So why are you trolling on cleric boards looking for sympathy? You should be over on the Grove, crowing about your victory like the rest of the Druids. <br />
<br />
Gratz!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If some one cancels a buff that costs me  dots on a raid..<br />
he/she better have spare dot and the ability to mana pump me if he wants another shot at a hp buff.!<br />
If I a newbie after playing my cleric since 9 june 1999, for thinking this..so.. who gives a f.. u have a serius problem if u feel it is ok, to waste other ppls time/mana and pp so u can have first class service whenever u feel like it. My time and mana is just as important to me as your is to you!<br />
<br />
Let me guess you created your cleric after being told by other cleric that they wouldn't leave their groups so that they could rez your druid, and since you don't respect other ppls time/mana/pp you where forced to create a cleric since no one would be in the same group as you.</div></div><hr />
