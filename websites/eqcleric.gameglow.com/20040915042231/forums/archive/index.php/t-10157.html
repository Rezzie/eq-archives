I will take offers for a few days then look them over and decide. I am a level 32 cleric now and I have all the quest armor except the bracers and chest and don't really want the chest as I am wearing a mithral BP. I already have platinum jewelry all around so don't need that either. I would like to get some good bracers and other items for myself and possibly my druid friend who helped me with the quest.</div></div><hr />
