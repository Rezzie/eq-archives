Go to the 3rd Gate zone and there's 3 ghouls that spawn in front of the Necro guild.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  There is NOTHING better than killing ghouls in front of the Necro guild, trust me on this  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif   Also, since you don't particulary care about DE faction, (unless your a cleric of Innoruuk) in the brothel/bar  The Maidens Fancy (not far from the necro guild) is Ratraz, a Troll Warrior level 19 (Ratraz clubs sell for 5 to 6pp and he's a 9 min spawn) and a rogue about the same level (no loot, cheap bastage).  With 3ppl you will keep ahead of the spawn, maybe.  If you really wanna get wild and have 3 strong or maybe 4 avg chars, finish your cycle with a visit to the library (inbetween the necro guild and Maidens Fancy) and kill the Necro Lokar ToBiath and his pet.  With 2, you'll be getting to new xp every time you move from a kill   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Besides the variety and enjoyment factor of killing inside the Inky city, you will also have a great deal of fun talking to the shocked Necro's that come through town.  I've had great fun with them.  If you could only see the looks on their faces behind the monitor when they see a bunch of lighties killing inside 3rd Gate.<br />
<br />
enjoy!<br />
