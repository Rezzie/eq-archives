<br />
Make sure you have SoW, Levitate and Camo.<br />
Go to the Rygorr Orc fort in EW<br />
Crystal Caverns entrance is in this fort. <br />
Left click on the crystal.<br />
When you enter, make sure you are levitated and have camo.<br />
Go to the first opening into a massive open cavern and get to the bottom of the pit.<br />
There is an opening at the bottom of the pit<br />
Go right and follow it.  This will take you to the town of Frostone.  There is a bank and unless you have an enchanter or someone with a high sneak you can't buy or sell here.  These guards however work like newbie zone guards.<br />
<br />
Go back into the orc tunnel.  There is a wide area in the tunnel here with one static pop.  Pull that static pop and then have puller pull from the pit.  Great xp.  Make sure and root this guys if you don't have someone with snare.  This area should take you to level 36-37.<br />
<br />
Level 37-40 time to go in the back cave.<br />
Go through town on the lower level.<br />
There will be guards in the back.  These again work like newbie guards.<br />
<br />
Broken Bridge - there are 4 stalag terrors down here and they hit hard and stun.  You and a heavy hitting tank should be able to get you to 44 in no time.  Remember to root if you have no snarer.  For puling purposes, jump the bridge and there is a hallway leading off, great pull spot...<br />
<br />
44-46<br />
Geonids are great for loots but I found the loop in CC much easier and faster.  I had 2 monks in my group and I leveled with an hour and half.  45 did go slower though.<br />
<br />
The loop - claim the stalag terror hall and the spiders including the queen.  Start going down the spider halls and killing everything when you complete this part go to the entrance of the spider hall and then left down the stalag hall.  Root the left stalag and let your fighters pummel these things.  Doing the loop with an enchanter with AOE Mez rocks too...<br />
