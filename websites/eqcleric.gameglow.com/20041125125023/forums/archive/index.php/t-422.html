<br />
   Tickraw is currently a 20th Halfling Cleric and has been for a couple months now. I just lost interest and quit playing him. I was getting bored with Unrest and some of the &quot;lower life forms&quot; that inhabit it (And I am not talking MOBs!). I made 20 and stuck my head in Mistmoore and saw some of the MOB's that were being pulled to the entrance and quickly decided against that zone for a couple more levels. <br />
<br />
    I have to say, after reading the guides, forums, etc., on this site, I am ready to wipe the dust off Tick and start playing him again. Through reading posts and the like I see that there are many places that I haven't seen that I could really enjoy visiting. <br />
<br />
    If any of you good people are around my level and playing on Luclin, please give me a tell. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
