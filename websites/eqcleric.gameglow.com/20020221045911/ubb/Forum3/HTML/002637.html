</FONT><HR>Isn't anyone else ticked off over the large change in spawn times?  The post from Absor regarding the cleric changes said that subsequent spawns would be "every few days".<P>To me, 6+ days is not every few days.  That's almost a week.  Why wasn't he honest in saying that subsequent spawns will occur once a week?  Afraid to call it the nerf that it is?<P>The cleric epic went from a 1-3 day camp for Zordak in SolB... to a 1-2 day camp for Zordak in SolB + a 6+ day camp in Skyfire.<P>Sure they try to candy coat it by saying that the change was to help prevent KSing issues, which I'm all fine with that.. but notice how they didn't admit to the fact that they just doubled the camp time?<P>Why hasn't anyone started a petition or been demanding some answers from those jerks?<P>Just as a side note, I'm not even a cleric and I'm upset with the change.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The only change is that now if the cleric gets ganked by another guild, there is nothing lost except time.  Before, the cleric had to go get another pearl.<P>I am still confused about why they moved him.  It is unbelieveably easy to KS him now.  I mean, they put him in a zone where druids/wizards can gate directly to.  If your server has issues with Sev, they will be even worse for Rage now.<P>/sigh<P>Galuvian Silvertone<BR>56 Bard<BR>Drinal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Yes, absolutely I'm angry about the new spawn times. I spent about two weeks solid camping Ragefire in one form or another. I've got my swirling pearl, but after spending a solid 50+ hour block of time in Skyfire only to find that he doesn't spawn the way Absor said he does, I gave up in frustration. I refuse to camp a 4-7 day random spawn, that's just rediculous.<P>------------------<BR>Ninara Silkenhand<BR>57th Level Heretic Templar of Tunare<BR>The Arcane Order</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Where do I begin?<P>I was extremely fortunate to get the first or second SOL B Ragefire pearl on Xegony. <P>The gods determined I was not to be as foruntate for the Skyfire Ragefire.<P>PRE RAGEFIRE SPAWN<P>I *enjoyed* hanging out in Skyfire off and on for several days looking for him. We formed some experience groups, had trackers looking, but no luck.<P>Of course now we know the spawn was broken and was fixed with the *silent* patch.<P>THE FIRST RAGEFIRE SPAWN--23 hours<P>1) Being prepared for a 54 dragon, only to discover Zordak is a level 60 dragon--we almost had him, but it was a wipe out. (At least 3 guides died also!) <P>2) Killing Ragefire and engaging the above level 60 dragon while having another guild petitioning against us who had exactly one person in the zone when Ragefire popped--we had 12 and Verant saying they won't get involved--we had to negotiate amoung ourselves.<P>3) In racing to complete CR and buffs, having the dragon despawn.<P>THE SECOND RAGEFIRE--111 hours<P>1) Having a GM tell me the next, the 2nd Ragefire spawn was broken, no eta on fix, probably after the next patch, after camping it for 96 hours only to discover he spawned at 111 hours.<P>2) Having another guild show up in force at 110 hours ready for that spawn. And of course this guild was never around in the first 96 hours. (This issue of guide misreprention and favortisim will become more of a major issue in the future--the guide started a new account on Xegony and joined this guild. Many players on Xegony know this, Verant refuses to acknowlege the problem simply saying this is a serious accusation but there are no facts to support it.<P>Knowing the Skyfire Rage spawns times sure would have been nice before we started our *few* day camp.  <P>THE THIRD RAGEFIRE--150 hours<P>1)Sending an email to Verant, and in-game petitions asking for a zone repop due to the lies and misrepresentations by the GM--never to have it even answered.<P>"GM at lunch, repetition in 45 mins" was the best answer--of course repetition was never answered either. <P>2) Having Verant tell me I had to again negotiate with another cleric, who didn't have the new Rage SOL B pearl, who has the rights to the spawn even though we had been camping it for 3 days and he just showed up to claim the spawn? (Fortunately the cleric's guild leader ended up honoring our camp--but only after his cleric had petitioned.)<P>3) A *few* days? What is that all about? <P>CONCLUSOIN<P>Despite all of the above crap we camped the 3rd Xegony spawn in force, we had 3 or 4 on line at all times--yes even at 4AM--and had 12 in zone at 150 hours. Within 10 mins we had 26 for an easy overkill.<P>99% of the clerics and guilds who wandered into Skyfire honored our camp and wished us well. <P>The only rude assholes in this whole thing where actually Verant guides and GMs--note not all guides, several were extremely sympathetic *off-the-record*, but as the petitions were escalted Verant made it clear they wanted nothing to do with us. <P>They refused to answer and were very curt with well reasoned, polite inquiries. My email was very reasoned, politely asking for a zone repop due to *inadverent GM misinformation," and it was simply not even answered.<P>Not like they didn't know where we were  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>In summary, most of the players did the right thing. <P>Verant's arrogance, favortism and misinformation actually exacberated the problem.<P>Redwineson<BR>Level 54 Cleric<BR>Xegony<BR>Circle of Valor<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm sure it won't get posted or answered, but I posted this on the official developer's forum:<P>Clerics, now realizing that the cleric quest involves not one, but two many, multi-day camps with extremely highly contested mobs, are not very happy with the Ragefire change.  The Sol B Ragefire seems to spawn about once every 3 days, the Skyfire ones is about once every 5 days. <P>This is just like Severilious which causes severe bad-will amongst the players on the servers because of the humoungous bottleneck of warriors needing a green scale.   I've seen more petitions and CS problems of the type of "I was here first with my group and they KS'd us" then anywhere else in the game.<P>You may have fixed the problem with someone swiping someone elses Ragefire dragon (without properly spawning it), but you've created a boiling pot of bad-will that will brew over into petitions and behavior problems from the people that have camped him only to see it stolen away after 100+ hours of waiting.  <P>Why is this considered an improvement?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I really don't think that the cleric epic is easy at all especially now with the new changes.  Before the change, I was going to grit my teeth and stay awake for 3 days for ragefire.  But now with the new change, I have to stay awake 3 days for the ragefire camp in SolB, and also another 5 days for the camp in Skyfire.  My physically body cannot handle staying awake for 5 consecutive days of camping.  Also with how badly contested the ragefire camp is, I'll be completely heart broken if after 5 days of long camp that I was not able to gather the forces together in enough time to have it a. despawn on me or b. have another guild / alliance kill it on me.  All and all, I think that Verant made a horrible change to the cleric epic.  And I really hope that it goes back to the way it used to be.<P><BR>Rosieana Deceiver<BR>54 Cleric<BR>Stormbringers<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think everything would be fine if they would have actually implimented the quest like they said they were going to:<P>1 day spawn of SolB Zordak<BR>"a few days" spawn on Skyfire Zordak 1-3 days<P>"a few days" is NOT 6+ days, that's almost a week... or several days.  <P>If they want to keep the spawn time of the Skyfire Zordak down because of this dragon loot table, then I say remove those items and just put the heart on him!  You're still going to be able to find people to come help kill him regardless of what other items he may drop.  It brings another click cleric into the world... and you never know when you might need a rez.<P>In summary:  current implimentation of the changes = BAD!<P>Quest done the way Absor stated it would be = GOOD!<P>Just typical Sony Online Entertainment BS for you.  No wonder Brad and those other guys left.  They realized that Verant guys can't program worth a ****!!  They are all a bunch of clueless programmers that couldn't write a Hello World program to save their lives!!  They MIGHT be able to make it say Hello.. but then it would take 2 weeks of patching and testing to make it say World.. and then of course it still woudn't work right because it would just print out World then without the Hello!  Which would involve another 2 weeks of testing and debugging and PR Spinning and require us to spend another $20 for an upgraded program if we really want to see the full "Hello World" message.  Damn you guys make me SICK!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Gonna play a little devil's advocate here...<P>There is one element overlooked by everyone in these changes. This change was MAJOR and GOOD.<P>Completion of our epic no longer depends upon Nagafen being dead.<P>Think back to when we had the SoL patch week. No epics could be done beacuse they would patch every day and Nagafen would be up. No more twink raids. No more frustration when GMs would have to repop the zone. No more screaming when people would crash the zone.<P>So, in essence, the changes made are not ALL bad. That and you lose nothing if you lose the Skyfire Ragefire.<P>/deviladvocate off<P>Really have no clue why Verant doesn't do what they say. The SolB step should be simple like Alan stated, not the insane camping people are doing now. And if Skyfire Rage(SR) is indeed a 6 day spawn, expect there to be a lot more irate camping clerics being run over.<P>Simple fact here is nothing about the camp has really changed. You keep a raid in Skyfire, ready to go at a moment's notice or you watch another guild run past you after days of camping. And no, having the SolB pearl does not entitle you to SR.<P>It sounds callous but it's the sad truth. The ONLY difference between Ragefire and, say, Lodizal is Ragefire is a cleric issue only. KSing mobs and camp disputes are a daily issue and the only resolution is "He who engaged first gets first crack at it".<P>Welcome back to the new old camp system...  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just gonna add my 2 cents here, <P>I'm a L60 ranger, and plan 99% of the raids, and epic takedowns for a moderately sized guild on the seventh hammer.<P>This whole issue does pose risk for us, as at least two other guilds onthe hammer re known for ganking other peoples camps.<P>BUT.. This is a lot easier than the Ranger epic, so far I have visited Hate over 40 times, killed over 200 of the mini boss's, to se no Shattered emeralds of corruptopn drop.<P>I do feel your pain, however would venture that you do not feel mine, 8 months I haveneeded just one item, and I expect I will still be looking for it in 8 months time.<P>the cleric epic however now has a way of being resolved, assuming fair play ont he part of other guilds etc.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have a 57 cleric on Dro server. I would have to agree that the cleric epic is pretty easy if you look at the mobs we have to kill.<P>We have some long camps (LOIO, SolA) to start with then Chardok and BW can go as quickly as you get guild together. The last part has just been changed to a long camp now. Or wait awhile and see what the spawn cycle turns into and then plan on having guild ready and take the mob when it spawns. <P>There are a number of ways to do this. Took me 4 days to get SolB done--sharing the camp with other clerics and I even got ganked on spawn once when another cleric walked up, zordak spawned and he beat me to the turn in. <P>Guess I am just tryin to say...life sucks sometimes...especially in EQ. But the Cleric epic is easy in my opinion and just the camps are the tedious bit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'll probably get alot of thumbs down on this one, but being on the last step of my epic for the past 6 months only needing Ragefire, it wouldn't hurt my feelings if they made it a no camp mob. If he's camped, he don't spawn. He should pop and it should be first come, first serve. With all the KS'ing it doesn't seem to matter if you've been camping him 3 or 4 days anyway. <P>We finished the King in Chardok and I was off to Sol B. Everyday I would zone in and shout "anybody camping Ragefire" and the response was always the same "yes". After about a week of that I said this is ridiculous and never looked back.<P>Come to find out some of the higher lvl guilds were camping him back to back for their clerics. <P>In my opinion this means of camping Ragefire isn't a right of passage. <P>It was the same when the first cleric quest armor came out. Clerics always fighting over the zombie in NK, camping that gnome in Befallen till we thought we would go crazy. Now at just about any given time you can find these mobs up and uncamped. Hopefully, one day soon the same will hold true with Ragefire(s).<P>------------------<BR>Caelie Nightengale<BR>55 Templar<BR>Eternal Haven </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>probably an unpopular idea, but what the heck..<P>I suggest all clerics stop doing the cleric epic<P>Get to 56, get the res in your spellbook, and move on..The ONLY saving grace of the epic is the right click power of saving you time and mana..<P>I keep seeing these amazing camp times and have no doubt in my mind now that I will never get the epic even though I have already done some of the steps.. Why? Because I will NEVER camp a rare spawn mob like that..I never have, never will..

</FONT><HR>In my opinion (what do i know, only been playing since beta) cleric epic is now the hardest, period, end discussion. The reason for this is plain and simple. In a word, competition, competition for the ragefire spawn. I have needed ragefire for the last 10 months. I only left SolB when my guild was on raids and short clerics. Ragefire was ganked from me a total of 5 times, last time Alan mentioned in his reasoning for the ragefire change. (you know its bad when Alan actually says something about it) Now with the new change it took 2 weeks (approx) to get ragefire in solB. During that time I was purposefully trained on average about 6-8 times a day to get me killed so another cleric could get that camp. In skyfire RF is perm camped by people 'claiming' it for so-and-so. End result the changes are horrible. Yes i do see your point about not having to worry about Naggy being up, but Naggy up was actually a break for me to leave SolB for a bit. I enjoyed helping the newbie raids take him down, was a nice deversion.<P>As far as the other epics mention by Higar:<BR>Wiz- phiny is a joke, have personally taken him with 2 others and we called wiz in on several occasions to loot<BR>Ranger- oh no 40 raids, that is what a month and a half? talk to me in 8 more months of hate raiding<BR>Monk- raster? gee either buy it or go kill the monks in SK or RM for the robe, nice having options.<BR>Druid- 2 hour spawn? GOD THAT WOULD BE NICE!!<BR>War- Get your VP key and get your scale there.<P>Now i am not saying ANY epic is easy, er wait a tic Monk, rogue, shamen IS easy, but regarding the others no epic is easy. Hands down now cleric IS the most difficult due to LONG camp times and the competition. 7 day spawn timer? that is just plain ignorant. VI needs to get its collective head out of its ass and do some customer service. CENSOR CENSOR POLICE "WE AT VI DO NOT TOLERATE THE USE OF CERTAIN WORDS, YOU HAVE USED THE "HOLY GRAIL" OF EVIL WORDS. NEVER AGAIN USE THE NAME VI AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN IN THE SAME SENTANCE.<P>Asytoleis<BR>60 cleric<BR>Brell<P>I pray that none of you go through what I have gone through for this epic.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I dont need an epic, it doesn't improve my performance more then about 2% and that is only if a whole lot of people get dead. <P>My guild wants clerics that have epics because it lets them do more things and CR faster on blow outs.   <P>If I get lucky perhaps I'll get a rage fire in SF, but with 2 epics a week max? I doubt it.  Why? because guilds with 80 level 60 folks that have 0 lives.   <P>Why is this? Well mostly because level 50+ clerics can get 56 ress faster and be usefull.  Most of these clerics are twinks of uber guilds or kids that dont want a life and think EQ is one.   <P>The whole cleric epic is a shame, and I'm supprised Verant hasn't figured out that by just putting a 56+ level restriction on this item they would solve many of thier support issues.   My favorite was seeing the level 51 cleric that left my guild for an uber have no life guild, and get his epic in a week.   Still level 51, just to have him quit playing and Ebay 2 weeks later.  Hey only got $1200 for his account. <P>It is an epic I will probably not have, on the other hand raster for my monk took about 4 hours, the whole epic quest up to the pipes has taken about 40 hours on and off.   I just need the final battle in LoIO.  Not a challenge, no line to wait in, and he repops in 3 hours. <P>Monks actually benefit from thier epic.  40% better monk combat.  <P>ALL Epic's should have a level restriction, and Ragefire should be a 3 hour respawn.<P>I am happy for all those clerics that get thier epics.  I just can't see sitting in a camp more then 12 hours max.  Its just not a good RL choice. <P>As for burning 3 vacation days to do my epic in a GAME? Thats just silly.<P>Everquest = Evercamp = Everbored = Neverwinternights soon. <P>Damn how many games do you know build a game inside thier game to keep you from falling asleep? Gems anyone?<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Kanbyen (edited 02-13-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>*I was the Quellious Cleric that had Rage Poof*<P>...but I just want to send a warning out that he didn't despawn.  He was chased into the OT corridor and got stuck, thus dropping him under the world map due to world geography and once that happened he poofed.  The dragon for is apparently on a 2 hour timer but he hadn't been up that long yet.  I petitioned but convienently the GM was off that day from work.  I tried for the next week to get the spawn, waited through both server patches and gave up after I couldn't stand to be in there any longer.<P>I will say Kudos to Duffe and his group there.  Jeannie and I were both there wanting Rage and we decided just to roll for the heart, (I won  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"> ) and both forces would help kill the dragon for the winning cleric.  It was really nice to not have to fight over it. Too bad VI wouldn't do the right thing and repop him...<P>I am hoping that more clerics/guilds will follow the example and be willing to work together for the camp and help bring each new epic in with good tidings and thoughfulness for their fellow clerics.  <P>I just want to say this with the hope that we will all be considerate of each other! *crosses fingers*<P>*Please, clerics that don't have their epics completed up to the Ragefire portion, let the Clerics that have worked their butts off to be ready for rage be allowed to complete the quest!  Don't let a heart container sit in a bank...let it be ready to combine with the pearl so that one more epic can come onto your server!*<P>Thanks<BR>Darkalyn D'Kujaku<BR>Alliance of the Arcane<P><BR>  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The biggest problem with the timers on Ragefire is that there is a loooong line of clerics waiting on their epics, and more clerics entering the game than there are epics acquired on a single day.  One should not need an uber guild or an vacation week in order to acquire something.  What does Verant gain by not allowing clerics to get the rez-stick???  Nothing at all.  Why don't mobs with rare loot always drop it, or always spawn???  I just can't figure them out sometimes, I really can't.  I'm considering quitting EQ, have been for quite some time, even before I started playing a cleric.  I mean, who DOESN'T get shafted on their epics?  In some form or fashion, everyone does.  Why is it that Verant/Sony is the only corp. that can piss of their customers and get away with it?  It simply makes no sense to me.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well I think they screwed up beyond repair on this new change of theirs and then for Verant to claim that they consider it "Fair" is just insane.  How can you call something Fair when a guild can sit in SF for a week day after day and suddenly be KSd within 10 minutes by another guild?<P>They made this epic more difficult to complete by the sheer force of KSing already seen on numerous servers.  Atleast the old way you could camp your guild in Sol B and block yourself in with FireGiants thus preventing a possible KS.<P>So the term "Fairness" and the idea of "Honor Among Guilds" has simply faded away on EQ where the cleric epic is concerned.  <P>~Cartina Darkdeeds,<BR>56th Cleric, Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It really has turned into bs.  I finaly got solb rage after 120 hours but I refuse to camp skyfire.<P>The way I look at it...i am better off getting my wisdom to 250 and getting all of my aa stuff.  This will be easier and it wont require weeks of camping.  With a chanter and necro present on raids I will we able to rezz just as fast.<P>I dont see why they want to limit the number of epics entering the game.  It simply is not that powerful of an epic.  I also think if you have done the work you should get your epic.  Sitting on your butt and losing your job and your family etc.etc.etc.  is just not worth it imo.<P>*shrug* I'm out of the way  someone else can take my spot in skyfire.<P>Aanare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002637&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002637&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
