<br />
Complete and utter bufoons? How can a collection of people be so insanely stupid!<br />
<br />
I got a reply on WhinePlay myself from Abashi months ago when only the live version was spawning with the everpresent &quot;it works just great, you run along now and get back into our world&quot;. Next patch happens and the dead version is the one that is spawning.<br />
<br />
Hrmm, okay, it wasn't broke but for some reason we decided to change some code so that it's different. When did quests start being dymanic? Are they supposed to be different from one patch to the next? Yes? Fine! That would add some more challenge to the game. But this is getting just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
We got the attention of Ester the other day and she said that live will spawn but there's a trick.<br />
Patch.<br />
Different spawn rules.<br />
WTF?!?<br />
<br />
Make up your GD minds!<br />
<br />
If you say it's not broke - LEAVE IT! If you fix something have the decency to admit to us that it needed fixing.<br />
Grimrot = Poison = Alchemy = Tinkering = Lots of VI BS<br />
<br />
If you change it after saying it was fine you look like complete MORONS! If I choose to sit in front of this stupid camp for hours, fine, I've obviously got some time to waste, but this is really pissing me off. This game is starting to resemble politics, lie out your ass while someone tries to fix what you *#$%*! up. &quot;We did not have sexual relations&quot;, &quot;I did not inhale&quot;, &quot;Grimrot is not broken&quot;.<br />

Hmmm...could that be the &quot;trick&quot; to which Ester refers?<br />
