<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimette</div><div class="date">01-23-2000, 06:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because we play at odd hours (US Time), my 30th monk partner and I have recently found ourselves camping the ancient crocodile in Guk - I know this isn't exactly the easiest thing to get into. The first time we got in, the Ancient turned up as #3 (Legs), #4 (Arms) and #8 (Legs - went to a druid that was helping us)- since then noshow<br />
<br />
Anyway, tonight, the Ancient refused to spawn, so we have just spent 7 hours killing placeholders with a passing mage.<br />
<br />
About 2 hours in, I looked at my XP bar to find I have gained a solid bubble - after 7 hours 3 bubbles of XP, and all but into 33. Clem (the monk) has a bubble and a bit of 30th level. And every placeholder has been Blue to me, and Blue/White to Clem.<br />
<br />
We find ourselves hoping for the spawn of 5 x placeholders, rather then the Ancient. The next Ancient spawn is going to someone, on a we-get-xp-you-get-the-loot deal.<br />
<br />
So, with memories of Oasis coming back, are there other monsters with no-loot and lots of XP ? Or is this some paticular thing that happens with the Crocodile monster type alone  ?<br />

For some reason, they have begun spawning in Oasis, i really don't know why, but i see lots and lots of red guys to me (lvl 27) fighting these freaking dogs!! The dogs are all blue to me, and from 21-25 I fought them at Rathe mountain zone in Lake rathe.  The highest i saw in lake was lvl 34 magi soloing them, could only take like one in 5, so we got the rest.  No loot what so ever since they are summoned, BUT they are summoned, which means Mages can use the handy ward summoned line.  Clerics get that spell too, but at lvl 29 we are only at the second part.  But still they are awesome exp, and in lake rathe there is a bandit camp near, you can clear that and get a few bronze weapons and bandit sashses, which turn in at qeynos for bronze weapons and 1-2pp in cash, plus faction. They make up for the no loot dogs.</div></div><hr />
