<br />
The other night we tried Ail the Elder. Basically we had the clerics at max range with the casters behind them to dispell silence. Unfortuneatly some brilliant necro threw around cold resist on incoming and filled our empty first buff slot.<br />
<br />
Anyone got suggestions on mobs that silence? I'm thinking of trying to go buffless next time. I got aggrod because I was chain casting remedy because it took so long to get silence striped off. If I could have used my other/bigger/better heals I think I could have avoided aggro all together.<br />
<br />
Another problem I have with dispell is that it seems a bit random, there is no guarantee that it will strip what is in the first slot.<br />
<br />
Anyone got input?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samsara</div><div class="date">03-27-2001, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...or go buffless and group with a bard singing the level 22 group-debuffing song non-stop.  I don't know for certain but it seems like silence would cause a bard to be unable to twist in a new song, but it wouldn't stop one already running.  So even if you got silenced, on the next pulse of the song it would get canceled.<br />
<br />
Would that work?  And even if so, would it be just a pain in the neck to have to completely unbuff and then rebuff afterwards?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">03-29-2001, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's exactly what is sounds like. :P  When a mob casts the silence spell, if you don't resist it, you can't cast spells or activate any clickable spell effects (oh and I &quot;think&quot; weapons won't proc either).  Xylgoz in VP does it, atleast 1 dragon in Western Wastes does it (can't remember the name, but boy wasn't that a surprise), more then 1 mob in PoG does it (the ultimate being Tunare I believe).  Xylgoz and the dragon in WW silence is resistable with high MR, not sure a about the others as I haven't been there.  Also, the 2 dragons silence isn't a terribly long duration, again, not sure of the others.<br />

<br />
Yes, bards are not an option for my raids. So I guess we'll have to try charisma buff cures. That is much more preferable as cancel magic spells tend to strip spell effects predominantly based on power, lowest first.<br />
<br />
So I guess we'll have to assign a shaman/chanter to each cleric to stand back and charisma cure. Does any charisma work, or only high level ones? We'll have to find the most effecient or fastest cast one.<br />
<br />
**EDIT<br />
<br />
Ok, I just checked a spells database and every charisma takes 5secs to cast. So if the level 14/20 ones are sufficient we should go with those.<br />
<br />
Krilian: Will silence overwrite a charisma buff and vice-versa? Or is it just a one shot cure and you will need annul on the next wave?<br />

Big Gay Al, and Tunare.  The PoG silance lasts for 10 minutes.  We got Ail to about 30% life once using all the clerics in a bard group but it was late and too many people had logged.<br />
<br />
There are at least 5 different Dragons in Western Wastes that use Xygoz's Silance, 2 Warders in sleepers, and I'm sure we will find a lot more.  I can't tell you how frustration it can be for a cleric, even when your in a bard group with MR close to 400 it can be painful.</div></div><hr />
