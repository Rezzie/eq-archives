<br />
I doubt all druids think that Complete Heal and Manaburn is the way to 'balance' the druid class post-50, but the ones there that do ... I don't think they'll listen to any cleric's perspective (remember the 'petition'?), no matter how reasonably worded it is.  <br />
<br />
Even something as simple as &quot;If you want to heal well, level up a cleric, not a druid&quot;  is likely to be derided.   More's the pity.<br />

<br />
That being said, I personally don't have a huge problem with giving them a gimped CHeal, say 600 mana 15 seconds, provided:<br />
<br />
-&gt; Clerics get invis.<br />
-&gt; Runspeed/levitation buff (Wings of an Angel, I want people asking me for the Angel buff =P)<br />
-&gt; Either better dots/nukes or significantly better melee capability.  I want to solo efficiently as a Cleric.  And I seriously doubt that the best equipped Cleric around could touch your average 60 melee with decent AA when it comes to churning low blues.<br />
<br />
You add to the list.  As it is, I thought you hit things on the head Islington.  There are places I go in CT that actually require a Cleric.  The most efficient of those, of course, require the Cleric the least (typically one Cheal per fight).  <br />
<br />
Many people just don't seem to understand that efficiency of levelling = churning mobs, not surviving difficult fights.  There are other places where I can solo/duo and get very nice experience and require 1 CHeal (on my SK) every 3rd/4th fight.  And he's still not particularly well outfitted, although he's turned over 75% of his gear since my return.  I watch &quot;ubers&quot; solo near me and it's still not close.  Of course your average level 4x-5x Druid won't have a clue what a melee in NToV+ gear with a buttload of AA can do to low blues.<br />
<br />
As for giving away the farm, I honestly sympathize with how many Druids feel, especially when it comes to raids.  However, that's because I play an SK in addition to the Cleric, and the SK is in many ways in the same boat.  When the big bad ass comes up, the SK need not apply.  He's not a legitimate alternative to a Warrior with defensive.  And it's rather frustrating.  So I'm generally not in favor of the monopolies in the game.<br />
<br />
I don't know the answer to their (Druids') problems, but I do think they are real.  The high end game is rather badly skewed towards certain classes and has been for quite some time.  They fixed the Ranger class while I was gone, I don't see why they can't address other issues.<br />

I sort of wonder if VI has decided to go with the Games Workshop marketing scheme.  Lets make one group AWESOME and the rest suck.  Then we will fix the problem.  Next the make a new group AWESOME so we start up a new character.  <br />

Maybe VI is secretly terrified that we will all decide the game is played out and jump to The New Zoo Review massively multiplayer RPG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice to see that you are being somewhat rational about this. <br />
<br />
As to what clerics need, I think we can see that it is already being addressed by VI. <br />
<br />
The problem with (higher end) clerics is that due to the XP system in EQ you want to (as you said) churn mobs. In particular as low blue mobs as possible. When high level tanks do this they do not need significant healing. <br />
<br />
The way to fix this is to reward players for attacking higher con mobs. Vi does not want to restructure the XP/MOB system (although that is a fine way to solve it if you ask me). So instead in new zones like Cazic, the ZEM is insane and the MOBs are all 50+. This makes healing necessary even for high level tanks. And when I say healing, I mean efficient healing. <br />
<br />
I am quite sure that all high level zones in PoP will be structured in the same manner as CZ. It looks like the dude who is running the balance show at VI understands what's what.<br />
<br />
So you needn't worry too much. Clerics will be still be needed if druids gets a bad version of CH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- 400 mana<br />

- heals 66% * (Max Hp - Current Hp)<br />
<br />
So, 66% as many HP healed per cast compared to CH - it just never heals to full. That way druids can drool all over theoretical &quot;CHs&quot; on a 7khp tank - as you also see in their thread.<br />
<br />
What clerics need as compensation is a different matter entirely - and its neither invis nor sow imho - because those are pretty worthless in my book.<br />

<br />
Only thing clerics need is a way to increase dps during grinding. I'm not sure how being stunned affects mitigation (ie how much damage the stunned party takes)... if it does significantly, they could just add some sort of 'paralyze/hold person' spell for clerics, capped at lvl 50 for targets. Would stun the target for up to 15sec for 150 mana. This would make a 3 monk group really love having a cleric, which is essentially the problem at with clerics and grinding... melee heavy well equipped group does NOTHING with a cleric.<br />
<br />
If the stun doesn't affect mitigation/avoidance, they could always kludge in a -150ac debuff in that stun. That way you'd get those that shun clerics to actually like us again =p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All they need to do is scale exp from mobs with the relative difficulty of the encounter properly.<br />
<br />
If they did this then doing difficult things would be advantageous.<br />
<br />
If for example fighting something for 1 minute with a full group against something that quads for 300 or something gave 10x the experience of what a monk can get fighting for a minute against a blue conn mob then it would be worthwhile.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to do this might be to give mobs exp based on the amount of damage they can put out multiplied by the number of hps they have.<br />
<br />
A mob with 1k hps and hits for 200, should get 1/10th the exp of a mob with 10k and hits for 200 because it should take a group 10x longer to kill the second mob.<br />
<br />
Likewise a mob with 1k hps and hits for 400 should get 2x the exp because it has the potencial to do 2x the damage.<br />
<br />
This would also even things up against AE groups.<br />
<br />
If one group could do something 10-20x more difficult than a normal mob in an ae group in the same amount of time then they will be getting close to the exp.<br />
<br />
It would also open things up alot - people would go to a vast range of different places for exp.<br />
<br />
Single ssra groups should get some of the best exp in the game, if you single group an ancient sentry then you should get alot of exp for the effort of killing a mob with what 90k hps and quads/flurries for 300+.  <br />
<br />
At present killing difficult critters means more downtime, more risk of dying but also a substancially longer fight.  Overall you get about the same exp per kill as well so overall you get shafted for exp.<br />
<br />
Even in CT there is no reward for doing more difficult critters there - its all about zone bonus, not critter bonus.  You can get as good exp doing the zone as deeper in.<br />
<br />
Fix this and clerics don't need altering at all.  Melees with primals/ntov or better gear would seek us out to do things where risk vs reward was 'working as intended'</div></div><hr />

That heal could work too.  66% of 7K still comes to 4,666.  <br />
<br />
As for compensation add your own then ideas then, I picked things that bug me.  Having to run my Cleric around bugs me.  Oh, I'd like a better heal, say 2500 HP, 5 sec cast, pick your mana cost, but that won't affect the majority of bitching I read about on this site.<br />

Gosh, I hate clerics. I just have to figure out who is worse, clerics of necromancers of 1999 .... it's a tough call. <br />
<br />
The problem here is that, as always, everyone seems to think clerics are a bunch of greedy SOBs who want to be essential in every aspect of EQ. Paladins thought this once and now we have druids thinking it. Then again, most people think of druids as quad kiting SOBs who could care less who they drag their mobs over and now want to have their jack-of-all-trades cake and eat it too.<br />
<br />
Druids honestly have no idea what the plight of the cleric class is. Didn't read a single post over there that even suggested some improvements. It's almost like the Israeli-Palestinian standoff &quot;We'll talk when they do this&quot; &quot;Well, we'll only talk if they do this&quot; &quot;We'll do that after they've done what we aked&quot; &quot;We can't do what they asked for until they do what we asked for&quot; ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
I made my suggestion and it was ignored. It was a good suggestion too. Apparently druids will only be satisfied once they get CH.<br />
<br />
Some gems from this thread...<br />
 &quot;I cannot solo. I cannot do damage. I cannot port. Hell, I can't even get exp groups these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
I call bull****. Unless you are a very very bad player behind that cleric's screen, this is not true. <br />
Peppin Bramblefist<br />
Hierophant of Tarew Marr<br />
 The clerics being the greedy sons of ... grrr ... must control self ... will flame the crap out of any suggestion that anyone should get anything like effective healing, but we'll see what happens when the VI guys finish the priest balancing. <br />
<br />
 You know it. I have said this for a long time. Boohoo the clerics say I can do nothing but heal. Bulls***. Root, fear, stun, reverse damage shields, buffs, REZ (for god's sake, even IF they did not have a stranglehold on it which they do it would be an amazing ability), some DD, good undead DD, undead DOts, HoT spells, ITU, Divine Aura line, Atone series, AE spells, my god. <br />
<br />
 5. Scir, umm, our average CH on a tank is in the 2 to 3k area so that would put your DD heal in the area of 1.5 to 2k heal and you can get that with crit heal today...<br />
<br />
Only if you're incompetent...or nervous. If the MT is only down a third to one half of his HPs when your average CH hits, then you're wasting mana. A lot of mana. <br />
<br />
This isn't a flame, I just want the attitude of &quot;OMG Clerics are overpowered in every aspect&quot; attitude to stop. If you don't know why the above quotes are wrong (and this is just a small sample from the first 3 pages) then I suggest you take the time to find out why...<br />

<br />
That being said, guess which one of my toons is retired? That's right - the druid. If I wanted to solo everyday of my life I'd be playing Morrowind, not EQ. Hence, I have to play my cleric to actually get invited to raids.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I have a blast regardless of which one I'm playing. I would love to be able to solo on the cleric just like I'd love to get to raid on the druid.<br />
<br />
Instead of this crap of clerics saying the druids are naive and the druids saying the clerics are naive, how 'bout we all just realize both classes need tuning, just in different directions. Clerics need their solo power upped and druids need their raid power upped.</div></div><hr />

(a HoT of sorts in my opinion would be more in line with the type of healing we usually do.)<br />

400 mana for a 880hp heal just doesnt cut it anymore(never did heh), neither on raids, or in groups - simply runs us oom too fast.</div></div><hr />

   I'm not sure how welcome I am here, as I dont post to class boards much, but I just thought I would chime in and say that I agree with Kahlia 100%.  I know it looks stupid to ask for CH and Manaburn, but its just because Druids are frustrated because we dont have a defined role in the High end game.  Personally, I dont think we should get CH or Manaburn, that would be way overpowering.  I do think we need better heals though.  Anyway Kahlia's post hit the nail right on the head, both classes need some tuning.<br />

Most druids don't want CH or Manaburn.  They want a bigger heal in the 2k area.  Mainly they just want a role in raids other than spamming really small heals on the non main tanks and running OOM because of the horrible inefficiency.<br />
<br />
I agree that clerics have their short comings too.  I think that if druids get a buff to their healing abilities that clerics should get a buff to their soloing/exping abilities.<br />

<br />
From what I managed to read, I can only say this to the oringial poster:  Are you that f'ing clueless??<br />
<br />
I noticed that in first two paragraphs, the poster made references to &quot;uber guilds&quot; not just guilds in general.  Who wants to take bets that the poster tried to get into a big guild on his/her server and was turned down because they already had way too many druids, and now he/she is just bitter about it?  <br />
<br />
You want to know why big guilds only want a certain number of druids? It's because there's too many of them per server.  Why? Because the class is WAY overpowered and extremely easy to play levels 1-50...once a druid gets SoW at 14 and begins kiting, they can set the cruise control and just let the xp roll in.  People choose to play druids in droves. A druid doesn't need a group in the pre-50 game...and, to be honest, they're not designed for them.  There's very little risk in playing a druid, and lots of rewards.  That's why druids are so popular and numerous...and that's why it *appears* that big guilds only need a certain number of druids.  A guild that says &quot;we only need 10 clerics&quot; isn't nearly as disheartening as one that says &quot;we only need 10 druids.&quot; Same number of each class needed, except that the pool to choose a druid from is about 20 times the size of the pool from which to choose a cleric.  Those same druids who whine that no guild will take them or that they have no use in the 50+ game are the SAME people who said I don't want to play a cleric because *insert whining complaint here*.  They want their cake AND be able to eat it too AND still have some leftover for later.<br />
<br />
From the thread:<br />
 Have we all become so quiet and meak after years of Druid Hating posts and Druid Nerfs that we are afraid to stand up for ourselves.<br />
<br />
Maybe the reason we all sound like whiners is that we have been asking for things for so long without anything being given.<br />
<br />
Yes, you have been whining and complaining since I started playing more than 2 years ago.  Yes, it's gotten old because you're not asking to improve YOUR class, you're asking to TAKE THINGS AWAY from other classes and make those classes obsolete.  You want everything, but are willing to give up nothing in return.<br />
<br />
I try...I *really* try to understand druids and their &quot;me, me, me&quot; attitude, but posts like that just make them seem like even bigger jackasses than they already are. I even started a druid back when some druid told me to walk a mile in their shoes.  It's easy to get addicted to such a versatile and easy to play class.  It's easy to develop that I'm-better-than-everyone attitude because in the early parts of the game, they are better than everyone else.  It's easy to wander down that path and forget any other characters you've played and how classes depend on each other. It's easy to become an a$$hole.  But, I chose not to be like that...my cleric is my main...always has been and always will be.  Sure, I'd like to have invisibility and a few other utility spells, but I'll gladly do without them if it means retaining my integrity.</div></div><hr />

Try walking a mile in the cleric shoes. Playing a made 60 character occasionally is a trip to the mailbox.<br />
<br />
Boost to soloing abilities doesnt do it for a cleric.  Right now, xp groups (in HS, Seb, Chardok, Karnors, The Grey, FG) really dont need a cleric.  A druid will do.  <br />
<br />
But we are going over and over the same ground and repeating the same arguments.  Look up earlier threads to see how they ended.<br />

The quotes by the druids are no more inaccurate than your own posts. Speaking as one of the people who has a 60 druid and a 60 cleric and has played both in the end game, I tend to see the argument from both sides.<br />
<br />
I have a druid as well. I also have many druid friends who are not mindless quad kiters and find &quot;dr00dz&quot; to be a minority. But where am I inaccurate? My proposal went largely ignored and all of those quotes are from that thread. I don't find it to be a misrepresentation of anything.<br />
<br />
 That being said, guess which one of my toons is retired? That's right - the druid. If I wanted to solo everyday of my life I'd be playing Morrowind, not EQ. Hence, I have to play my cleric to actually get invited to raids.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I have a blast regardless of which one I'm playing. I would love to be able to solo on the cleric just like I'd love to get to raid on the druid.<br />
<br />
Instead of this crap of clerics saying the druids are naive and the druids saying the clerics are naive, how 'bout we all just realize both classes need tuning, just in different directions. Clerics need their solo power upped and druids need their raid power upped.<br />
<br />
I do recognize that healing in general needs tuning, not just druids. But let's be honest, if druids get CH they will, effectively, be clerics. And as long as druids keep saying we're trying to keep the monopoly on &quot;healing&quot; we're not going anywhere. We are the best healers. CH makes it that way. Druids are not the best healers and that should remain.<br />
<br />
Druids need to push have healing in general fixed instead of spamming &quot;Give us CH!&quot; and &quot;Clerics are greedy!&quot;. I still don't see where my proposal fails to address any of the outstanding issues with healing. My only conclusion can be that druids will not be satisfied with anything less than CH.<br />
<br />
 My original proposal:<br />
Here's how I suggest we resolve this...<br />
<br />
New Cleric Heal<br />
Level 55<br />
2000 HP for 500 mana (4:1)<br />
5.0 sec cast<br />
Instant Recast<br />
<br />
NT would move to 57 for druids and Shamen would get it at 60 (don't know ANY Shamen who want to be primary healers). 10% penalty would go away post 50.<br />
<br />
New Druid Heal<br />
Level 60<br />
2000 HP for 670 mana (~3:1)<br />
7.0 sec cast<br />
3 sec recast<br />
<br />
Without the 10% penalty and Healing Adept 3 (something most druids have already) that's 2200 HP. A critical on that moves you to 4400. The average CH heals 3-4k, even in raids.<br />
<br />
This solves several problems. It gives clerics a reason to invest in Healing Arch skills. It fills in an admittedly large gap in healing and potentially gives druids a near-CH with HA3 and HG3 but doesn't make them equals or overpowered.<br />
<br />
This is a pretty reasonable suggestion and is one I think VI would accept.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind the average CH is in the 2-4k range...<br />

<br />
Not necessarily.  It's possible that your view is no better than an e-bay cleric or one that's been two-boxed/powerleveled.  It might be no better than my boyfriend's understanding of my cleric, or my understanding of his druid.<br />
<br />
I even doubt sometimes that I can fully appreciate a cleric's view, despite my cleric being born 3 weeks after EQ's retail release, and having developed my cleric like any main.  Because my main is really a ranger.<br />
<br />
I do know how hard it is to develop a cleric when most of your life, you're passed over in favor of healers who can SoW.  Or get into groups and die miserably trying to keep alive an incompetent tank (and having a ranger main, I know what a tank's responsibilities are - learning to taunt is a good starting point.)  I know how hard it is to have the spell costs of any other casting class, and the armor needs of any tank class, plus the reagent costs that no one else has until much later in life (and more easily affordable).<br />
<br />
Thank goodness for my druid and shamen friends who helped me get through that.<br />
<br />
Just for the record, I was always in favor of druids getting SH, thought the level (54 at the time) was much too high, and I'm in favor of them getting CH now, provided that clerics be given alternatives to being raid support.  I'm just not entirely certain that's not my ranger talking, though.<br />

On an amusing note, at eqdruids there is a thread in which many are arguing that they CAN INDEED heal sufficiently for xp grouping these days, which to me, supports the fact that when I'm LFG I'm shouting for hours unless I bite the bullet and make my own group.<br />

<br />
With all due respect Rayne, I really thing this is a bad idea. Getting invis and few other utilities in return is hardly going to cut it. There is nothing short of giving cleric all the druid utilities, offensive and defensive abilities, ports, and etc, that would make it balanced for giving druids cleric biggest strength. In that case, why bother? Why not just delete both classes and make one instead. Some names thrown around in jest in the last thread on this topic were Dleric and Cluid.<br />
<br />
Increasing mana and duration on such CH spell would not lessen the impact it would make on cleric class. It would pretty much destroy it. I honestly hope you all here can see that. Fat good is invis going to do a cleric if the class is obsolete. Might as well start a druid and get all the bells and whistles.</div></div><hr />

I could see maybe something more along the lines of Remedy or Divine Light but without CH and Rez on raids ( I stress RAIDS) what use would we actually have ? I can't evac the group when things have gone bad, I can port quickly to quad kite wherever I want ... druids are very balanced. I am sure a majority of the druid class thinks so as well and tire of hearing the word &quot;balancing&quot; all the time .. I know I do.<br />
I play both a 50+ cleric and warrior and have never felt the desire to start a druid but my ex played one solo all the way. How I would have loved to just log on for an hour and solo instead of waiting for an exp group to gain the same exp in 5 hours. <br />
If people would stop whining about their class and start one they can not bitch about this whole subject would just go away. If you want to be a healer make a cleric... it's getting to the point where they will be obsolete in 6 months anyway, so why bother ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daryaen</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read all the posts on the Druid's Grove topic and i agree Druid's need something to make them more raid friendly, however, CH and Manaburn is as rediculous as us asking for KEI and Dire Charm.<br />
<br />
Most people who have never played a high end cleric ( as in High Priest, AoW, Emperor, VT raids)don't understand the pressure and stress clerics go through being the best healers.  Druid's saying we are greedy sob's who just want to be wanted for everything is completely ignorant of how alot of us feel.  <br />
<br />
The other post on why clerics leave guilds/EQ explains how burdened we are with our superior healing abilities. My guild is currently in VT and iv'e started playing my 55 wizard more just because the responsibility/stress of being a primary healer in a zone as hard is VT is overwhelming.  Chealing a tank in VT against some of those mobs is extremely hard and stressful, i Cheal our primary tank ( in the 7500 hp range buffed) before he's even hit and if i start the CH and he starts getting pounded the second after i start CH, the heal often times isn't fast enough ( so you can see how hard stuff hits there). Having a druid/shaman there to toss Nature's touch or Chloroplast on him allows us to get CH off. That's a very important healing role imo.<br />
<br />
Obviously that kinda back up healing isn't always needed but don't say druid's are completely useless when it comes to being healers.<br />
<br />
Personally i think druids should get like a 400 mana 1200 hp heal with a 5 sec cast time and 6 sec recast and a spell like &quot;Elixir of the Forest ( or Garden)&quot; ( group Celestial elixir spell for 600 mana, healing 2k hp in 24 seconds with 5 sec recast).  That way druids have a fairly decent direct heal, as well as an extremely good &quot;regen&quot; group spell ( following in the druid's group regen tradition) without vastly over powering them. <br />

I didn't PL her up because this was her first character and I wanted her to learn how to play and actually enjoy the journey.  I made a bard that I duo'ed with her for a while till she could group with my druid.  During this time when she couldn't play I would play her as well.

So no, I have never played a full time cleric.  However I have a good deal of experience playing a cleric.  I would love to see some more solo/duo/exp grouping abilities for her.

As it stands even if clerics got more versatility and skills they wouldn't be able to use them because they are the only ones who can heal.

Of course if we wanted to do that we would all be playing PacMan.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a 2k heal both for clerics (lvl 60 for 375 mana) and druids (lvl 60 for 500 mana +recast).   Clerics have asked for a DL upgrade for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Some of the arguements were rather silly.  No one hands you a pony when you create your cleric, nor sow potions, fungi glands, faithstones...  Those must be won or bought and you have to compete with everyone else to earn them.  Its like the discussions on other boards about items making the class or race *cough*JBB*cough*.  No one just gives you something the minute you ding and become capable to use it.  No one is forcing you to play this class or that class or race or zone.  If you dont enjoy it, log off.<br />
<br />
My first char, a warrior, leveled up to 50 with only a shaman as a healer.  It is possible and workable, you just have to know what your doing, know your limitations and work within that.  I think thats the same for all the classes.<br />
<br />
AA exp rarely needs a cleric, as we have all hashed over many times.  Heck it rarely needs anything more then damage dealers no matter what class that may be.<br />
<br />
As to raiding clerics, well I hate having to sit and watch my group die while I mindlessly hit my CH key when my name is called like the trained chimp I have been reduced to.  Thankfully I normaly group with my honey the ubershaman and he can usually keep the whole group up with torpor as well as debuffing, slowing, nuking, dot'ing, buffing and looking so cute in a kilt.  But I wouldnt know as my face is in the wall while I watch the chat fly across my screen looking for my cue to CH.  Oh yes, something to aspire to.  *snicker*<br />

Somewhat off topic here, but I have to ask.  Cali, do you actually imagine that just because a druid and a shaman have the same healing spells for 59 levels that they are equivalent as healers?  <br />
<br />
A shaman gets his regeneration spells ten levels earlier, gets very nice mana regeneration capability starting at level 24, has the ability to mitigate large amounts of damage through the use of slows, can significantly increase melee damage output through haste, and at the levels you're talking about can even tank for short periods of time.  A druid can make up for the mediocrity of non-cleric heals by nuking and damage shielding.  Do you feel those are equivalent?<br />
<br />
&quot;Only a shaman&quot; has a very strange sound in my ears.<br />

How many Clerics have level 60 druids that were once their mains?<br />
<br />
By the same token, how many Druids have level 60 clerics that were their mains?<br />
<br />
<br />
I once suggested letting every healing class cast all the spells of the other healing classes, at double the mana cost, or even tripple. Can you see a druid using CH at 800-1200 mana a shot? How about a cleric TRYING to kite for double-tripple mana costs?<br />
<br />
<br />
Or the best possible solution to cleric solo power, which druids and shamans would be unable to complain about: Make heals hurt undead mobs, excluding Celstial elixer (be too powerful a DOT) and complete heal (would be WAY overpowered.)<br />

<br />
Look at most raids and the CH rotations.  When do you try to hit your CH?  Probably when the tank has 1 bub health left. Add a half a bub to that and thats what a 66% heal would do.  That is SOOOO close to CH as is its not even funny.<br />
<br />
Healing 5000 hp warrior<br />
4000 HP healed casted at 1 bub health left (cleric)<br />
3350 HP healed casted at 1.65 bub health left (druid)<br />
<br />
That means druids can replace clerics at raids no problem, but clerics still cant solo worth beans.<br />
<br />
Druids can already heal that with crits but thats only 30% of the time with all AA's needed.  So, druids can presently heal for:<br />
<br />
1956 hp -crit heal on natures touch, 30% of the time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Druids received a healing upgrade some time ago after a chorus of complaints which are now being recycled.  The excellent point made back then by we clerics was that there were too many druids, not that druids were underpowered.  Druids wouldn't STILL be grabbing for better healing if it weren't true.  They received an upgrade and they aren't getting into raids any more than they were (of course, they would claim that this is because they weren't given complete heal).<br />
<br />
Druids are missing the point. They think there is room on raids for each and every one of the zillion druids if only they had CH and/or manaburn.  But no, there won't be room if you have CH and manaburn, there are too many druids, just deal with it.  <br />
<br />
(What's different with this latest petition is that wizards are under fire too because druids now see manaburn as equivalent to CH for raid desirability.  Druids, as I mentioned, do not seem to grasp that it is overpopulation, not power, that excludes them.  Druids have a lot of power.)<br />
<br />
Give druids CH or manaburn and every top-end mob in the game will drop like wheat to the scythe because it's a lot easier to gather together fifty druids than fifty wizards or fifty clerics.  Will ANY other class be required for anything once druids can CH and manaburn?  Maybe one warrior to stand in the way for one or possibly two rounds.  <br />
<br />
Imagine the CH line with 30 druids in it, or 50.  Will any player ever again face death on a raid, should they be lucky enough to get a spot, with 100 druids lined up like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir?<br />
<br />
Druids can already do almost anything yadayadayada, how many times do we have to point out that versatility has a price?  Druids rocket to 60 while clerics inch along, and how many times do we have to point out that easy play has a price?<br />
<br />
Everyone, druids and clerics alike, seem to be going about solving this so-called &quot;druid raid problem&quot; with a minimum of imagination.  Druids are extremely versatile, and whatever &quot;balancing&quot; (the most numerous and versatile class in the game) requires should address that strength, not weaken or make obsolete or steal from, other classes.<br />
<br />
I do want to make the point that if druids were so pathetic a class as they claim, there wouldn't be so many of them cluttering up the high end game screeching about the clerics being greedy (of all things for DRUIDS to accuse clerics of!!) because we won't go quietly into extinction by giving up CH.<br />
<br />
The one thing I did painfully realize the last time the druids started grabbing at the cleric spell list was that the druids never read or responded to cleric objections with anything even remotely like objectivity.  I don't expect them to behave differently today.</div></div><hr />

I dont know if you read / post here on a daily basis like I do, but my position on Shaman has NEVER been secret.  I have always said Shaman are GODS.  I know as much if not more then 50% of the shaman out there and my shaman is only 25.  (Probably due to my fiancee being an UberShaman and as we are geeks we talk about EQ alot, lol.)<br />
<br />
As I stated the message was amusing to me as they claimed that &quot;Priests&quot; needed to be more in line.  Well, I wonder.. WHY? With shaman being the undisputed gods of Slow, Debuff, Buffing and canni dancing.  With Clerics being the undisputed healers and rezers.  With Druids being the undisputed jack of all trades priest with nukes, dot's, snare, sow, buffs, heals, regen and ports.<br />
<br />
I do not think you can even begin to COMPARE the 3 priests to eachother.  Let alone wish to take them all and make them equal or comprable.  Thats just silly.  If we did that we would be simply 3 classes in EQ Priests, Melee, Casters. *Yawn*<br />
<br />
Just like you cant compare a bard to a rogue. Its just not the same thing.  Yes as a healing capable class I agree something more is needed at 60, but remember the game was first created 50 was the end and mobs didnt have such huge damage or hit points.</div></div><hr />

How many times has your raid asked a druid to camp and play a guild cleric who's not online?<br />
<br />
<br />
How many clerics are present at raids vs how many druids?<br />

Just be paitient and wait for Planes of Power.  Complete Healing isn't affected by the focus items, and the new zones in PoP are extremelly likely to not let you cast a Complete Healing.  Verant will never totally nerf CH for the simple fact that they would have to rebalance nearly every encounter above level 45.<br />
<br />
If druids were given Complete Healing, it wouldn't bother me too much.  Just so long as they lost their best DOTs and snares.  You have to give up a lot of power to be balanced after gaining a lot of power.  Clerics never had it to give up.  Resurrections preserve your experience bar, they don't directly gain any experience.  Why group a cleric when you can buy a resurrection?</div></div><hr />

I think that sums it up nicely. <br />

Instead of blaming druids or clerics or any other class i think we need to blame the retards responsible for not playtesting things enough. The ones who never listen to our suggestions even though there are people out there who have probably put in more hours playing the game than were actually put into making it, and know what they are talking about when they say &quot;hey you guys should do this....&quot;<br />
<br />
There are always gonna be &quot;fruitcakes&quot; in every class, you can't help it. Clerics and Druids, at least as long as i can remember, have always competed for the same hunting grounds and the only people to blame for that are VI for creating that kind of environment and the idiots out there that make life hell for everyone else cause they give a bad name to people from that class.<br />

When do you try to hit your CH? Probably when the tank has 1 bub health left. Add a half a bub to that and thats what a 66% heal would do. That is SOOOO close to CH as is its not even funny.<br />
<br />
Just FYI, bit depending on the encounter CH is tried to time to land at (on average) 3 bubs of health on the person being healed, not 1 bub. At some mobs it's closer to 4 bubs (depending on how high their damage can suddenly peak).<br />

No 66% CH at the same mana and speed as cleric!<br />
<br />
If thats directed at my suggestion earlier in this thread then I urge you to reread my post because you missed the point (66%*(Max_HP - Current_HP) != 66%*Max_HP).<br />
<br />
I definitely agree that a 66%*Max_HP heal would be too good.<br />

<br />
Your comment is not a real answer to Pepin's statement.<br />
<br />
The contention is that clerics will still be locked into their current raid role even if they gain diversity.  How you did in an experience group in HS or OS with your druid is neither raid nor cleric (congratulations, though), and is really quite irrelevant.  Short of diversity including the ability to deathtouch any mob, clerics will still spend all their raid time pushing CH buttons and counting off the seconds no matter how much diversity they receive, because they're the only people who can do the job.<br />
<br />
Why do you think druids are ever called on to heal at a raid?  All druid heals are inferior to every equivalent cleric heal.  The only reason you have a druid healing at a raid (ignoring possible misuse) is because you don't have enough clerics to cover all the healing needs and the druid's &quot;diversity&quot; is deemed less valuable than his mediocre heals.  The same ultimately applies to clerics.<br />
<br />
  Changes to healing for the Raid Game will adversely affect grouping for experience, which is broken already.<br />
<br />
Only true if Verant's thinking is as limited as much of what I see here (and at the Druid's Grove).<br />
<br />
Consider, for example, what the effect would be if druids were given an area of effect (not group) instant heal for about 80 points that was low aggro, fast casting, and about the same efficiency as Chloroblast (2.2hp/mana) if it lands for full effect on six people.  Such a heal would be almost completely irrelevant for experience grouping, but it would make a huge difference on a large raid force fighting an AoE mob.  It would be a reason to bring two to four druids to the raid instead of one, because druids would be the most effective healers of AoE damage for large raid forces.  Such a heal would also have practically no impact on the cleric's secure push-a-button-and-count role at every raid.<br />
<br />
Changes to raid healing don't have to affect experience group healing, and actually don't have to impact the cleric raid role either.<br />
<br />
  Not everyone plays to get to the Raid Game.  The game should NOT be balanced for that small sector of the game.<br />
<br />
Irrelevant.  The game will never really be balanced so long as the end game is as drastically unbalanced as it is now.  So to balance the game, the end game will have to become more balanced.  Unless you insist on subscribing to that tired old school of thought that being able to solo well means that you must be penalized forever in the end game, in which case you need to be calling for monk nerfs more than worrying about druids getting a boost in the end game.<br />
<br />
  The REAL druid problem, as was pointed out before, is that 1/3 of the characters created are druids.<br />
<br />
A red herring.  The problem is demand, not supply.  <br />
<br />
I don't believe your 1/3 number, though I'll grant the number is large.  Regardless, many of those druids are created as port bots.  Very few of the rest will reach the level where they have to be concerned about guilds recruiting by class, as most guilds that aren't in the end game aren't too worried about class.  Supply is irrelevant, though, because as I said the problem is low demand.  If druids were as scarce as shadowknights, there would still be this &quot;too many&quot; concern, because the typical end game guild has its fill of druids when it has only two or three.  <br />
<br />
Remind me again how many clerics the typical end game guild needs...<br />
<br />
  There just arent roles enough on a raid for that many druids.<br />
<br />
Almost.  Actually, if you restrict your roles to essential roles that druids are best at, there are no essential roles for any druids.  Which is why the demand problem exists.<br />
<br />
    An underlying problem is that so many druids dont know their job.  And that comes from grouping with a lot of them and being disappointed by their lack of grouping skills.<br />
<br />
Largely not the case for the druids that have a legitimate concern.  Soloing druids don't exactly have a great need for heals, and by the end game the grouping druids generally do have their act together.  There are good and bad players for every class, of course.  There's also the flip side that many people who have no idea how to play a druid think they know exactly how one should be played under every circumstance.  Druids are diverse, and a well played druid doesn't play the same role in every circumstance.  Except, of course, when the raid leader says, &quot;The druid on this raid will heal group six.&quot;<br />

Probably none of us would have much trouble getting into a really good raiding guild, but druids are seen as not adding a whole lot on raids and so they're not need in 12-packs, like clerics are.</div></div><hr />

My experience in game DOES matter- because all the changes people post affect the xp game as well as the Raid Game. I have not seen one without the other.  You can say irrelevant all you want. Doesnt make it true.  Nice try though.<br />

Doesnt matter if many of the druids are bots.   Absurdly many are actively playing as well. I also have seen many of those &quot;BOTS&quot; become mains as well.  This indeed contributes to the poorly played druid problem.<br />
<br />
Doesnt matter if we are talking about &quot;grouping druids&quot; or &quot;solers&quot; because both types are represented in the druid plea for a role in raids.  Even if you removed the &quot;soloer's&quot; from the druid's- wanting-a-role-on -a raid, you would still have far too many druids as compared to other classes.  There are just too many druids in Norrath for all to have a role in a raid.<br />

My perspective comes as someone who can really play a druid.  I imagine that is foreign to many other druids, who cast their epic and sit down.  And then wonder why no one wants them on a raid.<br />

again and again it boils down to the mobs (especially in the end game encounters).  If a CH chain is needed AND the mob is fully magic resistant then druids offer some healing but no firepower (where alot of their strengths are).  But guess what, in these situations shamans can only buff and heal the same as druids, wizards have lure if that, chanters cant do much, mages have their pets, necros can only feed mana.....  its the mobs that become the problem for MANY classes.<br />

<br />
Granted, but you ignored the relevant part, which has to do with the impact of diversity on the cleric's role in...  We'll say most situations instead of &quot;raids&quot;.  That impact is likely to be very close to zero.  And even when I gave an explanation for why that role will not change, rather than trying to refute that argument you chose to debate what was or was not said.<br />

<br />
Yes, a nice try which you chose not to comment on.  Do you have any comments about my suggestion?  Does it displace a cleric from either a group or a raid?  I gave you something concrete which I feel shows that a raid change can be made which does not impact the experience dynamic, yet you're still attacking what &quot;others&quot; have said instead of rebutting my example that I believe shows your point of view to be invalid.<br />
<br />
 Doesnt matter if many of the druids are bots.   Absurdly many are actively playing as well. I also have seen many of those &quot;BOTS&quot; become mains as well.  This indeed contributes to the poorly played druid problem.<br />
<br />
Just as the cleric bot issue contributes to the poorly played cleric problem.  The main difference is that at 44 a bot druid has all the ports his &quot;master&quot; will ever need and there's very little incentive to take him high enough to enter the high end game.  No doubt there are some who continue their druid on past that point, but I have real doubts that it's common enough to contribute to &quot;druid overpopulation&quot;.  Most people know the druid's situation in the end game, even if they don't show it when they post on various class boards.<br />
<br />
 Doesnt matter if we are talking about &quot;grouping druids&quot; or &quot;solers&quot; because both types are represented in the druid plea for a role in raids.  Even if you removed the &quot;soloer's&quot; from the druid's- wanting-a-role-on -a raid, you would still have far too many druids as compared to other classes.  There are just too many druids in Norrath for all to have a role in a raid.<br />
<br />
And there are just too many paladins in Norrath for all to have a role on a raid.  And there are just too many shadowknights for all to have a role on a raid.  And there are just too many Beastlords for all to have a role on a raid.  And so on.  Of all the classes there are only a few (some would say only one: clerics) that guilds are willing to soak up in such quantities that someone playing that class could be assured of a spot in the high end game.  For those classes, the total number of them out there actually has relatively little impact on the ability to gain entrance into a high level guild.  They could be as &quot;overpopulated&quot; as druids and would very likely still be mostly soaked up.<br />
<br />
I never suggested that there would be a spot for every druid.  I would even go so far as to say that there shouldn't be.  Entrance into the best guilds should be earned, and not everyone, regardless of class, plays well enough to earn such an opportunity.  What I would like to see is a situation where druids have any role at all in the end game that justifies having more than one in the entire guild.<br />
<br />
 And yes, Shaiel is 60. That demeaned your whole argument.  I suggest you lose that tactic as it doesnt serve you   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I don't think so.  It was never my intention that I personally be served by any comment at all.  Like you, I have a druid, a cleric, and a rogue.  Both my druid and my cleric stay home when I go raiding with my guild, because I curently find neither particularly fun to play.  The druid cause is only peripherally my cause these days as I no longer play my druid except as a bot, so really it's not me being served or disserved.<br />
<br />
Your sixtiness really doesn't have much impact with me.  I make no allegation that such is that case with you, but level sixty characters can come from many sources, including e-bay.  Level sixty isn't a guarantee you have a pertinent view of what you're talking about.  I'm interested in hearing your arguments--not tired cliches like &quot;there are too many druids around&quot;, but arguments that contain specifics and show that you've really given thought to the issues.  By simply repeating the unsubstantiated mouthings of three years of druid bashers, you're not giving an argument worthy of a Heirophant who earned that rank, in my opinion, which is why I said &quot;It doesn't show.&quot;<br />
<br />
Regardless, this discussion is getting close to out-of-bounds, and I have no intention of continuing it.  All are entitled to their opinion, and few opinions are likely to be changed.  I still invite you to respond to my original reply to you, but would appreciate it if you gave concrete responses to the specific points rather than supporting your view with cliches and level.<br />

We tried it right the first time and were laughed at. Now we get silly and Clerics propose we get what we were suggesting in the first place - the very same thing they laughed at months ago.</div></div><hr />

The REAL druid problem, as was pointed out before, is that 1/3 of the characters created are druids.  There just arent roles enough on a raid for that many druids.  <br />

Obviously, I can't take ANON into the equation, which makes these numbers somewhat misleading.  It's my experience that Enchanters, Druids and Clerics would be most likely to be ANON, thus skewing those numbers down artificially.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">07-13-2002, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What it all comes down to is that Verant failed to explain their vision of the different classes and people were surprised at high level after devoting a lot of time, energy and even love into their characters.  No one told druids they would be unable to raid seriously.  No one told clerics they would be unable to solo reasonably.  No one told shamans they could expect to die very early in big fights.  If they had done so, we could all point to The Vision Statement (TM), but there is no such document, just statements that seem to change.<br />
<br />
Druids should understand that clerics are concerned that they are only going to be needed on raids and be unable to do anything else.  Being unwelcome in experience groups is something druids can relate to, but at least the druids were able to camp experience or loot.  Clerics are far more limited in the other things that they can do.  Druids declaring that Verant should give them the raid healer slot as well tends to upset clerics that are already concerned about their worth.</div></div><hr />

The 2k heal REALLY depends on mana/casting time.  Some druids may have asked for a 300 mana, 6 second 2k heal which is much better than what a cleric has.  While clerics have proposed a much different version of the 2k heal, more like 600 mana and 9 seconds or something.<br />

Given the fact that shaman are the best solo class, one of the best group classes and a damn good raid class.  <br />
<br />
No it just means that their role doesn't overlap greatly.  Theres no shame in that - join an exp group and you will notice one thing.  Clerics dont overlap at all.  2 clerics in a group generall mean that group is struggling (not always), whereas other classes can overlap.  How many rogues you have at a raid doesn't matter, because they add on above each other.<br />
<br />
The fact is healing on raids overlaps, nuking overlaps, debuffing/buffing doesn't.  Two of druids 3 big raid abilities overlap however they are not the best at it.  I'm sorry it seems that druids want to pick and choose to either be as good as a wizard at nuking or as good as a cleric at healing.  I'm sorry thats just too overpowered.  Yes the min maxing of eq has lead to classes who don't do things as well as other classes to be boardlined - but unless VI creates an overlap role for all classes (one that doesn't overlap over classes) you will always find this situation.<br />
<br />
EQ is a game - like all games people tend to specialise.  Like strikers in football will not make particular good defender and vice versa the same is true for EQ.  Those good at one thing can't fill in the shoes of another, whereas those that can do multiple can, but do it worse than the specialists.  <br />
<br />
Yes you can get people who are good at all areas, but asking VI to do this for one class is a little unfair on the rest of us don't you think?</div></div><hr />

I, for one, still believe that higher level druids need an upgrade to Superior Heal. Give it to them at 58 or 60, whatever.<br />
<br />
I assume that clerics will also come in for some improvements as VI moves towards tweaking priestly classes. I'd love more anti-undead power: an undead-only snare or super root? Wouldn't that be fun?<br />

<br />
Afterlife has 3 active druids..not 2 or 24.  We have 3 active druids because that's how many druids were good enough to get into the guild.  Do we need anymore?  Probably not.  Will we take another?  Sure, when one comes along that meets our standards.<br />
<br />
Our druids play vital roles on our raids.  They know their class, and they play it well.  Druids are also not the only class with low numbers in our guild.  We have 3 shaman.  We have 0 Shadow Knights.  We have 3 Paladins.  We have 3 Rangers.  We have 3 bards. We have 2 magicians...do you see a pattern here?<br />
<br />
Does this mean all those classes need &quot;raid balancing&quot; also?  I'm not saying I'm against a small heal upgrade for Druids.  But Complete Heal is out of the question.  I'd like to see a new heal for all priest classes.  Something between DL and CH, with different mana costs/cast times for each priest.<br />
<br />
Yes, there are certain classes raids need more of - such as clerics - because the game has been built around it.  Clerics pay many times over for being absolutely necessary on raids..both by losing out on typical experience groups, as well as never being able to afk for more than a few seconds at a time...or someone is liable to be dead when we return.<br />

I could go on, but most of the points I'd make have already been made....Many falling on deaf ears.<br />

 <br />
  The pattern I see is that the vital role of the druids is doubtless one no different than the ranger or paladin without all the bow plinking and sword swinging, that being to toss some heals so the first couple CHs don't result in a dead cleric.  I don't know about your guild or how many 2box clerics you have but even with a roster of 12+ having a raid called a couple times a week is not unsual for lack of CHers.  10 druids 5 clerics no raid, 0 druids 7 clerics and AoW dies.  Blatently obvious druids play no role in the raid heal game beyond that of a ranger or a paladin, no?<br />
 <br />
  Although I don't consider druids primarly healers most druids are under the delusion they are.  Since the HP increase and resistance decrease on mobs druids are much closer to wizards than clerics, but the simple fact is you can't get enough healing.  If wizards were given superior heal they'd never get to cast a nuke again, much as many magicians do nothing but churn out rods for... Clerics to turn into CH and shamans torpor clerics and magicians for more rods.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Does this mean all those classes need &quot;raid balancing&quot; also? I'm not saying I'm against a small heal upgrade for Druids. But Complete Heal is out of the question.

 <br />
  DL needs an upgrade.  Druids already have a 60 heal so unless they go and change NT directly they aren't getting it.  Focus item, AA and now the removal of the 10% healing penalty which seem to be coming are nice but still not enough.  Even using an instaclicky with max AA and both healing focus and mage ring for cast time focus I can't keep a robie alive with Nature's Touch in Ssra if they get agro off a yardtrash.  Caster mitigation and avoidance are complete **** and yardtrash doubles and triples 200s and 300s.  Then I can't res them either but thats another thread.<br />
 <br />

 <br />
  Clerics do not lose out on typical XP groups past mid 40s or low 50s (oh look, that took 1 day played to get through, well it did my cleric anyway =P)  Looking at cleric and druid AA points I've seen shows clerics are having no problem getting XP, they're a prime choice for duoing with a warrior, another abundant class, and the backbone of many of luclin's wonderful shard / key camps and CT loot camps.  Clerics also get in AE groups where they can spend lots of time AFK, something druids don't.  Druids get to solo with crummy DOTs that let them get far less XP than a necro, shaman or even meleer soloing, or use charm/quad/AE soloing in one of like 4 spots in the game that are completely taken by 4 people.  Without starweave adding a druid to an xp group as a damage dealer just brings the group's xp down, without CH/rez adding them as a healer is just plain stupid, either you don't need them or they probably won't be able to keep up.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I could go on, but most of the points I'd make have already been made....Many falling on deaf ears.&quot;<br />
 <br />
  Speaking of deaf ears...  What points, that 33% of the players are druids?  I think the third page of responses here, aside from the occasional idiot and troll, do a pretty good job refuting the stated negative points.<br />
 <br />
  Honestly, I can't see how you can reconcile saying you have a couple druids and as many clerics as you can grab but giving those druids CH is bad.  You're telling me you want, no NEED more CHers, but ONLY if they're clerics.  That sounds... for lack of a better word, rather prejudiced.  Hell, if anything, an argument for druids getting CH.  Would you rather a 2box cleric in the CH chain or a primary druid?<br />
 <br />
  Clerics are essential on a raid.  That isn't a bad thing, aego or symbol, rez, rez sticks all make a cleric essential, but needing 8 CHers is what makes 1 person in every 6 playing a cleric be essential and THAT is bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the record tho, I do think druids could use a better heal in the 55+ range. faster casting, or better ratio, or both. I just dont think druids would be happy with CH if they did get it.<br />

It was just before Kunark, and I was moving from AC because I couldn't convince any of my friends it was superior (FOOLS!).  Anyway, I read fan sites and guides, etc; The one that struck me was at Caster's Realm, and said something to the effect of &quot;play a cleric and you will never be looking for a group, everyone will need you, and you will see everything.&quot;  Sounded like great time!  Silly me.<br />
<br />
Most of us aren't knocking a new heal.  What we are frowning on is complete heal.  Look, we all know VI hates it.  They've admitted as much.  It is a spell they wish they could get rid of, wish had never come into being.  But they can't.  Too much of the game is centered around it now.  The odds of them making it more common are about the same odds as me waking up and being Pope.<br />
<br />
So what to do?  Instead of focusing on cheal, our one trick pony spell, why don't you druids focus the energy on a better direct heal or group heal spell?  You're likely to get a lot further than screaming about getting a spell which VI already wishes they could remove.  And for those of you druids who are actually envious of the life of a cleric... yikes.  You must like tedium.<br />

Clerics have issues.<br />
Druids have issues.<br />
EVERY CLASS HAS ISSUES.<br />
<br />
BUT hopefully the game developers understand that you cant take all the skills from one class and give it to another without there being MAJOR unbalancing.  This is a difficult task I am sure. We have to have some small measure of faith that they are up to this task.<br />
<br />
The game has evolved to a certain extent not how the designers wanted it to, but how the players played it.  If we didnt develop strats like the CH chain, mobs wouldnt had to have developed the way they did.  We, the players, have molded and shaped this game into what it is.  If you want to cast blame on someone for &quot;messing up your class&quot; go look in a mirror, because you are just as big a part of it as the other person behind their monitor playing OtherClass03.<br />

Until we are all happy as can be with our classes just try to live with what you DO have, not lamenting about what you DONT have.<br />

We do. This post that you're refrering to, is one druid who says he wants CH and Manaburn... His post does NOT speak for the greater part of the druid community. Maybe he did it because he really want's these things, or maybe he did it to open people's eyes to our problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahaha. Really? Cos, what, a shaman can go out and solo a dragon in the WW? Maybe a Sebilite Juggernaut? Pray tell, how much XP do I get from soloing a Lictor of the Heart if it takes me ten minutes to do it. Considerably less than you're going to be getting in a group, and much less than a druid is going to be getting soloing.<br />
<br />
Groups. You got me. Hell, the druid got it almost perfectly when he said...<br />
<br />
 A shaman gets his regeneration spells ten levels earlier, gets very nice mana regeneration capability starting at level 24, has the ability to mitigate large amounts of damage through the use of slows, can significantly increase melee damage output through haste, and at the levels you're talking about can even tank for short periods of time.<br />
<br />
Yep. That's just what I do. Sorry? Though it does bear noting that when I'm grouped with a chanter, their haste is better than mine. By upwards of 18 percent. Whilst their slow is only 5 percent less effective than mine. p0 f0 me. I also can't mez, buff mana regeneration or mez. Stupid chanters.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
To be honest, I've never had much of respect for any druid's argument that involved them being sad that they couldn't get in on groups, though. Cos whenever I get a druid into my group, they start whining about how they could be getting sooooo much more XP soloing. Recently, my roommate's girlfriend, whose main was a druid, started getting her rogue PLed by him. Result? Her going on and on and on about how much she hated grouping, and how slooow the XP was.<br />
<br />
And finally, on raids. Shamans don't stack on raids. You need two shamans on any given raid wherein the mob can be slowed. If the mob cannot be slowed, you need one shaman to focus, brute and shrink, then to pretend like the DoTs he tosses out there really mean a whole lot. <br />
<br />
In the end, it's like this; everyone looks over the fence and sees green grass, and in EQ, everyone gets so jealous of that green grass that they want some damn green grass of their own. But very few people really spend any great amount of time looking at it from the perspective of those he's bitching about. I'd love for shamans to stack more on raids, but I'm realistic. I know we'll never get stacking DoTs, and I sure as hell don't want CH. I'm happy with my role.<br />
<br />
Everyone just needs to find their role and be happy in it. Which is where the issue lies. Druids don't really have a role. Being great at quad-kiting isn't big on most raids, 'cept maybe like Tunare raids, or pulling Temple in Fear. Secondary healers, secondary nukers, tertiary DoTers, second tier debuffers.<br />

Frankly, I donno what will fix the class, but I can say with one hundred percent postitudinality (I just made that word up, feel free to use it) that giving them CH, or manaburn, or slows, or hastes, or Trueshot, or HT, or rezzes, or a two thousand point DoT or anything that just copies another person's 'role' is not the answer, cos if they're just gonna be second best at something else, rather than being required for something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ummmmm yes actually, I think that would be a very good indicator that Shaman are the kings of soloing. If a single person can take on a mob that requires an entire group or two to kill, regardless of the amount of time it takes, I think that more than speaks to the amount of power a class has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahimiron</div><div class="date">07-17-2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A 'king' of soloing is capable of doing it to either farm or for raking in XPs. To me, that puts monks as the kings of the solo grind, followed by necros and beastlords. Shamans are nowhere near the top.<br />
<br />
So, yes, shamans can kill a dragon by themselves. So can ShadowKnights. Go to the SK boards and tell them that they don't need any help because they're clearly the undisputed power of the melee class.</div></div><hr />

I know how it is. No one reads anything but the general board on the Shaman's Crucible, either. Still, someone over there, a pally in fact, posted this, which I think sums up my feelings on the whole issue perfectly, and I felt it deserved to be heard by at least another of the factions involved in the devastating Priest Triangle Laddy Match for the Verant Interactive Intercontinental Championchip Belt.<br />
<br />

I'm not going to bother posting this on the Druid Boards. Half the time I feel like I'm watching Jerry Springer when I read those posts, the rest of the time I'm torn between feeling like a masochist for not pressing the little 'x' in the upper right corner or find myself agreeing with the flickering spark of rational thought most people are ignoring or pass over. Some people bring up valid points I agree with, most do not. <br />
<br />
I don't know about every class in the game, but as a raid leader I do as much research into the classes as I can, so I know how to effectively place/use them in a given situation/event/raid. I will never know every class intimately, nor do I claim to. So don't presume I am or I will label you incompotent and further look down on you, as I will explain a little later. <br />
<br />
Druids do need a boost. I have one in my regular EXP group and I can tell you that when I can channel through a heal for the same amount a 56 Druid can as a 57 Paladin, there's a serious problem there. Paladins are Hybrids, PART healer. We shouldn't be healing comparable to a Priest Class of the same level. Our group heal is one thing, we needed a generic beneficial raid ability other than DS/BMB, but direct heal is something else. Know what makes it even more pathetic? We get Superior Heal at 57 but get our previous healing spell, Greater Heal, at 39. We have to wait 18 levels for our next heal, which is then followed by the best group heal in the game a level later and the level after that with a great HoT spell. When Paladins get shafted for a healing spell for 18 levels and get one just as good as a Druid's of equal level that's pretty sad and speaks volumes for the necessity of a Druid revamp. (I made this comparison so that people could get an UNDERSTANDING of how badly Druids need their heals fixed not because Paladins need to be nerfed, as I'm sure more than one person was thinking about as they read this.) <br />
<br />
If you want to fix them, give Druids a HoT that stacks with all other HoTs (Cleric, Paladin, Shaman's Torpor ... notice that this is a new fresh idea? Creativity does wonders in this day and age and it gives merit that you're not just ripping something else off out of jealousy but looking for ways to improve YOUR class). Give them the best DS in the game--by a long shot. Give them the best group/single target regen. Give Druids the option of coming up with a list of new ideas and look it over to pick something out ... but unfortunately because of a few, this is never going to happen. Druids have shot themselves in their collective foot. Again, I will elaborate on this in a moment. <br />
<br />
I have to apologize here, but if Druids want to be a Priest class then why are they calling for a better nuke? The last time I checked Priest Classes weren't supposed to have super nukes because they can heal. That's why Casters get all the good nukes. They can't heal. It's called Balance. (Before some triggerhappy reader decides to flame this comment because they skimmed the post, take the time to read the entire 'essay' or just read the previous paragraph and let it sink in, then try and take this all in context.) <br />
<br />
Go ahead and flame me, but before you do, think about this: with as many druids rallying behind the CH/Manaburn post do you honestly expect to be taken seriously? You're asking for two spells/abilities that are class-defining. If you want your class defined, think up something ORIGINAL and UNIQUE to your own class. Don't ask for Manaburn and then call it Scorched Earth. Don't ask for Complete Heal and then call it Tears of Tunare or something else equally cute. And before you flame this, there was nothing to label the CH/Manaburn post as sarcastic or something to be taken as a joke. <br />
<br />
I'm not tyring to be mean, but logical. As an English Major and writer, if someone came up to me and said, &quot;Hey Jack! I want to be able to write like Tom Clancy, Orson Scott Card, Isaac Asimov, Robert Jordan, Stephen King and J.R.R. Tolkien; the best of all worlds!&quot; I would immediately label them daft, never take anything they said or wrote seriously again and would give them the 'Editor's Treatment' of reading the hook line and not wasting my time by going further. Any writer worth anything writes the way THEY write, not like some other writer. That makes you an unoriginal hack. That's why I detest people telling me I write like PKD, Jack O'Connell (sp?) or K.W. Jeter. <br />
<br />
Here's another example, in case the previous one didn't make sense to you: have you seen the insurance commercials where the Plumber is walking up the stairs as water is running down, tracking it into a flooded apartment with people floating around on the furniture? The Plumber says, &quot;Guess I'd better get to work&quot; or something to that effect and the renter retorts, &quot;Before you do can I get your price and the price of three of your leading competitors?&quot; You know that dumbfounded look the plumber gives the kid? That's exactly the way people are looking at you now because of that one post and the way it's being handled. <br />
<br />
Yes, Druids need a revamp. <br />
<br />
You are going about it the wrong way. <br />
<br />
Oh, and for those of you flaming Druids or the Druids flaming back: grow up. If you want to see who can come up with the better one-liner or wave the biggest dick, have someone pick up and wave Rush Limbaugh or Howard Stern or that screwed-in-the-head psychiatrict woman who had(has?) her own talkshow. Because right now you guys have gone from cute to 'Carrot Top Live In Las Vegas' annoying. <br />
<br />
There's a lot of positive on this board, and that's why I'm coming back every day to learn more and more about the Shaman class and that contributes more to my wanting to play mine to up 60 as a secondary 'Main'. I frequent the Paladin boards because I haven't seen a 'flame war' there in ages. I love the little class communities where people are sharing information, being informative/helpful and having fun. The Shaman community's relaxed and 'at home' feel comes from all you Shaman out there, you're real class acts. That said, is there any real reason to get so ugly over this?<br />
