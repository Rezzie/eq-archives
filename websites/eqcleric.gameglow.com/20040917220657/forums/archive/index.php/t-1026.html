But...I know soon the cost is going to be outrageous.<br />
<br />
I only apply symbol to the tanks and enchanter in the group, but still, if I notice a tank isn't taking a ton of damage, I really don't want to use the stone for symbol.  How do I tell them nicely that I don't think it's necessary?<br />
<br />
Further...how can I tell them that if they want the symbol, to bring their own stones?<br />

Let them know that in addition to the reagents you have to spend money for armor and spells.  Ask them if they could help ease your costs by purchasing a few of the needed reagents and bringing them with them when they group with you - or let you loot a little bit extra to help make up the cost.<br />

*In a &quot;Friends&quot; group I always use Symbol, they know the costs, they give me a bagfull of FS or plat at the end of the week ect...<br />
<br />
*In a &quot;put together group&quot; If I notice the tanks have not gone past half HP in an hour, I will tell them we are laying off the Symbols for now.  If we get hit by a train 5 mins later, the first heal I cast IS symbol =) (Still if you have a chanter or Wizz always on them)<br />

I think at Lv15, you should be saving money for spells and stuff. Symbol spells around that level don't do good for cost.<br />

<br />
I got called a ****ty cleric last night - The Monk in my group wanted symbol - I asked if she had a peridot - she said she wanted symbol - I said symbol cost - I need peridot or 12pp<br />
<br />
Then she said I was ****ty cleric for not symboling(?) the puller and Main tank  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif and I should do that because I am cleric in group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DwarfCleric</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats depressing is the first symbol you get only adds 30 extra HP (what a waste of gold *sigh*).  As far as casting it, depends on the group makeup.  If theres one 'real' tank (i.e. warrior) I give it to them, others get the armor and center line of spells buff.  If theres several 'kinda' tanks (i.e. pallys, rangers, rogues) I give them all buffs except symbol.  Others in group get armor and daring buff.  I'll see if this changes in another 20 or so lvls though  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Until then, this should work.  As far as people getting mad for not getting symboled, ignore em, if they don't understand the costs to a cleric then they shouldn't be worth your time or money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many situations don't even call for symbol, heck, many situations don't call for any buffs at all. Players besides the clerics just don't have a good feel for that.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, it's your job to keep the group alive and you get to decide how to do that. If you think a symbol is not warranted in the current situation, then don't cast it.</div></div><hr />

Typically, I'll cast it on someone who is at the bottom end of the group, to increase their survivability odds, and on anyone else who seems to be popular with getting smacked around. I do buff everyone with armor/valor as necessary, if anyone whines about wanting the symbol as well I'll weigh the situation and go from there. (Why waste the mana/reagent for blue/even mobs in a group of 3+?)<br />
I will almost always give it to guildmates who ask, since most of them are very liberal with their gifts.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

After level 39, additional hitpoints that the tanks receive benefits YOU, their cleric because your complete heal just got that more mana efficient.  (Screw mana efficiency, symbol yer chanter. Trust me.)<br />
     In addition to my cleric, I also play a Warrior (currently 29).  So far, I've found that HP buffs while nice, aren't really necesary.  I would rather have a cleric with plenty of mana to heal me, than one that is struggling to keep mana by HP buffing every tank in the group.  If you're getting swamped by critters every pull, then symbol might not be a bad insurance policy.  However in normal fighting situations, a tank at 80% health is a tank at 80% health no matter if his Max hitpoint value is 1000 or 1250.<br />
     I've always viewed cleric nukes as something to use when you're full mana.  No sense sitting there FM, and missing with my stick is just plain silly.  While playing my warrior, if the group cleric starts tossing a bunch of nukes, I take that as a clue I'm not pulling fast enough and that can easily change.<br />
     As side note, it's rough playing a very cleric dependant class when your main IS a cleric.  Somehow those high standards that I've built myself up to over 55 levels just seem few and far between in the mid-20s crowd &lt;grin&gt;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verbannen</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at it realistically.  For most people, more HP just means you have more time to cast heal on them.<br />
<br />
If there isn't a reasonable chance of them dropping below 2 bubbles, then you are better off spending your mana for heals and stuns.<br />
<br />
The story changes once you start using complete heal.  Since it costs the same mana to heal any number of HP, you want the person you are casting it on to have as many HP as possible to maximize efficency.<br />
<br />
People with low HP whom often are the targets (enchanters) also needs as many HP as possible to give you the few seconds it takes to cast on them.<br />
<br />
About the only time I will fully buff everyone in my group is when we are breaking into a room, zone, or fighting a dragon type mob.</div></div><hr />

This will often be the enchanter, the puller and the main tank but rarely me due to da/db but it obviously depends on the situation. <br />
<br />
Symbol at lvl 15.. dont. The first symbol spell starts out giving a mere 37hp but rises to 73hp within a couple of levels. Wait atleast until it yields 73hp before using it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thalanar</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm only 37th, so I cannot speak for large raid situations, where I would imagine symbol spells to be highly important.<br />
<br />
I don't find myself using symbol all that often.  More often nowadays, but not all the time.  I typically use it a) on tanks and enchanters (and everyone else if mana permits) when we are first breaking into a room that could be challenging, b) if we will be fighting a very difficult named soon, and c) small groups where the extra hitpoints are vital.<br />
<br />
In most normal hunting situations, symbol is not necessary.  If you are in a situation where you must have symbol on your group at all times just in order to stay alive, you might want to reconsider your situation ... one bad pull, or spawn in a tight mana situation, and that will be trouble, regardless of how many hitpoints people have.<br />
<br />
You could spend your mana adding hitpoints, or maybe using stuns to reduce healing, and the occasional nuke to help quick finish something off, etc.  You are the cleric, don't let people tell you what to do.  Always be open to suggetions, but when it is your money and your group's life, you are the one to make the call.  I see symbol as a situational spell, not a &quot;necessary&quot; buff to keep going.<br />

I'd like to know where you hunt, Maelstrome.  Guess I'll have to start charging more for rezzes.  =p  The difference between jasper and peridot is about 100 hp, which for &gt;90% of encounters isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Jaspers are disepnsed freely, but if someone wants a peridot, well I hope you have one yourself, cuase I sure won't.  I've had several people ask me to cast deathpact on them.  Hmmm kinda glad in some ways I dont' have that spell yet.  There'd be another 4pp moneysink.  I think I'll go on strike and when the gems I have now run out, well that's it.  Guess maybe I'll have to talk people in to going to seblis more so I can get some loot to pay for things.  Hehe.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm now that I think of it.  I never here enchanters complain.  I almost always see them rune themselves and that's a peridot a shot there too.  But then on the other hand I never here anyone begging for it like they beg for symbol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
   1. everyone gets reso, if there is a 49+ druid in the group, have him put SLN on the tanks, a few less HP's but better AC and regen.<br />
<br />
   2.  All tanks and enchanter get shield of words.  Others may get AC buff if it seems likely we will be fighting more then 2 monsters at a time.<br />
<br />
   3.  Symbol, I only really use this on the whole group when the situation might get out of hand (possibility of more then 3 or 4 monsters at once and we might have to evac).  People that always get symbol unless we are fear/snaring.  Enchanter, main tank if I'm using Cheal, and the puller.<br />

As far as telling people that they don't need symbol, the out of stones excuse works great.<br />

If ye'd like to reread my post, I'm sure you'll see the error of your ways....I said Pinzarn is cheap.  Last time I cast it, it burned a jasper (7 and a half gold, it doesn't get much cheaper).  No Peridot's aren't cheap, but if your in a group of people who've got a clue, they'll take care of you.  Once you get Marzin, you'll forget all about that crappy lil Naltron. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Throckjr</div><div class="date">09-03-2000, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things to add, plus I just want to say that the information posted here is an excellent resource.  Most of the posts and replies are well thought out and informative.  I am just adding to the discussion and not discrediting the ablilities of anyone that has replied to this thread or any other.<br />
<br />
That said, I beleive that you guys are overlooking the pre-20 Clerical experiences.  I have ALWAYS used the Symbol line, ON THE MAIN TANK since I had it scribed.  As soon as I could I filled a small bad with Cat's Eye Agates, and Center, AC-buff, symbol were the first to go on a tank that entered group.  <br />
<br />
The response has been, the first symbol is only 37hp.  That is true.  That does not make the symbol useless, IMHO.  That 37hp is one or two rounds of damage from mobs of equal level.  I beleive the HP addition increases per level also.  <br />
<br />
That does not mean I left it up.  Everyone on Rallos knows that Suudar is always broke!  A techinique I use is to buff myself first, then anyone else, that way I know when to rebuff and noone has to ask.  If it's not taxing my mana supply to heal the tank, then Symbol doesn't get reapplied.  <br />
<br />
Whenever an enchanter or a wizzie enters the group the symbol goes up, and stays up.  Those two seem to draw unswerving attention.  The added hps from the symbol give me more time to keep them alive.<br />
<br />
People learn what the costs of Symbols are, and if you are using them, they make sure to split loots or get you some extra costs.  Most tanks now carry stones with them, and I get prolly a dozen jaspers at the start of a group and a tell, &quot;Keep my symbol up, and the extras are yours.&quot;  Now, that's the way to do it, and I make sure that that person doesn't go long without symbol.  Even if everyone in the group is saying don't waste mans and reagents on that rogue he's taking no damage.  Heh, he gave me the stones to take care of him, he gets it, end of story.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, the main puller, enchanter and wizard get symbol without thinking about it.  The rest is per case basis.  The exception being &quot;the stone giver.&quot;  What it boils down to is your best judgement as the cleric in the group.<br />
