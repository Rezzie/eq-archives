</FONT><HR>Uber gear?  Not quite.  I earned the money for the horse by dumping the money I had been saving for one into pottery and then selling spiritstones and faithstones cheaper than I have seen them priced on any other server, and I was looking.  I priced them low because I felt they shouldn't be uber gear, but common to all Clerics and Shamans who could use.  I spent a LOT of time researching, skilling up, and gathering materials so I could make any stone at any time.<P>I SHOULD have spent that money on that uber gear you were talking about, I didn't.  Most of my equipment is old, I have only upgraded 3 items in the last four levels (56 now, not 60).  A 4 wisdom earring, a 8 wisdom belt and a 5 wisdom neckpiece.  No Velious gear, the plate was going to melees in the guild I used to belong to.  Nor did I go to the dungeon planning to charge a copper, and I didn't.  I did this because I like playing a cleric and like to help people.  Yes, the mobs need balancing.  Mid 30's wurms in Great Divide shouldn't cast mid 50's nukes, nor should they complete heal themselves until they are at least 39.<P>The point isn't making me feel like a big shot, the point is that the game NEEDS healers again.  Since I like playing one, and since we were simple heal batteries before, I was burnt out badly.  The only thing you could do before this patch was screw something up.  Not much fun.  Now you can shine IF you know the class.  Paladins will be very valuable to groups as well due to their stuns.  When was the last time you considered getting a paladin in a group if you could get a shadowknight?  Before this, stuns were rarely worth the effort.  I don't like being a heal battery.<P>POed because a cleric can run as fast as your bard?  I imagine you expect that cleric to come resurrect you, and you want to waste even more of that cleric's time?  Or perhaps you are better than most bards about taking a cleric to your corpse.  The horse isn't very useful for fighting, only traveling.  Perhaps it is useful for boss fights, but it is very hard to maneuver in a fight on a horse.  Stopping, casting and not being interrupted is a challenge.  Nearly every form of speed enhancement is superior to a horse due to the intertia a horse has.  The major benefit of a horse in a group is not sitting while regening mana.  Outside the group, I can travel faster.  Do you think I was planning to go to Dahlnir last night or something?  What is there for a 56 cleric except corpses to resurrect?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Exactly WHAT is it that angers you so?<P>That a high level cleric took his time to help lower level people?<P>That he has a horse?<P>Hey, as a bard you can pretty much buy all the rezzes you will ever want for 100k = buying another "class' abilities". <P>But then, speed was never just a bard-ability like you try to make it.

</FONT><HR>No, it angers me that it REQUIRED that high level person.  And he's an idiot if he thinks healers weren't needed before this, they just used to need equal level healers, instead of one 30 levels above them.  But yeah, I guess if that's what it takes for him to have fun, more power to him.<P>As for bard speed... hmmmm, yeah, I remember how any class in the game could go selos speed before this... No, wait, I just woke up from your dream.  It WAS a bard only thing before, now the thing I could take pride in as being "unique" to my char is sold off like trash.<P>No, I don't enjoy being angry, that's why I don't play her anymore.  But, as you've obviously spent no time leveling up a char so you could have something special like that and watched it being sold off, you wouldn't understand.

</FONT><HR>I found EQ in September. Fooled around with a shaman and a warrior, before I found "my class" with the Cleric. He is now 50, after 24 /played days.<P>So no, I havent played this game for long, but I _have_ spent time levelling a character with all that entails.<P>On to the rest of your post. <P>You make the impression that a level 60 cleric was necessary in a level 30 zone (or something similar). I assume that this group had already been fighting for a long time, before the wipeout. (Read: They had managed on their own!).<BR>Something happened, party wiped out. That happens. Now, a CR is not always a clean affair. From his post I received the impression that the party kept the area clear for him to work rezzes, and he helped with heals from time to time. <P>Maybe it is wrong that it is necessary with a high level person to help with a CR? But you are generalizing. You make it seem like this goes for all zones. And even then, you ignore the fact that this party had happily been fighting before the wipe out. <P>I take special note of your statement, "And he's an idiot if he thinks healers weren't needed before".<P>Healers are ALWAYS needed, and have always been. The question is what kind of healer is needed. A shammy or druid can mostly keep up with damage in an ordinary XP group, but with these changes there are camps where ONLY clerics are able to keep up with the DPS of the mobs.<P>This has done much, much, much more for the cleric class than any focus item (which has favoured any other caster class better than the cleric).<P>Next, again your complaint that others can run fast. How often do you see a horseman in EQ? I see one maybe once a day, tops. And in the time of a day I see maybe... 1000 people in game?<BR>And even at that, I would not say as many as 0.1% of the EQ population has a horse. Maybe 0.01% is more like it.<P>But, I am taking numbers out of the air, so instead of using that argument:<P>Is Selo's why you chose a bard? Is Selo's what makes you feel special? Is not a true bard one who can twist 4 songs in the heat of the battle, keep mobs mezzed and charmed, and still deliver steady damage?<BR>It reminds me of Fansy. (Fansy was a level 5 bard on the PvP server that got the ruleset changed because he used Selo's to train magnificient SG trains onto unsuspecting (or at the end, suspecting), evil people in Oasis). He had only Selo's, you have so much more.<P>Are you really so angered by the fact that a few select people are able to pay 100k pp and get a horse? To me it smacks of egoism.<P>(And please do leave personal side attacks out of it, it does not make you look any better)<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The thing that most surprised me was that these were full groups.  I expected to find a druid powerleveling a monk in Dahlnir.  I expected to find two or three people grouped with a warrior I resurrected earlier in Great Divide.  In both cases, I found full groups instead of two or three people.  I stayed in Dahlnir and did some spot healing with Celestial Healing while I watched the damage the spells were doing.  The tank in question was a Beastlord with a Ranger as secondary.  Not the best of tanks to begin with.  I have passed through Fungus Grove a lot and seen two or three people groups lately.  Not a lot of those included a cleric either.  Those that did were the same guild, and possibly the same person on two computers.<P>As I said, the spells need to be balanced.  Simply keeping the spell levels appropriate to the mob levels should solve the problem.  Using PvP spell rules might also be needed.  But it really did do me a lot of good to see full groups instead of soloers and duoers.  I am sorry if you think staying and helping with some healing while I guaged what I could expect in groups myself was somehow a power trip.  It wasn't, I was mainly trying to get a feel for damage output and where the surprises would be for me.  While I was there, one of the people fell down the hole to the next level.  I went to lead that person out without worrying that the group would be wiped out while I was away.  The group hadn't been wiped out to begin with, they had simply had two people die.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I've seen a lot of mashochistic thoughts regarding the latest changes.  I can hardly believe that people actually like the new changes.  Funcom did the same exact thing with Anarchy Online and they never changed it back.  People still complain about it to this day.  <P>This was not tested on the Test server.  This was never discussed with the players.  This was never polled.  This latest change is about the stupidest thing I have ever seen in an online game.  You can take back those little focus item stats and then throw back the mob AI to what it was.  EQ just got a Hell of a lot harder for no damn reason.  <P>Pure and simple; high level nukes were not meant to be used on players.  Give me 15K hit points and I'll change my viewpoint.  But with only 3400HP it's absoultely ludicrous for wizard mobs to have PC spell power.  How about we give them all Cloak of Flames haste next?  Just because we can.  <BR> <BR>Worst_change_ever.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Just wanted to post on my experiences with the new adjustment.<P>I have and always be a big fan of Mistmoore Castle.  It was an excelent place to level up from 20 to 34 or so.<P>It was always dificult before with caster mobs in the first place and trains that could rival KC.<P>Now with the changes it has increased in dificulty at least 3 fold without adding any more incentive to fight there.<P>Take for example the Graveyard area.  The cleric mobs in there can now CH and do often.  Moreso they have a hell of a mana pool.  One mob managed to get of 7 Complete Heals over the course of the fight.  Thats right 7 CH.  Now, notiably it was a longer fight because of this but I can't do 7 CH's in a fight unless I have KEI on and plenty of med time.  This guy wasn't meding he was beating the hell out of me.<P>I believe they sure made Mistmoore a much more interesting place to be but there ought to be some compensation for it.  Now a group of level 20's or higher can't do near as well and it really will take a higher level group to acomplish anything or even enjoy themselves.<P>While doing an Essence of Moonlight farming expedition with the guild we had 2 groups on average of level 53 people.  We could clear most of the castle, but our level 60s spent the whole night dotted, slowed, and getting nuked nonstop.  I agree with a previous poster.  How in the hell can a green spawn to a level 45 cast and land time after time on level 60 characters for full damage?<P>My grumble is that it took two balanced groups in their upper 50s to do this.  Not to mention that there is no experience for most of the group, and none that is actually noticable.<P>I like the changes in that it makes the EQ experience a little more exciting, you have to be more careful and more alert for what mobs can and will do.  I don't like the fact that in order to even accomplish certain things now you have to bring massive overkill for very little to no benefit at all.<P>Even the DE hut on the way though LF to MM is a heck of an experience now.  Typically I would run right though it since with SoW I would be in and out of their grasp before any real damage could be dealt.  Now, I die.  First time though I got dispelled of SoW, snared, followed by root, then slowed, and nuked to a bloody pulp.  And this with a level 53 Warrior.  I was dead almost before I could realize I had no chance.  Chalk up 4 more greenies that can waste me in no time flat.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Actually, the changes are pretty nice. I would agree the game got harder but consider this, how often have you been in a high level group only to sit down there, refreshing buffs and only heal if the pulls wasn't in it's expected form, and even that isn't very often. I've been in some groups which consisted of nothing more than a cleric (me), and 5 assorted melee types and we didn't have problems with pulls. It used to be a joke to fight spell casting mobs.<BR>Whats wrong with the mobs casting spells more their level? Yes I agree that it still need fine tuning but that doesn't mean the change is all bad. Before the change, clerics are more of a buff bot, nice but not really needed, in a fairly normal exp group. The equipment tanks were using from the expansions are giving them such an edge over the mobs that they require little healing. Now after the patch on AI, both the clerics and enchanters are now much more needed for a group. Is that really all that bad? I might be wrong on some aspect but thats what I've observe since SoV was launched.<BR>On a side note, if I didn't remember wrongly, they did mention before the patch that they are going to tune the NPC AI.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=181247" TARGET=_blank>~Areina~</A><BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR>High Priestess of Innoruuk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Personally, I think upping caster mobs casting power was a good thing, however in order to balance it properly, they should lower the melee power of caster mobs.<P>Originally caster mobs had insane melee abilities and hit points because their spell ability was relativly week.  Casters were still difficult because they could punch in the 50's or even 100's.<P>Now they have had their spell ability greatly increased, I think it's time for VI to tune their melee abilities.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28272" TARGET=_blank>Badany Greatheal</A><BR>Templar of the Prime Healer Rodcet Nife<BR>Zebuxoruk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Actually, those mobs that casts too high level spells now most likely COULD do it before, it's just that the AI wasn't smart enough to pick the better spells. I know that I've fought cleric mobs in the past that has mixed retribution, smite and wrath...not exactly smart behaviour.<P>It would've been better if they'd fixed the AI earlier on instead of giving mobs higher level spells than they could normally cast...but that's not how it went.<P>By the way, Brownie Guards in Lesser Faydark are behaving very weird right now. They stop as if they were about to cast their dot/dd /root spells, but they never actually cast them. Seems like the AI changes weren't bug free, either. :-)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>This is my take from a non-cleric viewpoint.<P>Clerics are already the most needed class bar none for a guild that likes to do raids.<P>Now clerics just became an essential part of an experience group into ANY dungeon that has caster mobs.<P>15 classes in EQ, yet one class is needed per every 5 other people to enjoy the game "as intended"; where in EQ's original sign up sheet did I read this prior to making my character?<P>Yesterday my L60 with 30+ aaxp monk died in Chardok after being rooted and chain nuked by 2 casters; I must say it was fun and surprised me a little because that has not happened to me for long time now. However, why not limit these changes to selected, difficult zones such as the current form of CT? Heck, upgrade Mistmoore to L46-60 zone and give them all the appropriate spells and I don't have a problem with it. But when you can't get a perfect group complete with crowd control, evac, clerical healing people should still be able to gain experience at an acceptable rate. As it stands, unless you have an enc/pal to stun and a cleric to heal expect to lose random groupmates from 1-2 high level DD.<P>I love clerics, heck my best in-game friend plays a cleric and my wife has an L60 cleric as well but I think this is going way too far.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Dont people have resists?  Sure you get casted on a lot more, just means you have to up your resists some.<P>I think the biggest complaint is that it makes the game harder with ZERO reward.  VI's risk vs reward concept is very skewed.  Instead of killing a lvl 50 mob for all of 4 gold that took a full group to kill, you now have a MUCH greater chance of getting killed (and losing exp/time) than before.<P>This is obviously just one more thing VI threw into the game to slow people down.<P>[This message has been edited by By-Tor (edited 06-10-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by By-Tor (edited 06-10-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I'm about to take a long leave from the game.  I really hated the last patch.  Hated the way they did focus items, hate the way they implemented the caster AI.  Plus, it seems like in the last few months experience has been getting nerfed in places like HS and Hole, where I used to hunt a lot.  <P>I think the focus items and caster mob tuning can be good things and add to the game, but the way they did it was just ill thought out.  We are beta-testing for them.  Let the people on the test server do that, that's what they're their for.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Borrowed from EQcastersrealm, which was in turn borrowed from the Developers Corner.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR><BR>As Alan's already said, the driving idea behind these changes to NPCs is to make them more interesting to fight. Previously, especially toward the high end, it's no secret that many caster NPCs were considered free targets. They spent the majority of their time casting ineffective spells, and frequently the same ones over and over again. <P>Originally, they were given exemptions to the normal spellcaster rules to make up for their shortcomings. It only makes sense that the average NPC should be a challenge for the people who can gain experience from its demise. However, we think it should instead feel like they're playing from the same rulebook as player spellcasters. <P>Making them challenging within a similar framework to the one that players use, we feel, provides for more rewarding victories. Conversely, let's face it, the argument, "Of course NPCs cheat -- They're NPCs." really doesn't make anyone feel better when they've just gotten themselves obliterated. Yes, dying is painful, but doing so in a fair fight is much more tolerable. <P>None of this is an attempt at "Making EverQuest Universally Harder." We'd like our NPCs be a little smarter than they were previously, yet an encounter with them should still feel challenging, but fair. <P>In last week's patch we introduced a significant enhancement to the "Challenging" half of that, which from observations on the Test server appeared to be mostly fair. However, we feel confident enough in the NPCs' newfound strengths that we've taken a look at some of the special bonuses that they get just for being an NPC. <P>With that in mind, we've internally tested some changes to address the "Fair" half, and they'll be available for public testing on the Test server over the next few days, in the hopes of reaching a balance between player and spellcasting NPC. Ideally, we would like to have a balance which leaves them a challenge; something to be mindful of, but not inordinately unfair. <P>There are some that we're still internally debating, but we all agree that we'd like to see them in action in front of a wider audience before we make any final decisons. <P>NPCs are now bound by the same Line of Sight rules as player characters. (An NPC must be able to "see" you to hit you with a spell.) <BR>  <BR>Neither NPCs nor player characters will use mana on targeted spell casts that do not connect due to Line of Sight. <BR>  <BR>NPCs are now bound by spell casting distance rules. Meaning, an NPC's spell will no longer connect from halfway across the zone. (We want spellcasters to be challenging -- Not a deathtrap that a person has no ability to run away from.) <BR>  <BR>NPCs now have a chance to be interrupted by normal combat when casting newer spells. <BR>  <BR>NPCs that are extremely green have had their potential casting damage reduced using a similar mechanic to the one that player characters' level differences use. <BR>  <BR>NPC Wizards no longer have an inherent bonus to their fire and cold based spells. They appear to be doing just fine on their own. <BR>  <BR>Most NPCs that had previously had their spellcasting level inflated to make up for poor spell selection have been brought back into line with their actual level. <BR>  <BR>NPCs no longer automatically get free access to rarely dropped spells, such as Garrison's Superior Sundering and Funeral Pyre of Kelador. <BR>  <BR>We've begun looking at NPC pure caster hit points and melee damage, and will continue to watch how this plays out over the coming weeks, making adjustments in some cases. Some adjustments are already visible on the test server. <BR>Even this balance may not yet be where we'd like it, but please rest assured that it will continue to be tuned. Most of us enjoy playing the game as well, and what we would like to see in our own playtime is NPCs that are a reasonable challenge. <P>- Scott Hartsman<P><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Summary - NPC casters received certain bonuses for having limited spell selections.<BR>Now that the spell selections have been increased, those bonuses will need to be tuned and "balanced" for the level of difficulty of the encounter.<P>  <BR><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78916" TARGET=_blank>Aalamdara A'shani</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.darkblood.com" TARGET=_blank>Darkblood</A> <BR><I>Solusek Ro</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">
