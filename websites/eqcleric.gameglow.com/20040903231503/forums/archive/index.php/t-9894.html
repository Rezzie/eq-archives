All spawns back to the drop are pulled within the respawn time, so we are basically sitting around waiting on monsters to show up.<br />
<br />
I break out the Poison Wind Censer to have a laugh meleeing the critters, and ask the enchanter for a haste buff.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I do not encourage clerics to melee. If you want to do damage use a DD.&quot;<br />
<br />
WHAT?!?!?! As if we are not killing these mobs FAST ENOUGH?!?! What an arrogant arse. He was goofing off charming mobs and pulling, letting his pets fight, but in his mind I had to sit and med and shut up like a good little robot cleric.<br />
<br />
This was almost a week ago and I'm still mad about it...<br />
<br />
Ohh I'm steamed.<br />

I always wield either dawnfire or ykesha mace. I have yet to have an enchanter or shaman refuse me buffs. I generally don't ask until like you said - the room is broken and there are not likely to be any surprises. But even if I asked at beginning that would still piss me off  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

They're also usually the ones who have to be reminded to cast clarity, who whine when you don't give them an AC buff, and who generally tend to treat other group members like retarded monkeys.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Sorry - I have issues with snobs, be they enchanters or anything else.<br />
<br />
I would have /shrugged and meleed anyway.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Enchanter &quot;Could I have some Ac/Hp buffs please?&quot;<br />
Thistleburr &quot;Sorry, I do not encourage enchanters to get hit&quot;<br />

NOTE: he did NOT say 'you can't melee' he said 'Don't ask me to burn mana that I might need so you can melee'  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
To me there is a difference.  Are we never guilty of saying &quot;Get stuffed you don't need it&quot; when Caster X asks for symbol, even though he offers a reagent?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Devil's advocate here, but hey.</div></div><hr />

Usually something along the lines of &quot;Thanks, I have 230 periodots on me already, but I need the 350 mana at the moment a lot more than you need the buff.&quot;  =)<br />
Depends on the situation.<br />
