<br />
Then the Wildrunners of Norrath might be the guild for you. Most of our raiding is done on the weekends with the week being devoted to exping, tradeskilling, or questing. We of course encourage raid attendance, but it is by no means required. <br />
<br />
Our primary targets right now are Kunark epic mobs, old school planes, and Velious mobs. Obviously if you have your heart set on getting into Plane of Time as quickly as possible, we aren't the guild for you. However, if you just want to relax with friends and maybe see some older content you'd missed the first time around, you might find us a good fit.<br />
<br />
