We are a european guild currently in Phase 5 of Plane of Time seeking commited players.<br />
<br />
www.curseofeternity.org<br />
www.curseofeternity.org/forum<br />
<br />
Requirements are level 65 in all cases, and we also want high attendance players. We raid every day. <br />
<br />
If you are transfering from another server, you can do so with all coin and equipment. To do this, follow this link:<br />
<br />
https://store.station.sony.com/eq_local_cmo...glish/index.jsp<br />
<br />
<br />
At present we are actively seeking: Several clerics, 1 wizard, 1 bard<br />
<br />
In detail wants:<br />
<br />
Clerics - High - 60% + attendance needed<br />
Necromancers - very low 70% + attendance needed<br />
Bards - Moderate - 50% + attendance needed<br />
Enchanters - very low - 70%+ attendance needed<br />
Beastlords - very low - 70% + attendance needed. <br />
Wizards - Moderate - 70% + attendance needed<br />
Rangers - Moderate - 70% + attendance needed.<br />
Shamen - low - 80% + attendance needed.<br />
Warriors - very low - 80% + attendance needed<br />
Monks - very low - 70% + attendance needed<br />
Shadowknights - very low - 70% + attendance needed<br />
Paladins - very low - 70%+ attendance needed<br />
magicians - very low - 70% attendance needed<br />
Druids - low - 70%+ attendance needed. <br />
<br />
<br />
very low = we have no shortage and you would have to be an outstanding applicant to be considered. Elemental/Time flagged Hardcore players with lots of AA's with very high attendance will always be considered even if requirements are very low.<br />
<br />
In the case of warriors, to be considered you really have to be close to our existing members in gear. That means 9000+ hp buffed as a minimum. You should have all defensive AA's and hit point bosting AA's. If you are a Knight, we expect pretty much the same kind of thing as we do for warriors.<br />
<br />
Preference is given to people with most flags in all cases, but we do not insist on elemental flags except for classes marked as very low. <br />
<br />
Please post your application on the board or contact Aurore in game.<br />

<br />
You may want to also mention the fact that if you transfer to a Ubisoft server your account becomes a Ubisoft account instead of a Sony account. This leads to the fun of not being able to download any new expansions because Ubisoft don't allow it yet.</div></div><hr />

My cleric got stuck on there for exactly that reason, I now have to play another cleric because my original character is stuck on Venril.</div></div><hr />
