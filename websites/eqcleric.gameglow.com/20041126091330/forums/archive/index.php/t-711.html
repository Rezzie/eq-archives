If you are in the old continent, south karana aviaks, high hold keep for the 2 of you, and quite a few other places.  Kunark there are probably a few places you could hunt stuff.  Not sure of the level but right in Firiona V there are a bunch of spiders that the 2 of you could probably take out.  Dreadlands you could probably find some lower level stuff that you could take out.  Lots of places.  Although I would assume that a bard and a cleric would have a good opportunity to get into a group most anywhere you travel.<br />

A word of advice though. When your bard friend hits 32, make sure that the whole group doesn't start yelling &quot;ManaSong, ManaSong&quot;<br />
<br />
Bards can do much much more than this during battle, and a lot of them get burned out of just playing that one song just to please their group-mates, especially when they know that other songs may be more effective.<br />

I regularly group with a bard, and besides his annoying tendency to qoute KC and the Sunshine Band (shake your booty - Aaarg!!! hehe) in Groupsay, he knows his stuff. He only plays the Manasong between fights because there is so much more he can do during combat then sit in the back and emulate the INT Casters... he throws down on the MOB too while singing.<br />

I fought the spiders very close to the Outpost, down on the beach near the tunnel that leads to the outpost. This is a good spot to pull to because 1) It's close to a guard (down in the tunnel) 2) It has no wandering spiders, and 3) It has very minimal wandering KSers (drixies, pilgrims). Every once in a while one of the scouts will KS you, but it's rare. <br />
<br />
At 30 you should also be able to get in a Forest Giant group there with no problem, you just have to be careful when travelling up there, lots of drolvargs around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ospy</div><div class="date">07-29-2000, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep generally a bard should only be playing mana song in combat when the cleric is low on mana (and then you can still spin with one other song). Of course there are exceptions to the rule, For Example fighting the Maestro in Hate. He has an AOE Lifetap so a bard meeling him would probably be just counter productive (he would probably suck more of HPs than i could damage him  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ), may aswell be feeding mana to the clerics and wizards.</div></div><hr />

You can do the Giant fort in FM or if you have a small party sit near the zone to the lake and have someone pull to there. <br />
<br />
In the lake zone inside the Sarnak fort is fun. Also if you are on during off peak hours you can solo undead at the ruins near  a huge tower, or mill,you can't miss it, its a huge tower with metal ummm... protrusions rotating on it. Just be careful with the charbones alot of them have a high magic resist, and keep an eye out for wanderers.<br />
<br />
I may try Cazic my self as soon as i get to 31(hopefully next time I can sign on   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ). Never been there myself, but it sounds interesting.<br />

<br />
Before you say, thats impossible remember a couple of things.<br />
<br />
1.  It was about 2am on a Monday.<br />
2.  Only one group in the zone, 5 Clerics and a Paladin. =p<br />
3.  Yes it is possible to clear the entire house in Unrest.<br />
4.  Was the most fun I have ever had playing EQ.<br />
