<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balanar</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mainly VI's fault. They need to tell the &quot;Traders&quot; that only XX# of items can be seen in the &quot;sell&quot; window at one time.<br />
<br />
So far just trying to find a copy of &quot;Judgement&quot; took me 5 traders since 4 of them had 40+ items for sale(most of them being common spells for 50~100pp) and they high end items were in the last bag.<br />
<br />
Some of the people may be doing it so that you have to buy 8+ crap items just to get down to the good items but I'm going to Assume that 90% of the people just don't know and loaded up an alt with 8 10 slot bags to sell not knowing that only 30 can be viewed to be bought.<br />
<br />
Whats worse is that the item, spells, gems that you can't get to can still BE SEARCHED for using the /bazaar. You can find an Item in the /bazaar that you have be wanting for 8+ months but only to find out its item #60 in the traders bag and the trader is &quot;AFK&quot;. Thus he can't be reached to inform them of their error or to get the item from them without buying tons of items from them.<br />
<br />
Which makes you buy 1~2k in crap items/spells just to get down to what you want to buy.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong the system is great it just needs to be tweaked abit and/or making sure that poeple know all the rules.<br />
<br />
I havn't tried setting up anything with the /trader command so I don't know if they have any info when you start that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is nothing that tells you that only 30 items can be seen ;/    I had assumed that you could have full bags for sale, but quickly learned otherwise and reorganized my seller's inventory.  If you didn't try  buying from others, or see a note on the boards, you might now know.  It's a pain to reorganize too -- if you add more items in /trader mode, you have to leave and reenter to get the order shifted it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seamund Crushbane</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks that explains a bunch.  I kept finding items in the /bazaar search that just didnt show up on the trader.<br />
<br />
/em shakes his fist at aaldin and his 20pp lava rock</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bindol</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think of a few other irritating issues with the bazaar.  <br />
<br />
If someone buys something from a Trader, unless the trader hits End Trade/Begin Trade, the item still shows up in the search function.<br />
<br />
After a certain period of time, the Trader stops showing up altogether in the search function.  All those traders that stay logged on all night basically do nothing but contribute to lag all night long.<br />
<br />
Trader name search is not alphabetic.  When you are looking for one trader name out of 300 traders, it takes alot of scrolling to find the name.<br />
<br />
Search feature does not work all that well.  Some words entered will pull up 0 items even though there are 50 for sale.  Other words must have the first letter capitalized in order to pull anything up.<br />
<br />
Ok, thats all the complaints I can think of off the top of my head.  And with all those bugs, I still think the bazaar is the greatest thing to be added to the game since it went live (well ok, KEI is better).<br />

<br />
Also didn't realize that you don't show up after so long.  Guess no more overnight stints  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif  Not to mention all those items that did sell still showing up long after it was sold.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Max of Tunare</div><div class="date">07-30-2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I've bought things from a trader that had AFK turned on and it was no longer in the search. Pretty sure sold items no longer are found by search. On the other hand, they are NOT removed from the search results box. You have to 'Find' again.<br />
<br />
I agree about the traders being in alpha sequence. As it is searching for a trader is almost worthless.<br />
<br />
One thing I found out and don't know if it's documented. If you click on a heading in the search results box it will sort on that field. Such as price or trader. Not sure it's all that helpful, but sometimes if I see something that appears undervalued I check to see if that trader has other things that are undervalued.<br />
<br />
Also the other search criteria are applied even if you search by item name. Not sure how helpful that is, but if you go from looking for a 'cleric' 'scroll' to looking for 'obulous' and it doesn't find much, could be the other search criteria is eliminating other hits on the name.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bindol</div><div class="date">08-04-2002, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since posting my list of complaints about the bazaar, I've since noticed that the majority of them seem to have been fixed.<br />
<br />
I'm down to just two complaints about it.  Trader name sequencing and I'm now totally out of money.<br />
<br />
Wonder if I can get Verant to create a patch to drop a couple million plat in my bank account.<br />
