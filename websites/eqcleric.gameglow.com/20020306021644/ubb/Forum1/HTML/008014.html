</FONT><HR>I've played clerics since beta, and it's still my favorite class, but I have trouble explaining the frustrations of being a cleric to non-casters sometimes.  A friend of mine was bemoaning the fact that several high level clerics on our small server have quit, and asked me why clerics get so bitter at high levels (not all, but lots do).  I had trouble verbalizing the reasons in a way that I could make him understand, so I was hoping some of you could explain some of the things that have made you burnt-out or angry with cleric life. (I myself quit for 6 months and just came back to playing a cleric)  Thanks for reading this!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Several reasons.<P>We are pretty much the most linear class their is. Enc's, necros, shamans, druids and the lot all have a couple avenues of oppurtunities to them. For a cleric it's heal and buff. The only thing I've seen as a derivation from this for about the past 5 months is soloing in the Grey where dark blue (to level 60) mobs only have 5-6k hp and are undead. We can still only do them one at a time and the downtime is ridiculous but it's actually something.<P>About a year or so ago there was a cleric surgance. Back when rangers, necros, paladins, shadow knights, druids, and to some extent bards SUCKED they all seemed to have created clerics because everyone say us as the best class of all. Well.. couple months later what do we have? 4 clerics LFG at any point in a zone. I'm a 60 cleric and I can't often get a group to save my life.<P>Rezzes. We got a huge burden put on our head here, and it causes many clerics to go /role or /anon because we just simply get tired of people asking us. Then you get people who yell at you for not crossing 2 zones to rez them, etc and it leads to much of the same problem druids and wizards have with ports.<P>This ties into the second point, but we are the least exciting (in terms of interaction with the game) class their is. The maximum I will do in exp groups is 1 MoK per mob and an occasional CH, DL, or stun. We don't very much get the thrill of dealing damage or being in the fray of battle, etc.<P>Total vulnerability. There are 3 classes that still have NO method for casting infinite invises (to the best of my knowledge). Clerics, Monks, and Paladins. Yes, warriors, who were never even supposed to get spells, can invis themselves where we cannot (never understood this). Monks can feign to save their lives, and paladins stand a chance at killing something if it hits them. They also have LH and just as much stun and root power as we do not to mention lots more hp and ac and can much more easily run if they get in trouble. If we get attacked? Pray you regain your root and it isn't interrupted and it lasts long enough to run to a zone.<P>In summary, the overall fun of a class is it's flexibility. Monks deal good damage, but also have good damage avoidance and can FD. ENC's have the burden of mezzing but can charm and have fun soloing with pets and dots. I could continue explaining how each class have several things open to them, but the sad fact is, for the most part our linearity is our downfall.<P>Back when they were making EQ they had 2 spells, CH and Rez and they were probably trying to figure out how to put these in the game. They decided to give them both to us. Ever since, we were doomed to live a life of boredom.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>There's a ton of pressure on high level clerics. How do you tell a friend you don't feel like rezzing them right now? How do you leave a raid when you're light on clerics without feeling guilty? (No one cares when the necros or warriors or rangers log early). Eventually, you find yourself playing out of some warped sense of duty rather than for fun. That generally makes you pretty bitter, and usually leads to people quitting.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Aiien (edited 02-23-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree, the burden placed on clerics at higher levels starts to get at you.  I have ben unguilded for about 6 monthes, and I still am bitter to a point.  I was expected to be at every single raid, if I wasn;t I caught alot of flak.  20 clerics on the roster and i couldn;t miss a raid.  I play everyday, so that meant raiding every raid.  Burned me out so bad that I am still burned out.  <P>Hate it when a raid going sour is blamed on clerics.  Really annoyed me. <BR> <BR>So I been exping for the last 6 monthes.  Then i realized I was getting alt exp just so I could get more alt exp.  Cleric=retired at the moment.  Been playing  ranger, mage, and monk alts instead. <P>Being a good cleric is not easy.  The attention to detail and responsible starts to grind away at you.  Is not fun anymore.  Rarely see bad clerics retire.  I am in no way saying all unretired clerics are bad, just saying bad retire less than good.  I retired  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> for now anyways.  So I guess some bad do retire.  <P>------------------<BR>Baroness Kornaena D'Lez<BR>Dark Elven High Priestess<BR>Mith Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Boy, you all hit it on the head.  The pressure and the monotony.   There's so much downtime for clerics just sitting doing nothing.  And pressure to raid, res, CR.  That's why my cleric is no longer my main.  <P>In fact, in my guild most of our clerics are second computer clerics (we call them bots).  People got sick of playing them and turned to meleers and tow along their own cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>I started a Cleric back in 1999 for role-play reasons (playing the fervently religious applealed) and because I realised I wanted to play a lynchpin role in any group. After hitting the 50s I suffered some EQ burnout and took 8 months off. I am back now but devoting far more time to my alt Enchanter than my Cleric.<P>Why?<P>For the reasons articulated above - Clerics are just too linear, we have a few basic group only functions and outside this context are almost crippled.<P>Which has lead me to the conclusion that we are the unfinished class of EQ. Why do we have such thin spell lists and no other special skills at all?<P>I compare to my enchanter who has a group function as necessary as Clerics AND gets a variety of magick that is useful in all sorts of situations.<P>I feel that the Cleric class lacks imaginative class design. Anyone agree? I still wonder at the enormous flexibility of the Enchanter as opposed to the Cleric.<P>I have always valued this forum though, I salute all those whose advice I have been able to put to good use. Just don't expect any royalties - I have invested all my funds in a Peridot mine.<P>Inquisiter<BR>55th Martyr of the most August Church of Tunare<BR>Brell<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>"Eventually, you find yourself playing out of some warped sense of duty rather than for fun."<P>Aiien hit the nail on the head in my case.  I got so burnt out having to be on everyday for every single raid.  And it wasn't because I was being pressured by the guild, I was pressuring myself out of that 'warped sense of duty.'<P>It has gotten alot better of late since we added 2 other raidable clerics and a third who was missing for a bit is back.  Now hopefully I can go back to just playing for fun.<P>As far as the limited role of being a buffer/healer/rezzer only.  I don't see this as a problem.  If I wanted to play a healer with other roles, I'd play a druid.<P>Bindol Stonehealer<BR>Vicar of Blackwing (Sol Ro)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I agree with several of the points already stated. <BR> <BR>  Finding a group is near impossible.<BR>  Soloing for exp is an absolute JOKE.<BR>  Raids are very dependant on us, so there is pressure there (this one doesn't bother me, I love raiding)<P>  Friends asking for rezzes at inopportune times can sometimes be hard to say no (thank god I don't have any friends  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> )<P>The only thing I haven't seen listed here (unless I missed it) was the pressure we (or at least I) feel when actually performing my job.  If someone dies...I feel responsible.  Even if there was nothing I could do to save them, I still feel that sense of responsibility, and I often replay what happened in my mind to try to see if I could have done something different.  Most of the time there was simply NOTHING I could do to save them.  But every now and then I know I made a mistake that cost them their lives.<P>There is no other class like this.  We really are critical to the success of raids and even some exp groups.  I know this may sound silly..after all we can rez them.  No big deal.  Well, sometimes it IS a big deal...either to the player that died, or to the actual raid.<P>If anything would make me quit playing a cleric...it would be this.  But this is also the very thing that keeps me playing the class I do.  We are a very specialized class, and people need us.  We might not always get the praise or thanks for what we do...but the very fact that all those pressures exist should reaffirm that we are needed.<P>I find the people that quit playing a cleric really never liked the class to begin with.  Nothing wrong with that...they should find where they fit in the whole game.  Makes everyone happier.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Arele" TARGET=_blank>Arele Nyxx</A> - <BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org" TARGET=_blank>Afterlife</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I've played Bala for 132 days now, and retired her two weeks ago.  For all the reasons stated above.  <P>I loved the class, but don't particularly care for the narrow role that Verant has put us in.  Out of a spellbook full of spells I only ever use 8.  And spells are our compensation for less loot.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>I love my guild, but I just can't stand doing a CH group anymore. I rarely got to see a mob alive; always healing from around the corner or in another room.<P>After awhile it became an obligation instead of a game.  I decided that was enough, and switched to my war alt as my main.<P>Problem is, we're so short on clerics, I end up playing my Bala on certain raids still. It's really hard to establish myself in my new identity if the old one still shows up on raids.<P>I disagree that people who quit didn't like the class in the first place.  I'd play bala again if we had some variety in our roles.

</FONT><HR>Its tough to be sure.<P>No one notices if a paladin doesn't make a raid.  Some days I feel like skipping a raid and saying "hey just put me on the paladin loot rotation if my missing a raid is going to blot my record".<P>A clerics job is pretty thankless in terms of rewards.  A lot of the times you are busting your ass and it seems like the whole point is just to equip a guild full of melee so that they don't even need a cleric to go exp anymore.<P>If you don't enjoy raiding as a cleric as an end in itself you might as well give up on the class right away.  The bragging rights on the equipment you get (that doesn't REALLY improve you all that much) will only carry you so far.  At the end of the day you either like raiding as a cleric or you will burn out and quit.<P>On the plus side, good solid clerics are key to taking down the fun high end stuff.  And the personal satisfaction of being part of a winning team and doing your part I think is very worthwhile.<P>I still enjoy raiding a lot.  I enjoy cleric'ing a lot.  But I can see why others would burn out.  Trying to get exp as a cleric stinks and if you don't enjoy raiding as one....<P>I've been very proud of my guild in its ability to keep clerics around.  We've lost maybe 3 or 4 clerics in the least YEAR since I have joined.  Which given the high burnout rate of the class is really quite incredible.<P>Brambodius Tanglefoot<BR>Lotus Cult - Quellious<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>1. It is harder than it was before to get into groups! Enter Velketor's or Sebilis and you'll already see a couple Clerics LFG.<P>2. It gets monotonous healing and buffing, casting MoK and MoR, Rezzing... etc<P>3. Items are limited. It's harder to obtain really, really great items for Clerics than it is for Melee'rs. It seems the game is Melee based anyways, and most mobs have A LOT of melee gear that drops. Rarely see too many Cleric item mobs. <P>4. No Invis =(   I have to purchase a couple Invis potions from Vendors at 13pp each. I can't find paying for a Gnomish Vanishing Device. Although it would be nice to have.<P>5. Can't SOLO! Especially at level 60. It's not worth the effort and time. I can solo 2 blues with one full mana bar, if I'm lucky, in The Grey. Or solo Wyvern's in Cobalt Scars that are light blue. Then, mana regen is too slow. Maybe if I had Blessed Armor of the Risen and some Flowing Thought Items, soloing would be more feasible.<P>6. No items with an Effect that really helps us out. Except for maybe Sacrifice that drops off Lord Yelinek (Cannibilize 2). No other items I know of have a right click DD or DoT.<P>I personally enjoy playing my Cleric though. I like the responsibility of keeping everyone alive in my group, rezzing during Raids. I have fun by Nuking and Stunning from time to time. I also like having the most powerful and useful Epic in the game =)<P><P>------------------<BR>Gravewalker<BR>60 High Priest<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=49075" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The monotony, the stress.  When I play the cleric- I cant look away from the health bars .  On long raids, it was incredibly boring- staring at the floor or the wall.  I never knew when a mob died.  Four hours of that was the pits.<P>Also- the number of times people blame the CLERIC for things going bad.  How about the puller for doing a bad pull? The melee for not assisting or managing their aggro? The nuker for nuking too early and pulling the mob into camp?  Poor mob positioning by the main tank? Crappy strategy by the raid organizer? Crappy planning (pc's too low low level, not enough of needed classes)?<P>But noo- the cleric missed the heal. (And this is observations from raids I have attended where I DID NOT play my cleric- so no I wasnt overly sensitive) /boggle.<P>I love my cleric.

</FONT><HR>The the thing that contributes to cleric burn out the most, at least in my case, is the fact you can never really relax.  I have played my cleric for over 200 days, am in a raid guild, we raid every day for the most part. This weekend I decided to play a 58 Warrior i have access to for a Tunare run.  It took us 6 hours to clear all of Pog and I actually had fun.  I could walk away and get a drink, go to the bathroom without thinking, hurry hurry.  On my cleric, I always have to make sure I am there because of the constant pulls.<P>I also agree that in terms of loot there really isn't much out there for clerics.  Getting a reward every now and than or having something to shoot for would be nice.<P>I wish they had given us Bash or some fun aa skill that revolved around only us, like the shaman rabid bear.  Our epic is raid based, all our aa skills are raid based.  At this point in the high lvl game there isn't much use for a cleric in an exp group, you just slow the process down.  I went to Seb with a 56 Bst Lord, 60 Shaman, 60 Druid and 60 Cleric, we did Chef area, I never had to heal.  Oh well I think this is just our class, we will always be a main stay in raids.<P>Mariaa Allen<BR>60 Cleric<BR>Xegony<BR>Inner Circle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I've hit the burnout once already with my cleric in the early 30s... mainly because I found single-pulls for hour after hour in Overthere to be mind-numbingly boring.  So, I parked my cleric for a day or two and played my level 6 troll SK twink (he's not afraid of much in da swamp anymore).  For me, the key to avoiding burnout has been to get out and see other places, don't do the exp grind more than 2 days in a row in the same zone, grab guildees and go visit a far off zone, or play an alt that has none of the stress.  Last night after being on a 5 hr raid in the morning, I wandered from South Ro, to Freeport, to High Pass, to North Karana, down to Rathe Mountains (ended up doing the Temple of Ro bracer quest).  Ended the evening doing HGs with guildmates.<P>I've already started having the dreams about missed heals (gah!).  Once I start using CHeal more regularly, I'm sure the stress level will rise (as I have to play the timing game even more).  A cleric gets no downtime!  On the hole raid yesterday I had to watch my group, plus keep an eye on the main tanks and the enchanter in the other groups.  <P>OTOH, I love dungeon crawling and raid crawling, preferably when the pullers are bringing 2-3 mobs back to the camp at a time and I'm doing more than GHeals at the end of a pull.<P>I still love the class, but I have tasted the possibility of burn-out.  My goal is to keep things varied on a day-to-day basis.<P>------------------<BR>Corish, Level 38 High Elf Cleric of Morell-Thule<BR>Vorish, Level 27 High Elf Magician of Morell-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>When I look at my played time on my cleric I think I must be insane (243 days last I checked - who knows now) - but at the same time I wouldn't change classes for anything in the world.<P>The linear monotony of buff, med, heal, repeat doesn't get to me much.  I'm very involved in my guild and what we do/raid. (Co-leader of our guild) Most of what I do in game revolves around raids.  I don't have problems with being asked to rezz and am in fact rarely asked to come perform a rezz for someone.  Getting a group is sometimes difficult, but I group pretty exclusively with guildmates, so even this is a minimal problem.<P>Raids would have to be the biggest frustration as a cleric.  Not enough clerics on?  Clerics need to log early?  Raid gets called off, clerics get guilt-tripped, raid becomes more difficult and/or fails, etc.  <P>A cleric mis-times a CH or makes a small error?  Someone could die and affect the raid in a negative manner.  Its not always the fault of the cleric when something goes wrong - but sometimes it is.  <P>There are so many ways that a cleric can make or break a raid that it definately is high pressure.  Probably why I love it.<P>------------------<BR>Sirensa the Vicar <BR><A HREF="http://hossguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Hoss</A><BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Gotta agree with the frustration aspect ; I was in Katta with a 55 pally friend of mine ; We went to the graveyard and he con'd the undead there and found they were light blue to him. I thought "Great!" I can bring my cleric here and have a good ole time killing undead , pick up some xp, and also wait for Coterie assassins for him for a quest he was doing.(My cleric is 51 ; I had been there with my 45 ranger killing the undead and they were solid blues ) I get my cleric from Oasis to Katta, make an undead pop, and tada! light blue!  A few blasts later with Banish undead and its toast..Check the xp bar..no noticeable movement..Oh well I think..Will try some more..Tried 3 more...No xp movement..Oh I got xp (at least it said I did) but no movement AT ALL..  So at this point, I'm oom and bummed, as the whole trip to Katta was a bust, and took a while to get there only to find out the xp was nil.. I med up and am walking back to the zone, and here the "Clerics like you have ruined your lands..!" spiel and a coterie assassin jumps me (well I WAS camping him for my friend..He is blue and undead...This should be ok, eh?)<P>NOPE...Dunno if any of you have fought one of these guys , but in the span of 15 seconds he drained my blood 4 times and I was at 1 1/2 bubs of health real fast..I root him, and back off, casting Epitaph of Life on him, while using my donal arms to heal up..He breaks root, I reroot and back off, tossing a couple banishes on him..Looking good,eh? Root breaks..Reroot..root breaks..reroot...root breaks...reroot...Heal self as just got my butt handed too me from all those roots breaking..Root breaks..Banish..Resisted..Reroot..back off med...60% mana..wow, root HELD for once..Walk a bit towards vampyre..Notice health is FULL..Root breaks...Reroot, Jboots..Zone...    Log out frustrated...At 51 , I cannot even solo 1 coterie assassin effectively...Maybe I was just having a bad night with the random number generator favoring the Coterie..But more and more I end up playing my alts.. People only want my cleric for raids, or "xp camps" where they do not want to rely on thier own healing. <P>I have a friend that plays a cleric and is 56th lvl ; He specialized in Evoc long ago, and has had issues grouping , as he tells them he is an evoc specialist..However, he can definately "solo" undead far more effectively than me (He can kill 3-4 spectral keepers easily without medding between) and he still has all the cleric heals/buffs..His heals are just not as efficient as mine<P>Sorry for the ramble..My point I guess is , the frustration burns alot of us out..Went through the burnt out phase in my clerics late 30's and now it seems they are back in the early 50's..<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>gee looks like its GREAT to be a cleric... wait not really..  I've gotten my cleric to lvl 35 but seeing all of this negative crap about them sorta makes me wanna quit and not waist my time on him...  Do any of you still like your cleric?  If not then stop playing them so there won't be so many clerics so those of us that DO like to play our clerics can get a group!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Our class is a catch 22. On the one hand we outshine all other healers to such a great extent we are the only option for most high end raids.<P>On the other, we're a one trick pony. We CH and... CH and occasionally res. CH is our definitive spell and it's also our bane. Every time we are evaluated, people take one look at CH, realize just how rediculously overpowered it is, and say we're good enough.<P>We've been handed 3 unique spells of any real use since EQ was expanded.<P>The Celestial Line - Finally, an alternative to straight up healing!<P>Mark of Karn - Useful, nerfed, pseudo-unnerfed, semi-unnerfed. Moderately useful but still not much more than a parlor trick.<P>Mark of Retribution - A damage shield. A damage shield you cast on mobs! <B>A damage shield you cast on mobs that stacks with all other damage shields!!!!!!!!</B> I just about fainted when I realized this was something new AND useful.<P>So where did we go wrong? Well, it was SoV that started it really. With CH being so powerful, VI had to tailor mobs to be harder and thus be outside the reach of normal clerics. And thus was born the CH chain. You cast it on cue and keep the main tank alive. In other words, pretty much everything else we have is worthless.<P>So why the burnout? We've got the weight of EQ on our shoulders. We are the cornerstone of every group and raid. So we should all quit and make people appreciate us, right? Wrong. I'd say half of the clerics in EQ now are PLed twinks being run on second computers. They spam CH. Sure feels good to know all your knowledge and experience and means nothing and you can be replaced by a PLed cleric being played by a monkey who pushes a key every minute or so.<P>We have nowhere else to go. Verant won't give us a serious review, other classes already feel we're too powerful and won't support any expanded cleric abilities, and there's nothing else to do on raids but buff and cast CH. Look at our AA abilities. Our only true "class" abilities are a manaless HoT spell and a 60 game day 100% res.<P>Verant needs to take a serious look at clerics. Expand our melee to somewhere just below that of a hybrid so we can at least HIT SOMETHING. Give us some better nukes. Not the horribly inefficient Judgement but something that gets on par with Reckoning for mana efficiency. They need to do SOMETHING to give us incentive to play.<P>Should lower level clerics quit? Nah. If you're taking the slow path to 60 you'll be just fine. The twink clerics will zoom right past and you'll not see them until you hit at least 50.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> Burn out.. it comes and goes with me and my level 60 cleric with 200+ days played.  Main reason I get the "blues" is basically what is mentioned above about pressure to raid, rez, and attend, and to add to that the sometimes long waits for groups, and also the reluctancy at times, of other classes to lend me a hand... such as with ports, quests, invises, or sows.. yet when any of them need a rez first thing that happens is they do a "who all cleric", and look for the highest one in the zone.  <P>The whole set up for clerics was for us to be group based.. not RAID based.. The problem that we, and in my opinion, where Verant went wrong, was that too many of the same skills were given to too many classes.  Now in the end game, druids, shammies, pallies, and even necros can heal in most exp. group situations, and they have more to bring to the table in the way of soloing, and meleeing. Our only saving grace is our rez, that is only when something goes wrong.  Add to that Pallies, and necros can even do that and its importance is  slighted.  In the case of exp. grinding in fungus grove, even the almighty rez is normally not needed, since few deaths occur with any kind of competant group.<P>Our complete heal on raid situations is about the only thing that we have that comes into play that gets our class the status of being truly needed.  Unfortunately these raids may have 5 clerics or so on a ch rotation, and then the mob will drop some quest piece that can be used for all classes, but with a different end result, so IF it is a quest piece that a meleer needs for a new piece of gear, and lets see the melees out number the clerics by 3 to 1, then you can guess what the odds are of the cleric getting the drop.  There are some limited ways around this using various point systems, but even at that, the odds do not favor clerics.    <P>The twink factor is also abit depressing, as being an "original" cleric, I worked my tail off to where I am at now, and I see druids, warriors, etc, that twinked there cleric up to the mid 50s in half the time or less.. When I started my cleric a 50 percent rez was uber..  So now to summarize all this, I have my toon that has 200 plus days on it, that helped the newbies back when everyone was a newbie.. and now he competes for loot with twinks that became a cleric via powerleveling.  You guys getting the idea of frustration yet??   :  ) <BR>The good thing about being a cleric is the fact that we can be a deciding factor on raids as much or more so than any other class.. When it comes to tackling that uber mob, there are few ways around NOT having a cleric or two there..The other classes are important, but try and get a raid together to take down Klandicar, with out a couple of us around.  Not impossible, but very unlikely..Still doing a good job on an uber mob, or saving that tanks life when he was about to go under is what keeps good clerics playing.. at least that is what keeps me going. <BR>I know this is a long post, but I have been doing eq for a long time now, since its inception, and I do see some real shortfalls in our class.  I'm thru with the whine now.., so offer me some cheese.  :  )  <BR>Good luck to all you new clerics out there..<P>Dusklar 60th High Priest of Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have to say I think Boanerges hit the nail on the head. We are only examined in the context of CHEAL. This spell is not a boon it is a curse. I think it is really preventing any real revamp of the class. I am beginning to loathe that spell.<P>And I am interested to read that people are being passed over for exp group - that has happened to me a lot lately. All these lame easy high level exp grind zones - Maidens, Fungus etc have meant that a group with a post 55th Shaman or Druid perceives a Cleric as very optional.<P>Those easy zones in combination with the new 55th heals for those classes has really devalued Clerics. We have not degraded per se so much as other healers have been upgraded. It is a matter of context. <P>Sadly as one trick ponies we have no limited alternate avenues. Considering our poor mellee and lack of enchanter type pets (that Unswerving Hammer should have been like that) we are even denied the simple pleasure of doing slightly lower level quests or hunting greens easily.<P>It is especially insulting to run into the Cleric "bots" that high level guilds tend to run.<P>I will have to get back into the roleplaying aspect of the class thats were the fun lies.<P><BR>Inquisiter<BR>55th Malcontent of Brell<BR> <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I havent burnt out on cleric, very much doubt I will any time.  But clearly, from watching other clerics burn out, and from watching my own sense of 'getting tired of some things' i can tell you these are the major problems.<P>1) We're a one trick pony.  We buff, we heal.  In xp groups this is all we can do.  We get stuns, but chanters do it better.  We get nukes, but they are laughable.  We get weapons, but mana regen is more important.  We get MoK and its pointless. at least MoR is very useful if its a mob that's gonna die slowly. 225 mana, can add up to around 1000 dmg if its got a lot of HP.  that's nice.<P>2) On raids, we're even MORE limited to what we can do.  Mostly i'm talking about the complete heal rotation here.  A trained monkey can do this.  A macro can do this. people make BOTS to do this.  Let me show you.<P>Hotkey1:<BR>/Tar Cleric1 (lead cleric)<BR>/assist Cleric 1 (to get tank target)<BR>/sit off<P>Hotkey2:<BR>/paus XX (appropriate pause amount)<BR>/Cast X (complete heal number)<BR>/g Witty Message for Rotation<BR>/sit on<P>with the exception of tank switches, or being short on prop healers, its fairly simple.<P>3) the pressure to play is tremendous.  Pressure from friends who feel they 'need' you for groups.  Pressure from guildmates who 'need' you for a res.  Pressure from your guild or raid leader that 'need' you for that heal rotation.  This can add up to hours of online time that you would rather have spent logged off.<P>Now, I got it pretty good.  First, I play on test, not a lot of clerics there.  In fact, test is STARVING for clerics.  So i'm treated really well.  In addition, my guild is the most understanding people in the world.  If i cant make a raid, or simply dont want to be there, that's genearlly ok.  They've got a fair share of 'cleric bots' so occasionally its fine if i want to leave, check out, fall asleep, etc.<P>Secondly, I've got very understanding friends.  If i dont wanna 'drive' my cleric, one of my friends will bot him. Hell, he'll even get me xp sometimes.  On top of that, if i dont feel like playing or have other responsobilities, they suck it up.<P>So anyways, that's my post on why clerics burn out, hope it helps  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hrm, I have tons of fun with my Cleric.. I love Raiding, and I love Xps grouping.  <P>Keys to having fun as a cleric?<P>1. In xps groups load Stun, and stun command, Help with the Crowd Control.<P>2. In xps groups, LIVE in dungeons.  We are much more fun/powerful in dungeons. Outside zones we become heal batteries.<P>3. Get Toys!!  I have a donnals bp (click CH), Templars Leggings (group heal), Donnals Boots (click AE 120 damage), Dawnfire Morningstar of light(procs 585 and I have 150 dex)<P>4. Try irrigular group combos..  Dont always need the standard war, cleric, enc. gg. blah blah.  Heck try some other combos like 3 necro groups<P>5. Get a 2nd PC and another eq account. Network them and whola.. I have a SK twink I play with when I cant find a group, or that I solo when on raids during downtime.<P>6. Dont let yourself feel like you NEED to do anything.  Its your game, have fun.  If you dont feel like raiding all the time, join a more relaxed guild. OR (against the EULA) Find 2-3 Real good friends and Make them play your cleric when you have to camp =).<P>7. If no 2 computers, I would suggest a twink to go to once a week atleast.  Just to get a diverance =)<P>8. Get in a good guild with people you really like/love.<P><BR>Brenen Lifegiver<BR>60 High Priest of Brell<BR>Veeshan Server<BR>The Circle of Eternity<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Fizzle a CH in a chain can equal dead Main Tank and possibly wipeout.<P>Get a tell from goodfriend01 that they died in the permafrost bear pits while your in sirens groto running for your life trying to make it to WW zone without sow as the druid that ported you over last night gave you avian and you had to use both inuvulns to get past those blasted charming sirens.<P>Zone into sebilis hoping for a night of exping for that "last blue bubble" and find 3 OTHER clerics also LFG and higher level / epic'd.  Drink your thurg gate potion and run to Velks only to realize that there are 66 people in the zone and the ONLY mob that lives more then .02 seconds is Lord Bob.<P>Take the spires up to Luclin where you lag horribly, have no clue where your going, and once you DO get to Fungus grove the group waiting on you needs to "take a 10 min break" that lasts 2 hours.<P>Join an awesome exp grinding group with wonderful friends and good fun in Howling Stones, only to have to AFK every 15 minutes to be a good mommy.<P>Log on to exp to get that death buffer only to have a raid force looking to you to show your guild support.<P>Though despite all these things, some clerics still flourish.  Our guild clerics are treated the best.  We do get lots of armor and goodies as fast as melee do.  We do get lots of support and help when needed.  BUT the pressure does kill, thankfully when all this builds up to the breaking  point, I know to stop and go play a twink, go read a book, go watch a movie, go outside and blow bubbles.<P>Every class has its ups and downs.  Some happen early in the game, others at the end.
