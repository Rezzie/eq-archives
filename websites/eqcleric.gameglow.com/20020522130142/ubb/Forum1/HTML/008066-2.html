</FONT><HR>Shieze is correct to a degree in that skilled, veteran clerics really shine in their abilities.  However, most any raid can get by with 'bot clerics or second-boxed clerics.  I would hazard to guess that most every advanced guild on any server has people 'log in' cleric 'bots as needed.  Sure, those 'bots don't have the quick reactions and fluency with our little tricks as they might be, but for most rotation mobs, any monkey can play a cleric, and as long as there are a few skilled clerics in the mix, the raid will go just fine.<P>As for XP groups, we CAN operate quite well, but we are far from the efficient choice for most level 60 XP grinders.  Why would a warrior want to partner with me, when he could have a shaman to buff, slow, debuff and DOT?  We aren't necros, whos ability to solo merits a reduced effectiveness in grouping situations.  Of the three 'healer' classes, Clerics are the WORST soloers, and now can be said to be the least effective of the three in most AA XP situations. <P>And no one can deny that all casters are screwed when it comes to equipment upgrades.  Give a warrior a sword with a better ratio and you've directly improved what he is.  Flowing thought items are hardly the same degree of improvement for clerics.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I still would like to point out one thing...<P>Yes we're the best HP healer.  yes we're the best AC and HP buffer.  That's great, too  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>However, if a monk is solo'ing blue mobs at 60, we simply cannot bring enough to the table to make them want us to join in.<P>We reduce downtime: But for most 60's there is little to no downtime for the melee's.  Regen items, AA skills, huge ac, huge hp total... all of these things make 'HP Buff' and 'AC Buff' and 'Heal U' seem stupid.  Even if they kill a whopping 20% faster, they're still splitting it 2 ways... it just doesnt calculate.<P>We BUFF:  yeah, so?  One cleric in a zone will often sell an aegolism to the soloer's anyways.  What SK is going to agree to split xp with you for an aegolism, when the cleric who is grouped with her friends will sell him one for 100 plat?<P>We Heal:  Almost inconsequential.  This only reduces downtime, and there is so little for the right people who have the right gear and levels and skills to solo.  Just not gonna happen.<P>We Nuke: you sir, are a moron.  No we dont. Our spells have +MR to resist checks.  On top of that, the mana ratio and damage is way out of line.  at 60, our best nuke is 750, even if it does land during the fight, we generally dont have enough time to recast it a second time.  If the mob we're fighting has 3500 hp, that is basically nothing... and if we resist... good god, its just plain sad.<P>Even our undead nukes have this problem.<P>We can MoR: Yeah, pretty useful, especially with the 2-3 person group going on.  15 point damage shield, if the mob swings 2 times every 3 seconds, lands 50% of its hits, then we do 15dmg x 20 = 300 damage for 225 mana.  Uh, yay?  Scale this damage up, or for the love of god, at least make it unresistable.  This is a great spell however, its in the right line of thinking.<P>We Can Melee: We run out of mana, and our melee is horrible.  Even with Our epic, or a nice ssra Rhag weapon.  It just doesnt cut it.  up our blunt to 250, and at least we can hit the stinking thing.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'm not arguing against clerics getting better nukes  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"> I wouldn't mind them!!! However, I don't know where you are hunting that you have such high resist rates on your nukes, but mine seem to land just fine. And I do nuke, whenever I have extra mana!<P>Also, our most mana efficient nukes do 2.68 dam/mana. Compare to 3.2 for Druid's best. Compare CH and the Celestial line to Druid and Shaman heals, whose best heal only yields 2.2 hp/mana. <P>I don't think we're in as bad shape as some of you make out...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Tabb<BR>The bulk of your argument compares how we team up as a "Duo" class. Where 2 people go out and fight. The counter arguemnt would be ... Does a SK want to team with a Wiz ? Magi ? Druid ? if not , maybe they need to fix that.<P>While they are at it a team of Enchanter, and Wiz arn't that good, and thus they need to fix that too. See my point ... it's not really a valid argument when discusing "Duo" teams... Some classes match up well and others don't.<P>They (SOE) will focus on balance in a full group. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>They (SOE) will focus on balance in a full group.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Considering there are fifteen classes and only six of them can be present at most in a group at any given time, I certainly hope that this isn't the only approach to class balance.  I don't care to be pigeonholed into what I'm expected to do as the sixth person added to a standard reference group.<P>I think that looking at what a class adds to various duo's is actually a very valid approach to class balance.  If clerics add similar value no matter which other one class they're grouped with, druids add similar value no matter which other one class they're grouped with, enchanters...  and so on.  If that's true, then I'd say classes are pretty well balanced, probably for groups of six in most cases as well as for groups of two.<P>I actually expect Verant not to use either model, though.  They'll probably develop a reference model of what each class should be able to do, ignoring group synergy entirely, crunch some numbers, and tweak a small amount based on the result.  I don't expect any changes of substance, to be honest.<P> - Chronomis<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I dont agree with alot of the suggestions here.<P>The hammer is a joke, dont improve it so its a druid pet ( that pet is a joke as well ) I could care less if that spell is removed totally, its a fun toy but not what a cleric needs for balancing.<P>Soloing, I dont understand why so many people want the ability to solo. nukes, dots and undead nukes are so situational that they will only ever be used when solo'ing imo. I think that its a waste to upgrade them when looking to balance clerics. The only advatage of this would mean when 2 clerics are in the group one of them isnt totally useless.<P>invs, getting killed by green cons and agro issues is a valid concern imo. I would like either a self only invs or 10 charge invs potions. I would also like to be able to melee lvl 40 mobs and have no chance of dying and kill them easily, maybe the melee ability of a lvl 40 monk (not sure what the dmg output of a pally is, but well under what they do) maybe adding double attack at lvl 60  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I'd rather have that than a stupid hammer pet.<BR>rogues have evade, rangers have jolt and monks have FD. Why not have a similar ability for clerics to get rid of a little agro?<P>an upgrade to the epic where the person rez'ed is full mana full health and aego'ed  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> maybe make it cost 2 dots per use or something (maybe a little powerful lol)<P>maybe a CE to end all CE's 15secs of CH each tic, casting time 15seconds or something 600m<BR>recast 5mins or something<P>Alyia<BR>59 cleric<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Tabb:<BR><B>For 55+ clerics please.<P>During the revamp of the casters....<P>1) What do you think most needs to be changed for clerics and their class?<BR>2) Which classes do you feel need an upgrade?<BR>3) Which classes do you feel are 'just right' ?<BR>4) if you could personally choose one thing for clerics to gain/lose etc... what would it be?  Top of the list choice here   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I'm going to go ahead and post anyway, even though you said only 55+ clerics only =)<P>1) Clerics need more diversity in their role.  They heal good, they buff good, but goddamnit, healing and buffing are boring.  MoK and MoR are along the right lines- clerics need more of that. (make it so whenever a mob hits it gives an AE minor heal?  I dunno)  Make the cleric pet a real pet.  Also- I'd like to see a 2k hp heal.<P>2) All pure casters, other than Wizards, need an upgrade.  Currently, casters are comparable to their old world level 50 max counter-parts.  We have more mana and our spells scale up the same exactly as they always have in pre-kunark EQ.  Melees, however, play an *entirely* seperate game.  Imagine a level 50 cleric with a Mithril BP and a CGS and whatever that Kith hammer is and GEB's and yellow gauntlets, maybe some purple armor too walking into Velks and start looking for a group.  Now imagine a level 50 warrior walking into Velks with a pair of Yak's and full bronze and a FBSS, maybe some hate armor too.  I don't really need to say more about that I don't think.<P>General things to fix- PURE CASTERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO DAMAGE ON RAIDS.  Wizzies can do this, as they should- other than that, all the other casters just sit on their butts in a corner our of the AE and wait for all the melees to say "woot"  Raids are as interesting as staring at a poorly textured wall.. BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE DO.  Mob's resistances are too high for us to nuke, unless you're a wizzie.  Wizzies are no longer the "king of direct damage"- they are the **only** direct damage. (in the context of raids)  Lower resistances of uber-mobs either through just having plain old lower resists or making better debuffs. (Hmm, dragon-bane Tash and Malo?)  No matter what, the various nukes/dots of shammies/necro's/clerics/druids/chanters/mages need to work on high level encounters.<P>All nukes should do more damage.  DoT's should be shorter duration and do more damage.  Melee's are doing 4-5 times as much damage as they did pre-kunark.  Caster damage spells do twice as much damage, at the very very best.  This is broken- there's no other way to say it.  Dots...  Fights currently don't last long enough for DoT's to be mana efficient.  An average fight lasts maybe 45 seconds, a minute... DoT's just don't do enough damage.  If these means mob's need to have more hp's to stand up to casters, so be it.  A mage or a wizzie or a necro ought to be a viable choice for adding damage to a group.  As it is, if you want more damage, you look for a monk, rogue or ranger.<P>We need more spell slots.  8 slots was just about right for the original context of pre-kunark EQ, but then, so were 8/24 short swords and 15ac plate breastplates.  When I'm XP'ing I Absolutely Must Have Tash, Mez, and 3 of my AE stuns loaded.  That leaves me 3 spots to swap between Slow, Cripple, all my chanter buffs, root, gate, mana-taps/sieves, charms, mem blurs, my nukes and my dots.  I cannot play my class to *nearly* it's full potential not because I don't have enough mana, not because I don't know how to play my class, but because I don't have enough spell slots.<P>Individual classes....<P>Clerics, see #1.<P>Druids... I'll go ahead and say it... need to heal better and need to buff hp's better. (ie, be more like clerics)  Druid's need to do everything they do currently, just do it better. (We don't make a lot of the products you buy, we make a lot of the products you buy.. better)  Druid's are gimped healers, they're gimped nukers, they're gimped dotters.  Everything they do can be done better by some other class, yet they are not a "generalist" class like a bard or pally that you can call in and not do your group a dis-service.  I also don't want some cleric coming and saying druid can be main healers for a group just fine... you're never been in a group with a druid as a main healer =P<P>Shammies need to heal a little better and nuke a little better, ala druids.  Other than that- they're good.<P>Necro's- Ugg, this will take a while.  Several nice improvements have been made for necro's recently... the group attack/ac buff/debuff leechs/spells whatever they are are nice.  Have the chance a spell gets resisted be identical to if it was cast on the necro- IE, if a necro has a 75% chance of resisting AE_Fire_00, give the pet the same 75% chance, so pets won't insta-poof on raids. (ie, are useful)  Make pets break off aggro if loses line of sight to the caster, to prevent pet trains.  Give pets the same movement speed as the owner, so they won't get lost and cause trains.  Fix pet pathing so they won't train as much.  Tweak how pets gain aggro to reduce the risk of training. (did I mention I don't like pet trains?)  Give necro's better heals.  Max hit points on player characters have gone up drastically since the necro heals were drawn up.  I've seen int casters buffed up to 4k hit points- Melee's to 6k.  Compare those numbers to the numbers EQ had when necro heals were drawn up...  Healing is an ability that Necromancers have lost since the various expansions have come out- they used to be very good at it, but they no longer are.  Think about that.<P>Mages... See all my pet gripes with necro's.  Pets cause trains, plain and simple.  On a raids, the only people you see with pets are the idiots who don't know better.  (Unless you're gonna wack Rak or something)  Mages used to pack some pretty impressive nukes- now they do what? half as much as wizzie nukes?  Classes like Mages and Wizzies should dish out comparable damage to mid-range melee, because that's what a group needs them to do- deal damage.  As it is, bards will outdamage a mage the majority of the time, something their class wasn't intended to do.<P>Wizzies- good.  Do a little more damage then they're doing now, not signifigantly more- they're almost where they need to be.<P>Chanters- in groups, we're perfect.  On raids, you need 1 chanter, and every chanter beyond that is about as necessary as milk and cookies.  They're nice to have but it will never, ever, ever make the difference between success of failure.  You need a chanter to Tash, and a chanter to through clarity/haste at everyone.  That's it.  Let us nuke, give us charmable mobs, whatever.<P>Hybrid's ought to have an innate reduction in their casting time and an innate increase of the delay between casts. (not recast time- the delay after you cast a spell till the time you can cast any other spell)  Time spent casting spells instead of Melee'ing is time wasted.  Also, SK's/Pallies should be able to taunt more effectively.  Their reduction in damage is now exactly where it ought to be IMHO, but in a group where aggro is important (IE well equiped rogue/monk or a nuker who wants to be useful to the group) SKs or pallies just aren't a viable option.<P>3) All melee classes are balanced perfectly IMO, with the exception of SK's and Pally's lackluster taunting abilities.  Wizzies are almost there, just need to do more damage.<P>4) Clerics need more diversity...  Look through AD&D 2nd edition and look at all the priest spells to see all the various stuff they could do... seeing clerics with Sanctuary and Silence would be great.  It would be nice to give clerics some sort of Harvest ala wizards too... though give it a longer stun to make sure it's only used when the cleric's oom and people are waiting for him/her to get mana back.  A *lot* of time is wasted at raids simply waiting for the cleric to get back to full mana.<P>Hmmm... other stuff....<P>There's a lot of whining in this thread of noticed- clerics can't solo, clerics have dumb right click items, druid's can heal better than I can, blah blah...<P>Don't whine. =P  Giving clerics the ability to solo would completely undermine the class balance.  All classes have crappy right click items... get over it.  My pants are right click Clarity, level 29.  My wrists are right click Reclaim Energy, a spell I never even purchased the scroll for. (I'm didn't even buy most of my pet spells)  My robe is Rune IV, that still uses a dot- a spell that is almost never used, NEVER after we get Rune V.  The most useful right click items in the game, IMO, are right click shrink on cobby bracer (how much do those cost?) summon throwing weapons for whoever it is that throws weapons, and right click group heal, on you guessed it, cleric pants.  And druids can't heal better than you.  Shaddap.  Ever see a druid heal back 6k hp's one Superior Heal at a time?<P>>>As for XP groups, we CAN operate quite well, but we are far from the efficient choice for most level 60 XP grinders. Why would a warrior want to partner with me, when he could have a shaman to buff, slow, debuff and DOT?<P>Hehe Bo.. you know what a shammy does when he's the only healer in a group?  He heals, and slows- only because that means he doesn't have to heal as much.  Buffing takes too much mana, and being out of mana means you sit and your ass, not pulling, waiting for your shammy healer to get mana back.<P>That hardcore xp grinder is going to want you in the group to CH him when he gets down to 30% health- he's going to want the shammy in the group to slow and buff.  He's gonna want a chanter to speed him and clarity you and and the shammy to make everything go quicker, and to mez his multi-pulls so he doesn't wait between pulls.  He's gonna want a rogue for lots of damage, and a warrior tank to take all the damage for him.  Holy crap- he wants a well-balanced group.<P>The only way I can say it is this- the only groups I've ever been in that were good XP were groups that either had clerics in them or did not have anyone tanking.  Clerics are *vital* to a well functioning group.<P>Try this some time- Next time you get an XP group, only use Divine light or Remedy.  That's better than the heals Druid's or shammy's get. (Torpor doesn't count- nothing makes a melee /disband you like casting torpor on them mid-fight)  See how long your mana lasts.  Then, remember that Divine Light and Remedy are more mana-efficient than chloroblast and Tunare's touch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Stylina,<P>Yes, a druid or shaman can heal just as effectively in the end-game AA-XP arena as clerics, while bringing more functionality to that group.<P>While partnering with a RANGER in Chardok I never drop below a few pixels from full mana.  Every other mob or so I might cast a heal.  We carve through blue mobs in roughly 18-seconds.  With Retribution (My best nuke) having a 6-second cast time, 2.5-second recovery, and 6-second recast, that's enough time for me to contribute 512 hit points of damage (If it's not resisted) to the fight.  My total party contribution to each fight is about 1,000 hit points of damage and healing.  Any druid or shaman could do better than that.<P>The same holds true in Velks, Fungus Grove, or any of the basic XP zones for AA-hunters.  While no cleric is asking to be upgraded to the point where we're unbalanced, our primary role has been reduced to the point where we have practically no effectiveness outside of raids and ressurections.<P>You hit it on the head with your equipment analogy.   I could get along just fine in Etherial Mist armor.  If a level 60 warrior walked into a zone wearing Hate armor, few people are going to want him. <P>No one has said that other casters aren't in the same boat, Stylina, but this is a cleric discussion forum, so we're discussing the issue from a cleric perspective.  All casters have been marginalized, but at least you guys DO have some soloing options.  Outside of 'manastone' tricks or extremely inefficient 'root and nuke' on the few undead mobs in the end-game, a cleric has none.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Maybe you people complaining that clerics have nothing to do should stop sitting around in zones designed with easy NPCs for people that suck.<P>No, your group probably doesn't need you when they're farming easy experience in Maiden's, or the VL spiders, or the Chardok entrance. That's why you -go somewhere else-.<P>I'd really like to see that shaman and tricked out warrior break into Drusella Sathir's area in Howling Stones, or take Korocust's room or the kennels in Chardok, or handle Juggernauts in Sebilis, or deal with the level 60 rats in Dragon Necropolis, or handle the nice juicy golems in Velketor's castle. You may not be the ideal experience tool in wussy groups fighting wussy mobs like the barely blue frogs in upper Sebilis, but you still maintain a near monopoly on doing the hard stuff, which is something no other classes outside the triumvirate can say.<P>Yes, AA points and ToV-level loot made the game too damn easy, but you can still find a few interesting places left to go and GO THERE to get your fill of "OMG WE NEED A CLERIC!!11!!!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>...easy NPC's for people who suck...<P>Now that's not an egotistical comment at all, is it?  In fact, I've been to all of those places at one time or another, but none of those places are quick places to pick up a group.  Those zones require a signifigant investment of time just to get into, and the XP in those areas frankly isn't really comparable to the 'easy xp' areas.  It's often difficult to drag guildies away from their 'relaxation' areas between raids, and why bother, when there's perfectly accessible XP to be had in more accessible zones?<P><BR>So your answer to our imbalance is to suggest that clerics move to more dangerous areas, areas of higher risk versus reward?  That's not balance if none of the other classes are doing it.  Balance means that we, as a class, should scale comparably to the other classes in effectiveness throughout the lifetime of our character.<P>I'm afraid that the use of denigrating comments about where someone hunts isn't the sort of logic that I'm going to respect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Borick, I don't think you've been in a group without a cleric in it recently. =)  Like I said- Only use Divine Light and don't heal with your pants.  Casting 1 CH every 5 minutes and chain clicking your pants won't make a dent in your mana.  Casting DL 6 times every 5 minutes is a very different story- which is what druids/shammy's have to do.  A level 60 druid can heal 1k hp's with 400 mana.  A level 39 cleric can heal 6k hp's with 400 mana.  And while your tank can live without potg instead of aego, your friendly neighborhood chanter can't.<P>I *also* think it's time we get a good group together and go deep in chardok.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>As a chanter- I need a cleric in a group to stay alive, unless it's some dumbass spider group in Velks that pulls every 5 minutes.  1900 hp's Druid buffed goes awfully quickly against mobs worth killing.<P>>>but at least you guys DO have some soloing options.<P>Most of my soloing options are poor ones.  The best one I can come up with is to slow a mob, and let it beat on my while I nuke it down, and then bind wound myself back up to 80% health.  This takes about 60% of my health and 80 percent of my mana on light blues in Trak's teeth.<P>I could have my pet tank- but chanter pets have less than 1500 hp's I'm guessing.  Even with every debuff I have available to me my pet lasts less then 15 seconds against a light blue- even if my pet *did* survive the fight, I would get half as much xp for it being a light blue, and then half as much again because my pet out-damaged me.<P>I could charm, but charm breaks too easily.<P>However, I will get dire charm eventually, which will completely change my classes role.  It will be interesting to see what VI does with this.<P>I also see Papasula soloing in Velks a lot, and she kills about half as often as the various groups in there.  Don't tell me you're inferior to a tindi cleric.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Also, I think this is against the point- I don't think clerics, chanters, or anyone else should be given the ability to solo, and I'm rather confused as to how VI sees fit to give so many classes a viable option to grouping.  It is was very against the Vision(tm) a few years back, though I guess opinions have changed.<P>>>6-second cast time, 2.5-second recovery, and 6-second recast,<P>Recast time is the time between a spell finishing and the time you cast your next spell.  That's 12 seconds between nukes, not 14.5... Time it yourself some time =)<P>Also- what's wrong with Reckoning, cleric's level 54 nuke?  Does it no longer exist?  Or is there something wrong with it?<P>If you want to see something silly- compare Chanter nukes to cleric nukes sometime. (the level 44 and 54 ones anyway)  They're basically the same spells with different names.  The biggest difference between them is chanter nukes pull the mob closer and cleric nukes push them away.<P>It will be fairly interesting to see how this plays out- IMO VI has done a fairly good job balancing all the melee problems, I think I'll enjoy seeing how well they tackle the caster issues.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>  There is a flaw in this thread because there are people that are not at the top level of game posting on it.  Clerics are balanced fairly well until you get into the high end game of EQ and look at them from an AAxp perspective.  It is in this one category where clerics fall desperately short, yet many clerics do not see this because they do not get the chance to group with the melees that can fight non stop for 8mins and only be down 2 bubs of hps.  We have nothing to offer groups like this in comparison to the other priests or even a paladin.  Druids and shamans might have less efficient heals, but with their regen spells on a uber equipped melee, there isnt even a need for healing.  Thus, I think it would be best to make a new thread of discussion for those clerics in the higher end of the game to discuss how they think clerics should be balanced because they are the ones that really see how useless we are outside of a raid context.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The last time I used my pants to heal was sometime about five or six months ago, when I got them.<P>Casting Divine Light between mobs is how I heal, typically.  I don't LIKE Complete Heal.  I never have, and I prefer not to use Complete Heal unless the specific instance warrants it.  If I can med up to full between pulls using DL, then I'll do that rather than bother with casting Complete Heal.  I like to think that it's one of the things that's kept my skills sharp.  I never became dependant upon the 'CH crutch' and didn't pick up a lot of the lazy habits that came along with it.  <P>You have a point about the 2.5 second recast time not applying to my nuke, but we're still talking about more than a 12-second period between nukes, and during most fights one still isn't going to get more than one Retribution in on a mob.<P>Nothing you're saying has addressed the principle issue - that some classes scaled while other classes didn't.  Our role has been marginalized outside of the raid environment and yes, enchanters are in the same situation (Or worse) than clerics. Comparing a bad situation to another bad situation isn't what I'm addressing.  <P>There, are things we can do.  Yes, we are still ultimately vital to raids, and that's what defines us.  What's being assessed here is that our role doesn't scale, and that outside of that role we've been hamstrung, possibly because the dev team is only considering our role on raids.<P>Nobody who's posted here has asked that clerics be made into an efficient soloing class.  We're being asked to be given the same consideration that other classes have been given, and some of the things that some of us would like to see considered are our combat effectiveness and defense skills.<P>I've crawled through Chardok as a three-man team (Cleric, Warrior, Enchanter) as far down as the graveyard and bank areas.  This isn't something that a druid could do as effectively, but then it didn't garner me any better XP than sitting in the Observer area did.  Why should we be REQUIRED to take risk to make ourselves useful, if nobody else does? </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I'd really like to see that shaman and tricked out warrior break into Drusella Sathir's area in Howling Stones, or take Korocust's room or the kennels in Chardok, or handle Juggernauts in Sebilis, or deal with the level 60 rats in Dragon Necropolis, or handle the nice juicy golems in Velketor's castle.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>As a level 60 shaman, I just have one question; why would I need a warrior for most of that stuff?<P>Either way, Borick's point stands. An AA group wants to be killing level 45 mobs, cos one dark blue and another dark blue give the same amount of XP, unless the zone itself gives a bonus. If a group has to fight harder mobs, then the group is killing its own efficiency by slowing down the speed at which its killing mobs and getting XP. <P>The above is actually a problem for more than just clerics, though. Your average person really does want the 'balanced' group of a tank, a cleric, a chanter, a nuker, maybe a shaman and a rogue or monk. This ideal group may dilute XP, but it is convenient and safe for everyone involved. Unfortunately, in the so-called end game, most people are only going to want to group with friends of theirs or other people that they know and trust not only in their skills, but in their equipment. This means that, basically, the idea of the pickup group is dying a slow and painful death.<P>As the AA point takes the place of uber loot as the most logical way to advance your character (since anyone can get AA points, but not everyone can get uber loot) this cycle will continue, as a warrior with his epics and primal won't want to group with a level 53 cleric wearing a bloodstained tunic, or a monk in NToV gear won't want to group with a shaman that can't Focus and Primal Avatar him, a chanter that can't VoG him or a ranger that... is a ranger.<P>The suggestion of 'fight in harder spots' is downright silly as a solution to any of the named problems, though. The 'clique' groups want to kill fast, and Deep Pit, Juggs and Korucust area not only mean slower kills for the same amount of XP per kill as Frenzy, Disco or Fort, but they also tend to be less safe, which can introduce the possibility of actual XP loss.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Im experiencing the same problem with getting normal exp groups as others have described and, yeah, soloing is out of the question. Sure - Were needed at raids but I want to have fun (get exp) on normal days too. As a result of this I find myself logging on less and less.<P>Before I continue Id like to ask You why You want better abilities/spells against undeads? There arent any undeads in the expansions? Wheres the undead on Velious? There are some in the Grey and some in ME on Luclin but should those few MOBs really suffice to fulfil the solo exp needs for an entire class?<P>Verant needs to help us out here. We need to be able to solo and we should offer more to an exp group than we do now.<P>Give us better damage output: Better DD spells (ratio) and improved melee abilities. Then theres the issue with our pet. Does *anyone* in his right mind use it? Ive done some testing to see how much damage it does. The word feeble doesnt give justice to it. It lands a hit once in a blue moon and the most Ive seen hit hit for is 45. Get rid of it all together or make it useful to us (ala an enchanters pet).<P>Up our defensive skills: We can wear plate but it doesnt mean jack without any skill, really. MOBs still goes through our armour like it was paper.<P>Increase our spell pool: Were the class with the fewest spells. We actually use even fewer of the ones that are there too. Heals, buffs and an occasional DD or stun to stop a runner/gater. Thats it. Some form of lesser slow or debuff spell would surely help too  both in a group situation and solo. Not even touching utility spells  we have nothing really useful at the moment.<P>Toys: Why so few drops that has any actual use? Wheres the effects that will help us out? Our Velious quest armor produces food for Christ sake. I have a bakery in my bracers  Yay! <P>Maybe I shouldnt post this at all since Im not having a very good day ATM (and I dont think that Verant will brighten any of my coming days either) but Im too miffed to drop this. (Reiterating what others have already said and being incoherent at that, that's me.)<P>Weve spoken about what the cleric class lacks so many times now and Verant has never listened to a word weve said. I dont think they will this time either, brothers and sisters.<P>No Sir, I dont.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Raid-wise we are great.  I would love to see a "Sense of Vitae" type skill though, which would display HP bars of PC's around you within a certain radius (sort of like a short-range tracking, and you could filter out whichever classes you didn't wish to display).  Since we're staring at walls anyway, I don't think any of us would mind this new display taking up much of our screen.<P>Group-wise up to 60 we are great.<P>Group-wise past 60, with aaxp and well-outfitted partners, we are pretty unnecessary.<P>Solo-wise we have no viability at all at any point in the game.<P>Another aspect of the game which I enjoy is dueling...and clerics are completely worthless duelers.<P>So, our only real problem seems to come from the furthest ends of the game, which coincidentally is when even the most dedicated clerics start to lose interest.<P>Well, I agree at the 60+aaxp point we NEED solo viability.  Our peer group simply doesn't need us anymore but for the occasional rez.  At the same time, I LIKE grouping, and I would like to group with my peers and have something valuable to offer, something that makes them feel like splitting that chunk of exp with me is worthwhile.<P>To give us some flexibility in general, I would propose giving clerics a few Curse-based spells with interesting effects.  Reasoning behind giving Curses is to expand beyond the scope of the MR-only spell line-up.  One such spell that I'd particularly like to see is a blind curse.<P>To add a small kick to our solo ability, make the vs. undead nukes/DoTs much more mana efficient.  Add a fixed duration undead root (or an undead snare, but I'm more partial to root).  Add a self-only vs. undead damage shield.<P>The Mark line was a good idea.  Would like to see MoR made unresistible though, like any other damage shield.  Would like to see more Marks with various effects as well.  How bout a mark that drained a bit of mana, ATK, etc. per hit?<P>Our "pet" is worthless, let it go  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>How about a spell (or aa skill/discipline) that sacrificed all our HP to cast an AE CH?

</FONT><HR>Just a tidbit ... I will be adding to this post as I go back and read the other posts :b<P>Druids are great to have around. And no I'm not just saying that because my first character was one. They fill a roll in a group that you may be lacking. That is what they do. They are the "Jacks (and Jills) of all trades, but masters of none". You've heard this before. What does it mean? It means that they can't heal as well as clerics, it means they can't nuke as well as wizards, it means they can't damage shield as well as a mage (well, with one of the ancient spells that has been implemented this is no longer true). <P>Everquest is a game of compromises. I have said this numerous times on different boards and fervently believe in it. A mage compromises defensive skills so that they can do offensive better (in theory). A cleric gives up the power to deal damage so that they can heal better. The warrior gives up being able to have the highest dps so that he can absorb damage better. The druid gives up the ability to specialize in a role so that he may fill a gap that is prevalent (in a group) better. Do you see where I'm going with this?<P>I will agree that the melees in this game are enjoying the game a lot more than the casters. They [casters] are definitely due their bone as far as balancing goes. Just don't lose sight of what it is that we give up so that we may do OUR job better. We are not paladins. Would I like to be able to charge at my foe and strike fear into the hearts of my enemy with the wrath of my chosen God? Yes! But I can realistically see a paladin doing that not the priest (although we are a plate wearing class). <P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>First, we want clerics to gain more diversity and ability to solo. The most suggested ways to do this so far have been ... 2) a MUCH more practical and useful pet (so we can heal it, and have it deal damage for us) 3) better spells to be used for solo'ing. While this is in the area of damage spells, other spells that fill a 'niche' might be useful here as well such as better fears, roots, dots, etc.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Okay I have a problem with this. On the second point, that would be a mage, or a pet class. We are not a pet class. We have a toy that is fun to play around with atm but not overtly useful. Third point illustrates what a necro does. We are not necros. We all have our niche, we all have our roles. Why are we trying to dilute the classes even more than they already are? I for one don't want to see that happen. <P>D'oh! There were questions asked on the first post... okay, here are my thoughts :P<P><I>1) What do you think most needs to be changed for clerics and their class? </I><P>* make the mana ratio of our nukes stream lined (not cost more in terms of ratio for higher level dd)<P><I>2) Which classes do you feel need an upgrade?</I><P>* Magicians foremost, they have a lot of issues that need to be addressed. I would say all casters (wis and int casters) need upgrades as well (but we already agree on that  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> )<BR>* Bards also need to be looked at <P><I>3) Which classes do you feel are 'just right' ?</I><P>*cough* melee *cough* Specifically rogue, monk, warrior (since those are the baseline etc) <P><I>4) if you could personally choose one thing for clerics to gain/lose etc... what would it be? Top of the list choice here </I><P>Have religion come into play more into the game. This has been brought up before but I want to have a reason for picking the God that I did when I started this character. Faction is just something to keep you from certain places etc but really... I want to gain the blessings of my chosen God to do his Will (whether it be Inny - twisting mobs into painful torture, or Brell - to spread laughter and merriment with every cup o' ale). Maybe I'm just longing for the old D&D type of roleplay /shrug<P><BR>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15286" TARGET=_blank>Spawrhawk Wormwood</A><BR>High Priest of Fennin Ro<P>[This message has been edited by Spawrhawk (edited 03-10-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by Spawrhawk (edited 03-10-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>What I would like to see for clerics:<P>~AA skill to lower healing agro. (Make it 1-3 skill with like 5% - 15% reduction.)  Not to much to make it unbalancing.<P>~MGB 2 and 3 that lowers the recast time. (72 to 62 to 52) Again, not to much to unbalance but enough to be worth it.<P>~A 2k hp heal after level 55 for 350mana and 5second cast time.  I love CE but sometimes you need a quick hard heal.<P>~Cheaper peridots.  Im so blasted tired of being poor.<P>~Remove the dumb spells from our Velious armor.  Summon abundant food/water just blows.  How can they justify removing these effects from Bard Kunark armor only to give it to clerics on Velious armor?! /boggle <BR>Give us ShoW or Stun or Earthquake.  I like the MoK on the BP simply because its free and usefull to eat the DS on mobs, and because I cant aford to buy the blasted spell.  The pants are fine for downtime / bored healing.<P>For other priests:<P>~Give shaman and druids self only buffs like our Armor line.  Only fair imho and as long as we all overwrite eachother (with slightly better group spells) it only helps when relying only on self buffs.<P>~Fix the frelling spell drops.  Please, fix it right this time.  I dont want to see 5,267 copies of MalA drop while NO cleric spells drop and NO shaman spells drop.  Oh and kill the drop of vendor sold spells too.  Thats just dumb.<P>Int Casters:<BR>~Um, dunno, I dont play int casters.  But I know some great ones! If anything helps my mage, necro, chanter and wizard friends and guildmates, good!<P>------------------<BR><B><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47541" TARGET=_blank>~Calimayrn Anam'Cara</A> </B><BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Farstorm ~ Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Last night was the most frustrating night for me EVER!!! and it was all due to high level soloing AA point sucking freaks!! SolB has been home to the most idiotic trains i've ever seen, one train wiping out 11 people and the monk who cause it FD and lived. To top this all off I was 4 blue from 49 and there were no groups for me, the soloers didn't want me except the occasional run to the zone line where i was and a "heal plz" Then I couldn't find a port which just added to the frustration. <P>So here is my 2cps worth of ranting. We NEED to be able to solo. I do not like the fact that I am paying the same amount of money as everyone else and I can't get a group because my role can be filled and I can't solo because it doesn't "fit the vision tm." I shouldn't have to make another class to get this same option it seems everyone else in the game except my class is able to enjoy so there must be a way to give us the option to solo, without taking anything away from other classes. I keep getting stuck on this "we're the masters of the undead" thing, which really we're not bu we are ok at it. So what about some more undead spells. Undead only snare, better undead only DoTs, giving our summoned hammer MASSIVE and i mean huge bane damage maybe with a proc to them, an undead charm spell, adding a spell like the rangers have that adds a proc to a person's weapons but make ours undead only procs. I like what someone said about how you can have 2 druids in a group or 2 shaman and then both have a part to play, but if you get 2 clerics whats the point? I just fail to see how a monk, with far less ac than i have, and without the benifit of spells can solo and i cannot!!! Increase 1 aspect of our class, like the undead aspect, and you can then have another option for clerics. Not only would we have more to add in exp groups and raids, but with something like that we could then solo. When it comes to undead no one should be able to out damage us in a one on one basis. Sorry if this puts a bad taste in people's mouths but it's true. Should we be able to out nuke a wizard against undead? never!! but if we were to stick all our DoTs, whack on it with our summoned hammers, have our procs we casted on the hammers go off and cast a few of our DDs yes we should be able to out damage them in the long run. <P>and in order to give up some of our "monopoly" on the cleric end I think they should give some of our spells to other classes. Shaman should be able to rez, not druids though it doesn't fit the class. Give shaman our 50% exp rez. Give druids a better heal if they want, I think it would be nice to finally get this monkey off our backs and be able to do other things for once. <p>[This message has been edited by Aean (edited 03-11-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I know a way VI could fix the entire cleric's-can't-solo issue in one fell swoop, and they wouldn't even have to add any new spells (though an undead snare or slow would be N-I-C-E). There is even a basis for it looking at AD&D, which is what EQ is supposed to be based on, originally. Druids and shaman would be unable to complain, and fun would be restored to the life of high level clerics everywhere. What is this ultimate panacea? Quite simple, really:<P>Tag all heals except CHeal (and WoR, obviously) as damaging to undead.<P>And there would be singing in the streets, birds would chirp and rainbows would fill the sky. That one simple little thing would once again open up the end game for clerics. We would no longer be considered by raid leaders only as "do I use him in a Cheal chain or to throw spam heals??" Soloing would be as viable for us as any other caster class, especially the priest classes. There is a solid reasoning for it-the divine power that can heal the living can equally destroy the undead. We would have usable AoEs (AoE heal = AoE undead nuke now).<P>Oh yeah, and one more thing-fix the freeking symbol quests that aren't working/put in ones for the religions that don't have them. So far, this and diety-specific jewelry/idols are the only thing differentiating the choice of gods for us. Throw everyone this little bone, at least.<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 54th Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Tailor (163)Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??) <BR>Proud wearer of the 7th prayer shawl.<BR>Coldfyre <BR>Warrior of the 14th Blade<BR>Grandmaster Mule (255) Grandmaster Trader (255) <P>Drinal Server <BR>"These balls are making me testy!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Actually Mikar...it wouldn't make our current DoT line useless (though I agree on the DD)-ask any necro/druid/shaman about stacking =).<P>I contend that clerics/druids/shaman (being priests) *should* be the most powerful class when it comes to killing undead, with clerics being slightly ahead of the rest of the pack. The turn undead AA ability was a step in the right direction for us, but I think it needs to be expanded upon.<P>/roleplay on<BR>We weild the power of our gods-a cleric should be a truly awesome force when faced with a horde of undead. Any person devoted and pious enough to have reached the upper levels of the priesthood should be a shining beacon of light (or menacing beacon of the dark forces for out evil brethren) in the dark, evil places where the undead hold sway. Undead beings should cringe at the sight of us and whither at our holy touch, ripped apart by the very power that serves to mend the wounds and stem the bleeding of our living companions.<BR>/roleplay off<P>I would also contend that Torpor would be a better spell than CE. Think about it-Torpor is 300 less damage for 100 less mana, but also adds in snare/slow/mana reduction. Nature's Recovery/Touch for druids would also be amazing spells-1Kish DD and 900 DoT. Though I agree that all these spells would be truly awesome against undead-I also feel that they should-level 59+ clerics/shamans/druids should be able to rip through undead foes as easily as necromancers destroy living foes.<P>When you consider the fact that these spells only work on a limited set of creatures (undead) and that our spells vs live mobs would still be much less than optimal, you're not really unbalancing us when compared to other classes, just opening up moer options for us. Wizards would still be the kings of DD vs live mobs (and vs undead in many cases), shaman/necros/mages would still have the edge on us in damage due to having useable pets. Druids/wizards would still be the masters of quad-kiting and transportation. <P>In other words, you would be expanding the role of all the priest classes (since druids and shaman also get heals) and opening up some more options for both soloing and grouping for clerics.<P>All without needing to add new spells, abilities, etc-you would just need to add an extra bit to the spells that currently exist.<P>Not to attack you Mikar, but rather to respond to what you said, coming here and posting "that would be nice, but will never happen" only hurts our case for things being changed and acts only as criticism. If I were VI and read that, I'd think "they can't even decide amongst themselves what they want, so why bother paying attention to what they're saying?". Better to either post your own ideas, ignore the ideas you don't agree with or at least be constructive in your criticisms. Constructive criticism opens the door for healthy discussion and debate, whereas pure criticism only closes doors for everyone involved.<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender<BR>Vicar of the 54th Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Weilder of the Water Sprinkler of Nem`Ankh<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Tailor (163)Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??) <BR>Proud wearer of the 7th prayer shawl.<BR>Coldfyre <BR>Warrior of the 14th Blade<BR>Grandmaster Mule (255) Grandmaster Trader (255) <P>Drinal Server <BR>"These balls are making me testy!"</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Just want to jump on the 'more solo ability' bandwagon.<P>I'm an active cleric in a fulltime raid guild. I'm also the only non60 player in my guild. Why? Because we raid basically every night and putting together a group, getting to xp spot, then killing enough to get some decent xp takes a long time.<P>If I could solo for an hour here and there, before or after raids, it would make a huge difference. But, cleric solo ability ranges from inefficient (against undead) to laughable (against anything else).<P>As said many times before, making our hammer pet static, giving us an undead snare, or upgrading our undead dots are all realistic options, IMO.<P>Just looking for a fun and useful role outside of raids =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008066-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008066.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008066-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008066&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008066&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
