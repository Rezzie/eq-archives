<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Midan</div><div class="date">01-18-2000, 01:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me just say that I have been playing since a few weeks after release, yet I am only L30. It's mostly due to the fact that I cant seem to get a stable group and stick with them. The last 5 levals I spent in Cazic, and it was fun, but now I find the exp in cazic drying up. Tae - Chance at good loot, but exp sucks. Gators - Was good exp 25-30 but find that with each leval exp got worse. Bowl - Most green to low blue, no exp there. Lower Zig - train prone, not very good exp though. Upper Zig - Was grouped with people 34-38 and got very little exp. <br />
So I am done with Cazic, where to? I have heard basement of Unrest is good... can a 30 cleric get in a group there? Mistmoore maybe,..very train prone though. Anyway, just want some powerlevaling advice, I am SICK of being L30 and want to get to L50 so I can start going on nagafen/vox/pof/poh raids.</div></div><hr />

I feel your pain.<br />
<br />
I hunted the treants in South Karana thru lvl 31. However, I am sure they are very camped now.<br />
<br />
Because there are more people in Lower Guk now, you should be able to find a group and hunt near the zone.<br />
<br />
I hunted in Lower Guk til lvl 39. Then I moved to Sol B.<br />

I have been in lvl 30 for a month because of the toughness of lvl 30. In 30, you have to kill a hundred things to get a tinch of exp. One death and you loose half a bubble. I went to the keep just 3 bubbles into 30, got lucky on 2 occasions and got in the Raider room when I logged on. In 2 evenings I am now a half a bubble from 31. The last couple of nights there has been a list with 6 or 7 ahead of me so I camped and played my other character, but if you're fortunate enough to get in a group early on then the Keep is an excellent place to level on up.<br />

<br />
1) Halflings and (more to the point),<br />
<br />
2) Cazic Thule<br />
<br />
Don't take this as a flame but  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule at 30 should still be excellent xp.  In fact even just pulling from the maze will be very good xp. Green pool and blue pool gators are fantastic xp. Sewars is wonderful. Throne room lower and Upper are very good, bowl is average. The zig with the 4 corners (towers) is outstanding. The Pyrimid where the silver guards is, is also fairly average.<br />
<br />
At 30th Cazic has so many options available, the majority of players are between 30th and 35th.  Those that hit 35 seem to move on to greener pastures ie Guk.<br />
<br />
I can not disagree with you more, Cazic is a truly wonderful zone for your level, and IMHO is a powerlevelers dream zone.<br />

You will get great XP (depending on your group's levels) and the chance at the Dwarven Work Boots (RARE spawn).  I highly recommend the ghost group. I haev been in there since 28 and will be there throught 30 and maybe 35.<br />
<br />
Fare thee well.<br />
