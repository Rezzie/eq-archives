Yes, there are some badass mobs right down in the guts of the dungeon, but around the zone and the bedroom everything is 30ish level.  <br />
<br />
Shin ghoul knights are soloable with about 3 bubs of mana used at 32, and if you can grab a group and head to the bedroom (BR) the xp will just pour in.<br />
<br />
Just a word of warning - you tend to get hit by every train, and they are ugly.  So if you hear a train call, get the hell out of there.  <br />
<br />
But there is still great xp from about 30-31 onwards.</div></div><hr />

I see 'shin ghoul knight' and first thought that comes into my mind is 'no way I'm taking those HTs as a cleric!' (ghoul knights in sebilis are all SKs), and then I realize you're talking about guk...<br />
<br />
Hmmm, 3 bars of mana at 32? Interesting, I remember them being harder when I first went into lower guk with my rogue at 34... then again, it was a rogue. I was planning to wait until 34 (expel undead, force, valor) before going there, but I guess I'll run over there now  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
