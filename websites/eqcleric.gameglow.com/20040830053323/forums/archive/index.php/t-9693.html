The whole goal for me was to obtain powerful armour that could not be looted. But no, Verant had to change that, so now I have worked my rear off for almost nothing. I am really angry. And many quest items will be camped by other classes and the armour sold to us clerics, only making it harder to actually quest for it.<br />

The only reason I spent HOURS and HOURS getting the gauntlets and boots was for the simple reason that the items were no drop. It didnt matter to me that the spawning times and the expense was ridiculous because you were getting armor that you would always have with you. BAH!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomma</div><div class="date">10-22-1999, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, for one, am fairly happy that they've removed the NO DROP from our armor.<br />
<br />
You see, I'm married, work a full time job, AND have a kids to raise.  I don't have 10 hours to stare at the ground.  <br />
<br />
It really has NOTHING to do w/ patience.  It more toleration of lunacy.  Lets say, you wanted to buy a new car.  Would you be willing to go to the dealer, &amp; just look at the ground for 10 hours, before you actually got to pick one out &amp; test drive it?  Hell NO!   <br />
<br />
That's REAL LIFE, TOO!  If yer not willing to do that in real life, it's bordering the insane, that we're expected to do it in a false world.  <br />
<br />
Making this armor NO DROP, only makes it obtainable by someone who can only play a couple of hours at time, a couple of times a week.<br />
<br />
The ONLY valid complaint against the removal of NO DROP, is the folks who play PvP.  Either on the PvP servers, or who duel quite a bit.   I'd be cranky, too.  But, they've only made ours just like everyone elses.  Its not balanced, if OURS is NO DROP, &amp; ALL OTHERs aren't. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">10-22-1999, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was a better solution than making the armor sellable -- how about just changing the spawn times to 10 minutes or so?  Similar to the Rods and Coins for the Wizards and Enchanters high level spell quests?  To me this would have made MUCH more sense than making the icons and ingots something that -- when they finally spawn -- are now being grabbed by any idiot who thinks he can sell the armor to some poor slob of a cleric!  Forget it!  I for one refuse to buy it... period.<br />
<br />
You want class balance?  The mobs for Ranger and Bard quests spawn fairly frequently -- even post patch.  Definitely not 7 hours between spawns -- even the supposedly rare named griffin still spawns every hour or two.  (Don't get me started on the ranger armor... chain that is tons better than our plate, and incredibly easy to get, too.  Of course, we all know what class the uber-GM plays -- no surprise there I guess.)</div></div><hr />

I assisted a ranger with Grimfeather one night and after we killed him 10 mins later...he showed up again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While the cleric armor is no longer no drop, you can pick up Shin Greaves from Ghouls in lower Guk which *are* no drop.  This is a quest item for bard armor, but heck, it looks like steel plate and has AC10 with +5 vs Disease (I know, it's not like we need it  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif.  It is *lighter* the bronze and provides the same protection.  I know clerics can wear it (as well as Bards and Paladins.. not sure who else, but not many more), as I'm wearing a pair myself.<br />
<br />
While this might not be much, it is slightly helpful... (even if we have to take a bard quest item to get it).<br />

You know how every so often there is a hypothetical &quot;max the wisdom&quot; thread? I wonder what the &quot;max the sv disease&quot; armor would be?  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
For one thing, our spawns are long and boring, and the items aren't the best there is. Why would a druid want to farm that when he can spawn something more wanted, and thus easier to sell?<br />

Grimfeather is a whimp my group that travels around killed him several times when he ran into us while we were meding and then there were those blasted HGs that dared to try and kill others while we were in the zone... talk about a masacre of big things... hint... Druid=ensare Cleric=inspire fear/wrath/beat down Warrior=beat down Ranger = Beat down... one HG died so fast that a passer byer dien't even have time to con it LOL... sigh... wish OUR quest was that much fun :-(<br />
