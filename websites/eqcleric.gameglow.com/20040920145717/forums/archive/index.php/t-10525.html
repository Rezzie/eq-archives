<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely.  I am a big time advocate on highkeep.  I have spent a lot of time there and have gotten a lot of xp and a lot of good loot there.  Once you get to 24 and get greater heal, you can group with people that are a lot higher than and do some of the bigger tougher things and get good xp because you can keep up with them with your healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vinlaen</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll definitely second that.  I got from 23 -&gt; 27 there in a few nights.  However once I hit 27 most of the stuff was getting lower and lower blue (even the guards were white.. some yellow, but some were blue) so I moved to cazaic and am almost 29 from hunting the gators there.  GREAT XP!  Loot is the worst that I've ever seen (gators don't drop any cash or any real items).<br />

The loot there is great and the xp is good also.  The warriors/raiders and seers all con red to me at almost level 30.  There are a couple other gobs that spawn there that are blue, but no greenies to me yet.  I made about 65 pp last night from loots.  I also got a pair of bronze leggings, bronze boots, FS scimitar, FS great staff, FS war hammer and a few pages which I sold for about 5 pp each.</div></div><hr />
