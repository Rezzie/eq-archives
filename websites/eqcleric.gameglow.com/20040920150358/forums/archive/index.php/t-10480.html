<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meddik</div><div class="date">11-08-1999, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, The hand Room is pretty good XP at 21 with a full group(20-22). (Need 2 healers there though!)<br />
<br />
The magi room was pretty good in a full group (22-25 +me at 21)<br />
<br />
If I am looking for a group, is it better to aim high (24 range) or stick to my own level?  In short, is the xp penalty of being lower level made up by fighting higher xp mobs?<br />

Last night (or was it the night before? whatever.) I was with a group in the throne room in Cazic with a group of 30s all the way up to 35. I was still getting a fine amount of experience, even though I was level 25. (And I got my lizardscale mantle, yay!) So as far as I've seen, it seems that it doesn't really matter what their level is, as long as you get the &quot;You gain party experience!&quot; message.<br />

Even though that means I may not get the most experience, I have found that staying alive and fighting a greater quantity of targets is a better method of gaining experience (especially in Unrest).  I don't know if the lower level penalty is balanced by the higher XP mob, but I do know that fighting a large quantity of medium mob's beats a few high quality mob's 99.9% of the time.  My opinion: group with people a few levels above and fight till you drop!<br />

I have had recent experience in higher level groups and I believe it is advantages. I agree with another poster that the exp bubbles move up at the same rate regardless of level. It must be set so that percentage wise, we're still getting the same percentage towards next level as our higher level friends. We get the added bonus of getting exp on some mobs that con green to our high level friends and better loot.<br />
