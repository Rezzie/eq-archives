<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyron</div><div class="date">02-28-2000, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate this. I run to Lower Guk about 2 Am...  only 900 people on the server, and L Guk has 40...  there are 4 people up at the zone, 3 Paladins grouped picking off spawns. So I sit and OOC for a group.  And I repeat every 8-10 minuets.  I heal and buff the peoples up top and keep them alive.  I'm 36.. Waiting for a chance.  Frenzied asks for people but don't want to add them to the random for the item. I think Hmm I can do that. Just want to get some XP and some FS any ways...  So I send the asking person (was a fellow Cleric I've seen a couple times.) and she tells me that she will ask.  So she asks and I get a reply, Sorry but they feel that you are too low. =( UGH. Now I have a Friend that is in Sol B asking for a group for a Himself, Ranger and me. (I was bound out side in LS yet) It was full, no one had room for both but would take the Ranger...  no big deal I tell him to have fun.  Then get a tell from him with a name to ask for a group in Sol B.  So I ask, they check then tell me that I'm too low. Run to Cazic to check there...  Spent 2 hours yelling picking off trains at the zone trying to get a group and was shot down 3 times because I was too high =(  *sigh* ok, so Now I'm too low? I'm 36 and stuck at 36 because I'm not able to get into a group? Man I hate that. Why am I, a 36 Cleric, Always told that I'm Too high or Too low! How far is the spread after 40? I though I could basically get XP from just about any group after about 35.  I don't think I'm that far off.  <br />
<br />
Some times I wish I was a Greedy KSing class so I could see once what they do. =(  Not to mention that I would not be so dependant on a group.<br />

At 39, you grouping situations are much more open to you.  I did my time in CT up until 39 and brought friends I met there into the BR and so on...</div></div><hr />

Just foolishness to try poking around the lower floor. After I got lvl 39 (and CH) this room really started rocking. Made 4 bubs on lvl 40 in maybe 7h, can't claim to be impressed by hell levels.<br />
The rest of guk isn't very good exp though, better move to SolB after 41 to hunt the kobolds.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't exactly say 36 is where too low to be in many of the groups that occupy LGuk. At 34 I spent time in the SR room with some higher lvl's closer to 40 and that was actually pretty scary compared to the Ritualist and surrounding areas, but it was doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyron</div><div class="date">02-28-2000, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL Told that I'm Too Low again. Well I tell you what. I've played on frenzied before at 34.. only there 3 hours but was great fun. made 1.5 bubbles there. That's why I keep trying to get back to deeper parts of L Guk.  Now If only Someone would get a clue =)  As I said I would have been main healer probably and just healing... there was already a Cleric in the group. I learned about noon today that they took a 35 Druid after I left.<br />

Sure, I died a couple of times, but it was fun. I had enough healing power to support the group ok. The only problem is if anything aggros on you, but if you're careful and the rest of the group knows what they're doing you should be ok.<br />
<br />
One thing I like about being a cleric is that you are useful to a party at much lower levels than many other classes.<br />

Hehe .... at 44 hit the lord room if you can, that place ROCKS for exp.  I spent lvls 35-45 in lower guk.  Didn't take very long at all.  My friends kept telling me to slow down  lol.<br />

<br />
Nothing like handleing 5-6 lizard rushes and coming through it.  CT will teach you many things about being a great healer and a groupmate.<br />
<br />
As a side note,  a group of lvl 30 people can hold the BR, and a newbie can walk from dead-zone to the lord. That is just sad.</div></div><hr />

That's not worse then walking into Sol A at level 30 and trying to camp the King room =)  Been in hot water, know what to do.  Been in places where 5-9 mobs are beating on me and I still have to cast.  Also  done 3 seafurys at once with a 33-35 group... Now that's where Bards &amp; Enchanters are Gold! =)I know  allot more then I should, but mostly your Right, not everyone has a Enchanter that is a DE Cleric 10+ levels higher on another server talking me through the hard parts.. *Hugs Emmy &amp; Sandie*<br />
