I grouped with him once or twice when we were in our teens, and he seemed like a good guy. Now, the GUILDS (no names, cough cough) on the other hand, really piss me off. Simply because there are more people in the guild than Bandayd, they throw around their numbers and get him banned. WTF? I also have had problems with the aforementioned guild, and I know EXACTLY how Bandayd feels. It just doesn't seem right to me. A bunch of (insert explicative here) get together, form a guild, and get anyone who speaks out against them banned. I cannot speak for everyone in this guild, but I know for a fact that 5 times I have had serious problems with people/groups from this guild. I just find it ludicrous that Verant would ban someone for speaking out. If Bandayd was training things into them or something, I could see it, but come on, why the hell even put an /ignore filter in the game? GAH. I like Everquest, I really do, but it is things like this that really get me. To hell with all the ^&amp;&amp;98&amp;#$@! guilds out there who shove their numbers around and want to be the 'best'. Just have fun, don't make our lives hell too.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
Now, you should discount a whole guild just because a few bad seeds.   I have heard rotten things said about many guilds in and on the Cazic Thule server, however, in my experience prejudice against an entire guild for the actions simply makes you as bad as the individuals that you complain about...<br />

Everytime I DO see a &amp;lt;Fire Of Heavens&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Dragons of Asia&amp;gt;, etc tag, I get a little nervous about their integrity, but I give them a chance. This has bit me in my bum more times than not, but I still do. sigh. I'm sure they do have some nice members. I'm sure the mafia does too.</div></div><hr />

I'm soooooo glad I moved of Finan Ro in the first week. One nice thing on Cazic-Thule is that the &quot;powerfull&quot; guilds all get along reasonably well. Sure, we have our confrentations from time to time, but none of the petty BS I hear about on other servers, and most of the time it gets worked out in short order.<br />

<br />
We have a guildpage devoted to the guild that talks of much of what we're about. We are on Norrath to destroy the ignorance of others and accept all races and classes within our guild in order to achieve perfect harmony(of sorts, hehe).  People who see me in many zones will often say,&quot;you're in evoluxa?!?!  I love that guild, you guys are great!&quot;  <br />
<br />
This happens more often then you think and we are a very RP oriented guild who love to RP with others as much as possible. We have good times and bad like many guilds, but have never sought to ruin other people's fun and would be apt to reprimand anyone in our guild who would seek to do so. We hold lots of social functions and started the trade festivals on our server.<br />
<br />
I hope this gives you a slightly different view of what some guilds are all about.<br />
