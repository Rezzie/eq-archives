Currently, I'm in LG killing stuff around zone, both live and undead stuffs.<br />
<br />
I'm not too horribly fond of Kunark, so I'm wondering...where's a good place, other than Lower Guk, to solo at for someone my lvl?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
Non-Kunark, things are a lot thinner on the ground.  Low Guk near the dead zone is great, but can get crowded with people, plus spawns are slow.<br />
<br />
You could try for soloing the tree spectre in Ferrott, but I'm finding even at 39 its a bit tricky - at 35 I couldn't do it, kept on going oom.<br />
<br />
I can't think of anywhere else soloable.  Griffons/Giants have too many hit points, Mistmoore is train ridden, and impossible to get in without invis (or wading through oceans of aggro greenies).<br />
Maybe CT, I don't think green lizzies are aggro.  A runner would spell disaster tho...<br />
<br />
Really, if you are mid 30s, you either group up (where at 35 with Sup Heal you will be REAL popular), or get to Kunark...<br />

I did spend alot of time in Lake of Ill Omen, I really did like that zone, but most of them, I don't like.  <br />
<br />
I might try Kaesora, but last time I was there during peak time (with my Iksar Shaman), there wasn't anyone at all. I dunno.  I might go back to doing Forest Giants in FV with a group *shudders when he watches how slowely his exp bar moves*<br />

I did this once as a pseudo-tank (not exactly relevant, but had a blast) and the spawn rate around RV was unbelievable...we'd get one killed off with a full group, dual clerics (40 and 35) and another would be either popping or had wandered by and agro'd. I don't think you can really do the area very well until maybe late 30's on less than 4 people, if you're u-guild potential. Just my humble opinion.<br />
