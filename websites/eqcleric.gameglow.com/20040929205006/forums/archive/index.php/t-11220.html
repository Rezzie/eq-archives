<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambul Ants</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like our class will be changing. <br />
<br />
Assuming the following <br />
5 k mob<br />
<br />
Cleric lvl 56-60<br />
Our melee dmg with the new proc is about 30dmg/sec<br />
Our hammer pet can contribute 10dmg/sec<br />
Some sort of bash skill<br />
<br />
What will be the best regular(not undead) Strategy for non casters, or casters?<br />
<br />
My Starting spell line up would be DA, DB,  Judgement, Mark of Retribution, Immobolize, Unswerving Hammer of Faith, Yaulp 5, Swap heal spell (Celestial Elixir most likely)<br />
<br />
Pull with MoR, send in the pet, Judgement, Yaulp 5 and wade in.<br />
<br />
If you get hit 3 times per tick MOR will add 8 dmg per sec, putting You + pet + MoR at 48 dmg per sec.  If every thing goes well you have a dead mob in 110 sec just-under two min. If Judgement lands full less. <br />
<br />
Assuming you have to root and heal,  or channel a heal, more likely to take 3 min/kill.  <br />
<br />
Mana Spent-125 for MOR, 250 for the pet, 300 for Judgement, 2xCE for 600, 80 for root, some net bennifit for Yaulp 5 lets say add back 100 mana over the three min.<br />
<br />
By my math that is a dead mob in 3 min for 1275 in mana roughly 1/3 of my mana pool.  With out additional mana regen I should be able to kill 9 mobs per hour.  Not to bad if I'm board.<br />
<br />
<br />
What would your do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just where do you find a blue to 60 mob with 5k hp that you can pull single?<br />
<br />
Most have more like 8k hp as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
Without a sizeable DS I dont see porcupining as getting good enough for us. Thats why I think Y5 needs a 33 or 50 pt DS added - and/or MoR needs to have 3x the DS but only 1/2 or 1/3 the duration. With 33 pts from Y5, 45 pts from MoR and say 8 pts from a Coldain ring we could reach acceptable levels - far from good - but acceptable.<br />
<br />
I also think your estimate of 3 times per tick is too high when it comes to getting hit. Mobs hit for atleast 50 on average (and thats low too - most are closer to 100) - so that would be 2500 dmg/min atleast - and hence not healable by the 1 CE per min you calculate with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quilawan EM</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a slightly different plan. My main exp targets will be Bats/Skellies in ME. I will pull with snare from the tunare neck, stick on mor and mok, stick on the highest undead dot, fear, and melee. I will redot and refear as needed. Im not exactly sure how well this will work but I think it will provide the best results.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">08-23-2002, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll pull with judgement, root/nuke until its dead, spiritstone to Kaladim, get to Fm with manastone and gate back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh wait....I do that already.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nightgod<br />
<br />
With horse (before it was nerfed), Faithstone, Manastone, C3, focus items, FT8 and SCM3 I did just that in ME.<br />
<br />
Result - slightly less than 3 blue/hour. So - for nuking+Manastone to work - the ZEM needs to higher or the mobs needs to have fewer hp. Without C3, focus and horse its just useless (imho).<br />
<br />
I did the same in Neriak killing Ogres (cept I didnt need to faithstone) for about the same exp. Definitely no more than 3.5 blue/hour - though this was without C3 though.<br />
<br />
Anyway - I still hope to find those 5k hp mobs that can be single pulled and only do 20 dps to me - then I think I could exp decently solo. Main problem though is that such mobs would be dead to monks etc before I got there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can kill a blue in around 4.5 mins in ac with primal/dawnfire 34% haste combo - and typically I don't really use any mana that is not regened by c3.  Given that the mobs cast shroud of hate - my pet doesn't despawn so thats even less mana used - though with the change to the spell its not as big a deal any more.  Still those have 7.5k hps ish.  Admittly it does depend on the proc rate of my dawnfire, but they typically are down to about 15-25% by the time my first mor has worn off - and I have a hard time justifying the cost of the second one.<br />
<br />
Would be quicker with hammer of the sun or the new summoned hammer.  Can't wait to test it out.  Though it does mean being a battle cleric no longer be unique.<br />
<br />
Pity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karag</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to learn where is good mobs to solo with melee and pet. I don't have much time to explore and tests so I usually end going to fungusgrove where I have seen so many other classes solo... I pull with nuke, hit with mor while its still running. Then cast out pet and start to melee with primal brawlstick till it procs, then switch to shield (41 haste) and righteousness. Reaply mor when needed and toss a heal or two and maybe another nuke. If I have kei on I can kill 1 shroom per 6 minutes down time included, tad bit longer if no kei. Shrooms have abouts 9Khps, is there many mobs that con blue at lvl 60 that have somewhat less? like in 5 to 7K range and where can I find those? Or lightblue mobs with even less hp? I have dawnfire for undead mobs too but haven't been overly impressed by its proc rate. Haven't tested much soloing with it yet thou, just in groups where you can be happy if ya get avarage 1 proc per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have done HS entrance and basement, gave damn good XP.<br />
i used Paralysing earth(3 min root)<br />
all 3 dots(Elixir of life, turning of the un., sermon of the righteous)<br />
and had judgement for golems and slime.<br />
<br />
<br />
with just using the dots on the skellies and the ghosts, i never went below 80% mana..the nonundead mobs however used up more mana.<br />
<br />
the mobs have relatively low hp compared to other zones i have tested(Grey, chardok, ME) so it works out nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deawellyn</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Corynthia:<br />
<br />
wanted to try HS out solo couple of times but raiding always takes me away from it; can you tell me please what was the exp in AA in blues / hour in HS entrance/basement, assuming 50% are LB, 50% are blue &amp; did you have KEI or not, what's your FT# status, thanks<br />
<br />
Because it's simple - if it's 4+ blue / hour it is worth it, if not, it isn't :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was there for around 3 hours(wasnt tracking time), got around 6 blue bubs, had KEI the first hour.<br />
<br />
I have FT8 in gear and AAXP, and ye can check other info in my profile.<br />
<br />
im not saying it was easy, but it was challenging, and that was exactly what i was looking for.<br />
<br />
I managed to avoid several roamers that werent undead, so with killing undead i could kill them nonstop.<br />
I was very lucky with spawns, got very few lightblue,.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'd need to see at least a 3-5 X improvement or the new solo stuff won't make me happy. druids/wizards quad to almost a bub an hour.</div></div><hr />

Please advise,<br />

<br />
2800 isn't too high. even with 3250HP buffed at lvl 60 and AC just a tad over 1000 I see my HP drop a lot and pretty fast against shrooms in FG (and god knows how much time these spend casting).<br />
<br />
Don't bother getting AC much over 1k. Work on HP if you wish to melee, mana if you with to root-nuke/rot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haffil</div><div class="date">09-07-2002, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Velks spiders are ridiculously easy with the hammer and pet.<br />
<br />
Pull with MoR, hit Yaulp V when mob is close, turn on attack(:P)cast pet after first round of hits, you can usually channel thru spider hits with ease.<br />
<br />
Once pet is in action, strafe around to where you can see your pet, just incase you're not used to using pet hp bars etc. Heal with Ethereal remedy once/twice and by that time, spider is dead and you've used(after regening w/Y5) around 10-15% mana.<br />
<br />
My hps/ac fully self buffed is real close to 4k and 1155AC. Just keep Y5 on the whole fight and you'll actually regen quite a bit. Each fight takes approx 2.5-3.0min depending on level/type of spider.</div></div><hr />
