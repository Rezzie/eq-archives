<br />
Besides this, a team of 5-6 MB wizards can be &quot;hired&quot; for fights like VS, Gore or similar...<br />
<br />
Don't you think, if this goes on like this, it will spoil the game?<br />
<br />
Will future raids consist of 1 cleric, 1 enchanter and 4-x wizards? (possibly a monk too) Will there be raid force only be needed to escort the wizards to the &quot;uber mob&quot; in dungeons? I know that wizards whined long enough about never finding exp groups - but in my opionion manaburn makes them way too powerful. <br />
Well if it had a recovery time like our res. But its 2.24h (mb) vs 72h (res). <br />
Or if it had a level restriction like DC.<br />
Or if it would at least need more than the crappy 5 AA points.<br />
Well I just spent my 9 points for MGB /sigh <br />
<br />
/rant off<br />

<br />
I don't see the big problem. Gives them something to talk about besides how boring it is to do nothing else but nuke and port.<br />
<br />
And clerics something to whine about cause we can't nuke, port, quad kite etc etc  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Give the wizzies a break and let them do the one thing they are good at. LOADS of FAST damage. Saves me a fortune in buffing after each Sontalak wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a list out there of what all the common abbreviations are?<br />
<br />
I, for one, do not think that this spoils the fun if the game at all.  I think it adds to it.  A group off all Wizards can go out, maybe hiring a cleric and an enchater, and causing serious mayhem sounds cool.  In D&amp;D, some friends and I had always thought of doing something like this.  Having an all Magic User party go out and adventure just sounds cool beyond words.<br />
<br />
Think about it: it's like going out with all your college buddies and doing something with your weekend.  (Wizards are schooled int casters, so the anaology isn't too bad.)  They take a long a friend in pre-med and their, uh, &quot;supplier&quot;, and they are all set.<br />
<br />
I have been in groups with various mixes: all casters, all melees, odd mixes, etc.  It all adds to the flavor.  None of them were raids, mind you, but the fact that people are doing non-standard things with raids makes me feel good.<br />
<br />
I will agree with you that the 72 hour AA rez thing is bogus beyond words.  That's just wrong.  72 hours IN GAME might make sense.  What's the point of having an ability in game (game is an element of the supposed to be fun set) that you can't use?  Or use so unoften as... well... this.  Someone isn't thinking clearly, there.  I'd make them cycle every 15 minutes, like the Invun line, but I'm called a scary little man by many in real life.<br />

Good job on that kill.  Doesn't bother me at all that 12 of the highest level wizzards get together and take a dragon down.  It's not like Sontalak had never been killed befor.  <br />

<br />
What if the guy next to you who logged in 1 hour before Rage spawned called in these 12(overkill) MB Wizards. They can get there MUCH faster then you normal raid could. He would then get Ragefire and leave you twiddling your thumbs.<br />
<br />
PLUS who is to stop them from coming MBing Ragefire down and selling the Heart for MQ??<br />
<br />
In another post that I will link when I find it again they have already started to MB all the Kunark dragons with the hopes of selling off the Epic parts and spells.<br />

MB=Good for helping raids...<br />

MB=Bad(for everybody else) for making 20~30kpp per kill.<br />

<br />
What I foresee with this unresistible and fast DMG is that a group of wizards can dominate a part of the game - they can kill most of the dragons with a trickle of effort a &quot;traditional&quot; raid force would need. (and remember, wizards are good travelers too  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif )<br />

I don't mind changing tactics on mobs, when they will make it easier for all of us to kill things - what I don't like is this concentration on one class.<br />

Mana Burn is the name of the spell.<br />
<br />
Actually, it's a wizard AA ability.  It converts all a wizards mana into direct damage.  With crits, they can easily top 15k+ damage.  It has a re-use time of 144 minutes.<br />

<br />
I'll say this very politley, and very clearly. <br />
<br />
Unless you are a Wizard and understand how manaburn works, and the amount of effort that it takes to get, just keep your mouth shut and save yourself from looking like a complete idiot. <br />
<br />
I realize that nobody here is ranting to get mana burn nerfed. This is a very touchy subject for me because I'm just now getting to the point where I can gain Manaburn, and the last thing I want to do is see it get nerfed because people that don't understand it, are calling for a nerf. <br />
<br />
---- <br />
<br />
Here are some facts, Manaburn can not be quired until level 59 and even then you must spend 12 AA points in your Arch Type skills. Those 12 points MUST be put into Mental Clarity if you wish to have the fastest path to Manaburn as it requires Mental Clarity III. You can not gain Mental Clarity until level 55. <br />
<br />
To purchase Mental Clarity III you must have 6 points in General Abilities. So at this point we are at 18 points before we can even think about buying Manaburn. So once you get to 59, you must have already put 18 points into AA, then you will need yet another 5 points to buy manaburn. Now we are talking about 23 AA pointst to gain Manaburn. <br />
<br />
Now lets look into the amount of damage Manaburn really does. <br />
<br />
Manaburn takes the total amount of mana left in your mana pool and multiplies that by a random number between 1.5 and 2.0. Zedrick, being a non uber wizard just barely has 3100 mana. So when I get manaburn we are realisticly talking about 6200 damage on a manaburn. <br />
<br />
With spending as few as possible AA points on manaburn, we have not gotten Spell Casting Fury at all, so we will have about a 1 in 1000 chance of critting manaburn for 150% at most. So now we are up to 9300 damage on the rare chance that manaburn crits AND you get a 2.0 mana -&gt; damage ratio. <br />
<br />
So we'll now look at buying Spell Casting Fury to increase our maximum Manaburn damage. 2 points for SCF-1 (2% chance of crit, for 133% damage), 4 more points for SCF-2 (4% chance of crit, for 166% damage), and 6 points for SCF-3 (7% chance of crit, for 200% damage). I've now brought to our maximum damage up to 12,000 damage in the best case scenerio. Thats still less than 1/2 damage to a Kunark dragon. <br />
<br />
So here we are, we've got a wizard that has taken the time to get to 60, spent 35 AA points and now has a 7% chance to crit for double damage. Lets become uber and gain Spell Casting Fury Master. 3 points for SCFM-1 (10% chance to crit for 200%), 6 points for SCFM-2 (12% chance to crit for 200%), and 9 points for SCFM-3 (14% chance to crit for 200%). <br />
<br />
We are now at 53 AA points for a fully uber Manaburn wizard. But this still means nothing if you don't have the base mana pool for the conversion. You have to take into consideration that the wizards that are getting Manaburn crits for 18000 dmg have a mana pool of rougly 4500 mana. That is a huge mana pool. The wizards that are getting this kind of mana are in uber guilds, and that same uber guild could just come in and take down the dragon on their off time anyway. If a guild can get this many manaburn wizards together in one spot to do this kind of thing, then hell,they could do the encounter anywhere. <br />
<br />
Do people fail to realize that Manaburn takes your mana from FULL to EMPTY in the 6 seconds it takes to cast? Do people fail to realize that this ability can be used once every 2 game days. <br />
<br />
<br />
---- <br />
<br />
On another note, Ragefire is a Kunark dragon and only has 32k hp. He could easily be done with fewer than 12 manaburn wizards, but then again we've seen how fast guilds on Tunare can move when something they want is up and it's unrealistic to assume that just because wizards can port directly into Skyfire, that they can amass a force of Manaburn wizards (That have manaburn available to use even) in less time and simply Manaburn Ragefire. <br />
<br />
-- <br />
<br />
People need to stop bitching about manaburn because they heard from a guildie who's got a friend on another server who knows a bard that knows a wizard that was in a manaburn squad that took down some kunark dragon and started farming him. This skill can only give SMALLER guilds like OURS the ability to do dragons we have not yet been able to do. This ability gives the middle level guilds the ability to COMPETE with uber guilds on content that has been TRIVIAL to them for over a year now.<br />

It puts the numbers out there and lets everyone know exactly how hard it is to get to the point of being an &quot;uber manaburn wizard.&quot;  <br />
<br />
It still does not address the issue of Uber guilds farming epic pieces for cash.  As has been done on Drinal.  Yes, the encounter is trivial to the uber guild that can field several of these wizards. But now, a group of MB wizzies port in to zone, burn down Dragon_001 (Gore being the favored example for factions issues), auction the loot (to include epic pieces) wait a bit, rinse and repeat.  Beats a Ginsu steak knife for ease and convenience.  (Sure not all are as easy as Gore, but for the purposes of example...)<br />

<br />
Yup used wrong term sorry.<br />
<br />
I have been playing Eq for 2 years, I have 3 character all in their 50's now and if I add up all the exp, AA exp and throw in the exp sitting on my 3 baby alts, I don't add up to one mana burn Wizzard.  It amazes me that this upsets anyone.  There are enough hours invested in the 12 wizzards that they should be able to just exactly what they did.<br />
<br />
On a seperate note I'm not sure what my fight heal record is but I'm betting it's higher then the mana burn efficiency and not near the time investment.<br />
<br />
Want to realy freek I think you will see a group of rangers do this some day.  I will say good Job.<br />
<br />
BTW my Wizzard is now level 2, just dinged, only 2.4 years of hard core playing to go.</div></div><hr />

Hooray for wizards as far as I am concerned. If you really look at it they can probably do more damage with those AA's in crits over time than one MB, crit or no crit. It's bonus is Fast damage which has it's uses and can do some really nice stuff when MB wizards get together but, over all, I don't see it as really unbalancing. My only regret is cleric class AA's suck and I wish VI had put more thought into ours (this goes for many other class AA's as well). <br />

<br />
No, not in the slightest. If you have spent the time to get to level 60 and get all those AA points why shouldn't you be able to smoke stuff super fast? Why should monsters ALWAYS overpower the players and why should you always have to have 30+ people just to kill something? Verrant lacks imagination when it comes to encounters and when people figure out the best (fastest and safest) way to do an encounter their only reaction is to either nerf the players or give the mobs more HPs or do extra damage. Thats not fun.<br />
<br />
What they should do is put more thought into the monsters. Make specialty zones, maybe even zones where ONLY a certain class or classes can enter. Have mobs that look the same and have the same name but have different strengths and weaknesses and you have to figure them out as the battle progresses. Have mobs that change in the middle of a fight. There's more to fighting than just toe to toe with a monster.<br />
<br />
And here's an idea, maybe get those useless GMs to actually flex their creative muscles and run quests. And i'm not talking those lame GM events they have where they slaughter newbies until the high levels come around. I'm talking scripted out stories done at random with GMs in the monsters so they can intereact with the players.<br />
<br />
It would have been a nice feature of the game if everyone would at some point in  their career be the &quot;lead&quot; character in a scripted story. Nothing massive, but one day a GM would come to you as an NPC and tell you to assemble a group of friends to help him in a quest or something.<br />
<br />
There are so many possibilities out there but the only one's you can blame are VI for being so unimaginative and us for not speaking up about it. Rant boards are nice, but until everyone sticks together and tells VI &quot;hey we'd like to see this&quot; they're not gonna care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">06-22-2002, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is fairly high on the uber scale and has 5 manaburn wizards. All we have to do to kill any kunark dragon is to get 4 of them together and keep them alive for 6 seconds while we kill the mob. What this works out to in reality is that everyone else is there to get them to the mob and distract it for a few seconds.<br />
<br />
It's pretty simple for a wizard to get the AA to get to that level, given the large percentage of kills they get on raids and the ever-popular AE groups.<br />
<br />
I have no complaint about their ability. This is the kind of thing that a mass of top-level wizards should be able to do. My only complaint would be that we as clerics get nothing anywhere near as useful, our AA skills SCM excepted pretty much suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make is so that even is a 50% chance to resist, + 5% chance for every level the caster is above the mob, and -10% for every level the casters is below the mob.<br />
<br />
MB should be a huge asset to the wizard who has it, but the current system is a tad overpowered and does make certain encounters trivial.</div></div><hr />

The amount of work involved in being MB capable is huge and I think it's about time wizzies got something nice. <br />
Which is more powerful...a MB wizzie or a cleric with CHeal? A player can be at 1 HP and I can heal him completely, no matter his total HPs. And it's a very short recast time. I'd much rather see CHeal removed from the game instead of MB. Cheal takes alot less work to get and has changed the game for the worse (IMHO) more than MB ever could. Or maybe they should make Cheal have the same effort to get as MB, and the same effects (IE: burning all your manna in one shot).<br />

<br />
CH only heals for what a tank has in HPs, not including rune type additions. The max any tank I've ever heard of having is around 7K. MB does an INSTANT 15k of damage. For mobs that take 200+ per hit and can hit 3-4 times per round, CH is neccesity. ALSO a tank with enough HPts to live for 10 seconds under those conditions in a neccessity. So CH is only as good as the person you're casting it on. You'll never see a cleric soloing with CH as a primary tactic. <br />
<br />
MB is only overpowering due to its lack of drawbacks. CH has servere drawbacks (10 sec recast, its healing effectivness is directly based on the targets max hpts, and due to these two things its limited use to heal its caster while under attack). MBs only drawback is that it uses up all your mana, but DANG you do a TON of damage potentially. The counter drawback is that you can immediately ModRod your mana back and be back in there nuking again. <br />
<br />
Its really NOT that bad a skill, just make it so there is more risk involved in useing it. Heck make it take all but 1 hp during its cast, at least that way the caster has to get healed before they can Mod Rod back to nuking mana.<br />
<br />
In general Wizzies NEED this kind of skill. It really makes sence that they are the high yield nukers, but make them need more support when using the skill.<br />

So bear with me while i attempt to interperate it for those who are a little slow and like to resort to insults when they don't take the time to read and understand what someone is saying.<br />
<br />
The numbers between MB and CH are not comparable and this is not what Berly was getting at. What he was trying to put across was that the amount of effort it takes to get manaburn is far greater than the amount of effort needed to get complete heal, and both of these spells/abilities have a huge effect on the game.<br />
<br />
What might be better is to make CH an AA ability. Maybe something similar to the paladin's lay on hands ability with a large refresh time like 72 mins. Or like the MB ability and have it heal X amount of hitpoints per point of mana. As it is now, complete heal is outa whack and it hurts us more than helps us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanx</div><div class="date">07-23-2002, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A MB capable wizzie could do 4x or even 8x the damage with thier full mana than if they just MB a mob, what would it matter if they got aggro from MB anyway? they have no mana and its highly unlikely they will get full mana anytime soon, mana robe has that 1.5 sec cast time, nowhere would you raid using MB that can use manastone, and if you mod rod to full mana, you'll prolly die from low health aggro anyway (considering all wizzies trade off any and all gear for mana items since MB is based on your mana pool ).<br />
<br />
The problem isn't with MB, it isn't all that powerful. And if it is considered so, then so be it, as you progress in this game you are supposed to gain more and more power, that means you can do things you couldn't do b4.<br />
<br />
PPl needed 30+ 40+ ppl to raid vox when she first appeared, now she can be done with 10 good twinks. PPL needed more players than can fit in VS's room to kill him, now he can be done with 1 or 2 groups or 3 MB wizzies and a few others. <br />
<br />
It's all progression, its the reward you get for progressing and making something of your character, just that wizzies have banded together and made a good use out of one of their AA skills and have made it rather renowned as THE wizzie AA skill.<br />
<br />
It may also be due to the fact that VI, didn't do so well in the AA catagory. Some ppl got really great AA skills (pally/sk wizzies enchanters rangers necros ) and some others go diddly. I mean myself for example, when they said only monks would get x3 attack upgrade and not rangers i thought i would never do any damage comparable to rogues/monks... now i do more sustained non aggro DPS than your regular rogue with epic / primal spear... again its all progression.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSmiter</div><div class="date">07-23-2002, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aean, I read, and I understood. It STILL isn't accurate!<br />
<br />
1. Effort is pointless. This is a game, so 1 person playing to level 60 does NOT qualify as &quot;hard work&quot; its all the same button pushing! L60 doesn't authorize you to play outside the normal rules of the game. Heck we'll all get to L60 some day, then what? If every wiz in EQ had MB (which given enough time, MB WILL become as common as every other spell in the game)what fun would it be? VI will just need to make mobs MORE tough to compensate for MB just like they've made them hit harder to compensate for CH.<br />
<br />
2. CH is a part of the game now. If they took away CH, MOST of the highest level zones would be unplayable. I could easily see making the mana cost of CH variable though. That would be about the only possible change I could see happening. Then the spell cost and value would both increase as the amount it healed would increase. It also makes sence that a L29 cleric should not be able to heal 7000 hpts on a buffed L60 warrior as easily as he could heal 2k on a L29 warrior.<br />
<br />
3. What was your point again? The two are NOT comparable. CH is limited to healing only what the target has avalable in hpts, and that IS far less than 15K. The majority of the time, CH is of absolutely NO use to the person casting it. It is a utility spell primarily used to insta heal a tank who can last long enough in melee. <br />
<br />
My point was never that MB should be removed or even nerfed in a great way. My point was that 1) MB and CH are not in the same category of useage, and 2)MB just needs 1 thing to make it at least a risk to use. MB agro should be instantly proportionate to the damage it does. A 15K MB should get the instant and long term attention of whatever it hits.</div></div><hr />
