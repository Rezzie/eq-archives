<br />
THIS ZONE ROCKS!!!<br />
<br />
I was there in 2 different groups this weekend at the Frontier Mountains zone/plateau thing: <br />
1.  42 cleric (me), 36 monk, 39 druid.  We were nonstop pulling.  1 bub xp in 2 hours.  I was chain-stunning, buffing, and laying down the occ. heal (never over 40 mana), and the druid was primary healer and SOWer.  This was a fun, fast-paced way to play over the traditional heal-med-buff-heal-med-buff way of life.<br />
2. 42 cleric (me), 38 enchanter, 37 wizard, 36 druid, 35 druid, and 44 paladin.  Paladin was pulling nonstop, i was chain-stunning (oh, how i love these spells against the hard-hitting MOBs), one druid was primary healer, other druid was DOTting, wizard was just a mana cannon, and the enchanter was performing crack duties and mana cannoning.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  2 bubs of experience in about 4 hours. <br />
<br />
I am bound at this location for at least the next two levels.  44 doesn't seem that far away now...<br />
<br />
Only trauma associated with this zone are the wandering Dragoons.  Quad attack for 137 damage, and really just don't like us wee halflings...  So when you hear your neighborhood tracker /ooc &quot;Dragoon to FM Zone&quot; - be SOWed or Jbooted, cuz if they hit a member of your party, be prepared to boogie.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Numinata</div><div class="date">07-14-2000, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have noticed that there tends to be a definite ghosting problem in the Overthere, sometimes resulting in the inability to see MObs or even one's own party. This effect can sometime last for half a battle. Many people have been complaining about this problem for the past two visits I've made to that zone. The xp still rocks, tho=)<br />
