<br />
I just dinged 30 in Paw in SK as a Human Cleric of Rodcet Nife on Druzz Ro.  First character, main, etc.  Highest level cleric in new-ish guild (read: no uber help) ...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm ass poor and my gear is fairly poor.  My 3 best pieces were giveaways from higher levels: Zaharn's Coronet (head) +3str +25mana; Crystal Covered Shroud ac12 +4str +4wis +4int; boots o' the reliant...<br />
<br />
Basically, for right now I'm willing to sacrifice exp for better gear and/or cash to buy better gear with. My regular group is all in their late twenties so if I go anywhere they can't I will have to go in a pick-up group.  <br />
<br />
Any thoughts or ideas on where to go / what to hunt?  I'd really appreciate it.  Thanks.<br />

<br />
Hunt over near the gnomes, but fighting gobos and you have a convenient place to sell off all the FS and Bronze that drops. If they had a bank, it would be perfect.<br />
<br />
High Hold Keep is another option to consider here-again because of the conveniently located bank and merchants.<br />
<br />
Ringmail, though not insanely common, drops off the orcs and gnolls in HHP often enough to be worth &quot;farming&quot; it-and sells for as much as 20P or so on some pieces.<br />
<br />
Or get together about 200P and head to your server's market area and become a trader. Just make sure ya spend some time learning the prices things go for so you are always trading up in value. It's boring, but it works.<br />
