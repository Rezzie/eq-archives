<br />
Okay, so I'm a dwarven (beardless) female cleric in full gold plate with a EBM and CGS. Yes, I may look cool (although nothing like as cool as I would in EM (ooh one day I shall get there), but that makes me look good, even then it's not that uncommon. <br />
<br />
Call me cute, adorable, lovely, cool, sweet cuddly, whatever you want! But hottie is just so cras and vulgar, it makes me feel sick!<br />
<br />
Sorry to all you american sorrority types out there, but I'm from the UK and round here we like to treat people like people not objects with related temperatures  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any dwarf, with a good upbringing who was raised by his clan, would treat you with the respect you deserve. If a dwarven male was the source of this crass remark, then he must have been raised by outcasts from good dwarven society... or far worse by Orcs.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that you are indeed a pure vision of womanly beauty, even girded by the instruments of Battle.<br />
<br />
/ooc It is a shame that so many of my fellow American countrymen take for granted that only Americans play EQ. Cultural tunnel vision is a handicap for them it seems... but in the end it is their loss.<br />

To Thortak-  My druid dislikes being called a &quot;hottie&quot; also. And I am American.  But being perma-sowed, she is not around long enough to react :P<br />

<br />
I guess us dwarf women are sort of hotwater bottle shaped but it's not kind to draw attention to that sort of thing!<br />
<br />
And...we aren't fat! We're just, um, well built.<br />

As a Dwarven Male, I cannot keep the Wood Elf women off me. They get one look at my flowing blond beard &amp; robust body and they faint from passion. I just can't understand it. Everywhere I go, the women chase me &amp; grab my arse. It gets so annoying. Have you ever had to run from a female ogre. /gag. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I spoted a Euridite female the other day. Wow. Holy Wow. Incredible. Delicious. Fanshmabulous. She of course, was all over me. But, it is just the Dwarven charm that I have been cursed with.<br />

Ho hum. I feel your pain.<br />

<br />
A &quot;incredibly Sensual Cleric&quot; is good.<br />
A &quot;Undeniably attractive Cleric&quot; works well.<br />
A &quot;Completely tempting and faith challenging figure of beauty&quot; may be a bit miuch, depending.<br />
A &quot;living tribute to Erollisi Marr in all of her glory&quot; may also be a bit much, but also can work well.<br />
<br />
Giving her a flower (say, frosty datura from the yeti you mugged in the dreadlands just for this occasion) and not saying one word, and then following up with /peer, /whistle, and then /grin works VERY well.  If you get a good response follow it up with /stare.<br />
<br />
emotes work better, IMO.<br />
<br />
Personaly, I pefer Dark elves, high elves, humans and wood elves myself.<br />
<br />
High elves work nicely in mithril armor, dark elves in the gold, wood elves in as little or possible or that clingy leather look.  Dark haired humans look incredible in the purple.<br />
<br />
but I am a letch ;-)<br />
