<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to rant..<br />
<br />
Ok, I'm 51st (no!  52nd!!) and I accompanied a few of my friends, and another group into Chardok the other night.<br />
<br />
There were originally 4 clerics, but one left (it took us quite a while to get ready, our enchanter and ranger went LD for a while, etc.).  We finally got inside, and started clearing the way.<br />
<br />
We were originally the only group there.  While we were outside, another cleric (whose name I *should* post, to protect the innocent) asked if we had an opening.  Didn't really know her, but I figured it couldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
So they got the tank, while we had a necro, mage and enchanter.  They had 2 clerics.<br />
<br />
So, after our other ranger left (he's 53, the one who stayed is 44), this other cleric decides *she's* going to pull.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, after she got my husband killed trying to help her with the massive train of death she brought, I had to rez her.<br />
<br />
So we set the other ranger to pull.  He sent me a tell a few minutes afterwards asking me for buffs, because this other cleric just wouldn't do it.<br />
<br />
I buffed him to the gills.<br />
<br />
Everything went ok for a while.  But I begin to notice that this cleric is not healing AT ALL.  The other cleric in the group is doing everything, and when she is aggroed *I'm* the one keeping her alive.  <br />
<br />
The other cleric then says &quot;zoning&quot; and leaves for 20 minutes while she zones out to REFRESH HER JBOOTS.  in the middle of a fight, no less.<br />
<br />
About this time, the dwarf cleric (Allyy, she is way cool) and I begin /telling each other.  I tell her I'll help her keep our ranger alive, and her.  My group is mostly pets anyway. <br />
<br />
So the amazing wonder idiot then proceeds to do a few more of the &quot;oops!  tee hee, I forgot to heal!&quot; things, got the ranger, Allyy, and their mage killed.<br />
<br />
At this point, my husband and I are completely fuming, as is our necro, who politely asks if we can go to BW instead.<br />
<br />
Anyone else seen this?  This was a 53rd level cleric in a good amount of EM armor.  How do people this stupid level so quickly and have such good reputations?  How do they find groups?  Talking to another person our idiot cleric trained in Chardok, she said &quot;watch it, she got us killed a lot in Guk.&quot;<br />

IMHO, clerics are born, not fabricated.  All of us who play clerics to some extent have the desire to do what clerics do.  If we didn't, we would all be necros  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Thanks, Salina.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I do the best I can to keep the party alive while entertaining those around me.  <br />
<br />
I have had a bad Fare experience myself.  was showing some friends Sebilis for the first time.  She was zone pulling for her group, and proceeded to drag the mob thru my group (which was sitting quietly on a corner of the ramp medding).  Mobs aggroed on us.  She proceeded to start meleeing them right there, rather than attempt to a) nuke em off or b) get her tank to maybe~~~TAUNT????~~~~~.  Meanwhile, I'm getting beaten like a redheaded step child.  We ended up evaccing out, minus one shammy who took the death for us. I gate back to TT to res him, zone in, and see her party all dead.  <br />
<br />
So I decide to be nice and res em after I get my supershammy back up, minus her.  They're all extraordinarily grateful for the res.  She then zones in and starts cranking at me for not ressing her.<br />
<br />
LOL!  Same res (she's 53, I'm 51)...  Please, let me spend my mana on ressing you when you can do it yourself.<br />

See, during the day, the father plays the character, and is very good at it.  But in the evening, the son plays the cleric... and the son is a complete and total IDIOT.  I've had the misfortune of grouping with him twice, and the burden of being the cleric in the group after him.  After he leaves I'm begged for buffs, heals, and this wave of &quot;Thank god a REAL cleric!&quot;.  This cleric doesn't heal.. or when he does, it is usually 2 minutes after you have died.. he doesn't buff.. you ask him &quot;Mana?&quot; and you get an answer 5 minutes later... the guy just isn't there!<br />
<br />
I've grouped with some other bad clerics... some I know were given their account by a friend... Those are the ones that scare me, and the ones that really don't last long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Laurisia.  Same thing that happened to you in Sebilis, basically.<br />
<br />
She was down there soloing, and my husband the enchanter zoned in before I did.  She immediately asked him for &quot;help&quot; getting a single to pull.  He &quot;helped&quot; her by mezzing them.. then she proceeded to solo it basically.  And when I zoned in, she invited me.  I declined, and kept a close eye on my husband.  When the rest of our 5-man group got in, my husband disbanded.  Then a druid came in (yay!) and we invited him.. right before she tried.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Sorry - she was truly an atrocious puller, and as far as I'm concerned, in a place like Sebilis, the healer (if there is only one) should not be pulling - who heals the healer?<br />

<br />
I think that the reason you see Clerics like that isn't always easily dismissed by saying &quot;eBay&quot;, &quot;twink&quot; or &quot;friend playing it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I play as an enchanter.  Over the course of time I have developed an arch-enemy of sorts, a person who is quite possibly one of the worst enchanters and players in general I've ever seen.  He is a kill stealer extraordinare, a farmer, and a jerk.  His behavior is fairly well known since he has been at it for the life of his character.  Even after a typical incident with this guy in LGuk one night in which he walked in, charmed a named creature our group was fighting and took it back to his group to get the kill, members of my guild who knew about the incident were grouping with him the next day.  He is also now several levels higher than me and now fully decked out in planar gear.  <br />
<br />
The bottom line about classes like clerics and enchanters is that they have abilities people want so badly that some are willing to group with those classes regardless of their player's reputation.  I certainly know it is the case with this enchanter, people want clarity so badly it doesn't matter to them how skillful or honest a person he is.  I'm sure the same holds true for clerics, whose healing ability (even if they don't use it) and ressurects are highly sought after. <br />
<br />
It is truly unfortunate when simply being a member of a certain class seems to excuse even the worst of behavior and make it so easy to find groups   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had a similar experience, on a smaller scale than yours.  In my younger days I was in a group fighting HGs in rathe mountains.  In comes the pull, and we had the giant down to 80% health or so when in waltzes a enchanter, who charms the giant away from us.  I'm pretty mad, but in a moment of clarity I mem cancel magic and hit the giant with it.  Giant breaks charm, smacks the enchanter a few times, then comes back to resume his unfinished business with us as our tanks taunt him off.  We didn't have any further problems that evening...<br />

<br />
Unfortunately in my case by the time I had fully realized what was going on (had my back to him mesmerizing some spawns) the creature was already dead!  He was grouped with a wizard and two clerics who opened fire with their best DDs on it when he broke his charm.  Not to mention when I did figure out what was going on I didn't stay anywhere near as lucid as you did, so I wasted precious cancel magic/charm/memory blur time  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

My husband is one of the best I know.. and he has an arch-enemy too   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  Same M.O. too..  Except this guy enjoys soloing in the Karnor's entrance (inside that is).  He brings something out, then roots whatever extra is left right next to other groups.<br />
<br />
My husband has taken to charming the guy's rooted mobs.  The guy got really angry and started yelling - my husband calmly (he's so lucky, I'm  NEVER calm) told him the next time he rooted a mob near our group, it would be charmed again.<br />
<br />
Jerks.  I really really really hate them.<br />
<br />
You're an enchanter - have you noticed that enchanters tend to be super arrogant?  I know about 3 who aren't utterly full of themselves, but that's it.<br />
<br />
(And as an aside, I saw a 60th level enchanter in FV selling Donal's sleeves for 10k... am I wrong to think he's a weiner?  He's in the Bertoxx uber guild...)<br />

Salina, you silly, you've brought up the Bertoxxulous uber guild topic ....<br />
<br />
There are some fine citizens of that guild, but it is amazing how they have a habit of ...<br />
<br />
... covering their ears, closing their eyes, and shouting ALL IS WELL, when others bring legitimate discussions about their actions to their attention.<br />
<br />
In their defense, other &quot;less uber&quot; guilds do much the same, perhaps merely in not equal volume due to smaller size or other factors.  I believe the issues and problems are part of the overall guild syndrome which is amplified by uberguilds since such a guild can swing their weight around more.<br />

<br />
Well, yes.. I think I know 2 people in that guild I don't think are weiners.<br />
<br />
I have had first hand experience with them, however.<br />
<br />
Went to Chardok for the first time, my group was right about 50th or so (47-53 about).<br />
We knew it was a one-way, and decided to head to the zone so we could get our bearings (had never been).<br />
<br />
That guild's members were there, and had 2 more groups coming with which to go deeper in.  Instead of sharing the exit zone area (and we were polite), they flat out told us that we could NOT sit there.<br />
We moved back to the entrance area zone, I didn't feel like making a big conflict.  I figured we had a druid, so if it got bad we could evac.<br />
After their third group went it, they sat just in front of us.  We politely asked them to stay to the side so we wouldn't train them.  They got nasty, they intentionally trained us, pulling 5 or so janissaries, and a couple of templars, then evacing right as they got to us.<br />
Needless to say, I have very little good to say about that guild.  Their actions in the past have not done anything to make me believe they are anything but a group of ex-Quake clanners (which they are) who have found what they think is some kind of societal status symbol.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the rant... I just get very angry when I'm treated with disrespect like that.<br />

I would have been hopping mad.  Chardok is a zone that everyone should play Very Nice in.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Last night, I took 2 groups of guildies to Chardok, and we had a blast.  Every cleric  in the guild above level 35 now has a copy of Death Pact.  /wink<br />
<br />
However, I've been in that zone before with people who don't get that there are at least 2-3 different pull spots without leaving the zone in/out U thingie.  Trains can be quite catastropohic in there.<br />
<br />
Tell ya what - we need to form a cleric's night out in Chardok.  All the Bertoxx clerics on here get to pick their favorite group (sissy-slap-fight over Clair, I know) and we just munch through that zone....<br />

A while back, a 56th level cleric (name withheld) figured out that he could pull the Lord room in Guk single (due to his level, mainly).<br />
She saw him.<br />
She thought she could emulate him.<br />
And so, for the last year or so, she has the strong personal belief that she should/can/must pull.<br />

<br />
I was hunting in Karnors and a gnome runs up to me asking for buffs.  I give him buffs  and he gives me clarity 2.  A few minutes later he comes back, this time needing a heal.  I heal him and he starts explaining.  It turned out that his group's cleric wasn't buffing or healing anyone in the group, and this enchanter was actually having to pull!  The poor guy was having to come to me to get healed after every fight!  Needless to say his group kicked the cleric not long after.<br />
<br />
side note: frankly I think our server would be by far better off if we didn't have to deal with that guild and thier childish behavior....<br />

My husband the enchanter is one of the better pullers I know, especially in places like the Hole where he can pull anything with ease (except those stupid rats from hell).<br />
<br />
He does well, but he's a caster, and no amount of hit point buffs will make him a tank..    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  He pretends sometimes.<br />

Although I am only level 40, I have been playing EQ for over a year and 1/2 and have been in the midst of many debates ranging from AC to tactics etc and as I was reading this I thought that maybe the perspective of an up and coming 50's Cleric may have value.  Anyway, I see these &quot;wonder Clerics&quot; as a by-product of the main reasons (IMHO) that EQ is stagnating, it is no longer the &quot;fun&quot; factor that drives some, but rather the &quot;kelwnness&quot; or monetary stature that can be accumulated.  All those players that have no idea how to use tact or be nice, or recognize what purple name tags mean, have to grow up, and what do they grow up to be....the very Clerics you are describing.  I see them daily, I refuse to group with them and their friends because 1.  Its not fun, 2.  I dont like to die because someone cant or wont do the job they are in the group for, and 3.  Because by 40 or so levels, having to ask them to save the mana, to use taunt, to buff and so forth shouldnt be the focus of my group says.  So I guess what Im getting at is that some players who are high levels cannot play there characters when it comes down to specific tactics and strategies and while to them, its all about &quot;killing stuff dood&quot;, it sounds like those of us on this board are the ones who have fun saving that big Ogre with a CH, or giving the 14 Warrior a Symbol and Armor, or taking part in highly developed and specialized tactics that require knowledge, teamwork, and enjoyment of doing it with others, because its fun.  ACK, guess I went off there, but it has always amazed me that some Clerics can get so high in level and simply not be able to keep their groups alive.  (again, this is my opinion, right or wrong  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">10-30-2000, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in complete agreement.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  It still boggles my mind that people who frankly SUCK that much can a.) ever get a group and b.) make a level higher than 6.<br />
<br />
I expect some mistakes from people - I made them when I was learning the trade.  But ya know, after nearly two years of playing this game, I have a pretty good handle on what I'm doing.  Which is why it hurts me to see people, especially healer classes, who wouldn't know their butt from a greater heal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bluetote001</div><div class="date">11-01-2000, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I doubt that many of the clerics that do not heal are ebay clerics or playing a friends cleric. Seems to me an ebay cleric or someone playing their friends cleric would be scared ****less and be on their toes the whole time.. that's the way I was when I played my friends cleric in Sebilis. The ebay clerics are the ones who don't know what spells do what, and when to stun, or what buffs to throw out. Usually the ones that don't heal are extremely tired or just plain dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tend to step on each other's toes too much no matter how we communicate who's doing what.  (It was a caster heavy group with only 1 tank.)  Our tank overpulled, I was doing a res for some idiot, and the other cleric was in charge of watching our SK.  He started the CHeal too late, I looked at the SK's bar and started a Remedy, but it was too late  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
*sigh*  I think I'm more on my toes with only me as primary healer.  <br />

I'm a new cleric (I did have a high elf level 10 cleric but recreated a human cleric now at level 6).  I guess I'm replying because I don't want to become one of the clerics mentioned on this board  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I haven't grouped that much but I try my best.  HOpefully when I reach higher levels I will be more adept and keeping the group alive than some others.  Anyway just thought I'd introduce myself and I'm always open to advice  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Keep reading these boards. Everything you need to become a great cleric is here. Learn from those who came before you as I did and you can't go wrong. The Clerics who are ranted about in this thread had no such guidance... and as such have not grasped the art and dedication it takes to play a Cleric in EQ.<br />

<br />
But personally, I get pissed at anyone that can't play their class well, unless they're maybe level 15 and under - and at that level, how hard is it to play your class?   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
I feel like I know half of you from readin your posts as I grew from a young silly cleric to the older silly cleric I am today.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Thanks to so many of you for your useful info and suggestions.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to post sorta responding to Mag's thoughts on being a better healer when there isn't a back-up healer...<br />
<br />
For the longest time I would have completely agreed with that.  Recently though I've moved in with my boyfriend - druid.  We group together a lot and he's back-up healer.  There's no rush like what our groups can handle now since we can coordinate our heals in real time.  Or if we're on a guild raid in different parties, often we both pri heal for our group.  I can watch both screens at the same time and throw heals when needed.  <br />
<br />
Last night the bard song made me autotarget her (GRRR I hate that, remind me to rant about it sometime) and I started a sup on her instead of the monk that NEEDED it.  I shouted HEAL THE MONK! and he did it, so there wasn't a death during my recast refresh time. <br />
<br />
It's just sooooo fun and handy I HAD to post about it.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
It will only contribute to slowing the mob kills rate of your group.<br />
<br />
It also very boring, as you are taking away most of the fun of being the one &quot;in charge&quot; of keeping your party alive.<br />
<br />
Finally a minor element can be drop related. You really don't want to have to lotto on a Donal's armor or equivalent class items.<br />

I've often been in a two-healer group, you just have to know the right places to be cleric-heavy. (Dead-side guk is a very good place.) I've been hunting there with a group composition that most clerics seem to despise...a pair of clerics, a pair of rangers, and either a pair of enchanters or one chanter and one rogue. That group held the frenzy room for around 6 hours easily, and we got two sashes out of the mix. <br />

<br />
We were able to handle more mobs at one time then I've ever had.<br />
4 bodyguards, construct of sathir, and a few other assorted mobs which kept spawning.<br />
<br />
I believe that clerics are pretty much tough to kill and with 2 of them...you can do wonders.<br />
