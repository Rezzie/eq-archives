<br />
I would wait until 29 to go there if a small group, and 24 if you want to just be a healer for the most part.</div></div><hr />

Just traded the Foreman's Tunic I earned and some cash for a Charred Guardian Shield, +9 Wis, ummmm...! Refuse to get a Moulton Cloak, though, dwarves should not wear an item that had to be obtained by killing a gnome.<br />
<br />
But -- I wish I had come at level 27 or so. Many mobs are green to me, such as Cinder Goblins, and about half of Flames, and *everything* else is blue (haven't con'ed the Gob King, yet). Had I come a little earlier, xp would be better.<br />
