I am currently hunting in Dreadlands at 40 and exp is pretty fast there, but loot is almost zero, so I wonder if anyone has hunted in Velious and can tell me of some good spots for a mid 40s level. With the new Symbol spell cash becomes a matter again, with spending 500pp for 2 stacks of Peridot, and this is my main char, so no sponsoring possible... Besides I prefer groups to solo, but any posts are sure welcome...<br />

Pinzarn should be fine, I almost never use even that one for exp groups.)<br />
At 40 you should be able to handle the first few floors of the Tower of Frozen Shadow, the stuff around the bridge in Iceclad may still be blue (I'm thinking it was back at 42 but don't recall), ulthorks or the giant or orc fort in East wastes, or go to Great Divide to hunt giants, wurms or tizmaks (maybe, I seem to recall they were greening out).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The kodiaks will all be blue to you in your 40's, but compared to DL, the exp just flows... now there isnt much loot in the kodiak caves, but if you are looking for a place to break through 40, and up to 43.. then those kodiak caves are phenomenal...<br />
<br />
if you want loot, then hunt Crystal Caverns, or hunt the orc fort in Eastern Wastes... a cleric can get a group easily with these people.. but in my experiences, the exp itself is not very forthcoming.... <br />
<br />
Geonids in Crystal Caverns DO offer both good exp AND good loot though... but they are usually VERY camped...<br />
