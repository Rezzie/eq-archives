</FONT><HR>I probably have posted on this subject more times than I would like to recall, but I like to bring it up every so often to hear what everyone's opinion is- so here goes.<P>What do most of you think of the all- powerful people in EQ allowing some method of regaining faction in PoG and Tunare for all those that want to repent.  I, for one was a cleric that as amazing as it may sound, took a bunch of faction hits in PoG right after it was found, and was unaware that there would be no way of restoring it.  Would some kind of pentance, quest, or mob killig be too much to ask to regain this lost faction.. <BR>And before all those flames come to me about I should have known  better, please let me state I was unaware that the faction hits were unrepairable, that they would effect quests from that zone, and that my cleric guild would love to kill me.  I entered the plane with two groups that I had not been with before, and recieved no loot or exp from my time there..which was very short,  only bad faction.. In the meantime I havent been back to PoG. and have been working deligently on the quest armor given out from Thurguden. As almost all of us know NOW, the faction hits in Velious were really more severe than in any plane or zone in the past.. unfortunately I and I am sure others found this out the hard way.  <BR>We all have a tendancy to ramble on about balance, spells, quests, but I also think that the perception of your character in game is an important part of my enjoyment.. <P>Dusklar 59th cleric.. <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have a very simple rule regarding how I deal with faction...if it's /con is indifferent or better to me, I don't attack it...ESPECIALLY if I know it's associated with the guys who are on my side. <P>While admittedly there are a lot of useless and redundant factions in EQ (who cares about Kobold or Orc) there is a certain logic to some of it. You kill things in PoG, you should EXPECT to lose faction with Tunare and her followers. After all, it's her plane. And that faction may or may not be recoverable...one-way factions are nothing new to EQ.<P>The Bottom Line: Think twice before you kill for phAt lEwtz, it may affect you very badly down the line. And it's not Verant's fault for not telling you...it's your own.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>PS. All you elves who hunt in PoG...I cannot put my hatred for you into words. At least when an inky kills Innoruuk, there's some philosophical appeal to it, the ultimate expression of hate. An elf killing Tunare is just plain stupid if you are into any sort of RP at all.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/mad.gif"><P><P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>M&M Brewing Company<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Excuse me, but let's clarify something.<P>I'm a hammer-toting, beard-wearing, heavy-drinking, master-brewing, inky-hating, Brell-worshipping, long-memoried DWARF.<P>I'm not a pointy-eared, baby-faced, tree-hugging, no-drink-holding, can't-carry-my-own-armor, short-memoried, ungrateful-to-my-creator ELF.<P>I am a great friend to the followers of Tunare. They have been much help to me in the past, and we dwarfs remember such things even when those remembered have themselves forgotten. I have good faction in Felwithe and Kelethin, and with the Tunarean Court. I go to the PoG as a visitor, not an invader.<P>I wish I could say the same for the elves who I see hunting in PoG. It's a pity that they can't even remember their own mother and creator. I may not worship Tunare, but I respect her a far sight more than those turncoat elves do. I hope they choke on their precious loot, the lot of them.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/mad.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>M&M Brewing Company<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Guess I didn't narrow my question down enough.  Was basically asking what everyone would think of wayward high elfs being ABLE to restore their faction to PoG..   As stated in my original post, some of us went to PoG VERY early on and didn't realize the severe penalties of faction hits, and found out the hard way... At least that was what happened in my case.. And lewt wasn't the issue, but just exploring a new plane-- as I received nada from my one and only trip there.

</FONT><HR>Sadly, I feel that you reap what you sow. In this case, you went to a new plane to explore and whatnot. Great! Good for you!<P>You did NOT have to kill anything. You could have walked around all day and never aggroed anything. You CHOSE to kill there. You CHOSE to attack things that liked you. You should have realized there would be consequences.<P>I believe in pretty much the same thing as Galavant. If it doesn't attack me on sight, I don't attack it. Goblins, Orcs, Kobolds and Gnolls are fair game, as are Ogre Bouncers (they never liked me), Troll Bashers (ditto with them) and Dark Elf Guards (them too). <BR>Kerrans? They are indifferent to me and as such I am indifferent to them. PoG? They regard me warmly. Why would I go killing something that regards me warmly? You should have asked yourself that same question when you went.<P>IF Verrant ever adds a quest to raise faction with Tunare, it should be a long, tedious quest that you have to do repeatedly. It should reward you with no exp and little to no money/items. It should be a pilgrimage type quest. But don't expect it anytime soon.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Depends what faction you are worried about, if you are worried about Tunare faction then you are out of luck, but you can repair your faction with the cleric guild. I know of several people who have done it.

</FONT><HR>I think that Asbashi said it best once (I know lol)<P>'Charles Manson will always be Charles Manson no matter how many hours of community service he does.'<P>This was to explain one-way and incredibly hard to change factions.  It does make sense.  In a RP sense, if you went to PoG and killed minions of Tunare, I seriously doubt you would be able to make amends so to speak.  You are just lucky this isnt real RPing.  In some of the p&p games I have played you would lose all your clerical powers if you did that.

</FONT><HR>I am pretty much in agreement I am a human cleric of Erollissi Marr and am KOS to the freeport militia. This has come about from me doing quests with my guild to raise my faction with E Marr. Now if they were to open a plane of love and I were to go there I should be able to walk around and hail the inhabitants and bask in the glory for what I have worked for. I would never go there and kill my brothers and sisters that have moved there before me. <BR>As for being able to fix your faction sure you should be but like has been stated it should be an extremly long camp with no xp and no loot. Well maybe give you 5000 copper each time and have it at least 10 zones from any bank. It should also take doing a series of quest that get increasingly difficult not allowing you to do the earlier quests over and over. <P>------------------<BR>Trilvan Lostheart<BR>Vicar Lostheart of the church of love<BR>Markham Rosrac<BR>51st 52nd 51st Modrod handin, coldstone passin, pet a bashin, Gician</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Guess there isn't too many out there that have mercy on their fellow players.  After some of the flames I read about need before greed drops, I would have expected a little more kindness from you dikmer.  It seems everytime I bring this subject up I get flamed that I was after phat lewt.. when I already stated I didn't receive any loot at all.  And yes I did participate in killing mobs indirectly in PoG by buffing peeps up, and by healing my group, but DID NOT realize the faction hits, or the non repairability of those hits until it was too late.  You guys that jump in there and say that in other pvp games I would have been stripped of my powers, spells etc, fail to mention that in these same games you can't group with evils, or participate in quests that involve evil characters.. and as we know eq is nothing like that.  In fact the faction hits in PoG were different than in any previous plane in EQ as well.  All I am saying is it really THAT easy to sit back and  judge someone who made ONE trip, ONE mistake, and wants desparately to correct it?  Believe me I have had several invites to go back to PoG and turn them down in hopes of some kind of repentant quest to allow my to once again "walk in Tunare'e grace".   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, I just have this to say:<P>Clerics refuse to res dwarf killers and get flamed on this board.<P>I know there are clerics that were guard killers or druid killers in their day.  I know these folks have repaired faction.<P>VI put cleric and druid spells on Sifaye, on Court of Tunare faction.  This puts the RPer in the position of going without, killing the mobs themselves, or buying spells from mercenaries who have killed Tunare's minions.<P>I thoroughly enjoyed Galavant's post from an RP perspective.<P>I have been to PoG a couple times.  Explored, looked around, took a screenshot of me and Tunare.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Would you res a Dark Elf friend of yours in PoG?  If so, then .....  If not, then continue to hurl rocks.  Would you be friends with a Dark Elf?  What are the RP implications of that?  <P>I am a halfling.  My dark elf SK alt took particular joy in killing the halflings in Neriak.  Particular joy.  Tarf rarely passes up an opportunity to kill Zytl or Gix.  Some things never change.  However, Tarf remembers the wood elfs and high elfs killing guards in Misty Thicket.  Those black bears hit hard back in teh day and it was a royal pain to get to the wall only to find there were no guards.  <P>I think there are probably ways to fix any faction.  (If I keep huntign in HS, I should be warmly in Mistmoore)  And really, all the original poster would like is to know if there is any support for his idea as well as whether there is a way to do it.  As far as I am concerned, when they nerfed the BP's effect, they should have made it possible to improve faction lost.<P>I don't see a qualitative difference between being able to improve druid faction adn being able to improve Tunare faction.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Yes, I think they should have a way to improve Tunare faction, but as stated earlier it should be quite difficult.<P>How about this:<P>High Priest of Tunare:  You wish to gain favor with Our Lady?  Well to do this you must show your faith and devotion by accomplishing a small task.  Go to the heart of the Dark Elven city.  Find the blasphemous clerics guild.  Inside you must recover a crystal that was stolen from one of our smaller sanctums and return it to me.<P>Ok, now you have to first get to the clerics of Felwithe to receive this quest.  Hmmm, since you're kos you'll need a disguise.  Wolf form comes to mind (so find a druid) and zone into Felwithe.  Oops, forgot, wolf form drops when you zone, so have your druid friend zone in first.  Should be easy getting to the priest from here.<P>Now head out to the DE city (forget its name..sorry).  Getting past the newbie guards in wolf form should be easy right?  Have your druid friend zone in first as in Felwithe.  Oops forgot about the guards close to the inside zone.  You may be able to fight them off, maybe not.  After that it's wolf form again (are wolves KOS in this city?)<P>You find the guild, you locate the crystal and you get out.  Once you get back to the Felwithe priest you are rewarded with the following:<P>Increased faction to Priests of Tunare (+1)<BR>Increased faction to Tunarian Court (+1)<P>Since you're already down say -2500 this should cover the "difficult" part of regaining faction as it will take you a long time to repair it.  KEEP in mind though, that it "IS" repairable in this scenario.<P>I just think it should be fixable, no matter how dedious or repetative (like that's new to eq).<P><P>------------------<BR>Greywolffe Silverstarr<BR>52nd Cleric of Tunare<BR>E'Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I don't think there should be a way to repair it.  He should have known.  My main is a DE necro.  I refused to hunt in Mistmoore because the first kill we had hurt faction with my queen.  My queen isn't even in the game, but I was afraid one day she would be.  So, I chose not to risk it and left my friends to do something else.<P>After one kill you should have seen the faction hits and said, 'Hey, this might not be such a good idea.  Let me find out if I can fix this before I continue.'<P>And don't say you weren't after loot just because you didn't get any.  I can't think of any other reason to kill your brothers.  Just to see what killing them was like?  Just to be able to say, 'Hey! I just killed my brother!'<P>Shrug.<P>You brought up that a true RP'er wouldn't group with other races.  Well that's true.  But EQ allows that.  So, don't blame people who do it.  EQ does have an NPC faction system.

</FONT><HR>Tel.. I did see the faction hits, and left shortly afterwards, but it was too late.. The circumstances of my arrival into PoG were like this.. Group says... hey would you like to go to PoG and hunt abit?  new zone and it could be fun... we know where it is.. answer... sure.. reply.. cool.. we will CoH you across Kael, awakening lands, and to the zone in.. I say ok. but I don't know anything about any of these zones yet... reply ... np we will get you in and out... <BR>So after being called of heroed across two zones, and entering PoG for the first time, I buffed up two groups.. took about 6 faction hits from that.. then decided hey this sucks.. i won't attack or buff during battles and leave asap.. but heck let me see.. how do i get out of here.. and when I do, how do i get across awakening lands? and kael?.. and needless to say the two groups that CoH'd me were not happy when i told them I was leaveing..Some of you are thinking well you could have gated,.. I was bound just o.s. entrance to PoG.. that would not get me to safety...I could have also just camped out... but by the time I realized the faction hits I was taking I was already kos to PoG residents..so I couldn't get out even if I just camped out.   So if you all being clerics know of the pressure that is put on us daily in groups to just keep them alive in routine areas.. what do you think I was feeling and being told in this situation...?<BR>I repeat... faction hits in PoG are more severe than in any zone that I had played in or knew about previous..I didn't ever realize I would take faction hits for buffing members until I saw the messages, and after playing for 57 levels of a true blue follower, being careful of my faction hits,  I loose all my faction for one terrible trip?  Anyone that knows me on my server realizes I am not a loot hungry, power grubbing player. <BR>I learned some valuable lessons that time, and I have taken them to heart.. just a shame that I am now almost level 60, and not happy over this one foul up.. <BR>I would be glad to do some kind of trivial quest that would allow my faction to be returned.. but rite now there is no method.., but all you dark elfs keep on hunting in hate and shaking your guild leaders hands, and also continue to do all those future dark elf cleric quests.. you have that option.. unfortunately some of us high elfs that made this one mistake don't.

</FONT><HR>Meant to say Tve on last post.. and yes I can say that I went to PoG without thinking of getting any loot... I went to hate over 25 times before I finished my eth mist armor, and several times I went without receiving any loot or drops.. Since I was the junior cleric of those two groups, I wasn't expecting anything.. but I was excited about going into three new zones thatI had not been in after just getting the velious expansion.. Alot of you guys seem to forget I did this jog into PoG right after it was found, and very little info was out on my server yet about it.. <BR>Dusklar.. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006066&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006066&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
