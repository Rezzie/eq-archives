The exp was great, the drops frequent and I never went 00m until Avalanch (I assumed it was him as he /shouted &quot;Hey you guys camping the fort, why don't you clear the guards at the entrance&quot; right before he came out with the train) pulled the Chief and 4-5 Ry'Ghorr's on us while we were fighting a Snow Griffon.  MT had everyone run, but the wizzie died out of reach of my heals and I gated.  I landed with 26 hp left!  Everyone else made it out ok.<br />
<br />
Also picked up Turning of Undead!<br />
