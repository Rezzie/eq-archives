Ro.  Somehow I also managed to channel Divine barrier through going unconscious.  The spectre then went off to dice a few teens level folk in the area, so I superior healed myself and then burned him down.  I'll have to root around and try to find that scroll back screen shot.<br />

I got to the ramp near the zone entrance and was at 1 bubble of health, so I hit DB, got interupted 2x, the regained concentration after a hit for 137 damage that knocked me unconsious. DB healed me up enough, then the folks at the zone jumped the 3 frogs and got them off me so I could heal when DB went down. The only other time I regained concentration on a DB on a blow that knocked me unconcious, I had an AE DoT on me from Dracolich, so I died anyway. =/<br />
