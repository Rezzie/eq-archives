<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaelem</div><div class="date">05-31-2001, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For us, he was a monster. Normally he was an easy encounter, but now, couldn't slow, couldn't land lifetaps, etc. He went down finally, but it was a rough (albeit fun) fight.<br />
<br />
Now, the question I want to ask is I'm hearing spotty reports that some servers were able to slow him, noticed no changes, while others had the problems we had. <br />
<br />
The speculation is perhaps he is like Dain now. A &quot;hard&quot; one and an &quot;easy&quot; one (for lack of better terms). Any input from you guys?<br />

Our last kill we couldn't slow, he had Brain, Eye, Shoulders.  Which added up to 20 MR, which may have pushed him over the edge and made him immune.<br />

We got reports that he was unslowable from the folks that killed him after the first patch. My guilds alliance killed him tonight(love emergency patches) and got painfull confirmation of it, heh.<br />
Oh well, decent drops, halo, 2 choakers and a cloak. Still havn't had a robe or brain drop for us when we killed him. =/<br />

Was fun fight though, whereas fighting Innoruuk is somewhat boring...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
We got him down though and he dropped Halo, cloak and 2 chokers for us.<br />

We were unable to slow him after the patch but a few servers have reported slowing him and one slowed him when he was around 1% of his HP left.<br />
<br />
They increased his MR greatly or something is messed up with MR debuffs stacking and slowing. Hmmm maybe should try out the debuffs stacking since they did change some spells and how they stack.<br />

We were thinking at the time that the Robe he finally dropped might have boosted his MR to the point that slow could't land, but reports coming in from other servers indicate otherwise. Probably a good thing in the long run since before he was way too ez for the loot he was dropping. Dropping him unslowed was quite an accomplishment for a 5 month old non-split server IMHO.<br />
