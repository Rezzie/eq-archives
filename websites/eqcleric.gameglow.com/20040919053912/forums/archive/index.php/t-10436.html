The crypt mummies, ghouls, and dry bones can keep a solo Cleric going from lv 16 to 20 easy.  Plus the avg 5gp and bronze weapons/raw-hide armor is a nice bonus.  Just root/nuke your way thru these levels.<br />

I remember hearing stories about the entrance to South Ro from the Oasis side guarded by wandering thugs, Giants and other baddies. What would be the safest way to get there? Just dodge your way to the Oasis through North Ro, then hug the ocean shore through most of the Oasis, get SoW and/or Invis and make a run for the zone border?<br />
<br />
Any tips regarding the current situation in that part of the woods would be greatly appreciated!<br />

Just hug the ocean and when you get near the orc camp go around if you are KoS there, and then you are at South Ro, only thing to watch for are SGs who wander around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muon</div><div class="date">11-23-1999, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I made the trip to South Ro last weekend and it's not any more dangerous than it was before. Probably less so now that people are hunting Sand Giants. The only thing to worry about in the Oasis aside from regular madmen, ghouls and such is bad Spectre pulls, when Spectres leave their cozy island and start slaughtering people on the beach.<br />
<br />
But back to South Ro. Various Crypt and Shriveled Mummies are good and safe experience between 15/16 and 17 if you stay close to the Oasis zone, not to mention excellent loot for that level, but Dry Bone Skeletons will give you trouble since they will be yellow-to-red to you. At 18, you may be able to take out some of them, but expect partial and even complete resists and their Fire based attacks add up. At 19, armed with your new spells and more mana/HP/Defense, you should be able to solo them just fine.<br />
<br />
One word about the vendors in South Ro. The ones in the North-Central camp are Evil and will KoS Good races. The single vendor (and the friendly Orc who hangs out with him) in the NW corner will buy from and sell to Good races, but his prices really bite - expect a 50%+ markup/discount. You may be better off selling in the Oasis, although it is arguably more dangerous, or in North Ro, although it is a much longer run. Decisions, decisions...<br />

Ro via the OASIS these days and I followed up with a &quot;trip report&quot;. Just reread the first paragraph of my message  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huorg</div><div class="date">11-24-1999, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to be aware of if you're a Dwarf and didn't hunt dervs or orc raiders is that you will be indifferent to all the dervs and orcs in Oasis and South Ro.<br />
<br />
This means you can pick off the wandering undead with no problem and med right in the middle of the orc spawn if you want.<br />
<br />
Madmen will also be indifferent to you.<br />
<br />
One thing to watch out for is the dervish thugs.  They always scowl even if you have good derv faction and they will aggro the other dervs on you and then really mess up your faction when you kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muon</div><div class="date">11-24-1999, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a good point. It is also worth noting that the Lesser Faydark Bandits/Dervishes, which Dwarves often hunt in their low teens for Bronze weapons, are part of the Dervish faction, so, if you are a Dwarf, by the time you get to SE Antonica, you may already be KoS with them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drzero</div><div class="date">11-29-1999, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Dark Elf, this was one of the best places to hunt. With a SK, Necro and Troll Warrior and myself, we took up inside the Dark Elf Merchant encampment and had more than enough to do. We sold to the vendors not 5 feet away, while a lot of wandering creatures happened by for us to kill (sometimes too many). If there was ever a break in the carnage, the warrior would just go out and pull something in. BE CAREFUL that you don't have a vendor targeted when you attack or cast, and somemtimes the madmen sit outside the tents and lob fireballs in at you (INCOMMING!).<br />
<br />
If you get bored there, go hunt one of the two (or three) derv camps. This zone is underhunted to the extreme, so plenty of fun can be had.<br />
<br />
Oh, and watch out for Terrorantula!!!!<br />
