<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siloob</div><div class="date">03-15-2000, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Around 19 I tried Unrest, found bad groups and bad trains so I said forget that.<br />
<br />
I tried out highpass, getting in those groups at 19 and 20 is great. Very good EXP and good loot Ringmail and Bronze weapons. I didn't get much of that since I don't loot often. (too busy looking at my spellbook) <br />
<br />
Later into 20 I went to East Karana and grouped with a Ranger and a Wizard, there we killed Broon the Cyclops. Great EXP but bad on the loot. Broon spawns in the canyon next to the Highpass/East Karana passage.<br />
<br />
Just at 21, I started in High Keep. This place is fun but can get dangerous. Killing Goblin lookouts and Guards in the basement. Very fun and always busy with heals. Sometimes it can be hard to get a group, we had a list tonight that had 10 people on it. But I got half of 21 in about 3 hours. I am going to stay there well into about 25, maybe. At 25 I might move back to Unrest and check that out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
