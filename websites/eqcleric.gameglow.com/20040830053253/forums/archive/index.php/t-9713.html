What the hell is wrong with you? Goddamn, if there is anything a class specific site should have is details on what their class can do. Get your act together you slackers.</div></div><hr />

Hello?<br />
<br />
Are we clueless here?<br />
<br />
Did you even bother to search the site before you started flaming?<br />
<br />
The spell list is located under the Misc. Topics section on the main menu.<br />
<br />
I would say the slacker here is you since you dont seem to take the time to search a site before just starting to whine and complain.<br />
<br />
Just because its not located straight ahead of your eyes doesnt mean it aint there.<br />
<br />
Here's the link for your convenience so that you god forbid dont have to click links to get somewhere:<br />

No offense to the non-kewl d00d 14 year olds out there.<br />

I think this sounds more like the thirtysomething childless unmarried yuppie with everything it wants because mommy and daddy were rich and left it all to me when I accidently shot them for abusing when I was a child by not buying me a cabbage patch doll for my best friend's birthday  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is unfair of me to automatically blame a teenager for acting immature... Sooo many adults are way too childish much too often.<br />
<br />
Thank you for pointing that out.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
