once you reach 5 get all yer new spells..<br />
then go to the windmills. There should be plenty to kill there from cleaner rats to kobold scouts. Want to watch out though, some <br />
pretty hard stuff there too.(Skele's puma's, plague rats, ect..) this should take you up to at least 7.. hopefully 8. Then you get meditate... then head over to the mino caves.. but don't hunt mino's go past them to the giant cogs where there 4 or five skeleton spawns, far enough away from each other that you can pull 1 at a time. good exp  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif your undead spell comes in handy  here  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
thats for soloing.. if you wanna group, i think its best in Crushbone near the wood elf city if you are on this part of the world  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

So you have to go to the far end of the windmill area where the plauge rats, pumas, and big skeletons spawn. Makes it a bit harder to get XP there, not impossible, just harder.  I found it better to run to Greater Feydark hunt Orcs.<br />

A mixed area is not a good area.  No matter how good you think it is when you have a steady supply of mobs at the right level, if you get killed regularly by the stray beastie that is five levels higher than you, it just makes things hard and slows down your ability to advance.</div></div><hr />

There's no fighting over spawns like there is in the Gfay newbie areas. And orc hill is just a pain.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />
