<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">11-12-1999, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found this out the hard way last night in guk. Names and places not included.<br />
<br />
My group went in to get a certain item off of a certain spawn in Upper guk. there was a level 50 nuker there. he refused to &quot;give way&quot; as the verant policy say they should. He would not even alternate spawns even though he had gotten what he was looking for.<br />
<br />
My group all /petitioned and we got a responses from the GMs that were online. I was told by them that the &quot;give way&quot; play nice policy was announced, but has not been implemented. They would investigate the matter.<br />
<br />
so what happened? nothing. even though we specifically asked if we could have the next spawn and were told &quot;no&quot;. <br />
<br />
so my group, with three people in it that needed the item, all sat around cleaning up the other spawns while this level 50 nuker farmed the spawn that we were waiting for so that he could (and he said this aloud too) twink his other character.<br />
<br />
Well, I now have a new feeling about KSers and Verant and their policies. This was such a blantant case that specifically violated their new &quot;rule&quot; and they did nothing about it. Should this become common knowledge to all the KSers out there who are actually intimidated by the new nonexistant rule, then we are back to square one again.<br />
<br />
Heh. Enough whining for me.<br />

When the &quot;gods&quot; don't answer the call make life a little harder on them =). Yours, E<br />
PS don't give me any of that &quot;sinking to their lvl&quot; crap either. A lvl 50 nuking in UG? Tha is BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pantheus</div><div class="date">11-14-1999, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's absolutely right. When a guide informed me after a petition that KS'n was not illegal unless they followed you to another zone to do it, I informed them that I would handle it myself. If there's no policy on KS'n, then there damn sure better not be one against defending yourself against it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wicked</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, there is no yield rule in effect so you can't blame Verant policies.  Secondly, who cares ?<br />
<br />
You weren't there first so what gives you the right to barge in on the guy and demand the spot?<br />
<br />
If he said he'd share, fine.  If not you move on.  If you can't accept that, your going to have a hell of a time playing this game.<br />
<br />
It seems to me you just want to use the so called &quot;yield&quot; rule to take over a spawn point at your convienience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zalana</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I learned that months ago. I petitioned about people farming items and got the same reply &quot;The issues of &quot;give way&quot;, KS, and farming are currently not illegal in game play. I am truely sorry but there is nothing I can do to help you.&quot;(most likely a social) <br />
<br />
It sucks....but what can ya do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ming</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You came upon this person and demanded they move? I would have stayed there until they banned me just to spite you. I'm totally against the &quot;yield&quot; policy, because it caters to tactless idiots with no social skills who can't interact in the first place. I can't wait for some ass to come along and say, &quot;ok, move out..we're here to get some xp&quot; while I'm camping say, the dark giant skellie for a new quest item. A quest item I would never have had the opportunity to camp, due to its lack of implementation at the time I was a lowby. <br />
<br />
Remember kids...Less Big Brother = more freedom. Most folk are basically decent if you treat them well, and if not...karma will get them. Even 50's need friends. If you argue that the &quot;bad&quot; 50's have friends..maybe you need to ask yourself why. Maybe you're just being a tad jealous/impatient, and need to reevaluate your position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twigg Bramblefoot</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely agree that the yield rule is complete garbage.<br />
<br />
Case in point: I was trying to get 24 in Highpass and was taking the spawns that conned blue to me and was competing with a group of individuals all lower than myself(this was before the group dmg rule which I think is a very good anti-ksing tool). I was sitting there gettting harrased by one of their crew and told that if I don't leave that they'll report me.  <br />
<br />
Now these spawns were blue to me and I had all the right in the world to be there. Nonetheless I petitioned a GM and found out that this rule was not implemented so essentially I spit in the face of that rogue scum and went on killing the blues while remaining fair and leaving the green ones to that group which were blue to them.<br />
<br />
Now this type of garbage is the reason why any rule that Verant figures they might implement can be completely abused and used as a scare tactic for groups to those who have as much right to be in that same zone as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanlee</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sounds like this farmer was being a dork. But I can't really blame him. He was there first, cleared and held the area, and should have some claim even if he is level 50 as long as he isn't hurting or harrassing anyone. That's not kill stealing. If you were there first and a level 50 came up and started killing something you were already camping, that would be different. <br />
<br />
It stinks, but it's part of the game. The better players will move on once they get what they need, but when you meet Farmer Dork all you can do is hope he gets a bad pull and ends up having to run. <br />
<br />
The only real drawback in my mind is that these are the people that ruin great items like rubicite and manastones. Sooner or later, the badly farmed stuff will attract Verant's attention and get removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kirasha Alcedonia</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When Verant announced their &quot;Play Nice&quot; policies, they said they weren't in place yet and were just being announced to invite discussion.<br />
<br />
Of course, it would be easy to mistake Verant's announcement of the policy as Verant putting the policy in place. I think their idea was to get the rules into people's minds so no one would be surprised and collect reactions to the policies.<br />
<br />
As this thread indicates, the &quot;Yield&quot; rule is both embraced and dispised by different people. There is some validity to the rule and yet it is also has serious flaws.<br />
<br />
While finding an &quot;item farmer&quot; camping the item you want is frustrating, its not against the rules. <br />
<br />
At least not yet.<br />

Not worth it, there's too many jerks out there to bother with it, wait two days for the item, its not that big of a deal.  Secondly, i was killing brownie outcasts the other day (to twink my other char, won't deny it) and someone came in and tried to pull the *you don't get exp, you have to leave* stuff with me, so i just invited a level 30 ranger into my group, and when the Guide showed up, he said since the ranger with me was getting exp, there's no reason i'd have to leave.  If these people had been polite, and asked me either to help them, or to share the spawns, i would have been glad to, but its the ones that come in and try to kick you out that are the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">11-27-1999, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's face it... farming isn't really a problem until you get to the &quot;good&quot; mobs -- those that are 35th and higher (lower guk, anyone?)...<br />
<br />
Was sharing spectre spawns with a level 49 wizard (my group of 35's).  He let us have all the ones that were blue to us, since they were green to him.  Those that were even/yellow to us, he wanted since they were blue to him.<br />
<br />
OK... so if at 49 the 35th level mobs still give you experience, is any sort of &quot;play nice&quot; rule going to make a bit of difference?  All the level 50 has to do is say they are blue to him, and the guides won't have any recourse.  So guess us 35th level folks are just SOL as long as the 50th folks want to keep farming the good items.<br />
<br />
Wake up, Verant -- make all the high level stuff no drop, and you'll stop a lot of the farming (of course, that would upset the level 50 folks wouldn't it -- can't offend your target market)!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkith</div><div class="date">11-27-1999, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know I'm gonna tick off alot of people by saying this....but..<br />
<br />
Alot of higher level people do this..whether it is to give to a twink character or to sell the items at auction or on Ebay..I was in Lguk last night and every once in awhile an ooc would pop up..<br />
<br />
&quot;Whats being camped in here?&quot;<br />
<br />
A level 50 druid was camping 3 areas...by HIMSELF....EXE SAV and one other (not all that familiar with the areas as I am just getting into into it)<br />
<br />
Now...my question is...what for?<br />
<br />
Lvl 50 druid...probably has all the nice items he needs in the game already...and THEN some.  I know this person has been lvl 49+ since I was 20ish (ran into him camping the ghost in Unrest)..and I am now 37.<br />
<br />
He is either selling the items in various ways, or twinking friends/his own characters.<br />
<br />
So...the answer to this seems very simple to me...but it goes on a touchy subject.<br />
<br />
Twinking.<br />
<br />
Here's the scenario...High level whatever obtains an Exe hood.  Says to himself 'Self, Let's sell this hood to some lower level character'.<br />
Then proceeds to AUCTION, tell people..whatever...give it to his low level monk, or put a notice up on Ebay for a bit of cash.<br />
<br />
Now..If there were LEVEL LIMITS applied to items.  Lets see.<br />
When trying to Equip this item players underl lvl 30 get the message 'You do not understand how to properly wear/weild/utilize this item'<br />
<br />
What will this do:<br />
<br />
First.  Stop those annoying 8th level casters announcing 'BUYING SHINY METALLIC ROBE, OBSERVERS STAFF AND OTHER GOOD CASTER STUFF.<br />
<br />
Second.  Though it won't STOP twinking (though it would reduce it a hell of a lot), there would NOT be all those teen chars running around in equipment that a lvl 40 would die for.  Lets face it...why give your lower level char TONS of cash and equipement..if they can't use it till they level the usual way.<br />
<br />
Third.  People will be ALOT less inclined to buy items offa Ebay.  Verant has stated they are against this, and it actually goes against the license agreement of the game.  So you have some money to spare in your RL, and you want a Runed Falchion.  Well I'll just buy one on Ebay...Hmmm Can't use it. Guess I have to WAIT, and maybe..I'll be high enough on my own to get it myself (or in a group), and NOT be buying things from Ebay.<br />
<br />
Fourth.  Why would a nice level 50ish farm items now?  You can't give them to low level chars..useless...Can't sell them to people on Ebay (unless they are high enough level, and, in that case, much more likely to have obtained it on their own)..And if not usable by their class its pretty useless.<br />
<br />
maybe its me...but it offends my sensibilities to see EQ items being marketed in RL, and twinking to low level chars.  I try VERY hard in the game..and while I COULD be selling and farming items...this just denies those items to those people in the game that COULD use them.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see a nice item go to a group that fought its way down into a dungeon, killed a creature and the came back out.  Rather than go to a bored lvl 50, that only wants to earn some cash from the game or make his wee warrior kick newbie tail.<br />
<br />
Kinda long.<br />
<br />
But its how I feel.<br />

Some items in the game already have level limits on them, so I don't see it as not being a major jump to include more items with level limits as well.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing items that can not even be picked up by other classes as well.<br />
<br />
Although a pain, I think the results from these suggestions would be fairly positive. No more level X's farming, very little twinking of items etc.<br />
<br />
BTW has the Skull of Jhen'tra and RTS always been LORE ITEM ? (ie only 1 allowed on person)<br />

That is the best, most sensible idea for this game that I have come across.  It would do much to fix the few things that are &quot;wrong&quot; with this game.  Does this mean that Verant will never implement it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkith</div><div class="date">11-29-1999, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope.<br />
<br />
Probably won't be implemented.<br />
<br />
That's just me talking very pessimistic about the game.<br />
<br />
I'm not frustrated by the game.  I seem to do well.  I have good groups and good friends to group with.  And I usually come out ahead of the game rather than behind when I log in (Got a Night Shade Wreath last night)<br />
<br />
I don't think that Minimum Levels will be assigned to items, though I too think that this would solve ALOT of problems that exist currently with the game.  For a few reasons.<br />
<br />
a) Farming and Item Acquisition Keep those High level power people playing.  They are paying customers too, and as long as the average player doesn't yell too much...the fanatics will keep playing.<br />
<br />
b) Imagine the outcry from people.  Those that twink would cry foul (though by far the vast majority of twinkers are those that give their sub chars bronze and such..and not necessarily VERY high level items)..and to lower level good items (RTS, Bronze, BI Armor, BF Hammer, Etc.) it would be hard to assign a 'LOWER LEVEL' to these...as a lower level char with a good head could get a few of these things.<br />
<br />
c) Verant, from what I have seen, rarely take a good idea from the masses.  You are in their world now.<br />
<br />
Now I'm a Computer Engineer.  More to the point, I design and implement newer and better ways to store data and access it through various ways for large companies.  SO, adding a 'column' 'INT' value to indicate minimum lvl of usage to the entire list of items in the game would be somewhat trivial for the scope of change and the staff committed to design and maintenance of the current product.  Added to this that there is already a FUNCTION that checks all stats of an item before being worn/placed in inventory.  Simply add one more.<br />
<br />
Its an easy change from that standpoint, and has the potential to clear up alot of bad points about the game that I don't like now.  But like I said.  I'm pretty pessimistic about Verant taking a suggestion and making all the fanatics cry foul.<br />
