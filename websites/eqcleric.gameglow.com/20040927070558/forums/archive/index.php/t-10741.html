<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panteroo</div><div class="date">04-25-2001, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was in a serious funk after i dinged 47... too much was greening out in CoM, Happ is perma-camped on Fennin Ro, DL just plain sucks, KC = Crushbone on steriods, BW was feast or famine, LGuk reminded me of Kansas with all the farmers, Sol-B *echo* *echo*...<br />
<br />
I finally, on the advice of a guildmate, grabbed a 48warrior and a 48mage and went to Velks Lab, located in GD.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the zone in ramp there is a large room with multiple spiders and statues (which look like gargoyles). The gargoyles were green but all the spiders where blue. We hunted there from 11:30pm MST to 2:30am MST and I got 3 yellow bubs of experience. Amazing experience at 47 and 48 (finally dinged 48 woohoo!).<br />
<br />
Some things to know:<br />
1) The spiders will invis themselves so you need to be able to see invis.<br />
2) One spider type is a rogue class and will backstab you for 200+<br />
3) Crystal Devourer's have a NASTY poison DoT that i couldn't get rid of when i cast 5 Counteract Poisons<br />
4) Mobs will occasionally drop real and fake quest gems. In the 3 hours we were there we got 4 real and 3 fake quest gems.<br />
5) The mobs are supposed to be on a random drop table and their are many nice items to be had in there... we didn't see anything (item wise) drop from the loot table so i don't know if the mobs near the zone are on the random table or not.<br />
6) respawns seem to be on a good 9-12 minute timer as we always had at least 1 mob to pull when we were ready. There were approximately 7-9 spawns in that first room. (not 100% sure on number of spawns).<br />
<br />
You *could* possibly solo here, but i would highly recommend a small 2-3 person group... Tank, Cleric, Pet-caster with see-invis worked VERY well for us.<br />
<br />
just another option for the masses  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
