           meltdown. <br />
           I ask that ye both each have selected ye honor guard- they are dah only ones allowed to wield a weapon.<br />
           Ye can if ye wish write vows to each other, I will signal ye when it's time fer ye to speak.<br />
           I will gladly talk a bit bout the Bindings of love n such, words of Tunare are not unknown to me, as I often hear<br />
           tehm wood elf wenches scream them in me ears.//// HAR HAR<br />
<br />
           Ahh any how, dah wedding goes like dis.<br />
<br />
           &gt; ME&lt;<br />
           HG YOU BRIDE HG<br />
<br />
<br />
           GUESTS-yers GUESTS hers<br />
<br />
<br />
           Dats seating n such. If ye wish to have Dancing Ogres or bards fer entertainment that's up to ye.<br />
           Ye both Dress in yer best of course.<br />
           I Welcome the gathered<br />
           I introduce each of ye and name yer titles if ye have em( we will be grouped- YOU Me Bride HG) and yer bride.<br />
           I offer a perfuntuary open challenge that is symbolic in nature that yer HG steps forward to stand in yer place.<br />
           Then Ye Face me. <br />
           Kneel - I bless the group (AOE HEAL for perty lights)<br />
           Rise- then I tell a bit about the gods coming to Norrath and the duties of the elder races.<br />
           Then I Test resolution (SPELL) and Guard ye from Outside evil (AoF or Guard) And Then Protect ye from Fire<br />
           ICE and POISON N DISEASE. SO ye may have fruitful lives free from ills. <br />
           Then I bless the crowd.<br />
           And then I have ye two face each other....And allow a moment (Beer break...well in dwarven ceremonies there<br />
           are at least 12 beer breaks and one bathroom break)<br />
           I ask in grouptell that ye each are ready (Macros help as do emotes here- practice in private)<br />
           Ye Kneel or not to her and speak yer vows<br />
           She does same<br />
           HG presents the rings to each <br />
           Ye exchange rings and put them on<br />
           I BIND YE BOTH to the spot. Or if yer casters ye can do yerselves if out doors.<br />
           Then ye face the crowd- I present the new couple and shout it to zone (at that time a GM or senior guide<br />
           changes yer names) <br />
           Then ye kiss each other<br />
<br />
           THEN WE PARTY!!!<br />
<br />

           Dats me plan, but tis subject to me whims and changes...<br />
