<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juul</div><div class="date">03-18-2000, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm in the plane of fear, fighting for my life (and the lives of several others)... We had just pulled the temple while clearing up to Cazic.. and I get a tell.<br />
A_Cleric_00 tells you, 'can you tell me exactly how you got the aegis of life?  how did you know when your faction was high enough?  what quests did you do?  did you use wolf form?'<br />
You tell A_Cleric_00, 'kinda busy at the moment, go check a cleric web site.'<br />
A_Cleric_00 tells you, '$&amp;*((@%&amp;*(@&amp;%%$_!%$&amp;_  All I did was ask a question, you don't have to be so rude about it!'<br />
<br />
I replied nothing to this.. biting back comments such as &quot;If I had wanted to be rude, I would have ignored you&quot; and &quot;Considering I detailed my quest for the Aegis on at LEAST 3 message boards, and have read postings by another dozen people and how they got it, maybe you could consider looking there instead of trying to take up the gametime that I'm paying for?&quot;.<br />
<br />
At any rate, it did nothing to endear me to the person in question.  The tell was completely random - because I was a un-anon level 50 cleric.  Considering the fact that &lt;fearplane&gt; was listed as my current zone, you would think MAYBE he had a clue that I was busy?<br />
<br />
So now there is a cleric out there somewhere who hates me.  Nevermind the fact that I stop to res bodies that I run past.  Nevermind that I have been known to spend hours in Oasis just running around casting resolution - with a &quot;thank you&quot; rate of about 5% on a good day.  None of the good matters - just the fact that I was too busy trying to keep the people I was with alive to provide spoiler information.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yes, I do have '/r You can find the information on EQ'Lizer' macro'd as of today.<br />

     Guess I am rude then, I would not have even answered if I was fighting it iut in POF. Some things take priority (lives of tose I am resposible for). Maybe if there was a break in the fighting I would have answered. Just a thought.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
