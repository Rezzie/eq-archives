<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemean</div><div class="date">06-21-2000, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone got any good spots for mid 30s (Im 36 right now) soloing in Kunark?  I play in the wee small hours US time, so often I just cannot get a group due to there only being 5 people in a zone - so I have to solo a lot, and I'm sick of Lower Guk.<br />
<br />
Ideally I'm looking at undead spots - since I'm finding Wrath is beginning to not cut it any more for damage (I'm getting oom and blue mobs still have about 25% hit points).<br />
<br />
Any ideas?  I really want to avoid LGuk/Spectre in Ferrott, coz dammit, I paid for this expansion pack, and I want to use it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

The gob casters are nasty and should be avoided, You should be able to solo most of the badgers forgot thier name.Gaints and brutes are ok too the gaints have a lot of hp but you can kill them. <br />
 My other hunting ground is Dalnir in the Warsilk woods. It is a little hard to find but worth the look. The first floor will yake you safely through 36. Just pull to the zone room, most mobs will be exp green to blue. One of the nice drops there is the Sap of Piety damage 13 1HB. There is a high lvl necklace at the bottom so you can find a few 50+ chacters there most of the time camping it. Makes getting a res possible  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />
 You should also be able to find a partener pretty easy even during the off hours. That is in both locations. If you hunt Frontier be careful about medding there are a LOT of walkers and you want have much time to set before something comes by to fight. Best bet there is bind near a zone line and gate back to med, I know this doesn't sound good but getting jumped while medding hurts more. If you can get a range you are golden. <br />
Good Luck <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braddley</div><div class="date">07-24-2000, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, about a week ago, I was hunting solo with another 35th lvl cleric (dwarf as well!  WOO HOO!) and we were solo'ing the spiders in FV.  All were blue to us and fairly easilly killed.  Root, Wrath, Wrath, Root, Wrath.  Loot, Med.  (Rinse and Repeat).<br />
<br />
Only drawback is that some of them cast some nasty spells and some like to resist alot.  Also, root is competeley more random than ever before on them.  Sometimes, the entire fight.  Othertimes, Root, Unrooted.  (Grumbles)  Root again.  Unrooted.  (Curses).  Root.  Sticks.  Nuke the piss outta it.  hehe  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
