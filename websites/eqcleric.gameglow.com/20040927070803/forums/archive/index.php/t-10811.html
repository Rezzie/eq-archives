<br />
A nice little aspect of Xygoz' silence is that it is line of sight. The first few times we fought him we took advantage of that in selecting the pull location.<br />
<br />
Now we just pull all four statics to one spot and do not worry about sightlines.<br />
<br />
I rely on fast casting heals against Xygoz, he does not hit very hard so you do not have to do much healing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">03-18-2001, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This isn't really a tactic since I don't get into that stuff, but to ensure I go oom (ie, heal all that I can):<br />
<br />
- I reduce the delay between me starting to cast a spell and the server realizing I'm starting to cast a spell.  Every possible spam is filtered, settings all the way down, /reverb off, /dynamiclight off, F9 during the fight to top view, etc.  The instant I start a spell I want to know if I'm silenced.  You can keep hitting the spell over and over and between Xygoz's ae there's a window where the silence wears off and the next ae begins.<br />
- Once a spell starts, getting hit by silence again won't stop it.  This means if I'm in the tank group I'll use CH heavily unless a tank is under a bubble of life.  If I'm in a caster group I'll use Word of Healing. (the 49 one - you pay extra mana for effects you don't need in this fight with word of vigor and restoration)  The casting time of a spell is irrelevant since it will be a while before you can cast again if you fail to resist.<br />
- In a tank group, when Xygoz is in view but not in ae range yet, I cast celestial heal (can't wait for 49 and CE) on the one most likely to need heals in the group.  It will feed the tank some hp's at the start of the fight while I'm busy mashing the CH button and watching everyone's hp's to see who my healing priorities are.<br />
- If nobody in my group is near death, the instant I see a resist message I rapidly /assist Xygoz a couple times.  If I see someone near death then I toss a fast DL and go back to starting a CH/WoH on my group.  Those resist messages are precious, worth squeezing out every bit of healing you can when blessed by them.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this seems elementary to veterans. I'm a VP newbie and it took a while for me to learn how to heal in this fight.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">03-19-2001, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually go into the Xygoz fight with around a 230ish MR.  I average about 50% resists.  So in the 50% I resist, I have DL as my friend.  One time I did get off a group CH and I shortly after was made into a cleric sandwich (this was right after the hate nerf).  But usually I chain cast DL seems to work best for me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">03-19-2001, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the 2 or 3 times I've been in and killed Xygoz my MR was in the 190-210ish range and I would estimate that I resisted atleast 50% of his silence spells.  On 1 messed up pull we managed to kill him with an extra guardian wurm and drake thing.  For casters in this fight MR is key.  Also, the silence doesn't last a super long time, so even if you do get silenced, it should wear off and then hopefully you can resist the next one and/or get a spell off between getting silenced again.  Like others have mentioned, I try and use fast cast heals like DL or CE.  Also, when I am silenced, I get up there and start meleeing him (might as well do something useful assuming my mana is ok).<br />
