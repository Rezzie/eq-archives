WONDERFUL exp...but I generally died every few hours.. the problem isn't trains [blues and greens usually], it's figuring out when to zone...because some of the time the courtyard can be packed with alligators and lizards...and yet the people CAN kill them all, and reap exp as well.. however, by the time you know you can't make it, the area is usually too packed TO make it to an exit -_-; ]<br />
Hope that this helps someone later on =)</div></div><hr />
