<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paoldara</div><div class="date">12-16-2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crystal Dawn is a european raiding guild on the Tholuxe Paells server, currently in the Plane of Time. <br />
<br />
Tholuxe Paells is a 3 year old server, not very populated : only 2 guilds are raiding the Plane of Time, including Crystal Dawn. The closest guild to enter the zone has not defeated Coirnav and the Rathe Council yet. <br />
<br />
Also, there is only one other European raiding guild on the server, which has not entered the Elemental Planes yet and which gives Crystal Dawn a certain advantage in terms of time zone when we raid other zones than the Plane of Time. <br />
<br />
We are looking for new clerics who are able to play a lot, with a good and nice team of players.<br />
<br />
We require level 65 and a minimum of 80 AA points total (including SCM3, MGB, Divine Arbitration 3, Radiant Cure 1) and your epic.<br />
<br />
The more flags you have the better it is, being elemental plane flaged or even time flaged is a big plus. But we will also consider good players if they miss flags as we reflag our applicants when needed. <br />
<br />
We raid 6 days a week from 7:30 PM CET to 11:30PM CET (1:30 PM to 5:30 PM EST) <br />
You shall not think of applying to us if you can't at least raid 4 evenings a week at those times. <br />
<br />
For more informations and to post your application online, please check www.crystaldawn.info and this post in particular : http://www.crystaldawn.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6021<br />
<br />
Feel free also to send me a tell in game (;tell tholuxe.Paoldara … across server for Tholuxe Paells) if you have any question, or to our (gnomish ;)  ) guild leader Nomics if you don’t find me online. You can also send me an email at paoldara@crystaldawn.info if you have any additional question.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward your application and raiding with you !<br />
<br />
