<br />
Brief setup required:<br />
<br />
I'm exp grinding in Velks cause I can usually get a group and the exp is consistent (albeit slow at 59). This zone has become solo central for any 60 monk, SK, pally, mage, necro, warrior, you name it. If they can solo, they can solo in a level 45-60 dungeon!<br />
<br />
My rant on soloing will stay out of this, but when these guys die while soloing and ask for a rez I really get torn on this. My general rule is (esp since I have my clicker now) I'll rez anyone, esp if they drag the corpse to me while I'm working with my group.<br />
<br />
My experience in this dungeon is challenging this. Why should I rez a player so he can continue to take spawns from my group?<br />
<br />
If nothing else should I at least make him feel the pain of it and charge him, say, 100p?<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on this would be most appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, let me temper this by saying that I dual box all the time with my monk, esp when I can't find a group. But if my group fills, I usually will drop the monk out. If a spot opens and we can't find anyone, I'll ask if anyone minds if we add him in but its a secondary concern. He does make a contribution after all.<br />
<br />
I won't say the tanks name here but needless to say he's got a serious petition in for my no rez list, which is admittedly extemely short.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But slowly and surely I am starting to deny requests for buffs when people are soloing.  Buffing people will help them solo in a) being able to solo in the first place for some people or b) able to solo more efficiently thereby taking more mobs away from my group.<br />
<br />
Especially when I get a L30-something monk who zones in to velks for the sole purpose of finding a 60 cleric with group aegolism and 2000 extra free mana to cast on him (and him alone--no group).  &quot;I'll give you 50pp&quot; he says.  I won't post my reply to him :)<br />
<br />
Now when someone asks for a rez I tell them &quot;why don't you get the cleric in your group to cast a buff on you?&quot; and/or &quot;I'm sure there are plenty of clerics LFG that would love to buff you...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well, if some stranger asked to take one of my 'bots out of my XP group (when I was actively letting them farm XP instead of just powering my other char(s)) I'd laugh and say no.  If they persisted I'd use /ignore.  I only give up a 'bot slot to guildies/friends.  Since damned near all my friends are guildies (guess I don't have many friends) it's pretty much just guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monax</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess its just a matter of perspective. I don't know if he owned the group or not. I would agree with you Rayne if I had created the XP group, let some folks in to help farm XP and was asked to drop my monk out so another monk could get XP, I'd prolly say no as well.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that he was not the leader/founder of the group and was clearly not hooked up with guildies/friends. I guess its just hooked in as part of my frustration with trying to get decent XP in places where I'm competing with solo acts and now I have dual boxing players to worry about as well.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, most of this comes from frustration of trying to finish 59. Once I do, Velks will be a distant memory unless my guild tries to do Lord Bob or Velketor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd drop my bot for a guildy, but not for a stranger unless I was tired of the 2 man thing.<br />
<br />
As far as buffing/rezzing  the soloers goes, I generally do it while muttering stuff under my breathe at the monitor. If I do it after sitting at the zoneline waiting for a group for any extended period of time it is usually followed by a /gu night all.<br />
<br />
It just takes my desire to play away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd really think about it as common courtesy to drop a dual'ed character to let someone else in the group (except if you're leading a &quot;me myself and I&quot; type groupe, in which case you wouldn't have to invite anyone in the first place... there are many excellent single player games around though, you might want to try these instead of playing alone in a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ORPG), but apparently everyone else wouldn't. <br />
<br />
I'd rather group with 5 people who can give their full attention to the group, than with people who can only give it 2 halves because they're dual boxing.<br />

Oh well, its a business.. what do you expect :)<br />
<br />
I agree with what Mildaene said.. except I don't think the problem is that one might not be able to concentrate with their two boxes... just that I don't think its fair for one person to get double the experience because he has two characters, and have another person sit on the zone line and get no exp. <br />
<br />
After an experience I had, I will not buff other people in exp groups. And thanks to the fact I don't have an epic, I can get away with not rezzing either :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arynia</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's worse I think than when they beg for a rez...is when the soloer comes up to you with a shiver of life left, asks for a heal, then asks if you could possibly buff him.  Now, you won't let a cleric into your group but you will run to them when your life is low and you're too impatient to sit and heal up.  Not to mention, if you do it once, they will keep coming back to you for heals and buffs.  /sigh   If only we could solo like that!! LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bakamon</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long time reader, first time poster.  I just couldn't pass this up....<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight, I've very confused.  You zone in to Velks, do a Cleric LFG, and no one will &quot;let&quot; you in a group?  No one will invite you?  All the mobs are occupied with solo'ers?  Jebbus HP Christ! Go somewhere else!  Sitting at the zonein crying and feeling sorry gets you Zero exp.  Zero loot.   Zero sympathy!  Go to Luclin and look around a bit!  I get invites daily from complete strangers looking for a cleric in CT and Sebilis and SkyFire.  There's all kind of places for a high level cleric to get exp, loot and friends.<br />
<br />
Nobody Deserves a rez, Nobody!  A solo'er &quot;/tell rez plz&quot;, you agree to do it or not; its Completely Up to You.  Its also up to you to charge him 100pp, or 2 stacks of silk, or a stack of velium pieces or whatever.  Its also up to you to heal and buff or not!  I have never seen a rule anywhere that a cleric HAD to rez anybody, anytime, anywhere.  Its usually in a clerics best interest to not refuse, and to follow the good cleric doctrine of providing a rez when possible, but to substitue someone elses enjoyment or time in the game for Your enjoyment and time is Never required and should not be expected.<br />
<br />
..and the last one.  Double boxing (or triple boxing or quadboxing).  People with two accounts,  Pay for two accounts and have absolutely the same rights to game assets as you do.  I have 4 accounts and on occasion play 3 of them.   In a stable spawn situation, where a tank/puller can bring mobs to a controlled place, 3boxing is not only good, but I love it and have a great time.  I've 2boxed a cleric/wizard in many groups in KC, Seb, Kael and such with Never a complaint.  I've never been asked to drop a char to let someone in.  I never even thought about it till I read this post.  If you could explain to me, Mildaene, why I should give up a position to let you in, I'd be very interested in your argument.  And Quotison, how do you figure I get twice the exp since I'm playing two characters.  Each of my characters Earns his part of the exp pool unless as you stated, one char sits under a tree and does absolutely nothing.  If I buy two tickets to a stadium event so I can have extra space to sit, should I give one up to you just because you Want it?  Dont think so.<br />
<br />
..and one last thing.  Your current group should be your Main and Only concern.  Replying to a rez request with &quot;...sorry, main healer in a full group..&quot; should end it right there.   I hate when my group healer rezs a couple of drag ups and we have to sit and wait for him to recover mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no arguing. If you can't understand why 2 boxing in a group while someone is lfg at the zone isn't right, then no amount of arguments will ever convince you that the whole world doesn't revolve around you. Nobody should even have to ask you to let the other person (as opposed to account) in and have their share of fun too, YOU should be the one to realize your selfishness.<br />
<br />
Each of my characters Earns his part of the exp pool unless as you stated, one char sits under a tree and does absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Your two characters still can't beat two different persons playing them, because you have to divide your attention (and hands) between the two of them. Yet they gain as much xp as anyone else who's giving 100% attention to one character. In a sense, you're getting twice as much xp as any other person (player, not character) in the group, although you're still only giving the game as much attention as they do. <br />
<br />
The abilities of your chars add up in a way though (bring your cleric and you can heal where you couldn't before,...), so I'll admit this point is debatable.<br />
<br />
If I buy two tickets to a stadium event so I can have extra space to sit, should I give one up to you just because you Want it?  Dont think so.<br />
<br />
See above. To gain yourself some comfort (and no more enjoyement, you'll still see the same match whether you bought 1 or 2134 seats), you deprive someone else (who would have been able to buy that seat, had you not rented it &quot;for extra space to sit&quot;) of the very same match you're enjoying. <br />
<br />
People really have to understand the concept of &quot;greater good&quot; (as opposed to &quot;good for me, @*%# you!&quot;) some day, and start giving some consideration to others. That would make the world a better place.<br />
<br />
Oh well, guess I can dream on...<br />

<br />
Exp was so fast and furiuos, life was GREAT till everyone on Tarew Marr decided to go there.  Still....it wasn't that bad.<br />
<br />
Later on, as Luclin came out, folks ended up being far better equipped than every before, then you started really seeing a ton of single of duo setups which had the same, if not more, DPS than what we had as a 6 person group, a year before that. :(<br />
<br />
That's okay.  I guess I'm joining that crowd as well, as I recently moved my cleric to my 2nd account and am slowely building back up and leveling my former warrior main.<br />
<br />
Is a little slow, due to being in a guild like mine.  heh.  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vumra</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 3 box  regularly  60 war 60 Chanter 60 cleric.  I will drop the chanter in a heart beat IF i get another one from my guild.  If a chanter is in zone LFG LFG and i know them sure i'll drop mine for them.  But random NOOB_01 never!<br />
<br />
  I usually start the group with my 3  and end up with just the War and Cleric left.  So infact i 3 box ALOT, my guild benifits due to me always XPing and not caring what other 3 join me.  I've had a group with 3 Clerics a wiz chanter war, make for some fun pullin. :)<br />
<br />
   So yeah i'd personally say your out of line to EXPECT me to drop one of my chars for YOU.  Sounds prettty selfish to me, all your thinking about is YOU, not me who's paid for 3 chars, 3 computers, and the Connection to handle them all.  <br />
<br />
   Now don't get me wrong i will drop any of my 3 except the cleric for a group if it fills out.  Most of the time i never have to drop the War/Cleric.<br />
<br />
  Enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monax</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The original intent of my rant was to address the number of folks soloing in VL and then expecting me to rez/buff them. Having a clicker seems to make the problem worse because I'm less likely to deny a request because it doesn't cost me any mana. That's my problem, of course. I have no doubt that once I reach 60, the aego requests will get even more severe, in which case I'm likely to treat them like most folks do with C3, and charge them 100p per person, whether its group version or not. Because its very unlikely my guild would trip over a copy of aego or blessing of, I'm having to fork out roughly 12-14k in order to have these spells. Its only fair that I get a chance to recoop some of that money. Enchanters are just as warranted in doing that for the 30k they likely had to fork out for C3, if not more so.<br />
<br />
As for the dual/tri boxing, I would have never posted a rant here because its just my opinion and its obviously not shared. The only time I dual box is when I can't find a group which luckily is rare these days.<br />
<br />
The reason I was conflicted on the whole matter is that in all the RPG's I've played, I have always been a healer/cleric. I do so because I genuinely enjoy helping folks. In Velks it seems like I'm getting taken advantage of and thus the source of the rant.<br />
<br />
I think I'll just take it on a case by case basis but I do think that if I don't know you, there's a good chance a persons rez request will have them heading to the bank prior to getting clicked.<br />
<br />
/rant off</div></div><hr />

I have seen 2-boxed clerics heal better than main clerics, while still remaining completely attentive to their other character.  How many sessions of EQ they are running has very little bearing on skill, especially in an easy dungeon such as Velks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyrah</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that it's very frustrating when someone who chooses to solo expects strangers to provide buffs, rezzes, heals, etc to them. For me it's not so much that they'll steal my group's mobs, but that want the benefits of grouping with a cleric without sharing the xp. It's quite irritating to use mana on them, when it is needed for my own group. And much of the time these people just kind of expect without being thankful :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feadorn Lifegiv</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doc, a lot of people want free rezes... they even sorta expect it.  And when you have a clicker, its even more demanding.  But it seems a lot of people dont realize that we have wasted 4-8 weeks our our lives getting the rez stick.  I myself sat there for 7 weeks non stop.  Its these same people, that dont have a problem paying 100pp per C3 cast.<br />
<br />
If people want to solo...fine... either go without the buffs or pay for them is all i would ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">discordkitty</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing to think about is the fact that maybe, just maybe two of the people duoing together in any zone are friends that don't get to hang out alot and just want to spend some time together without other people / strangers sharing that time.<br />

Is that wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">piikaa</div><div class="date">08-20-2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever I'm looking for buffs, I usually ask if they (the chanter / druid / shammy / etc) want to trade what I'm looking for with any of my buffs.  This has gotten me many more possitive responses than just paying PP for them.  If I get a SoW, I'll cast Symbol of Pinzarn, Resolution, Shield of Words and maybe a few resists and strength.  Yes, they may not need it, but the person that just gave me one buff just got 3-7 buffs in return.  I have had PC's often say, hey - just a sec, here's some other neat ones for you...<br />

<br />
You owe people to not actively ruin their day.<br />
You do NOT owe them to help them when they have problems, but you should. It's nice to be nice. Ressing falls into this category. Buffing and downtime healing does not.<br />
<br />
As for buffing, downtime healing, letting people you don't need into your group... Do it if you feel like it. Your time is worth as much as theirs. No more, no less. And your time is YOURS. Talking about strangers here, of course. You should go out of your way to make things enjoyable for your friends. Certainly not to a doormat degree, but far beyond what you do for strangers.<br />
<br />
Giving up a slot so someone else can get xp instead of your char, well, that's the 4:th step on this scale. I apreciate it if my friends do it for me, but I sure as hell don't think that they mst, unless there is some very special situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ludashanus</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not posted for a long time myself. I think alot of this can be summed up in one word.<br />
<br />
Expectations.<br />
<br />
I like to roleplay my cleric, though I have never gone anon.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because the whole draw of EQ for me is the human factor. Those who have played with Luda know he will never run from battle. He will always have his focus on the group and his friends. He will always try to cheer up those who are depressed and speak out when he feels something wrong is happening.<br />
<br />
My friends send me a tell, ask me what's going on. I tell them I'm in a group. They say have fun. They usually don't begin by saying.... Hey I need a rez. Usually, I'll ask them what is going on and if the friend has helped me in the past (by going out of their way to help when I needed it), I'll politely leave the group at an appropriate time (not in the middle of a dungeon or raid) and help.<br />
<br />
One problem with EQ is that too many people believe their needs to be far above everyone's else. I have a thousand stories of whiners, beggars, those who would stab you in the back and those who would train you just because.<br />
<br />
These humans are crazy.<br />
<br />
I'm guilty of it too. We expect the EQ world to be respectful of our class and playstyle and get slighted after many hours of playing and take it personally. That's when I know I'm emersed in this world. Ack, where's my mace!<br />
<br />
So what is a headstrong cleric to do? I make it very clear that when I'm in a group, ressing is out of the question, no matter the price. The only exception is when I'm in a guild group and someone offers me 800pp, I have to ask the group. Usually they say yes to this extreme because I have helped them when they need to do something vital. I usually split it among the group, then get bonked over the head as five people give me the money back. When you're humble and helpful, people are in return.<br />
<br />
I love reading about the rants of clerics, not to bash other classes, or places to hunt, but because of the human factor. They are fun stories.<br />
<br />
Like the guild who refuses to help anyone because it is their roleplaying, but expect buffs and resses from me when they need it. I can roleplay too. Sorry, but you have to bend down, I can't hear you down here (then I bonk them with my mace....don't tell Brell). Or the warrior with decked out armor and weapons asking for buffs because he can't allow another to suck up experience points. Why does he do this, because he has been successful at it.<br />
<br />
I'm a cause of this too. When I'm alone and traveling I will buff people who need it, or throw a heal on someone. When I come across a corpse, I do a who all and see if they are online and need a rez. I NEVER charge for it, but I do take donations when someone bugs me.<br />
<br />
No one is going to play your way. People who have four accounts and can single-handedly, or four times, play all four and win, more power to them. I don't know many octopuses that can play EQ (maybe two).  I had a situation where a cleric and monk were in the same party, the cleric was the leader. During the fight the cleric only healed the monk, while he let the rest of his party die. Pretty pathetic, but a funny story. No wonder they were glad when I showed up.<br />
<br />
I play to have fun. I don't play to sit on my arse and wait for a mob to be pulled from Hate or some other plane, unless the druid is really, really convincing.<br />

Woodelves are silly creatures who can talk a bird down to a party of wolves (druids should get this joke...well not funny). (roleplaying. I mean no offense to woodelves).<br />

Now the trick of you is whether you actually read this whole message, or just took that one sentence personally and replied.<br />
<br />
Have fun. Remember that no one is going to play your way unless you tell them. I don't actually put anyone on ignore any more, I just pretend to, because I find it so funny.<br />

I know, I know, a cleric who takes pleasure in seeing other people make fools of themselves. I guess I do have a little bard in me....<br />

Lud.<br />
Cleric of 51 circles and awfully dizzy.<br />
Conveyor of worthless advice and an occassional duck joke, because he thinks he knows everything.<br />

He is a dwarf, mind you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abyssak</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There seems to be a lot of animosity built up over people asking for rezzes/buffs/heals/etc.  But, I fail to understand why....<br />
<br />
Soloers ask me for buffs all the time.  I always say 'no.'  If they want to pay for buffs or trade buffs, that's different, but I cannot stomach a begger.  <br />
<br />
Buffwanter: will u buff me plz?<br />
Me:  No, not right now, I won't.<br />
<br />
And that's usually it.  The only thing I'll always do is cure disease or poison.  And if I'm in a good mood, I'll then throw in a heal or a buff, but that's about it.<br />
<br />
If people were in such dire need of a clerics services, they'd have one in a group.  They don't *need* heals.  They can sit and wait for all that hp to regen.  (Kind of like the way I have to sit and wait for all that mana to regen if I'm soloing undead.)<br />
<br />
And not being able to stomach a begger doesn't only apply to others; it applies to me.  I *never* ask people to buff me or give me things.  People sometimes do these things anyway b/c they feel like it, they same way I'll heal/buff/or whatever if I feel like it.<br />
<br />
As for rezzes, I don't have that ability yet, but I can certainly envision how that's going to go.  If I'm not grouping, and someone is *extremely* polite about it or paying for it (or, of course, in my guild) I'll do it.  Otherwise, no dice.<br />

Doc, as a cleric its really up to you what you want to do for the solo'er asking for assistance. There really is no right or wrong, it is ultimately &quot;your choice&quot; as a person.<br />
<br />
Personally I will run through zones and heal/buff as I see fit &quot;just because&quot;, But I do not look kindly to those who expect/demand it of me. Although, my biggest kick is to buff the unsuspecting NOOB and watch them jump around with glee as they can't believe the number of hitpoints they have! /giggle.<br />
<br />
Your time in EQ is what you make of it. - But remember to try and have FUN!!  :D<br />
<br />
Now...as to playing double characters...if someone has 2 accounts and can play them both well - why not? If they can work 2 and get xps for 2 - thats great... remember the flipside too, they can also have both characters get killed, double the xp loss and spend twice as long getting rezzed. Risk/Reward. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
IMHO - I would rather group with 1 person playing 2 than 1 person playing 1 really BAD :p</div></div><hr />
