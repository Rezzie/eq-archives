<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thessalian</div><div class="date">09-14-2000, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't expect this will earn me many friends  since I've always been behind the average level of the posting population here, but I have to get this off my chest. And remember, this IS the rant board.<br />
<br />
Dear Vicar, Templars, and Grand High Viziers:<br />
<br />
Yes, I am a lowly 49 cleric. Yes, you look at me in-game and see that I don't have any purple armor, or that new green stuff, or a paw of Opalla. You can't quite place my guild tag because it's a kinda small, low-profile guild. <br />
<br />
However.<br />
<br />
Please do not assume this means you need to eagerly jump on every chance to tell me how to play a cleric. <br />
<br />
Please do not tell me when to use Complete Heal and when not to use it.<br />
<br />
Please do not tell me how my buffs are useless compared to yours. <br />
<br />
Please show some respect for the fact that I joined your group and immediately asked if you would prefer to nuke or heal, and how you want to split the heals. Note that I asked who had what buffs and if I need to do any backup buffs - see? I *know* your buffs are better. Please pay attention to the fact that I call my Complete Heals carefully, with an /emote that makes it very clear.  Understand that I have ten levels' experience using CH on everything from low rangers to Myrmidons. I know when to cast it. Watch the tanks; they trust me. You can too. <br />
<br />
Please do not do what some doubtlessly well-meaning Vicar did last night during a dragon raid, and send me a tell criticizing my choice  of buffs - when in reality I was simply following the written instructions laid out by the raid leader.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm not a Vicar like you. I also didn't buy my character on eBay. Is 53 days /played enough for you to trust me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">krela</div><div class="date">09-15-2000, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it quite sad to see people who cannot accept that some peoples playing styles are different to yours. This has nothing to do with being a higher level (I am a 32 cleric and this is amy only character), but even now I see it.<br />
<br />
As far as I am concerned the acid test is the only real thing you can judge people by. I naturally assume from the tone of your post that you are a great cleric (you follow instructions for raids, you seem to learn from experience, and you care). That is what matters.<br />
<br />
Do people die because you did things 'wrong' somehow I think not, that is what matters.<br />
<br />
People that have 2 or 3 levels on you seem to think that they know more than you. Like you say you have had cheal for 10 levels already, what difference does another 2 or 3 levels make. If you were lvl39 then granted, you only just got the spell and maybe could take some advice.<br />
<br />
I guess what it comes down to is that having done something before does not mean you know how to do it the 'right' way. It just means you have done it before.<br />
<br />
Thessalian, I hope that this is just a minor gripe, don't let it bother the fun you may have in the game. It's kinda like whineplay, some people will always feel superior or that they know better, but advice is after all is just advice. If you feel you are doing a good job then stick with it, and don't compromise yourself.<br />
<br />
*hugs*<br />

<br />
Unless something is drastically wrong, I will not advise anyone on how to play their character.  If something can be improved by trying something, I will send a tell saying 'Have you tried...'<br />
<br />
Everyone has their own way of dealing with certain situations.  Sometimes their tactics are better than mine, sometimes not.<br />
<br />
I do lose concentration sometimes, but everyone does that at some point.  Clerics can get the brunt of someone's anger if they make a mistake, since a cleric's mistake is more fatal than a mistake by another character.<br />
<br />
Some of the best clerics I have teamed with are unguilded, so I do not presume any cleric to be bad.<br />
<br />
There are very few bad clerics, some poor.  The best clerics are those who admit to making mistakes and are open in trying to learn from their mistakes.<br />
<br />
Most people that tell clerics what to do are people that have no idea what a cleric can do...usually they have played one character (normally a warrior, in my experience) and maybe played a cleric to level 5.<br />
<br />
If they have not played a cleric to the same level as you, it is likely that they don't know all the clerics' tactics.<br />
<br />
As for other clerics ordering you to do something their way, there is a simple option -<br />
<br />
Disband<br />
/lfg on<br />
/ooc cleric lfg<br />
Especially at higher levels, you normally don't have to wait too long.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thessalian</div><div class="date">09-15-2000, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the responses. <br />
<br />
I don't like to generalize, truly I don't. If it didn't happen *regularly* I would not have written the message. I'm not much of a ranter to begin with.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif When it comes down to it, I think the reason it bothers me so much is that I never get to feel any camraderie with my fellow clerics - it seems, at least on my server, that they have all become just a little bit egotistical due to our being this most essential of classes, being in constant demand for resurrects, etc. <br />
<br />
It's almost as if another cleric comes along and they feel that their sacred position as cleric is being threatened - they are no longer the only almighty healer and rezzer to be protected at all costs, to take their pick of groups, etc. <br />
<br />
Again, this may be on my server only (I don't see anyone else mentioning these odd attitudes), and I do apologize for the generalization.. But I just needed to vent. I will continue to meet new players of all classes and levels with an open mind, as I always have.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siren</div><div class="date">09-15-2000, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard of this type of thing happening before also and it disgusts me.<br />
<br />
I *love* having a second cleric in a group, especially when there is no enchanter.  <br />
<br />
Being able to split buffs is sooo nice.  Before getting Naltron's Mark and Donal's Greaves, it could cost me as much as 4620 mana to fully buff my group. (This is drastically reduced if I have more casters and don't buff as much AC).  That is almost 2 bars of mana.  Having a second cleric to split buffs with is heavenly!  Whether they are your level, lower level, or higher level.<br />
<br />
Also - it is FUN to have a second cleric and get to use some of our nukes.  It's not like we get to use them all that often.  <br />
<br />
Definately, disband and find a new group if a jealous cleric doesn't appreciate you and your contributions to a group.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">09-15-2000, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh I don't think this problem is specific to 51+ clerics. I've seen people behave this way at least 20 levels earlier. Some classes don't work together very naturally, and clerics are one of those classes (enchanters are another). In this situation, use tells to figure out who will do what, and use any leftover mana at your discretion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rennhelm</div><div class="date">09-16-2000, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever there have been two clerics in the same group, every time I've been the higher level of the two.  And without exception we've always agreed that I will be the armored wizard and nuke / stun away while he / she heals.  Simply because of the resists...<br />
<br />
But anyway, this places the much more important job in the hands of the lower level cleric.  I've never given it a second though, really.  I suppose I've silently taken note of things they did and mentally compared it to my own style, just to double-check my playstyle to make sure I'm doing all I can to ensure the group's success.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">09-17-2000, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To Don't feel too bad, I'm 52nd and I still get that snobbery crap from other clerics.<br />
<br />
Usually it's the ones in full EM with an uber guild tag.<br />
<br />
Hell with em.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  You've made your levels, and you've earned them.  Tell them so.<br />
<br />
You just have to speak up sometimes.  There are a number of high-level nimrods - they have a lot of spare time, and big guilds to help them get their equipment.  But it doesn't make them good clerics.<br />
<br />
Don't let the bastards get you down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinanar</div><div class="date">09-17-2000, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify - I do empathise with the situation you find yourself in.<br />
<br />
Salina has expressed my opinion on people telling others how to play their classes.<br />
<br />
Usually, the higher level cleric in a multi-cleric group is the one who should be stunning and nuking, for one simple reason - A higher level character will have less resists.<br />
<br />
It is not right to criticize the choice of buffs used.  Normally, I explain to the group if they are getting a lesser buff. (The cost of casting Shield of Words outweighs the benefits - lots of mana for +6 AC? bah!)<br />
<br />
It would be better to ask why certain buffs are not used.  Inquiring into tactics is always much better than being pushy.<br />
<br />
So, to those who criticize fellow clerics, try this - learn if the group has worked together a lot.  If they have, their tactics have been practised a lot and perfected.  Don't just change their tactics because you want to.  <br />
<br />
I have learned to change group tactics without being pushy.  <br />
<br />
In high level parties, asking the question 'Who is the main tank?' can make the party re-organise very quickly.  It signals your intention to have a main tank that you heal.<br />
<br />
I hope this post has been some help.<br />
