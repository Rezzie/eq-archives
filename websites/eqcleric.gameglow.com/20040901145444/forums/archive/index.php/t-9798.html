<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">02-28-2000, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night, my group is in Rathe trying to make Mortificator spawn for our monk... another fruitless night (finally found a spawn worse than pre-patch Gull and Babbins -- and all greeny ph's here too.  another day with 0 experience).  Anyhow... a level 15 enters the zone from Lake Rathe end and starts asking questions about the icon off the red giant skelly.  I start giving him help... he ignores my first advice (get a map)... and my second advice (don't come here at 15 unless you know what you're doing, without some form of invis rathe can be dangerous to just go wandering around).  Needless to say, he proceeds to cross the zone... after one little mishap (found the troll tower to the west of the scarab alter) he got to the ruins.  There were a cleric and pally (I think) there already, trying to get the icon.  He tells me that he's talked to them and they said they would get him an icon.<br />
<br />
Well, this bothers me a bit -- after all, I waited until I could take it before getting mine -- but I try not to resent this pup getting his at 15th.  Then the questions start...<br />
Can you buff me?<br />
Can I loot that cyclops (after one aggro'd on us... stupid greenie clops)?  [Said while we're fighting]<br />
<br />
And then he started trying to &quot;help&quot; both our group and the group at the ruins.  Since we were mainly killing lizzies and low teens stuff he was ok there -- but he was attacking the other groups skels off and on as well.  I was just waiting for &quot;can you res me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Now I thought I had gone out of my way to help just by giving directions to the ruins and telling him how to get the icon (2 center spawns, etc.).  When you go into newbie zones you sort of expect people anymore to barrage you with requests for money and such -- but I thought that this was uncalled for behavior in Rathe...  I wasn't rude to him (although it was certainly tempting), so maybe that encouraged further questions.  I don't mind helping someone out, but when it changes from &quot;I've got a question&quot; to &quot;can you babysit me?&quot; (which is how I was feeling) I begin losing my patience...<br />
<br />
Am I being unreasonable?  Or how do the rest of you feel about something like this?  I've gotten used to seeing level 5 twinks in full ranger armor -- but something just bothered me about this (maybe warriors feel the same way about Painbringer)...<br />
<br />
Or is this the &quot;new&quot; EQ, with level 20 twinks hanging out in lguk asking if they can loot that mino elder because they are tired of their bi medallion?   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just really bad on Tunare, since it seems the fad right now is to make a twink cleric (when there are more clerics in Cazic than rogues, you have to begin wondering)  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Flames welcome -- honest opinions appreciated  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">02-28-2000, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm. This one gets my goat at times too.<br />
<br />
I don't mind some of them minding their own business and ask for a buff once in awhile to lower downtime, and don't ask for it at the expense of my group. <br />
<br />
I DO however, take offense to the type of person you're describing. I tend to ignore them after a bit, and when they die, they're NOT getting ressed. Plain and simple. It's one thing to request a buff once in awhile. It's another to make a pain of yourself. <br />
<br />
I guess alot of these people aren't seeing the amount of work it's taken some of us to get to the point we are, and for us to turn around and make it alot easier for them, doesn't season them really well. <br />
<br />
Question: If Moron A dies alot, he learns not to die, hence one less moron on the server (Ya, ya, I used to be moron A once a looong time ago - Wop at the front gates being my most noticeable example &amp;lt;G&amp;gt; )<br />
If Moron B gets helped alot, and doesn't die much, getting resses alot, the xp loss isn't as pronounced, so they don't worry about dying as much, so they don't learn much and STAY moron B at a much higher level....<br />
<br />
Put these two people together: Which would you want in YOUR group?<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;/Vent Off&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
You asked for an honest opinion. That's mine. No offense intended, no names mentioned, no particular people this is based on either...</div></div><hr />

If he doesn't know how to get it on his own he shouldn't be expecting other people to help him figure out how! Its guys like that who gives twinks like me a bad name!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomma</div><div class="date">03-01-2000, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have a problem with this too. <br />
<br />
Last night, I was working the Kobold Champ spawn in Sol B,, &amp; was trying to get a Painbringer for my high 20's warrior alt. <br />
At this level, HE can't get a group, but at least can defened HIMself.  So, then 2 15L Troll Warriors waddle up, expecting to get a PB. <br />
<br />
You KNOW the folks doing this,, are working on thier 2nd or 3rd characterss.  I mean, sure there's plenty of good maps around, but they do nothing to explain how a zone flows.<br />
<br />
How would a complete newbie,, know it would be safe enuf,, to walk DIRECTLY to Kobold Champ &amp; have a seat?  Still, thier experience does NOT mean they deserve to loot a PB.  Yet, these teenagers walk in,, causing us concern.  1) for thier safety 2) for fear they'll simply steal a PB that doesn't belong to them.<br />
<br />
Where was I going?<br />
