The trick is to team up with a cleric and then just do what I did in Oasis when I was a young cleric:<br />
Pull a mob to where the cleric is medding, whack it senseless and grab the nessesary heals. Fast non-stop pulling and a steady xp.<br />
<br />
Grouping is also nice, as you can kill many sarnaks and higher gobos here.<br />
<br />
The level range here is very good starting at around 15, head to FM when you reach 30, come back when you are 44.<br />
