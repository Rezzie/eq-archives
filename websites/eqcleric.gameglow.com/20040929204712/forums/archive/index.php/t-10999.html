<br />
Also, it was a lot less boring and the pp wasn't too bad either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also got luck with Lord Burg in LR.  He was just sitting there waiting for me when I went to start camping him. :p <br />
<br />
I hope you don't have to camp it for much monger. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gimblox took me about  6 days on and off, with an overall time of about 36 hours.<br />
<br />
Ragefire , took me 44  straight...go figure.<br />

I got both after 3 spawn cycles. <br />
<br />
Yes I had the shimmering pearl on my druid, but that was back in the good ol' days of Rage camping in Sol B.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ragefire on the other had took 152 hours...</div></div><hr />

He took maybe 3 hours for me.<br />
<br />
Gimblox took me two days...   logging on and off.<br />
<br />
Ragefire, I must admit would have been horrid...Thank Tunare that I am a member of an awesome guild....  We have tons of two<br />
boxers, that kept someone at his (new) camp , and I was at work at the time he spwaned.   One of the officers that had my info,<br />
logged me on, and the rest is history:)....<br />
<br />
Although we did have to contact a GM, for a ninja looter from another guild, but it was resolved in a couple hours, and i had <br />
a heart container in my posession when I logged on that evening.<br />

<br />
Time spent camping Ragefire (right after changes): 11 hours, spread over 3 days.<br />
<br />
Guess I built some karma up on the Gimblox camp. &lt;grin&gt;<br />
