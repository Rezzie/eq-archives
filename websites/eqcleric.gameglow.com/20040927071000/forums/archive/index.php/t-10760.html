<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">02-20-2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I can get my first cleric hate raid invite if I can get out of 45 and to 47 in two weeks of average play time.<br />
<br />
I have a 56 Necro that will assist me or a 44 Warrior assist me and thus I want the best options for a fast 2 levels.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?<br />
<br />
Warrior / Cleric go to Nurga and grind through it<br />
<br />
Cleric Solo's Specs in Oasis with Necro feeding mana and killing spec when under half<br />
<br />
Cleric solo in DL undead area (insert necro action here again)<br />
<br />
Cleric and Necro do the trolls and ogres in Neriak grouped.<br />
<br />
Ideas?  I only have 2 weeks elapsed thus need something that will not be camped, I only play 2 hours a night and have 8 nights play time available so I need the best option for 1 hell level and one fast level for the cleric.<br />
<br />
Suggestions ????</div></div><hr />

That is the best I have ever found (or may find) for passing time in 45.  I dunno what Happ will con in 46, but a blue every six kills with a respawn every six minutes seems good enough to me.  Either way, I wish you luck!<br />

Take the tank if you want him to get some exp, or the necro for pure PLing. With me and a 45-46 monk there, we were both getting a gold an hour in 45, better in 46.<br />
<br />
Bloodgills in LOIO are another good high exp option, especially working with the necro (DMF /cheer).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">02-20-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember the part of not waiting for a camp.  The options I presented all are no wait options SOLB seems to me to be a hurry up and wait, then run to another spot situation.  <br />
<br />
Same with Hopp, if it is camped (what is likely hood on Terris Thule?) then I would be out of luck for the night as I have no porting options.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Javara</div><div class="date">02-20-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience I thought that the spectre was &quot;slightly&quot; better exp than Happ, however I have never found Happ camped on Brell.  The single spectre in Feerot is often camped on Brell but you can always try the 3 in the cave with help or the troll gaurds in Rathe.  Either way it doesn't sound like they would get you enough exp in the amount of playtime you have.<br />
<br />
I have never done bloodgills in LOIO but heard many rave about the exp there.  If they were camped it would be a short run to DL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rosieana</div><div class="date">02-20-2002, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also highly recommend getting out of 45 in SolB killing dogs.  I was able to get out of 45 in two days of leveling there duoing with my magician husband.  Otherwise if it's camped you guys can always head over to the DL and kill things there.  Also I tried soloing as a cleric, I have always found that to be boring, and I do not level faster soloing.  I level a lot faster grouping up with other people.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">02-21-2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you all for the great suggestions.  I will try the Oasis specs as the necro can solo pull them and I will just kill them fast and there is at least 4 of them on that island.<br />
<br />
Most kind ty, all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">02-22-2002, 05:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the matter with L Guk?<br />
That place is rather deserted on BB but the FrEnZy camp can always use a cleric.<br />
<br />
Or get that necro and warrior with you. At 54 he can still get some decent xp at AM/GL area.<br />
<br />
I love that place and. It's even better now at 58 because when I'm there I get to pull. Pulling is the most fun job  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyfeara</div><div class="date">02-22-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was able to go from 43 to 47 in a little over a week (not playing 24/7) in CoM with a ranger partner.  CoM is an outside zone and usually was not, if ever crowded.  There were many times when we were the only two there.  We did a cycle of about 9-14 mobs that the ranger would pull near zone, so pretty low risk also, especially once you break them &amp; get them timed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serenya</div><div class="date">02-22-2002, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will echo City of Mist.  My warrior and my monk's husband went from low 45 to low 47 in about two or three nights while hunting mostly with a bard and a cleric there.  It's generally empty, and we were pulling low blues.  Split pulling of course helped tremendously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerlin</div><div class="date">02-22-2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">L Guk would be great. You and your necro pal should be able to take sage, Am, and probably Frenzy ( if its not camped..I'd suggest early morning)<br />
<br />
Or try LOIO and do bloodgills http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Exp mod is much higher, no one goes there, once you learn your way around, you can just roam around killing all kinds of stuff and have an absolute blast.<br />
<br />
44 warrior and 45 cleric coudl do some damage there.  56 necro would just eat it up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dian</div><div class="date">02-25-2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well LGUK is a no go as I have no invis options to get to the undead side and as my post indicated I want some place to log on, not have to fight for camps and fight for an hour or two and log off.<br />
<br />
From your fine responses Oasis or DL seem the best choices here as Blood Gils are perma camped, Kaesora is out as my warrior friend is an Ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyfeara</div><div class="date">02-25-2002, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kaesora is great, one of my favorite places.  But best experience there is really from levels 30-40, the experience starts to really slow down the closer you get to 45 (in my experience).  But there are also many nice drops there and the fang needed for the HS key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">02-26-2002, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been using Kaesora and CoM for a long time and they are great.<br />
<br />
Though I use Kaesora at about 25 or so up to 35.  Then jump over to Droga for 35 to 40 and finally CoM for 40 to 45 or even higher.<br />
<br />
I have found that all of these (and I usually do a 3 or 4 person group) land us each about an orange an hour if not more.<br />
<br />
I did Seafuries with a warrior and Druid but without someone to snare that would suck.</div></div><hr />
