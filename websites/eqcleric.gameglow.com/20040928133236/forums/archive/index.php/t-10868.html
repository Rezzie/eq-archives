<br />
Are you on giant or dragon faction? <br />
<br />
If on dragon faction - are *everyone* non kos to CoV? <br />
<br />
If on giant faction - do you have *anyone* thats not kos to cov - mage/cleric/monk in particular?<br />
<br />
Further, how many people do you have and what levels/classes?<br />

<br />
1. Getting to ToV will be easy as you are not KoS to CoV - so you dont have to worry about Sontalak. Have all casters bind right outside.<br />
<br />
2. Move everyone down into ToV - down the picture hall and setup in the hub room facing Zemm.<br />
<br />
3. Have your monks open the door behind Zemm and jump into the pit just behind. Have those figure out when they can pull a single wurm. Dont be afraid to try a few times to get it right.<br />
<br />
4. Pull the wurm back up from the pit staying beyond the door and have everyone rush and kill it. Be buffed with cr and fr (used to be only cr, but I think they fixed that).<br />
<br />
5. Apply beatdown.<br />
<br />
6. Repeat 4 and 5.<br />
<br />
7. Once pit is clear - move your raid down there and pull from either side. Look into the east door at your own risk   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
8. Thats the hardest part of HoT really. From here just have your monks scout well, pull singles and keep a watch on the roamers.<br />
<br />
9. The named (drops parts for quests) can hit hard. One particular place seemed to often yield 2 of those - but always be prepared to split tank, you have the crew for it.<br />
<br />
From a clerics viewpoint - buff hp, cr, fr - and have ae heals ready. Also, have chanters sieve more often than not until you learn which mobs need that and which dont.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zuht</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few quick questions about HoT since you seem to know a lot about it =)<br />
<br />
-Does everyone have to be +CoV because of the trip there or is it necessary for fighting once in place?  We have a +CoV mage and cleric but everyone else is kos<br />
<br />
-Are there any faction hits on the mobs there?<br />
<br />
My guild has been in ToV for a long time getting people Kael armor and we still don't have any real idea when we will be able to turn around and get SS armor for the +CoV people who have put up with us this whole time =)  I'm wondering basically if it is possible to CoTH people over and do HoT with a 90% pro-giant crew</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norin Grimsbane</div><div class="date">07-07-2001, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It shouldn't be terribly hard to do HoT with a ProGiant crew - you'd need to clear the Hub first so that you don't aggro CoV aligned NPCs during the first few pulls of HoT, though.  If you've been farming Kael armor, you'd have no problems from there.  Just be aware of respawn and remind the ProDragon guys not to take faction hits when you have to kill the CoV Drakes   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Few notes to clear up my answers:<br />
<br />
HoT NPCs have no faction and are KoS to everyone.<br />
<br />
There are CoV aligned Drakes near the entrance to HoT (at the Hub).<br />
<br />
There's no way to my knowledge to avoid these CoV Drakes while breaking into HoT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-07-2001, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our guild did try doing HoT with KoS to CoV people. Its probably doable - but breaking the first pit gets more risky. We generally found that Zemm tended to aggro through the door on the KoS people a little too often for our liking. But, it might be possible to CoH everyone in just past the door to HoT (no mobs here) and pull the pit - we just never bothered perfecting this as we had enough non KoS to break the pit and just CoH the kos there. Once the pit is clear being KoS to CoV means nothing really.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse you can just do what Norin suggests - clear the way getting more Kael armor on the way - though that obviously takes a bit of time.<br />
