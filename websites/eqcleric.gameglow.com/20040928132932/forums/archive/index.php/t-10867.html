Vaniki the rat in DN that drops the Willsapper.<br />
     My guild and I have tried him twice, both ending out in wipeouts since we had little to no info on him.  I'm looking on info on healing, bye the time that i started CHing on the main tank he droped to 0 health, like a fight with VS almost.  However i noticed that its a DD for 500 witch is my guess is unressistable.  How do you all normally go about healing for vaniki?  Do you chain CHes at the start of the fight?  It seemed to me that if I started it any later the tank would be dead anyhow.  Is Vaniki's proc always when he hits you or is it random?  Do you chain rune your main tank like with VS?  Or do should we just have every cleric concentrate on healing the main tank?  Any info would be appreciated.<br />

I have only seen him 2x though, once on the way to kill Zlandicar we sidetracked to kill the rat, he stood 0 chance, didn't live long.<br />
The other time was with 18 people. We used main tanking on it with all 3 clerics on the main tank at first. Once Vaniki was slowed though, I was able to keep up with heals on the warrior by myself.<br />
<br />
Never particulary loticed what he was casting, but once slowed a warrior using defensive wasn't taking damage to fast, even when Vaniki flurried.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue is that he can gate, gated both times I have been there, so we had to charge to his spawn to finish him off, then kill about half the room that agroed on us, lol.<br />
<br />
This is all with warriors in nearly full to full Myrmidon armor though, so mialage may varry on how fast your warriors die to him...<br />

When we fought him, we beat on him for about 5 minutes. We barely dented his HP and then it went right back up. Keeping the tanks alive was no problem til the mana ran out, but we couldn't keep ahead of the regen.<br />
<br />
Also, when did you fight him? I think he's been buffed recently.<br />

But with lesser force he can be a challenge. <br />
<br />
From what I have seen, that 500 DD you're talking about is actually a lifetap. As with any high level mob, landing a slow is the difference between triviality and wipeout. Some say that the way to stop the regen is using disease based DoT, but he does seem to be quite resistable. Our level 60 shaman had problems having it to stick.<br />

<br />
Get a high level warrior with defensive to tank him.  Get all your clerics to focus on healing your main tank, the rest of your tanks go in once your main tank has sufficient aggro.  Land tash, malo, turgurs and finally cripple on him.  Cripple is big because Vaniki flurries alot, casting Cripple seems to keep the flurries down.  Until you get slow to land, its good practice for multi cleric+single tank healing.  <br />
