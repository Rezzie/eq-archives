</FONT><HR>... with an aside on the fear line and how much I love it  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.<P>51+ exp sucks.<P>54 is a nighmare.<BR>55-60 is 5 more nightmares.<P>57 though, is a good level, and not because of Aegis.<P>It's the level that stuff in Karnor's no longer "assists" (except for cursed hands and other things way in the back).<P>Well, what does that mean for us?  It means Karnor's is a VERY viable dungeon to duo in for 57 and 58.<P>Grab a monk and go.<P>Karnor's is often likened to mistmoore in the frequency and potency.  But at 57 however, you can play crowd control as well as any enchanter, and you can heal too!<P>That's right, I'm talking about fear.<P>Dread of Night is an absolutely amazing spell in terms of resist rate and duration.  I kept both Dread of Night and Invoke Fear (for those doggies) up and I could duo with a monk at the zone line for hours with no problem.<P>Then my guild got me Donal's breastplate.<P>I just want to say that the way I used the BP to level me to 60 is the very definition why that BP is too powerful (shhh!!)  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.<P>After getting the BP, my monk friend and I who have been duoing almost exclusively (find 1 person to level with you is a LOT easier than finding 5) decided to see how much we can handle.<P>In Karnor's this was especially easy, because mobs didn't respond to healing.  Basically as a heal if you didn't sit down, you could heal to your hearts content and even monsters no one else had done damage to would switch onto you.<P>So we tried the battlements in the back.<P>Stayed there for 3 hours, watching the monk tank 3 things while I sat there at fm chain clicking and keeping him alive for free.<P>BTW - Fear is very good for fearing greenies in that situation, they run right to the zone line and never come back (and the 4 groups near the zone who are desperate for spawns don't complain either  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">).<P>We tried the hand room, stayed there for 3 or 4 days (no, not continuously :P) with no Donal's gloves dropping :/.<P>I hit 58 fairly quickly, then I realized the untapped abuses of the BP.  Namely, the manastone.<P>Manastone + BP means you never have to med.  3 bubbles of health while buffed (at 1 bubble mobs will often frenzy on you, best be safe) translates to about 1 bubbles of mana.<P>That means oom->fm takes around 2 minutes.<P>The problem 51+ is finding a place to level where there are a constant supply of blue mobs.<P>Option 1: The Hole<BR>You have green mobs mixed in with level 53 ones, I was there with my monk friend and a druid and the exp was bad and we ended up training out (evac lavastorm, to our second destination).<P>Option 2: Solusek B<BR>There are 2 places that give good exp.  One is the stone spider room.  LDC's are all blue at 58, and mostly blue at 59.  But, with the bp, a monk and I cleared every last LDC spawn in around 15 minutes, and had to wait for another 13 for them to respawn.  All in all, much better exp than anything in Kunark though.<P>The other is obviously Efreeti.  Efreeti is by far the best place for a cleric with a BP to be.<P>Imps/Lava Guardians have a very very predictable pattern of behavior.  They will switch to the healer very easily, but only if they are completely undamaged.  Once a tank does 100 or so damage to one, you can heal to your hearts content.<P>My my friend could tank 4 at level 59 with me chain clicking my BP.  If I had to buff, I would cast, stone back to FM, then c heal myself when he was only tanking one and I could afford to click myself before clicking him again.  In fact, when I was paying attention I could actually nuke twice per imp, stone back to full, click myself, before having to click the monk again.<P>We ended up duoing the Efreeti room, keeping all but 2 or 3 imp spawns clear.<P>To give you an idea of how sick the experience was, I just want to point out one number.<P>Zero exp into level 58, to level 60, took me 10 days total of leveling in sol b.  I have school and other obligations so I wasn't playing the game during the day, only on nights and weekends.<P>I averaged 1 bubble every 5-6 hours of /played in level 59.  I'm sure anyone who's gone through 59 can appreciate that number  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.<P>We generally worked around organized raids to efreeti, usually working out a deal to share the imp spawns, or clearing everything except the Efreeti room (a lot of raids they take multiple groups and aren't expecting exp, they are just there for boots, and a good half of them are thankful someone else is keeping the entire outside clear, the other half you just work out some kind of sharing of the spawns, since they rarely clear the entire imp area anyways).<P>Still though, the efreeti is almost always free on weeknights, and it's worth going, even just for 2-3 hours.  On weekends there's higher demand and you usually have to talk it out with the people who are already there.<P>Still, in my week in the efreeti area, one good thing has come out of this...  Between my monk friend and I, we got 19 pairs of eboots.  You end up with alot more when it's only split 2 ways  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">.  Trading away a pair of eboots is no longer a big deal for me.<P>We've had other groups and even guides visit us while we were in the Efreeti, most amazed by how we could function continuously with pulls of 2 or 3 with me never sitting down for a moment.<P>I know there's not alot of clerics out there in the situation of trying to level and have a Donal's BP and a manastone available to them (honestly though, the manastone was a bonus that basically allowed me to nuke in the efreeti room, we could've functioned just as well without it).  But, should you find yourself in that situation, USE IT TO ITS FULLEST POTENTIAL; go and do efreeti with 2 or 3 poeple!  It'll take away the pain off the kunark levels.<P>Miriana<BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Legions of Darkness<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>hmm, sounds like you are begging for a nerf. Even though it is great, all your doing is blowing a big horn for Verant to look at and nerf.  Yup we all know the BP is awsome but don't try to point out the ways it is too powerfull.  It has seemed that lately if someone points out how an item is good it getsw nerfed to nothing. Even though that might now have been your intent for your post, that is what I got from it.  <BR>just my 2copper peices.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>From what you are describing it sounds over powering.  But if you look at it from the total standpoint on how hard it is to obtain one of these items, it isn't that big of a thing.  In addition, not everybody has a mana stone.  They took mana stones out of the game just before I was to the level where camping it with a group was viable.  The prices of them on my server run into the astronomical figures.  In addition to being very limited where you can use a mana stone, they aren't all that practical.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>58th Dwarven Templar<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Sounds like a great way to level; except for the simple fact that few clerics have the bp and well, it doesn't sound any more exciting then sitting on my backside in Sebilis.<P>I leveled in HS - one good group, in the south wing. East wing is a blast, but it's more difficult and more of a camp with Drusella, rather than exp. But one balanced group can do amazing things in HS and the experience is better than anywhere else. I filled L59 in two evenings there, with a full group including three L60s - an hour the next day finally dinged me. Total play time for 59 was approx 10 hours and it was a BLAST. HS requires that you keep on your toes until you get the wing down, then you can have fun with nukes and melee (CoF and L58 chanter buffs were a blast) =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Yeah, unfortunately being that the manastone can only be used in pre-Kunark. non-plane zones, the only places they are really useful for is Sol B and The Hole.  Unfortunately, while The Hole is a fairly fun dungeon to /do/, it's an absolute nightmare to level in.<P>That leaves the imps in sol b as the only place a 55+ person who wants to use the manastone can exp.<P>In any case, the manastone isn't really the important part, you can do everything I said above without one.<P>The BP IS too powerful.  It allows you + tank to solo anything that can't kill the tank in 20 seconds.  Think about it.  It doesn't matter how many hp the mob has, if it can't kill the tank in 20 seconds you just chain click and you will kill that monster without spending a single point of mana.<P>The BP is a balanced item for a full group.  The casting time makes it a GOOD item and a downtime reducer, but it's not overpowering.<P>When you are duoing, the BP is overpowering.<P>The thing is, extending the casting time doesn't hurt the BP signifigantly in duoing situations.<P>Let's say you increase the BP cast time from 20 to 30 seconds.  Ok, now you've limited what a melee/cleric combo can duo to anything that won't kill the melee in 30 seconds.  That's still overpowering.  One tank can still tank 2 blues indefinitely.<P>However, increasing the casting time from 20 to 30 seconds signifigantly hurts the effectiveness of the BP in groups, which is not where the problem lies.<P>The only way to make the BP not overpowering in duoing situations is to make the casting time insanely long, like 45 seconds or greater.  If you do that though, you make it completely worthless in group situations.<P>A better effect for the BP would've been a 1 second casting time Celestial Elixer effect.<P>Since it's a regen component, you put a hard cap on how fast your target is gaining back HP.  By making the casting time very short, you make it viable to keep it on multiple tanks and increase the effectiveness of the BP as the number of people in the group increase, instead of an inverse relationship.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Miriana<BR>High Priestess of Tunare<BR>Legions of Darkness<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004465&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=004465&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
