I don't typically get a ton of time to play all at once, so I have to have a place where I can kill something now and then, but still be safe if I need to leave the computer for a few.<br />
<br />
Dragnor's Cauldron has worked out pretty well so far.  I'm bound at the mouth of the canyon to BB, and I pull blue aqua gobs and skeles to near the fab four.  If I can't take them myself, the four will help me out.  Note that the four don't hit very hard, so it can get pretty tight if a tidal lord decides to attack me after a fight.<br />
<br />
If I need to leave the PC, I can just run up the canyon a little ways and med.  Very low train risk, though not totally safe if someone picks something up on their way back from Unrest.<br />
<br />
Just thought I'd throw this out.  If anyone else has suggestions for a good place to hunt at 19, I'd love to hear it.  (I've been to Lake of Ill Omen, too...but didn't explore too much there.)<br />

Yes, I know, what about the nasty undead that wander?  Well, from my personal experience (hunted with 3 characters there, pre and post Kith-upgrade), and a co-worker's, if you sit as close to the zone wall as possible, nothing will come even close enough to aggro you.<br />
<br />
If you get a partner, or small group, you can really clean up.  There are 4 spawns, the highest being level 19.  3 of the spawns have placeholders, which can provide you with time to med and additional safety (no need to lull/mez if all the placeholders are up).<br />
<br />
They did nerf the loot a bit, so don't expect to come out of there with a fortune.<br />
<br />
I generally use this spot as an alternative to HH, which (provided you get into a group) is also a great spot.<br />
