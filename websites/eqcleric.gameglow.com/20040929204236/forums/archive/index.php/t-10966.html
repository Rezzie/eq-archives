<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">06-27-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in a new, very small guild.  In fact, Verant hasn't gotten around to making our guild yet, so we aren't really a guild yet.  But, we all came from a moderately powerful guild, just short of NToV.<br />
<br />
We figured we'd have our first raid on Velketor, because we used to do him with ease.  However, he cleaned our clocks.  We got him down to 50% and inevitably we'd wipe.  The cheal chain was at 40 pause while the warrior was defensive, 20 when it was off.<br />
<br />
We knew it'd be a long battle because we only had 1 GB wizard.  We had about 25 people, nearly all level 60, on our last try.<br />
<br />
Has Velketor been beefed up a bit in the last set of patches, or are we just not doing enough DPS?</div></div><hr />

Did it with just a single tank and 4 clerics, just had to have the DPS to finish him off..<br />

<br />
The druid's were having a devilishly hard time with nukes.  Nothing was sticking to him.  Even RFS was bouncing.<br />
<br />
It seemed like he was meleeing a lot more than before.  But I haven't parsed the log yet to verify that.</div></div><hr />

last time me guild took him we only lost the MA, because Velk dispelled his buffs and promptly beat him to death.  was a fun fight  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
I didnt hear any changes in his resists from the wizards or the other casters.<br />

<br />
My recommendation is to have a debuff group there primary goal it to continuely debuff him so that he spends more time trying to Annul himself than he does nuking also having a few paladins or tanks with stun/knockbacks is handy.  The stun doesn't stun him but the knockback interrupts his spell casting still.<br />

He uses AE now wich is no big deal.  We did him the other night with 30ish people, not sure on all levels there.  No deaths.<br />
<br />
FYI - Debuff him se he spends more time casting on himself and not nuking.</div></div><hr />

It could be that he went OOM earlier from the new spells and his heavy melee started early.</div></div><hr />
