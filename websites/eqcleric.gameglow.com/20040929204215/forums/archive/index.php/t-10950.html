<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">pace, ya only need 2 clerics for debuffing klandicar, once klandicar is slowed, you certainly don't need any chain whatsoever.<br />
<br />
also zlandicar doesn't seem to work well with a chain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I guess I was a little terse. Here's the fuller version:<br />
<br />
Zland - zerg fight, like Trak... too much damage output and too little HP for anything more organized. No point in CH rotation on this one. Just spam heal whoever is getting hit.<br />
<br />
Kland - Stick 2 clerics on a rotation, have someone assigned to heal them if they get low health. Keep MT on one side and have everyone else hit from behind, if at all possible. Load up on MR gear to prevent fear.<br />
<br />
Lendi - 3 cleric rotation, go straight HP/mana on this one. Longer fight than Kland/Zland but not too much more difficult. Group healing from clerics/paladins/necros is the way to keep everyone alive.<br />
<br />
Yelinak - 4 cleric rotation with a healthy mod rod supply. Can be a pretty long fight, keep MT between Yelinak and the gate. Keep the gate closed. Position CH rot in between gate and MT, so when the knockback hits the clerics will stay in range. All other melee on the other side.<br />
<br />
Sontalaak - Another spam heal fight. Like Lendi in that you'll take a good deal of AE damage so group healers are the way to go. Like Zland in that his damage output is absurd and you have to zerg him fast before AE takes you all out. Assist, spam, assist, spam, assist, spam. If this fight takes more than 2 minutes you will be doing CR. The difference between a total wipeout and killing him with no deaths can be tiny.<br />
<br />
'spam heal' = chain cast Divine Light on whoever is getting hit, make an 'assist Zlandicar' key or something to that effect.<br />
<br />
'zerg fight' = don't bother to try and control aggro, every moment you're not doing maximum damage is a moment closer to losing the fight. Just have your casters nuke from melee range so the mob doesn't jump around.<br />
<br />
Also make sure everyone has right-clicky items to counteract the effect of AE dispels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">05-03-2002, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering...<br />
<br />
Have you tried to kill Sont since his little<br />
'upgrade'?  His damage output is phenominal now...<br />
<br />
We actually had...weird..success trying a<br />
double MT rotation when trying Zland with<br />
too few people.  Since it can go to hell in<br />
a proverbial handbasket if the MT gets<br />
feared, we do two seperate MT rotations (in<br />
group of course) in case one gets feared.<br />
<br />
Of course if our whole guild shows up like it<br />
did last time, pretty much a couple group<br />
heals and one CH and Zland is already dead.<br />
<br />
We tried Kland for only the second time this<br />
week (don't ask, we have never killed Gore<br />
either, but kill KT, CT, NToV, ITV...it's<br />
weird).  First try we got to relearn how<br />
much dragons like killing clerics.  Next try<br />
I was the only cleric to die (first CH to hit<br />
after he started taking damage) and we got<br />
him slowed, so we won.  Not only did he just<br />
drop Boots (and talisman and crap spells),<br />
but he dropped WORKED boots.<br />
<br />

You still have to zerg him to take him down though. We might have had a CH rot going, I'm not sure... it's not very effective when the MT gets dispelled, loses haste, then loses aggro.</div></div><hr />
