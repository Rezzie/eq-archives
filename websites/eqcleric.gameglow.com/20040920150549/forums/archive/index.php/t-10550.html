Also, get a few tanks and go after them Cyclops!  I started killing them at 26 with a 26 tank and a druid for damage shield.  Did ok, but downtime was pretty high.  Now at 27, get 2 tanks 27-30 and a druid/shaman and have a field day!  Revenge is sooooo sweet!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenobe</div><div class="date">04-03-2000, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Taking Kaitlyn's advice (thanks  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif) I hunted the ruins there while waiting for Big Red to spawn.  This is a great zone for us.  I was taking on drybones, barbedbones, monks and GS.  By myself and sometimes with a tank of 25-30 I could eaisly fight here. There are 9 spawn points and if you are solo just leave the greenies alone and they will not come when you pull. I did this and was pulling singles easy enough.  The zone is close too just in case.<br />
<br />
Big Red never did spawn for me but I got level 26 back (darn MM) and Barbedbones drop FS. This place is great xp at my level and the 32 level Necro was getting good xp off the GS's.<br />

Big red spawns about four or five times a night like this.  He's our favorite to kill.  hehe.<br />
<br />
Had a bad pull once, but it turned out ok.  Someone in my group pulled big red, but also pulled two other giants and a dry boned.  Good thing I had spook up.  I spooked the two giants and the dry boned and ran them around in circles until my group was ready for them.  Then I pulled them back and droped off a giant,  then ran the dry boned and giant around.  We got them all.  turned a bad pull around with that one.  hehe.</div></div><hr />
