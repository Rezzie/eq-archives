<br />
1.  What is the maximum sv that will give you benifit.<br />
2.  Do certain spells require you to have higher resists in order to counteract?<br />
3.  How big a part does level play, is it the deciding factor?  Is it the only factor and we fool ourselves to thinking that having 300 sv will help.<br />
4.  Will someone see any benifit from having 250 resistance over 200, remembering that lucky plays a part in everything in probably the same way to 5% being the lowest chance of fizzling, there probably is always a 5% chance of a spell sticking?  Is this last statement true - remembering that 5% chance could give the impression of 0%.<br />
<br />
What im planning on doing is getting a level 60 necro to duel various different level people, with different types of spells, with different saves.<br />
<br />
Work out the effect of levels, work out at what point you start to see diminishing returns for saves.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to get a formula at the end of it such as<br />
<br />
maximum save = 100 + ( difference in mob level*10) + spell save level.<br />
<br />
So for example if you were fighting trakanon at level 60 you might need 150+spell save level(say 50) or 200 to reach maximum efficiency with saves.<br />
<br />
If anyone else has a few ideas (other than more is good :&gt;) or has any data please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khalim - Innoruuk</div><div class="date">03-13-2001, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You won't see the true resist factoring in doing tests in a PvP environment and trying to use those results to apply to a PvE encounter, things in PvP work very differently than they do against mobs.  For the most part (I may get ruined here by the Zek's, but this is from the tests I did)  In PvP, 100 MR will prevent almost all magic based spells from landing, regardless of level, assuming they are *all or nothing spells*, and cannot hit for partial damage, eg. root, stun, snare etc.  MR below 100 ends up being almost a flat percentage save vs those same spells, eg. with 50 MR, you will resist root 10 out of 20 attempts, 75 MR 15/20.  Its almost scary how close the tests I did were to the numbers, in fact, they worked out *exact* with a sample size of 10 casts against varying MR, using people of various levels to compare the results.<br />
<br />
  In my experience in PvE, level is god, and I think you take a serious penalty for every level you are below the mob.  I shoot for 200 resist for most things we do, unless I have a bard in group, then it goes through the roof.  But for my guild, 200 is the general rule to shoot for.<br />

<br />
MR/CR 157/165<br />
MR/FR 157/166<br />
MR/PR 166/138 (I know 115pr + buffs + potion = 255)<br />
MR/DR 157/111 (still lacking alot)<br />
<br />
All numbers unbuffed with wisdom running around 175 unbuffed - and I still believe I need more to be at the optimum.<br />
