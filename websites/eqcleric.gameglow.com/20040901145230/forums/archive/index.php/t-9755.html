I do feel that we get the shaft in EQ. heh and y not i mean no one could survive without us! but the whole sit-in thing...i know we have bad quests i totally understand.  But! the only reason we are having a sit-in is cuz dem crazy monks did it first! and ya know what? in a few days WFP will be a zone no one will be able to enter. every class, every race will want a sit in! whats next?! halflings want a sit in cuz they have hairy feet, DEs want a sit in because they are KOS, ogres will want one cuz they have green stuff in their ears, humans for their complete lack of nightvision, gnomes cuz they r small...and the list goes on. All i am saying is quit the damn sit-ins. We've got great reasoning but there has to be a better way. Being an annoyance by not letting people do their business in a zone they MANY people are bound too just isnt right. I do feel that Verant will stop sit-ins and im sorry that they will but it will get overused<br />
ok man thats my 2cp<br />
(FYI- did the monk sit-in change anything...)</div></div><hr />

Everyone has a right to protest in whatever means necessary to get a response...  as I see it &quot;Verant&quot; does not respond very well to /tell's, /bug's, /feedback, or anything similar.  I dont believe people should go to this sit in for the sole purpose of annoying people on Fennin Ro.. but I do believe they have a right to act out against such non responive nature they are used to.<br />
<br />
I for one am still highly annoyed at Verant and GM's for the lack of care in which they handled my specific issues which caused my character to be killed numerous times in a &quot;Charming bug&quot; by Meldrath and inevitably the deletion of my original Saeros.  24 levels down the drain.  Now granted I enjoy this version of Saeros much better but I am still bitter about the whole situation...  So I applaud any who show up to stand up for what they believe is right.   I also commend those that choose to not attend for the same reason.  Everyone has a right to their own opinion on such things and i have no right to force my opinion on another.  I can make simple suggestions but that is it... <br />
<br />
Stop being a Lemming and stand for what you believe in.<br />

but i doubt it..  hehe<br />
<br />
not that i approve of the sit in.. i do not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newnan</div><div class="date">12-04-1999, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ur absolutly right, in some ways cuz Verant is a bunch of stoners that only care about their lil druids (and i honestly feel that way, it should be called everdruid)and i know that a sit-in sounds great because they never reply to petitions reports etc <br />
but i bet in the next month we c at least a few more petitions (in WFP of course on fennin ro, itd have to be on the most populated server...makes sense?)<br />
now i stopped by the sit-in last night and all i saw were about 30 people actually sitting and the rest were being dipsh**s and attacking Boomba The Big or saying lets kill guards! Now cmon we r supposed to be taken seriously when these idiots piled, at last count, 27 corpses around boomba. <br />
:sigh: for the way those clerics acted yesterday im not surprised if not a damn thing happens. <br />
and saeros i agree with what ur saying but i wasnt trying to force my opnions on anyone i was trying to explain that we could have a very nasty lil situation brewing<br />
PS i do feel that most people in EQ r idiots,myself included  (^-^)</div></div><hr />
