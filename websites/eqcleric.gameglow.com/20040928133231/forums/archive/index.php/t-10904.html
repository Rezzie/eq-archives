<br />
If you, or people you know, have a problem with getting booted to the black &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; screen, or otherwise lagging horribly once fights start on big raids, here is what you need to do.<br />
<br />
Go to whatever directory you have everquest installed to and look for a file named DataRate.txt.<br />
<br />
Open DataRate.txt with notepad, or whatever text editor you use.<br />
<br />
The default number in the file is 5.0, change it to 7.0 if you have a modem connection, or 9.0 if you have a broadband connection, cable/adsl/t1, etc.<br />
<br />
This file determins how many k of data EQ will send to your client at a time. If the number on the right of your lag meeter in EQ goes over the number of K in the file, you will likely get disconnected. 5.0 = 5000, 7.0 = 7000, 9.0 = 9000.<br />
<br />
According to Verant, settings of over 9.0 are ignored and treated as 9.0, but I have seen conflicting reports of people having settings as high as 40.0 and actually recieving 30,000+ data packets during mass zonings, etc.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some of you.  =)<br />
