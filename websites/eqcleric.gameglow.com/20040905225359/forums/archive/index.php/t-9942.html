Now after this first comment I probably should have left but I stayed. When I joined the druid begin to argue with me who the better healer was but after I dropped my CH bomb she shutup pretty quick, that was my first sign second sign was the ranger stopped pulling so he could med /sigh. And finally he stopped a few pulls later to ask if ANYONE has a HP buff at that point I just disbanded and camped. The real thing that is upsetting is this isn't uncommon I seem to get these type of groups all the time. HOW can you make it to mid 40's and still know nothing about the game just boggles the mind. OK thats it i'm done ranting ::ragnoir feels much better::<br />

Why did you disband?  Just because of a couple insignificant things?<br />
<br />
The ranger stopped pulling to med - what's wrong with that?  Maybe he was using harmony to pull singles or snaring or dotting or such.  There's nothing wrong with him stopping to med for a min.<br />
<br />
Then he asked for a HP buff - you disbanded after that?  Why?  I guess I don't understand.  Did you HP buff him?  Maybe he was politely hinting that he would like a HP buff without rudely demanding it.<br />
<br />
Not sure why you got upset at these 2 situations.  I've seen far worse than that.<br />

<br />
i agree with Dalur. A ranger is most efficient with some mana up, and for the buff question, he may has been dispelled by a webmistress or something...if you had buffed him before...<br />
<br />
Maybe i missed something...</div></div><hr />

If you had valor on him, he might not have realized its the cleric equivalent. Or perhaps he was just hinting that he could use a symbol.</div></div><hr />

I don't know who casts what good buffs for me on me at 55.  He probably just wanted all the HP buffs he could get.  All I know about buffs are the ones I give and that enchies giveme clarity.  I should know more but I don't.  And there are a lot of people who don't know who gives what so I would just relax, and any druid that says he is a better healer is just ****ing with you or stupid.  Just ignore them<br />
