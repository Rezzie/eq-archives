One thing I absolutely hate is when you are medding or standing around and chatting with fellow players, and someone walks right in front of you, stops,as asks &quot;Could someone heal me plz?&quot;, when it's blatantly obvious you are the only healer nearby.<br />

It does not seem to bother them when said cleric(s) are someplace in Kunark [quite often the library of Kaesora] and they died in SK. Grr.<br />
Fortunately I've still got 8 more levels until I have to deal with the twerps.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
