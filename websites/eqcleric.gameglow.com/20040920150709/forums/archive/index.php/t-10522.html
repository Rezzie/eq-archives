I have not been there and was wondering if it was worth the boat trip<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />

I have noticed as of late, that a lot of people PL their friends in Unrest.. pull the house down on themselves, and have a uber character healing and buffing them from behind.. so getting spawn can become hard to do....<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong, I love unrest.. it is especially great for getting from level 12-16 on yard trash.. heheh<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other places that are good xp at 20 are Mistmoore Castle, South Karana (aviaks), Lake Rathe (aviaks, gnolls, skellies), Oasis (crocs, some orcs), High Pass Hold (gnolls, orcs), Warrens (fairly deep in), Upper Guk.<br />
<br />
That should keep you busy for awhile  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Maybe just me (and I know its not) but I DISPISE that place-it's turned me off to Kunark since then-not even KC&amp;Seb has been able to lure me back for long, though Chardok has my attention now. Go to the aviaks-the people here tend to be better groupers because all the twinks head to LoIO, so you get people that have actually spent time learning their class rather than spending 20 levels with a high-level druid/cleric/shaman friend standing behind them keeping them alive. Besides, you get to make lots of chicken jokes and them undead cyclops are FUNNY looking...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">piikaa</div><div class="date">01-30-2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went from Oasis to LOIO at 18, and at 27, started heading over into Frontier Mountains.  LOIO is a good place for a Cleric, plenty of undead and groups are easy to find if you are a healer.  You can also bind in the zone, or in Friona Vie.  Just watch out for that run between town and the LOIO zone, the Drachnids are pretty tough.<br />
