</FONT><HR>I got my cleric to 50 in a little over 16 days. Honestly, I was just as suprised as my friends about it too, especially considering it took me 18 days (I think thats right) to get my necro to 50. I also have a 35 druid with 39 days played, a 14 paly with 12 days, and a 32 monk with 12 days.<P>My cleric was born in November 2000. My paly was my first char (born March 1999), then the druid, monk, necro, cleric. If you notice the pattern, the number of days played per level per character gets shorter. I can level any character up in a much shorter time period because I've already done it. I know where to hunt and what to kill to get to 50. I also contribute alot of this to there not being an over-crowding situation like it use to be and many more areas to hunt. In May of 1999 my druid was limited on what he could hunt, but now, there are so many places its unreal.<P>------------------<BR>Kregar, 50 Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Allied Giants - Ayonae Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Kregar (edited 03-16-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am so glad to see someone else is baffled by this rapid leveling.  I've been playing EQ since early 2000 (mind you I took a 6 month hiatus).  I have a 27th lvl warrior and Celaeno is 21st lvl.  I play on The Nameless.  I just got married last month so I have even less time than before to play.  I usually play one night a week for a few hours and maybe 6 or 7 hours on the weekend when I can squeeze it in.  <P>In fact, I purchased EQ for a RL buddy last Christmas and he got hooked (shocker).  He has already surpassed me by 4 lvls.  He has a lot more time than I.<P>Anyway, I get the impression that I am missing something significant in the leveling area.  So if someone can slip me the secret under the table I would be most appreciative.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It's a bunch of different things.  My first character took me 25 days to hit 23, I think.  Today I could do that in about 2 days /played with minimal equipment.  The major factor is twinkage.  Armor makes a humongous difference for 1-20.  Knowing where and what to hunt is also a big time-saver.  People also tend to roam around with their new characters and don't bother on later ones.  I know my 25th level enchanter had seen virtually every level in the zone then, but my 44th level rogue I just PLed has really seen about five.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Keys to leveling fast:<BR>1)Leveling to 50 gets much easier with experience.<P>2)Fight in dungeons or newbie zones, get the best ZEM you can.<P>3)Group, the new grouping bonus factors combined with the ZEMs make it so much easier now.<P>Places to group with high ZEM's include Kerra, LOIO, SolA, Kaesora, and The Hole.<P>I found that running a cleric and warrior duo I can get a level in 5hrs from 20 on. That's 150hrs, count 30+ hell levels twice for 170hrs. Add 30hrs for travel/misc. and you got 20-50 in 8 days /played.<P>I have little doubt that a balanced 6 person veteran group starting out on a new server could all go from 0-51 in one month.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

If I took out quests, uneccessary travel, every helping anyone out... honestly, I'm sure I could have cut that almost in half.<P>There's a big difference between going somewhere and "grouping" and going somewhere and being in a "good group".  A good group will have very little downtime, constant kills... very few deaths... not sit and squabble over loot for 15 minutes... <P>I feel that at most times in my life, where I went on an "xp grind" I've leveled just as fast as other characters.

Thats just plain nuts. I agree there is no way you can "solo" a cleric faster than a necro or druid. What I was saying is if you just level (grouping) you CAN level a cleric pretty fast. I was on the "soloing is better" back when I was playing my necro. Then when I started playing my cleric I saw the exp that could be gained in a balanced group pulling non-stop blue mobs. It is amazing, I know, thats why I say it shocked me too. But I did pay for the strictly leveling in equipment.... I'm still wearing a thick leather apron and savants cap at 50. LOL!<P>Leveling fast or leveling slow, neither is bad, its personal preference. I wanted to get to 50 more than I wanted the loot, so thats what I did. Some want the loot more than they want level 50. Some just want to have fun and don't care what loot/level they are. I had fun leveling to 50, and so far I'm having fun just kicking back, doing raids, working on the Velious quest, etc. NOW I'm not in a hurry.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Kregar, 50 Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Allied Giants - Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Getting to 50 fast doesn't necissarily mean you were powerleveled, it can be done, in groups, you just have to be selective.  Also, it helps if you have a friend or two who are playing melee characters that you can group with regularly.  Groups of 2 or 3 are the best exp.<P>I hit 50 in 14 days or so, and I'm now level 55 with 36 days played or so.

Groups of 6 tend to be really slow.  If you are just playing to level, you have to be very careful to keep your skills up, especially at early levels.  You also have to watch things as you start getting high.  Groups in Sebilis are way different that a group in an outdoor zone.  For me, I have a 56 druid, so I knew when I started my cleric what to expect.  If you are just starting a cleric as your first character, or first character to get to a high level, I recommend hunting away from outdoor zones whenever possible, though they may be better exp.<P>Kampf.<BR>55 Dwarf Cleric.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, I screwed around alot in the lower levels, but here was my level/zone breakdown:<P>1-5 Freeport. Arguably the BEST newbie zone for dwarves, elves, half-elves and humans. No need to zone out to the newbie zone like in RiverVale or Butcherblock or Steamfont. No need to wander around a huge newbie zone looking for stuff either. Everything is right there and in quantity. Qeynos is similar. Solo of course.<P>5-8 East Commons/North Ro. Solo.<P>8-15 BlackBurrow. What can I say? I had fun there. I found Derv/Orc camps to be dismally boring. Started grouping here.<P>15-18 I wandered alot. Spent some time in Najena, Lavastorm, West Commons, Upper Guk, wherever I felt like going. Groups mostly.<P>18-24 Highpass Hold, Gnoll side, Solo. Never cared for the orc side. On the gnoll side, no one "helped" you unless you asked for it. No kill stealing. No FFA (Except named gnolls of course). Sold a few PGT's and CDS's to buy a Staff of Observor's and other goodies.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>24-35 Unrest. Groups mostly, some solo. 30-35 was almost exclusively in the ghost room or tower. I would solo some until a spot opened in one of those 2 rooms.<P>35-41 was mostly Lower Guk. All grouped.<P>41-50 was split between soloing specs in oasis, soloing specs in Feerrot, Grouping in Lower Guk and Grouping in Sol B. I was maxed in exp in 50 the day Kunark came out. I spent alot of time in the later stages of this period in Hate and Fear, but didn't get much if any exp.<P>51-52 was done almost exclusivly in Karnors Castle. Then I lost it all in that busted Fear raid. Regained 50 soloing specs in oasis, 50-51 was in a bug group in Solb. And the 3 yellow bubs I have in 51 have been from Karnors again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

But the point, Kannayyan, is that you don't start the game with two 50+ characters, or knowing "where to hunt."  Most people start out pretty clueluess about efficient hunting, compared to what you know after leveling one character up to 50+.<P>If you're comparing a necro who's a player's first character with a cleric started much later (and probably twinked somewhat) it would not be surprisng at all to see the cleric level much faster.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><BR>     Stonecrusher is my primary character, born on June 6, 1999.  I have'nt looked lately at time played but he is 36.  I dont really need to wonder how everybody else passed me up, I have a bad case of MCD (multiple character disorder).  I have a barb warrior (actually my first character) who finally last week made level 21, an erudite magician who just made 19, a halfling druid (19), a barb shaman(8), a half elf thief (dunno), an Iksar warrior (12), an erudite necro (4), a human! ranger (9), an ogre SK (4), a dwarven paladin (4), another dwarven cleric (12), a dark elf magician (3), a half elfe bard (6), and a partrige in a pear tree (15)!  Plus, on top of all that I only play about 5 hours a week....total.<P>     On top of that I sort of took about six months off, in little bits, week at a time here, a month there.  I think if I had really concentrated on my cleric the whole time I would be in the upper forties, maybe.  Of course I would be insane, divorced, and jobless too.  The game is what you make it, you get out what you put in....untill Verant releases the next patch, then you find out that what you get out is nothing like what you put in.  But that is another story.<P><P>------------------<BR>Stonecrusher Medicus<BR>Vertically challenged Cleric of Brell<BR>Rodcet Nife server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>When people talk of rapid leveling and such, I think that they are usually missing the point.  Let me explain.<P>First off, my cleric is level 53, and my days played is in the high 80's.  The VAST majority of that time was spent horribly unproductively though (from an xp gaining perspective anyway).  Most of those days were spent wandering around trying out new places, acquiring loot (hunting and trading and questing), looking for groups or grinding in bad groups,  killing time, talking with peeps, waiting around on raids,  or just afk.  I'd say that only a very small portion of my playing time was spent getting any REAL xp.  I've probably gotten 90% of my levels in under 15 days (i usually screw around alot, then get mad that I've been at a certain level for so long, then grind solid xp until i get sick of it).<P>Because of this, I will make the broad generalization that SOLOING IS FASTER THAN GROUPONG 97% OF THE TIME.<P>Now maybe if you have a close group of friends of appropriate classes and levels, and you can coordinate well enough to nearly always be on at the same time and play together....and are on the same mindset about where to go and what to do.....then maybe grouping is faster.  BUT this is rarely the case.  Now I know we've all been in that 'perfect' group where xp flowed like water.  Now that will NEVER happen solo, but how often are you in those groups?<P>Having said that, if you want to level rapidly its all about your mindset and playing style.  Here is the BIG secret!!!  Get ready!!<P>step one:  Find a place where you can solo blue mobs as easily as possible (the best place will be one where the spawn rate is faster than your mana regen).....then .....most importantly.....<P>step two:  STAY THERE!!!!  No leaving for any reason.  If you're a cleric, just summon food.  If not, then stock up.  just stay there till you no longer get xp.  <P>step three:  Repeat.<P>Its that simple.<P>I know for a fact that clerics can solo to 54 pretty easily, and I've heard very convincingly that we can solo to 60.  If clerics can do it, any casting class can....just faster.  All melee classes might not be able to solo to 60, but they can all solo higher than they usually get credit for (and for the time that they can solo, it will nearly always be faster than grouping).<P>Stroke</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I think you will find that a good group who barely manages to hold the shaman room in Blackburrow is just as fun as a good group taking down a dragon somewhere.<P>It's not like you can WIN this game, you have to have fun, and if you have fun leveling, then the more power to you.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Naxy Dent Cleric of Karana on Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Last I checked, I think I had over 40 days on Sonard at level 52. Created March 6, 2000. (Sad to think how much time I spent in this game).  If my memory is right, I think I hit 30 with about 20 days played.  I made a monk, got him to 23 in 5 days, and still did all my shackle quests, and did it totally solo (now working on fixing faction, so exp really slowing down, /rude HK guards).<P>Reason's my monk is leveling so much faster:<BR>Think back to your first 10 levels playing your first charactor.  You didn't know much, got lost all the time, spent a lot of time looking for that corpse when you got jumped in a new zone, endless hours hailing NPC's trying to figure out what the quest was, and who gave out quests, waiting for boats, looking for that elusive merchant that sold an item you needed (I think I spent a whole 4 hours hungry and thirsty trying to find out where to buy food in Kelethin when I got level 4 and did not get newbie food when I died), hours apon hours running around exploring new zones, sitting at a zone line looking for a group, working on trade skills, ect ect ect.  Take all this out (never did any of this with monk) and you cut down ALOT of time.  Don't have to be powerleveled to level quickly.  You just know the game, where to hunt, and how to play effectively (what you can kill for fast exp).  Other factors include little things like I am sure when you make an alt, you have a lot more idea of what stats to put points in (was totally clueless when I made Sonard), you know what equipment to put on (and can afford it), and know where to find info about your class to make the most of your playing time (learning curve a lot less).<P>BTW, I did not 'uber twink' my monk.  I did get a pair of fighting batons from a guild member as a trade for an advisor robe, and got him 2 peices of cresent armor from Dalnir's when he was 14, and gave him +str jewelry and an exe hood (total value of equip at level 23: 1.8k approx.  If it was my first char, I am sure I could have gotten him same equip alone except for cresent for another 7 levels).<P>Other bonuses that make alt's level faster is you never need a pickup group (twinks tend to hunt with twinks of friends), and you will probably never need to take a boat, as by this time you probably know enough druids/wizards that you can get a port for your twink when you need it.  You also tend not to spend time on trade skills on alts.<P>Respective twinks will take less and less time as far as I have seen.  And if you are making a twink because you are level 60 and your guild needs a certain key class,  you can level this char at a phenominal rate.<P>I personally know of a level 60 necro in a large guild on my server who made a chanter.  At level 4 he was constantly begged for clarity since he had the equipment better than most level 50 chanters.  He also had a pet druid/chanter to Powerlevel him all the way to 60.  I think he did got level 50 in something like 10 days played, but it was a while ago so I can't remember exactly what it was, but that is pretty close.  I know it was insane.<P>Tactic to PL lowbies insanely fast:  Go to newbie dungeon like runneye that is pretty much deserted, Rune and 8 pt DS and run around and agro reds till you get 10 beating on ya and sit back and rake in exp.  Go to next dungeon and repeat till they start to yellow out on ya.  Of course you have to stop every few levels and get skills back up so you don't hit level 50 with alteration at 10 since you never cast many spells.  But skills like offence, defence, block ect go up if you are hitting mobs while being attacked.  Especially defence.<P>So, while it's not impossible to get to high levels extremely fast, you wouldn't do it with your main char. Even if I was into powerleveling, I would never powerlevel a genuine n00b like that since he would be for all intents and purposes, an Ebay char.  But if you got a char or 2 to level 50, and am not taking away mobs from real newbies (IE, fighting in deserted places), I don't see the harm.<p>[This message has been edited by Sonard (edited 03-18-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think when i last looked at the played versus level thing i had hit about 34 ish with 6 days played, no powerlevelling some solo but mainly pickup groups.<P>Certainly at higher levels a cleric in good groups will outlevel a solo necro.<P>Depends on how you play your characters, if you play to level (as my cleric has been) then you dont take time out for anything bar xp. I play/played quite a few toons and now only really play 5 (shaman, enchanter, necro, cleric and mage). My shaman and enchanter actually have quite a few hours on them as i will quest/farm etc with them for fun.<P>Lvl 45 is a newbie in terms of the higher level 50 game esp as quite a few people will have multiple 50+ toons. Personally i think people that adopt this attitude are too arrogant.<P>------------------<BR>Fryg 55 Beguiler<BR>Tryg 54 Mystic<BR>Cryg 44 Necromancer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I don't know the exact number of days I have played Dusklar, but it is a bunch.., as he was around not to long after the game was introduced.. , and he isn't level 60 yet.. btw all the rumors about 59 are true.. it stinks.... <BR>The main reason I think that any character can move up so fast in levels now is a combination of things.. firstly knowing where to hunt, what to do, what to attempt solo or in group has to speed up the leveling process. Heck how many times did you die in the first few levels just figuring out how to get back to those guards to save you ???   <BR>The second reason for skyrocketing levels is twinkage.. I still have alot of my quest armor in the bank, for example, and if I ever would start another cleric he would immediately inherit a pretty good batch of equipment.. Plus he would have help from others in my guild, and my main.. so leveling would definately be faster..When I started playing everyone was a newbie.. :  )   <BR>  I think the person who said up above is it isn't how fast you level, but if you are having fun..and I definately have had my share of laughs throughout my eq career, and done some dumb things that caused major bubble decreases.. but it was exciting, new, and alot more dangerous back in those days, as no one knew of the perils we would come across..
