<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-29-2000, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well first trip to hate - woot.  Won the roll on EM legs but another cleirc needed them to complete set of EM she wanted (as in not the bracers) so I passed hehe (the guild liked that heh ) so I got the next armour drop (another person won a shield).  It had the vambracers and I am now on me way to being a barney dorf :&gt;<br />
<br />
Anyhow we had 2 amazing monks chain pulling stuff splitting maestro's room of 3 golems 1 cleric into 2 golems, 1 golem and cleric and then maestro himself.<br />
<br />
Anyhow we buff up start to fight him and slowly all the clerics ran out of mana.  The tanks started to die and bang that was it.  We got the maestro down till he was running away but he ae life tapped back enough to start fighting :&lt;<br />
<br />
So the question is how do you do him with 30 people all around 50-53.  We were doing god type buffing for round 2 when stupid verant decided to kill the servers :&lt;  So we had to evac and call it a day.<br />
<br />
GRR that cost my guild 6 or more hate stones.  Anyhow apart from getting taken out my maestro we owned hate :&gt; was pretty easy heh.<br />
<br />
Do we need more tanks for maestro? or does that just feed him more hps? do we need to get our magic resistance higher than 150? we all had well over 100.  Any info would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burro</div><div class="date">07-29-2000, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killing Maestro is alot of time based on how much he decides to life tap. We just threw on full cleric buffs (hp/ac buff, ac buff and symbol) and shaman buffs before the fight. Then we pull him into the first banshee house in the SW corner and pin him in the corner of the house so he doesn't fly around smacking all the casters and proceed to beat the crap out of him. Our tank armament consisted of something near 3 warriors, 3 rangers, paladin or 2, 1 bard, 3 mage pets, and a charmed creature (they help alot).</div></div><hr />

Strut over to maestro root/nuke nice easy solo mob for someone like myself.  Could even melee him if I had to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cael</div><div class="date">07-30-2000, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We fight him in the cleric house.   The tanks fight him at the anvil, and all the casters (including clerics) stay in the little alcove.   Tanks fight him till he's about half, then the casters rush in and nuke like mad.    <br />
<br />
If everyone is within the range of his AE, he will take forever to kill.   You want the least number of people as possible being exposed.<br />

Make sure no casters agro him, as that will drag him into the caster/healer area, which should be out of the ae range.  When he gets down to 40% or even a bit lower the casters rush in and nuke as fast as they can.  Last time we did this we had no deaths, and rarely do we lose more than 2 or 3 if things go well.<br />
<br />
The main thing to remember is to keep as few people in the ae life tap range as you can.  He can be nasty if he starts healing as fast as your hurting him because he life taps the casters.<br />
<br />
Get necros to mana feed clerics, and make sure all healers have a rod at the start of the fight, this should give your tanks enough healing to get mystro low enough that the castes can hit him.<br />

I have killed Mae in several areas and it didnt make a differnece.  What did matter, is to tell people that are not meleeing to stay the hell away from him.  Also having a couple of wizards and monks also seem to help alot.  I have only been on one raid that failed to kill Mae. The basterd was duel wielding Six notes.  We were also missing wizards and monks on this raid as well.<br />

I have to agree Burro - it depends on his life tap. Like this weekend when we killed  maestro - I didn't see him life tap that much - and he died quick. Now in long drawn out fights - He is almost impossiable to kill as he will grind out your tanks with that life tap.<br />
<br />
So here tactic - kill him quick - very quick.<br />

Tell you why in a sec.  Tanks should be the only ones in melee true, and nukers nuke the heck out of him when he hits half, but the key is this.... everyone that has nullify magic or another form of dispell, cast it on him.<br />
He wastes half his time trying to rebuff instead of AE lifetaping.  :-)<br />

Same thing - only melee should be in AE range, and get him down as quickly as possible. There's a very narrow range for healers where you are out of his reach but can still heal your tanks, but nukers should have a wider leeway. Also I don't know how true this is, but a bard in our group who is very experienced in Hate swore that his AE is not symmetrical. He said if he gets behind the Maestro to fight, he hardly takes damage from the lifetap. I'm skeptical, but I party with this guy often and know very well how fast he dies...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif and amazingly I never had to heal him in that fight. So spread your tanklets around a bit, it can't hurt.<br />

Guess we had the right make up of classes that day.  Also went on to kill Inno with the same crew.  We rocked that night because it only took 4 hours to get to Inno.<br />

<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />

If you see him come out with two weapons, expect a very tough fight.  Quad 205's is just nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunik</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was up in hate for 8 hours on Sunday and we finished the night with his death.  The way this was done is as follows:<br />
<br />
Total group 24 ppl<br />
<br />
Monks pulled Golems and Clerics as needed until only &quot;Da Man&quot; was left.  At this point the groups reformed as follows:<br />
<br />
1.  5 tanks and one bard formed into the Melee group.<br />
<br />
2.  5 clerics and one bard formed into the healing group.<br />
<br />
3.  Everyone else grouped and took seats in the bleachers.  <br />
<br />
Each cleric was assigned one tank and all we were suppose to do was cast CHeals on that one person.  We stood as far away as possible.  The tanks melee'd &quot;Da Man&quot; until he was at around 20% health at that point all the casters stepped into range and began nuking.  We only had one causalty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corii Se'Lune</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The BEST Maestro slaying I had ever witnessed was when we had 4 bards that worked together to sing their AE dot songs at the same time. He went down amazingly fast.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Always make sure everyone is buffed with group resist magic and as MUCH magic resist gear as possible. It DOES make a huge difference in how much damage his lifetap does.<br />
<br />
Have all the tanks meleeing him in a spot away from casters and healers... once he is at about 30-40% health, casters should nuke the heck out of him.<br />
<br />
Worst Maestro was sitting and meditating at 80% health, he got pulled on accident and made a beeline for me. He was dual wielding and got quad attack +lifetaps and bash off on me.. I died before I even stood up.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
