<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talura cwnZeylon</div><div class="date">03-13-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which expansions?<br />
In Norrath, there is lower guk (deeper frogs, near/past the safe hall), sol b (again, deeper), entry area of the hole if it's free.<br />
Kunark, you could probably do Sebilis, Karnor's Trainstation, I hear Chardok is good xp (never been), I think there are several outdoors zones that would work as well.<br />
Velious...Siren's grotto? (been once) or Cobalt scar come to mind immediately. Velks is popular also.<br />
Luclin, I'm just now beginning to explore so no recommendations there. The gray looked promising (well, uh, sort of...my 45 rog got pwned running from Seru to Twilight), just bring EB items. Mons Lethalis I think is good to the 50's (just one hop south from Gray). Can probably hang in the 40ish zones for cheap-n-easy xp (Twilight sea, Dawnshroud mtns, not sure where else).<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to go to www.eqatlas.com (http://www.eqatlas.com)  and look at the zone level guide there. (If they still have it.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sollace</div><div class="date">05-28-2002, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent place for a cleric to solo up until level 56:<br />
<br />
Undead Ruins just south of Nexus in Dread Lands.  There are skeletons in one pyramid that can be single pulled with an undead dot - I use sermon of the righteous (longer range) - back up, root, then continue dotting, rerooting.<br />
<br />
Two undead dots<br />
Undead Nukes<br />
Root<br />
<br />
If two are pulled you can fear one and it stays away a L-O-N-G time.<br />
<br />
Best thing about this place is safe medding.  Well, that and close access to the Nexus portal to go sell.<br />
<br />
Skeletons drop PP and pages / words.  They never have weapons.<br />
<br />
There are wandering skeletons around that complex, so if you use the Iskar seller be careful.<br />
<br />
Second favorite place to solo undead at 51/52 is in Burning Woods.  The ugly apes are undead as are the skeletons.  Watch mobs and find a spot where you can safely med.  I found one in sight of the giant fort.<br />
<br />
Nice thing about this place is easy access to Zordak sitings in Skyfire and guild groups in Chardok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">05-31-2002, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chardok should be doable for you.<br />
And there is always a shot at a Sarnak Battle Shield or one of those Dizok rings. Bring your own group or take your chance, but you could be in for some time doing nothing but sitting at zone waiting.<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of Lower Guk. You should be able to get into a Frenzy group. XP there should be pretty nice if you aren't in a group with scared (or worse, foolish) twinks comming into a dungeon for the first time in their life  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
SolB. I grouped with a monk there doing lava duct crawlers. He was soloing, but didn't mind the buffs and CH's I could offer him, so we decided to team up. <br />
<br />
Velks: Nice zone with decent xp, but stay out in primetime. That zone is plain horrible at primetime. Average lifespan of a spider is roughly 15 seconds. Too many people and too few mobs. BORING!<br />
<br />
The Hole: Entrance area is pretty good xp, but bring your own group there.<br />
<br />
Karnors: *shiver* uhm well...stay out of right/left moat groups. Trains en masse and fighting over pulls isn't my idea of fun. Captain offer some more fun, or a hands group. KC is a matter of opinion, I don't like it much but it's pretty easy to get a group and always quite a few people around there.<br />
<br />
Sebilis: FUN zone, nice loot but frogs don't forgive mistakes  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Some nights it can be very tough to get into a group though. Other times I get several offers when going LFG there. But I would check it out for sure. Try just before US prime time.</div></div><hr />
