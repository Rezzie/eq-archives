<br />
I was wondering if anyone has experience with the Shei<br />
in AR?<br />
<br />
I know quite a bit about it but have two specific questions, <br />
one of which I was hoping you clerics may be able to answer.<br />
<br />
The room in which you fight the Shei has a manadrain<br />
trap of sorts. Seems maybe a little like the Arry dot. I have<br />
heard its possible to avoid this dot, for the CH clerics<br />
at least. Any advice?<br />
<br />
Lastly, is the REAL shei supposed to spawn any guards?<br />
Or are the only adds the real shei responsible for , those<br />
summoned by the DT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't think it's just DT's that will get you adds.  I think that any time a person dies, for whatever reason in that room/area, you'll get an add.  So if stuff starts to go bad, it can get out of hand very very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chrome100</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand that. It seemed when we first aggroed the<br />
real shei (non merchant) he insta spawned 4 extra mobs<br />
as WELL as the first DT mob!<br />
<br />
Looked similar to the mobs the merchant first summoned.<br />
Was wondering if this was working as intended.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />

I've only been to 3 or so of my guilds Shei attempts (2 loses and 1 win) and don't recall the start of the fights really, or how much stuff was killed clearing the room before and after the real shei had spawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cland</div><div class="date">08-15-2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remeber when we ddi our only attempt at him, it seemed we could never get the guards to stop spawning, we'd clear the guards in his room, the monk would agro and bam new mobs. <br />
<br />
So maybe he does, I think we tried leaving one of the guards alive but been so long I don't remember if it worked or not :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/   Shei has 4 guard in room these are on a  2 - 4 minute timer so killing these guards is useless you need to have a bard kite them around outside room for the duration of the fight.<br />
<br />
2/   Shei DT means a corpse for each corpse in the room a SK guard will spawn  and Shei DT every 5 minutes so you need to have enough melee/nuke power to burn the guards within 4 minutes so that you have time to regroup for next guard spawn.<br />
<br />
3/   You need to have constant damage output on shei at all times and there needs to be some form of agro control (AE Taunt is good) when you MT gets DT'd cause he will.<br />
<br />
4/   You need to have a person elected to rez the dead MT's asap so a person also should be elected to drag the corpse for the rez.<br />
<br />
5/   You need a team of Rez/Buffers only and a Team of Healers for MT who are fighting shei.<br />
<br />
6/    You need the backup healers to cover the SK guard healing.<br />
<br />
And to be honest knowing all this we have still been unable to take shei out ever since verant patched her she has become VERY hard to kill. Personally I think the Arch Lich and HP in SSRA are easier kills than this one.<br />

1) The 4 spawns are NOT on a 2-4 minute time. We definalty always just kill them, never kite. I believe they are a triggered spawn each time Shei ( both versions ) goes from unaggrod mode to aggro. So once you aggro her, do not have the person die / fd before someone else is on aggro too.  No need to kite them, just dont lose aggro on Shei while you kill them ... no problem, since Shei is rooted anyway and wont come after you while you kill the set that will spawn when you aggro the 2nd Shei. And dont memblur her :p<br />
<br />
2) Not sure on the DT timer, seemed to be lower then 5 minutes, more like 2 or 3, but didnt really time it. However, the number of mobs that spawn has nothing to do with number of corpses, you will get one spawn per PC that gets killed by Shei. <br />
<br />
Personally, i cant stand the Shei encounter... the way to her is full with those stupid traps, and DTing mobs are just plain annoying. Luckily my guild ( same guild as Dalain, even if he wont know me under this name .:p ) doesnt have it very high on priority list ...</div></div><hr />
