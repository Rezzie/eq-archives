<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bremmin</div><div class="date">02-28-2000, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This really pissed me off. A lv 40 Cleric walked up to me at the wizard spires in Greater Faydark and complemented me on my quest arms. He then offered me 500pp for them. I told him there was no way I would sell them for 500pp. I am only level 27, and I consider all four of the pieces I have to be priceless (well, the boots I would sell, but not the other three). He doesn't seem to understand the amount of effort it takes for a lv 27 cleric to kill Gull Skytalon post-patch, for instance. I tell him I don't want to do the deal, and then he pleads with me, telling me that with 500pp I could and should buy a platinum armband instead, because they look better!!! on dwarves and because he has 200 wisdom. As if the fact that some panzy twink High Elf cleric has 200 wis is a big deal, because he probably started up in the 120s. I have 140 wis right now, and I started at base of 93. Verant says in the book that Wisdom is not the only attribute of primary importance to Clerics. I also put some of my points into intelligence, so my skills would go up faster? and I am proud of the fact that I have raised my wisdom by 47 points at lv 27. <br />
<br />
After telling him that I think that's nice, and that since he's lv 40 he should go get the cleric arms himself, he tells me I'm stupid s'more and continues to insult me. So I tell him that he's the one being stupid, by offering me 500pp for cleric quest arms that take forever to get and are worth more to me than that, when he could go get his own for 105pp, 5gp, the cost of the plat bar and two kiola nuts. I tell him that he's now on ignore, nohelp, and nogroup, and ignore him.<br />
<br />
So he looks at my guild tag, because I do not go anon, just roleplay, and then tells a guild member in the zone that I am stupid for not wanting 200 wis (I do want 200wis. I do not care about the platinum armband, however. I would rather wear plate and have lower wis than wear some leather looking junk, or stuff that has no graphics at all.) and that I need to get a brain. So in effect, he pissed off my entire guild. I am wondering how these people get to lv 40, the ones who think they can just buy everything. Does anyone know? Maybe they group with PLing druids?<br />

Keep working on the quests a full suit(less shield) looks great although constantly being inspected does get annoying.<br />
<br />
Regarding 200 wis while it is good to have more wisdom i find a balance between AC and Wis to be preferable.My wis is now at 180,as long as i can maintain this i will try to get more AC.<br />

You think you get inspected now? Try a full suit with the shield! I get more questions about the glowing shield than anything else...<br />

I think you did right at putting that guy on ignore. I would.<br />
<br />
Some people offer to buy my armor or trade for it. I've done two trades to date, and both were for equipment for Skyestorm, who isn't very well equiped at all for a druid of her level, and she's doing all she can to help keep me to a point where I'm not dropping dead trying to keep her and my group alive...<br />
<br />
If it weren't for getting her some decent items once in awhile, I wouldn't trade it at all.</div></div><hr />

I had people trying to buy my equipment right off my back.  Typically, if you're wearing it, it's not for sale.  Some idiots don't seem to get that.<br />
<br />
Jeez what a twerp.<br />
<br />
Oh, and speaking of twinks..<br />
Saw a 22nd level cleric yesterday (High elf, of course) with more mithril than you can shake a stick at.  How sweet.  I'm 45th and she had nicer stuff than I do.<br />
<br />
No offense to you high elves and all - just that well.. dangit you're so common.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
