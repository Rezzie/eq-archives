What sadistic moron designs a dungeon where you actually have to fall down pits with no idea of how to get back up? So now i have a guild member's corpse somewhere down there and nobody has any idea how to get it...<br />
<br />
Hmmm<br />

Or  if there area is not too dangerous have a cleric DA, jump, resurrect and gate (if the unfortunate dead is a caster and can gate).<br />

Just my 2 cp. I really have never even been near the area.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Your friend didn't keep the arrow going forward to run onto the other ramp, so no problem.  Take 5 of your friends, consisting of 1 chanter, 3 tanks (warrior, 2 rogues works nicely, though sub a bard out if possible for nice speedy mana), and 1 nuker and make sure they all know the keep running to get to the landing.  Go forward until you get to a room with a broken floor.  Standing there will agro the 1 spider below (no problem, need to clear it anyhow).  While standing there you will note that across the broken floor there is a pathway (in the pit) that is the path to the exit! Remember that!<br />
<br />
Now, fall down into the pit from the broken floor room, and look to your right.  Thats the path to where your friends broken body is, and where several very nice things drop =)<br />
<br />
Simply follow the path, eradicating everything in your way, and you'll finally come to a room with several doors, and your friends corpse.  CAREFUL!  One of these doors hides a Spider thats pretty difficult for most, so your party will need to be prepared.  A group of 43-48's won't have much of a problem, but be warned that he likes to poison, so have the cure handy.  He drops some nice stuff, as do the spiders in the surrounding area, as they have high chances of dropping that shammy/cleric only +wis shield that is ULTRA rare.<br />
<br />
Clear the room, rez your friend, battle or gate out, and you're done!<br />
<br />
Now, if you found THAT entertaining, you should meet the head honcho of the place =)<br />

<br />
There's a nice map at &lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Kaesora_Illandra.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; location. <br />
<br />
Your friend is most likely at 8 or near it at this map. I suggest dropping down at A, go right to 1, right again there then left to J and drop down. Turn around there and go back to 6, go right and right again at 7. :-)<br />
<br />
Personally, I know Kaesora fairly well now after camping that fang thing for 30 hours (motsly to help guildbuddies), library for maybe 6 hours total, and those $#)(%&amp;^*() spiders for 50 hours.<br />
