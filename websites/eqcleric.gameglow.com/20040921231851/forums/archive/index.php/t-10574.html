There should be a few people running around up there and most of them know the value of a cleric.  The mobs have fast spawn rates and 2 or 3 groups could pull non-stop, 4 would be getting crowded though.<br />
<br />
Note that all mobs up there assist each other, but you will not be kos to the trogs which makes them easier to pull.  Also a couple of named mobs spawn here with decent drops for the level.</div></div><hr />

Go to Marus Seru.  Even better than Netherbian I think.  Lots more mobs to choose from.  Pretty good xp and more people to group with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thotam</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Marus shure has tons of mobs but be prepared for add,add,add,add on one pull :)<br />
<br />
Lightcrawlers run at sow speed or maybe even faster, zelniaks has a fairly large aggro range, basically get in casting range and it will aggro.<br />
<br />
Fought in a group for like 3 hours and had one sk dying at the end, think the bard pulled like 4 maybe 5 mobs then i think about 2 more added, and i was at below 10% mana(1 healing needs about 8%) still was fun and everyone put up a good fight.<br />
<br />
Netherbian can be okey to i guess at least mobs(trogs) drop money, no cash in marus but hides,and research stuff, might try that one to gain the last half of 28</div></div><hr />
