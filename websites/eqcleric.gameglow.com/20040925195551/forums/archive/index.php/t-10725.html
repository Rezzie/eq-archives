<br />
Where is a good, fast, safe place to gain exp in a group, in Kunark. <br />
<br />
I might just have to go back to guk. Which is frightening me, heh.<br />

The mobs hit too hard and have too many hitpoints for the level they are. It could be that I haven't found the right spot, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viscera</div><div class="date">05-04-2000, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Kunark sucks for grouping experience. However, at the undead ruins in Dreadlands, I am able to solo, and I am roughly estimating that I get twice as much experience soloing, as opposed to grouping.<br />
<br />
The way I figure it, I can kill one blue MOB every 10min or so (give or take). In a group of 4-6, I would have to kill from 4-6 MOB's in the same time period. That is basically impossible. It often takes 1-2min just to kill a single MOB (in Burning Woods and Karnor's for example). For getting experience, solo is the way to go. Course, I recommend picking up a good book.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness L52 goes a lot quicker than 51.<br />

I think I managed this once since reaching the new continant.<br />
<br />
Quite a few people seem to be noticing this. To extent that some posts from melee classes are suggesting a difficulty getting healers to group with becouse there all soloing.</div></div><hr />
