<br />
We've always had some cross server interest in our guild but until now we haven't really been able to accomodate it very well. But, with the new server transfer with gear we are going to give it a shot. We're looking for 1-2 good clerics who like to raid. We're a CST based guild which makes it workable for basically anyone in the U.S. as far as time zone goes. Anyone who might be interested should check out our news update at http://arete.iambored.com and then follow the link to the recruiting page. Any questions can be emailed to areteofficer@sbcglobal.net or cross server tells to eci.Novin or eci.Dagny.<br />

Those running from bad reps, please don't waste our time.<br />
<br />
Thanks and good luck to you all.</div></div><hr />
