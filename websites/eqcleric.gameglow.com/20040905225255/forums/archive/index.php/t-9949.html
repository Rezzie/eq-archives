<br />
First.. you know those short guys in the game that worship Brell? Like me? Singular, its called a dwarf, and plural, its called dwarves. If you spell it dwarfs, that's all right.. but it is NOT dorf or dorfs!<br />
<br />
I am not a Dorf!<br />
<br />
Second.. I don't understand the Anti-druid bias by many on this board (and other boards). I do not judge a player by their race. I'm glad I don't.. some of my best friends are druids. I've been helped by druids more times then I can count. And not just ports... but I've had help with quests, including my Testament of Vanear, cleric quest gaunts, and a GM quest. More then once, I've ran into a druid that refused to accept my port donation.<br />
<br />
Are many druids jerks? Oh yeah.. I've met a few. Are all druids jerks? Nope! And, not all jerks are druids either. I've come across just as many rude paladins and idiot monks and inconsiderate warriors as I have bad druids. I'm probably very lucky when it comes to druids.. but I know you shouldn't judge someone by their class.<br />
<br />
Third.. and this has nothing to do with Everquest. <br />
<br />
Why don't people keep their rented DVDs in good shape? I rented two DVDs today.. and both of them were filled with scratches. It took 3 hours to watch a 99 minute movie because the DVD kept skipping around. It is not that hard to prevent scratching your DVD! Just because you don't own it doesn't mean its not your responsiblity to take good care of it!<br />

<br />
Basically ALOT of druids were kiteing &quot;everywhere&quot;. Thru your group, around your group, circling your group. I think you begin to get the idea.<br />
<br />
If you talk to basically &quot;anyone&quot; who's been around since beta you'll find out that everyone has been killed, group wiped out, or just basically trained repeatidly by druids...<br />
<br />
Druids basically picked up a very bad rep for this. While you can't really say that all druids do this many people just got sick of dieing to people who did these kind of things to them.<br />
<br />
Also add to this that alot of druids lacked group skills and when they did group didn't group very well. <br />
<br />
Now, we've all been in groups were having a druid along (snare, backup healer) really helps. And there are alot of really good druids in the game. But most people just won't forget the constant trains these people made.<br />
<br />
Druid issues are really things of the past now. The biggest train issues now are due to the &quot;new up and coming 60's crowd&quot; who leveled up in the outdoor zones and never went into dungeons until they were 60.<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are the people you need to fear.&quot;<br />

<br />
I know I accedently had my PS2 tip over while I was playing GTA3 and it ruined my game  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
and about the dorf thing, it kinda grates at me too, but I learned to deal with it, being a 3rd of the the dwarfs in my raid group has that effect  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">12-10-2001, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DVDs definetly seem to be more sensitive to scratches then CDs.. My mom.. she treats her CDs horribly.. yet most of them still work in spite of all the scratches. A few scratches on a DVD... and the movie freezes  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Josiefuz</div><div class="date">12-10-2001, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DVD's have a lot more info packed into the same space as a CD.  Therefore a little scratch becomes a big scratch.  Also, many DVD's are double-sided, so there's no &quot;safe side&quot; to lay them on if they are outside the box.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate being called a dorf too, but I guess that's a nickname you have to live with...<br />
Better than being called a dr00d I guess.<br />
<br />
Time to go figure out some nicknames for those stocked up people who can't spell dwarf!<br />
<br />
I got quite a few druid friends, and that &quot;I hate druids&quot; trend is slowly getting old.<br />
What you should really fear is all kinds of classes who lacks indoor hunting skills (you know, the LOIL-OT-DL gang) and grouping experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malore</div><div class="date">12-11-2001, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It doesn't have to come on DVD, but would be a nice option.<br />
<br />
Not all DVDs are double sided.<br />
<br />
DVDs use a stronger laser and they focus farther into the disc so scratches shouldn't be too much worse.</div></div><hr />

I had him begging for symbol later on, mwa ha ha ha!<br />
<br />
Btw, hands room in KC can be quite fun with 2 monks, 2 shammies a tank and a cleric  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
Never thought I had to admit that. I normally keep as far away from KC as possible.</div></div><hr />
