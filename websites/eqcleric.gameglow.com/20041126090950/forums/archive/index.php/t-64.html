   Just curious how many of my fellow healers frustrated by slow levelling and buggy dungeon designs in kunark are splitting time with another character?<br />
   I'm spending probably 60% of my time playing my rogue recently.<br />
   Experience is extremely slow and after doing a lot of travelling its nice to take a break at 50+.<br />
   After 53 levels I hate to say but I'm enjoying spending more time away from my cleric. It is somewhat nice to play a night and actually see some exp gain and not have to worry about ones corpse being lost.<br />
<br />
Just curious if others are taking breaks from their clerics...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a level 28 barb warrior that I play on occasion when there aren't enough memebers of my guild on to play and I don't feel like getting into a pickup group.<br />
<br />
Generally I play my cleric 5 to 6 days out of the week and the warrior 1 or 2 days.<br />

It took weeks to get Learn to 10.  Course I know a lot more about how to play EQ now, but the Iksar Shaman just cuts through levels while my Human Cleric struggles for each bubble of exp.<br />

Recently, I have been playing him a bunch, just as a break from it all.  I don't think it is because of the slow experience in Kunark though.  It is more that I need a change of pace and a break from the res requests.  <br />

She is a level 25 dark elf and is a blast to play.  I really love being able to melee for a change.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badaf</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-Kurnak i set my 50th level cleric aside for the most part. I created a dwarf paladin and leveled him up to a decent level then join Clan Axepeak.<br />
<br />
 Clan Axepeak (an old NWN guild actually) is composed almost entirely of dwarves (there is a gnome and a halfling in the EQ ranks). We are in-character and RPing 99% of the time (even our web page/boards are RP). This was quite a change for me i must say. It brought a whole new challenge to the game for me (and so much more fun). When Kurnak came out i was fixing to hit 30 and was eager to get over there as the normal places i would be heading to would be the same-ol-same-ol. I quickly got to 38th. <br />
<br />
One thing about Clan Axepeak is leveling and aquiring items is at the bottom of the list of priorities (drinking and torsting being at the top (torst=axepeak for adventuring with clan members). This was my 4th character of 30th or better level while many of my mates were playing their one and only characters. Only one member right now is planes capable. So i found that i was outpacing my new friends. <br />
<br />
I would log on Badaf every now and then and look around for a pickup group. Went to Chardok once and had a blast. But was hard to find anything. So i made some more characters<br />
<br />
Made a wood elf bard and got him to 12th in short order. Fulling twinked in all-steel armor hes a sight to behold indeed. Hes actually fun to roleplay (and challenging). <br />
<br />
Also right at the start of RoK i made an Iskar necro to check out some of the new surroundings. Got him to 7th before i made my bard. Well, the other day, on a whim, i got him to 8th just to check out some of the next rank of spells. WOW! I was amazed at the difference. You cast this spell on you called Dark Pact and it trades your hps for mana. Well guess what? Iskar have troll-like regen naturally! So, in effect, i have constant clarity! Anyway, hes 10th now and is exploring Kurn's tower. Very fun!<br />
<br />
Last night a Clan member died and so i logged on Badaf and ressed her (yes a REAL her. Our female members play females dwarves and males play males. hehe). After receiving some hugs i decided to run Badaf over to Karnors and see whats shaking, since i havent seen it yet. <br />
<br />
First there was multiple groups in desperate need of a healer (So THIS is one of the places where everyone has been). I see many, many old friends there as well. It brought back alot of memories (mostly good but a few chumps were still around  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif). I joined a pickup group and commenced to shaking the rust of my etheral mist. Had alot of fun i must say. Big trains, close battles, etc. Well bed time rolled around and i hit my camp button. Then i stopped. I hadnt checked my exps all night (seems i dont do very often like a use to). I MIGHT be half a bubble into 51 but i didnt really care when i reflected back on the fun i had. <br />
<br />
I will probably play my 51 cleric more than i have been. Some of my clan mates can catch up to my paladin (although some seem to have caught a touch of level fever lately  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif). My first friend from Axepeak i met (Dhorwyn (cleric) in Unrest) is 30th now. PLus i can always jump on my bard or necro if i need soem exp gratification. Heck i even re-outfitted my 2 stripped warriors (27th level DE and 31st level ogre) and will probably play them some to. <br />

My DE SK is up to lvl 18 now.  I play her with my level 51 warrior friend (in his guise as a lvl 19 necro of course  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif) when we're both tired of trying to find a group or waiting on lists.<br />
<br />
It's fun to reverse the roles.  Think he's been around my cleric too long though...I've had to make my SK's incoming hotkey say &quot;Taunting Attacker Master&quot;.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Now if he'd just remember that I should be the one tanking.... <br />

Experience is somewhat normal now at 52 so I have the time now to play around rather than concentrating on getting thru that level.<br />

Well before I knew it Kenobe was 20th and I hadn't touched my ranger at all.  I still play him now and then and got him to 20, but like the role of a cleric way better  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />
<br />
Clan Axepeak is a great guild, I'm in the Praxium, another guild that came over from NWN. I met Kirby and Hopsbarly in Frontier MT, 2 of the nicest and most fearless Palys I ever grouped with.  Never heard a single &quot;heal me! heal me!&quot; all day even when things got tuff.  BTW: Do they have you all make an &quot;Aye Lad&quot; hot key  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
I really enjoy the change -- not having to med, running fast, doing DAMAGE.  Join an all-melee group, kill kill kill and have no downtime.  It's refreshing, but it's not my very top choice.<br />
<br />
Samsara is and always will be my favorite character to play.<br />
