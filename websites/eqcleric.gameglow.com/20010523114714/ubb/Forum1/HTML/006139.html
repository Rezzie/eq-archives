</FONT><HR>Yesterday, I was hanging outside the Rygorr fort in EW,(Hi Galavant!) and I was grouped with a decent group, with one exception, which I will explain in a minute.  <P>Well, 2 elites got loose and started to thrash our group.  Most of the group runs into Crystal Caverns, and I heal them along the way.  4 interrupts on DA later, and Im dead.  No biggie.  I get back to my body, and rez myself, and sit.  The bard in the group comes up to me and starts bugging me to come with her into CC. I explain that I can't run, but she keeps insisting that I go, because we will be invisible.  Fine.  She takes off, with SOW, to CC, and Im out of invis range right next to a very angry orc.  He starts whompin, and I root, gate, and come back to fort.  <P>We get back into CC, after I get a SOW, and the group leader decides we should start killing Geonids.  Fine by me.  We get to the pit, and we find out a little too late that the bard can't twist invis and levitate.  Thats right, she can't twist 2 songs.  we become visible, and everyone but me gets whomped.  I gate, again, and go back to fort, again.  After 2 unsuccessful attempts to get bodies, I give up and call on some high level friends to help us.  The whole process from start to finish takes 3 hours, and in my eyes, its mostly the bard's fault.  <P>The point of the story is that I have been playing this cleric for nearly 2 years, and I consider myself a pretty good cleric.  More and more, though, I am seeing people's alts all twinked up, but they quite simply don't have the skill to play a class correctly.  Does anyone else see this, and if so, how do you deal with it?  Theres only so much incompetency this High Elf can take. <P><BR>Llumis Atreideis<BR>True Elf of Tunare<BR>42nd level, The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I was grouped with a bard in Sebilis the other day that could only sing one song. The group I had just prior had a bard singing 3 or 4 at all times, including mana song for myself and the chanter. Frankly, if a bard can't sing their mana song and the fight songs at the same time, they aren't worth the mana I spend healing them, because the pull rate suffers.<P>(Edit) Wanted to add that when I joined my guild 30 some odd levels ago as a newbie, our guild leader was a bard and happened to be amazing. I have yet to meet another bard I consider his equal, so I always judge them against him.<p>[This message has been edited by Kahlia (edited 04-30-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Heh, I play a level 51 bard myself, and yeah, a bad bard can be a horrible thing in a group, mine is relagated to the role of mana/travelsong ho as I'm running around SoV and doing quest stuff, lol. Multiple computers and accounts is fun sometimes. =)<BR>Oh, btw, you can't twist invis with anything. Well, you can, but the bard becomes visible when he/she starts the other song and remains visible untill he/she twists the invis song back. What makes it bad is that anything that agros on the bard, also will have the rest of the group on its hate list...<P>------------------<BR>Caleal P`Terak<BR>BATTLE CLERIC of Innoruuk<BR>Cazic-Thule server<BR>Officer, Shadowed Soul</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><BR>Just a side note, not necessarily about twinks, but ..<P>With Verants additions to the exp calculations and these new "uber" zones where people don't ever have to leave for 15 levels, I think people can level too fast.  This causes people to be able to level without learning everything about their class and how to play it.<P>An Example:<BR>  I was in Permafrost yesterday with my alt trying to get a frost totem for some warrior boots.  A bard sends me a tell and wants to know if he could join us so that he can get some icy greaves.  No problem.  He was level 32 with assorted pieces of lambent and bronze.  The king room is full spawn and blue to all of us.  Well, I ask the bard to load pixie strike to try and mez the mobs and he replied that he didn't have that song.  It's one of the more powerful songs in a bards arsenal and he doesn't have it. /sigh  He wasn't a bad person.  He just didn't know his class.<P>Even before all of these exp/zone additions these people existed, but I'm starting to see more and more every day.<P>Rizena Halcyon<BR>Templar of the Mithril Tower<BR>Ayonae Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>2 things<P>1) I started a thread awhile ago asking people on tips on how o play different character classes that way when we encounter people like this we can give them advice on things to do. BUT as usual I got trounced for the idea so scratch that.<P>2) which ties in with the first, why not tell them what to do or give them ideas on what to do, maybe this person just doesn't know how to play a bard. I was in High Keep the one night and I was grouped with this woodelf warrior. EVERTHING kept agroing on the casters and the one caster was really grillin this guy. There were no other warriors in the zone high enough level to take his place so I asked him if he was taunting and he wasn't. Well everyone started grillin him even harder so I asked him what his skill in it was and he said 43, ACK! he was level 29 at the time. So instead of kickin him outa the group as I was the group leader I told him that he would be allowed to stay and we would deal with the agro but he had to work on his taunting skill and I was going to get constant updates to know where his skill was. I told him by the end of the night I wanted to see his skill at 110. Well not only did he start to taunt better but he starts taunting the mages pets in between gobbers to get his skill up even faster, by the end of the night his skill was in the 130's and he became one of the better warriors I have ever grouped with. <P>So i would suggest that instead of getting mad at these people work with them. I've worked with clerics and had to tell them what to do. Don't be a jerk about it, just say "Hey are you doing this?" and if they say no then say you want them to try it. If they start getting all lippy like they know what they are doing then start to think about ditchen the person. But this is why I had suggested idea #1 so that WE all know what we are talking about when it comes to other classes. but hey what do I know.... I've only helped in making some of the best warriors, bards, monks and rogues i've ever grouped with by giving them suggestions and working with them and now they are good friends. it's just the casters i'm not to clear on:P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>we find out a little too late that the bard can't twist invis and levitate. Thats right, she can't twist 2 songs.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Did it occur to you that invis would break once she started twisting levitate?<P>In this specific case it wasn't her fault, but simple game mechanics you failed to understand.  Start a song (even invis again) and invis breaks.  It's been like that since day 1.  No amount of skill will let a bard sub 51 twist invis with any other song and remain invis.  At 51 they get solo's song of travel which is a combined invis+levitate and other stuff.  Before that, nothing.<P>For those that don't know, there's no commands or magical hotkeys that lets a bard twist songs.  They must start a song, stop the song, start a new one (invis breaks ALWAYS), stop new one, start next, stop next, etc.  Consider it like casting a spell every three seconds.  Can you remain invis undead at 47 while continually refreshing everyone's invis undead every 3 seconds while travelling?  A bard would probably get fed up with your incompetence too. :P<P>If you only needed invis AND levitate to get through one section, then it may have been wiser to have the bard stay at the ledge (if no mobs), sing those two songs until the group got to a safe spot, then levitate down and die someplace their corpse is retrievable.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It also depends on the level of the bard and the situation.  He/She might have only been singing one song because that is the only song that was needed at the time.  Playing a bard for hours on end can get tiring.  If there is a time not to weave and they can just sing one song to relax a few then that is good.  Also some songs can not be weaved.  Some that can be weaved can lose their full effect.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hi Llumis. Seems like you had just as bad a day as I did...I was in the bottom of CC on the Queen camp when the warrior-puller got overconfident. By the time all the aggro was said and done, it was just him, me, and a shaman who was LOM versus pretty much the whole lower spider area there. The shaman trucked out with SOW. The warrior went down tanking, while I gated out with half a red bubble left. BUT...when I landed at the Iceclad bridge where I was bound, there was a dire wolf waiting for me. LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...took most of two hours to finally recover from all that mess.<P>I know what you mean about bad players. I have a whole list of player peeves, and many of them are related to bards. Now don't get me wrong...I LOVE bards. But bards take a lot of skill and dedication to play well. Anyone can play a bard, but to REALLY play a bard takes something a little extra. You can definitely tell in most cases when a bard is someone's alt or someone's main, and not just because of their gear. The bard who can't twist, can't keep track of what songs he's playing, and thinks he's a tank? Yep, he's an alt or eBaby for sure. The one who is heavily armored, watching his aggro, constantly twisting and always seems to have the right songs at the right time? He's a main for sure...or else a long-established alt that someone has really taken the time and learned to play well.<P>As for how I handle the bad players...quite simply, I don't group with them. There's always another group, a better group, that needs a cleric. I'm in no hurry to get to 60, I can take the time to travel and find competent people to play with. Nuff said.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>M&M Brewing Company<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Interesting topic too discuss.<P>In general I don't think all twinks are bad but you do find the few that have been powerleveled and their skills do not match there level.  <BR>As to a bard twisting songs this relies very heavily on the type of connection in real life the person has with a high speed connection and good ping times twisting 3 or 4 songs is easy but if your connection is poor you may only be able to handle 1 song.<P>We had a similiar discussion about twinking in guild chat last night one of the warriors noticed a low level warrior (under level 15) in full cobalt armour, wielding BoBDE and a Exquisite Velium Warsword and would you believe he also had an RBB on.  Now that is just sick.  I do not blame the guy in my guild almost crying when he saw this and feeling a little depressed as he has only just got a wurmslayer and if still in full crafted at level 30.<BR>Needless to say this twink was killing level 20 ish mobs solo just with the fact he hit so hard and fast and was hardly getting hit himself.  He will suffer in later levels though because his dodge, parry, and riposte skills will be inferior too many other warriors.<P>Anyway just my 2 cents.<BR>Nazrin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I wouldn't be too hard on the bard.  My main is a bard and my alt is a cleric.  As stated, no other song should be twisted with invis song; unlike other songs, when that song stops you reappear.  There are a couple other things about bard songs you should know.<P>Mana songs are a tic-based songs that need to be on when the tic occurs.  If he's twisting it with another song, you probably aren't getting a fast regeneration of mana because other other songs are playing on the tic.<P>Some of our fighting songs do not have an icon that you can see. Largo's and Bellow's are examples.  He could be twisting two of these and one other and you would only see one icon.  If you want to know what the bard is doing, you need to go to chat filter options and make sure bard songs is turned on where you get the bard messages in your chat screen.  <P>When I fight with my bard, I typically play a haste song and a mob snare-type song.  With caster mobs, I will go to instruments and buff the group with resists.  If connection is good, I twist a 3rd song (depending on the situation).  During downtime, I play mana song.  I can make myself look good to others by twisting 3 songs that show icons on the buff screen, but they may not be the best songs for that situation.  Three songs are easy to twist, but network lag can also make a bard look bad.<P>Lastly, if you can chat with your bard during a fight, you have a bad bard.  We're too busy working the keyboard to talk.  I tell my group members at the beginning of the night that I'm not ignoring them, I'm twisting the night away!<P>You might have had a bad bard, but I thought I'd give you the other side of the story.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A couple things I thought I'd share  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>First, it's hard to play a bard well. I used to hate all bards (I wanted to start a Guild called No Bards Allowed but Verant would not approve the name) until I met a bard who could actually play his class. This was almost a year into the game! I was amazed at what he added to a group, simply amazed. And at that point I decided to find out more about bards. What I found out really opened my eyes, bards are hard to play well. Hard. And I proved that to myself by playing one, I'm up to level 45 now.<P>Second, not all players are equal. I was grouped with a level 33 Shaman a week or so ago and he was regening mana REALLY slowly even with clarity. As our main healer this was hurting our pull rate terribly. So I began to watch him rather than the monsters. He rarely sat. It turned out HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MEDITATE. He had no idea he had to be in his spell book with the meditate button pressed to regain mana faster. At level 33.

</FONT><HR>"there is a 51 bard on Thlouxe Paells that doesnt have the mana song yet. He "hasn't been able to get back to town to get it yet"."<P>Clarity song is a sore spot for some bards, at this point in his career, it's obvious that this 51 bard refuses to buy it to avoid playing a mana battery. <P>A bard is very hard to play well and a bad conn really makes it harder. I am playing a bard as my latest alt (up to level 31 so far) and I'm a bit worried that I'm not developing good grouping skills because its very easy to solo as a bard; however I plan to deliberately slow down my leveling to learn those skills. With my 56k con I can twist 3 songs in a lag-free zone and sometimes only 1 in a zone with a particularly bad frame rate (Warsliks Woods feels like I'm playing in molassas). <P>And as one poster said, dont assume that a bard isn't twisting just because you don't have 3 or 4 blinking icons up, quite a few songs don't have icons and if you have spell effects and bard song spam turned off, you will never know they are going. <P>Clarity song is one such song actually.... It's quite annoying when people send you tells "play clarity song" at all -- dammit its my choice what to play -- but even more annoying when I *am* playing it and they just haven't bothered to check.<P>Valya Wanderfoot, 57 Paladin<BR>Alaiya Wanderfoot, 55 Cleric<BR>Mellisan Sforzanda, 31 Bard</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Many good points here. Bards are a class where you are generally really good or just really bad. There isn't much of a middle ground. I always keep my bard songs turned on so I can see when they are singing. But a point here that I wanted to make is that, as the cleric, and especially when I have no backup healer, if I tell a bard to sing clarity, it is for a reason. Yes bards are an incredibly versatile class with many options, but to a cleric in a group with a very fast pull rate, there is only one song I want to hear.<P>As an aside since this seems to be a bard + cleric converstion, my friend has a 57 bard and a 54 cleric. I've seen him take some of the most amazing mobs with his two toons just by doing nothing but singing his fight songs twisted with clarity, and having his cleric cast celestial healing exactly every 24 seconds. He offered to let me try it one time where I was using his cleric (my cleric did not have the spell at the time). At the end of the fight on a mob with about 8k hp, and me without a real clarity, I had full mana. THAT is how powerful celestial healing can be when a bard is in my group, and THAT is why I ask for mana song. I also did not get aggroed on the entire fight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>my alternate bard (actually my first character....only level 15 now) has an easy time with twisting, it's NOT hard to learn. in crushbone I managed to keep 4 songs up for a good 10 minutes, 3 is basic. if I get into a high lag area, I treat it like a raid and turn things off to keep my ability to twist high.<P>Bards are one of, if not THE hardest classes to learn to play well. I actually amazed a bard in my guild when I causually mentioned that I trust a bard to play what is needed to be played whenever. The most I ask a bard to do is try to pulse any sort of mana song into a twist when they can, and that only when I'm extremely LOM, a condition I try not to be in.<P>------------------<BR>The patchwork cleric<BR>Domus Divinae<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Couple of points.<P>1. Bet ya anything the 50+ bard had the "mana song" in his spell book!<P>2.  When I'm playing my bard with a cleric in a group, I send a tell asking how we should work together.  Many times the best use of downtime is for me to top everyone's HPs off with heal song, then play mana song.  If tanks are beatup bad, normally cleric heals and I play mana song throughout the downtime session.  I also ask all casters to give me mana checks when they drop below 50 percent.  Communication between a bard and a cleric is extremely important.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I know a number of good bards.  I am happy to group with them and like to play with them.  they are incredibly versatile and, like druids, can make any outing easier on everyone.<P>But, I have a very difficult time believing a bard of that level who has actually played that bard for those levels would not know that invis can't be twisted with anything else.  Every bard knows this.  Just like every shaman knows how to med.  There is one exception to this.  EBay.  Those people who think that they don't know need to know any strategy, but can buy an account and have a highpowered character and be successful.  Every 9th level warrior knows about meditate. They hear the casters complainging about it.<P>And I agree with Aean that educating your group is a good thing.  But, not everyone wants to get educated.  I love to group with people that know how to play.  I hate grouping with people that don't.  Teaching a warrior how to taunt is doable.  Teaching a warrior that you want to hold the handle of the sword is not.  <P>Good hunting, and keep grouping with Bards, they are fun.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have a theory actually about how these people come to be what we see / group with.<P>Some of my conclusions are:<BR><OL TYPE=1><BR><LI>Ignorance: They simply dont realize how immersive, huge and complex EQ is, so they buy it thinking "oo sounds fun to try for a weekend" and poof there they are!  Without knowing the basics of things like KSing, Meditating, Taunting, etc.<BR><LI>Laziness: They dont want this to be a "Job" so they just dont worry about learning the particulars.  "Why should I spend 10 minutes reading web pages about how to be an effective class_00?"<BR><LI>Experience: Be it age or lack there of, or a preconcived notion that this will be just like Game_03.  Also can be followed by "But I watch my roommate / friend / spouse / parent play all the time!"<BR><LI>Acquired: Possible Ebay or family / friend donated.<BR></OL><P>These people dont deliberatly try to play poorly, but end up not quite fitting into "Main Stream" Norrath.  Sad fact, but it happens.<P>/shrug<P>I do what I can to help clue people in, and if it gets to be to much I distance myself from them.<P>------------------<BR>~Calimayrn Anam'Cara<BR>50th Cleric of Tunare<BR>~Calizana Rhinelander<BR>Floating Barbarian Champion<BR><A HREF="http://www.lostorder.com" TARGET=_blank>Lost Order of Akalabeth</A><BR>Veeshan</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006139&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006139&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
