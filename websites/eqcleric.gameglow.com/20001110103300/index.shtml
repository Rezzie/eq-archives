Some of this is speculation on my part, but to the best of my knowledge here is what happened:<br><br>-> On the 21st Gameglow took a snapshot of my site (along with a slew of others) and moved it to a different machine, complete with a different IP address.<br><br>-> Sometime between the 21st and the 24th Gameglow changed the DNS entries to point to the new machine.<br><br>-> Either late on the 23rd or very early in the morning of the 24th the new DNS entries took effect.<br><br>-> Early yesterday evening Gameglow technical staff corrected the forums problems (I'm guessing they hadn't updated the UBB settings properly when they took the snapshot).<br><br>Needless to say the move could have been handled more smoothly (e.g. I could have been notified ahead of time to take appropriate actions), but there was no intention to disrupt operations.  I apologize for the inconvenience.<br><br>Provided my nasty e-mails to certain parties don't get me banned, access should remain smooth now.<br><br>FYI<br>Rayne</blockquote></p>

First of all, I apologize for the forums being down.  It seems that the host decided to move the site (and other Gameglow sites) to another machine.  They assured me that all the messages, user permissions, etc are still there, they just can't seem to coax the script into finding them.  Hopefully they will be available again asap.  It would have been nice to have been contacted about this in the future, but alas that did not happen.<br><br>Secondly, there has been a bit of rumbling about the lack of updates on the front page.  I'm not quite as oblivious as I may seem.  I plan on taking new steps to address this.  Hopefully they will work out well.<br><br>FYI<br>Rayne<br><br></blockquote></p>

The official text:<blockquote>After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction.  This spell's current function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group.  As such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value decreased.</blockquote><br>I cannot comment more at this time.

<blockquote>
If you haven't heard already, Verant has finally gotten around to fixing the Max Haste bug.  This bug was: any haste item + any haste spell/song yielded Max Haste (75% speed up).  Therefore, a FBSS an Augmentation was just as fast as a Cloak of Flames  and Aanya's Quickening.  Now I must admit, this fix makes sense, oh, if it was done <b>a year ago</b>!  This bug has been in effect forever.<br><br>Whether you have a haste item or not, once you reach the 40s possibly and certainly the 50s your melee group members will definitely have a haste item.  This nerf affects everyone.  Now everything will be killed slower.  Sure, I can ask for SLTW (250 mana) instead of Augmentation (90 mana) to reach max haste, but then I lose about 19AC and Stamina regen, not to mention the fact that I've just asked for the equivalent of three Aug's from the 'chanter.  The bottom line with this change is everyone will now kill things slower (either from slower tanks or oom Enchanters and Shamans). <br><br>I did want to touch on one point Gordon made, that is that the FBSS will lose value due to it's lower haste.  Quite honestly I disagree with that statement.  The FBSS's value will hold just fine.  Why?  It's by far the most attainable haste item in the game (yet is still a long camp).  The best haste items, the dragon, god, and questable Sky items, are so rare as to not have any factor in this equation.  The good haste items out of Kunark (Runebranded Girdle and Siblisian Berserker's Cloak) are very rare.  I can't comment on the Sash of the Dragonborne, but I suspect it's comparable to an FBSS.  The Swirlspine Belt and Hangman's Noose are SLOWER than the FBSS, so they won't further diminish the FBSS's value.  Sigh, I don't see this having the desired impact.  Haste was haste, the real determining factor was the stats, AC, and slot of the item, with Back slots being the most desirable.<br><br>It's hard to fault Verant for fixing an obvious bug.  Fixing bugs is normally a good thing.  But when a bug has been in the game as long as the Max Haste bug I'm not sure it doesn't migrate from bug to feature.  Regardless, this change should have a noticeable impact on game play.</blockquote></p>
