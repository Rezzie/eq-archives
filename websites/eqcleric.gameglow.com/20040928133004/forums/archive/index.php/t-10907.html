<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiien</div><div class="date">10-24-2001, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We probably average about 4.5, it's almost always 4 or 5 clerics, although often 1 or 2 of those are twinks and alts played by people we'd rather have playing their main. Other than Ventani (who we're working on), we've never needed more than 5 clerics to do anything (although we've yet to do Tunare or AoW). Once you get used to not having any clerics around, it's really not so bad. More often than not, a druid is fine for healing AE damage in north wing/sleepers/yelinak, and more than 5 clerics in a heal rotation is overkill.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Irysangel</div><div class="date">10-24-2001, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have about 6-7 *active* clerics in our alliance, more moderately active that show up for the occasional raid....<br />
<br />
But it seems most events we are at 3 clerics, tops. Think the most we've ever had at a raid was a Trak raid with 5 of us there. We weren't quite sure what to do with ourselves.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Of course, then it's hard because everyone gripes if the clerics aren't going to raids, so you pretty much have to go to EVERY raid, and when you've gone to Fear/Hate about 40x in the past few months it gets reaaaal old. I've stopped going to Naggy and Vox entirely...I have no purpose there except to chaincast Aegolism on twinks and make the younger clerics feel useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is my biggest complaint about my class is the 'Cleric Guilt' that's slapped on anytime you don't feel like doing a raid.<br />

I've never heard of Tunare getting killed (mainly because I'm not into the endgame). How hard is she, and what does she do to require 10 or more clerics?<br />

strange anyone notice there are more and more guildless 60 clerics? i know at least three in my play hours</div></div><hr />

We tried her last weekend too and got her to 45% with 47. Could have gotten her bit lower had we not screwed around, but it wasn't going to die with those numbers.<br />
<br />
What she does? Hits for 900+, flurries and is totally immune to pretty much everything (if fire lure lands 30% I'd call that pretty immune to fire). Regens lot faster than your average mob too, and has a really annoyingly small range you can melee it from. Mmm and she has a trick which made agro control really difficult for us atleast (guessing AL found some way around this, we're working on a way atm =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">10-24-2001, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The number of clerics you need is directly perportional to the number of people you need.<br />
<br />
For Vox/Nagafen you need 24, for Trakanon you need 40, for the hardest SoV mobs you need 60.   60 people = 10 clerics.<br />
<br />
With time the numbers needed to kill will become less, as you grow in power etc.   Trakanon for instance can be killed with 12 top notch people equiped with primal and/or better weapons. <br />

If they get lifetapped or feared instead hed die easily :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">10-24-2001, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shrug have, say<br />
g1: Cleric, Shaman, Warrior, Warrior, Monk, Mage<br />
g2: Cleric, Enchanter, Rogue, Rogue, Wizard, Paladin<br />
<br />
Just CoH those that get Trak Touch. We did it with 15 or so with a fairly similar composition. Had 1 more wiz, 1 more clr and i think a necro added to those 12.<br />
