</FONT><HR>Well, after a few days of reviewing sites and getting myself back into the swing of things, I've made my way to Thurgadin for the first time. However, I'm now at kind of a loss. Does anyone know any good hunting grounds around 40th level? The only ones I know are the old traditional ones...Lower Guk and Sol B. I saw a lot of blue critters in Eastern Wastes and Great Divide as I passed through, but few people my level. Where are all the 40s hunting these days? <P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>Microbrewer of Brell<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I finally gave up and at 45th and went to KC (I hate SolB so I didn't want to go there)<P>As far as vellious I guess you could do orcs in EW, don't really know about that.  Always had trouble finding groups in vellious when I was in my 40s.<P>In kunark you can go hunt outside of KC in DL.

</FONT><HR>If you have friends or guildmates in high 30's/low 40's, give Kaesora a try.  Incredible xp, lots of undead, decent loot (dusty ransacker packs, spirit tomes are probably only ones of interest to a cleric).  Its major drawback (and the reason you won't find a pickup group there) is the CR if the group is wiped out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Last week, my RL friend (38 warrior) and I (41 cleric) were tired of doing OverThere ledge groups, and basically tired of doing the 'at level x go here, and at level y go there' thing. We decided to do some exploring, head off to a few zones we hadn't been to, but some of the map sites said had creatures out level. After a bit of looking, we decided to look around Trak's teeth, Emerald Jungle, and City of Mist. Ok, ok, I'm sure a lot of you have been there and think it's nothing new at this point, but since we're not in a guild, and lately many of the people we know have been leaving EQ for better things, it's not that easy to get a full group to hit some of these places.<P>We stayed in Traks teeth for a night, some of what's in there is great, much of it is way over our heads. A quick jump to EJ, and we were wondering why there were only 4 other people in the zone. Basically, hunting at the zone line for the last 2 nights, we're doing great. It's very similar to OverThere as far as being able to run out and grab a mob whenever you're ready for one, and having really bad loot (even worse than OT, I think). If we had either a shaman or an enchanter, I'd be in heaven right now. Mobs are giving about a fifth to a quarter of a blue bubble per kill. We both made a level last night. Binding is the only problem, but it's really no further of a run from FV to EJ than it is to OT, and anyway, you can bind at Kaesora now, so that's the next zone over.<P>And best yet, we've still got some exploring to do. CoM is right there, and I've heard that's an interesting place. Maybe we'll head to Kaesora next.<P>Glad to know there's still places to go, as long as you're willing to 'go prepared', because there won't be many people out there to help if you run into problems.<P>-Aandain of Povar<BR>42nd Level Cleric of Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>My level 42 ranger does a lot of soloing in Eastern Wastes and has been since about level 36 or 37 or so.  It's also great for groups, so I don't often end up soloing for long. I often hear folks looking for healers, so you shouldn't have much trouble finding a group there.  Or if you can locate the lone rangers out there soloing (it's a great zone to fear kite animals in), they'd probably be pleased to have your company but are to shy to ask or even offer.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>At 40, Tikmaks in Greater Divide might still give you exp and should be solo-able as well as group friendly, too.  Same with feral kodiaks.  If you don't have Celestial Healing yet, you might want to try to get into a guardian wurm group, so you'll have it when you turn 44.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Tommara, Level 54 Vicar<BR>Tommar, Level 42 Ranger<BR>Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>For 45, if what you want is to get out of hell, go find a monk who is also 45 and ask him if he would like to get out of hell.<P>Go to Crystal Caverns and go down to the Geonid caves.  Go up and down the Geonid tunnel killing all the spawn and respawn. It is fast, easy, excellent exp.<P>At 40 Kaesora is wonderful.  You need to go there anyway at some point to kill Xalgoz and get that part of the Howling Stones Key quest.  There is a ton of good loot in Kaesora.  Most of the loot is in the library.  Spirit Tome (quick 2-3k), spectral shroud, kunzar cloak or mantle I forget which, shaman spear, monk two hand blunt, ranger dagger, rogue dagger, all in Library.  Spiders rarely drop awesome cleric shammy shield (can drop off any spider whatever people report), church area drops very rare necro staff, rare necro shield and xalgoz drops Blade of Xalgoz and Xalgoz fang (quest component for HS key).<P>The experience in there is tremendous.  And, there is other loot in this zone as well.  People get wiped out in there.  They need a res very very badly.  It is hard to get down there to get your corpse, it is hard to get a rogue down there to pull corpses.  I have been literally showered with thank yous, plat, and all around good feelings.  <P>I really like Kaesora.  City of Mist is excellent experience.  Crystal Caverns is excellent experience, has nice loot that no one wants to buy, and has a bank   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">, and is another place people have a tendency to become extremely grateful for a res.<P>At 40, I would go to Kaesora before it greens out. It is a super dungeon.  You can hunt there up till 45 or so, and even at 50, when I went back to get fangs for some friends, I was still getting good exp *even though* almost everything was green.  They boosted the exp modifier for that zone.<P>Kedge Keep is a neat dungeon to go to, if you can find a way not to breathe underwater.  Excelent exp and a new zone for most people at that level.<P>The Tower of Frozen Shadow is a really fun zone as well.  The keys on some floors are a tremendous pain to get.  Some floors are greener then others.  For instance, the 5th floor is greener then the 4th, but drops some excellent cleric drops.  Velium Spiked Helm and WEdding Band.  I dinged 49 on the 6th floor, very nice experience there for the level.  4th floor should be just right at 40.<P>Droga is a fun dungeon also, some real epic fights there, much of it should still be blue at 40.<P>And of course SolB and LGuk if you want to go camp phat lewts and get good exp, cause both are there.  But as you can see from the dungeon selections up there, I prefer to go places with a group of friends and never hear the words camp check in OOC.  I really enjoy hearing someone in the group say "HEY! We own this zone, we are the only ones in here".<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Mage/cleric should be able to do Kaesora.  At least, I could I think, because I know the zone, spawn rate and pathing pretty well.  There is a safe spot down by the church, that I could show you, but I am not sure I could tell you how to get there.  But I will try.<P>First off, Kaesora has both live and undead mobs.  You can usually travel all around it with either invis or invis to undead.  However, random spiders see invis.  So you need to con them.  Also, some of the ravenous nibblers or whatever they are sometimes spawn in with the undead, so look out for them and don't go too fast.  Here is how I would do it, to sort of see how it was going to work. <P>Both you and your friend bind right outside Kaesora.  The only thing that jumps me there is some skelly named Targashin or something.  Don't worry about him just kill him.  Zone in.  There may very well be half a dozen people getting fangs in the church.  If that is so, you can send them a tell, letting them know you don't want Xal, you want to PL your cleric friend, they might not mind if you come hunt there, and if you check in from time to time, they might let you know before they leave so you can come get the camp while it is still broken.  (One time I was there to get a fang and I was checking in while we were hunting in the library, and the camp had all gotten keys except for one rogue. The rogue was by himself, he was delighted to have us come down and heal him and help him out).<P>Zone into Kaesora.  Get regular invis on each of you.  Drop down the left pit drop.  The left pit is not very far.  The middle one is, don't drop off the pit straight ahead of you, there are always spiders down there that see invis and there are lots.  Have gate memmed and gate to the entrance if you have any trouble.  (after you drop down the left pit, there is a door straight ahead of you with a pit drop right behind it, this pit leads straight down into the undead area and is in many ways easier, but you might have a fight at the bottom of the pit, and I don't know about pet pathing to get down there, you would certainlyh want lev to get down.  You could ITU and drop down, particularly with lev, this is a very easy way to get to the library from down there, then just explore around).  Hug the right wall around until you are in the first corner of the big room with three spiders.  Check to see if all three are indiff.  One or more of the spiders may see you, and may attack.  Alternatively, you could make a pet after you drop down, that is a pretty safe spot.  I am not sure about best strategies for that area with a mage.  I would think a 40 cleric could heal your pet and you could have a cake walk of a time in there.  3 spiders at once can be problematic, especially when 2 people are learning how to work with each other.  Anyway, kill or invis past the three spiders in that big room.  Next stop is the doorway in the room with the 3 spawn.  Go in there and invis past or kill the 2 spiders in that room.  That room has a fake wall.  Go through the fake wall and down the tunnel, killing as you go.  Should be cake from that point on.  When you get to the library, pull the library out to the tunnel until it is clear, then you can set up in the library and should have no problems at all.<P>To give you an idea of the Church area difficulty, here is how we broke the church spawn.  49 cleric (me), 49 druid and 49 mage.  We went into the center of the church, right by where Xalgoz spawns and I took off ITU.  They started hitting me.  Mage waited 2-3 seconds and cast a pet.  Druid healed me a couple times.  Pet killed all the mobs.  (There is a large pit on the floor of the right side of the church facing the pulpit.  It is not a bad drop, but there are three undead down there, and it is a real pain to get 3 adds at once, they shouldn't come up if you are fighting, but you need to keep it clear, to avoid some of the problems with pathing and just because you will want to be killing stuff, and i like to avoid having monsters right below me).<P>Best place to pull the church:  When you get down to the end of the tunnel where you see the church, hug the left wall.  You get to a spot that is like a little natural alcove.  There are occasional roamers here, but it is pretty safe, and if your pet will stay there and mind, you should be able to pull to there.  <P>I have seen plenty of 50+ folks in this dungeon asking me for a res.  Be careful.  I think the two of you can do it, but you need to get to know the zone, and if you get over confident, it is quite easy to get swarmed by a gazillion greens in here.  And I would vote Earth Pet.  Like anywhere else, you don't want any runners.<P>This zone is perfect for what you want to do.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005996&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=005996&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
