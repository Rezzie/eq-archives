I was with a necro and a warrior in DSP and we were killing the lightcrawlers and zelniaks that roam throughout the Sanctus zone area. The warrior went out to pull and BAM got blinded by a lightcrawler. No problem, clerics come equipped with cure blindness. Unfortunately, my warrior ran off while blind and got lost in DSP. She ended up dying. She did get her loc, so off the necro goes with her locate corpse spell to drag it back to me so I could rez it. She found the warrior's corpse and began her journey half way across the zone to meet me. All of a sudden, I watch the necro's hp drop like a penny from the Empire State. Those dumb fungus in the zone that have aggro ranges the size of football fields picked up on her. Well, she killed two of them only to be blinded by a lightcrawler and die. So we now have a dead necro and a dead warrior somewhere in the zone. Good thing though, the necro also knew the loc of the corpses. So here I am, a defenseless cleric, no tank to help her beat off aggros. I wander out into DSP, find the corpses and begin back to the zone line to rez the necro, who happened to be the first corpse I ran into. I turn around and BAM, hit for 99hp by a fungus. Good thing divine aura was up, cast it and ran for the zone. I made it, rezzed necro, ran with necro to pick up warrior's corpse, rezzed warrior only to have them get pked while I was oom. It sucked.<br />
Oh well, it was a funny experience none the less. )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruloe</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wasn't with the group when it happened but found out later when they were all sitting around laughing at the wizard.  A Manaburn team was going in after Gore once and right before the pull one of the wizards clicked his J-boots incase things went bad.<br />
Soon as he clicked them Gore showed up so he hit his Manaburn.  What he forgot was when he had clicked his J-boots it put him on as his target so he ended up Manaburning himself instead of Gore.  I laughed so hard when they were poking fun at him later.<br />
<br />
As a personal story, back when my guild was killing the Servitor of Luclin in griegs, one of our rangers was knocked unconscious just as the Serv died.  He was in my group and I saw his purple lifebar slowly dropping from the dot and I asked the raid if I should heal him or not since he was just a ranger afterall and we had no deaths on the raid anyways.  Some said yeah to heal him and others just crowded around him and laughed at him as he was dying off.  Right at the end I hit him with a DL and made him pop up back to life.  We all got a good laugh out of it and some good screenshots as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystifaere</div><div class="date">09-04-2002, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda the same story as ruloe :p <br />
<br />
Our group decided to train-break in KC before we went to take RCY. Just about done with the first when Captains &quot;lost it&quot; and came right through us. Our chanter and tank were taking a beating. Tank goes &quot;I'm fine get to me later&quot; - so I did the usual rem/cel heal on the chanter and switched to CH on the tank.....At this point he had about 4 on him and his hitpoint bar was dropping as fast as the 10 sec clock :eek: <br />
Well he laid down and went purple just as CH hit him, flipping him right up again:rolleyes: -We decided to zone out since all of us were laughing soo hard :D And yes I did give him a hard time about being a Monk wannabe :p <br />
<br />
&quot;Be nice! - I just might save your life!&quot;</div></div><hr />
