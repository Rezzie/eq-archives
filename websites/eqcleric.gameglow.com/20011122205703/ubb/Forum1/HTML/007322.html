</FONT><HR>To be honest ... <P>1/2: We already have nice ac - but we still die rather fast if we get aggro. No big deal though as avoiding us getting aggro is a major part of the end game. So, if we could tank as well as a paladin - that aspect of the game would be reduced.<P>3/4: CH is already fairly overpowered in the end game. Making us more mana-efficient and/or able to regen faster for a short period of time (read killing a single major target) will only make that more so.<P>5: I dont use that many invis potions per week - its not overly hard waiting for someone else to invis you in most cases. Heck, its not like the raid starts without the clerics.<P>Dont get me wrong - I would love those things - I just dont see 1-4 happening in a significant manner as that would reduce the game of avoiding cleric aggro and make our already overpowered CH even more so. 5 would be nice I freely admit but simply making invis potions stackable would do the trick for me.<P>I think we should instead ask for some better melee skills to be honest - because that wont improve our already rather overpowered raid skills - but it would improve our soloing greens skills. Maybe ask for 200 1hb/2hb as well as being put on the former sk/pal melee table could do it. Though, soon the paladins would rightfully complain, heh.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=9406" TARGET=_blank>Mikar Vicarious</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 10-19-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to see something that would revive my interest in EQ. I only play to support my guild anymore, I'm too busy with DAOC. Oops, did I say that out loud?<P>Seriously, things I'd like to see clerics get...<P>1. Either a raise to the Dodge skill, or addition of the Parry skill, or both. We need some sort of defensive increase.<BR>2. Things to make us better at what we do (healing and protecting the group) without stepping on the toes of the other classes too much, such as group resist buffs and a group damage-reduction buff.<BR>3. From the "good RP idea" section, I'm still waiting on my point-blank AE versus undead (Word of Turning).<BR>4. A self-only mana gain spell similar to the wizard Harvest spell. One shot of mana every so often. Doesn't step on the toes of enchanters, and gives us a way to "panic button" that one extra bit of mana when we need it most.<BR>5. Bash. I carry a shield, don't I? There isn't a whole lot more science to backhanding someone with a shield than there is to clouting them with a hammer. And I don't care if they cap the skill at 50, ANY chance to interrupt a caster is a good thing.<P>Nuff said for now.

</FONT><HR>Things Clerics need to improve gameplay are not very hard to see.<P> Our biggest albatross is that when compared to others, we are compared as if we were in a full group, because that's where they expect us to be.<P>There is no arguement from the dev team that this occurs, because they cannot see any changes to clerics that wouldn't affect end game balance.<P> A big hurdle for them to consider, but then they turn around and "adjust" individual caster classes, and tweak their own benifits further leaving the cleric behind on the single player scale.<P> It's that single player scale that makes the game very tough at points, very frustrating, and many times forces folks to quit, switch classes, and in turn forcing uber guilds to powerlevel rez mules for raids.<BR> The end game for the cleric is one of servitude by design, all the service, all the sacrifice, none of the glory.<P> To that end, simple requests should be tailored around perceived values that developemnt team faces. One thing we do have going for us is that there is a new "BOSS" Mob at VI and he is tasked with retaining the customer base in the face of other emerging competitors.<P> Clerics need to have some simple adjustments.<BR> 1- Be considered a separate issue from other  casters. Period.<BR> 2- Consider all level of play, issues at each spell increase and soloability during each.<BR> 3- keep the Group enhancemnt factor that is held over their head on the shelf when reviewing the class. It's a separate issue.<BR> 4- If clerics had more flair there might be more of them. Folks level fast enough soloing so saying this would unbalance the end game is a moot point. Increase the fun factor.<BR> 5- Travel dificulties. Worst in game. Just behind Paladins in dificulty.<BR> 6- Soloing, arguements could be made, but there aren't enough undead zones in game through out all levels to make this supposed "Best at fighting undead" factor anything but a joke. Necros and any other caster can far out do a cleric vs undead simply for the fact  that they have a form of mana regen, a pet, and a varied and stackeable arsenal of spells and dots available to them. Clerics have the gun, but just not the ammo, not the getaway car, so are often seen as the victim in these situations. This perception is hammered in by their other limitations and  competition of other healing and enhancement classes.<BR> 7- Monotony and routine, comforting for some, tedium for others. There must be a middle ground. If a player becomes bored, he becomes a detriment to others, and the game loses luster for more than just the cleric-player. Dangerous to the survival of the game, especially when that class is basic for the higher end game.<BR> 8- Spell line up. Needs reviewed. mana efficiency is tight for clerics, with or without a chanter, bard, or necro to feed them mana. It's a limited linear line of spells. All based on one flavor of resists. So in fact clerics are in effect punished by twice if nor more than that, for this linear thinking in design.<BR> 9- creativity: Deities reflect various forms of power in Norrath. Disease, growth, destruction, decay, etc etc. A Cleric's spells should reflect this and not be a linearly limited. See below for examples. Clerics belong to one deity, not a pantheon of deities where melange magics might dominate thereby justifying one flavor of ice cream for the masses.<P>So this is a basic overview of some of the problems with cleics, a surface scan. Instead of argueing each and every limitation, comparing to other classes it might be better to find solutions to the whole.<BR> Whereas countering cannot be done with a wide brush and white washed to hide flaws that have existed and been exasberated for over 3 years.<P>--------------------------------------------<P> 1- Increase melee cap to 200 for 1hb by lvl 55. This is still below hybrid skill levels, and without double attack, parry, and other limitations, would be a miniscule enhancement  for the class on par with the shaman's 1hp skills. (same might be considered for druid's 1hs skills)<BR> 2- after lvl 50 allow clerics to go onto the  melee dmg table (original) limiting and capping dmg by class is silly. The max dmg done by the rare hit is miniscule on the whole game overview. IF not allwoing them to hit as hard, remove dmg cap, and or make for a limitation in minimum damage, so a cleric can feel he is contributing to the game when grouped.<BR> 3- Effectiveness vs greens through out the game. Green cons are the bane of clerics due to their limited capabilities in melee, travel, and adventuring-exploration. An entire facet of the game has been removed from the cleric's capeabilities by the class's limitations, further making it less desireable to play, no matter the needs for it at the high end of the game.<BR>   3a- increase cleric DODGE CAP to 150 by lvl 60. Or in addition increase Cleric defensive skills on par with hybrids.<BR>  1-50 (75 dodge) 50-55 (100 dodge) 56-60 (150) dodge.<BR>   Defense caps at 200 early in Cleric's career. Increase to 225 for more avoidance by lvl 60.<BR>  These singly or on conjunction might make surviving green cons long enough to get off a finishing spell, root, or escape via gate or running to a zone line.<BR> 4- BASH. Clerics wield a shield all their lives. They are casters too, and know the effectiveness of being disturbed mid cast by a wall of iron in their face, along with claws, fists, weapons, and magics.<BR> At the high end of the game, half of the cleric's repetoire of magics are no longer effective (creatures are unstunnable), and already suffer the double save penalty.<BR> To balance this out, if a cleric has to melee a caster, a backhand swing of their shield should be an option.<BR> Shaman's already have this as an option (prekunark) as all races for shaman's were oversized and therefor had racial capabilties to stun and interrupt.<BR> How much of a skill in bashing? 3/4 of what a Hybrid might have would be in order at least. Again this might be a life saver for a cleric in a single situation (solo), or in a single group situation, giving some flavor to the cleric's arsenal,but in no way overpowering the end game. BASH (75)<BR> 5- Flavor variations. SPELLS<BR>   5a- Classify the deities that cleric's can follow into classes other than MAGIC based.<BR>  Examples<BR>      Bertoxx-Innoruk-Cazic Thule Disease.<BR>      Brell Bristlebane- poison(earth)<BR>      Karana-Tunare- Fire(sun-growth renewal)<BR>   etc etc etc.<BR>   5b- once classified determine a single GROWTH spell- ie one spell that grows with the cleric throughout their career.<BR> That is from fist level to 60th it increases in power level by level. For balance all damage is similarily applied and cast.<BR> There should be one version of each type of spell for clerics, DOT-AOE-DD that grows as the cleric grows, not different spells each circle, but one spell, period. Simpler to code and simpler to apply to the current game.<BR>  DOT Example- Earth Drain (dot)(Brell,Bristlebane...Poison based) Casting time 6 recast time 6+Lvl  Mana 200+(3xLvl) Dmg Type Over time DMG =(Lvlx 1.5) each tic for (lvl/3)+1 Tics  SO at lvl 60 it would do 90pts per tick for 21 tick. Very high potential dmg (maximum of 1890). But Mana cost would be 380 mana.<BR>  <BR>  DD Example Green Fire Strike(DD)(Nature dieties-firebased) Cast time 2 Recast time 5+(lvl/10) Mana 50 + (lvl +40)/10 (lvl 1: 54 mana to 60 mana at 60). DMG direct Fire based- Lvlx2+15 (17 to 135 max)<P>  AOE Example Cursed Cloud (disease-Bertox-innie etc). Cast time: 4 recast time 4+ (lvl/10) Mana: 10 + 2xlvl (12 to 130 mana)  DMG (from caster aoe) 10+ 4xLvl (14 to 250) <P> These are three examples of each type that could be added, only code changes required would be to change names, deity availability, etc. But mana, cast time, dmg, etc would be similar across the board. ONLY DMG MAGIC BASE would be changed. IE EARTH(poison) NATURE(Fire) to give each Cleric a differenct flavor.<BR>  Cursed Cloud could be Fire Cloud for Tunare, Sandstorm for Brell, etc. But all would be balanced as they would do same dmg  cost same cast same way and in same amount of time. This would apply to the DOT and DD type spells too. Clerics would be distinguished by class, and be more of a tatical concern for encounters, soloing, and pvp.<P>------------------<BR> Utility Spells-Self Spells<P> With the concerns of single players and casual players wanting to play a cleric, or with pick up groups where the maximum efficiency member selection cannot be achieved.<BR> Clerics suffer from competitionof other healer, utility classes through out their career and this occurs drastically in two segments of the game for the cleric. This is where many clerics end up dying or going into retirement.<BR>  From 22-33 Shamans and druids often bring more to the table than a cleric, especially in outdoor situations, until the cleric gets CH. As the other healers grow in capeabilities the cleric remains linear until and IF a cleric can find a copy of a lvl 44 spell that is only dropped in dungeons way above the level they require it to remain competitive. This is Celestial healing. More of a dmg amelioration spell than an actual heal. If a spell is so rare and dificult to get it can not be considered in the balncing scheme. <BR> Post 50 Shamans and Druids gain in power of healing and damage mitigation. Either by slowing, or other utility spells (regen, dmg shields, speed etc) That in many encounters a cleric is only needed if things go bad. The buffs a cleric has only can compete with a druid's if compared enmass, versus singly. Regen and mana regen components make a cleric's buffs non-essential in much of the game due to armor, weapons, effects and utility spells of druids and shaman.<BR> Complete heal is a pre-50 spell and situational at best so it cannot be applied to the overview of the class disparities. There is always a way around it, except in the end game encounters, and then often, the role of the cleric may be for OOPSIES, or as a health battery chain healing and nothing else. And Players have been conditioned by the game to behave in such a way by design and limited creativity.<BR> Solutions? Consider the following-<BR> <BR> State of Divinity- once reaching lvl 50 a Cleric has proven his dedication to the game and to his deities. This is reflected in an aura they gain upon reaching this plateau. mana flows directly from the god to the pc.<BR> How to apply this in game?<BR> Perhaps a spell, or simply coding game to see a cleric standing or medding as always meditating. If a Spell it should be self only, long in duration, and increase his healing-regen and mana regen rates. The Mana cost should be negligible. Availabitlity of this spell should be common and require allied status with your own church to receive. No involved quests necessary to gain this as reaching lvl 50 and allied status is tedious enough as it is for a cleric.<P> Shield of Divinity- self only buff. A short duration dmg shield that reflects all dmg applied to the cleric to what ever is attacking him in melee. Dmg is still suffered by the cleric, but also by he who strikes the cleric in anger. Casteable only after lvl 50- duration should be akin to divine barrier series.<P> ENNUI or Sacrificial Strike- All of a clerics stamina, mana and half his remaining health go into a single blast aimed at a single target. High potential Damage, the cleric is effectively under the effects of rez type effects until spell wears off (it will overwrite any and all buffs on him up- and is non dispellable)<BR> Done early if could do more damage to a target, but that would remove any chance of that cleric being effective in that encounter.<BR> Damage saves would be as if a lure type spell were cast-each would be based on that cleric's faith (see above examples) Dmg applied should be on order of the level of sacrifice done. Cast time should be near instataneous. Effect massive damage strike virtually guarantees that cleric's death, if the target isn't eliminated.<BR>  COST- MANA remaining+ Stamina +half remaining health.<BR>  DMG-  (MANA+ HEALTH removed + Stamina lost)/2* +100.  *note: this formula should be tweaked, but the strike should be on the order of a supernova or higher( upto 3500 dmg maybe upto 5000), this is the clerics very own life force being added to the mana he channels from his God.<BR>  EFFECT- massive dmg on target. A helpless and soon dead Cleric unless target is eliminated. To make this more of a sacrifice the cleric could suffer an exp death too, which is already likely if cast on an epic encounter target already. NOTE targets likely to save vs some of the damage, but should never save versus all of the damage.<P> Veil of the Gods- Self only post 50 spell. A cloak of maigc covers the cleric allowing him to walk unseen(not run applies snare) through a hostile area, to succor others, or to simply travel. It would overwrite sow, jboots, tboots, and scale of wolf. Effect lvl 50 snare lvl 50 improved invisibility. Mana cost 150. Cast time 1. Self Only LVL 35+ Duration same as improved invisibility.<P> Conversion- An unresistable single target spell that temporarily makes that target NON KOS to the cleric. (effectively a alliance+Atone spell in one) Unfortunately the change is on the target itself not to the cleric and other in area would no longer see that target nor the cleric in a favorable light. Named mobs, gods, avatars and epic encounters would be immune to effects of this spell.<P> These are but a few examples of what the celric class can use, and direly needs to remain viable in Everquest and to be fun through out.<BR> The arguement that the cleric is designed solely as a support character is not a viable arguement where in the game so many other classes have so much variance in skills, spells, or equipment that can mimic such capablities of other classes.<BR> True the cleric is considered a force multiplier when in a group and the pace of the game can be dictated by limiting a cleric's capablities within such a structure.<BR> But to do so is short sighted and the easy way to control the game. This makes a class dificult to play, and more dificult to enjoy in all but one facet of the game.<BR> Faced with more emerging games and competition in the MMORPG market, EQ needs to adapt and bend to keep it's current customer base interested.<BR> The adaptation of the Melee classes skills recently was one such effort in that direction. To make all melee classes feel and be more effective and desireable.<BR> Clerics unfortunately have been the red-headed stepchild of eq, and suffered few gains to all their "nerfs" and limitations.<BR> To save the game you've sacrificed part of your player population forcing others to powerlevel twinks or alts to fill in the gaps for the end game.<BR> Diversity in capabilities and playability are essential for the cleric to survive in the evolving game. For if clerics see the game as a tedium, it will become that and more for other players in the game too.<BR> One maxim provided by the staff on several occassions was-keep the cleric happy and the group will do well. This too should be applied to considering these proposals when balancing casters classes and tweaking their abilities.<BR> Once again these are suggestions not demands, but common sense should prevail when they are read. At no time should any single portion be discarded, but seen on it's own merits as to how it would affect clerics through out their career in EQ from 1 to 60.<BR> Then and only then should it be seen as to how it compares to other casters, other healers (which should be separate issues for consideration).<P>Brodder FoamyMugs<BR>Bartender of Brell<BR>Terris Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Id also like to add..<P><BR>"ENNUI or Sacrificial Strike- All of a clerics stamina, mana and half his remaining health go into a single blast aimed at a single target. High potential Damage, the cleric is effectively under the effects of rez type effects until spell wears off (it will overwrite any and all buffs on him up- and is non dispellable)<BR>Done early if could do more damage to a target, but that would remove any chance of that cleric being effective in that encounter.<BR>Damage saves would be as if a lure type spell were cast-each would be based on that cleric's faith (see above examples) Dmg applied should be on order of the level of sacrifice done. Cast time should be near instataneous. Effect massive damage strike virtually guarantees that cleric's death, if the target isn't eliminated.<BR>COST- MANA remaining+ Stamina +half remaining health.<BR>DMG- (MANA+ HEALTH removed + Stamina lost)/2* +100. *note: this formula should be tweaked, but the strike should be on the order of a supernova or higher( upto 3500 dmg maybe upto 5000), this is the clerics very own life force being added to the mana he channels from his God.<BR>EFFECT- massive dmg on target. A helpless and soon dead Cleric unless target is eliminated. To make this more of a sacrifice the cleric could suffer an exp death too, which is already likely if cast on an epic encounter target already. NOTE targets likely to save vs some of the damage, but should never save versus all of the damage"<P><BR>Is a REALLY cool idea but I think it would be hard for verant to get something like this in game. In D&D  i love how clerics are able to do some tanking of easy mobs and  have MAJORLY kick ass off. spells.  But i know VI  is limited in what they can do under the current programing they are using and something like this spell  will never make it to game unless they overhauled the  whole damn coding.  I really love the idea though.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Maybe you dont understand.  When i have a greenie attack me, if i'm travelling, there is a simple thing called Trepidation  OR   Root / Atone to take care of it.

IF those arent enough, then the group that needs you will set up means to get you.<P>There is no / none/ zero/ zilch justification for having better melee skills for a cleric.

Full Ennui from a level 51 cleric *never* hits for less than 2K HP...<P>QUICK! Get 25 51+ clerics here...<P>Don't think it would happen? Then yer crazy. Why would a guild spend 10-15 minutes buffing/remedding for a big fight, plus put people's lives on the line (well, their CR time, at least), and another ten minuted fighting when you could be GUARANTEED victory? Hell, they'd prolly PL alts on half the people in the guild to 51, zone um in, camp them, use their mains to fight down to the staging area, camp-out and CotH the clerics in-instead of ooc looking like <BR><monk_01> says out of character, Assist me on this Uber_loot_dropper_01<BR><cleric_01> says out of character, CH on MA<BR>(3 seconds later)<BR><cleric_02> says out of character, CH on MA<BR>(3 seconds later)<BR><cleric_03> says out of character, CH on MA<P>It would be<BR><monk_01> says out of character, Assist me on this Uber_loot_dropper_01<BR><bored_raid-leader_01> says out of character, all clerics, target mob and Ennui in 3<BR><bored_raid-leader_01> says out of character, 2<BR><bored_raid-leader_01> says out of character, 1<BR>(3 seconds later)<BR><bored_raid-leader_01> says out of character, OK, everyone gate your cleric mules back to the entrance and camp in your mains so we can divide loot.<P>On the melee subject-I'd be happy if they would just either make cleric mobs as bad as we are, or us as good as they are-what do I mean by this? Perfect example:<BR>Cazic Cenobite in CT, level 35 cleric (has to be-was casting wrath and sup heal). This guy drops a lizard blood potion-I figured it would be nice to have a couple/few of these handy for those times when I'm sitting in Kunark or Velious and all those druids who beg me for a rez after their 30th quad-kite of the day went sour and they died, losing 1/20th of the exp they earned, are sitting anon (don't want to hear any defense on anon, either-I've been anon for a total of about 3 RL hours since I started playing this game) and won't give me a gate, no matter how insane my plat offer gets (/druidrant off). Go look up the info and ask around a bit...OK, agro greenies on the way down-I know it would take me a week to work my way down, so I pick up a couple invis potions and head down to CT. Zone in..ahh, noone over level 20 here, so I'm not going to be stealing any mobs from ppl who can get exp for them. Pop on my fishbone earring (I hate worrying about breathing underwater) and drop down the well. Kill a leezard fanatic to get the mudwater rune for that bard friend of mine who needs a lambent helm (picked up an oppaline helm doing my burgurgle camp). Pop invis and head down to the room. WOW-amazing luck-the cenobite is up! And hey, this room looks pretty cool. Hmmm-druid corpse here-I'll rez that poor soul once this cenobite is dead, assuming they're on-line. Sit down on the back wall and med. Get to FM. Retribution, sound of force and root loaded? Check. Divine aura, celes, remedy, gate loaded? Check. Pull with sound of force, trying to see how many HP this guy has. Ahh-took him to 80% life, two retributions should finish the job. Wait for stun to end so he doesn't die next to those three agro greenies standing nearby. Root/nuke (root breaks, of course). He heals. Hmm-gonna take more than two retributions to finish him-s`OK, still above 80m. He closes to melee range-WTF-doubles me for 56, 78, interrupts my nuke and my root and cast wrath for 126 on me, then heals again...blah blah-getting long here. Basically, the end of this fight is: I'm OOM (as in, enough mana to cast DA, but not enough for gate), 20h and running like a scared pup, this guy is following me(after stopping to heal himself, of course). I get bumped into the water by a lizard and can't get back on the boards. He follows and as soon as DA drops, hits me a few times for 50-80 damage and I'm dead.<P>So...how the HELL does a 35 cleric hit for 5-7 times what I can and have more mana than me (at 195 WIS and +300 mana-remember, I was OOM and he was still casting happily away-oh yeah, he had buffed himself and the three other lizards about a minute before I pulled) when I'm a 51 cleric?? At the very least, his melee damage should be on par with mine-I would have probably kill him if he hadn't been able to hit me (usually doubles) for 50+ every time he got in range. And fast enough to stop my 1.75 cast time stun and 3 second cast time root more than once. Not to mention the fact that I would be a DEEP red con to him, so he shouldn't have really been able to hit me, anyway. When's the last time you were able to get more than, say, 1 in 20 hits on a mob 16 levels higher than you? If VI wants to make clerics suck in melee, then make them all suck-don't make the NPCs as good or better than PC warriors.<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender <BR>Vicar of the 51st Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR>Master Drinker (200) Master Fletcher (178)Master Brewer (175) Master Jeweler (171)Master Potter (168) Master Smith (165) Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??)

Especially the first part where You describe the problem in a wider scope. Couldn't agree more.<P>I was pretty vocal back when there were class discussions up on Verants message boards. Things looked good and I really thought something would happend... but as we all know we got nada. Zilch.<P>Here's what I wanted us to have back then (and still do to this very day).<P>Better defense: <BR>Raised defensive caps - dodge, AC.<P>Better melee: <BR>Yes Dakthur. I know You wrote "There is no / none/ zero/ zilch justification for having better melee skills for a cleric." I can think up a few.<P>We are a plate class. We are meant to be right there, in the thick of it. (Note: But what do we do? We sit on our behinds and meditate.) We can wield powerful weapons (ie. good stats) but can we hit anything with these wonderful weapons?<P>Nope.<P>Someone put it like this back on the class discussions on Verants message boards - "We can't hit the broad side of a planet!"<P>I think it says it all. I don't even carry a mace anymore. All I try to do is to get as much AC as possible (I am way over 200 in wis) since I get beat into a pulp in record time - and I am in full ToV/Kunark armor?<P>All I want to do is to be able to get one good swing in there per 'battle round'. One. As it is now I get up and melee to get a few laughs. Some giggles from the group... and this gets old fast.<P>That's pretty much all I want. Better defense and raised 1hb and 2hb skills and I want this because I think it fits the class (in every day 1 group settings, mind You. Leave the big MOBs to the big tanks). No double or triple swings, no kicks...<P>Even if we did get those improvements we'd probably still be medding full time but at least we would have an option on how to play the cleric (and not be set into a premade mould).<P>Have a goodie<P>/Pirmin<BR>Valoran<BR>Karana<P>PS: I agree - bash would be nice too.

</FONT><HR>Ketocon felt the need to dismiss my suggestions rather rudely while failing to offer any of his own(Ketocon's remarks are in captions), so here's my reply: <P>Defensive skill - (want more ac get better gear) <BR><< I was the first Cleric in EQ to get 1300ac unbuffed, currently I have 1401 ac self buffed(aego AoP). Against mobs that flurry, stun, rampage, summon, and hit for 500+ and aggro you off the first CH, a defensive skill would be very nice. DA is ok, but it was nerfed to provide less aggro reduction, and summoning mobs will usually summon you when DA wears off if you are low health. (btw, the mobs i'm referencing here are Ancient Sentries in ST...these are common mobs mind you, and not anywhere NEAR as hard on clerics as the named Golems in the zone) >><BR>2. Dodge skill cap raised -(wanan dodge better be a war, monk, whatever)<BR><<No, I want to live to do my job which is healing. See above.>><BR>3. Limited duration increased mana efficiency skill -(Isnt that was specialize is for?)<BR><<Have you done the math on the mana savings that specialization gives? Well I have, and its approx 5%. A little more won't hurt.>><BR>4. limited Duration mana regen skill -(Clarity plz)<BR><<Every other caster class gets some form of limited self mana regen. It won't break the game if we get one too, it'll just make us slightly more efficient.>><BR>5. INVIS! just give us the spell for crying out loud!-(had to insert this here for visibility -(stop being lazy and camp a larrinks mask)<BR><<Larrikan's Mask is lore, and I have gone  through one in a day before with the amount of mobs I need to invis past.>><P>These suggestions come from my viewpoint as an "Uber Guild" member experiencing the so called "End Game" of EQ. However, these suggestions would be helpful for clerics of all levels. <P>BTW...5 posts and no server/level listed either....If you're going to flippantly dismiss ppl's posts you can at least let people know your lvl, server and guild.

</FONT><HR>Mobs are always more powerful the players, regardless (mobs are made for group encounters, not one on one).

Now, go to Chardok, and count how many of the wizard Sarnak's do that very thing. <P>Comparing apples and oranges there.<P>Clerics are the best healers in the game, period.

You ever drop a Comp Heal on the MT/ MA before he draws enough aggro to counteract it?  *You will not evade me Dahktur!!*  Or, in younger levels, on those same bad pulls, you dropped a superior heal right away on the tank, and the two unmezzed mobs come up to get close and personal?  THAT is the reason we wear plate, to help offset the fact we may just get beat on ALOT for the aggro associated with healing (NOT with tanking).   Plate is not a determining factor to *doing / being a tank*.  Rangers and Rogue cant wear higher then chain, and Monks cant wear higher then leather.   Plate armor is given to Clerics to help them survive heal aggro, not to give them the ability to go melee'ing mobs.<P>All classes have weapon skills they can use.  (Pure casters get piercing, 1h blunt, 2h blunt... Druids get 1h slash, 1h blunt, 2h blunt, ..etc, etc).. But this is more about surviving the earlier levels, then it is about producing any sort of quantifiable dmg by melee'ing?  (When was the last time POST 50, that you seen a wizard, druid, mage (not his pet), etc produce ANY real dmg by meleeing?  Probably never, and why?  Cause their jobs are to nuke, nuke/ buff/ heal/ dot/ snare, nuke/ pet dmg).<P>Again, I'm sorry, but those seeking melee skills are wanting increases in skills that will not help the cleric in his grouping/ raiding life what so ever.  If you are bored and fm in a group, nuke.  Reason we have those.  Some on comparable dmg (though longer casting time) as wizard nukes.<P>Again, no/ none/ zilch/ zero reason to have better melee skills for a cleric   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Dahktur<BR>58 Templar<P>Khelbun<BR>52 Wizard<p>[This message has been edited by Dahktur (edited 10-21-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Let me clarify something.<BR>Dakhtur posted the following:<BR>"THAT is the reason we wear plate, to help offset the fact we may just get beat on ALOT...Rangers and Rogue cant wear higher then plate, and Monks cant wear higher then leather.

Give a monk 1300ac and a cleric 1300ac and the monk will survive a beating much easier than a cleric. The ac is relative, what gives tanks the edge in dmg avoidance/absorption is Skill caps and Disciplines. At the high end of the game, clerics are put on the frontline against mobs that can level them in literally 1 second. We have gotten no raise in defense, or dodge. We haven't gotten any new skills or disciplines to help us deal with this. Meanwhile tanks have received new skills (Parry Riposte) new disciplines (defensive, evasive etc) to help them deal with this new class of mobs. Clerics have much higher ac armor available to us now, but so do tanks. Without the corresponding skill cap raises or disciplines we are unable to keep the same lvl of survivability we once had.<P><BR><P>------------------<BR>Seolta the Strategist<BR>Drunken Mick of the 60th Pint<BR>Blood of the Spider<BR>The Rathe - Team Powerfire<BR>http://www.drow.org</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hmm, that made me think of something..<P><B>Divine Haven</B>: a clerical discipline triggered by the player that would for a certain duration (10 minutes?) enable a DA effect automatically if the cleric had taken 50% of his or her hp in damage. The invulnerability would have no icon but be otherwise identical to DA/DB. The discipline would be burnt if the caster didn't take enough damage during the 10 minutes.<P>Having 2 DA's is all but useless to me in most high end hunts. Yes I have them hotkeyed but lag and the huge melee damage of some of those critters still makes it rare I can mash the button fast enough to save my butt and use up the last bit of mana I have left.<P><B>Invisibility</B> or make potions stackable. Maybe make the stackable version cost twice as much so lower levels don't misuse it. If it's so trivial to go get a larrikan's or wait on someone that can cast it then making this change would be trivial as well :P<P><B>Divine Concentration</B>: Another disc, good duration (10 minutes?) that makes every spell cast pass the specialization roll.<P><B>Power of Ale</B>: A discipline that makes all non-dwarf clerics as hardy, battle-toughened, and powerful as dwarven clerics are. Oh nevermind...too powerful. Scratch that one.<P><B>Increase defensive skills</B>: from 200 to 205, maybe even 215 or 220 from level 51 to 60. It's absurd that a level 40 npc can pretty much do the same damage to me now as it could over a year ago. I say that because when I've pulled for my warrior I'd take significantly more damage in the same amount of time as he would with his back turned (dodges only, no riposte or parry) even though I have almost 300 more AC than he does. <P>------------------<BR>Derenath Enikinteel<BR>60 Dwarven Cleric<BR>Zebuxuruk<BR>-=Bah yer na' 'urt, walk it off =-<p>[This message has been edited by Derenath (edited 10-22-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>There is only thing I can think of that would make EQ more enjoyable at the present time.  Change death so that when people die, they keep all their equipment and return to their bind spot.  Tag the person with an icon similar to rez effects so that they can receive a rez to recover lost experience.  One icon for each death in the case of multiple deaths.  The icons would disappear when the timer runs out.<P>CR is an ugly aspect of EQ.  It is not part of the challenge.  It is not entertaining.  It has no roleplay aspect.  CR is nothing but a time sink.  Verant has built an entire part of the game play around CR with corpse summons, etc.  End this aspect of EQ and the enjoyment factor would rise significantly.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Interesting stuff. Thought I'd throw in my 2cp...<P>There are 3 core issues all casters face...<P>1. Post 50 mana regen is broken. With mana pools able to grow by as much as 2000 mana after level 50 this issue needs redress in the form of either a new skill or a new line of spells for casters that do not have some decent form of mana regen already.<P>2. Mana pools are a "blue line" that becomes increasingly inaccurate as the mana pool grows. With over 3000 mana, I can cast 1 remedy and see one sliver vanish. A second one, however, will take me down half a bubble. Don't even get me started about guessing when I can cast my next heal when medding from OOM. We NEED to be told a number value like HP is.<P>3. Fizzle rates. Not as big an issue as it once was but still something that deserves attention. Once, long ago, Gordon let slip that all spells have a 5% chance to fizzle. When you add in the fizzle penalty for casting new spells (yes, it has been reduced) it adds up to casters fizzling on high mana spells. Post 55 casters need to have a reduction in the base fizzle rate. Down to, say, 2% and the elimination of the new spell casting fizzle rate.<P>Now to the cleric stuff...<P>I have to agree with Brodder. Clerics deserve a good, hard look without the "group benefit" magnifying glass.<P>One such issue has been the lack of <B>equal</B> deity specific benefits. Look at Tunare worshipers. They have a set of planar questable armor. No other religion is offered one. Indeed, the items that can be obtained are some of the best in the game. It was exceptionally disappointing.<P>As a cleric of Prexus, I have 1 newbie quest, one broken newbie quest, no deity Symbol, a half baked set of questable Erudite clr/pal armor whose only real restriction is that it requires good faction in the Temple of Prexus to get (something that pretty much any Erudite can do), and an imbue spell for a rare drop gem that only other worshippers can make use of.<P>I know I'm not alone. Many other religions are in the same boat. The only thing that seems to make Tunare any better is that High Elves are the most popular race for clerics and the dev team built Tunare's plane, the Plane of Growth.<P>So I either accept that as a cleric of Prexus I am pretty much forsaken by the deity I worship or hope that there will be a Plane of Oceans added to EQ. Something tells me Verant isn't going to make 10 or so planes for all the religions and we've already noted that DE clerics get no benefits from PoH and CT Erudites get no benefit from PoF. So even if a plane is put in I have no guarantee that I'd get any benefit from it. (side note, Plane of Decay apparently isn't going to open since Karanas are cured and Plane of Underfoot in the Hole looks to be the next plane to be opened)<P>If Verant really wants to equalize everything, here's my 2cp.<P>First, make a series of quests that start with Initiate and work up to the planar level piece. It wouldn't be hard to make them require journey to a plane to finish. Each quest would requite the item from the last step (a la Shawl and Dain Ring quests)<P>Second (and Brodder mentioned it) Deity specific spell lines.<P>Lastly (and I don't expect this but it would be cool if they did it) make the last item something that LOOKS unique. Something that screams "I worship this deity!"<P>As to the melee...<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Again, I'm sorry, but those seeking melee skills are wanting increases in skills that will not help the cleric in his grouping/ raiding life what so ever. If you are bored and fm in a group, nuke. Reason we have those. Some on comparable dmg (though longer casting time) as wizard nukes.<P>Again, no/ none/ zilch/ zero reason to have better melee skills for a cleric<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I think you are a bit mistaken. Let me give you a reason why to melee vs nuking...<P>I recently got into PoM. VERY cool zone. Had only a warrior and sometimes a pally to help kill stuff. Now, without mana regen I'm hard pressed to keep mana up. Even with Templar's Leggings and a Donal's BP it's not easy. I have Reckoning. 675 damage for 250 mana. But my mana is at a premium and I can't outmed him so I stand up and melee. With an epic, 108 strength, 200 Offense and 175 1hB I can hit for an average of 30-40 with 56 being my median high (have hit for 76 on one rare occasion). Over the course of the fight I can add several hundred damage without spending a single point of mana.<P>Also helps when you CAN'T LAND MAGIC SPELLS. Remember, we are 100% Magic nukers. The skills we have are sufficient for level 50 but are lacking post 50. I can't see any reason not to add another 25 points to 1hB and give us 75 points in Bash. Remeber, Bash is a stun and given that it's darn near impossible to land a stun nowadays that would come in VERY handy. <P><B>Defense caps...</B><P>We're the most defensive casters there are. Yet Shamen (chain class) can pretty much match us in the AC dept. I think an increase to 225 isn't out of line.<P><B>Spells...</B><P>I want MoK back to its original form OR an upgrade offered at say level 59. To tell dual wielding melees that they should take twice as much damage on mobs with damage shield but to tell them they shouldn't get any benefits from dual wielding on a reverse one is ludicrous. Original form... 10 hp per hit and benefits BOTH HANDS.<P>I would like to see the Donal's BP rolled back to 20 seconds since it now suffers a double nerf.<P>I want Aegis or BoF on the Velious BPs OR as the effect on the Crazy Cleric BP. And make a way to recharge the CC armor set that requires going back to PoM. Would make all the PoM armor something worth having.<P>We still need a group AC buff. Group SHoW at 53 or 54 or something like that.<P>The cleric pet needs something changed. I REALLY liked the suggestion to make the pet immune to AE spells and up the HP a bit (say to 300 or so) so the pet only dies when it becomes agro.<P>I would like to see a cleric fire based DD spell. It's not out of line with the idea of a cleric and Paladins get a fire based DD already. Maybe even a fire based stun.<P>Clerics need a new set of resists. Would love to see a long lasting +40 sv all spell for clerics so we don't have to keep rebuffing people with level 34-44 spells. Another note, paladins and rangers and even SKs have at least 1 Resist spell by the time they hit 60 and druids and shamen get group resist spells that are better than our single targets. Also makes people choose which resists they want...<P>Ultimately would love to see a single target +55 resist set put into the game, not only for clerics but shamen and druids as well.<P>Improve the Death Pact/Divine Intervention group. ESPECIALLY if it's going to be a SoL SKILL?!?! It fires too infrequently, costs too much (in both mana and reagents) and doesn't heal enough HP to make a difference. Needs at least a boost to the fire % and 2-3 times HP return of what it is now.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Donals has the buffs on the armor, albeit valor/aof/naltron.  I'm happy that the clickable velious armor gets use, even if the results are of questionable worth.  BoF/Aegis on a templar bp would get no real use.  Let's keep the buffing on the donals armor and off the velious armor.  It's obtainable in the low 50's when clerics are levelling and not casting aegolism.  Yeah I realize clerics don't always cast aegolism, but I click my bp daily and run across a 60 druid in group maybe once every four months.  The moderate amount of mana saved when the group is formed would be more than broken by the increased rebuff rate and peridot use for marzin's short duration.  For what it's worth I do use my velious bracers/boots/legs/bp every single day.  The velious armor has utility.  The buffing pieces of the donal armor (except gloves) got marginal use.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think the problems that irritate most clerics are the ones that irritate most long time players.  If they address the issues we find most frustrating for everyone, they'll take a lot of the monotony and frustration out of the game.<P>For instance, travel.  After playing for 2 years the issues surrounding travel are just incredibly irritating.  I've played a porting class and a non-porting class.  When I play my druid, I'm irritated by people begging for ports.  By the time you get to level 60 you should have the ability to instantly teleport yourself to any zone in the game.  I'm sure high level druids would love it too, they're as sick of porting people as people are of asking for ports.<P>Tradeskills:  put some effort into making them useful and make high-level tailoring a possibility without the current, almost impossible path.<P>Epics:  Get rid of them or redesign them.  I'm sick of epic fever and everyone wanting their epics, no matter how difficult it is to acquire or how lousy the actual epic is.  For gods sake, don't ever put anything even remotely like epic weapons into the game again.<P>Make CR easier, make summon corpse potions or something a possiblity.  CR in EQ sucks.  And having to do CR is places where a dungeon ate your body, because of the lousy CS reps don't respond to petitions, is even worse! <P>Add more bind points for meleers!<P>Cleric specific:  Well, handle those ones and I'll be a much happier camper.  But having some bobble drop in game for invisbility (unlimited) would make me velly happy.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>People find it difficult to travel through greenies!  Jeez what are you doing.  I find it easier to travel through zones with my cleric than my druid.  As a 50+ cleric you will usually either have either jboots, tboots or sow potions.  Secondly my main travel spell is invoke fear.  I can't remember the last time this was resisted (even feared a goon in OT the other week which was kinda funny)<P>Other very useful spells are soothe ( lowers aggro range for any who didn't bother to buy it, like harmony but resistable), root and atone.  I actually used a combination of these the other day to get into chardok without using invis or training the zone in.  Simply soothe, if resisted and they attack root back away and atone them then assist to see if it cleared aggro and I had to atone at most two times on these 35+ mobs.<P>Invoke fear is by far one of the best spells for travelling through outdoor zones imo.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think an important question to ask here is the following.<P>Are clerics overpowered in the end raiding game?<P>If the answer to that is yes (which I believe it is) then we are faced with A) Asking for improvements that woudl further overpower us or B) ask for improvements that wont make us better at the main task but improve other aspects.<P>If opting of A (or not believing we are overpowered) I would suggest a few things.<P>1) Remove the 200 wis cap for mana - actually making high end gear worthwhile. I have 262 wisdom without using a single piece for the wisdom and without truly uber gear. Doesnt matter for small grouping really - but would surely improve CH rotation performances.<P>2) Give us a /disc manaregen to double our regen for a short time - but only useable every 72 mins. Again, perfect for killing that one uber mob where mana would otherwise run out.<P>3) Give us an insta-DA skill (seems we are getting that and a 36 sec one too). Aggro from casting the first CH? No problem with this baby.<P>4) Give us better defensive skills - again for when that heal aggros and we want to survive to use the rest of our mana pool.<P>The question just is - did we make overselves even more overpowered doing so (read CH-rotation).<P>Seolta - I hate those golems in ST too. Often it seems we take more deaths in clerics to those than we do in others for the entire raid  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Well, not true, but they do like to summon the first cleric to cast and they stun an awful lot  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P><BR>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=9406" TARGET=_blank>Mikar Vicarious</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 10-23-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>my biggest problem with the game is mob-flation. VI keeps going off about how it's risk versus reward so why do we work our arses off to get to level 60 only to get smoked by every level 40 creature that crosses our path? The whole game is broken. They should have based each monster off of the character classes (except special/named mobs) with average equipment. Named mobs could be special encounters and make them have any7 numbers and stats they need to but to make a level 40 caster barehanded hit you for 80HPs is retarded. it should be an equal playing turf for the players. If they need to make a dragon level 100 to make it a tough encounter then fine, but a level 50 dragon against a level 60 ANY other class should be do-able solo! By the time any character gets to level 60 they should be on par with gods and dragons, they've worked hard enough for it so give it to them. If they need harder monsters don't make characters less tough, make monsters more powerful.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
