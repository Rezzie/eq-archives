<br />
Thanks for giving us the funnest spell I have ever used, namely the summoned hammer, and then nerfing it over night.  What, exactly, is the point of your Test Server?  You make all these changes on test, and then bring them to live, only to nerf them on live??  I dont understand, why dont you just call Test, &quot;piss people off&quot; server, so that you can make changes on it to piss people off, and then put them live so people get all excited, and then get rid of the changes.  Cause that is basically what you have done.  My hammer is proccing around once every 20 hits now, that is roughly the same as every other weapon in the game I believe.  Are clerics really *so* overpowered that we cant even be allowed to solo greens reasonably?  Thanks a lot, guys.</div></div><hr />
