<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">02-14-2000, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a debate that I've been having with myself, and I'm not coming up with any positive answers.<br />
<br />
Being lvl 43 now, and literally living in Sol B where everyone knows I'm a lvl 43 cleric, I have begun getting 5-10 requests for resses per hour.  Let me state now that I have NO problem with ressing a person in a heart beat when I'm not in a group.. heck one night I did 11 in one hour, and poor Rayne had to res me once during those because I was killed by LDC's *grin*<br />
<br />
The issue is what do I say when I'm in a group.  I've had more then one occassion I've said yes, and we've ended up with a train, and if I had not used my mana on the res, it could have been used during that train, and someone in my group wouldn't have died.  When I am in a group, I feel my mana is for that group, and not for others.  I am responsible to them, and they rely on me to keep them alive if something hits them.  I am the main healer, and that is what I should be doing... but I've been called a b**ch for thinking this way.  I was told by one individual that I was being 'stingy' and by another that I was a fing w*ore.  Saying &quot;No&quot; to a person sometimes means that you are going to get curse words or insults thrown at you... saying yes could mean your group dies, and ignoring the request... I won't even go into the response I've gotten from doing that.<br />
<br />
I've tried charging... and if anyone in my group dies because I don't have enough mana to heal them cuz I ressed, well they get the cash.  I've asked for buffs, or clarity, but this doesn't always work, as the person isn't even in the zone, and isn't going to have mana when they are ressed.<br />
<br />
I guess my way of thinking is that I don't run up to the shaman in the middle of a battle and say &quot;SOW ME&quot; when they aren't even in my group.  I don't run up to the warrior and say PULL FOR ME when they aren't in my group.  I have requested clarity from enchanters... ONLY if they are able, and I always always offer to pay, either with PP or the pages (or is it words) that they need (they always accept the words).  And I never insult them when they say no.  So why is my &quot;craft&quot; any different then someone elses?<br />
<br />
What do you guys/gals do?  <br />

Good to see you here, you sure blew by me in levels.<br />
<br />
It is a tough problem you face, but to me it boils down to one thing - if I am in a group, my job is to keep them alive. Anything else is secondary. If I don't keep them alive, and they aren't my guildbrothers, I may have a hard time getting in a group later. That would be bad. (grin)<br />
<br />
Before bringing someone back from the dead, if I am in a group - I check with them to see if we are OK. (And usually try to get a clarity to make up for it). If they aren't comfortable with what it will do with my mana, I will politely decline.<br />
<br />
When people start getting unpleasant - I simply ask them, If you were in my group and died because I ressed someone else instead of healing you, how would you feel?<br />
<br />
It usually brings them up short (not that I have had to do that that much).<br />
<br />
Plus, I can just let my friends know who is harassing me, and they will voice their displeaure to the people giving me a hard time.<br />
<br />
By this time in the game, we clerics tend to have a few lv 50/well known patrons....<br />
<br />
No real ideal solution to jerks though. (But if they are using the language you say - then you should Immediately /report them). At least Mennix in the past took a dim view of such things....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">By-Tor</div><div class="date">02-14-2000, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I do is tell them to wait a bit for you to get mana.  I then ask my party if its ok if I go res someone, and for them to stop pulling while I go res.  Sure it adds to down time (10 min I guess) but its better to be safe than sorry.  I never go res during pulls, I wait till a lull and go do it.<br />
<br />
If the person who requested the res is impatient (or just a jerk who responds with insults) just dont res them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">02-14-2000, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think what really bites about this is that 2 hour limit on resses. They expect clerics to free themselves up from groups to go run halfway across the world to res someone. I love helping people, but sometimes getting out isn't that easy. I always ask tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garrum</div><div class="date">02-14-2000, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can relate to this.Last night I was in Feerrott with my enchanter buddy and a necro he had met.The thing was ,I had been in greater faydark,and my buddy had paid 60pp for a tele for me.<br />
<br />
After about 45 minutes in Feerrott i get a tell asking for a res.Not a res in the Rathe mountains,nor in Innothule swamp,not even on Antonica.I get a request to res someone in LESSER FAYDARK!They are offering 50pp for the service,which isnt bad money by any means.But I tell them about how my friend paid for my tele and I didnt want to waste his money and that I was in a group besides.Then they offer 100pp.I tell them again that I cant break the group up to res them,and that maybe they should try to find a cleric on Faydwer.Then they offer 200pp.I tell them that they could get a res far cheaper from a cleric on the same continent,and that I was sorry,but i wasnt going to leave my group to res them.I guess they started asking around there because I got no more tells.<br />
<br />
Were all the clerics on Faydwer too busy killing dwarves to res them?Or was it just easier to ask a cleric on the other side of the whole world to res them?Who knows.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">02-15-2000, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My strategy on this is fairly simple:<br />
<br />
If I'm not grouped, then I'll almost always revive the requestor.  I don't ask for cash, but I'll generally accept anything given to me  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
If am grouped, however, I'll tell the requestor that I can't abandon my group (which is true), but if they can get someone to drag the corpse to me, I'll be happy to revive them when I can safely spare the mana.<br />
<br />
I've found people to be generally OK with this...<br />
