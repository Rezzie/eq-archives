Top of the list choice here   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>1.) Clerics have one trick that they do SO well that the game now revolves around it.  For level 60 clerics, gear doesn't really matter beyond a certain point.  There's nothing Verant can give us to make us better at what we do, because we're already as good as we need to be to do what we do best.  Because we're so good at what we do (Raid), Verant seems to ignore the glaring fact that we are unable as a class to even participate in the rest of the game.  At level 60, most melees can get gear that allows them to effectively solo XP mobs with minimal downtime.  The same can be said of most of the caster classes, but clerics continue to be dependant upon their mana and inefficient combat spells.<P>Clerics need to be given some diversity and utility across the lifetime of the character.  Since the solo classes have been given serious refits regarding their raid ability, why is it so difficult to give clerics a little more utility in the solo arena?  Why is it that to be effective and have fun as a cleric outside of raids at 60, I have to second-box a warrior partner?<P>2.) Clerics need an upgrade.  See above.  As for the other classes, I see a few minor issues here and there, but I think that some of those issues could be resolved by making across-the-board caster changes.  All classes need to change in scope from 50-60 the way melee classes do.<P>3.) I think most of the casters are in the same boat.  Most of us are pretty well balanced, but in comparison to the way melee classes scale in the end game, we just don't rate.<P>4.) If I could pick ONE thing that could be changed about clerics...  there isn't any one thing.  We're a balanced class as far as any one thing goes, but there are several minor things that I think we can ask for.<P>First, make our undead DOT's a little more efficient.  Give us an undead snare.  Give us the ability to put some of our utility spells together to good effect.  <P>Second, up our defense.  We're a plate class.  It's ridiculous to think that with full plate armor and my healing spells, I can take hits less effectively than a shaman (Of course, this is because the shaman has slows)<P>Make our pet static.  Come on, druid pets didn't unbalance the game.  Why would leaving our hammer up between fights break the game?<P>Scale our combat abilities better.  No, we're not a melee class.  I'm not asking for kick, bash or duel weild, but when I swing my hammer, let me hit a bit more than I do.<P>Now some of these things sound silly to you guys.  You think I'm abandoning what it means to be a cleric, but frankly, I know what it is to be a good cleric.  I'm level 60.  I raid all the time.  What I want out of the game now is the ability to relax between raids, goof around, maybe even snag a little solo XP here and there.  It dissapoints me that for all of my gear and experience, going solo is nothing but a hassle.<P>Borick Ascid<BR>High Priest Of Brell<BR>Noble Blade<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think the number one problem is we are considered to be a casting class. This places a focus on our spells and everyone ignores anything else we should be able to do.

</FONT><HR>Other classes first:<P>A) Remove the pet exp penalty.<BR>B) Fix pathing somehow - even if indirectly by making pets indiff as the mages suggest.<BR>C) Give druids a 4khp, 12sec, 600mana heal with a 60sec recast time.<P>For clerics:<P>A) Make our undead dot do damage ala Splurt.<BR>B) Give us a "JBB" that only works vs undead. Make it drop from something nasty. Say Arch Lich - or if thats too hard then THO or even Rhag2.<BR>C) Give us a self only 25pt DS vs undead. Make it a spell or innate AA ability.<BR>D) Change the range of Turn Undead to 70 feet.<BR>E) Make our pet hammer stay around. Not like it doesnt die fast anyway. <P>With the exception maybe of TU this wont change anything for our raid power - it will moderately help us in non-ae groups - and it will make it viable for us to solo should we so desire. In short it would add more options to us without making us even more overpowered raid wise.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal<P>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 03-04-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 03-04-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I don't know about the pet exp thing. Giving any class an expendable tank that can do most of the work and give all the credit to their master seems a bit over the top. Currently, if the pet does 51%+ of the total damage, the pet eats 50% of the exp in SOLO situations. If the pet class is grouped the pet doesn't eat exp. Seems perfectly equitable to me.<P>As to what clerics and others need...<P><B>Melee</B><P>I constantly boggle at these new cleric only weapons with really good damage/delay and wonder "Does Verant know we still can't hit the broad side of a barn?"<P>Priests are capped at 175 in Blunt melee skills. Not sure what shaman/pure caster piercing and druid 1hS cap at but all cap WELL below even hybrids. It's a left over from the old world. When 50 was the cap, being able to melee at the same level as a level 45 character made sense. In the post 50 world it makes no sense. Even hybrids have been moved up to appropriate levels.<P>The reason is was never changed? Melee classes whined we should be dependant upon our spells for damage...<P>At the very least, priests need their 1hB, piercing, and 1hS raised to 200+. Pure casters need to be able to push piercing past 200 as well. Honestly, I would like to see us all be raised to 225 or even 250. This would not infringe upon melee at all. Melee classes have the benefit of multiple weapon types (1hB, 2hB, 1hS, 2hS) as well as focusing their stats on melee related stats (str, dex, agi) and having secondary melee abilities (dodge, parry, riposite). A cleric with 225 1hB  and the best melee cleric weapon will NEVER outperform even a paladin with appropriate equipment.<P>We also need our Dodge skills raised from 75 to somewhere in the 150-200 range. This is something we were asking for even before Kunark. Priests, being classes that get beat on, need the higher cap.<P><B>General Casting issues</B><P>There needs to be a way to lower the 2.5 recast time ALL spells have. Either as a benefit for leveling (ie post 50 or post 55) or as an AA skill. The recast time is absurd in the post 50 realm is absurd. Again, it is a leftover vestage from the old world. It makes sense for lower level casters but in the higher areas the abilitiy to chain cast heals is important. Either this needs to be across the board or limited to utility and heal spells.<P>Mana pool NUMBERS. Alan stated they were rethinking this but they were still divided. My question is why are casters denied one of the most important pieces of information? Moreover, why are high level casters with large mana pools forced to GUESS what their mana is? Melee classes are told everything about melee damage, delay, etc... why not casters? The roleplay argument is old and worn out. This isn't about roleplay, this is about treating casters as equals and removing the only remaining barrier to our efficiency.<P><B>Priest issues</B><BR>There is a gaping hole in the post 50 realm for heals. Clerics get their last real heal upgrade at 53 with the final HoT spell coming at 59.<P>There is a need for a 1k+ heal. Clerics get it at 55 and the other 2 at 60. 100 range 400 mana cost 5.0 second cast.<P><B>Cleric issues</B><P>Divine Light needs its radius increased to 200 to match Nature's Touch (60 dru).<P>Judgement needs its damage upgraded to match the damage/mana ratio of Reckoning. No clerics will currently use Judgement over Reckoning. And no, it's not worth it for the instant recast time.<P>Make the 54 pet useful as a melee DoT instead of a 600 mana sink. Absor discussed several promising ideas about this over a year ago. Mainly make the pet immune to AE spells and up its HPs slightly so it would be able to go and do damage and only die if it became agro. At present it dies on the first hit most of the time. Perhaps remove the suicide component and make it a lower level enchanter type pet.<P>Give us more useful CLASS AA skills. At present, only Mass Group Buff and Bestow Divine Aura are useful. <P>My suggestion is a class AA skill that would make cleric buffs undispellable. Would have a 72 min reuse time and possibly work with MGB. Given how much we burn on reagents, this would give us a way to save at least SOME money. Would also give clerics a unique and useful skill.<P>Reduce the reuse on Divine Resurrection (class AA skill) from 60 game days (72 hours RL) to something more palatable like 20 game days (24 hours RL).<P>Increase Celestial Regeneration (class AA skill) to 1k per tick.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with everyone that our melee and casting skills are lacking. At level 59 I shouldn't go Oom trying to kill some green mob that has no business attacking me in the first place. The new AA skills that melee classes get has left us helpless for exp. Sure we can solo but it isn't even worth the time with our current mana to damage ratio. It seems to me every class in eq now has the ability to solo except for cleric's. <P>I enjoy grouping for exp we are not a solo class and I don't expect for us to be made one. I am just pissed that we are basically useless except for raids now. Oh and I can't forget about running around and ressing all of the soloer's that went ld when they pulled. I am a little bitter about logging in every night and lfg in guild chat and then some paly in the guild dings 100 while soloing and I still have no group. <P>Is it just me or do other people seem to have this problem? <P>------------------<BR><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36837">Binadint <BR> 59 Templar</a> <BR> <a target="new" href="http://www.solusekro.org/wwwthreads/wwwthreads.pl">Solusek Ro</a><p>[This message has been edited by Binadint (edited 03-04-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to see manastones allowed in most common zones in the new worlds. Not places like ToV or the planes. But in places like great divide.... We already have FT items and if there's a mage in the group we can use mod rods, which isn't the same but you get the point. And i'm not talking about making them drop again, just allow the ones already in the game to be of use again.<BR>MUCH better undead abilities, so we are finally the masters of undead. <P>Something that has been bugging me alot lately too is all the high levels coming back to lower level dungeons to get AA points, and 90% of the time doing it solo. I don't know how many times i've been in SolB and seeing high level monks soloing massive sections of the place. Either make it so clerics can solo WELL, or make it so AA points can only be gotten in certain zones or make it so you HAVE to be in a full group to get AA points or something like that. This is getting rediculous. More and more i'm logging on my warrior cause i can't find a group anymore. it's like being 24 again!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Mostly druid perspective here, though I do have a 42 cleric as well.  I basically see two issues, one having to do with healing and the other with boredom.<P>Healing is a two edged sword of sorts.  Cleric healing is so good that it's the only healing that matters on an end game raid.  Secondary healers are rapidly being marginalized to the point they can't even keep themselves healed, much less everyone else.  Druids definitely need better healing in the end game, and possibly shamen as well, though they have Torpor which is much better than Nature's Touch.  The question is how can that be done without infringing on clerics in non-raid situations.  <P>The answer that I believe may be forthcoming is that mobs may be adjusted so that they yield experience based on difficulty rather than just level.  Clerics would be required for the best experience groups in this case, since druid and shaman healing likely wouldn't be sufficient.  I have somewhat mixed feelings about this as my main is a druid.  Accept the truth or not, a group already takes an experience penalty for having a druid as a primary healer, and I don't like seeing that gap widened.  The gap comes from both more efficient healing on the part of clerics and on the cleric's ability to rez when things go bad.<P>Addressing matters on the boredom front is more difficult.  Clerics do have things they can do besides heal, of course.  They can nuke modestly, root park, stun, fear, mem-blur, and do a few other things as well.  The main issue I see here is that clerics aren't called on to do these things for a reason, and the reason isn't that they're bad at these things.  No, clerics aren't called on to do these things because they're expected to heal instead.  Adding something new for clerics to do may not help much.  I don't think better melee skills are the answer.  Priests, including clerics, are casters in the grand scheme of things.  The only reason melee would even enter into a cleric's mind as a reasonable possibility is because clerics have higher AC than all other magi and priests.<P> - Chronomis<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Play a 60 druid and 60 cleric here.<P>A)<BR>I think Clerics need a direct heal spell that bridge's the gap between Divine Light and Complete Heal.  Maybe a 2k Heal for 400 mana with a 5 second cast time.<P>Other then that, more utility spells, more along the line the the mark series.<P>B) Casters in general need an upgrade when compared to melee's .<P>Of the melee classes though, I think the SK's could use a few raid utility spells.  Paladins have Divine Str which is a nice hp buff additive, maybe SK's should have a group attk line to cast on raids.  <P>Druids- As a druid myself, downtime healing is probably the worst thing.  I would love a 4k heal spell for 600 mana even if the recast time was 2 minutes.  Druids are great for the easy low hp mobs like froggies in Sebilis, but over that I'll always be oom just trying to keep the main tank healed against something like a juggernaut.  <P>Melee's Discs- There are two types of disc's Defensive/Aggressive.  They need to unhook these two and make each on their own timer.  Add low level Defensive Disc for SK's and Paladins at 60 <P>Caster Discs- None atm, but really needed.  <P>Priest classes should receive:<P>Disc that doubles their healing output for say 2 minutes.  <P>Disc that doubles healing range, reduces cast time of spells by 1/2 for two minutes.<P>Caster classes should receive:<P>Disc that doubles their dd output for 1 minute.<P>Disc that reduces mana cost by 25% for 3 minutes.<P>Other priest/caster discs:<P>Casting Focus: For period of one minute, all spells will go through no matter what (meaning no fizzles, can't be interrupted regardless of stun or knockback or summon)<P>Mana Focus: For a period of two minutes, all spells will meet their specialization checks.<P>C)hrmm see above, heh<P>D)Take away the pet and give us a peridot that costs 5 pp instead of 10.5 =)<P>E)[What should be done about nasty dr00ds like me who steal the role of cleric in xp groups?!?]<P>The only time a druid can keep up effectively as healer is with low hp mobs.  That's why a cleric is rarely needed for xp groups like shrooms in FG but needed usually for a juggernaut run for instance.<P>They need to adjust risk vs reward vs xp on mobs.  A level mob that has 10k hp and hits for 225 regularly shouldn't give the same amount of xp versus a level 50 5k hp mob that hits occasionally for 120, it should give double.  This would create an opening of a good xp groups that really need the cleric for healing versus the druid.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have the exact same problem Binadint. With all our guilds NToV and ST enabled monks, rogues, wars, and even hybrids as well as casters ALL soloing, I have a real hard time finding a EXP group even within a 3 guild alliance. As far as pickup groups, heh forget it, the exp gain is so marginal, and the frustration so high, I am beginning to just log off instead of doing that. I have seen 1 lvl. 60 cleric quit EQ due to not being able to find a group and Vulak ascending. He was saving his ELP points for Vulak loot. <BR>Not only did they nerf the possiblilty of grouping regularly, they took away the best area to raid since no Vulak = no raid in our case, the other NToV mobs just are not worth the hassle if theres no Vulak at the end.<BR> WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SOLO!

</FONT><HR>My fix involves turning all clerics into druids and giving druids all our healing/ressing/buffing spells.  <P>Fixes 2 classes at once.  Druids will be wanted, even needed! in the end game and clerics can do more stuff and even solo.<P>When I first thought of this I was joking, but I've actually become fond of the idea.  I think the cleric class is doomed to high burn-out or people "botting" them because it is so narrow and so focused on healing.

</FONT><HR>Na, druids have enough of it already. A 60 druid with c2/c3 can already be primary healer for most exp groups, if he/she only focuses on healing and maybe snares via epic or many clickable items with snare they get. I would actually like to see most mobs in exp places like velks, seb etc. hit for 50% more than they hit now, because of all this new hp/ac gear, weapons, and melee AA skills. This will make cleric a must for most exp groups. I am tired of sitting there /LFG only because druid can heal AND do so many other things, which i cant.<P>Finally, i would like to see mage direct damage spells to be better than druid ones.

</FONT><HR>To sum up the basic general idea of what i'm seeing from these posts...<P>First, we want clerics to gain more diversity and ability to solo.  The most suggested ways to do this so far have been 1) Better combat skills 2) a MUCH more practical and useful pet (so we can heal it, and have it deal damage for us) 3) better spells to be used for solo'ing.  While this is in the area of damage spells, other spells that fill a 'niche' might be useful here as well such as better fears, roots, dots, etc.<P>Secondly, clerics are asking to add more to groups.  We feel we are incapable of keeping up with melees in a group, and now that melee skills and armor have become so powerful, we are no longer an 'essential' part of xp gaining, nor in some cases, even wanted at all.  Most melee can solo and even with downtime they are capable of gaining experience much faster.  Possible solutions to helping us in a group situation are damage shields, the MoR spell being more damaging and less resisted, but overall increased damage output. In this area, the class spell 'judgement' needs to be balanced for a better mana to damage ratio, though honestly, all of our spells (even undead ones) need to be rebalanced on this issue.<P>Thirdly, the issue of pressure on raids.  We are a 'raid essential' class and most likely the most essential on 90% of the high level encounters.  We would like to see some diversity in this field amongst other caster classes, or at least diversity in raiding strategies that work, that lessen this pressure and require maybe a few less clerics.  Many things in luclin and velious using the current strategies require as many as 6-8 clerics.  8 clerics on a 40 person raid is a 1:5 ratio.<P>Finally, the AAXP abilities are considered very poor for the class, and should be reviewed.  Only a handful are even worth getting at the moment. This is one of the weaker points of the class.<P>I hope this sums things up nicely, as i'm hoping that verant will see this thread.  I plan to point them in this direction if i can  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  So please, keep your input coming.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Somewhat off topic for this thread, but it deserves a reply.  Perhaps the answer will suggest something relevant to a cleric revamp.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Na, druids have enough of it already. A 60 druid with c2/c3 can already be primary healer for most exp groups<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>A cleric still does it better.  Since you're assuming C2/C3 for the druid, assume the same for the cleric.  The cleric group can sustain a much faster pull rate.  Basically a druid can heal for a group that isn't dealing with tough mobs under the circumstances described, but the group does pay a price for that.<P>To put it simply, clerics aren't hurting for experience groups because of the efficiency of druid healing.  If primary healer is the only consideration, groups do prefer clerics quite strongly, especially once rezzes are a factor.  Druids often do play the role of primary healer, but it's because of higher availability, not because of healing capability.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>if he/she only focuses on healing and maybe snares via epic or many clickable items with snare they get.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No druid worth his salt is going to be snaring with a right click item, except possibly the epic.  With the epic they'll be using it for the DoT, not the snare, and a druid is definitely in trouble healing if the mob lasts for full duration on that DoT (3 minutes).  Snare is a very cheap spell, not worth messing with a click item with an eternal casting time for.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Finally, i would like to see mage direct damage spells to be better than druid ones. I could never get it why druids nuke better than mages (their top nuke is not a bolt and with new 60 Luclin nuke they do more dmg than mages atm).<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I'll leave it for the wizards to call you on the details of that one.  Personally I wouldn't object to mages having a better nuke, but please don't frame it in such nerfage terms.  You would never know it to talk to mages, but mages actually do outnuke druids by a pretty substantial amount until the mid-50's.<P>Druids are basically the magi of the priest classes in EQ, by the way.  They have the lowest AC and the least healing capability.  It's reasonable for them to nuke better than any other priest class, and for those nukes to be pretty decent nukes.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>And btw, i also play lvl28 druid, which appears to be my main character now  No class envy here, just sober look at things which many seem to ignore.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Come back and read your post again when your druid is level 50, assuming you ever play your druid that far.  I doubt that you'll feel the same way.  Being stuck with the same heal at 50 that you got at 29 has an effect on your perspective, especially when you can't chain cast it fast enough to keep up with the damage mobs are doing.<P>Personally I wouldn't mind seeing the cleric class opened up a bit and having a more diverse set of capabilities.  However, the key problem with that is that clerics wield too much healing power.  Give clerics more to do in any reasonably balanced way, and clerics will <I>still</I> spend all their time healing and medding.  EQ is a game where you meet the demands of your group or your raid first, and meet your own desires second.  <P>I know I won't be popular saying this, but the best way for clerics to move forward when it comes to actually being a fun class to play is to give up some of the monopoly on healing in the high end game <I>in exchange for</I> a more diverse skill set.  Gaining the diverse skill set will either do very little for clerics or completely marginalize all the other priest classes, depending on just how much is given, so long as the monopoly on high powered heals is retained.<P> - Chronomis<P><p>[This message has been edited by Chronomis (edited 03-04-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Trust me, Quotisin, clerics are not vital in groups at level 60 any more than they were vital in groups at level 25.  Therein lies the problem.  We (Clerics) were satisfied to be utterly unable to solo effectively.  We didn't bitch a whole lot about our lack of utility, because we understood at the time that such was the price of our absolute ownership of the end game in groups and on raids. <P>Now we find that efficient healing and huge mana pools mean nothing when a tank has 1300+ AC, 6K+ hit points, regens 20 points per tick and can carve through blue mobs non-stop and only need to be topped off every two or three mobs by a shaman or druid.  A cleric in such a situation is nothing more than an XP sink, and in the AA game, that's all the tanks care about.<P> Druids asking for more healing?  Who cares.  The only thing keeping druids from getting better healing is the fact that those heals would unbalance their soloing options. Don't forget that druids/shamans have already HAD a bit of a rebalance back when Verant made that lip-service attempt at asking us what we wanted last year.  Of course, the whole balance issue turned out to be nothing more than a token effort to help cover up what they had already intended to do with or without our input.  Clerics didn't get aything but nerfed.<P>Verant needs to wake up. They're balancing the solo classes to be more like us, but they're not balancing US to be more like the solo classes.  <P>I'm sick of devoting my time to raiding, knowing that when I am awarded some really nice piece of loot, it's merely a token of appreciation by my guild, who would have been better off giving the item to a melee who would actually see an upgrade by getting it.<P>But, oooh, we have more flowing thought items now, and 'ancient spells'.  Flowing thought is better than a kick in the teeth, but it's not a definitive upgrade to our abilities.  As for the cleric ancient spells...  why is Verant making us better at doing something they already consider us overpowered at doing?  <P>Verant tweaks our ability to heal and buff, then negates that by making mobs that flurry and rampage, or cast silence, blind, knockback or curses that trash the very thing they've improved in us.  <P>We're already the kings of raids. Toss us a bone so that we can be versatile and needed in XP groups across our lifetime.  Give us options for soloing.  It wouldn't take much to do this, but merely give us some spell (Such as an undead snare) that would allow us to use the tools we already have.  The last time I cast a fear was when I was powerleveling my necromancer.<P>Borick Ascid<BR>High Priest of Brell<BR>Noble Blade<BR>The Rathe<p>[This message has been edited by Borick (edited 03-05-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>First off, VI needs to balance mobs, not balance their game by nerfing clerics.  Remove some of the MR from some of the high end mobs and we can nuke and stun and root again.  That would make me happy all by itself.  <P>Second, CH is not a game breaker unless the mobs have a gazillion hp and CH rotations are the only way to kill them.  Hmm, again, fix themobs, don't nerf the clerics.<P>Third, what clerics need is standing mana regen and/or some sort of mana regen spell.<P>What would a mana regen spell do for clerics?  Reduce downtime.  That would make the game more fun.  One thing VI has never figured out is that sitting around medding is not the most fun part of the game.  Doing stuff is more fun.  Allow us to regen mana while standing, and also, allow us to have a self only clarity type spell would be great.<P>Thanks<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Would be interesting if we could use aaxp for a type of small ae heal (with a large recast time of course =P  ).  <BR>Also I would change divine aura/divine barrior to include an invis portion.  On something like running through a zone to do a cr it would be nice.  The cleric's god should be able to do full protection on their loyal follower no problems =P<P>Never really understood how warriors can get so many utility spells off of items with unlimited charges though.  Seeing "a_warrior_36 begins to cast a spell" for invisibility is just wrong.  An item that will allow warriors to hide from mobs?  From an rp standpoint warriors should always want to face something head on.  Rogues would be ok for invis, since they're the sneaking type.  I just always thought warriors devoted all their time to physical power because they believed that magical power could not be trusted, and that it should not be used as a crutch because it was unreliable in the end.  I can't really think of one rp reason why VI would allow warriors getting to cast  spells.  *shrug  <BR>Yes, I can think of some reasons on how a warrior could work with something magical, but it is against their character to do so, which is my main problem with it.  <BR>Can anyone think of any rp support of why warriors are allowed to use these items?<P><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24725" TARGET=_blank>Aiyre Soulfyre</A> <BR>High Priest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Complete Heal has been a thorn in our side and yet it is something we hold onto for life. At this moment, if they took CH out of the game you'd be left with a class of third rate druids with res and high AC.<P>The problem is... we can't solo. But Verant hates soloing. They can't do a whole lot without making it obvious they're expanding our ability to solo because then all the other classes would fall upon VI with requests for expanded solo abilities as well.<P>So, what do we ask for? I thought long and hard about this. When it all boils down we really need the following 2 things for our class.<P>1. Something beyond Complete Heal. Our greatest problem is WHEN we do this<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>i'd like to see a strike..<BR>like all clerics staying of the game for a week or two... i wanna see what happens after that :P<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR>what happens next is we are replaced by a PLed twink who can do the job that a veteran cleric can just as well.<P>Our entire class revolves around this ONE SPELL. Hence, we are relegated to one role and thus we are easily replaced. It takes no skill to play a cleric anymore. So the veteran clerics with lots of /played time have no distinction between the PLed twinks who have maybe 10 or 20 /played days.<P>It's insulting, it's degrading and it makes those of us who have stuck with this class through thick and thin feel like a waste.<P>No other class in the game is replaced by twinks as easily as we are. Even enchanters  still require you to know the nuances of the class to play one well.<P>2. Make it so that groups with multiple clerics have a role for the other one. 2 druids? One nukes, the other heals. 2 Warriors? Both tank. 2 wizards? Both nuke. But 2 clerics? You can't overlap heals, your damage output is so heavily nerfed it might as well not even exist and you have no utility spells to throw into the mix.<P>A group with 2 clerics right now is wasting a spot. Groups won't even consider it unless there's nobody else. So most clerics rot at the zone with LFG on.<BR>------------------------<BR>The bottom line is this. Clerics need an offensive output increase. We need better nukes, a non-undead DoT (we're not only the only class without invis but the only one without a normal DoT as well), a melee increase and some saving throw for travel besides the unreliable root.<P>As to healing... well, the only true way to balance the healing would be to introduce % heals. But Verant cannot (or perhaps will not?) do this right now. So other classes are stuck with fixed heals.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I will speak from exsperiance. I don't do raid, and only group for exp. I have never had a problem getting a group. <P>I see little or no changes being done to the Cleric class. As we stand now, we are more usfull in a group then any other caster, with the exception of Enchanter. Even then I think we are equal to Enchanters in what we bring to a group.<P>We bring, Best Heals, Best HP/AC Buffs, and of course Lv 56 Rez... <P>This is about balancing classes. To do that one would have to conclude there is an inbalance. If thats the case, then we are on the heavy side of the scale with enchanters.<P>Just look at what they did with SK/Pallys ... the changes they made were done so that they could possibly find groups easier. The same will be done here for Wiz, Magis, Druids ... <P>Would I like to see more ability to solo... sure, but it aint gona happen my friends :-)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>For those of you that think we are so easily replaced by twinks or whatever on raids, there is an issue in your belief.  No veteran cleric = twink.  It isn't as easy as some people make it, it is more then just pushing ch every time it is your turn.  I as a veteran cleric watch for other clerics screwing up in rot, i heal others when they ask while still doing rot, i res when i know i have time to.  A twink cleric can not predict when they have time or mana to do this.  I know when to assist heal, i know when to drop a dl.  I can also aego and use mod rods and keep myself with good hp without causing any issues.  <P>So please don't say a veteran cleric can be easily replaced b/c that is not true.  <P>About our class i don't see much wrong really.  I would like our class aa skills revamped a bit atleast.  Make that free cast hot be atleast 2k hp or something.  Make it useful.  AE buff owns.<P>For people who think clerics are useless in groups well i can tell yuo this one thing.  I don't heal much in aa exp groups with guildies.  Full group i barely heal.  What i do is pull nuke, heal a bit, no enchanter i split up and root mobs and such.  We are very good pullers with run speed and mor pulling.  Run back to group before mob gets to you, you pull like 4, root one just as it hits camp so you only have 3 on you now <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif">.  I been masterying this in maidens.  <P>We can nuke decently, yes our soloing is limited but we can.  I can solo spiders in velks using about 50 mana.  With c3 on that comes back decently anyways.  I would love for focus to stack with our self buff but that would give clerics quite a bit more hp, maybe the ancient spell can do this.  <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www3.taywood.net/sot/membersprofile.asp?charname=Shieze&" TARGET=_blank>Shieze Athenia</A><BR>60th High Priest of the Rathe<BR>Member of <A HREF="http://www.spiritoftunare.com" TARGET=_blank> Spirit of Tunare</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I stopped reading about 3/4 of the way down. Everyone seems to agree that we need some upgrades. <P>Personaly the 2 main things I would like to see is a better MoR maybe 25 to 30 points of damage and a druid like pet. The pet doesn't need alot of hp's it just needs to be there for the next fight. <P>I can pull a mob with MoR and use CE on myself between nukes while it beats its self to death on my DS. then I med for 20 minutes and pull again. Not Fun. not throw in a pet that will live while the mob hits you with CE on and a good ds. you have just cut out alot of down time and maybe we could get some ok exp solo. Like the other classes can now.<P>The combination of those 2 would allow us to solo a little better but not as well as the other classes. I think the main concearn is not being able to get a group for exp when we are not at raids. We have an ok mana regen so we can med back up ok. <P>------------------<BR><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36837">Binadint <BR> 59 Templar</a> <BR> <a target="new" href="http://www.solusekro.org/wwwthreads/wwwthreads.pl">Solusek Ro</a><p>[This message has been edited by Binadint (edited 03-05-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
