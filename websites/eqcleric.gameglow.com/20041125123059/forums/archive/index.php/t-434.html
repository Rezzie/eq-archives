<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Illyna</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few suggestions:<br />
<br />
Get DA in there. It will perhaps allow you to make a run for the zone if you get jumped.<br />
<br />
Gate. You are level 17 so you can bind yourself anywhere, usually somehwhere near where you are currently fighting. If you get in trouble and can't make it to the zone in 18 seconds then gate out, rooting the mob if necessary. You can leave this out if you like and then mem it after a DA and then root/gate.<br />
<br />
Buffs. You dont really need to have them memmed all the time. Just swap them in long enough to cast them then get them out again. <br />
<br />
Lots of spells could go here that can help you fight: Cancel magic for the Madmen damage shields, Invigor if you find your stamina getting low, Stun for healers, Yaulp cause AC is always good, and your second best dds (furor and ward undead) for those times when it is really close and you don't have enough mana to cast the primary dd.<br />
<br />
Try to get used to unmemming spells that you don't need cause it won't be long before you'll be wishing you had more than 8 slots. Play around with every spell to see how you like it.<br />

It is useful for healing Casters, and as an emergency heal when you do not have enought mana to throw Healing.<br />
