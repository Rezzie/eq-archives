<br />
As I have never experienced a rez before I had a few simple (and naive) questions....<br />
<br />
Can a cleric rez himself? (I know this would only be useful with the exp rez spells but...)<br />
<br />
Do ya just target the corpse to perform a rez?<br />
<br />
When you rez a person, and they accept the rez, are they just teleported to their corpse? Do they have to re-equip themselves?<br />
<br />
I know these may sound like dumb questions but I appreciate the info!<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said - the procedures for ressing somebody (yourself included)<br />
<br />
Target the corpse to be ressed, and cast spell - the person (including yourself) will receing a box with something to the affect of &quot;somebody wisses to ressurect you - click yes or no&quot; and you get 2 buttons - left side is yes (marked) and right side is no (marked).<br />
<br />
Once you click the yes button you are teleported to where the body is and you are then marked with the ressurection effect.  You lose half your hp, and all of your mana and you lose a significant amount of your stats temporarily.  The affect of the res takes about 2 mins to disappear.  You will have to loot your body to get your stuff back.<br />

<br />
1- A cleric CAN rez himself. (cool huh!)<br />
2- You do have to target the corpse to rez.<br />
3- The person has to accept the rez, there is a bug with that, which I will not go in detail here, but make sure the person WANTS a rez, before you cast.<br />
4- They do have to re-equip, and not only that, they will suffer a &quot;rez sickness&quot;, which brings your str to 0, and some other stats are lessened. Also, they will only have half health, and no mana.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

After the rez question box pops up on your screen ONLY hit 'yes' or you wont get any experience back.  If you hit no or change to your inventory screen or anything you lose that yes/no box and no later rez will restore lost experience.  <br />

<br />
That's my line!<br />
<br />
Never just rez a person without asking them first though, and explaining which level of rez it is you are giving them.  If you just give them a plain old revive, they no longer have any chance of getting xp back.<br />

If something is beating on you and you go below half life, don't worry about dieing again due to the rez effects.  No matter what your HP is when the rez box hits you, after you are resurected you will be at 50% of your HP bar.<br />
If something is beating on you go REZ ME NOW!!!! clicking the yes button gets you a free gate to your body and if you were low on HP you even end up with more then you had.<br />
Just thought I'd mention that.<br />

I always thought that when someone asks you, &quot;Do you want that to go?&quot; as you are pulling through a drive through is a pretty stupid question.<br />
<br />
Something else that hasn't been mentioned here is not to switch targets while you are casting.  That seems to bug the whole Res process too (they get ported to their body, but don't get the xp).  And as the others have said, always ask before you Res.  They may have someone else coming for them, might be shopping or in thier spellbook/inventory, all of which can bug the Res process.<br />

I always preceed every rez with the question to the intended, &quot;Are you ready?&quot;, so I don't catch them digging through inventory, casting a spell, trading, any of the ways the a rez MIGHT get screwed up.<br />
