Player: &quot;Oh, about 2 days.  It was fairly painless.&quot;<br />
Hmmm.  I constantly see Shamans and Warrior running around in full suits of quest armor.  As for us clerics, yeah right.  I have done numerous feedback and emails to Verant about the rarity of the spawns for the cleric armor.  I think everyone will agree with me that it's absurd.  And for some reason, up to this point, Verant refuses to change it.  So until they do, I'm going to throw out the idea of a protest.  Now remeber, this is just and idea.  <br />
<br />
What would the world of EQ be without Clerics?<br />
<br />
Obviously my protest idea is to stop playing you Clerics.  Make Verant make the changes.  I know this is far-fetched but we gotta do something about it. =)</div></div><hr />
