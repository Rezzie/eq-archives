<br />
Fear not enchanters. The summon mana series of spells has been expanded for use in enchanted trade skill items and you may find that enchanted precious metals have uses outside of jewellery craft. It is true that some items with special properties may need a cleric or shaman in addition to an enchanter, and in the case of some cultural items from societies without casters may exclude the enchanter entirely.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif However, the magic items produced with the assistance of a Cleric or Shaman are very noticeably different than those produced with solely enchanters.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Enchanters will remain true to their namesake as masters of enchantments. <br />
