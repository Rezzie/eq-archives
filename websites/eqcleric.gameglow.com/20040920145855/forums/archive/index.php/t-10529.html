You can be scrapping with Carrion ghouls and dry bones and monks to your heart's content.  With a good puller you can do wonders in this zone.<br />

<br />
Last night, made level 25, got a BS Tunic, so I was kind of getting my fill of Unrest. Headed over to Mistmoore, my first time ever in the zone. Buffed up with every Endure spell, Bravery, Spirit Armor and Symbol of Ryltan, Invis to UNdead. Poked right around the zone entrance for 2 min, saw some tower, looked around underneath when all of a sudden:<br />
<br />
A Shadowy Scivener begins to cast a spell.<br />
A Shadowy Mage begins to cast a spell.<br />
Your skin burns as the poison seeps in.<br />
You have been slain by a Shadowy Scivener!<br />
You have lost a level! You are now level 24.<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
Doh! One spell and I was done with 669 HP!<br />
<br />
Once told by some very kind people to avoid the tower, I found that I could solo the Initiate familiars and Pledge familiars and grinning gargoyles quite well!<br />
<br />
It *SEEMS* that the exp i gain for a high blue in MM seems more than the exp I gain for teh same blues in UNrest. Dunno.<br />

Teh trains in Unrest can be a little tough for a level 25.  The trains in Mistmoore can kill a fully healthy 25 without breaking stride.<br />
<br />
Clerics in Unrest rule the world.  Cazic was kill steal central on all servers for so long.  I haven't been back since the rubicite removal though.<br />
<br />
But an intelligent person can go from 20 to 33 in Unrest.  Just observe how trains work and use them to your advantage.   NOt like in many other tougher zones where trains generally contain greens, blues, yellows and a deep mix of reds.  At least in Unrest the worst thing in the zone, the ghost is only 35.<br />

It will keep you on your toes thats for sure. Oh and dont feel bad if your lvl 25 and dont have the invis vs undead spell,..hehe you will need it more than anything else. In this realm your a wizzard with healing powers..I say blast em and whats left goes to heals. I died there 2 time in the first 4 hours of playing there from trains mostly; when other rooms of the house started falling apart.. So it's not easy. But if ya stick with it you can get some realy good items with wis pluses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far I have made 2 levels in 10 hours and about 800pp, if you can get a proper Unrest group together: <br />
<br />
2 Tanks (real ones not rogues),<br />
3 Clerics or 2 Clerics and a Necro<br />
1 Shaman or Druid<br />
<br />
The zone is just about yours providing you don't do something stupid like pull the basement.<br />
<br />
Go there, go there NOW  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
I frequently visit Unrest, usually when I tire of a support role (such as High Keep -- bandaids, anyone?) and need to blow things to bits.<br />
<br />
This morning there were eight people in the zone, made for quite an adventure pulling from the house. Most of the first floor would trail along behind my target, and the second floor pulls almost always ended in an evac.<br />
<br />
I find this zone works best with about twenty people in it, 3 solid groups and a few soloists. A good level separation among the groups keeps the spawn cycle ticking smoothly. Too few, and you end up with several skeletal monks and a werebat gnawing on you... (Praise Bristlebane for granting me gate!)<br />

This is EXCELLENT for xp and loot. God I love this zone. Now if I can just get a BS tunic...  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />
