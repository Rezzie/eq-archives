<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabrianna</div><div class="date">11-28-2001, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had the Velious expansion almost since it came out but because my highest chars are a 31 cleric and 30 druid i've only been there one time in my entire life which was to ride the boat over just to see it.  Someone said it was very dangerous in the area where the raft lands so I stayed on it and went straight back.<br />
<br />
Now that my characters are FINALLY 30+, I want to go darn it!  But I know nothing about Velious.  I want to print some maps but I don't see all the zones mapped.  Could someone please give me the down and dirty on<br />
the dangers of getting off the boat and where I should go first.  I've read about the tower but it seems like it would be dangeorus at low 30s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biggest problem you will find at level 30 in Velious is a lack of pickup groups. Just about anyplace you might go at that level will be BYOG.  <br />
<br />
I have been duoing very regularly with a necro at the Tizmak caves in Great Divide.  It's only a short run from there to Thurgadin.  Since you have no real experience with Velious, I'd recommend getting someone to show you the way to Thurgadin first.  Now that you don't need teeth to port into Velious ports getting there should only take a few minutes if you get a port.<br />
