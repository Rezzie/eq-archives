<br />
Few things about Triality:<br />
We formed about 18 months ago, started in HoT, progressed through expansions, doing ST, VT, then PoP.  We've been in time for about 6 months, beating quarm in first 6 weeks.  Currently working on Uqua, up to Barxt.  Not that it matters due to instanced content, but 2 other guilds on server are in KT.  We raid on CST, anywhere from 5-12, but usually from 6-11.<br />
<br />
What we expect:<br />
We are a hardcore raiding guild, raiding nightly unless lockout timers hold us back.  We expect our members to be on at least 70% of raids, and as clerics are the most important class to any guild, I expect 80% from them.  I expect my clerics to do their job and always strive to be better and this drive for excellence has helped greatly in our success.  We currently have 9 clerics on the roster, with a couple of those being semi-retired, so you won't just be Healer_bish_032.  <br />
<br />
150aa is required and time/KT flags are a huge plus.  Some decent gear is required as well, so if you're still wearing Donal's, don't even think about it.<br />

If you wish to learn more, you can check us out at www.trialityguild.com, but I'd also ask you send a tell to vazaelle.orruar so we can chat before you apply.  If you LD a lot, afk a lot, or just plain don't pay much attention to your job on raids, don't waste my time, this is not the guild for you.  If you are unhappy with the cleric class or unhappy with EQ in general, don't bother applying, a new guild isn't going to magically change these things.  If you like playing cleric, you wish to make the most out of your character and want to be part of one of the best cleric teams out there, toss me a tell and we can chat.</div></div><hr />
