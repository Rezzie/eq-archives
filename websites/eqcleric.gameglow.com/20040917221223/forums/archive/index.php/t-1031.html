Fear not enchanters. The summon mana series of spells has been expanded for use in enchanted trade skill items and you may find that enchanted precious metals have uses outside of jewelry craft. It is true that some items with special properties may need a cleric or shaman in addition to an enchanter, and in the case of some cultural items from societies without casters may exclude the enchanter entirely. However, the magic items produced with the assistance of a Cleric or Shaman are very noticeably different than those produced with solely enchanters. Enchanters will remain true to their namesake as masters of enchantments.</div></div><hr />

There is one other class that dabbles in a chemistry of sorts that can mix dyes besides Shaman.<br />

I really hope they include us &amp; make a thorough job of the implementation.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

I saw the second post and assumed that this meant that rogues could use the poison skill to make dies.<br />

I spoke with a rogue friend of mine, and this ability had been floating around as rumor across many rogue areas for awhlie now.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that we will get a &quot;bless&quot; line of spells, similar to the enchanter's &quot;enchant&quot; line, which will allow us to magically enhance metals.  That way, we would be able to bless either bars of metals for jewelcrafting, or else bless ores (or some step in the armor/weapon making process) in order to magically enhance weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
Just imagine a blacksmith/rogue/cleric/enchanter team working together to make things ... I can only imagine the types of items that would come from that!<br />

<br />
Master brewer, and Smith... hmmm... maybe they could combine the two trades to make an armour that has a Summon Ale effect. Of course if they did that there wouldn't be a sober Dwarf Cleric to be found in all Norrath.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
 Seriously, I've seen enchanted FS weapons being auctioned already, and thought it to be bogus. Has this already been implemented?<br />

The Enchanted FS currently on the market is not from the new trade skills, b/c they haven't gone to the Live servers yet. Rather, the Enchanted FS is from the short-lived &quot;GM Event&quot; in Najena.<br />

<br />
Time for a little idle speculation about the trade skills...  What exactly would a cleric do to a weapon?  There are apparently going to be racial forges... could they possibly be clever enough to implement blessed weapons forgeable by clerics of 'good' deities and cursed weapons for the 'evil' deities' clerics to make?  Of course, it would be fun if it wasn't that cut and dried, but if clerics are needed at some point in the forging process, and they're already implementing race specific forges, it seems a natural step to forge at least some deity specific items.  (Random idea: a Tunare specific shield that added tons of strength for the less physically endowed clerics and paladins...  or a Quellious specific hammer with an effect of Enduring Breath for the Erudites among us.)<br />
<br />
What could a cleric do in the forging process besides blessing and cursing an item?  And what other things could they do with blesses and curses?  I'd love to see some creative new procs added to weapons we have blessed  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/cool.gif Can anyone think of interesting procs, or something completely different?  I'm trying to avoid suggesting mere stat enhancements; frankly, that's all I really expect to see and I'd like to be excited for a while before we see what they do  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Erudite clerics CAN serve Quellious, right?  *blushes*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I just wonder - <br />
<br />
Why is that because Erudites have Quellious, everyone wants us to get enduring breath items?   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Don't get me wrong, they are awesome places like Kedge but, jeez..   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  we're WEENIES!  WE HAVE GIRLY ARMS!   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  We need strength too, dangit.<br />
<br />
I think all the non-infra/ultravision folks should get something granting them a little help.. even infravision would be vastly superior to humans/barbarians/erudites' vision.<br />
<br />
And to answer your question - yes, Erudite clerics are either Quellious or Cazic.<br />

Will be interesting to see if any of it effects agnostic warriors  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nige Willowleaf</div><div class="date">09-02-2000, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about this : diety specific forges and cleric blessings that improve faction with your diety? Like what if you could make a cake that when eaten would allow you to pass through Neriak or Paineel for 10 minutes?. If someone needed to buy an item in a town or bank they could have temporary faction by obtaining and eating the item from a cleric of that temple?<br />
<br />
Or say you could make city specific binding items with one charge. I am from Qeynos. I could make a rod or something that would grant a person one bind in my city.<br />
<br />
These are just two non-stat ideas I had.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greyfist</div><div class="date">09-04-2000, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the secret sought:  There is an Imbue &lt;gemstone&gt; line of spells that allows clerics to bless gems, which are then used in armor, weapons, or any other tradeskill item that Verant decides to use them in.  I don't know what level the spells are, sadly, with my luck they'll all be 50+ or somesuch.  Check out the tradeskill discussion forums on stratics.com, the smithing forum is hard at work trying to scrounge up recipes for new armor and weapons, and it is they who discovered the new spells.</div></div><hr />
