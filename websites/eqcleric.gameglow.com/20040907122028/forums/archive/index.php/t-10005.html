We were all in highschool once. We, well most of us, egged houses on devils night. I just happened to use waterballoon launchers to do it but it's the same difference. But there's gotta be mroe of you out there aside from myself that would just love to do something rediculous to them. It's childish, it's immature, but dammit it'd be fun. So if any of you have any ideas lay em on me. maybe one day i'll be taking a drive near VI headquarters and do something http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
(nothing harmful and nothing threatening, just immature and funny please)<br />
<br />
something like, dress up in a big suit of armour and sit out on the front lawn. If anyone asks i'll say &quot;I'm camping Brad, do you know when he spawned last?&quot;<br />
<br />
Or make a wheelchair stencil and go really late at night when no one is around, and spraypaint it in every single parking space in the lot. Mwahahahahaha <br />
<br />
Draw some chalk outlines all over the place with characters names who've quit the game and a little reason why underneath.<br />
<br />
Hire a bunch of midgets, put them in dark green armour and paint their skin pale green. Then have them run around the building trying to talk in Thurgish. Tell them to glower dubiously at anyone who looks like they're in charge. Or anyone thats really tall.</div></div><hr />

Get 4 sheets of BLACK construction paper, tape them together end to end. Go to the fax machine, dial up your enemies number, insert long black page in the fax and tape it as it comes out to form a continuous loop. Go home and laugh for 24 hours....Their fax will print till it uses all their toner. Hehe toner isn't cheap.<br />

Sorry, but I have never found destructive jokes (ie practical jokes) funny.  And in this case you could get hit with consipring to impeed business practices or some such.<br />
<br />
Now, if they have a caffeteria, getting them to order a big batch of fish rolls and some kind of pink, bubble, soda...</div></div><hr />

Wait until mid winter when strawberries are out of season in much of the country. Call the local produce company and pretend to work and the establishment you hate at the moment. Ask them to add a couple hundred cases of strawberries to &quot;your&quot; order.. bill should be a couple grand...priceless..<br />
 Harmless somewhat because the manager will spend a couple hours on the phone tightening up their order procedures and begging the vendor to take the berries back... not that I ever did this to an ex employer or anything..<br />

<br />
1) Why take something that is in a game and transfer actions into RL? The two are entirely separate issues.<br />
<br />
2) While we may disagree with many of the decisions made by VI it is thier game and we can leave any time we would like.<br />
<br />
3) I can see this thread degenarating into much more harmful actions that the harmless ones suggested by the original poster.<br />

<br />
In any case, I will share with you the one way to REALLY get at Verant, perfectly legally and without setting yourself up for a lawsuit...<br />
<br />
Cancel your account and stop giving them money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">06-07-2002, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG, clones bred without senses of humour are posting on our mesage board?!?!?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Battlecups</div><div class="date">06-07-2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easy there Aean ... not everyone is as bothered by this as you are ... no need to start tossing comments like that around, regardless of your intent. Let's try to keep our decorum constant, even on the rant boards. This place is to let off steam, not take shots at other posters.<br />
<br />
As for the recent patching and changes, I am way past getting upset at Verant by now. It is a part of the game at this point. /shrug<br />
<br />
Let them keep tinkering. I play EQ for my friends, guildmates, and the sheer thrill of making it through that epic fight with the insane number of adds alive. If Verant ever changes the game to the point where I find it unplayable, then I will walk away as I have before and look to the next game. Heck, I have already done that twice with AO and DAoC respectively.<br />
<br />
Besides, I am a dwarf. They can knock me down, but they cannot keep me down. Oh, and if they do knock me down it best be to get themselves a better headstart... /grin<br />

That way they'll see what it's like to play with all sorts of f***ed up quests, mobs, and zones. Then maybe they'll finally get a clue. What happened to &quot;The Customer is always right&quot; anway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 (whaa  thats not funny...whaaaaa why let a game involve your r/l.....whaaaa  whaaa whaaa)   Get a friggin clue people it was meant to be funny   not to be taken seriously.  Now go have a coke and a smile and cry yourselves to sleep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">06-11-2002, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hahaha thanks for the sentiment RN Freak http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif but it's true, these people are clones without sense of humour. Maybe they need to worship the devil a little more and listen to some rock and roll on occasion. but until that time you, me and the rare few are the only bastion of humour!!! <br />
and for those curious, being able to recite every monty python movie line for line does not mean you have a sense of humour:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, I understand now.  It failed, and reading the thread turned out to be just a waste of time that could have been better spent searching for navel lint.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I guess I'm just a clone... I'm not falling into lock-step with you, I must not be l33t.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lith Ahntalon</div><div class="date">06-12-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw a couple of posts under the original which suggested pranks that cost people money. I don't think costing folks money for a prank is funny and I felt that this thread had the potential to devolve into that. If that is uncool, fine, no worries, I am uncool and have no sense of humor.</div></div><hr />
