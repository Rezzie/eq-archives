Cazic is an option, but I HATE the distance, and I HATE the bouncers.  Paw is over my head at 26 still, and Unrest, although i love it, is too train ridden.  And I won't even consider mistmoore for the same reason.  suggestions?  as soon as I hit 29, I definately plan to live in cazic (Revive does wonders for tank travel times!)<br />

Most nights there is at least one or more groups in the low to mid 20's there, you should have no problem finding a group and pulling from the maze.  Lots of good experience, great loot even from the maze -- lots of fs...<br />

I mean every spawn, literally is camped.  If you don't get a group early or if your group doesn't have a room, tough luck.  Its sad really to see such a great hunting spot go downhill.  Off course 100people in a zone made for maybe 50 or so is never good.<br />
