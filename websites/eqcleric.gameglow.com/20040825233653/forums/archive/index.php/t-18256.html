<br />
Recent farming of practically all Elemental content including victories against Fennin Ro and also winning access to Plane of Earth B leaves only <br />
three more encounters barring our progress to the Plane of Time. <br />
<br />
The guild would wish to formally serve notice to:- <br />
<br />
Xegony, Coirnav &amp; the Rathe Council... you are next! <br />
<br />
We wish to add some more clerics to our existing roster so that we may concentrate the guild's current efforts. We not requiere any flags at all, gear and aas aren't important too. Just need a good attendance.<br />
<br />
If this sounds like you and this is the sort of content that arouses your interest the entry requirements and how to apply can be found by following the links posted below. <br />

<br />
As has been said before, Venril Sathir is a european server from UbiSoft, so be sure you want to move there, because you can't move back char again to SOE servers. Now you are allowed to get all expansions if you are UbiSoft customer, so that isn't a problem (can get GoD too now)<br />
