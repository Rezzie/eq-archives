People are getting planes quality gear off of common mobs and it's not No Drop?<br />
<br />
Doesn't the easy availability all of this good stuff throw off the game balance completely? It certainly will bugger the economy.<br />

I wish I could head over there and do something worth while.  Too bad that I am probably in danger of doing so, being only level 26.<br />

I watched someone bring their character over to see Kunark, and a /who showed that there were only 3 people under 25 in the entire zone.. and the /ooc was saying that if you weren't at least 35, you wouldn't survive to get to another &quot;low persons&quot; zone. I thought Kunark was supposed to be for everyone... not ALL of us are playing their fourth character because the first 3 are all 50 or whatever.. some of us are still muddling thru as best we can.</div></div><hr />

The thing that sickened me was not the incredible loot dropping in some of the tougher zones, because after all some of these zones are supposed to be tougher than the planes (Gordon called Veeshan's Peak the hardest zone in the game today). <br />
<br />
No, the thing that sickened me was to see newbie Iksar running around already with Mistmoore shields and other items from the outlands. Come on - at least get your character into double digit levels before twinking the hell out of them. Give the new race and new zones a chance to prove their worth.<br />

Good Idea. Sometimes the best ideas are the simplest ones... maybe it is just my dwarven stubborn streak peeking through ;-)<br />
