<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klairen</div><div class="date">12-21-1999, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here I am with near 200 wisdom, an almost full set of quest armor (missing gauntlets and bracers), and halfway through level 39. But guess what, I am real tired of playing cleric.<br />
<br />
The only places that I get asked to join groups are in Sol B and Lower Guk. God how I hate sitting in one room, healing and buffing everyone, and repeatedly killing the same 5 creatures over and over and over again. I get exp., I get loot, and I get bored.<br />
<br />
How do you people do it? How can I get to 50 and enjoy the trip there? I've been to kedge twice and had a blast, but one of those trips was as a level 42 Druid (my RL friends character), I've also teamed with a few friends and killed Seafuries in OOT and had a pretty good time. It's just that those are uncommon events, and during the time between them, if I want xp, I have to go sit in a room in some dungeon for hours. The planes would be interesting, but they are two hell levels away. I plan on getting Klair to 40 and only bringing her out when friends need an xp res.<br />
<br />
<br />
This next part is off subject:<br />
<br />
I've started a new class, one that can solo outdoors much easier than a cleric. That way, I can go kill the Seafuries by myself if necessary or just do something different every day and not have to worry about getting a group to kill a giant, I'll just do it alone (I have just as much fun soloing as I do grouping, it's just the idea of camping one spot for hours that makes me sick).<br />
<br />
I have to admit that the necro is one of the most fun classes to play (and if I want to be an high level enchanter or druid, I'll just log in as the RL friend). They have so many interesting spells compared to the cleric.<br />
<br />
Want to know the best parts? I never heal or buff anyone, except the pet. I rarely even buff myself. Less down time than the cleric since I have a mana regen spell. Unless I have a pet summoned, I am always invis. And my favorite: When it looks like the group is going to die, I can shadow step, gate, feign death, or do almost anything to keep myself alive. No more healing that near dead, overpulling tank until I am oom and defenseless. (Don't get upset with those last couple of statements, it's proper necro attitude =P )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalaelyan</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Granted I have only gotten my enchanter up to level 30, but I started to feel exactly the same way you were feeling.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to do anything with my enchanter (except sit around the aviak tree for another five levels), I had to group up with more than just my ranger partner and deal with many different people every day, some who had absolutely no clue how to make the most of their enchanter.  (Or even any other class, for that matter...some people just *are* clueless)<br />
<br />
There are fun aspects of that kind of grouping.  Meet lots of different people and make new friends.  I really enjoyed those aspects of pick-up grouping.<br />
<br />
But I just don't want to do it all the time!<br />
<br />
And oftentimes, my partner and I would go into Cazic (our newest hunting ground) and at 4am EST, there were a total of eight people in the dungeon, including us, and no one wanted to group or they were already in a group, or something like that.<br />
<br />
So what do we do now?  Even if we could find something to solo,that wouldn't rip us to pieces in no time flat (just having ranger healing *sucks*) experience goes soooooo slow for rangers and enchanters, that we could kill something for five hours straight, maybe gain a half bubble or so if we are lucky, and then lose it all the very next moment in a death by uber-mob sneaking up while starting at the stupid book.  Extremely frustrating.  It's a wonder we have even made it to 30, much less 50.<br />
<br />
I finally broke down and just made a newbie to play during times when we can't find a good group or we just can't group, and I've been having a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
When we want to deal with the hassles of pick-up grouping, and the deaths and almost-deaths and never-ending overexcitement that comes with it, we can log in our other characters and fight in Cazic.<br />
<br />
When we want to do things on our own, we play our newbies (and we've been playing these newbies a *lot* recently!)  I started a cleric and she had started a newbie necro a while ago but never really played, so pulled the necro back out again.<br />
<br />
It seems that clerics can solo a lot better than enchanters (and was what had inspired my question about solo clerics on the general board) and necros are supposed to be solo machines.<br />
<br />
Unless Verant really nerfs both our classes, we should be able to group or solo with at least one of our characters anytime we please.  Group goes bad?  No problem, we are not stuck sitting around with nothing to do after hitting that disband button.  We can go fight something on our own.<br />
<br />
I will get my enchanter to level 50 eventually, but sometimes we just need to stop and do something different, when the other things we are doing become too frustrating.<br />
<br />
It seems like you have already made a good start.  You still like your cleric, but you aren't being a &quot;traitor&quot; playing something else along with the cleric.  And you will eventually get to level 50 if that's what you want.  Might not be fast, but you'll get there.<br />
<br />
Just depends on what you want to get out of the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't speak about more the 25, but I can say one way to make the game more interesting.  Personally, I like the guild chat.  You might consider getting in a guild and being able to follow conversations.  A guild isn't something you do to always have a party, or to be twinked, or anything else like that.  My guild varies widely in level and we rarely group except with people of similar level.  As a Cleric it might be a problem since people may bug you for exp resurrections.  Groups don't tend to talk much.  Maybe a lot of people are talking to their guild. : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about guildchat, it's really fun hearing the (sofar) only troll in the guild talk about how dwarf meat tastes, and other people respond by being afraid that they will get eaten.<br />
<br />
Of course, I said that I would respond to an attempt in the same way as K (in MiB) did: Blast myself out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heklar</div><div class="date">12-22-1999, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I like playing a Cleric alot.<br />
<br />
A) I hate solo'ing, if you like it power to you, I play Everquest to interact with people and have fun.<br />
<br />
B) I played an SK to lvl 24 as my first char and I HATED not being able to do dungeon crawls without a cleric, well, now I always have a cleric in my group.<br />
<br />
C) Give me Word of Health or give me death. Gawd I love that spell.<br />
<br />
D) See B, clerics rocks<br />
<br />
E) It's kind of a pain to solo cause I have to use retribution with a slow refresh, but it's not to bad mixed it with sound of force and immobolize, I don't like soloing anyway, even 2 people is better then boredom<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erolotis</div><div class="date">12-23-1999, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My time as a cleric has never really been boring.<br />
<br />
I was solo alot 1-23rd and was successful. Since then, I have made so many in-game friends I always have someone to hang with and as long as I play I find others will as well. For instance, late night gaming in a group in Perma or SolusekA; everyone hung out having fun, despite being tired and whatnot. When I finally HAD to sleep averyone else logged because no buffs, no healing= DEATH.<br />
<br />
I have a warrior and if I can't find a cleric or some type of healer that is when fun is over. I also played a necro but found it kinda boring due to the fact it is so solitary a class. You have a tank and ok dd and dots, but all the tank does is cackle and without clarity I see no difference in necro downtimes from cleric ones. I play Eq to interact with others if I wanted to play a solitary RP game there are more than enough on the market where I do not have to pay $10 a month, i.e. Baldurs Gate ect.<br />
<br />
If on the off chance I have no one to group with then I will just get a SOW and travel the zones soloing and buffing-healing and ressing peeps for free. There is always something to do as a cleric, the class is built to compliment the game more than any other.<br />
<br />
Yours,<br />
