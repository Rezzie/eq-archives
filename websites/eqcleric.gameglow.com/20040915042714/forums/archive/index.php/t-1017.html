<br />
If the command to stand up is /sit off,<br />
is the command to sit back down /sit on?<br />
<br />
Im at work right now so I dont have the luxury of testing this before I write this.<br />
<br />
The reason I'm asking is because I see alot of ppl using &quot;Quick Heal&quot; macros to stand up and cast a heal, or any other spell for that matter, yet I dont see any of these macros making you sit back down afterwards to keep medding. Wouldnt it be useful to auto sit down after casting that quick heal so you can continue to med? ie.:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/g whatever here...<br />
/cast 1 (or whatever heal slot it is)<br />
/sit on (to sit back down and continue<br />
         medding)<br />
<br />
Was just wondering why I didnt see any of the macros having us sit back down  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verbannen</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The command to sit is simply /sit<br />
<br />
One limitation of the macros is that there is no delay or waiting for completion.  They act as if you did all the commands yourself in rapid succession.<br />
<br />
Thus:<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 3<br />
<br />
works properly, whereas<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 3<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
would do the same thing, because the /sit command would hit during the casting of the spell, which, of course, is ignored because you are already casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/book 1<br />
<br />
Command to sit and med.<br />
<br />
I use the following in my Guidl group last night:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/target Battlehiem<br />
/cast 3<br />
/g Battlehiem GHeal INC with your name on it!<br />
<br />
LOL I made one key for each &quot;tank&quot; and then had 3 buttons left.<br />
<br />
One was for:<br />
<br />
/cast 5<br />
<br />
(Healing for casters lower level spell, I like to keep them topped off if I can)<br />
<br />
Then I used:<br />
<br />
/book 1<br />
/g Medding <br />
<br />
and lastly:<br />
<br />
/g On me cannot cast/heal :&gt;O<br />
/em thinks Battlehiem should taught the Baddie off the healer...<br />
<br />
Hehe the Last /em is just playing around, like when I told my group in Unrest:<br />
<br />
&quot;OK guys, you leave this room...no heals...I die...no heals...No roots or snares...no heals...Hodona you DD before its rooted or past half health no heals for you either mlady =P.&quot;<br />
<br />
LOL A lighthearted Cleric makes for a far less stressful time. The new commands help alot.<br />
<br />
/em thinks he can actually feel his fingers after playing for 5 hours last night...a true blessing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note.  I attempted the following macro:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast somenumber<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
My personal experience with it was the /sit command wasn't ignored, rather it sat me down in the middle of casting which made my spell not go off.  I don't know if this was change in the last patch but I found that I couldn't add the /sit command in the macros or it messed up the casting of the spell.  Perhaps I'll try again.<br />

Lessee, I have the most fun, can't wait til they fix the @ thing, tho.. gets funny when I keep casting complete heal on someone who logged an hour ago.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
My retribution button is fun tho..<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
:calls forth the wrath of the gods.<br />
/cast 4(retribution)<br />
<br />
Hehehe, when the @ is fixed, it will be calling forth the wrath of the gods on @.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made hotkey macros to heal the tank and enchanter, but then when it came to healing other party members I used the old fashioned way... however it was confusing to go back and forth.  I think I'll hotkey everyone in the future.  I hate using my mouse for casting spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llew Lifebringer</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Salina - I'm glad you mentioned the @ bug.  Have other folks noticed the same that I did - notably that the person it mentions isn't actually always the person you've targetted?<br />
<br />
I really disliked when I shot off a heal - and it told a different person that I was healing them.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather have no info than bad info, so I got rid of the macro.  And I *really* wish you could then change the icon on the macro - &quot;Heal&quot; on a button isn't nearly as useful as the blue hand.  (Or that useful yellow shield that I tend to mash in a hurry.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">09-01-2000, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, yes Llew, it's not just you.<br />
<br />
Apparently Verant is aware of it, and will be fixing it with the next patch.<br />
<br />
But it will be SO very nice when they do.. especially for things like complete heal, where it's important to let others know it's coming.. and for divine aura, so people know not to try to heal you.<br />
<br />
It's also a lot of fun with retribution tho..   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif   &quot;Salina calls forth the wrath of the gods...&quot;<br />
