I would really like to know if i could get into all the evil cities around norath.  any info will be appreciated.   thanks</div></div><hr />

The last time I checked, we were ok with the inkies, but I never attempted to wander within Neriak.<br />
<br />
I encountered no trouble in Freeport, aside from the Ogre Warrior who sometimes visits the pub by the docks.<br />
<br />
I believe some dorf factions are threatening to us by default, but all of Greater Faydark tolerated me, and after some time in Crushbone, those dorfs in BB didn't mind me anymore.  I bet Neriak hates me now :P<br />
<br />
I haven't tried Ak'Anon, nor Felwithe.<br />
<br />

<br />
My Erudite Necro is KOS there, but my friend has an Erudite Dark Cleric who is planning on making a run past that place soon.<br />
<br />
Any info would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I didn't bother/dare to drop the camoflage after passing them.  I can't answer for the humans in the zone, but I'm fairly sure the orcs would have left me alone.  It seemed all orcs were indifferent to me by default.<br />
