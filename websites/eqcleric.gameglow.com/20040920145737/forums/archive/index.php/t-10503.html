I have been grouping in Unrest for 3 levels now.  I find it really difficult to find a group that is dedicated to protecting their healer before their casters.  I have lost te 20th circle 3 times now =(.  Does anyone have any tips on how to choose a group to join or on how to form a good group.  I would like to be able to get my next spell circle so that I may better serve my group.<br />

I have died so many times because of bad groups in this zone!  The only problem, to find the good groups you have to filter through the bad.  My advice is as soon as you know you are in a bad group, disband.  Don't waste your time.  Here soon you can actually solo a bit there.  The best time is during off hours when there are less than 10 people in zone.  There are a few places that spawn only one mob that you can pull outside, or if you get a bad pull, pull to zone, and then immediately zone back in.  You should be able to pick off one of the mobs running back to their spawn spot.  Hope this helps!!<br />

You need to get a good group or you are dead (some of the times that wont help either). The worst thing with the zone is the trains, not the usual ones, but the ones from second floor that is not announced and that run out the backdoor etc. If you are luck try to sneak in with a lvl 21 - 25 grouup, decent exp if you camp the second floor, but they usually dont want low lvl in them.<br />
<br />
I can only give you one advice on what I did when I died the tenth time in as many hours and my exp was going backwords. Go solo in SolRo and Oasis. Solo Mummies, Ghouls, Skellies if you are really careful. <br />
If you like to travel, go to South Karana (I ran there from SolB) and join a Aviac group. If you are luck and find the hermit alone, shout for one more and camp it for the rest of your time on EQ for the day. <br />
<br />
I camped it with a nuker and tried it with druid (you will love SoW when the gnomes attack you). The trick is easy, walk up to the house, say something like &quot;I will kill you&quot;. He will attack you through the wall and you get him targeted. Cast fear, he runs away. But since it is a wall around the house he wont get out. You nuke him once, and cast fear again (dont root since he then will go hand to hand and he hits hard!) while the nuker takes him out. Med up and start over.<br />

<br />
I camped him for a day, and then watched someone else camp him for a day.  He spawns quickly-  something like every 3 minutes.  The camper stands near the chimney and says &quot;kill you&quot;.<br />
<br />
He does try to hit through the walls.  But each time, he would pop out somehow.  Several times I saw him come down the roof, sort of like a reverse Santa Claus.<br />
<br />
Debuff his thorn shield; no need to have extra damage from him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Craggmoor</div><div class="date">03-22-2000, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too had a hard time in Unrest when I was 19.  I spent about a weeks playtime (which is only about 10 hours total) in Unrest.  I would get into a group, get some xp, then die.  Come back, get back my xp and die.  Come back, get my stuff, get caught in a basement train - die again.  You get the picture.<br />
<br />
I decided to come back to Unrest when I am 24 with better equipment and spells.  I hope to survive a little longer  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I agree with hunting in SK.  I have been here since leaving Unrest.  The Aviaks are good to hunt, the hermit is good and you can occassionally get into a group hunting the gnolls outside of Split Paw.  All of these give good to great xp and some pretty good loot.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<br />
And if your group isn't helping to keep you alive, don't be afraid to hit Divine Aura and run for it.</div></div><hr />
