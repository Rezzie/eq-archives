<br />
<br />
I see many many spelling mistakes, and for some reason it tends to drive me a bit mad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would love to have a spell check to check me.  At the risk of being ridiculed, some of us haven't had the advantage of a full education.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stern</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no ridicule intended to anyone<br />
<br />
Just pointed out a nice , free dictionary for people</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didn't take it as ridicule, Stern :) <br />
<br />
Just an instintive reaction on my part.  Many people I've met over the years feel free to comment about my lack of education after knowing me for a whole 10 minutes.  Kinda puts me on the defensive before anythings even said.<br />
<br />
Btw.  added the link to favorites and used it to check this post.  May take me awhile to get in the habit, but I agree that well spelled post seem to carry more weight.  Now I just need something for the grammatical side.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stern</div><div class="date">08-29-2002, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wicked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please bear in mind that not all posters here have english as their native language. And I'll be dammed if I'm to use a spell checker to get, lets say; abbrevation right - why is that word so durn long anyways?<br />
<br />
But using a spellchecker could be a good way to improve the readability of your message.<br />
<br />
And adding a &quot;.&quot; and pressing &quot;return&quot; from time to time helps too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thundar, one thing i have noticed is that people that have english as their first language generally have more spelling errors then those who dont.<br />
:p <br />
<br />
Just my observation ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cland</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have horrid Spelling and I'm proud of it omg!<br />
<br />
Nah, most of the time its just stress of a certin situation (ya ya its a long word) when you have to type really fast and that kinda carries over into forum posting.<br />
<br />
For instance (sp? ;)) in the middle of a CHeal line are you gonna check your spelling to see if you have a typo when your telling people to speed up?<br />
<br />
And the other half is me really not knowing how to spell some words.  And I'm in college in America ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stern</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course nobody (nobody I know of) would care about typo's in-game. I was only referring to typo's I see on message board posts. <br />
<br />
And yes, I realize many people do not speak English as thier first language. You can usually spot those types of posts, and again, that wasn't the type I refer to in this &quot;pseudo&quot; rant thread. <br />
<br />
I guess the type that have been bugging me lately are the ones where you see so many typo's , that you just KNOW the person writing them has no idea they are spelling the words wrong..And would not care anyway..<br />
<br />
btw (and this is just in jest), run a spell checker on this page..</div></div><hr />

I suggest taking screenshots and haunting your friends with the funniest ones forever :D</div></div><hr />
