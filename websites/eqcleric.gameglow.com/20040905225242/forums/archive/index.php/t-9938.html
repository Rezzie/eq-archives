<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daku inochi</div><div class="date">08-21-2001, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my buddy from my place of employment started on Everquest a few weeks ago and he's got a level 9 magician now. I semi-twinked his Mage so that he can have a little fun and avoid some trouble at the same time. A nice robe, jewelry and two good held items make him look like some main's twink. But he's not.. he's a true-blue newb. And he has the scars to prove it...<br />
<br />
I get a tell from him one night, asking if I was near Butcherblock because he lost his body and didn't know where to start looking for it. I asked him what killed him and he said &quot;some big skeleton&quot;. Immediately I think &quot;Chessboard&quot;. I've got nothing especially daunting on my plate - so I get a lift over to Butcherblock from a kindly druid who demands 20 plat in advance for the ride. And we depart.<br />
<br />
/scribbles down a name on my &quot;Overcharge These Folks for Rezzes&quot; list.<br />
<br />
I locate my buddy sitting naked at the BB/GF zoneline, looking very sad that he can't get his corpse back. I tell him don't worry.. I'll find it. I click my jboots and take off for the Chessboard. I also turn on ANON because I don't want the million or so folks in the area pleading with me about how badly the game has mistreated them, etc. I hear more sad stories than God. <br />
<br />
As I'm tooling about, looking for his corpse I spot a 30-something near the chessboard and wonder &quot;hmm... I wonder what he is doing there?&quot;. The chessboard is for folks up to 16 or so. He sure isn't making XPs.. and loot there sucks so.... <br />
<br />
/ponders that for a moment and moves on.<br />
<br />
I finally spot the body after 10 minutes of an expanding spiral search and drag it back to my buddy who is jumping up and down with joy. He loots up and I buff him and his pet up pretty good. Then I ask him &quot;what exactly killed you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some skeleton king or something&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was it about 14 feet tall and brown?&quot; I ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup. That's him&quot; he replies.<br />
<br />
Strange. I found his corpse near the first merchant along the path. There's no WAY he made it that far with a level 14 Skeletal King following him. He should have died near the chessboard. So I prod him on a bit more, looking for the whole story.<br />
<br />
He tells me that he went to the chessboard but it was already camped by a 30ish person, so he left and was heading down to the path to hunt basilisks. He was sitting down medding when &quot;bam-bam&quot; that big bad Skeleton starts punching his lights out. LOADING, PLEASE WAIT. <br />
<br />
Hmm... That skeleton does NOT roam. And there's no way he aggroed it. So... I check back with the 30-something person near the Chessboard and spot him. A level 38 DE Necro. Immediately I'm thinking - he's charming the Skeletons and messing with other players. I figure out the rest of the story on my own. Necro charms the skel... has it follow him to my buddy sitting down.. then gates out of the zone or FDs, breaking the charm and leaving it to aggro the nearby mage. Sure, it's amusing to him, not so much to my buddy. What the necro DOESN'T know is that my buddy has a SERIOUSLY devious friend who does NOT put up with stupid sh*t like that.<br />
<br />
Okay. The necro likes to play? Let's play.<br />
<br />
/gets jiggy with it. <br />
<br />
I figure since that Dark Elf is here on a hunting tour, he's probably ganked more than his fair share of dwarven guards and his faction is worth ****. I make an educated gamble and enact my plan. I bind myself just inside Greater Faydark zoneline and then bolt over to the guards near the 2nd hut. I target one of the guards and /CON him. Apparently, I've done well in my early years and I'm WARMLY to this guy. Great! I throw a Fear spell which sends Guard Norin fleeing for his life. I do a little typing to prepare for the onslaught to come and setup a few hotkeys.<br />
<br />
I sit down and watch the little guard pump his miniature legs quickly, propelling him in far away from me. Then I see the message &quot;your fear spell has been broken&quot; and I watch as he makes a beeline directly for me. I quickly con him and he's THREATENING now. Fantastic!! I now have his complete and undivided attention. I stand up, tap my Jboots once and head for the Chessboard.<br />
<br />
Wheeee!!!!!<br />
<br />
I pause to see if the little Guard is following me every few hundred feet - I don't want to lose him in the hills and traffic. He's angry as all heck at me and stays on my heels, trying to get close enough to hurt me. I hug the left mountain base as I get close to the Greater Fay zoneline and swing left towards the Chessboard, staying high on the wall of the mountain so that no one sees me. There are a few trees there and they hide my movement fairly well. I spot the necro sitting on the side of the board with a Undead Knight as a pet. Wow.<br />
<br />
I check my calendar. Hmm.. it doesn't have a &quot;This Is Your Lucky Day!&quot; note marked on it so I'll take this as a sign from the gods that I must be living a good life.<br />
<br />
I zip down from the necro's blind side and get far enough ahead of the guard so that I have time to sit down next to the necro.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hiya! How are you?&quot; I ask him as I sense the impending guard coming up on my rear.<br />
<br />
Before the necro has time to answer, I hit my Divine Barrier spell and go invulnerable for 18 seconds. I then sit back down as the dwarven guard closes the distance. I hit the hotkey which I had previously prepared...<br />
<br />
/Say BTW.. ya gotta be careful when you mess with people.<br />
<br />
The Guard by this point had reached me but because I am Invulnerable, switches targets and starts *pummelling* the evil necro. The necro is completely in shock and doesn't even do anything for a moment. Bam, Bam, Bam. The guard is all fists and fury. The skeletal pet jumps into the fight and tries to defend its master but is nearly useless against the level 40-something guard. I walk backwards, still invulnerable and watch the guard hitting the necro mercilessly as the necro tries to get a spell off. It's at this point where I start to grin, knowing that payback is *indeed* a bitch.<br />
<br />
Once more, the gods smile upon me as I notice the charm on the pet breaking - - the Knight starts pounding on the necromancer, too!! I see that my Divine Barrier is about to expire so I hit my Divine Aura. This provides me with an additional 18 seconds to enjoy this deadly show. The necro is down to less than half health and he starts shouting for help. I hit my second previously-prepared hotkey...<br />
<br />
/Say There is no one here to help you, Evil One.<br />
<br />
Unable to get a spell off, the necro tries running for the zone, but the two enemies are destroying him a blue bubble at a time. I watch the necro fall lifeless to the ground and give a little &quot;/grins.&quot; emote. The Guard then turns back towards me, it's original target and charges. I click off the effects of Divine Aura and hit my Gate button. The Guard manages to reach me before the spell finishes and hits me three times before I Channel right through his flurry of attacks and create a portal out of Butcherblock. Mission complete.<br />
<br />
I zone into Greater Faydark and send a tell to my buddy still sitting in Butcherblock. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bud.. it's all clear now. You can safely hunt again&quot; I tell him as I sit and &quot;/camp desktop&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
I do a quick /who necro 38 all and see that the bad guy is now naked in Neriak. Heheheh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swatted a *very* evil fly.. enjoy the night!!&quot; I respond before logging off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Moral to the Story: Do NOT f*ck with my friends. &lt;grin&gt; <br />

Ahh.. you might be right.  I think I may have read that the wrong way. Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Resurrector,<br />
<br />
I *did* have a pretty good idea what happened.  Unlike a court, however, I don't have to wait for all the legel proceedings and piles of lawyers to deduce what transpired and act accordingly.  By that time, the player in question would have grown old and died of natural causes.<br />
<br />
Go to Oasis and watch the evil folks dragging Specs up and down the beach, using newbies as speed bumps.  Go to Karnors where people drag stuff into the Hand room in order to force the current group to evac and thus take the camp spot.  There are dozens and dozens of situations where people take advantage of other peoples' weaknesses.  It's sad but it happens.  I've seen this over and over again.. so if you want to color me &quot;disgraceful&quot; for taking matters into my own hands instead of /petitioning and waiting like an imbecile for a Guide to show up and tell you &quot;they have to see it happen first-hand&quot;, then go ahead.<br />
<br />
I've saved TONS of folks from miserable nights and helped more people than I can possibly remember.  And it's moments like this - when I can proactively stop someone from being a miserable SOB to someone else - which makes me proud to say that I stick up for my friends without pause or remorse. <br />
<br />
And the simple fact that he *never* complained about me speaks VOLUMES about the fact that he knew he was doing someone dirty.<br />

<br />
Yes it's disgraceful. You never even made the attempt to talk to him. And I guess it was impossible that someone else in the zone (there usually are more than 2 people in a zone) trained your friend. Or maybe they didn't train but were running to the guards for help and died? <br />

It's usually fairly hard to get a GM to do anything about someone especially when they just camped to the desktop......<br />
<br />
<br />
Next time you try and train someone at least be honest and not spout this bs. Not every necro you see will be truely evil.<br />
<br />
Basically the only one we know for sure that trained anyone was you. You even boasted about it. You even hinted in your message that you have done this before.<br />

You obviously need to go back and read his post. He admitted that he never even talked to this guy and just assumed he had done it. How would you feel if someone just assumed you had done something and trained you? And can you just assume that 1 person in that zone had done this? Out of a zone that averages (at least on Veeshan) apx 20-35 people...<br />

Also, one would think that if he were attempting to harvest the mobs there, he'd have a pet with him.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry if I caused a ruckus in the cleric community.. that wasn't the intent. I just wanted to bring a fun story to light.<br />
<br />
Gim, Zyon, Moehann, Tal, Jub, Crys, Cam... thanks for the show of support!<br />
<br />
Res, Shag and others: <br />
<br />
I COULD hide behind the notion that I was just role-playing my cleric... (i.e. all necros are evil) but I won't.  I have a necro alt and I love playing his bad self.  He rocks. And he's a force to be reckoned with, no matter if you are an NPC or a duelling player.  So I know the potential and secrets of the class. <br />
<br />
I COULD also say that if the necro was farming the place for bone chips, then he's at a VERY bad spot - chips fall like rain in the newbie hunting grounds in Freeport, GF and that undead spot in LF.  And a level 38 necro would NOT be wasting his time in Butcherblock when the top floor of Befallen is SO ripe for the picking.  Maybe my deductive reasoning is off, but what else could he have been doing in BB?  Would YOU hunt for bone chips there if you were level 38?  Heck no.  You'd sooner go to the ruins in EC and paste those spawns and all the wandering skeletons.  There are a LOT more spawns available there.  Plus the fact that every other young person is selling stacks of bonechips every 3 min makes *that* defense weak at best.<br />
<br />
I'd rather believe in the fact that while each person plays the game for enjoyment, sometimes that enjoyment comes at someone else's expense.  Given the situation and the points I explained (i.e. if the necro was farming the chips, then how did the Undead King get SO away from him?) one could come to no other conclusion than that the necro was just &quot;messing with&quot; the noobs who wandered too near to him in that zone.  Don't say you haven't seen or heard of THAT happening before....? &lt;wink&gt;<br />
<br />
I'll go back to my Oasis scenario. How many times have I destroyed three or four kited Specs in Oasis because some potato-head quad-kiter dragged them over the mid-teen newbies, using them as speed bumps?  I give a tell to the putz in question and let him know that &quot;if I catch him doing sh*t like that again, I'll sit on Spec Island and kill every friggin Spec as it spawns.  Donals Arms and a Manastone make it VERY easy. Please learn how to pull your stuff more safely.&quot;  I rarely get grief in return because usually I catch a guilty party.  Usually.<br />
<br />
And as far your opinion of what happened, you are right.  There's a chance, however small, that I might have been wrong. I admit it. I doubt it, but I admit it.<br />
<br />
And there's also a chance that OJ didn't *really* kill those two folks. &lt;wry grin&gt;<br />

Any chance that necro was just waiting for a friend to show up and killing time there?<br />
<br />
Any chance that same necro was just playing around and fearing mobs there?<br />
<br />
Can we just assume you trained him? Not really assuming it you admitted it.<br />
<br />
It's one thing if you see someone training someone (i.e. oasis like you mentioned before). It's another when you just guess. I still find it laughable that you can just see one person sitting some place and assume that they did something when you have nothing to back that up with except guesses.<br />

<br />
We can argue this until we're blue in the face.  Neither of us are going to change the other's mind. I like to take matters into my own hands - call it a character flaw if you would like.  I'd much rather say &quot;I tried and failed&quot; than have to suffer through the response &quot;I didn't want to risk anything&quot;. Bah.  I choose to help, be it retroactively (rezzing) or proactively (many ways).<br />
<br />
Again, we chose different paths with our characters.  You seem to believe in the fact that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. That's cool. But I don't.  I believe that some folks are just douchebags from the moment they wake up until the moment they go to bed.  And some of these folks have found their way into EQ.  <br />
<br />
And I'll be damned if I let one of them off the hook when I have the chance to do something about it. I wish that someone did that much for ME when I was growing up and getting trampled upon by LOTS of folks who didn't care.<br />

Having some measure of proof other than assuming guilt also helps. As for the Specs thing, I often run through Oasis on my way to Rathe... often I'll stop and derail spec trains. I've been asked, not more than once, whether I started the train... no I didn't, I was trying to help stop it! Imagine if one of them had made the assumption you did and decided to send their favourite bard to train a Sand Giant or ten while I was lom. I mean, hey, it doesn't matter if I was guilty or not, I -may- have trained the docks with specs right? Maybe you live in China and do not think the right to a fair trial is an intrinsic human right, but hey... who cares, I'm morally supreme: I am judge, jury and executioner!</div></div><hr />

Begging, cursing, training other people, just generally asking to be dealt with.  The necromancer was just doing the whole zone a favor.<br />
<br />
What, you say the magician wasn't doing all this?  Prove it.  Guilty until innocent, remember, so it's all the newbie's fault.</div></div><hr />

Corii, <br />
Ahh.. you might be right.  I think I may have read that the wrong way. Thanks.<br />
<br />

I *did* have a pretty good idea what happened.  Unlike a court, however, I don't have to wait for all the legel proceedings and piles of lawyers to deduce what transpired and act accordingly.  By that time, the player in question would have grown old and died of natural causes.<br />
<br />
Go to Oasis and watch the evil folks dragging Specs up and down the beach, using newbies as speed bumps.  Go to Karnors where people drag stuff into the Hand room in order to force the current group to evac and thus take the camp spot.  There are dozens and dozens of situations where people take advantage of other peoples' weaknesses.  It's sad but it happens.  I've seen this over and over again.. so if you want to color me &quot;disgraceful&quot; for taking matters into my own hands instead of /petitioning and waiting like an imbecile for a Guide to show up and tell you &quot;they have to see it happen first-hand&quot;, then go ahead.<br />
<br />
I've saved TONS of folks from miserable nights and helped more people than I can possibly remember.  And it's moments like this - when I can proactively stop someone from being a miserable SOB to someone else - which makes me proud to say that I stick up for my friends without pause or remorse. <br />
<br />
And the simple fact that he *never* complained about me speaks VOLUMES about the fact that he knew he was doing someone dirty.<br />

Who needs to be certain of facts when we can just guess, and then brag while claiming moral superiority?  Daku may have been absolutely correct in all of his guesses, after all.<br />
<br />
And, if he was wrong, it's just another necro.  Who cares if he may have just gotten there and had nothing to do with Daku's friend?  It's a necro, he deserves to have his night ruined.<br />
<br />
After all, ruining people's nights is what EQ is all bout, right?<br />
<br />
Even though I agree with Daku's actions, I don't agree with your statement saying:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a necro, he deserves to have his night ruined.&quot;<br />
<br />
That's just plain ignorance.. not all Necros are bad. I've helped people many times with nothing in return, and my primary is a necro. That's like saying you're a Female Cleric, you're only job in life is to summon food and drink, and that's what you deserve. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">08-30-2001, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was kind of the point of that post - it was supposed to show ignorance.  That's the problem with sarcasm, it doesn't translate to text well.  I'll try to lay it on even more thick next time.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
If Daku had bothered to find out what was really going on, instead of just going off half-cocked, then there would have been much less opposition to his actions.<br />
<br />
The fact his, he formulated a hypothesis, didn't bother to even ATTEMPT to verify it, and proceeded to train someone based on that unproven hypothesis.<br />
<br />
Was his hypothesis correct?  Probably.  Is &quot;probably&quot; good enough to cause another player grief?  Some of us don't think so.  I think training someone without even trying to verify the facts to be even more ignorant than disliking necros because they're necros.<br />
<br />
But, since you agree with training people only on assumptions and no investigation, I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mildaene</div><div class="date">08-31-2001, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;So here I was in Chessboard, farming bone chips (it's not the best place in the world, but since I was busy reading a book at the same time, the spawn rate was good enough for me), when the King popped while I was fighting 3  other skeletons. I feared him to be rid of him for a few minutes, and quickly dispatched his henchmen. Alas the king never came back, supposed someone killed him.<br />
A few minutes later, this guy comes to me, and before I can even greet him, promptly dumps a dwarf train on me. So nice of him!&quot;<br />
<br />
Think that theory is as good as the &quot;evil skeleton charmer&quot; one? Of course we'll never know, since ya didn't bother to find out!<br />
<br />
Well I hope I'll never run into someone like that, who thinks training people because he guessed they might have done something wrong is perfectly fine, without even botherin to find out what REALLY happened (oh ever tried to use fear at the chesboard, and see what direction they run to btw?).<br />
<br />
What ya did was wrong, braggin about it makes it worse. It was akin to shootin your neighbour because your window was broken when ya came home, and ya thought your neighbour was responsible (without ever askin him... he might not have done it, and who could ya exact revenge on then?).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daku inochi</div><div class="date">09-04-2001, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mildaene -  What the heck kind of analogy is that? &lt;LOL&gt; I didn't kill the neighbor for breaking my window.  I broke his window in return.<br />
  <br />
Here's the way you SHOULD have setup your analogy:<br />
<br />
The neighbor just bought a pile of rocks and had them delivered to his backyard. I came home and found his kids throwing those same rocks around.  Then I noticed that my window was broken by one of those rocks.  So I threw that rock back at his house, breaking his window in return.  No, I didn't see or catch the kid throwing it.  But I don't have to be psychology professor to come to the same conclusion anyone else would.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next time, neighbor, watch where your ****ing rocks land.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, my response in-game is not the one I would have used in real life. Go figure!<br />
<br />
While I do appreciate your input, if you're going to use real-life situations to describe something then please make sure you are comparing apples with apples!  &lt;wink&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daku inochi</div><div class="date">09-05-2001, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay.. I still think your analogy its WAY out of proportion (I guess it should be.. he broke my window, I broke six of his) but I'll roll with it since it's your opinion and opinions cannot be wrong. But now *I* get make the reference to the analogy of Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima/Nagasaki.  Those two moments in time were the start and end points of that minor difference of opinions commonly called WW2 (with Japan).<br />
<br />
My response to them(him)? &quot;Tough shiite. Feck you.  Next time, don't attack us(my buddy).&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit:  Oh, and it's not the loss of experience at level 9 that bothered me but the fact that this soured my buddy's opinion of people and the game itself. This loss of morale is FAR more devastating than the slight loss of experience in 38.<br />

Hell, he didn't even know he was trained (if he was at all).<br />
<br />
Sorry, you got revenge.  Nothing wrong with that, IMO, but it's not some noble ideal of upholding fairness, or morale or whatever.<br />
<br />
At first I thought what you did was great.  But after seeing more input in this post, I think you assumed too much.  Just hope others don't do this to you in the future.  If they do, don't get mad at them....since you think they have every right to do it based on assumptions they make.<br />

Of course I told him what happened.  I sit next to him 2 days a week! Heck, he reads most of the stuff I post over my shoulder and laughs his butt off.  &lt;grin&gt; And yes his morale was bolstered by my defending him.<br />
<br />
Again, we all react differently to different circumstances.  You can disagree with me all you want.  It wasn't about revenge - it was a &quot;don't mess with the newbies and especially my friends&quot; lesson.  I think I said that plainly a few posts ago, didn't I?<br />

<br />
I can't blame you for getting back at someone for dissing your friend.  I CAN think that you were quick to pass judgement on someone without even talking to them first.<br />
<br />
Just imagine if our legal system worked like that....<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw him in the area at the time of the crime.  I couldn't figure how anyone could have done it and couldn't come up with a good reason for him to be there, so he must be guilty.&quot;<br />
<br />
We can all hope you were right and that guy was a rat bastard who got what he derseved.  But what if you were wrong?<br />
<br />
Just hope no one assumes you're the guilty one next time.<br />
