<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolevii</div><div class="date">10-31-2001, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im trying to organize an attempt at Trak for my guild, in part to see how we stack up against him, and also to learn some more.  I have a few questions tho:<br />
<br />
~Are there any ways for casters to get out of the AoE, or will I just need to get thier PR up high and rune em a tad?<br />
<br />
~What makes Trak do the Trak touch?  If its highest on aggro...CoTh can save that person and I can do groups accordindly.<br />
<br />
~ How many adds, if any, should I be prepared for?<br />
<br />
Any tips or ways you guys like to do him would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
I believe the Trak Touch is used on a set timer (45 seconds?) and I believe that it's whoever has the highest aggro.  Using a larger force of people, Trak Touches are not what kills you since it sends a very small amount of people out of the fight.  It's his AOE and melee (primarily the AOE).<br />
<br />
If pulled properly, you should not have any adds when fighting him.<br />
<br />
Finally, you want to fight him in his lair.  Towards the end of the fight, he'll try to gate.  If you're in his Lair, that risk is greatly reduced and even if he does Gate, you're right there to finish him off.<br />

Also, you can take your twinks to Kaesora and kill spiders and they drop a single use poison cure.  Very handy for trak raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's taking about 1.5 bubs of mana to cast, so I'm looking at only getting 3 (maybe 4 with some medding) spells off during the battle.  Can he be killed that fast?<br />
<br />
Also, should I use my divines between casts so that I don't take any damage myself?<br />
<br />
Feel free to educate me, I'd rather learn than make a mistake during the raid.<br />

Grats Fuz  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
it depends on how long the fight lasts and the level and resist of your teammates. If Trak is not down after 3 WoR, you might be in trouble  <br />
<br />
It's taking about 1.5 bubs of mana to cast, so I'm looking at only getting 3 (maybe 4 with some medding) spells off during the battle.  Can he be killed that fast?<br />
<br />
First of all, i dont recommend medding druing the battle. Nothing worse than being ported to shroom area with 2/3 your mana or FM. If you have good force, Trak can be down within 40sec-1min, 3 WoR should be enough. (remind your group dont scatter out of healing range, dont mix tanks and casters in a group if possible etc.) <br />
<br />
Also, should I use my divines between casts so that I don't take any damage myself?<br />
<br />
Group Healing - big aggro (compare to single target heal)<br />
DA - aggro<br />
DB - higher aggro (comparing DA)<br />
sit/med - biggest aggro<br />
<br />
If you WoR, DA and sit/med immeditately, it could be a nice taunt  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone should be casting/fighting basically under Trak's belly.  If he ping pongs even once, there's a 99.999% chance that you will fail.<br />
<br />
After first poison and once people start taking damage, get under Trak and do a WoR.  Then hit DA real fast cause Trak will almost surely be all over you.  Click it off once you know he's off you and you need to heal.  Likely will need to do WoR right away too.  Be ready to do DB again (if timed right, you can miss all the AOE's with DA/DB).  Click it off, 3rd WoR... If Trak isn't dead by this point, you were going to fail anyway.  He's often dead after the 2nd WoR...<br />
<br />
Lots more info I could give, but I think this generally covers it heh.<br />
<br />
Oh and Trak touch is on highest aggro, usually first tank and then later a rogue, ranger, or 2nd tank.  Recycle time is about 15 seconds.  Slow raid you will loose max 4 to Trak touch, good fast kill you only loose 2.<br />

<br />
Situation 1) We all run in, tanks start whacking, his AoE hurts a lot of people in my group.  I group heal, one second later he lifetaps me for 1700? and doubles for 400-odd each.  Dead cleric.<br />
Situation 2) We all run in, tanks start whacking, his AoE hurts a lot of people in my group.  I group heal, and as soon as the heal is finished I leap on the DA button.  Too late, shroomed.  Dead cleric.<br />
Situation 3) We all run in, tanks start whacking, his AoE hurts a lot of people in my group.  I drop a few celestial heals, 1-2 divine lights, then Trak falls over dead.  Alive cleric.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story?  Don't use group heals on Trak  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

I was just on a Trak raid on Monday. We all ran in, his AE came about 15 seconds after we all engaged, i WORed and didnt get aggro. The main tank even died and i didnt get aggroed at all, even after casting WOR a 2nd time. Maybe i was just really lucky /shrug :P <br />

last 20 Trak run i die maybe 2 or 3 times.<br />
<br />
i got ported to shroom once:<br />
charge Trak - WoR - DB &amp; Sit - 2nd WoR - Trak bites me - DA - Shroom - Gate to Orb - Trak down dam i am in orb alone  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
at lv58 with 160+ pr, you can resist most its AE posion and its melee is weak and SLOW.<br />
at lv60 i no longer bother resist gears, 140~ pr (buffed) is good enough.</div></div><hr />

Haven't really had any trouble getting DA off... course buffed I have like 1300ac and 4000hps or so, not uber but good enough.<br />
<br />
Worst thing I've seen clerics do lately, is start group healing when their group is barely hurt and before tanks get solid aggro and before he is debuffed heh.  They die fast this way...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaharz</div><div class="date">11-08-2001, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did my first Trak last night here is how it was done.<br />
<br />
We had I think 6 groups.  4 of them were tanks, debuffers, and the highest clerics.  The other two were nukers and the two lowest clerics (me being one of those).<br />
<br />
I don't know how they got the prot single since I didn't get to witness it, but apparently one monk pulled trak back and another pulled the prot then FDed and had it peeled (the peel was to soon and we ended up with 3 Jugg adds a reet pop, but with our large force and good chanters it wasn't a problem).<br />
<br />
After the prot was out of the way we went up to the bridge.  A pally was singled out to RD pull trak back to the back left corner of lair.  Pallys seem to be best for this since with DA and LoH they can last a decent amount.  Pally yelled when first AoE went off which was single for 1st wave (tanks, debuffers, and their clerics to move in and engage).  Then the main tank waited for next AoE and called in 2nd wave (nukers and their clerics).  Trak went down just after his 3rd AoE.  We were told that a 4th AoE would probably mean that everyone would die after Trak did if not before.  To ensure against this one cleric stayed on the cliff across the water from bridge to run in and res if everyone died from the DoT after trak died.<br />
<br />
When the waves were running into the lair it was important to hug the left wall tight to avoid adds.  Avoiding the adds was also the reason for the pally giving his life to pull Trak back into the left rear corner.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is the best tactic, since I have no other experience to compare it to.  This is just the one we used and it worked well but we also had a lot of people there.<br />
Oh yea, and as soon as Trak dies, remeber that some people are still taking dmg from DoTs so try to heal them.  I lost the mage in my group post-kill and almost died myself due to lack of mana.<br />
