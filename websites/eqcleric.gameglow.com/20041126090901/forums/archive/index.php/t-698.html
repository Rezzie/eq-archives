<br />
 Just use your magical hammer bestowed upon you by your deity, and tap the creature you want as a pet on the head, and presto! Instant pet. <br />
<br />
Want to be a Necro? Tap a skeleton.<br />
Want to be a Shaman? Tap a wolf.<br />
Want to be a Mage? Tap an elemental.<br />
<br />
  While in the commons the other day I used this exact method to &quot;charm&quot; a wolf, and like a loyal puppy he would follow me wherever i went playfuly nipping at my back. He wasn't very obedient though, I'd tell him to attack something, and all he wanted to do was play. <br />
<br />
Perhaps with further experimentation, or obedience school I'll be able to get my pet to attack another. Perhaps a natural enemy like orcs, and undead in North Ro perhaps.<br />
