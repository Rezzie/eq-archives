I'm a Dark Elf Cleric and I want some Plane of Hate gear... Now, what do I do to get that? A. Invade my own god's plane; B. Kill my own god's creatures; C. Loose factions (I think it's possible). Now, why should I be FORCED to invade my god's plane to get some nice stuff?! The point is, Verant should open a Plane of Love or something and put all the PoH/PoF gear in it so evil races can get it.<br />

Moving most of the cleric items to the plane of hate was just wrong to us.  Least they could do it leave them on both planes.  I love playing my Dark Elf, but I now believe that I took the wrong race.  Yes I was told that my race/class was going to be difficult to play, but the stand veriant has taken on Dark Elves and Cleric has made me want to cancel my account.  Currently if it would not be for my guild/friends, I would no longer play EQ.<br />

Where would you expect a Dark Elf to find all the best items..  on the Dark Elves who are higher than them..   and secondly..  Hate is generic..  its not exclusive..  Innorruk hates everything..  even his own minions.. <br />
and the nature of evil is to compete with itself..  <br />
in my opinion all of the above justify anything that Dark Elf Clerics have to go through to get their high level  stuff<br />

DEs should not lose faction in the zone.<br />

Dark Elf clerics have NO quests at all. go to the guild and hail everyone there. 4 trainers, about a dozen vendors, 4 guards. Nobody will answer your hail. There is not a single quest.<br />
<br />
This is where you all bring up  Thex Mallet right? Well that is a Shadowknight quest and does not even compare to the &quot;good&quot; races quests and weapons. lets compare. we can do the shadowknight thex mallet quest. Good races (depending on who you are) can do Bullsmasher, Shining Star of Light, Screaming Mace, Observer Staff.<br />
<br />
This is where you say that we can do these too if we increase our faction. Well, why in the hell would a Dark Elven Priestess increase her faction and HELP the races that persecute us and KOS us? Certainly some might chose to betray the dark elven race and innoruuk and TRY this, but when was the last time you saw a Dark Elf walking around Kelethin or Kaladim? It may not even be possible.<br />
<br />
so etheral mist is just another kick in the rear. The way that i see it, there is no cleric guild in neriak for us. Just a place to buy spells. No conversations, no quests, no nothing.<br />
<br />
and when you are told &quot;high difficulty&quot; when you create your character it is based upon your race primarily. find a dark elf character that is not high difficulty. It seems that verant forgot about us Dark Elven Clerics when they were creating quests for everyone else in neriak.<br />
<br />

I personally think it bites that we have to kill them to get the stuff, AT LEAST there should be no faction loss involved.<br />

Just because our god is the patron of hate, does not mean we hate each other.  Its our job to plant the seeds of hate in others.  To do this we work together, not against each other.<br />
From the notions you have of what being a priest of Innoruuk is, lets look at say a priest of Erolissi Marr.  Um, wait if I posted that the post would have to been deleted.  You get the idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
The following is copied directly from the EQ players guide:<br />
<br />
<br />
Followers of Innrouuk include nearly the entire Dark Elven race who regard him as their &quot;Father.&quot;  They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather &quot;the&quot; creative force in the universe.  Creativity born of destruction.  Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain it.  It is only through the total disdain of your enemies that you can gain true power over them.  Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest belief of the followers of Innoruuk that if they were to hate strong enough they could destroy all of Norrath.</div></div><hr />
