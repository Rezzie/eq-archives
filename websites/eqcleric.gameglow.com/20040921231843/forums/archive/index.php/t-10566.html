<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">05-10-2001, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I discovered a couple collegues from work had done the server switch and one of them was 35th level SK. Thinking of places we could fight, I took him to SolA where we found a lvl 30 warrior looking for a group.<br />
<br />
The three of us headed in. All the beginning stuff con'd blue to me and I got good exp from them, but the SK did not (not sure of the warrior).<br />
<br />
We headed further and deeper in, mainly because I wanted to try for a blackened guardian shield and saw it listed as a drop on the map.<br />
<br />
Once we hit the gnomes, the SK got good exp (they con'd even/yellow and one or two reds). My exp was soaring and it was easy to keep them alive. I hated killing gnomes, but they started it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif. At least I don't condem dark elves on sight.<br />
<br />
In any case, I gained three bubbles of exp in about 3 hours of travel through SolA and was making so much money that I had to leave tons of loot on the bodies. I think I came out of there with about a hundred plat for three hours work.<br />
<br />
In the next couple days we'll stay away from the gnomes and kill goblins, though I still want the shield.<br />
<br />
Overall I like it here so far  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif. My faction dropped from allied to indifferent from the gnome deaths, and as far as I know I've not ruined the faction completly.</div></div><hr />
