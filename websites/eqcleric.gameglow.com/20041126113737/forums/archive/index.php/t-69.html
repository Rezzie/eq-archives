This is my first time posting here so if this post seems a litte amatuerish well....it probably is.  I've read alot of the stuff that is here and check this bulletin board daily and I've gotta say that you people are the most experienced players that I've ever met.  Well, to get to the point, I need a little help on where to get exp at level 20.  I group with a level 20 ranger, level 20 bard, and level 18 warrior regularly and am currently at Mistmoore but the exp there is a bit slow and since all of us are barely in the 20's we have to stay at the very front of the place which gets trained often and not very fun if you know what I mean.  <br />
Is there anywhere that we can go for better exp?<br />
Your advice has always been top notch so don't fail me now http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

I started there at 19 with a 19 ranger partner, and we stayed til 28th.  You don't mention what races people are, but you can bind the non-evils in the Arena zone in Lake Rathe.  I recommend binding yourself in the CT courtyard, behind the tree on the north wall.  This is a *very* safe spot - I have never had anything aggro me there (as opposed to B. Hurd and his Spectre friends outside).<br />
<br />
Get a nice spot in the CY, and send the ranger forth into the maze to pull defenders.  Might take you a try or three to get a hang of the zone, but it's niiiiiiiiice exp.</div></div><hr />

I have been there since lvl 29, but am now nearing the end of my time here.  I have noticed alot of lower lvl characters hunting there recently.  But, I also see them dying quite a bit to trains...and the occasional gator that stops to chomp on them as it is being pulled to the zone line to be killed.  With the release of Kunark, and the changing of paw, the aviak area in South Karana doesn't seem to be camped as much anymore.  You could try lower lvl aviaks in a group.  HighHold pass killing orcs at the kith zone line would be good as well, in a group.  Aviak guards in Lake Rathe are good exp if you can get one of the spawns.  Skels and Drybones are good at night in Lake Rathe at the ruins near the Sk zone line.  These are all good hunting areas for folks around lvl 20.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bennan</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestions would be Runneye Citadel. It is normally deserted so you could possibly have the run of the place.<br />
<br />
Or maybe Dagnars Cauldron, killing those Aqua gobs could net some good xp. And if you get sick of that you could move into Unrest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reviver</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try Upper Guk, Permafrost, Runnyeye,  Najena or Unrest. I hunted in Upper Guk and Runnyeye a lot from lvl 20 to mid 20s. For Upper Guk, you could try doing the Squire spawn area which isn't very far from the zone or head on to the scryer room. As for Runnyeye, you could fight your way down to the warlord room and hold it. Like any dungeon, never let anything escape.<br />
<br />
Since you have a regular group, it would be nice to explore dungeons which are suitable for you and aren't very crowded. I had loads of fun exploring Upper Guk and Runnyeye back at the lvl 20s. It's fun and there were few times when we went in too deep, got very lost and died.<br />
<br />
Hehe ... or if you're feeling adventurous, just zone into Sol A, the mob that wanders near the zone will be blue to you. ANd a little way down the steps you'll even find some even or yellow cons for your level.<br />
<br />
For outdoor zones, I've not hunted in many of them at your level with the exception of Lake Rathe  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Hope this helps  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
I went there with a 4 person group that was exactly the same level and composure (well, druid instead of ranger).  We cleaned up.<br />
<br />
Have the bard pull, they have a lull song that works wonders in the flag room.<br />
<br />
You should be able to sweep from the entrance up to (and possible into) the flag room, then work your way back.  It's a 28 minute respawn time in there (or was back in September, that may have changed).<br />
<br />
Perma is out of the way though, with closest place to bind being Halas.<br />

Aviaks there are good xp and fair loot.  You can move on to gnolls at the spires is a few levels and they are great xp and drop FS.  You can also try HH or HHK.<br />

<br />
Get your cleric icon first (scryer room, right hand column as you face the scryer's platform).  Do this before killing froggies or anything in guk, for that matter.<br />
<br />
See the thread on Lower Guk to understand why I mention faction.  If you ever plan on doing Lower Guk, and have killed a live frog- your run through to L Guk will be made more difficult.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ortheao</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I killed my faction in Upper Guk helping a friend get his Ghoul Bane who later made a wizard and sold his GB to twink his Wizard =( I'm still kicking myself for that because I can't invis and go the Lower Guk for a pick up group.  Have to spend money on invis potions now.<br />
<br />
My group did Runnyeye at that level and did well.  Most of the Blackend Iron pieces don't sell well, but at the warlord room you can get a Blacken Iron Medallion which I still use, and the boots which sell for some good cash because it let's melee classes kick beasts that are only touched by magic weapons like ghouls and wisps.  Sometimes the Blackend Iron Crown drops in the warlord room too.  My group ended up with four of them after about a week in RE.<br />
<br />
I recomend Runnyeye because not only will it be good for xp, but really good experience for how things work in a dungeon.  Tanks bind close in Rivervale (if they are not evil).  The group learns it's role by not letting any runners go and what happens when one does get loose (which will happen).  That kind of thing sets you up for things like Cazic and Sol A where you don't want to wait for your tanks to hike through the Inky woods or run all the way from Freeport to CT.<br />
<br />
I didn't do Permafrost much, but I gather it's much like Runnyeye.<br />

Ditto here.  I'm a big Unrest fan; I'm not sure why.  I KNOW it's trainy and I KNOW it can be scary, but I just like the little things about it, I guess -- especially the secret Scooby Doo style bookcase entrance to the basement.<br />
<br />
Level 20 would be excellent for Unrest.  I fought there on and off from about 19 to 30ish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos Inglorion</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Solo gorge hounds in east karana.  No loot, but pretty easy to root and smite a hound.  If you get in trouble, just run back to the guards in the town near the gorge, or better yet, pull the hound in close to the town before you blast in earnest.  Just root and shoot.  Those hounds will give good experience while solo up through level 24.  Boring, perhaps, but solo experience is better than group experience.  You will probably have to smite the hounds five or six times to kill them.  Med and repeat.  Watch out for griffs, evil eyes, and cyclopses, all fairly rare near the gorge town.  Lion Patriarchs are probably still blue at 20, but the guards won't kill lions.<br />
<br />
When you get bored, go into the gorge and group up for evil eye hunting near the throne of King Xorbb.  That's a lot of fun.  Those evil eyes look nasty, but the unnamed ones have no more hps than a gorge hound.  Watch out for charm, and those very fun push effects that throw you halfway across the chamber.</div></div><hr />
