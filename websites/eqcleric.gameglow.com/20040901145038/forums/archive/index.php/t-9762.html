<br />
    Today i was trying to fing and kill Zahal and Regis for my bracers(try is all i did too),when i hear a shout of &quot;someone come kill Grimfeather&quot;.After a few seconds a high lvl asks for his loc and goes and kills the big mean bird thing.Well the lower lvls thank the guy and i go back to clearing undead.Then about 6 minutes later i hear another shout of &quot;Grimfeather to wood bridge&quot;.About now im thinking &quot;Wow i wish our spawns were as fast as that&quot;.Well a group takes him out and alls well in NK again.Then about an hour and a half later,i stand up to clear the next spawn of undead and guess who is just on the other side of the pillar?Thats right,our good buddy Grimfeather.When i see that i just log in disgust.<br />
<br />
       Now maybe im missing something,but doesnt it seem logical to have all the quest NPCs spawn like Gimfeather?Why only the ranger NPC?Wouldnt you just die if you were in befallen and Babbinsbort spawned and you missed him,but then to your surprise he spawns again 6 minutes later?Doesnt seem too much to ask for in my opinion.<br />

He is on the spawn tables for multiple spawns, the only limiter is that there can only be one Grimfeather at a time. I was looking for Zahal one night and killed Grimfeather, while waiting for a ranger to come loot, another Grimfeather spawned in view of me. there were 5 or 6 Grimfeather spawns in about an hour that night. Like you, I loged out pissed. heh<br />
I was running through Rathe mountains and saw a named cyclops, killed it and saw it had one of the ranger items on it. I checked to see how many rangers were in the zone, there were 4+ a couple anon. The cyclops corpse poofed because all the rangers in the zone had the final product of the quest, and some even had a spare item off the cyclops.....<br />

Try Thistle Underbrush in lfay for the ranger breastplate.  I've died a couple of times to him...now, he's easy enough to kill mind you, but when you kill him and he spawns on top of you within 30 seconds, he can pose a problem.  This has happened to me 4 times myself now.  And if you like that, get what I heard from a GM on him one time...Thistles pathing takes him into the ranger camp, but not against all of them, but only one named Vlynn (I think that's his name)...anyhow, they fight, Thistle wins with around 50% health...so if you're patient enough, not only do you have a spawn that spawns repeatively, but you get him handed to you with 1/2 life.  Maybe I should make a ranger. hehe<br />

I have just started a cleric char (which has brought me to this board). So I can't claim to know all the ins and outs of getting thier class-specific armor. I have heard that clerics have gotten the shaft generally, but haven't gotten to the point where I'm going to get my own armor.<br />
<br />
I have however played a Ranger to lvl 30, so I think I can offer some insight into the thier armor quests. I don't mean this as a &quot;Ranger's have it just as bad as everyone else&quot; post. Thier armor probably _is_ easier to get than most everyone elses (maybe the easiest, but I think warriors or shamans have that title). I just wanted to toss a couple of things out.<br />
<br />
1) Wiltin Windwalker. This is the fellow Rangers have to camp to get thier leggings. Hop on over to The Ranger's Glade message boards at http://www.soerbaird.com/ranger  to see how fun this fella is to camp. So, not every item is easy to get for rangers. Some definitly are easy (bracers). Some are moderate (helm). Some are hard (arms, tunic). Some are insane (legs). Some are not worth getting (boots, gloves).<br />
<br />
2) Rangers have very few options to strap on for armor that give them decent AC. Rubicite (and we all know the deal with this armor), and some SolB, LGuk, and now KK items. No bronze, no plate. This really hurts thier ability to tank. Hurts thier contribution to a group. And costs clerics more mana to heal them.<br />
<br />
This is definitly not intended as a flame. Just wanted to offer some perspective from the ranger side of things   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif.<br />

Your info on the Thistle Underbrush/Ranger fight isn't necessarily accurate.  I was in LF last week, camping the Sisters, and ran off to the Ranger Station to sell... while I was there I suddenly heard a fight break out, and watched the text scroll by as Thistle and the Ranger (can't recall his name) duked it out... the Ranger won after a rather protracted battle.  Didn't target him to check his health.  But Thistle doesn't win ALL the time.<br />

<br />
Well, I dont know about all that ranger stuff, but let me tell you that after hours of sheer boredom, I started keeping track of my activities while hunting ONE mob for ONE piece of cleric quest armor, Gull Skytalon, needed for the cleric vambraces.<br />
<br />
Total Hours quested for (real-time, over a 2.5 week period): 62<br />
<br />
Total Aviaks Killed (All deep green, no xp at all): 1186 (plus one, if you want to include Gull himself, also this number could be off by as much as 5%, for my estimate before I started tracking each and every one killed)<br />
<br />
Total Loots (Bankable loots, had to destroy Cp, sp, no place to bank in OoT, too far to travel to Freeport to bank when full, also destroyed all rusty weapons and sold other loots to indiff faction vendor): 226 plat<br />
<br />
Total XP gained from this quest (Cleric armor quests all give zero xps, and all the aviaks are green): ZERO <br />
<br />
Also, it might not be the best evidence, but consider how many bards you see in all blue outfits, how many rangers you see in all green, then consider how many clerics you see in all gold? I have all the armor but the Breastplate and the Bracers, and I get inspected ALL the time by people asking me what it is, simply because they have not seen it before.<br />
<br />
This ain't no flame, or an angry post, just the facts. If you want the cleric armor, get ready to perform MULTIPLE quests, all of are very similar to the above. &amp;lt;sigh&amp;gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">01-03-2000, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, it's kind of a pity I did not know about this island earlier. It would have been a cool place to gain some xps.<br />
<br />
The Aviaks are not aggro unless you are already fighting, and there are always numerous ones to pull.<br />
<br />
Here is the range as near as I can figure. (I might be WAY off here, but it's the best I can do. When you're 34, they are all green.)<br />
<br />
Aviak Starlings: Level 12 to 14ish? About 240  hit points.<br />
<br />
Aviak Turacos: 15 to 17ish? <br />
<br />
Aviak Tanagers: 18 to 20ish?<br />
<br />
Avaik Quetzels: 21 to 25ish? (at 34, the very highest lvl Quetzels would still give xp, a very very insignificant amount)<br />
<br />
There are no other mobs on the island of any kind, no snakes, no bats, nothing.<br />
<br />
There are wanderers that move around the island all alone, so it's easy to pull. Little chance of getting 3 birds at once.<br />
<br />
As for loots, the occasional Aviak will have a rusty, sometimes a bronze weapon. (Every Aviak I killed with a mace had a bronze one, not rusty. Swords were mostly rusty.)<br />
<br />
Some Aviaks just had a few copper, right up to 6 gold per Aviak, sometimes the Quetzels would have up to 3 plat or so.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
Dear Mr. Ranger quester:<br />
<br />
Clearly you have not made any more than a cursory analysis of the cleric quests vs. the ranger quests. Hmmm, rangers have 1 - count 'em - ONE insane NPC camp.<br />
<br />
A brief list of completely insane cleric NPC camps:<br />
<br />
Bilge (the classic)<br />
Maugarim<br />
Gull Skytalon<br />
Zahal &amp; Regis (really fun when there are two bracers to get, imagine trying this twice)<br />
Babbinsport<br />
... and of course 8 hour ground spawns in Kithicor, Upper Guk, Everfrost, and Mistmoore among others, much fun on terminally overcrowded servers<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I get so many ranger quest items during my normal xp/loot hunting that I am ready to throw up.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Greggery<br />
bored stiff at a level when I should be having fun with interesting quests, you know, as in EverQUEST?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">01-04-2000, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can kinda vouch for this. I've been looking for Zahal/Regis for like what, every night I'm online passing through NK, and have bound on the NE corner before, just in the hopes that hopping in I'll stumble across Regis.<br />
<br />
Babbinsbort is like so overcamped on my server it's not funny.<br />
<br />
I think we have 1 cleric on sol ro with all the armor, haven't seen him or know his name, but I've heard of it. People know I'm seeking the armor out, and they've been sending me tells when they see him. Me, I'm walking around with arms, legs boots and caduceus already, and find myself getting inspected all over, plus I've got people asking me how in the world I got three names and what all this yellow stuff is... Would've felt better if people knew what the quest armor was..<br />
<br />
Found some druid that was trying to sell the breastplate of the constant. I tell ya, that one will NEVER get a res from me. That breastplate is so hard to come by. I think maybe 3 clerics on my entire server have it.<br />
<br />
The legs, a few are starting to turn up legs, and people are camping Maugarim, which is ok, as they're getting them for cleric friends. They're not openly selling it at all. This armor isn't sold often on our server, except for maybe the boots.<br />
<br />
I see totally green rangers running around, and I can't tell you how many redwind runes go to waste, as I've been playing with icy orcs grouping with friends for downtime between HG and spec hunts. <br />
<br />
I guess some of our quests ARE insane. I've gotten some info from a level 50 druid that might help on Bilge and if it does, I'll pass it along. I'm going to test it tonight and hope I don't get slaughtered. And that level 50? When I get xp resses available, they've got one anytime they want one, even if I have to run all over thwe continent to do it. They hunt bilge alot, and you know what she does with the cleric quest parts? Starts auctioning it to clerics in zone for free. That earns my respect. It's what I do with the redwinds and the cyclops charms and the grifenne feathers, etc... If I need something for a guildmember, I'll run the quest for them, but if I don't need it, I'll /occ the loc and let them come loot. I'll be off hunting something else  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
