<br />
Some of you might know that the Tribunal server had a two day rollback due to multiple drive crashes. My own loss was limited to three bubbles of XP during Hell Level 30 and the Charred Guardian Shield from Solusek, so I do not have much to complain about.<br />
<br />
Marv, however, had nailed Bilge and received the Breastplate of the Constant during those two days. I sympathize with his loss.<br />
<br />
Now everyone is running about, getting overly aggressive to make up for lost XP, and causing insane trains while shouting and ooc'ing their displeasure at Verant. I wish they would calm down and stop jeapordizing those around them.<br />
