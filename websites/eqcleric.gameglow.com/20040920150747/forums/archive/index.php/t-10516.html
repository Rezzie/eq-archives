Those levels seemed to fly by.  You are able to pull solo skeletons to the zone if you are solo.  But my best experience was with another cleric and a monk working the 3rd floor.  We were getting a bubble of exp every 45 minutes...<br />
<br />
One word of warning though.  Stay away from the basement.<br />
<br />
The first, second, and some of the third floor will start to go very low blue by level 20 or so.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamea</div><div class="date">01-15-2001, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I grouped with 2 monks, 2 shadow knights, and a necro. We were all level 14-16. We cleared the main floor to the top without needing to stop and med or rest (except me). Everything was blue to us so it was very easy, almost boring to some members. We went to the basement to kill Furbies (badger looking critters that squeak when hit). There are a couple of rooms that spawn 2 or 3 furbies which made it very tough for us. Also in the basement, there are a few tight, narrow halls and corners. At times I could not get a heal on a group member that was around a corner because others were blocking the hall. We only encountered one death the whole night (Monk was jumped by 3 furbies and poisoned when he went off into a room by himself).<br />
<br />
The following night, we stayed outside the tower, at the base of the ramp (five of us, levels 15-17). We pulled mobs from the train that walk by the tower (kinda like the Orc Highway in Oasis). We were getting whites and yellows for 3 hours of non stop killing. We stopped twice so each member could go afk for a break. It was very safe outside the tower.<br />
<br />
The loot was poor to fair, I got a 9 AC Rhino Hide Tunic. Most items were Iskar quest stuff, rusty weapons, gold-silver-copper, etc. <br />
<br />
I went from a fresh 14 to 16 solo in two nights, 16-19 in another two nights with a group. If you love to kill skels, then you gotta try this place. Undead Heaven !<br />
<br />
In 4 nights, I never died once (2 close calls when solo) and we only lost the one group member (his own fault). Use Devine Aura to save your life. The zone which is at the entrance to the tower is a great way to escape certain death whether you are hunting inside or outside.<br />
<br />
Beware the two pit holes in the basement. You Do NOT want to fall down those holes, 250 points of damage, plus you fall into a nest of nasty Furbies.<br />
<br />
Iskars do not have clerics, but they do have shamans. I only had 2 requests to join a group because they are not used to seeing many clerics in this zone; clerics level fast, then move to Lake of IllOmen.<br />
<br />
At level 19, you can easily solo here, but everything inside would be low blue or green. Outside, you can find blues and a white now and then. At level 20, I would leave for the Lake, unless you just can't get enough of those skels.<br />
<br />
Side note:<br />
A female dark elf shadow knight showed up and two Iskars (first time characters) asked me, &quot;What is that thing ? a player or mob ? Can we kill it ?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

After that, I don't think it is too profitable (everything starts turning green).  I would go to LoIO at 19.  Better xp and you usually can find a group.<br />
