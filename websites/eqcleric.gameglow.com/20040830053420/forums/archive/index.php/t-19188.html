 <br />
I have been in search of the right guild for me and my husband for so long but have had trouble with the Raid Schedules which seems to be mostly begin @ 7pm Eastern Time (4pm My Time) on Tholuxe Paells (which makes me late to every raid &amp; It Sucks), unless you are a European Guild which raids at even worse times for me<br />
<br />
We are even contemplating moving servers to find a place where we belong: Raid @ 6pm Pacific Time, Please! Or perhaps, there are many of you on Tholuxe Paells that have the same situation and are thinking about creating a guild for people like us called, &quot;Pacific Time Raiders&quot; (Wishful Thinking) - Do It Now!!! (LoL)<br />
<br />

Listing of ALL previous guild memberships: The Ascended (Just about from Beginning to End), Through The Never (Briefly) &amp; Eternal Sovereign (Briefly)<br />
<br />
I am...<br />
Exarch Miryum TaggleFist (Cleric (65) Highelf)<br />
&amp; my husband is...<br />
Marshall Fiddic TaggleFist (Warrior (65) Halfling)<br />
<br />
We have been playing EQ for approximately 3 to 4 years<br />
(He started it and got me in to it and now we are forever addicted to it)<br />
<br />
When I finally got in to it, after Fiddic had already begun, he belonged to a Guild &amp; therefore I joined that Guild immediately as EQ is something that we fully enjoy doing together :) The Guild was terrific! We stayed in it for many years before, for whatever reason, sadly...it desolved.<br />
<br />
I decided to take a break, as did Fiddic logging on at will to do LDoN adventures &amp; with no Raid schedule to keep, <br />
it was actually very satisfying having no commitments and we never let anyone down...<br />
<br />
It has been a year or so now and I have tried a couple of different Guilds since The Ascended but we were just not a good fit, mostly due to my RL schedule...in RL, timing is crucial &amp; the same goes with EQ for me...I live in Las Vegas (Pacific Time) &amp; I work full time in the Mortgage Industry, which can be quite demanding at times ~ <br />
I can usually sit down at the computer around 6pm Pacific Time Monday through Friday &amp; Anytime on Weekends<br />
<br />
Fiddic has had RL keeping him away from too much EQ Gameplay in the past due to his health (He was in an accident &amp; it has taken years for him to recover to where he is now which is semi-tolerable most of the time but can get flare up at times too...his pain is unpredictable so we may be off line a couple of weeks to heal at times too)<br />
Of course, I would stay in communication via web-site if this should occur<br />
<br />
* just being totally honest *<br />
<br />
If EQ becomes less like a Game and more like an Obligation, This is a sign of Trouble...<br />
While I take EQ &amp; my role as a Cleric Extremely Seriously,<br />
I Need EQ to Remain an Enjoyable Enhancement To My Life, Not Become My Life :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miryum</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The search still goes on, however I am not giving up on my server just yet...<br />
<br />
I am finding My Journey to a Guild to be very interesting in that I have had to open my narrow minded view up a bit!<br />
<br />
I have come in contact with a few smaller-sized guilds that, on their own may not be able raiding the content I am after, however they seem to be raiding on Pacific Time (Thank Tunare!) and since they are much smaller than the larger guild rading the content I am after, they have more of a family-like atmosphere which is how The Ascended used to be :)<br />
<br />
So how am I going to get the best of both worlds?<br />
<br />
Well...perhaps, there is something that is going on that some of you know about already - SGA<br />
<br />
SGA (Small Guild Alliance) has been formed and more smaller guilds are applying.  WHy, just the other day, I gave a tell to a member of a smaller guild and he said that they had 72 on their raid and that they were full (This is normally what you here with the bigger guilds - LoL).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the possibilities of having what I want may not be out of reach on my server afterall - we will just have to see...just thought I'd update you on my progress :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes, when you play EQ for so many years, the excitement is hard to find, so I appreciate this feeling and will do my best to hold on to it :)</div></div><hr />
