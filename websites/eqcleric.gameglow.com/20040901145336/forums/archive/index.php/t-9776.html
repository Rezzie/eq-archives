<br />
I was in Unrest ghost group tonight.  We get some bad luck and have to zone.  No biggie.  SOme dam druid moves in (in wolf form), takes room for a bit, leaves.  No big deal so far, other than with wolf he/she walked right in.<br />
<br />
Later, group tries to take the ghost room back.  We get to blood pool, only to find another dam druid walks into the ghost room, kills ghost, leaves.  WTF is that?  Greedy dam druid$.<br />
<br />
Our Divine series is &quot;balanced&quot; by us being vulnerable to stun.  Druid$ get wolf form, permanent non-KOS, invis.  Ya, thats balanced.  Way to go yet again Verant.  I thought this was supposed to be a social game?<br />
<br />
Hmm, lets see, druids got their tracking upped in last patch.  We get?  ZIP!<br />
<br />
Can you say pet class?<br />

It ups your faction a bit, but there are many places where I'm still KOS even with wolf form on.<br />
<br />
I will agree with you that there are a lot of people that will steal your camp, and unfortunately you'll likely find a Druid in there a lot of the time.  Many people start a Druid as a second since they are easy to solo and easy to give equip too (you can give a Druid level 30+ equip for less than 1000pp).  <br />
<br />
Please do remember that not all of us play the same way.  I yield places I'm camping 99% percent of the time, even though I get a whopping 6-10 hours a week to play max nad I relaly need the xp or item and it may be my only chance to even hold that spot.  I spend sometimes hours at a time being a wolf-friend to newbies and give away plat and items like I've won Regis' millionare show.  If you like I can tell you stories of Clerics who have let me die at their feet so they could hit the MOB for the last shot and gain the xp, but there is no reason to get into an discussion that will leave us both poorer for it.  <br />
<br />
I feel sorry that someone took your spot, and it was wrong, but it has been said before that the best and worst thing about EQ is the people.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">01-31-2000, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that there are different types of Clerics and Druids.  I was surprised to find a Druid who actually healed in a group over the weekend.  I have seen more than enough Clerics who nuked rather than the more dangerous healing also.  So far as a Pet class goes, I have to wonder why Druids were given an addition in their Tracking skill.  If you want to see how powerful Druids are, go to Ak’Anon and see a high level Druid kiting three gnome guards at a time.  Could a Cleric do this even with Journeyman Boots?  At this time, if you want to create a Cleric on a new server, you first create a Druid to make some money.  Ideally, you make the Druid on a separate account and use it to powerlevel and twink your Cleric.  Poor as a Cleric?  Why don’t you go bring your Druid on to make some cash?  YOU DON’T HAVE A DRUID!?!  Damn, some people are soo lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I have seen more than enough Clerics who nuked rather than the more dangerous healing also.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nuking has its place.  If s/he was over-nuking and constantly OOM, sure, call him/her on it, but if s/he only tossed 1 or 2 at the right time, all the more power to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So far as a Pet class goes, I have to wonder why Druids were given an addition in their Tracking skill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Because a skill level of 20 is well-nigh useless.  At 20 skill you can see farther than you can track.  Interestingly enough, Rangers have the opposite problem--At a skill of 200 you can track something across the zone, and your list will be so full it doesn't show the griffin coming up behind you.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want to see how powerful Druids are, go to Ak’Anon and see a high level Druid kiting three gnome guards at a time. Could a Cleric do this even with Journeyman Boots?&quot;<br />
<br />
Not to my knowledge.  Our DDs aren't mana-efficient enough.  I imagine we could to the med-kite thing if we had JBoots, but why would you want to?  You could get better experience fighting a constant stream of low blues in a 2- or 3-person group.<br />
<br />
Besides, why complain that Druids can do things that we can't?  By that argument Warriors are overpowered because they can melee and we cann't.  Enchanters get Clarity and we don't.  Mages/Necros/Enchanters/Shamans/Bards get pets and we don't.<br />
<br />
Look it it this way:  No ther class gets Superior Heal.  No other Class gets Complete Heal.  No other class gets our Stuns.  No other class gets Revives (Well, Paladins get Revive at 49, but who wants it at that level? Therefore, moot point).<br />
<br />
They can do things that we can't, but we can also do things that they can't.<br />
<br />
&quot;At this time, if you want to create a Cleric on a new server, you first create a Druid to make some money.

<br />
Hehe, I started a Druid to play when I feel like soloing (Yeah, I know, now I refuted all my other points  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif).  My cleric twinks my druid.  Clerics can make money fine.  Ever done the WK Bandit Sash quest?  Yeah, it's boring, but I can make 100pp in an hour for killing low low greens.  Not bad IMO.<br />

<br />
If your Cleric is 25th, I imagine your Druid must be lower?  If you ever need a Cleric partner, give me a tell.  I'd love to have a true Cleric as a partner so I could get some pointers.  Right now, all I have to go on is some varied opinions on this board, and my &quot;healer-style&quot; of play that I do with my Druid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">02-07-2000, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You want a gripe about some druids and unrest? Here it is:<br />
<br />
Druid goes into ghost room, kites the ghost, instantly becomes aggro to everything while fighting.<br />
<br />
Drags the whole basement to the zone, loots the ghost and leaves the zone to deal with the entire basement killing level 20's.<br />
<br />
That's what some druids have been doing on Sol Ro. It's NOT cool. I've spent time nuking the ghost off some level 20 barbarian since he never saw it coming, and myself and Warglory saved his life. We put that ghost down in about 30 seconds between us. I've spent alot of time yelling at druids like that. It gets you nowhere. They do it again. 25 mins later.<br />
<br />
I had groups in the TR since ghost was &quot;camped&quot; (Ya, right..), the resulting trains would come into TR and get stopped or we'd be forced to evac... No telling until we'd get surprised. Alot depended on my groups mana at the time. (I was 29 - 30 back then).. Since then, I've tried to keep ghost camped as much as I could to stop trains just as much for the xp. Everyone in the zone lived longer.<br />
<br />
Couple other clerics in the zone didn't appreciate that very much either.<br />
<br />
It wasn't all druids. I've seen alot of druids camp the room, keep the spawn under control. I've seen others train it out with total disregard for everyone's safety, letting the dot kill it while it runs around in the CY. These guys are on my never res list.. With good reason. Can't tell you how many revive's I've done over this junk, and how many yelling matches most of the higher levels in the zone had with these druids. It's not the class, it's the people behind them.   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
