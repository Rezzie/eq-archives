<br />
I've done it at 39 though, but sometimes you have to zone cause of running out of mana due to getting a lvl 37 spectre which just LOVES to resist those enstills and expel's.<br />
<br />
At 39, with around 170-180 wis you can do it pretty safely, just root and shoot.<br />
<br />
I'll be writing an updated guide on this when i get some spare time.<br />

<br />
Yes. Clerics CAN solo REDS past lvl 34. . .<br />
<br />
Not many other classes can say that.<br />
<br />
The outside spectre in feerot was either Yellow, Red, or DEEP red to me at lvl 34. But with a 180 wisdom and JourneyBoots I would Expel, Spook (resist) Spook again Stick, Expel, Expel, Spook (resist) spook again (resist again) SMACK Hit for 94 damage YOU ARE STUNNED... SMACK SMACK SMACK, RUN!<br />
<br />
... Spook, EXPEL, EXPEL, Run, Dismiss. <br />
<br />
Done! You have just killed a lvl 38 spectre at lvl 34. Woohoo!<br />
<br />
Guess what though... the xp for specs really doesnt seem all that great. At least not for me. And they dont drop boxes anymore it seems</div></div><hr />

I was walking along, trying to find the spectre cave when a spectre started me spinning. Scared the heck out of me...I ran like the girl I am to the zone and proceeded to drain every bit of mana I had killing it. <br />

At lvl 36 spent alot of time solo'ing in oasis with them. i found lower guk camping a hard hard spawn is the BEST exp for these levels. started camping AM at lvl 37 with 4 lvl 50's. 2 days later i'm now lvl 40 and one bubble into it.  spect's exp sux ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">niqlamor</div><div class="date">02-05-2001, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spectres are very interesting for they are very slow. With SoW and Jboots you can kite them around easily, stun+nuke being probably the best.<br />
<br />
If you want to root and nuke, I suggest root+panic the dead+nuke. IE when root breaks it's going away ... for the cost of Panic (50 mana) it's worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just stopped to get him once on the way back form LGuk to Rathe, so my info isnt very extensive.  The scythe he dropped did sell for 11pp though.<br />

<br />
None of the ones I've come across can see through IU.<br />
<br />
Solo'd a couple today at 41, now easy.  These things are so slow its funny, it really seems like they're snared when feared.<br />
