</FONT><HR>Ofbac's Moral Debate of the Week – <BR>Who is playing him/her today?	<P>Ok, this is a philosophical question to begin a discussion on a situation in EQ. Let's have a healthy discussion of the topic and avoid flames and anger and indignation. <P>The Topic:<BR>----------<BR>What is right/wrong with characters that get played by someone else?<P>The Situation:<BR>--------------<BR>You log in and see someone you have not seen in a few weeks/months and you strike up a conversation and find that they are not the same person you knew.<P>Could be an account that has become shared by various guild members.<P>Could have become an account given to a friend (may or may not have told anyone) or traded for a different character.<P>Could have been an account that was sold on eBay.<P>Regardless of how it happened, how do you feel deep down about talking to someone you know and finding it to be someone else? <P>The Compelling Moral/Philisophical questions:<BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>1) Is it ok for other friends/guildmates to also play a character when they need a certain class as has become common practice in many bigger guilds?  I'm not talking about Verant ELUA details, I'm asking about how do you morally feel about it.<BR>2) What do you really think about someone playing a character that they did not “earn” by  playing it through the levels themselves?<BR>3) Is it really different to trade characters with someone than it is to twink an alt or merely an extension of the same philosophy?<P>Disclaimer:<BR>-----------<BR>Please realize that there is no clear right or wrong in these situations and I am merely trying to sponsor a discussion on the moral and philosophical grounds of the situation. <BR>If your post will be a heated argument or a “just because” post then please don’t post. I want to hear well though through opinions on this, not rants and flames. <P>Have fun all.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I don't see anything ethically wrong with letting someone else play your character, with two caveats.<P>First, I think you need to be upfront with people about what's happening.  Tell friends and guildmates what to expect.  Maybe even post something on your server message board (although that may cause problems with Verant).  If I'm going into a dungeon, I want to know if that enchanter is being played by the same guy who got it to level 45, or some new guy who's still trying to figure out what that wacky "mesmerize" spell does.<P>Second, I think the "primary" player should be responsible for whatever is done with the character, even when controlled by someone else.  I've seen a number of situations where someone is criticized for antisocial behavior (KS'ing, ninja-looting, etc.) and responds with "oh, I've been letting my brother play with the character, that must have been him."  While I don't like to see someone punished for the actions of another, I think you have to reject this defense on pragmatic grounds, or else you've created an all-purpose loophole to get out of trouble.<P>Interesting sub-question:  Suppose the character has been loaned equipment by friends or guildmates.  If he's going to turn the character over to someone else, should he offer to return the equipment, even though the character will remain?  I think yes.  Even though the equipment was techinically given to the character, the main attraction of EQ is that you're dealing with other human beings.  If the human being is leaving the game, they should settle up their character's debts.<p>[This message has been edited by Aquinas (edited 10-19-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Someone I knew for over a year on Bertox is a char named "Lozan". We were pretty good friends and talked a lot.<P>He took a break for a while and then 'came back'. Imagine my shock to find Lozan was someone else entirely taken over the char.<P>I dont talk to this person at all anymore, its just weird. Its like a brain transplant.. the name, the face its all there but you talk to them and its not THEM. <P>I just dont like the feeling and decided I wouldnt bother even trying to see if this new person was nice or whatever.. <P>Its not against my morals but the situation unsettled me. Helped me decide if I ever 'quit' I will not ebay my char, nor let my friends take it over.<P><P>------------------<BR>- Badina <BR><A HREF="http://www.studio-erebus.com/eqhealers" TARGET=_blank>EQ Healers</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just to answer #3, and nip things in the bud.  I do belive that this is a completely separate issue from twinking and alts.  Twinks and alts are still the same people behind the keyboard, after all.<P>Other than that, interesting question.  I guess it depends on how strong of a bond you formed with that peron in the game.  <BR>Conveivably, if it is strong enough that you notice the difference, a guildie or the like, then presumably they would have let you know if they were selling out / sharing the account. If the didn't, how well did you know them really?<P>As for me personally, I don't generally remember names outside of a few RL friends.  I probably wouldn't notice the difference.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Do you out level your friend?<BR>    A. Never group with him again<BR>    B. Power level him when he gets back<BR>2. Make new friend dumb your old ones<BR>3. Play his char while he is gone - keep him up with the group<P>This happened in RL to me - char was enchanter not a cleric - I don't know how to play enchanter - so when The group got couple level higher - I parked the enchanter in Wrath mountains and killed HG until the Enchanter caught up - granted did nothing for his skills but at least he could group with us and his wining personality made up for his lack of skill.<P>Dorad Clericus<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have some thoughts on this, as I was having a hard time finding out what to do with my chars when I moved to the new server. I have seen many posts and heard many stories about people being hustled by players playing on a bought account. It seemed like it was happening all the time on my server. While it would have been easy to just sell my accounts and start over I did not. I wouldnt feel good if someone was tricked because they thought my old chars were still being played by me. I knew that there would always be someone I would have forgotten to tell what was going to happen. I deleted my main and to me, that was the solution. I am still glad I did not sell my accounts.<P>Soze<BR>Cleric of Brell <A HREF="http://www.khaeliq.dk" TARGET=_blank>http://www.khaeliq.dk</A>  - Clerics of EverQuest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I've recently cancelled my account, and so have direct experience of this.<P>About 4 months ago roughly, I became disillusioned with EQ as a game (details why don't really matter, but it was mainly the slow pace of the game coupled with the vast amounts of time required at lvls 50+). I kept my account active until I was absolutely sure that I wanted to quit.<P>During this time, I was one of 2 50+ clerics in my guild. My not playing was having a not-insubstantial affect on them, so I gave 2 of my closest friends in-guild my account password, and they would use my char for res' as needed.<P>Recently I became 100% sure that I had no urge to play again, and so offered them the chance to take over the account, by changing the credit card details to their own. But by now, my guild had grown some, and they have several 50+ clerics, so it wasn't so necessary to press Zak into service. And so at the end of this month, my account will expire.<P>I don't think it harms anyone in this case, because the entire guild knew what was going on, and so would know the guy behind the keyboard didn't necessarily have the 50+ lvls of clerical experience at keeping the party alive that I do. As long as you're up front about this, I don't see any problems.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Zakalwe Soulwarden<BR>50th lvl Halfling Cleric<BR>Old Continent, Povar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Badina:<P>Yes, Lozan "loaned" his account to one of his friends for a month or two while he was taking some burnout time off.<P>The "other" Lozan (or the Artist Formerly Known As Lozan as we called him) did just fine.  We took him places with us, so he could get the hang of what he was doing.  The real Loz is back now.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>My only quandaries with loaning accounts are:<P>1. Who is responsible for the actions of your friend/little brother/random bum off the street?  It's you.<P>2.  What if someone lets slip, and you log in tomorrow butt nekkid with a sore keister?  That's about my worst nightmare.<P>3.  This has happened to me before... what if they get you killed in such a way that you can't get your body?  (My situation was bad - I logged my husband's enchanter in, we were trying to help a friend who had lost his body in the lava, and only my husband had levitate.  I uh.. slipped off the edge, and in he went.)<P>So basically, I have no problem with people logging others in.  I have done it with my husband's account for various reasons before.  I just believe people should be responsible for what the "other" people are doing in their stead.<P>And I definitely agree that I damn well do NOT want the real enchanter's little sister playing him if we're somewhere that we need an enchanter.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Salina Grey<BR>Erudite Vicar of Pain, Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Generally, it's disconcerting when your "friend" turns out not to be your friend, but someone else entirely... and even someone who is unfriendly or rude!  This has happened... and it was an unpleasant experience.<P>I personally wouldn't trust a "bought" account and wouldn't want to hunt in a dangerous place with that person until they had proven their ability with the class.<P>However, as my guild's senior cleric, and a member of the guild's High Council (the guild is governed by a three-person council), I have given my account information to the two other Council members in addition to my real-life partner (who is also the guild's senior wizard).  I've known these folks for years (having played other online games with them) and trust them wholeheartedly.  They have saved the butts of countless guildmates using my account when I wasn't available for resses.  <P>It is an unspoken policy in our guild that whenever you are logged on to someone else's account, it is ANNOUNCED in guild-say.  That way, everyone in the guild know who's behind the steering wheel.  (This often leads to some good-natured teasing and joking around, especially if there's a gender-switch involved.)  In addition, accounts are logged on for a definite purpose... for resses, teleports, etc., the character is returned to exactly where you found him/her, and then immediately logged off.  When you are logged on to someone else's account, that account is not to be used for just hanging out or fooling around... you get the job done, and log out.  We have never stated these policies, we just follow them.  I think it's because we know it's a sort of "privacy violation" to be logged on to someone else's account, and the idea of trading off that person's reputation or using their advantages as your own would be unethical.  For instance, if someone were to log on to my account and start charging outrageous prices for resses... that would be disastrous.  It IS a written policy of the guild, however, that if a guild member wishes to sell their account, then all characters on that account would be immediately de-tagged.  This situation has never arisen in our guild, but the rule is there as a precaution.<P>Sharing of account information is not unethical as along as the behavior of the participants remains ethical.  Unfortunately, that's not always the case.  Having been a GM and Guide in other online games, I've seen the "little brother" syndrome all too often.  Personally, I don't let my little brother get anywhere NEAR my account!   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Maaggie Painstealer<BR>BAD - Brotherhood Against Darkness<BR>Xegony<BR>[Typo edited]<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Maaggie (edited 10-20-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>1) If the account in question is used for utility purposes (res, port, sow, clarity), I have no major problems with it. <P>2) If someone else has taken over the account who has never played the game or even just that particular class, I do have somewhat of a problem with it. It is technically not cheating, but I think it's cheezy. I guess I can't respect someone who gets everything handed to them on a silver platter without any effort.<P>3) It indeed is. First of all, you earned all the stuff yourself (we're talking about self-twinking, not being showered by items from guildmembers or friends) so it technically is your property. You spent hours after hours camping that piece, and I think that is an investment that crosses the boundaries of virtual and real life. You (the player) wasted 11 hours in front of the computer camping, not your character. Second, I think that raising a character to the level required to obtain high end items (50+ for example) gives you a priviledge to speed up the lower levels a little bit, providing you take the time to learn playing the class properly. But again, unless you are an idiot, you will most likely learn the most essential aspects of playing any class by the time you reach level 20. Of course, I'm talking about "reasonable" twinking. If it enchances your abilities to a certain degree but doesn't make you invulnerable to mobs of your level, then I think it is ok.<P>Just my $0.02<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have no trouble with people lending out their characters or giving them away, although like the posters above I like to be TOLD that it is a different person.<P>I also fully agree with the 'you are responsible for your reputation during loans' idea.<P>I was deeply miffed when I invited an enchanter into my group and found her to be a disaster.<P>I had grouped with her several times in the past, rezzed several times and exchanged friendly conversations with her, and trusted her to be competent.<P>She joined the group and seemed inexperienced (in her 40s) doing things like jumping around like a grasshopper to avoid mobs hitting her (??) and when I asked her if she wanted the pages I'd looted said 'What are pages'.  Alarm bells rang!!!  She admitted she wasn't the usual player.<P>She left the group after casting invisibility on the magician to maliciously kill his (fully buffed by me) pet, and I will not have that enchanter in my group EVER again.  She pretty much blew it with me by lending her account to a vindictive idiot - unless I can be sure its the 'original' enchanter then I'm not exposing any group of mine to her antics again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
