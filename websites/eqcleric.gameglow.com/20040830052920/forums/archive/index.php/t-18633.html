Plane of Time. Triune is raiding guild, but respects that people <br />
have  a real life. While we only require recruits to meet at least<br />
a 35% raiding percentage, we expect our members to raid at least 4<br />
nights a week baring unusual circumenstances.<br />

Please visit our website or contact our recruiters in game if you <br />
have any questions. Send a cross-server tell if you are thinking <br />
of switching servers. Morell-Thule has currently 3 time enabled <br />
guilds and one has moved onto GoD, so now is a good time to join.<br />
