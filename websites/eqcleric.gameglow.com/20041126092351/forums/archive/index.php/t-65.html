<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loramae</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...was a tell I got from a real life friend last night.  He, and some other mid 20's friends ventured into the jail and got royally smeared.  On their way to their corpses, my friend died again (naked!)<br />
<br />
Lucky for him, I was in Lesser Fay, so I stopped what I was doing, and sprinted (as fast as EQ characters can sprint) across Lfay into MM.  I already had the spell memmed and only hoped I could get there in time to catch his corpse before it poofed.<br />
<br />
I zone in, and the zone is empty except for my friends group which is at the zone.  His corpse was at the mouth of the tunntel supposedly, so I rush down towards the lake and hang a right, trash already clinging to me.  Guess I had about 6 or so trash mobs on me when I found the corpse, and I was guessing that it would poof any second, so I wasted no time.  Started casting, and yay for channeling, I got the spell off.  Kept all the trash on me till my friend could run to the zone, afterwhich I zoned too.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
On another note, I ressed one of my friends gruopmates whom reported she got ZERO exp back.  This hasn't happened in a long time, and I thought it was fixed. Has anyone else still noticed this happening from time to time?<br />
