I don't have a huge mana pool, so I could only cast the spell twice on a full bar :/ (I know I suck)<br />
<br />
To me, it seems like it could have some uses, but putting say 5 warriors in a group with 1 cleric is in a word, stupid?<br />
<br />
Could always pass around the crack rock in the old world though.<br />
<br />
Opinions? Also, on a related note, is there a mana cap? I've heard a few numbers, 3000, 3500, I believe I'm at about 2800 atm, but I know guildmates who have +600 mana, and I'm not sure if it's a waste or not.<br />

Was pretty useful when Wurms were pulled that do AE damage.  Had a party of 3 60 warriors, 60 SK and 60 paladin. Guess I am stupid. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">07-02-2001, 08:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or if you have 2 clerics and 4 big tanks in a group in VP.  One cleric casts word of redemption while the other spot heals and casts the faster group heals.  It's usefulness has improved now that we can duck and immediately interrupt spells.<br />
<br />
I used it last night in Velketor after a very long, drawn out fight when 3 tanks could've used a ch to top them off.  The shaman and mage in a mana robe winced down to no life while I med'ed up to cast it.  Lots of mana saved/gained.<br />
<br />
In ToV when/if there aren't a lot of clerics, it makes sense to clump a lot of the heavy tanks into the cleric groups.  Word of Redemption can be a life/mana saver there.<br />
<br />
Word of redemption is, like all spells, a situational spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">07-02-2001, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my, this spell kicks serious #$#$#@ in ToV (testing halls) and in Dozekar fights and Veeshan's peak.  I have a pretty big mana pool and I'm pretty sure I can get 3 of these off with very little to no medding (assuming no fizzle :P).  At the last Dozekar raid I was 50hp short of 4000hps (heh more then the ranger and rogue in my group I think).  So in the right situations this spell can do some serious healing, and I love it!<br />

<br />
This is my core healing spell in ToV and in Veeshan's Peak. My normal fighting group is three warriors, a shadowknight, and a ranger. Word of Redemption is perfect for such a group.<br />
