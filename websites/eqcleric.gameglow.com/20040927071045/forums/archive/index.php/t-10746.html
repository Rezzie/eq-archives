<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caprin</div><div class="date">07-31-2001, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, i'm a lvl 45 cleric and was wondering if anybody can give me some advice on a good place to go group and get good exp at my lvl.  I'm sick and tired of places like DL, SolB, Lguk, etc.  they can get so old and boring, especially DL.  When i ask higher lvls where they hunted at 45 i almost always get one of the listed places above.  So i guess i was wondering does anybody have any other suggestions, would appreciate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panteroo</div><div class="date">07-31-2001, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Burning Woods - good exp moderate chance of finding a group<br />
<br />
City of Mist - great exp but small chance of finding a group (BYOG)<br />
<br />
Trakanons Teeth - good exp but BYOG<br />
<br />
Skyshrine - mediocre exp but guardian armor (best pre-planar/pre-velious quest armor IMHO)<br />
<br />
Happ the ever-dead gnome in LFay - solo, but almost always permacamped<br />
<br />
Oasis of Marr - Spectre island do the 4 corner specters solo<br />
<br />
Kithacor forest - night time only, bring some friends<br />
<br />
Rathe Mountains - solo HG's (think they are still blue at 45) for nice cash... buy reagent gems at merchant when you have too much cp/sp/gp <br />
<br />
There are your non-typical answers<br />

Kill the church are or the libary for much xp and a few nice items(got an wieght reducing bag and a 6wis 6int secondary slot book.)  A bit out of the way but when you can get a yellow bubble an hour(in 45, I was) then you don't complain   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
It is definently a BYOG zone though<br />
<br />
Edit -- Might be nice if I mentioned the zone is in Field of Bone<br />

<br />
OMG we TOTALLY rocked this place and I got 2 yellow in 2 hours in 46...which was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Also the split from the MLer was 33 plat 155 gold each for the six of us, although the only thing good that dropped was a Runic Carver  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Anyway, the pops by the gates are like on a SUPER fast timer, all conned blue at 46.  Most were blue to a 50 as well. You can continually pull with no problems, and if you pull to the field you have zero chance of adds as no wanderers.<br />
<br />
Its not far from the DL/BW zone in, so your group can be fighting outside of Chardok 10 minutes after leaving the north wall of KC.<br />
<br />
Its great!<br />
