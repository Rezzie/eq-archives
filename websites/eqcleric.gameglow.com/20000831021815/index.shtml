Has anyone else noticed that the Login screen has been changed?  Before the most recent patch one could use Tab and Shift-Tab to switch between the Station Name and Station Password fields.

With Verant threatening to FURTHER nerf the Arms (and yea Pallies, you'll prob get it again too) it's time they make these usable once and for all.  Assuming Verant feels that the ability to heal 1,000 hit points a minute (5 200 point heals is the current rate) is too much, why not give both Clerics and Paladins our BETTER buffs and drastically reduce the RECAST time.  I'd far prefer to have them cast Heroism with say an 8 second cast time and a 45 second to 1 minute recast time.  This would make the arms usable for buffs, but not terribly attractive for battle heals.  Oh, give us Resolution if you must (although trust me lower level Clerics, once you have Heroism you won't WANT to cast Resolution), but giving us a mana free Valor is a joke unless we can heal with it.<br><br>Unless, of course, Verant could give us, oh, say Invis... =).<br><br>Post your comments <a href="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/003653.html">here</a>.</blockquote></p>

I received this beauty in my morning's e-mail:<blockquote>Considering that paladins deal with a worse buff while we  are tanking to be able to use this spell for healing purposes, it would make sense for paladins to be able to heal the same amount in the same time.</blockquote>Bet you also tell your girlfriend she'd do it if she loved you don't you? <br><br>I'll say it once again for the slow paladins in the room: I'm.......not.......your.......enemy.

Why else would a 45+ cleric (must be 45 to use the effect) USE his level 34 buff?  Doesn't Verant realize just how lame a Valor is as a buff to a cleric approaching 60?  Shoot, take it away anyway.

Let me explain in a bit of detail why I think 10 seconds is fair.<br><br>Previously, if I understood the specifics of the DW helm correctly, the helm did 100 points of damage every 6 seconds.  It had the same casting time as the pre-nerfed cleric arms, which were doing 200 points every 6 seconds.  Some weeks ago the casting time on the cleric arms was doubled to 12 seconds.  The DW helm WAS NOT adjusted at that time.<br><br>Do you paladins think that you should have the SAME RATE of healing as Clerics on the "click armor?"  You did before yesterday's change.  You didn't before OUR armor was nerfed.  Sorry, but I think the balance was restored.<br><br>I've never asked Verant for a nerf.  However, I don't think all nerfs are bad, or unfair.  I wasn't losing sleep before the DW helm nerf and I won't lose any sleep after.<br><br>Now quit bugging me.<br><br>Rayne<br><br></blockquote></p>

Yesterday's patch saw the long awaited change to the resurrection engine.  Below is the appropriate patch text:<blockquote>*Resurrection*<br><br>The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting. Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES. Previously, any<br>resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.</blockquote><br>This is indeed good news.<br><br>Now I've seen some kudo's being tossed my way over this issue and the kind words are very much appreciated.  However, instead of words may I suggest cold hard PLATINUM and ITEMS!  That's right folks, feel free to toss those unused dragon/god items my way.  Nothing says thank you like a Bladestopper and Dawnfire.  My twink NEEDS a Treeweave.  What's that you say? I'm an egotistical #$*(#)$?  It's a JOKE.  The above was just a joke.  Execpt the parts about the platinum and items......<br><br>Seriously, everyone who gave bump support is to be commended on this.  I only made a post.  It was the other 200+ comments added to it that got Verant's attention.  This change improves the game for everyone.<br><br>Rayne</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
The casting time for the Kunarkian Paladin helm was changed from 5 seconds to 10.  While I certainly understand how many players of the Paladin class would be upset I feel this change was warranted.  Clerics experienced this type of change previously when the casting time on Donal's Vambraces were changed from 6 seconds to 12.  All this patch did was bring the Deepwater Helm into line with Donal's Vambraces (by doubling the casting time).<br><br>FWIW, I STILL use the vambraces for battle healing; I'm just very careful about it.  Under certain circumstances (high AC tank, mob slowed, only one being fought) the vambraces CAN be used to heal even with a 12 second casting time.</blockquote></p>
