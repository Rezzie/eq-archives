<br />
Anyway, Last time I tried to go to LGuk (lvl 32), the frogs were KOS to me. Any suggestions, of how I should get there, etc?<br />
<br />
I have no clue about the 2 zones, how to get through, what groups I should try to get in, etc. etc. etc.<br />

My best advice would be get a friend that can invis/camo you and make sure you have stun/root &amp; gate memmed.  Print off a map of upper guk and study it a bit before you head in.  Try to figure out ahead of time where you are going and keep moving.  Should you get into trouble, stun, root and gate.  Do this a couple times and you should figure out how to get to the main zone area of lower guk fairly easily.  Once you are in lower guk, and fighting the dead stuff there, you might be able to raise your faction enough that you won't be KOS anymore by the upper guk frogs.<br />

Had a bad time for a first encounter- a guildmate took him to the &quot;ass-sup&quot; room, which I think was over Leo's head (L34, WAS 1 bub to 35  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif).  Leo died twice, sliced through pretty quickly.  <br />
<br />
The advice I had received said to solo at the zone, and try to get into a &quot;Bedroom loop&quot; group.  <br />
<br />
I am also curious if the greenies in Upper Guk will ever stop aggroing.  Leo killed just a few live frogs.  But it is enough that one of two frogs right near the zone to Lower Guk aggro. Running to Lower Guk is no biggie then, because Leo just zones.  But getting out will be another story. I hope that rooting and atoning will fix that.<br />

<br />
In a group I used to hunt in one of 3 places.<br />
<br />
The Wine room, which was a very scary (but enjoyable) experience.  The only way to a zone was underwater, but when we got through the tunnel and out the other side, the room was empty of any mobs or people.<br />
<br />
The Live side zone.  A very good place for Exp, we slaughtered hundreds of frogs here, and got trained a lot by people running to the zone with loads of frogs on their tails.  Not once did we get a warning of a train coming.<br />
<br />
The Dead-side zone.  Good for exp, easy place to find a place to zone.<br />
<br />
The answer to the initial question - do the greens stop aggroing? No.  They might aggro less, but they still aggro.<br />
<br />
I have been to Lower Guk a few times, and hated it.  That is one place I don't want to go back to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakalwe</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best advice I can give is to print out Questor of Norrath's maps of Guk, and study the route you will be taking to deadside lguk. If you make all the right turnings, it takes about 40 seconds each way. The live frogs are agro to me so I knew all about this when I started going to lguk, back in my low 30s.<br />
<br />
On the way down, nothing will agro til the scryer room in uguk. As long as you don't fall off the plank bridge over the water, you can get from there to deadside zone real fast, so if you do get in trouble just divine aura and leggit.<br />
<br />
Do the run down a few times, gating back out to the swamp. And then once you feel comfortable with the directions, run it the other way, coming out. From deadside back to the surface, the first few frogs are spread out, so I usually just rooted em and ran away, not bothering with atone. The only tricky bit coming out is the last bit by the crocs, but the frogs there are super low level so you shouldn't have any difficulties.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<br />
The last king camp I became threateningly and KOS now.  Not all dead frogs give you live faction so I've noticed, but I'm currently trying to get back to dubious.<br />
<br />
Just hit a dead frog once for the faction.  It does take quite a few kills for the faction to change for the better, yet only a handfull to get worse.  <br />

(The scryer room is about half way there, on that route.)<br />
<br />
The biggest key to success:  Stop, root, pass by and atone.<br />
<br />
1.  Stop.   Don't run!  You'll probably start picking up shamans, or other Tons, or who knows what.  One at a time is the key.<br />
<br />
2.  Root.  You *did* have root memorized, right?  I find Root works *very* nicely on these buggers.  If I'm close to the zone, I just root and skip the rest of these steps.<br />
<br />
3.  Pass by.  Out of aggro range.  If you forgot to memorize atone, here is your opportunity. Just stay away from anything else that'll poke you - they're much more aggressive when you're sitting...<br />
<br />
4.  Atone.  Never had this fail.  You can even stand next to another baddie, as long as he's not aggro too.  <br />
<br />
And you're off...  You can even do this for things like Corpse Recoveries to the spider room - root the spider in the hall, pass by, Atone, move on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juul</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting to deadside:  Fresh SoW, know the way (either by rote or with a handy map), have divine memmed, and run like a girl.  (I can say that, I am a girl!)<br />
Getting out:  You didn't bind there, did you?!?!<br />
<br />
Getting to liveside:  Fresh SoW, know the way (see above), have divine memed, run like a girl to deadside, zone in to reset aggro and heal up.  Now zone back out, take a deep breath, and /shout BANZAI!!!!! Cleric inc to liveside, move your butts! (a lot of people twink/exp at the liveside zone in uguk).  Now run like a girl again.<br />
Getting out:  Please tell me you didn't bind at liveside...<br />
<br />
Other tricks:  get an invis near the zoneline - invis does tend to fall at the worst possible times though, and some mobs can see through it.  If you choose this, make sure you have an SoW as well.  As far as learning the ways around uguk, make a human character and run them down.  You won't be KoS to live frogs, and can explore at your leisure, learning the routes.  I haven't done this in a while, but if they changed it, all you lose is about 30 minutes on a throw-away character.  You'll need an SoW to make it down to Guk, but that isn't hard to find.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harbron</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I be killed on sight by th' tougher frogs in Upper Guk, but I bin runnin' through since I bin yer level with little trouble.<br />
<br />
Here be me trick.<br />
<br />
Git yerself a map from EQ Atlas.  Ye'll be goin' t' Deadside by takin' th' right-hand route th' whole way.<br />
<br />
Once ye be enterin' an' makin' yer first right turn, ye'll be swimmin' through some water an' gittin' t' th' Heart Spiders where th' Giant Heart Spider be spawnin'.<br />
<br />
From there ye'll be runnin' through th' Froglok Scryer room.  Ye prob'ly bin 'ere b'fore gittin' th' ingot fer yer cleric quest legs.<br />
<br />
Ye'll be passin' through an unamed room an' takin' 'nother right fork 'till ye be comin' t' 'nother Heart Spider room.  There be plank ye be needin' t' cross.  Go right as ye be comin' off it.<br />
<br />
Past th' plank be th' only place ye ever be gittin' attacked.  Jus' keep Atone an' Root 'r Enstill mem'rized.  I jus' be Enstillin' th' few that be aggroin', movin' past 'em, then Atonin'.  Ye could jus' be runnin' from 'ere, but it be rude t' train th' people restin' up on this side 'f th' zone.<br />
<br />
I always be bindin' near th' fire pot.  It be jus' b'fore th' zone t' Lower Guk Dead Side.<br />
<br />
There be two more routes t' Lower Dead Side, but they both be unnerwater.  Nobody be usin' 'em.<br />
<br />
I bin goin' t' Lower Guk since I bin yer level an' th' places I bin so far be th' Assassin' / S'pplier Room, th' Bedroom, th' Spider Room, an' th' Magi / Hand Room.  Ye be on th' low end fer any rooms but th' Bedroom an' th' Spider Room, but with a good group ye'll be doin' fine in th' others.<br />
<br />
Th' best 'xperience bin in th' Spider Room when we bin pullin' ever'thin' in th' nearby area.<br />
<br />
Lower Guk dinnae be th' easiest place, but I bin havin' sev'ral real good days there an' a few real bad ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Harbron- you use the same way to get to Lower Guk that I do.  Nicely explained.  It's just that stupid frog right outside the lower guk zone. Sometimes there is one at the pits as well or just above the pits.  When Leo leaves, he will just have to use the stun/root/atone method.<br />
<br />
Anyway- Leo has been &quot;on ice&quot; for a while, sitting at the Upper Guk/Lower Guk zone.  When I have been to Lower Guk, there has been VERY few people in the zone, not the best scenario for a successful visit.<br />
<br />
Question about pulling to the zone (which has been suggested several times).  In some zones I have been in, people sitting at the zone don't appreciate this.  Course, this has been lower level areas where I think players seem less tolerant in general.  Also- does enough spawn at the bottom of that ramp to the left and right of the &quot;T&quot;, to support working this area?  One suggestion had said to go into the &quot;maze,&quot; while another had said the maze was hard to navigate.  Are the froggies at the bottom live or dead?  I thought when I observed someone hunting the zone that they pulled some live froggies.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the tips<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morrun</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulling stuff through Upper Guk to either Lower zone is not a good idea, in general.<br />
<br />
Not only do you greatly incovenience anyone who's hunting Shins etc. at the zone, but you run a risk of killing anyone who's just zoned out from a train Lower Guk.  I would be most upset if I'd escaped from Lower Guk with 50hp left, only to be promptly killed by a horde of angry level 25 Ton warriors.<br />
<br />
Use root/atone, and don't run if one hits you.  Alternatively, try a Pacify, and just walk right past  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Root em... dont bother with Atone, typically it wont work and there is a ton of their friends there anyway.<br />
<br />
Root anyone that aggros, go to zone, zone in, then back out, and bind there...<br />
<br />
I have recently aquired a Chrysoberyl Talisman, so I have no reason to ever go back to Lower Guk. *cheer*</div></div><hr />

Gaz knights will occasionally aggro, along with all tons. However, sometimes you can run by them quickly enough so that the aggro check doesn't happen when you are n aggro range (which I think by experience may be every 2 seconds or so).<br />
