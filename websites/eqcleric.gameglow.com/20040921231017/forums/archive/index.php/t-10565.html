<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">05-06-2001, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After regaining almost two levels lost in the Lake of Ill Omen, Neiff is a very happy cleric.<br />
<br />
High Keep - The first level for the goblins was great at lvl 23 except that there was a lot of downtime and sometimes someone died. Once my cleric had Greater Healing at lvl 24, this didn't happen (two warriars died in the group when our monk pulled 2 warrior goblins, a couple cabilists, and some guards while I was OOM, but I'd expected all of us to die).<br />
<br />
In a previous post, it was mentioned that a lower level party could get whiped out when pulling from the warrior room. From my experience, it doesn't work that way -<br />
what happens is the train goes straite to the guards who kill them off while all the characters head directly to the library where a guy with flaming fists does massive damage (300+) to the invaders.<br />
<br />
Warriors and raiders are definately the way to go during these levels, but mana is always an issue. <br />
<br />
Money isn't always that great in High Keep. Last night in six hours, Neiff made maybe six to eight plat. I liked S.Karana better for the fine steel that drops from the gnolls.<br />
<br />
When I can't get a group in the Keep, I head off to E.Karana and find myself a tank. I memorize endure poison, counteract poison, and we fight crag spiders. The spiders drop tons of silk and if you're not a tailor, there are enough tailors out there that will buy the silk swatches from you, at least on the server I'm playing on.<br />
<br />
Cure poison doesn't work very well against their poison which causes a lot of damage and persists. It was taking me three or four &quot;cure poisons&quot; before my tank was cured while I get it once with &quot;counteract poison&quot;.<br />
<br />
S.Karana is also good with the gnolls, just have a hard time finding pick-up groups there. It's also a long trip to the bank, and that fine steel weighs a lot. Still, both money and experience here is great. Sometimes it's all camped out though, which means there is nothing to pull. During one of these times, I went into splitpaw itself where I promptly died from a train. The inside was completly camped as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SolidSnke</div><div class="date">05-07-2001, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find the Gnolls to be great EXP (provided you can find a group) up to 35. Which then you can move to Velious and hunt on the bridge to Eastern Waste and get easy exp from the wolfies and giants.<br />
<br />

                Find a lot of bad guys! Because the bad guys want to give you all their loot - otherwise why would they keep coming back ;) Just remember to stand BEHIND the warrior!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twiggets</div><div class="date">05-07-2001, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hated killing Gnolls at the Spires in SK because they didn't spawn fast enough.  ust one stupid gnoll per spire and maybe the odd wandering one.  INSIDE paw was awesome.  My group stayed at the entrance and pulled and pulled.  That was around lvl 26 though.  I was getting as good exp as I get in Kunark though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shagga</div><div class="date">05-08-2001, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Neiff, nice to see you are enjoying yourself. I was one yellow bar from lvl 27 in the Frontier Mts today until I had to log off, and later the patch Gods struck. I'm single-mindedly pursuing hitting lvl 29 before I do any questing or making money, but I realize that I've abyssmally low wis for a cleric (a pathetic 119!!!) and I'm wondering what are the easy pieces to acquire for a cleric of my lvl, that hopefully does not involve extensive camping? Note that I'm merely a lvl 26 cleric in his first char, untwinked, with no high level friends. <br />
Is SolA an option? Is it easy to get a group there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">05-08-2001, 08:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My wisdom is at 119 as well. This weekend I'm going to do the (Vershia Tome?) quest, the one that starts in Quenos and requires killing Dyllin in High Pass. That adds +10 wis.<br />
<br />
The other things I've been looking at is a 50+ warrior helped me camp the alchamists room in Permafrost to get the (Mammoths Cloak?) which is more wisdom. Unfortunately, I lost the roll to a druid in the group.<br />
<br />
Some day I hope to hit SolA for the (Blackened Shield?) a +9 wis shield from the Fire Goblins.<br />
<br />
My current wisdom items is a cap from Unrest, a bracer and tunic from Kunark, and some splitpaw gloves. I purchased all of these for around 150pp. The gloves are easy enough to get hunting the splitpaw goblins in S.Karana but I didn't know that at the time I purchased them. Together, they add about +17 wisdom.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
A good mid 20s to mid 30s group (and I mean good, know how to play their class and work well together) could make their way through Permafrost or SolA I think. Some good wisdom items in both places from what I understand.<br />
<br />
My 50+ warrior friend when he helped me in Permafrost basically just got us in. There are a lot of goblins of all types (priests, wizards, etc) that con blue to me but they swarm like crazy when walking through. An enchanter is a must, some heavy hitters, and some tanks. Our party could have broken in on our own I think, but it would have taken a lot longer than with the 50+ clearing the way before us. The first section of the area was all con green at lvl 25, with the occasional high green which would aggro on us.<br />
<br />
I've heard that SolA is basically the same with the added danger of falling into lava. I think the goblins might be a bit tougher there just based on what I conned in Permafrost as being green/blue.<br />
<br />
As far as easy wisdom items and where to get them:<br />
  the tome quest (Quenos/High Pass) +10wis<br />
  Savants Cap (Unrest)<br />
  Tunic and Bracer from Lake of Ill Omen (Sarnak fort?)<br />
  Rings and such, I just buy, not sure where they come from.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shagga</div><div class="date">05-08-2001, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neiff, you know the Testament of Venear and the Charred Guardian Shield both go in the secondary slot right? You can't wield both at once (a pity... +19wis for a poor untwink like me's is mana from heaven) so if you do get both, hey, I'm willing to buy one of you.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of killin' Dyllin for the ToV too... <br />
<br />
I need that Paw of Opolla...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gabriel</div><div class="date">05-08-2001, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if I could use both the shield and testament -g-. Oh, well. I think I'd rather have the shield, but it may be awhile before I make it over to SolA with a group that can get it.<br />
<br />
I made some new friends in Permafrost who will help me with Dyllin so I'm going to do the Testament this weekend. I don't know what sort of wisdom we should have at what levels, but I figure since the breaks are every 25 points I'd do it this way:<br />
  50s = 200 wis<br />
  40s = 175 wis<br />
  30s = 150 wis<br />
  20s = 125 wis<br />
<br />
So my goal right now is to get 125 wisdom by 30th level. I can do that with the Testament or the shield, but the Testament is easier at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shagga</div><div class="date">05-10-2001, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made 125 wis, but i reckon ac is pretty important too. Recently acquired a Forest Loop and a Dusty Breastplate so my ac has increased tremendously, and I'm wondering whether I should give up my SBS for the Testament of Venear, or whether I should save up and hope someone sells me a Charred Guardian Shield.<br />
<br />
PS. Neiff I reckon you should come to the FM for the loot. The XP's not that fast, but the loot is pretty good.</div></div><hr />
