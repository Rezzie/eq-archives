</FONT><HR><B>Still I find it very inefficent. All the other preists and casters are out there with pets doing thier damage mana free, click nuke devices, quad kiting, mana efficent nukes, even more efficent DoT's.</B><BR> <BR>  Between rend robe and manarobe/epic and quad spells wizards can do okay solo but get them in a group and if it's always a mob in the camp they can get outnuked by shamans because of manaregen and then the shaman gets the pet on top.  Druid's rend robe doesn't come until Vex Thal, and DOTs are useless for groups so for groups are pretty useless, mages without pets...<BR> <BR><B>That's where we fall behind...lack of efficent damage dealing besides straight forward nukes.</B><BR> <BR>  And as I've said some classes ONLY get straight forward nukes for groups.  Clerics lack quad spells, but they do have enough AE they can do okay in or as a group.<BR> <BR><B>2. I think our undead nukes are outdated.<BR>Judgement = 325mana --> 925 dmg (2.85)<BR>Exile Undead = 250mana -->725dmg (2.9)<BR>Is that really that much of a better ratio? 0.05? I mean can we really be called the true undead slayer? LOL. not.</B><BR> <BR>  Truely pretty funny, but no different than the anti-summon line.  =(<BR> <BR><B>Wizards 4.0 on ice spear, 4.44 on bane spells (situational like undead)<P>Mages are second best nukers..they have a 3.37 ratio at 60.</B><BR> <BR>  Druid Moonfire is 3.59, on par with wizard's 60 fire and magic nukes.  Druid Ancient is a better ratio than Ice Spear.  Druid 60 nukes are on par with wizard 60 nukes for efficiency, their heals are on par with cleric 34 heals for efficiency.<BR> <BR><B>Verdict: Our undead nuke should be increased to 1000dmg for 310mana. 3.22 ratio. Why so close? It's not really. This is a situational nuke and it's less efficent then thier general nukes. It's more along the line of bane spells which is a FAR higher ratio, it's specific to undead. So a 3.22 ratio is rather conservative in comparision.</B><BR> <BR>  1200 for 300 like Icespear would actually make more sense.  Maybe make a 60 bane spell (the big bonus of banes are that they are irresistable, i.e. don't even need to be in melee range on dragons with dragon protection.)  As you say, it's situational.<BR>  <BR><B>3. I think our undead DoT's are too weak to even bother mem'ing. An undead DoT would mainly be used for solo'ing clerics because mobs in groups die too fast. And on raids...well we heal on raids.</B><BR> <BR>  The undead DOTs like the nukes need to be more efficient.  Only being useful soloing is the drawback of all DOTs except maybe funeral pyre.<BR> <BR><B>4. I think we need something to use against MR mobs. MY melee is ZIPO, NADA..I have no pet to speak of. And all I got is MR nukes and heals...alot of times in icewell and such before raids...I sit at full mana. I can do nothing with it..and there is not enough healing needed (if they upped dmg output or HP any further the zone would be even more barren then now, in addition to cleric nuke immune they are also unslowable)</B><BR> <BR>  I think Verant's view has been that everyone is a meleer, some just get more spells than others.  The weight of people saying HEY, I want to cast and NOT flail seems to get to them with making more things clicky instead of proc for casters.  But regardless even without duel weild you can still smack stuff around for okay damage with the right weapons and buffs.<BR> <BR><B>5. I think we need some sort of mana free damage, nothing spectacular, something that is less useful on groups or raids then it is when solo'ing. In our case all nukes are poor to use on raids, because we are expected to heal. But DoT's are definately less useful on raids.</B><BR> <BR>  Non pet classes need more mana.  Take a look at your mage and wizard ratios up above.  Now add on 40 to 60dps for the mage pet and the wizard and druid looks pretty gawdaweful as a damage dealer despite the better ratio nukes.  Wizard/druid/cleric need more mana, period.  VI sorta figured that out with BAotR and the wizard familiar (and screwed druids yet again) but it's nowhere close to enough.<BR> <BR><B>Speaking of which, I sure hope they have more dungeons like cazic in the near future. Quite frankly we have out grown dungeons such as velks, sebilis, karnors, acheva...ssra and cazic are the only real single group challange anymore. Ssra is slightly more difficult in some respects...and has crap for loot. Cazic is my idea of a near perfectly balanced high end skilled player exp/camp zone. Although at times I question just how good some of that loot is lol. But the same goes for the new smithed cultural armor...nice stuff is out for those who aren't in uber guilds these days.</B><BR> <BR>  CT and Ssra are two perfect exapmles of needing a cleric or shaman in the party.  =)  I could do without the shaman poison torrents though.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Bane spells require peridots though...I don't want to use peridots for each nuke I cast when soloing.<P>"Wizard/druid/cleric need more mana, period. VI sorta figured that out with BAotR and the wizard familiar (and screwed druids yet again)"<P>Did you forget protection of the glades/cabbage? How amout mask of the hunter? Or thier more efficent dot's and a couple of click dots?<P>"Just so's you know's, the shaman class is actually meant to be the most 'melee intensive' of the priest classes. The fact is referred to both in the instruction book and the Official Prima Guide to Everquest that game with my copy of Kunark (wuwu~) with the statement "They can also melee better than any other priest class". Further proof is in the actual offense cap, which is 25 more for shamans."<P>Yeah but clerics get plate, shaman get chain. Hint. Maybe shaman can MELEE better...but we are intended to have the best defense, highest AC. Shaman get a 70% slow spell...that is what allows them to melee. But sure if they want they can give shaman a 200 cap in weapons, and clerics 195 or 190. Or whatever. I'm more concerned with our defense. And frankly shamans solo quite well as it is...it's not like you will see clerics soloing yeldema or the entrance to ssra etc..they don't need a huge boots in solo power..maybe a little more to thier stright up nukes, or better yet..make stats mean more.<P>Did you know humans get an exp bonus and enchanters can enchant weapons and armor? That was in the manual too. But humans get NO EXP bonus, Halflings do. And enchanters just started to enchant ore for weapons recently in trade skills....after 3 years of the game being out.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20365" TARGET=_blank>Citra Dangermouse-60 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20357" TARGET=_blank>Venerable Pilsburry Dangermouse-60 CLR</A><BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>VEESHAN</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, my Akkirus greaves (eff: Word of Health) are very powerful.  I doubt there will be an upgrade.  Sure beats using bracer and boots to summon food and water.<P>Here is the way to think about these pants:<P>105 pt group heal every 12 seconds = 525 health per minute, and it's mana-free.<P>That is a regen that is three times better than the fungi tunic, with the added benefit that everyone gets to wear the chest armor of their choice.<P>In easy experience grinds like Velketors, provided pulling isn't out of control, you can get away with just running the greaves, with an occasional Remedy thrown in, thereby staying nearly full mana all the time.<P>Kind of boring being just a "regen emitter", but you can watch television or something while one finger hits the greaves over and over, hour after agonizing hour.

</FONT><HR>I always found it an interesting sequence of events that VI changed the effect on Bard Singing Steel armor to no longer summon food/water, because they felt that summoning food and water was not an appropriate effect for the level of difficulty, and then a few weeks later they released cleric armor that does the EXACT SAME THING (possibly 4 at a time instead of 1 at a time).

</FONT><HR>I've said it before, but I thnk my post got nuked.  One thing I've wanted to see for clerics (and shamen, prob), just as a pipe dream, was a second meditation-like skill: Fasting.  When you med, your skill level with Fasting would increase how much mana you get back.  If you were hungry, you would still get mana back from the Fasting skill (although the rest would be reduced as normal).  To train it up, you would have to go hungry.   It should take the same amount of time to go up as it does to go up in Meditation.<P>Not really a healing abilty, but there you go.  Hey, every one else gets cool skills, why not us, too?<P>If they improve the healing abilities of the other priest classes, I for one would like to see us get better heal spells at lower levels, and better group healing spells -- direct healing, healing-over-time, and some group cures.<P>How about a self-only rez spell that you don't have to use on your corpse?  Re-incarnation, or Prayer of the Lost Soul, or some such?  We would get them at the levels that Padadins get rez's, for the same XP restore (so finding your corpse is still worth while for XP). We are the masters or rez'ing, after all.<P>I'd really like to see clerics get some kind of utility spell.  Something useful when you aren't in combat -- and not just summoning food and drink -- would be great.  Lines of divination spells that let you find ground spawn drops or water (rivers, mud pits, etc) or the nearest zone line.  A spell to let you see through illusions (True Sight: includes illusion spells and secret doors).  Or a spell that makes holy water?  Enchant water, essentially, that becomes a ranged item that hurts undead, or maybe drunk to do some kind of cure.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Let me preface this by saying that I know little about bards, but upon review I think we might be able to achieve some of the major wants that the cleric class has by adding some bard like chants to the game.<P>All singing skill only<P>At lvl 30-Selo's Accelerando<BR>At lvl 39-Anthem De Armes<BR>At lvl 49-Largos Melodic Binding<BR>At lvl 54-Cassendra Chant<BR>At lvl 59-Crissons Pixie Strike<P>This would give us some help traveling, outdors, low level group haste and slow, group mana regen +2, and a low level mez.<P>All of these chants would be easily outclased by bards of the same level.  The group buffs would make us more desirable in exp groups, as an addition to shammys and enchanters in the high end.  I think there can be an arguement for the rollplaying of chanting clerics.  8 spell slots would limit us to using one or two of these in normal situations.  I can see no way that this would overpower our class.<P>I think twisting a couple of songs might make playing a cleric more interesting, and add a little more strategy.<P>I think it may solve some of the "I can't solo issues" as well, with out overpowering clerics at all.  At lvl 59 clerics would have group +25 strength, 10% haste, 25% slow, +2 mana regen, a 15 sec mez, and outdoor speed enhancement.   <P>Downsides -- Pissed bards, and we would be broken after every patch.  Other than that <BR>not much.<P>What do you think?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

That wouldn't exactly be a game altering effect in the sense that Celestial Elixir on SoL BP and CH on Donal's were.<P>We need Root and Stun on Bracer and Boots instead of Summon Groceries.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I liked the idea of creating holy water as a range item with a damage to undead component on it.  The could take away the old summon hammer spell line and replace it with a blessing of water spell line.  Would be nice to have a thrown weapon so clerics could do some damage to undead without using mana.<P>One thing I don't understand is our blind spell line.  I have a fear spell, and then I have this other spell that has a chance of fearing.  Does blind do anything else to a mob, like drop it's attack rating?  I have never found a good time to use this spell and wonder why I have it, unless as a utility to use in pvp situations.  Seems ridiculus to give us fear, and then the Blind line which only has a chance to fear and the Blinding Luminance spell which adds -5 to the attack rating.  This spell could be improved by removing the fear component and making it so the mob has a chance to hit for minimal damage each time.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>At the risk of being unpopular ..<P>At this point, I'd say other classes need boosts more than clerics do right now. Maybe stuff like a group CE could come with PoP but I dont think it is needed for *balancing*. Remember, this is about balancing guys, not 'druids and shaman are getting something so we should too'.<P>With aaxp, clerics are much less needed now for xp groups than they used to be that's very true, however I think this is a *good* thing for the game overall. During Kunark and Velious, clerics were essential for any dungeon group unless they wanted to halve their kill rate and possibly spend forever getting a res.<P>They still are essential for any <60 group in a dungeon imo, just not essential for 60+ groups fighting overconned blues in places like Velks any more.<P>I personally dont think clerics should be getting nukes that are within 10-20% of wizards, even undead nukes. Banes only work on a dozen mobs total and cost peridots per cast btw ..<P>Clerics, as the masters of healing, have a far bigger gap between themselves and others than wizards do between themselves and others. A wizard without a dmg focus item will be outnuked by many classes with one at most levels of the game. Imagine if a druid with a focus item could outheal a cleric   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>Clerics will be getting a ~20% reduction in mana costs, ~20% improvement in heals along with all the other priests through focus items. Yeah I know these are in heals clerics use rarely, since CH and CE arent helped, but, like I said, I think the gap needs to be narrowed rather than widened. CH and CE are still so much better it isnt funny.<P>Yeah it isnt as sexy as a 1000 pt nuke or group CE, but this is about balancing not improvements for the sake of it, isnt it? All priests and casters are getting big improvements in spell 'size' and efficiency. <P>Clerics will be getting their asked for 1k nukes through focus items now anyway   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>I have a high level warrior, wizard and cleric (lvl 60) for what it is worth, so I hope I can look at balancing reasonably impartially.<p>[This message has been edited by Elasto (edited 06-05-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Hrmm<P>I find some flaws in your logic.<P>You says that wizards without focus items can be outnuked by other classes that have focus items.

I think the only people we can outnuke is Enchanters and possibly Shamans.  Not sure about necros here since they aren't supposed to be true nuking classes.<P>CE isn't that much more powerful than the shaman HOT spell.  Other than the penalties associated with Torpor, there isn't that much difference in healing capability.<P>The only spell that we have that is truely unique and can't be matched is CH.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Dalur Stouthealer<BR>60th Dwarven High Priest<BR>Veeshan Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Let me be frank here, Elasto.<P>I'm willing to bet you PLed a cleric twink up. No shame in that. I know many people who have done the same. But I find these people ill equipped to discuss the plight of the cleric class with any authority. This is due in no small part to the fact that PLed twinks (indeed twinks in general) are sheltered from the problems primary clerics face. Twinks have a better quality of armor and generally don't have to seek for groups.<P>Our problem is we're healers and that's it. That was fine when you couldn't do much of anything without at least 1 dedicated healer. But nowadays we have level 60 shamen doing exp (haste + powerful slow), AA skills, disciplines and a whole host of new spells. The need for healing is seriously depreciated. In a fair paced exp group a cleric is NOT needed. A druid could heal almost as well as a cleric in many cases (despite what druids say I know what heals I cast vs what heals they have) and shamen can haste and slow to negate damage to such a point where even SH could keep up. Clerics are only needed when you're doing fast pace pulls (ie AE groups, multiple pulls, etc) or fighting mobs that are seriously underconned (ie Elite Guards in Ssra).<P>As for raids, I normally cast Group Aego, then BAoR a few times because some tank was OOR for Khura's and then comes the CH chain. That's it! To play a cleric in any raid all you need is to be able to make a CH macro hotkey and to be able to push said hotkey on demand. Clerics need 0 skill to be played in a raid situation. In essence, we're trained monkeys hitting a button.<P>So that leaves most primary clerics without the ability to 2-box out in the cold on many occasions. Groups no longer wait for clerics to get on, they just grab a shaman or druid and go. Many tanks now 2-box their own clerics since all they need is that CH hotkey.<P>So what do I want? I was talking to a druid about this issue (specifically over the rumor that NR will be turned into a druid CE) and they said the following statement which I think summed it all up nicely<BR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Well, clerics just weren't meant to be an offensive class<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>In other words, the cleric class is not a viable class on its own. We need at least one other player to be able to go and gain experience. We rely on others for travel (ports, invis), exp(damage dealing) and they depend on us to spam one spell over and over and over...<P>Why should I be forced to 2-box or roll up another class that CAN solo JUST to be able to enjoy EQ? Why is our role so narrow that you could remove all our spells but CH and res and not negatively impact the game?<P>I want to be able to solo! There, I have said it and now Abashi will smite me for it because EQ is a "grouping game". And yet no other class seems to agree with me. Druids especially since solo clericing would require us to gain some of their spells. They all seem content to let us be nothing more than CH/Res machines.<P>As to our undead nuke line? Our best undead nuke gets 2.9 efficiency as opposed to 4 or better for many wizards. More importantly, Verant is scared to death of specialty nukes. When was the last time you saw a 60 druid use Exile Summoned? When was the last time you saw a necro use Defoliate? The only zone I know of for clerics to solo reasonable blue undead would be in The Grey and as if they decided to screw clerics even more you must have EB, a spell clerics do not get, to go there. Lovely, isn't it? And even then it takes half of my 3500 mana pool to kill an undead snake. The best clerics DoT is now on the Hammer of the Sun. Something is seriously wrong here.<P>I want to be able to solo live critters. I do not want to be a wizard. I do not want to replace any other class in any role out there. I just want to be able to solo so I can enjoy the game when I can't find someone to tank for me. I want to have something else to do on raids besides hit the same ^#$@ button 60 times. Why is this so unreasonable to everyone else?<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Truely, Verant MUST NOT fix the priest classes by giving one class what the other has- ie improving the healing of druids. <P>I keep saying this, I know.  But I dont believe all the defensive spells have been thought of.  They should break out their old D&D games and look at other classic RPG's for inspiration.  Or just do a little brain storming. <P>I still say, a Curse spell- that affects the Random Number Generator would be great.  So for the duration of it- anything that affects the mob- and reads the RNG to determine an outcome- will have it affected in a manner that is good for the group.  <P>Ex- root might last longer, the mob misses more, hits for less- each of these actions ( as I understand it) reads the RNG to calculate an outcome.  Curse would impact this.<P>So what if it affects current encounters. EVERY change does.  And so VI comes up with new encounters later that take this into account.<P>I want an xp group to choose a cleric for something besides healing, and pity (well friendship too :P).<P>Shaiel- Heirophant<BR>Leonidas- Templar<BR>Anneli- Blackguard<BR>Niccola - plain ole monk</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>2 box a warrior myself, now I have a group for AA.<P>Without a group I log-off since soloing isn't an option at all, well unless you count the Grey and I don't have the means to get there safely without having to use invis potions.<P>We could use a self invis more than anything. Take away undead invis if they want since all the undead zones have living critters in them anyways. <P>Also, I'd like to see us get a group AC buff line of spells. When I do manage to get a group Aego really isn't necessary, but a group ac spell would speed up the buff/rebuff process.

</FONT><HR>I'm still mid-level, but you guys are depressing me. Not needed for groups at higher lvls? That just sounds insane. While I look forward to higher/raid encounters, the fun is in grouping/exploring with a group of friends. They do thier job, I do mine.<P>I don't want the ability to solo much. I would've made a druid if I did <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Clerics are there to keep people alive, so, I'd like to see things added inline with that.<P>An instant cast/very low mana heal....maybe make so you can only recast it every 20 or 30 min. A 911 heal.<P>A group AC buff would be so nice. Was in a Solb group last night and the druid could just stand up, one cast skin, sit and med.<P>A larger mana pool would be nice.<P>A Diety specific spell to bless weapons/Players would be fun. Giving weapons more damage or lower delay or a DD spell. Players would get an insane AC boost for a period of time or be unstunnable(is that a word?).. fun stuff like that. You'd only be able to cast it one time every EQ week. We get a mostly useless imbue gem spell..expand on that idea.(not the useless part <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">)<P>How about a sacrifice spell? You call upon Mithaniel Marr. Take my life and spare the Warrior? Not sure if that would have a use.<P>Anyway, I don't want the same utility spells that the other classes have. Just say no to SoW, Invis, Chloro, Pets, etc. I like to have to interact with others and have them interact with me. Also having to buy things I need like sow or invis from people that take the time to make them. These are the very things that make EQ fun.  <P>Come on Sony/Verant.

</FONT><HR>/nod Boanerges<P><BR>It is really quite simple. Most classes can solo and solo effectivly now. The hybrids Ranger/SK/Pallies do quite well now with the combination of spells/gear. Monks are soloing machines. Even warriors with some decent gear can solo well. Sadly, with a gear combination a, no mana, warrior actually has MORE utility than a cleric. They can invis, slow, snare, SoW, shrink, buff STR, etc. Excuse me while I go summon some food/water and hope the mobs eat and drink themselves to death for exp. Warriors midigate damage to such effect that not much healing is needed or they can throw or they can simply regen what little is lost back. Don't get me wrong, I am NOT crying for a nerf of these classes, I am happy for thier freedom but, the time of having a dedicated healer is fading into nothingness barring raids and a few zones. I am a pretty well geared cleric in terms of HP/AC/Mana/FT/spells with 30 AA and quite frankly can solo fairly effectively myself. It is only through a combination of gear/AA/spells/level that I can do this though and my hunting grounds are really restrictive. Maiden's Eye, The Grey and Howling Stones are my only real choices if I wish to solo, the latter two have risks of their own if it comes to CR due to lack of utility. <P>The six man group is being replaced by solo or two to three man teams in the name of efficency for exp/AA. Clerics are on the bottom end of that pick of the list because we are so lopsidedly defensive in nature in a game that requires less and less healing for exp. What the answer is, I do not know, the easy answer is more damage output even if restricted to undead. Long term, I cannot say the effects though.<p>[This message has been edited by Lith Ahntalon (edited 06-06-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am a fairly low level cleric being only 52. What I would like to see happen is that I could effectively gather some tailoring supplies.  While this is perhaps an inane request, it seems a sick joke that I can kill only a few crag spiders before another long meditation session being broken up by some little cat that I miss more than hit.  Now with Wu armor trivial, I am attempting to kill more very green mobs for really rare acryla, managing to kill two, as long as it is not the MR resistant grimling chief, before I have to sit and med almost as long as the respawn rate of the grimblings.  Like today, in about 4 hours of play I managed to kill about 50 grimblings, 2 at a time, and not a single piece of acryla or a point of experience.  Since I can not invest 6-8 hours of uninterrupted play, my going on raids is not much of an option to get fantastic armor.  Since I seldom accept donations for rezzing, like I believe is common for most clerics, buying invisibility potions to travel through Kael is economically infeasible.<P>With my killing low level mobs to poor, attempting experience giving mobs seems rather risky.  Yes I have camped the undead ruins in Dreadlands and with it taking 15 undead kills to get a single blue of aa experience and it taking around 8 minutes of med between each kill, gives me an impressive blue bubble every 2 hours or so, against undead.<P>Since every, or nearly every, priest class has the ability now to experience rez other players and most, if not all, classes able to solo better for experience, except for complete heals our class is no longer needed.  After all, even reparation gives back 20 percent and VL can make up the rest.<P>Think on it for a second.  What class is easiest to 2nd box?  Perhaps that was the intent of Verant to increase funds, each melee buying a second account for his pet cleric.  But as one that does not like to commit to a raid and have to leave midway through it, my cleric days seem numbered, and thus my EQ days.<P>It would be nice if Verant looked at our class and gave us something to look forward to.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You know I keep seeing people say that clerics need new spells, items, effects, etc. in order to function well in the experience portion of EverQuest today... what about alternate methods of increasing our desirability without adding new spells or items available to us...<P>Let me outline where I'm going here.  Two and a half years ago, no one would have thought of doing Sol B without a cleric in their KPC party.  Just wouldn't have been thought of.  Nowadays with items like Fungi and weapons like Centi SS / LS, Lamentation (and these are just the crappy ones), players regen health so fast and kill the mbos so quickly, you can get by with say, two druids, instead of a cleric, or a druid and a shaman.<P>Why not make a zone that's a little bit above our now beloved Accursed Temple of Cazic-Thule, something that absolutely without question requires a cleric to do.  And make the rewards exceptional.  Not necessarily in terms of loot, but in terms of experience.  What if we were to revamp Najena (arguably deserted on most any server) or Befallen (again, another deserted wasted zone).  These zones are CLOSE to city areas.  They are not being used though.  What if the mobs in just the entry way were hitting for 250... and what if you got a half a blue of experience just dropping an entryway mob... with mobs in the depth of the dungeons giving up to a full blue per kill.  You could increase the demand for a cleric while also giving good experience.<P>I think as time passed and employees left Verant, no one bothered to explain to the new exployees a simple fact that should be obvious:  In order to encourage someone to group, every member of the group needs to gain more experience than they could possibly gain solo.  That means if you want to entice a monk to come, if that monk makes a yellow per hour soloing, he needs to make a yellow every 30 to 40 minutes in this group.  Lets face it... for the majority of us at level 60, the loot we <B>really</B> want is only obtainable through a large & powerful guild.  Gaining AAXP points is a clear increase in power which helps along that goal...<P>Without adding a lot of new gear or abilities or spells, I just don't see a way for us as a clerics to be more desired in groups or to solo... and I'm not sure the answer is soloing... I think the answer should be to make more zones that <I>require</I> a cleric in your group.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>mananut is on the right path, but the problem is that there are zones where lvl 60s can solo and get good exp.  Even if good zones existed where groups get more exp (there are, btw) the casual player will log on and go solo, not go to a zone where they have to get a pickup group.  Reliability on groups for exp is gone for nearly all classes at level 60.  Clerics are definately left out of the lvl 60 solo club.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The last single target direct healing spell we get is divine light, and it sucks, here's what I propose.<P><BR>1) The cost and mana aren't so bad in that it scales with the spells that precede it, I would reccommend reducinging the casting time and increasing the range.  Remedy just doesn't cut it when the puller has taken a few spells or HT's, or even just a massive amount of melee.  Those are the two things that frustrate me the most about DL are it's cast time and range.<P>2) A new spell at 56<BR>   Relief<BR>   Heals 750 hps<BR>   Costs 275 mana<BR>   Takes 3.2 secs to cast<BR>   Has a range 1.2 times that of remedy<P>3) A new spell at 59<BR>   Holy Infusion<BR>   Heals 2100 hps<BR>   Costs 550 mana<BR>   Takes 4.5 secs to cast<BR>   Has the same range as Relief<P>4) Is it too much to ask that we get a group armor spell?  Not all of cleric types are at level 60 and *have* aegeolism to buff their group(s).<P>5) Rework the AA points we get, I'm taking a hint from the other posters here that the AA Abilities we get are relatively useless with only a few exceptions.  Some ideas have been suggested, but I'd like to add my own.  An AA focus skill that gives you a chance of comsuming half (or none if it requires just one) of the spell components required to cast the spell.<P>Those are the main point i'd like to make with healing a buffing, now onto things that can make a cleric busier (and more fun) in groups and the ability to solo.  If you try to find the difference between the three priest classes in a roleplay sense the are as follows:<P>Shamen are tribal and tied to spirits<BR>Druids are nomadic and tied to nature<BR>Clerics are civilized and tied to a god<P>The role of a traveling cleric with respect to others is to convert heretics and destroy infidels, in addition to making sure that those sympathetic to their cause, remain alive and thus sympathetic to their cause.  This, of course, brings me to the following suggestion:<P>Let us convert our enemies<P>Give us the ability to "charm" a creature of 2/3's our level or lower.  This would not work like a normal charm however.  The creature would behave like an enchanter pet, making it impossible to command, but it would fight by your side.  This would not last long however, a few minutes maximum.  Once the creature breaks the conversion, it will be completely and irrevocably aggroed on the cleric (It could be reconverted though).  This spell could also be cast upon any group member suffering from the effects of charm or mesmerize to bring them back to their senses.<P>Creatures who have good faction with your deity would not be affected, creatures with specifically bad faction would be difficult to convert.<P>I also like the previously mentioned idea of introducing chants at higher levels.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18235" TARGET=_blank>[54 Vicar]Ycarus Stoutfeather &lt;The Keepers&gt;:befallen</A><BR>Cleric of Bristlebane<BR>E'Ci Server<BR><B>FOR THE BORN!!</B></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
