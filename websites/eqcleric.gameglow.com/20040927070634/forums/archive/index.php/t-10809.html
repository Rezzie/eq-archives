So far I've killed a bunch of dwarves in icewell keep and given a set of dorf heads to the recruiter in Kael. I think I got a good Tormax adjustment killing Velk once, but I doubt it's enough for non-KOS. Right now I can travel freely through Kael if I avoid the Tormax-faction mobs; frost giants are indifferent but storm giants are still dubious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Captain Bevellos (at the bank) gives Tormax faction for coldain heads (can be turned in singly, not just 4 at once) and Icepaw kobold paws (4 at once). The paws also yield a nice mask with right-click Identify, a handy little utility spell.<br />
<br />
Coldain Royal Guards in Icewell give Tormax faction.<br />

<br />
Next time someone kills Dain or Velk, ask to tag along just for the faction hit, you will go scowling --&gt; amiable in one dain hit</div></div><hr />

<br />
Started dubious to Tormax, killed Velk, still dubious to Tormax.  Don't count on Velk for significant faction raises for him.<br />

I've killed a ton of dwarves for heads and handed them into Captain Bvellos.  I've gotten numerous faction hits from Coldain Royals.  I've handed in stacks and stacks of kobold paws...<br />
<br />
I'm now Amiable with Frost Giants.<br />
I'm now Warmly with Storm Giants.<br />
I'm still only dubious with Tormax.  *sigh*<br />
<br />
Still, that's not tooo bad given I just started all this a week ago, when I was still KOS to all three.<br />
<br />
It's tedious, but worth it I think.  Course, now that ToV armor drops have been nerfed, it will take longer for all the work to pay off but...I'm willing to be patient  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Plus I love not having to have invis to run through Kael anymore!  /cheer<br />

<br />
As an example...when I started killing dwarves for their little heads, I was apprehensive to them. Not that long after I became dubious, and staid dubious for a long time. However, when I came to threatening I went past it so fast I didn't even get to con a dwarf before I was scowling. (we were in icewell keep, killing hordes of them :-)</div></div><hr />
