<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morpheus</div><div class="date">11-26-1999, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that AC on cleric armor needs to be increased to be equivalent to the SK/Warrior/Paladin armor, or at the very least, more than Ranger and Rogue chain. I also agree that it needs to 'more interesting' to obtain. The items for the quests need to be put on NPCs that will at least gain you experience while you wait for them to spawn, not just a Stump Watch, or Cabin Watch, etc.<br />
One thing everyone seems to be missing, though, is that the cleric quests also give you no experience when you complete them. The experience you get should at least be equivalent to the experience you receive when you complete the crafted armor quests. IMO, this also needs to be on the list of demands.<br />

<br />
Most of us agree with you on the fact that experience needs to be given when the quests are completed, but since there are alternative ways to earn experience, we are focusing our main efforts on making the armor reasonably obtainable.  This thought follows the idea of tackling one problem at a time.  I hope you understand where I am coming from on this one.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, and I hope you'll be there to participate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morpheus</div><div class="date">11-28-1999, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, you think it is unreasonable to ask that we get experience for completing the quests? And you think it is reasonable the other quests like ours get experience for completing them and we don't?<br />
<br />
Whatever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morpheus</div><div class="date">12-01-1999, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think asking for the experience to be fixed in the quests is asking too much. In fact, it is the only thing that is really broken with the cleric quests. The argument that there are alternative means to gain experience does not hold water. There are very nice alternatives to the armor, too. If your argument that there are alternative ways to gain experience is valid, then why worry about the cleric armor? There are many alternatives to the cleric armor.<br />
<br />
I know I will take heat for this, but this is my opinion on the sit-in. I support the ideas of getting the AC increased and making it easier to obtain, but I don't the sit-in concept to accomplish our goals. Unlike the monk feign death nerf, which severely affects game play for an entire class of characters, the cleric armor quests have absolutely no effect on how you play a cleric. It really is just a wish list, similar to the cleric petition a while back, and we saw how effective that was. Also, there is a huge factor of the &quot;me, too&quot; syndrome. Monks did it, then I will too. Plus, it just gets other people severely pissed at us for something that really doesn't affect how we play a cleric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">12-01-1999, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but Morephus is absolutely correct.  The fact that experience is not granted is a bug, and honestly the only legitimate problem with the quests.  It should be fixed promptly.<br />
<br />
I agree 100% that the quests suck and the armor is sub-standard, and hopefully Verant will one day recognize this, but the fact is they may not agree with us.  There is no way Verant can justify not giving us experience when completing our quests when other classes get experience for theirs.<br />

While I think the sit-in may get Verants attention, I also am a firm beliver that &quot;the gods&quot; won't smile and change a thing.<br />
The least they could (and Should) do is <br />
FIX THAT BUG!!!!!!!<br />
