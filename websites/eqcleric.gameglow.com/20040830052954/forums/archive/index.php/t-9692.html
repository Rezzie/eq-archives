<br />
Way to go EQ, i fart in your general direction. (Wish I could use more profanity, but I promised Rayne I wouldn't)<br />
<br />
SPELLS SHOULD BE ONLY A PART OF A CLERICS LIFE! NOT ALL OF IT!!! <br />

PLEASE LET ME HIT SOMETHING SUCCESSFULLY WITH A MACE/CLUB/MORNING STAR/WHATEVER!</div></div><hr />

I am going to have to do the log thingie and see just how bad we are at hitting things. My partner is a shaman 2 levels lower than me and she was kicking that booty where i was lucky to hit 1 in 4 tries. I can do a max 19dmg with my Cold Iron Morningstar and I am lucky to get 10 when i actually do hit. she was hitting in the 20 with her 2h Midnight Mallet.<br />
<br />
ugg. But it is still fun to run in there and take a few swings. ehehhe</div></div><hr />

I have a halfling cleric with a bullsmasher and I do very well in dmg even at level 26.  I can sometimes max 14 dmg a hit and I hit like I'm double attacking, but I'm still not as good as the tanks. I am however as good as the shamans around for the most part. What makes this unfair is that the bullsmasher is only for small races so sorry to all you tall clerics out there.   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

but seriously... yeah I miss a lot, but there have been a few times where I had to step up and melee a cyclops or Hill Giant to death.  It is possible, hurts a lot but it is possible... beat on it untill you have enough mana for fear heal or WRATH that is he eh</div></div><hr />

I couldn't resist bumping the very last rant from 1999... Actually, it remains a valid rant.</div></div><hr />
