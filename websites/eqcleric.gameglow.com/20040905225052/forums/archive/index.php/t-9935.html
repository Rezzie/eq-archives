Wasn't the only change a SLIGHT increase in MOK?  We got Screwed with the healing BP's and don't say Divine Light was increased....it was just plain broken from the get-go with a 50/50 fizzle rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mendin</div><div class="date">04-17-2001, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MoK was not an improvement. MoK used to be a good spell. Then it was humongously nerfed to have the rough value of True North. (exaggeration, it does cancel damage shields). Then they made it a SLIGHT bit better from its nerfed state to be Slightly Better Than Humongously Nerfed Mark of Karn.<br />
<br />
The Class Balancing issues were not guaranteed to benefit every class. I guess Verant saw Clerics as too powerful.<br />
<br />
Also even if you use asterisks, it doesn't go well in the topic to have a word like that  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

But it is true that it doesn't look too good on our part.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaharz</div><div class="date">04-18-2001, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has long been said by the majority of the &quot;eq community&quot; classes are not balanced.  This is of course true, perfect balance will never be achieved, but many people mistake balance for total equality of ability.  For instance clerics can not even come close to soloing as well as necro, they are not equal in this ability.  But how many times do you see groups shouting &quot;Group needs a necro&quot; over and over?  I don't know any necros that have gone in a zone and ooced Xlvl Necrco LFG and gotten 10 tells as I have as cleric (of course sometimes I get complete silence too, but usually there is at least one group that needs me).<br />
<br />
Yes clerics have got the shaft on some things, especially MoK and especially recently.  Necros were nerfed like mad back in the day but many claim they are still &quot;overpowered&quot; and they probably are to a degree.  I do sometimes find it frustrating when I'll get the crap beating out of me by an IG, but my necromance friend will have me come up when he is soloing him so I can HP buff him and heal him so he will be able to constantly convert health to mana and have zero downtime on the 3 spawns outside perma, but at least I get exp and loot share.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Verrant has largely ignored the cleric class balance issues.  This is because clerics ability to find a group has not been hurt, groups still need them just as much as they always have so the cleric class is still balanced in Verrant's eyes.  Yes I find it insulting that the issues the cleric community brings forth are largely ignored and we are flames by other classes for whining, especially when it is something stupid like &quot;but you guys have resses.&quot;  Res is a wonderful thing.. but we all know it rarely gets you a group.  But I still like my cleric the best of all the classes I have played.  Most never even entertained me enough for me to continue to play them up to 20th level.  As long as I play this game I will always play my cleric.  I enjoy grouping, it is what draws me to this game.  If I just wanted to talk to myself I would play another game that actually has a dynamic story and quests that are more then running from place to place and camping a mob.  I have soloed a good bit, at times where I had trouble finding a group (like the low 20s) I hated it.  I was miserable soloing low blues to get through the levels to a better heal.  But as a cleric, I am rarely without a group, so I continue to play my cleric.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long rant, jump up and down and scream at me if you want, but remember, this is a game... if it pisses you off, and you aren't having fun, then it isn't worth your ten dollars a month.  If you are having fun, then why complain?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">By-Tor</div><div class="date">04-24-2001, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, me playing on a red server (RZ) since day one of EQ, VI has really screwed the cleric from my perspective.<br />
<br />
Clerics were great at defense and could even kill others in the beginning. But then VI nerfed the cleric's offense so it became harder to kill anyone.<br />
<br />
Then VI did other things to weaken clerics:<br />
1) cant fear people and then later not even their pets!<br />
2) root times drastically decreasted<br />
3) magic resists boosted on characters and items. Root, stun, blind were now useless<br />
<br />
Then the expansions came out.  Other classes could now do twice the damage they could before where as clerics could do maybe 10% more.  Equipment came out and not only did melee types get insane weapons (no penalty for melee damage in pvp) but their armor had even more resists.  Clerics didnt have the mana to even kill a warrior now but couldn't even root one to try to get away.  The cleric is the ONLY class that has such high defense (in a group) with so little offense.<br />
<br />
Without a group the cleric is dead, whether it be PvE or PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Castersrealm.com has a great breakdown of all the issues that were supposed to be addressed in the class balancing.  If you take a look at each class, most have from 0 - 3 issues that have actually been looked at (most have about 20 issues total).  Take a quick look at each class, and compare it to Cleric.  Looks to me like VI hasn't done much at all for any of the class balance issues.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kikflip</div><div class="date">05-03-2001, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, you are yelling about balancing issues when it comes to clerics. They are meant to be unbalanced. They are the ultimate support class and probably the most desired class in a group. At least you don't have to kill someone over 45th lvl to rezz someone... All in all everyone is unsatisfied with their class, and want to yell about it. All the classes are pretty balanced, it's just which one you choose to notice the most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">By-Tor</div><div class="date">05-04-2001, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL!  A necro complaining about balance....</div></div><hr />

Not really, no.<br />
I am very satisfied with my warrior and my shaman.</div></div><hr />
