<br />
Once you have performed a res on somebody, do you find they tend to hang onto your name and repeatedly call you when they need a res?  <br />
<br />
I was soloing a bit this weekend outside karnors and received a res request from this guy I had ressed a couple times in the past.  Somebody in their group had died in North K and they were at the wizard spires.  He asked if somebody came to fetch me and teleport me there and offered to pay if I would come to do a res.  Since I was soloing I agreed.  I met their druid in FV and gated to NK and did the res.  After I had done the res, I did a who all cleric 49 53 and found like 4 clerics that were not anon and were on that continent (not necessarily in that immediate area).  I then asked this guy if he had checked to see if any of the other clerics in the area could do the res.  He replied back, oh, never thought to ask any of them.  I just remember your name and did a who on you to see if you were around.  <br />
<br />
This happened 3 other times during this weekend with different people.<br />
<br />
Do you other res capable clerics find that people tend to hold onto your name and just give you personal tells asking for res if they see you online?<br />

However, it works in reverse also.  I needed to rez a friend in Rathe Mtns, I was in Frontier, did an OOC looking for a GG.  A guy that I had rezed earlier convinced his party Druid to GG me for free.  Very nice.  So, I am glad he remembered my name.<br />

I have made some friends in Overthere lately, though.  My group has been hunting there, and i generally offer to rez people who are shouting or auctioning for one as my time and mana allow between fights.  Everyone has been willing to bring me their corpse.  I hope they all remember me, since many of them offered their services in return if i am ever in need.<br />

<br />
If the person cannot get someone to get the corpse to me, I may (depending on the group) ask if the recipient is willing to consent someone to bring the corpse to me.<br />
<br />
If they do, I will res.  Whatever happens, I will not risk the group by leaving them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bout a week 'go, I bin gittin' asked if'n I be able t' run from North Freeport t' Nektulos an' Resuscitate someone.  I be sayin' sure, an' makin' th' trip.  Jus' after I be bringin' 'im back t' life an' healin' 'im, somebody be trainin' three guards t' th' zone where we be.  I bin pumpin' two more heals int' 'im t' be keepin' 'im 'live 'til 'e kin be zonin'.  Then th' guards be turnin' on me t' be 'xpressin' their 'ppreciation fer me presence.  Fortunately, they mos'ly bin th' weaker guards.<br />
<br />
I zone back t' East Commons an' be tossin' a couple 'eals on 'im.  I be r'ceivin' a &quot;Thank ye&quot; an' nothin' else.  Well, 'e dinnae be promisin' anythin' t' b'gin with, so I jus' bin makin' a note on me rez list that 'e be cheap, an' goin' on me way.<br />
<br />
Two days 'go I bin gittin' a tell from 'im 'gain.  I be checkin' me rez list an' seein' that 'e dinnae be one t' donate.  Then I be findin' out from 'im that 'e be wantin' me t' go from West Freeport t' th' North K'rana spires.  I bin tellin' 'im that it be up t' 'im t' be makin' th' travel 'rrangements, an' it be costin' 'im 50pp.  He be sayin' that be no problem.<br />
<br />
He bin gittin' a druid t' be tel'portin' us there, then I be runnin' on 'head t' 'is corpse an' Resuscitatin' 'im.  Jus' after I be bringin' 'im back, an' b'fore 'e be payin' me, 'e be goin' linkdead.  Now sometimes this kin be happenin', so I be stickin' 'roun' fer a little.  No sign 'f 'im.  I be goin' on me way but checkin' ever' so often t' see if'n 'e be back.  There be no sign 'f 'im fer th' res' 'f th' evenin'.<br />
<br />
Th' nex' day I bin on me way t' Timorous Deep when I be stumblin' over th' same lad in th' Oasis.  I be askin' 'im fer th' 50pp 'e be owin' me an' 'e be tellin' me 'e dinnae be 'avin' it an' kin I be waitin'.  I be gittin' in touch with one 'f me friends in 'is guild an' 'xplainin' what be goin' on t' 'im an' 'e b'gins talkin' t' th' lad too.<br />
<br />
Well, th' lad be takin' ferever t' be gittin' th' money, an' I be tellin' 'im that 'e be makin' me miss th' barge t' Timorous.  Th' lad then be offerin' me a Bracelet 'f Beetlekind 'nstead 'f 50pp.  I be tellin' 'im th' Bracelet be worth a lot less'n th' money 'e be owin' me.<br />
<br />
After I be missin' th' secon' barge, I be tellin' 'im that it be lookin' like 'e be stallin' t' be keepin' from payin' me.  Then 'e bin callin' me a greedy little Dwarf an' bin tellin' me I bin ungrateful fer th' gifts that me god bin givin' me.  After a heated 'xchange 'f words, 'e be tellin' me that I kin jus' be waitin' fer me payment.<br />

Such actions are a real time saver for you over the long run.  You need never Heal, Cure, or Resuscitate him ever again.  With 17 more levels to go, and 11 or so being hell levels, that is a great bonus for you.  On the other hand, the amount of time that he has wasted by missing even one Resuscitate or Resurrection will be huge for him.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Look at the long term, he isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But here's a sad story .... I was in Hate, we had just broken in, had a pretty tough fight that included two golems.  I get a tell from this guy I know who needs a res in Cazic Thule.  I say, &quot;I'm sorry, but I'm in Hate at the moment and the raid just started.&quot;  He says, &quot;But you could die (hint) and run over to CT to res me, it wouldn't take long just tell them you're not ready to get ressed back yet until you res me.&quot;  I say, &quot;I'm not going to die on purpose and endanger my group by doing that and then making them wait to res me back.&quot;  He says, &quot;But you could die during the fight if it goes bad, right? hehe&quot;.  I say, &quot;Sorry, its not going to happen, good luck on getting a res though.&quot;  He says, &quot;But if you die, you'll come res me right?&quot;<br />

After leaving a group, I ended up ressing a recently deceased full group and in return they gave me a cinch cord.  I was happy.<br />
<br />
I've seen so many rude clerics that I wish to make a better name for the class.  I guess I just have patience for the 5 tells to res at one time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suriya</div><div class="date">05-30-2000, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this happens constantly hehehe.  But I don't mind, as long as they are reasonable about their requests.<br />
<br />
I want them to drag the body to me and also provide a transport to near the body...ie if the corpse is in SK, i want a ride to NK and I want that corpse dragged to the bridge.<br />
<br />
I don't take $$ (well VERY rarely) and I rarely say no, UNLESS I'm busy and committed in a group situation, then its &quot;sorry, no can do&quot;.  If they DARE to give me a guilt trip, then they can just be on my no res list.  I have as much right to hunt and enjoy myself as they do, I'm not obligated to leave my group and my hunt at the time to save them time and xp.<br />
<br />
For example, I was in the crypt in Sebilis the other day, and had several /tells requesting resses.  Most of them were just fine with accepting that I was busy, but one nagged and nagged, saying I should either gate out and res them (I'm bound in Trak's Teeth and they died in Paw...um ya) or die and come res them, then have the other cleric in my group res me back there.  So basically make my entire group wait while I get a teleport to NK from Trak's Teeth, run to the body, res, then they should res me back and wait on my mana?  Um no. =D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been trying to get the enchanter in my normal group to 49 ... so she and I have been grouped with our 48 bard a lot to try to level her through 47/48.  We found a great spot in the sw corner of the plaza surrounding Karnor's castle -- been using fear/chain tactics then nuking; with double clarity we don't have long down times and can generally get a good bubble or two of experience for her in a few hours.  I dislike being anon, so am constantly barraged with tells for resses there.  I probably do a half dozen or more to total strangers every night we're there (thankfully not too often since normally we can get our full group together).<br />
<br />
Some interesting observations:<br />
<br />
Most of the res requests are from drewds, with necros being right behind them in line.  Only ressed one warrior, and a couple of other casters.<br />
<br />
Very darn few of them even offer a sow or anything in return.  Last night, every single res I did the person just said &quot;thanks&quot; and left...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, but a SoW or small donation would have been nice -- granted, I have double clarity going so it's only 2 minutes down time -- but that's a kill or two!  And I won't even talk about all the ones you res who expect you to then run two zones away because you helped them before...<br />
<br />
It really seems that a lot of folks treat ressing as a &quot;right&quot; rather than a privelage.  And it's frustrating when you tell someone that you'd be glad to help, just drag the corpse to you... and they /ooc the zone about what a jerk you are because you won't help them.<br />
<br />
It's getting so bad that I am starting to use /anon or /roleplay some nights just to cut down on the headaches.  But I'm proud of my cleric, just tired of the idiots  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
He forgot to get a bind in Freeport (how many of us have forgotten to bind somewhere?).<br />
<br />
He was afraid that he was going to lose his stuff by the time he got there.<br />
<br />
I ressed him, as I was not far from his body.<br />
<br />
He was very grateful and was offering to pay.  Since he needed the res quite quickly, he was willing to pay a lot for his level (I know he was probably a twink).  I refused payment, because it wasn't an inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Because of the time I spent helping this person, I missed the boat to Butcherblock, and gave up waiting for the boat to get to Kedge (I was only going to be on for a couple of hours).<br />
<br />
Ah well, these things happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was in a camp in FV doing Forest Giants when I get a tell from a guy that his friend has died and needs a res. I ask him to drag the body to me and I'll do the res. Several minutes pass and I'm sitting there, intentionally refraining from nuking, and still no corpse. So I send the guy a tell asking him for his progress. He replies &quot;OH! I got a 49 res for him. Thanks.&quot; GRRRRR<br />

<br />
Tell you all a nice res story tho. Last Monday I was in the hate raid that wasn't to begin for an hour, so I was tooling around Freeport buffing the younger characters and practicing my smithing (just for fun) and I get a tell from a 50 Necro who is fighting the Dino in OOT. He needs a res and is wondering if I might be able to do it.<br />
<br />
Well, since I had the time to kill, I said alright. I hopped on the boat, got off at Sister Island and took one of those little boats to the Dino Island. (I like it when it says &quot;You have the Helm Captain!&quot;)<br />
<br />
I get there, res him, and he paid me with a Skull Shaped Barbute and a ring that a vendor bought for 152 plat. It's the most I ever got.<br />
<br />
Not to mention he dumped all his mana on me before I ressed him.<br />
<br />
So maybe not all Necro kewl doods are so bad, hehe.<br />

I'm making an effort to destroy that vision by giving res after res.<br />
<br />
I was in Lower Guk and spent an hour or so as a mobile medic.  Trains upon trains were constant and I ended up ressing over 10 people, some more than once.  I took no money (except the one person who forced me :| )<br />
I was trying to make a difference in their play time. To make it more enjoyable, less exp loss and downtime.  I hate the exp loss factor that Verant has implemented and will res accordingly.<br />

As I've always said to people who ask me what they could do to repay me, I simply tell them &quot;If ye wish to repay me, then help another when they are in need, as I've helped ye&quot;.<br />
<br />
If yer not one of my friends, in my guild, an ally of my guild, or in my group, don't expect me to res you.  You can request it of course, but don't EXPECT (as in feel that getting a res is a RIGHT, as opposed to a PRIVELEGE) me to res you, no matter the circumstance.  I don't mind people asking me for a res.  If I'm not grouped and walking through a zone when someone is in need, I'll res em without thought.  If I'm grouped and someone in zone needs a res, and is willing to bring the body to me, I'll res them when I have the mana (hey you may have to wait an hour while the insane monk we call Qwai feels like taking a break from pulling, but you will get your res if yer willing to wait).<br />
<br />
Anyone that has been rude to me or my friends in the past, would best be served looking elsewhere for a res.  I treat peeps the way they treat me, if I'm treated with respect and kindness you can bet I will respond accordingly.  =)<br />

If the amount is right, I'll make the trip. I've crossed multiple zones and most of South Karana to do a res when money is offered. I do res's for free too, don't get the wrong idea. It all depends on how I feel or what I am doing. <br />
<br />
I've been paid as much as 150pp for a revive and as low as a &quot;Thank you, you're my best friend forever and ever.&quot;(which isn't so bad) For me it's all about time. If I can help someone out and it's not gonna impede on my play time then great, otherwise try someone else. I'll do a res anywhere as long as it's not too nutty and money helps me to do nuttier res requests but not always. I've done res's traveling from one end of Atonica to another, of course transportation was provided. I won't go out of my way if it endangers myself or my group unless it's for a very good friend or a member of my group. <br />

<br />
On on ehand they help you meet a lot of people and can lead to establishing a reputation for you that helps you get into good groups or raids.<br />
<br />
I've never asked for a donation for a res. When they are offered, I take them or I refuse depending upon the situation.  Level 5 wants to save himself som time, Sure, I'll take his money.  Level 20 killed in paw and forgot he is bound in steamfont?  I'll turn down payment as long as I was close by to do the res.<br />
<br />
When is res a problem?  When Im in a group in tight spot and I get 10 tells in 10 minutes for resses and I honestly cannot spare the mana. Especially if it's a time when there is no bard or chanter around for clarity.  <br />
<br />
One thing I won't do is ask my groups (pickup or my regular crew) to do is to sit on their butts while I med up after a res or two.  <br />
<br />
And I do something that I've been told that no other cleirc ever does.  I split.<br />
<br />
When I res someone, if I'm in a group (which suffers a loss of efficency due to my 700 mana cast) and I get a donation, I split it.  It is their time too.<br />
<br />
One time I got a truly pathetic plea from a pair that died in Guk and were bound in Dagnor's.  I agreed to res and went and did so.  They donated a total of 300 plat between them.  When I go back to my group I did a /split 300 0 0 0 and everyone got 50 plat.<br />

They were floored nd asked if I had made a mistake and meant to split my coppers.  LOL<br />
<br />
I see it this way.  They could not pull as much or as safely as when I was there.  So they deserve it as much as I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squamos</div><div class="date">05-31-2000, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Ofbac, I split too if I am in a group and I used their time.  I am usually pretty flexible with rezes when I am solo (and I solo quite a bit), but very stingy when grouped.  If grouped, I tell the requester that I have to get clearance from the group and give the requestor a rough estimate of the total down time in person-minutes that the rez will take, then ask for an offer to present to the group.  If the group accepts, I do the rez and split the charge.  <br />
<br />
The key is to estimate the down-time correctly.  You have to account for the travel, casting, healing, buffing and <br />
medding time and then multiply by the number<br />
of people in the group.  The total is <br />
usually prohibitively large.  However, sometimes the group will be swayed by a particularly sad story and someone can get a rez cheap or free.  You can also reduce the cost by dragging the body to me and refusing the post-rez heals and buffs. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, while I almost always get an initial surprised response, once I explain the calculation and say that it is really up to the group, I have never received a negative or unfriendly response.  Some day I will.<br />
<br />
To answer the original question, I definitely end up on people's request list if I rez them.  Happens all the time.  Heck, I even had someone ask me if I minded if he put me on his friends list just because I helped him out in a fight (level 41 too - how can you not have a full friends list by then?)<br />
<br />
Lastly, to balance all the cheapskates, here is an opposite example.  Was in Dreadlands this morning at the FV entrance just sitting around when someone asks me if I can rez him and his friend if they bring the bodies to me.  This is after he cast Clarity on me without my asking.  I say &quot;sure&quot; and rez the 2 bodies after about 5 minutes of waiting.  Then players both ask if I would take a donation.  I let them both know that it was free, but I never refuse money if they want to donate (those symbols add up).  They end up giving me 150 plat.  Felt a bit embarrassed about it given the amount of work I did.  Then they proceed to thank me over and over, kissing the ground, etc.  <br />
<br />
Makes up for the jerk who begged me to come to WK from Lesser Faydark only to have his corpse be too old to rez.  His &quot;donation&quot; for my time was 10 gold - lol.  This was a level 40 wizard.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reviver</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I get an average of 1 or 2 res calls per hour of game play. Roughly 25% of these are from people I have ressed before, 25% are referals from people I have ressed before, that's only a conservative estimate. I usually am able to res people 80% of the time, where you are doesn't matter, if I say I'll come, I'll find a way to get to you. Only when I go on the rare raid or rare camp will I be unable to respond to requests. <br />
<br />
Haven't accepted much donations unless I was in dire need of cash (a few coppers in the bank), but lately I've been harassed by some people whom I've ressed loads of times to accept donations. The most I ever got to date was either 400pp or 200pp and a serpentine bracer. Both were from Necros who threatened to umm ... turn lose their pet on me.<br />
<br />
I find that for a little of my time, I can help another person save a considerable amount of time which counts for a lot in EQ  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
