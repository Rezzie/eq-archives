<br />
I'm looking for a place to solo at level 53. <br />
<br />
I tried the Burning Woods, but there were far too many greens now, and Gullerback always seemed to cause me troubles! No way I can solo a wurm either. Too many hps.<br />
<br />
I also tried the Spectral Keepers near Sebilis, but there seemed to be too many of them together. I couldn't seem to pull one at a time.<br />
<br />
I'd love to just find a little camp somewhere with some nice yummy blues that I can solo reliably. I'd prefer undead, but I'm not wedded to the idea. <br />
<br />
I have heard that the City of Mist is good, but I wonder if anyone has soloed there.<br />
<br />
Any ideas appreciated!<br />

<br />
I just turned 53 myself. As for soloing, from 51 to 52, there are suddenly a lot less blues, hop to 53, and yes even more of the &quot;yummy&quot; blues from places like Dreadlands and Burningwoods, just disappear.<br />
<br />
I noticed in Emerald jungle there is still quite a few blues to a level 53. Though there are still quite too many greens. There are still Trakaraptors, Raging Tigers, Raging Gorilas, and Erollisi bloodthorns, or something like that that still con blue. Other then that, Skyfire has a ton of blues, but most mobs there seem to have a lot of hp. You could try the good old root and nuke in there, though you might have to toss in some enstills so you can med back enough mana for a kill. Not sure if it would be worth it. <br />
<br />
Wish i could help you more. I'll keep my eye out for any other spots.<br />

There is 4 rooms, each with one keeper. You can easily take these guys out one at a time. By the time you solo the 4th one and med up, the 1st one should be popping again. Of the 6 that I killed, all were blue. The only thing of course is the boredom of soloing. I was actually headed to seb, but didn't realized until i was in Trak that I had left my key in the bank. Duh! Anyways... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">08-29-2000, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can avoid the constant trains within Karnors, the drolvarg sentries are farily easy to solo.  Even before you get Reconning, you can take out the sentries.  Just pull them to close to the zone and root/nuke them till they drop.  Sit down near the zone and med up.  I do this a lot and quite often I get a drive by clarity from enchanters.  At 53, the ragers that spawn at the entrance to the caste in the DL are mainly blue.  Most of hte petrified cockatrices in DL will be blue.  Some of the widow spiders will be blue.  Some of the big ape things will be blue.  Skyfire is not soloable by a cleric.  I tried at 54 and at 55 on the easiest mobs in the job and was not able to finish them.  Even with hitting for full damage I ran out of mana before I finished them - this is with 200 wis and no +mana items at the time.<br />
<br />
The spectral keepers near the EJ zone will be mixing high greens with blues.  They are a bit tougher than specs were as there are a variety of diffent types.  Most all of them have some sort of spell nuke.  The spectral champions are the easiest to solo in my opinion as they have no spells.  They do pack quite the melee damage though, so be sure to stun them if they break your root.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veloran</div><div class="date">08-29-2000, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Dalur, when you tried to solo in Sky, are you jsut rooting then nuking until you're Oom or until the mob is dead? What I do for high HP mobs, say like a forest giant, that I normally don't have enough mana for a straight out burn contest is the usual root and nuke, but occasionaly, I'll root and med through the root and when root breaks, repeat, or sometimes toss an ensnare to let me med even more. This way, yes the fight is longer, but I stretch out my mana supply, so to speak. Just a thought...<br />

I hunted at there from 51 to 54. But you need to know the pathing, where to camp and pull. Goo house is one of best spot to camp.<br />
BW is not bad too. Camp at near skyfire zone. Use sense undead to find mobs. Many are still blue to 55 at there. But most green at 56.<br />
BTW, you can pull blue spectral keepers solo at 53 even they stay together. Just need stay away and cast.</div></div><hr />

The 2 instances I tried to solo in skyfire -<br />
Both times I pulled a Bottomless gnawer - level 39 to 43 according to allakhazam's web site.<br />
<br />
I pulled near the BW zone and rooted, and nuked, then sat and medded till root broke, rooted again, nuked and repeated.  By the time I casted my last nuke and was OOM, the gnawer still had about 2 to 3 nukes worth of health left.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tommara</div><div class="date">08-30-2000, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've soloed the spectral keepers in Trak near the EJ zone quite a bit.  At 51, all were exp, even the greens.  Now at 52 (thanks to the keepers  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif), some of the greens no longer give exp.  I've never pulled more than one keeper, but I use Sense the Dead to target them, to ensure that I've selected the closest one, and not one that will run into aggro range of another one to get to me.  It also helps me find one that might be hiding.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
I find the spectral champion much tougher than keepers, but that might be because I keep resistance buffs on.  With keepers, I don't bother to root until they try to melee.  In a straight out nuking contest, they don't stand a chance against a cleric.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

I tried but just not possible for a cleric to go deeper without friends.  Very easy to get train and I got hate by the lower group in zoneline quickly  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Where exactly is the Goo house?  The deepest I can go is the 2nd gate after a big garden.  There I got 7 mobs on me and I have to gate.  I wish someone is nice enough to share me how the pathing work there  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
Even the greens still give xp if you're solo. Virtually no one in the zone and you have a zone line right there, so there's no need to have a slot spent on gate.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll try the CoM tonight.<br />

There are 2 open area at left and right side after you pass 2nd gate. There is a arena like house between these 2 area and there are 3 goo spawn in it. There is the goo house. You can pull to either left or right side. There are like 11 or 12 mobs in the houses at that area. Range from 35 to 47, I think. The goo spawns at the middle of goo house is 45 to 47.</div></div><hr />
