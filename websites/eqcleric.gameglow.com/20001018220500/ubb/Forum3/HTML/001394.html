</FONT><HR>I finially got Grimrot's heart this morning at about 5:30am CST. I just wanted to recap what I learned from this camp.<P>The PH no longer despawns. You have to kill it. <BR>And when you kill it is the important part. If you want to an undead Grimrot then he needs to spawn at night. If you want the live version then he must spawn in the day.<P>So decide on what game time you would like the Grim to spawn and add 9 game hours to that time and kill the PH then. For example I wanted the undead Grim, and I decided that I wanted him to spawn at around 8PM game time. So I kept the PH alive until 5AM norath time and then killed him. The spawn time is somewhat imprecise. It is best to come back in 3 RL hours and then wait for the spawn. The spawn is usually between 195 min to 216 min.<P>I had been doing the above for several RL days and I was still getting the PH. I read somewhere, dont remember where, to kill the two putrids( tolon and bozin) close to his spawn site. So I show up at three hours and start immediatly killing Tolon and Bozin, Woohoo undead Grimrot spawns, which is then KSed by an evil SK. <P>OK at this point the game time is around 9PM and Grim has been killed and the spawn is due to spawn again at noon game time. So I came back in 3 hours, kept the PH alive until 5AM game time and killed him. Came back in 3 hours started killing Tolon and Bozin and got a PH, One thing different about this time was that there was a low level necro harvesting bone chips from the camp so the camp was disturbed. Reset the ph again, came back 5:15AM rl time this morning. No one is around and started killin Tolon and Bozin. Lord Grimrot spawns and I now have his heart.<P>So does killing Tolon and Bozin and having an undisturbed camp make Grim spawn? Dont know, however for the previous 3 days I had been killing the ph to get him to spawn at 9PM game time and I always got the PH. And by only killing Tolon and Bozin I got Grimrot.<P>Nevik Lightbringer<BR>42 Paladin of the Order of the Divine Light<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I found out through several sources that this guy was posting messages at various boards about me. I don't read this board and any responses here will not be seen by me.<P>The situation. I log in and decide to camp Grimrot sit down in SK, PH is not up and Nevik is not on (I knew he had been there on days previous). Time comes for the PH and Nevik promptly logs in. I'm sitting on the canopy that it spawns under. Kill the PH and he logs. Next PH same thing. Here is when the problem occurs. Now after 8 hours of sitting here waiting Grimrot finally spawns, (he logs in like 15 minutes previous). I attack and kill the PH and he accuses me of KSing (I logged my cleric in immediately after killing it to loot).<P>Lemme put this situation in anohter light. Some guy logs in every thirty minutes for the AM placeholder and lower guk. After that he promptly logs out, he does this for a week. While he's logged out somebody moves in to camp it, he still logs in for every PH. On the 3rd PH after the guy started camping it AM spawns SMR drops... Does anyone really care aqbout the guy showed up for every PH? I mean it's sad and all, but you left your camp.<P>--Leafweir<P>[Flame Mode-On]<P>ps He continued to harass me in tells about KSing the damned thing until I threatened to report him about it. So the moron decides to harass me on the boards. My rep is good, ask anyone on Druzzil (besides this fool). Some people are just too dumb for their own good.<P>[Flame Mode-Off]<P>I got the live Grimrot in an undisturbed camp after a server reset</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Leafweir responded to this message and his name is nowhere in this message. Here is my response to his message.<P><BR>Ok Leafweir thinks he had rights to the spawn and I think I had rights to the spawn. I had been there for every spawn for days. He had not. I had spent days killing the putrids in every order and playing with the camp trying to figure out how to make Grimrot spawn. I spent hours researching this. Leafweir joins the camp and is just then starting to learn the camp. I have already spent my time learning the camp. I am the one who started killing the PH at a particular time to get him to spawn when he did. I am the one who killed the PH to set the spawn up on the day in question. I am the one who set up the spawn and I am also the one who was killing Tolon and Bozin to help spawn Grimrot. Jury is still out on whether that helps or not. I only needed the heart to finish my quest and he was just starting his quest. <BR>You guys were comparing me to others who camp a rare spawn so they can farm the stuff. the Aegis is no drop, so I want to use the shield not farm it. Leafweir was farming the shield for an alternate character.<P>One day I hope Verant will fix this spawn so it is not such a pain.<P><BR>But this does bring up issues on rares and who owns the spawn, the people who have been trying for days to get the rare drop or the people who just show up and get lucky and dont know of all of the effort put in by another person to get the said spawn to spawn.<P><BR>I would like peoples thoughts on this manner. If people think I was wrong then I would like to know it. If people think leafweir was wrong I would like to know. If people think it was just a bad misunderstanding then I would like to here that also.<BR>Nevik Lightbringer<BR>Druzzil Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Nevik,<P>I am pretty sure I followed the thread, and while I love the work you have done (and plan to try it out tonight,) I need to agree with the Leafweir IF I read this correctly.<P>It seemed liked you were logging in every 3 hours to check the camp. While Leaf was sitting there for the entire three hours. We have had this discussion a WHILE ago when it came to the Babbinsbort, Sludge, etc. and other cleric camps. The way I have have alwasy viewed it, and I think most of the folks here have viewed it, is that if you leave the spawn (go somewhere else, log off, etc.) you lose your place at the spawn.<P>If while you are gone, someone moves in and sets up camp there, it is their spawn. You weren't there and the camp was vacant, therefore Leaf was first in line.<P>Skrimgeour Kuchenhyrst<BR>Vicar of Mithaniel Marr<BR>Interguild Liaison for The Haven<BR>Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>A little clarification. The last few days before the Grimrot spawn I was logging in every three hours. Waited for the PH or Grimrot to spawn. When the PH spawnd I kept it alive until the time I thought he should die, so I would get another chance for the undead Grim, then I would kill the PH. Prior to then I had been learning the spawn trying different combinations of killing putrids so forth. Remember that V had changed the spawn and no one really new what it took to get Grim to spawn again.<P>Back to logging in every 3 hours.<BR>Notice my use of I abouve. I was the one setting up the spawn and making sure he would spawn when I wanted him to.  Sometimes Leaf was there and he helped and we discussed the spawn, A lot of times he was not there. Sometimes his character was there on a ground using feign death. So obviously the man behind the character was not there. I was there at every spawn from Wednesday on except one. I went LD and a cyclops got me (.<BR>Leaf said he was there during the whole event. He was not there during the whole event. He was only there for a part of the event. If anyone was there during the whole event I was. <BR>Someone else mentioned somewhere else that I would have not shared Grim with anyone. Rolish was at the spawn when I started camping the spawn. If he had stayed at the spawn the whole week I would have let him loot first.<P>Nevik Lightbringer<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Wow Nevik....<P>Your plan makes sense. Verdant has said all along that there was a trick. Having the spawn linked to day or night is a trick that even makes sense.

</FONT><HR>Nevik, it was wonderful of you to do all the research on this spawn (thank goodness I already have my ageis and never have to do this stupid camp again), and you may have done a lot of us who read the boards a favor. However, I also have to agree with Leafweir. You may have tried to set up the spawn to pop at night. You may have been there for every pop for 5 years, but past history shouldn't count, you were not at the camp, having logged off. Leafweir comes by, sees that it is not camped at all, and begins to camp it, so it is his camp.<P>If you try this trick of logging off for 3 hours, the advantage is you dont have to sit at your computer waiting the whole boring time, and the spawn may be waiting for you still uncamped when you do get back. The disadvantage is that if some other person comes by and decides to wait for it, you've lost the camp. *shrugs* my two pennies, anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>more info on Grim spawn<P>I got the camp and the PH was up.  I killed the PH at 15:22 EST and it was 3pm gametime<P>at 18:49 EST (3 hour and 27 minute spawn) and 12pm gametime Live Grimrot spawned.  I was horribly upset because I only need the heart and can't solo live grim so I got a freind to come out and help<P>Finally at 19:25 EST, midnight game time (I was syncronizing the spawn for night) Live Grimrot died. Unfortunately his scythe went to waste since I had one and my friend was a ranger <sigh>.<P>I waited for the next cylce.. at 22:59 EST (3 hour and 34 minute spawn) and 11pm gametime.. the place holder spawned.. I just dismissed him and camped.. another fruitless day at grimrot.<P>As far as triggers.. I can see none.  The fact that live grim spawned during the day may lend some credence to the day/night live/dead idea, but it could be coincidence. Some of the skellies and putrids were dead when live spawned but the two beside him were spawned and untouched.. same as when the place holder popped.  <BR>I beleive the whether you get a PH or a Grim is definately random and has no trigger.  Although I wouldn't be suprised if the day/night thing is true despite some naysayers<P>Kaharz Stronginthearm<BR>35th lvl cleric Rodcet Nife<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
