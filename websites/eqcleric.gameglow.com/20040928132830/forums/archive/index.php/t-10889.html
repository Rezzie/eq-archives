<br />
Well I had the experence last night of doing I guess my first real uber velious fight that was won.  I teamed up with a larger guild that took down Velketor the Sorcerer.  Only took two attempts.<br />
<br />
We had a total of 4 clerics there, 2 level 60s a level 57, and me, a level 57 as well.  When we lost the first attempt, my group asked me why I was not DLing in-between complete heals of the other two clerics, when shouted instruction was for me to take over CHes when original cleric shouted that they were oom.  I said that my instruction was to heal only when the primary cleric was oom.  They said well no, you take over CH when primary cleric is oom, but use DL in between CHes and when primary goes oom then use the remaining mana you have to CH in their place.<br />
<br />
I did this the next time, we still lost the primary tank, but the secondary tank was able to finish up and we were victorious.  I even won the snow storm mask or whatever - not a good loot item considering the difficulty, but hey it was better than I had in my fact slot before.<br />
<br />
What are the common strategies for these kinds of fights?  I would like to help out any guild that needs me on my server, but I feel that maybe had I been DLing in between CHes, we might have done it on the first try, so in essense, i think i might have screwed up.  What do I need to know in the future for these kinds of fights? (Rallos statue, Zland, Cazic Thule, Velketor, etc).<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Sure, velk quads for 850, but he seemed to do it REALLY slowly.  Like, an 850 quad then cast 3 gfluxes in a row, then 850 quad, then 3 gfluxes in a row, etc.  The difficulty was there, but he was a REALLY slow melee from what I could tell, compared to what I've seen from other mobs.<br />

The Druids are responsible for providing backup healing (and Shamans when/if mob is slowed), as well as Paladins using their LOH as backup heals. However if you didn't have any druids or shamans to backup heal, they should have decided beforehand if you were to be doing CH or backup/filler heals.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">08-27-2001, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that can really help is using assist healing.<br />
<br />
Make a the following hotkey<br />
/assist assistperson<br />
/assist<br />
<br />
That will target the mob your fighting then assist him to see who he is currently attacking.  Then I use CE or DL to cover heal.  Basically a cover heal is a heal like Divine Light that keeps the tank alive just long enough for the CH to land.<br />
<br />
Flurry mobs can make life interesting, 1 flurry mob can take a 6200 hp tank to under a bubble in one combat round if they get 2 flurry procs.  Vs. these I use duck healing.  I start a CH on the warrior, even if they are at full life.  Then if 5 seconds into the fight they are still full life I cancel and start the CH over, if they are taking damage, even if only a little, I coninue casting.   at 9 seconds into the cast, if the tank is down 1 or more bubbles life I finish casting the ch, otherwise I duck.  On a 6200 hp tank, a 1 bubble ch is much more mana efficient than a divine light.<br />
<br />
My guild doesn't really rely on main tanking like a lot of guilds, we have 3-4 warriors with top notch equipment, they spread to damage between them.  <br />
<br />
Thats not to mention our uber monks and a shaman that tank better than your average warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vage</div><div class="date">08-27-2001, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont you find with aggro spreading across more than one warrior that mobs tend to a) ping pong more and b) attach themselves to the enchanters, shaman, etc faster?  I've found that doing things like Kraggrek the slayer and Dlammaz in Kael, Ixiblat Fer, etc...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">08-28-2001, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah primary tanking is not the only way to go unless you're the sort of guild which gives all the melee equipment to one warrior and then lets him tank everything. In general its good to just know how to control agro so you have alternatives. There are mobs that we primarytank (as an example here I'll give Kreizenn and Tormax) and mobs that we certainly don't (CT, Yelinak, Dain). It all depends quite a bit on how you're used to doing it, but in general the important thing is everyone knows when they will get agro and how to get rid of it, then you can adjust tactics for specific encounters fairly easy.<br />

Problem is the &quot;all your eggs in one basket&quot;  If you have half your clerics keeping 1 warrior alive, and he losses agro, dies, goes ld your in a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
Both methods can work very well.  Just mearly stating why we use one method and how I heal under that cicumstances.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">08-30-2001, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My comment was there to mostly reflect the 'eggs in one basket' approach of these guilds  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif Hell if you don't have overflow of equipment you don't need the primary tank to LD or lagburst to kill him or whatnot, you're in some trouble simply if he doesn't log on.<br />
<br />
We have 5 or 6 warriors with ~6k hp buffed etc, so usually we spread agro around since we can afford to, but sometimes primary tanking is just simpler. Primary tanking has inefficient healing (CH &gt; DL always), risks a lot if you reflect the primary tanking in equipment distribution and just plain risks lots with the LDs and stuff. On the other hand it is sorta foolproof. Agro passing TOO hard hitting mobs causes its own problems especially if the target mob gets low hp agro easy... I can't really fathom Vyemm being agro passed for one.<br />
<br />
Oh and other benefit of primary tanking is that it can increase your melee damage compared to agro passing if you do it right. Still, there's usually some death and destruction once the primary tank dies, so in a long fight it's bit questionable if you win in damage if you have deaths when a new tank steps up.<br />
<br />
As I said, we use both, totally situation dependant. Yelinak, Dain and CT are the mobs I'd never suggest primary tanking, and Vyemm is the one I'd never try to agro pass  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
My guild uses main tanking for most mobs, including Cazic and Yelinak. The only non-trivial mob we fight with aggro spreading is Sontalak.<br />
<br />
Main tanking allows us to make highly efficient use of healing and maximizes the effect of damage shields (we have very few bards so this is a particular problem for us).<br />
<br />
Mobs with knockback (Vyemm, Yelinak, Cazic) pose the greatest challenge to a main tank tactic. We have special variations on main tanking that we use against knockback mobs.<br />
