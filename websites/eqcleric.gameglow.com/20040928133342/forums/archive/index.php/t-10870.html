<br />
Trak is a poison dragon. The bulk of deaths from Trak are a result from the poison DoT killing people. Abolish poison will take the DoT off, but it's a long cast. Don't even bother with Complete Heal as you won't ahve time to get a cast off.<br />
<br />
Make sure you give everyone full HP buffs (including Symbol). Resist Poison and DMF are standard for this raid.<br />
<br />
There aren't any real tactics on the cleric end for the rush. Just have people call when poisoned and hit them with Abolish. Celestial Heal can keep them alive now if you have time to get it off.<br />
<br />
Make sure people start calling out poisoned after the raid is over. Trakanon is the dragon who keeps killing long after he's dead. Watched 10 people fall down dead after Trak last time.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

I don't think I had noticed this before, but on the last trak run I made awhile back I believe I recall seeing this.  Somebody please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd almost swear to it.<br />

The only reason people die from the dot in my groups are if they are out of range...or I get ported to shrooms, or just plain meleed to death. :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was just wondering whats the lowest number of people the different servers have used to kill ole Trak.  We are now able to do it on Test with only 18 evn though we were wiped 8 months ago.  Was wondering if FoH or Afterlife had done it with 12 or so by now.<br />
Just wondering.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jassie</div><div class="date">03-06-2001, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">here s my 2 cents: (if u or ur guild new to Trak)<br />
groupage: either tanks group or casters group, i dont like mixed  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
timing: time the respawn of Juggs n buffs<br />
clr dont arrgo 2 early: avoid AE by DA/DB, sit in first 20sec after group heal etc., nothing worst than got ported to shroom area with 90mana  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
tell ur groupmate keep close before the charge: many ppl esp. many casters misthink they r more safe standing far from Trak --&gt; oor from ur healing range (target heal or group heal).<br />
after Trak down, somehow ppl posioned always running like mad n yell for help whihc make u impossible to target em, tell em stop n stand next to wall<br />
dont stuck by the rock in left wall  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif</div></div><hr />

We beat our way through the Juggs then they try to position trak in the lair... this part seems to take hours.   I hate Trak raids because of that.  What do other people do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really don't want to wait, have a cleric (who's bound outside), group with a necro. Cleric DA's and pulls Trak to the back and dies, zones back in, gets summoned and rezzed back in camp.<br />
<br />
Now trak is in back for 15mins, for easy lair clearing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a problem with DA moving Trakanon, though. If the cleric (or paladin) lives long enough to get ported to shrooms, Trakanon will chase after, and may aggro your team, depending on where you are at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakalwe</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, exactly that happened to us one time. We use a necro to DA pull Trak into position, but one time she got ported to the shrooms. As the rest of us charged round into the lair, there was no dragon to be seen... This was the first time I'd heard this could happen, so we sort of mulled around in confusion for a brief while, then got organised and all went to stand at Trak's spawn point. Sure enough, after several &quot;/ooc anyone seen our dragon?&quot;, he popped back into the lair and got the beat-down he so deserved. Was funny at the time.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Just sit the raid in the water...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aliudyen</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried it...still risky.  Anymore it doesnt matter but in the earlier days of doing Trakanon it did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just realized I'm unclear why Trak needs to be repositioned. (Oops, just found out why, we pull him back to his spawn point)<br />
<br />
Now that Pally's can't get aggro'd while DA'd what do you do?<br />

We have absolutely no reason to kill him.   We prefer his big brothers like Yelinak and hopefully soon Vulak'Aerr.</div></div><hr />

If you are the only person left alive and you are invulnerable, it will still chase you and wait for it's chance to chomp on you =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I think I found out why our trak raids are so heinously long.  We wait for him to path back to his lair which can take an hour.  <br />
<br />
Do others do this?  Or do you lead him back on a harness, so to speak.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we used to do him with two paladins going in with DA. After a shroom port and the second paladin not getting the aggro fast enough on him so did Trak take a dive down towards the rest of the people at the bridge, we simply decide to charge up anyway.<br />
<br />
We waited up there and he came back to us soon enough to die as usual.<br />
<br />
So he hit us with a AoE, one AoE heal and it was fixed, np.<br />
