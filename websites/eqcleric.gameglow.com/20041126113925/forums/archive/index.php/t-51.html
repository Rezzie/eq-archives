<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traveling Poet</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">for providing me with the exact reason I post to EQ-Cleric and Stratics and no where else.<br />
<br />
She started this thread there:<br />
 http://vnboards.ign.com/message_flat.asp?topic=5766290&amp;page=1 <br />
<br />
And the quality of the posts there is appallingly low. The people there have no control, no sense of style, and they can't even flame without resorting to profanity and namecalling. At least when I flame, I light a frigging bonfire  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
<br />
I really like this forum. I hope it never gets as bad as I see there.<br />
<br />
BTW, please don't re open this topic here. I only mean to draw attention to the flames and such, not drag up an arguement that is not going to go anywhere.<br />

<br />
And at least on that board, you don't have to start a new unlocked thread to carry on the same discussion =p</div></div><hr />

That was totally uncalled for.  Don't be starting flame wars here.  We have enough problems with flames and such without intentionally makeing more.<br />
<br />
Closing thread now.<br />
