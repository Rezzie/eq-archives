<br />
Primary character is a 39th ranger. I recently started a cleric and he is currently level 20. Whenever I play my cleric everyone I group with generally complements me on what an awesome cleric I am!! As a ranger I rarely get any complements other than &quot;nice pull.&quot; Does that mean I make a better cleric than a meleer? Or do clerics just get a lot of complements by nature?  =) I have a lot of fun playing both, but if I am cut out to be a cleric then so be it!!<br />
<br />
On another note ... I think i make a decent cleric because I have played a melee class long enough that I know what I want out of a cleric in a group.  By playing the cleric do you think it will make me a better tank because of the same reason?<br />
<br />
Let's dicuss  = )</div></div><hr />

When you are playing a melee class, obviously you see at what point (if you pay attention to your health bar) people are healing you and vice versa.  When you playing the cleric, you can gauge how much damage the tanks are taking from certain things and stuff like that.  It is all relavent to each other.<br />

I didn't see the 12 feign deaths that the monk does to break up a full spawn, or the number of times the warrior dies trying to figure out the aggressive radius on his route back to the room.<br />
<br />
Mostly, I just know:  &quot;Bad pull! Evac! Evac!&quot;  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, most people know they're about to die, and yet miraculously don't...  &quot;Nice heal!&quot;<br />
<br />
For giggles, try learning to pull as a cleric.  Root, Atone, Soothe, Invis to Undead, stun-pulling, fear-kiting, Divine Aura, cross-zone gating...  It's exciting - and you get a whole new respect for that warrior that can pull a constant stream of single blues all night from a nearly empty zone.</div></div><hr />
