<br />
Unrest<br />
Without a doubt a money machine, I was making 200pp+ in a 5 hour night camping the Magi or the Hand Room with a full group.  If there were two or three groups in the zone the Bar or the Tower also become accessible.<br />
<br />
The Magi room is wicked as Blood Stained Gloves go for 125pp+ and a cap for 50pp+ and as long as you let nothing run out of the room, you never get trained.  The Magi spawn is a little slow however compared to the barkeep.<br />
<br />
The zone is deadly for beginners, so until you learn to use the trains, expect to have to zone or die a lot.  There are also a heap of great items that you can pick up like The Savants Cap, The Thick Leather Apron and of course the Blood Stained Tunic.<br />
<br />
If the zone is empty, You can beat upon the Gnome and what ever spawns with him under the waterfall with only a Tank for backup, later on 27+ you can solo the waterfall, the spawn is a little slow, but good value.<br />
<br />
High Pass Keep<br />
Is just XP gone crazy, in 4 hours in the Warrior room I made 4 bubbles of XP, money is shocking I have only been making about 40pp per night and that is if you are lucky enough to have a bronze armour drop.<br />
<br />
Ears are an added bonus, turned into the Captain at the end of the night you can expect to get an extra 1/4 of a bubble of XP at the least.<br />
<br />
Expect to sit behind your spell book for the whole night here.  Most things you fight are yellow or red so you just have to heal, heal, heal, buff, heal and watch that XP roll in.  In the few instances when I have tried to cast a spell like Calm or Inspire Fear to clear a room, the mob has always resisted and has chased after me delivering those really fun 69HP double hits.  <br />
<br />
While I have only died in this zone once so far, I have used divine armour here more than any other zone I have played in, Gobs agro on you like crazy and because you are always having to heal, taunt just doesn’t seem to work sometimes.  My view is that any group who can’t get the mob off you before it does 4 bubbles of damage to the Cleric had better be able to live without that Cleric while I run to the bank to heal myself.  (I tried to heal myself in the room we were fighting in once, big mistake  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif, as I said, I have died here once so far)<br />
<br />
The only problem I have found with the Keep is that it’s really easy to get the lower groups killed if you have to train.  As there is a big distance to the zone and the guards are next to unless, if you pull a warrior or raider up the stairs you come back down to see 6 very unhappy level 20’s picking up their corpses.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, hope this helps.<br />
