<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nizdaar</div><div class="date">03-31-2000, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had an awesome night last tonight.  Fought in paw with one group, then in kedge at the zone with my guild, and a rogue I'd played with in CT a while back.<br />
<br />
We managed to kill the fierce impaler with a way underpowered group.  What a rush...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the night is over, and I gate out of Kedge to my bind point at the cave entrance to unrest (by waters edge) because I'm feeling lazy.  As I'm zoning, I go AFK.  I hear somone getting hit badly, rush to my screen to see if I can help... and it's Dwingus beating the crap out of me!<br />
<br />
I hit DB and shout that I need help killing Dwingus at the unrest zone (I was at 10m at the time  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif ).<br />
<br />
A 34 ranger said he could take him, so I sit down, and med and heal him as fast as I can, a nearby paly LoH's the ranger, and a mid 20's druid who is almost OOM to start is healing this ranger as well.<br />
<br />
Throughout the whole thing, the I'm trying to explain to the ranger that I would like to loot the ingot (or is it icon?).<br />
<br />
Anyway... the ranger is down to 5% health, while I'm screaming at him to zone.  I run to the zone with him and stand there, while the 21 paly and druid try and take Dwingus out while he's swinging at me.  I manage to zone with 20HP.  Hit DA and zone back into Dagnor's (not the smartest move).<br />
<br />
I come back to see the druid and paly dead (doh!  now I feel bad).  I see dwingus heading for the water and follow him.  I send a tell to the ranger exactly where to find him, 1 DD later (from a ranger, hehe), Dwingus is dead.<br />
<br />
Then the ranger says he isn't going to let me have the icon because he as a level 21 cleric!  ARGH!<br />
<br />
Shortly there after he finds out that the Pally and Druid died, and that he wants the paly to loot it.  So he sits there, crouched at the corpse so I couldn't get it once it went public.<br />
<br />
I try talking to the guy, but he isn't budging.  I'm not letting this icon rot, so I run back, and revive the paly. When the paly gets to the corpse of Dwingus, the ranger has looted the icon!<br />
<br />
ARGH!<br />
<br />
Fine.  I tell the ranger never to ask me for a revive, xp or otherwise ever.<br />
<br />
His tune changes suddenly, and he is willing to help me to the quest, if we go right away.<br />
<br />
... silence from me<br />
<br />
Okay... not it's at 9pm tomorrow night that he will help me finish it (I already have the other peice, just need the enchanted plat bars).<br />
<br />
/quit<br />
<br />
I'm just so sick and tired of spending hours of my time helping others get their quest stuff, and then getting this crap.<br />
<br />
When I had 1 quest bracer, I helped several clerics get their first one, even though I was waiting long before them for Regis.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should go for that &quot;me! me! me!&quot; train of thought... but I know I just can't.  Oh well, someone just screwed themselves out of xp rezzes from me, or anyone else in my guild (all 3 clerics, hehe).<br />
<br />
Oh well, time to go back in, med up, and hop back in when Dwingus is due back up in the morning.<br />

<br />
When I was camping a cleric quest item, if I logged on and someone else was camping it, I would help the other person camp it for as long as I was on-line.  I did meet druids that were camping the items occasionally, but they were genuinely camping them for their friends.<br />
<br />
I did have one bad experience, but I did not let that affect me.<br />
<br />
All true clerics would either :<br />
<br />
1) Try to help the person camping the item<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2) Leave the camp and try another day<br />
<br />
Well, that is...in my experience anyway<br />
<br />
There are a few rogues out there, but we must learn to deal with them harshly.<br />

Sorry to hear it went like that.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

All you can do is maintain your own dignity and decency and let the storm rage around you.  Don't let it change you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While camping the paw people were amazed that I would spend all that time there helping them kill Mitty over, and over, and over again, and keep them company (meanwhile, 30 was smacking me in the head over and over).  I made tons of friends, found a new guild, and figured out something important.<br />
<br />
I hate 95% of all 40+ druids.<br />
<br />
Not only are they so unbalanced that they are great for soloing, but they can ks better than anyone, short a wizzie with IC.  Sitting there getting the camp stolen after 20 minutes of doing it myself (barely, which I got the camp after waiting for OTHER people to leave, nice and fair like) not once but TWICE drove me insane.  Pissed me off.<br />
<br />
So, I made the exact same threat, and promised to warn every single cleric that I know (and after the paw, I know about 15 30+ clerics, including 4 lvl 50's) and they laughed at me.<br />
<br />
The next day I got a tell from one of my 50 cleric friends that the very same druid that ks'd me asked for a rez and she refused, as well as warned the other clerics in the zone not to.  Not only did that druid lose her level, but she could not get a rez within the 2 hour period (though in 5 hours I heard she got a revive to her corpse which was in a plane).<br />
<br />
People can be so incredibly stupid in this game, and I haven't figured out why on earth they could make it to 30+ when they can't tie their own shoes probably.  I'll love it when I hit 39 and all the morons that have ks'd, trained, or generally been rude shout for a rez.  <br />
<br />
Theres nothing like a woman scorned, especially when she has your life in her hands!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daine</div><div class="date">03-31-2000, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn, some people just dont think. Your lucky you know those clerics, because I only know 5-6 maybe 10 total high lvl clerics.... Course I could take over the world with the other 10 friends I have on my list an THIER connections... For some reason I seem to be really lucky with the quests. On the gauntlets the paladin who was campin Babbinsbort gave it up to me (I knew spawn time and came back within an hour of it, he was only camping for his gf), now he and I are good friends and are helpin each other with the armour and other cleric stuff, the other time was when a 38+ warroir swam to look for the other half of the gauntlets, missing them by about 5 min. His eb ran out just before he got back to the hole... After he got a 39 res, Tundra Jack ran by an killed him again. I asked what he was after and he told me.... for some reason he logged right after I told him how close he was to ingot. Then on killing babbinsbort I had asked a paladin and druid who were lookin for bone chips if they would help, we took him down easy. Then I ran over to kerra, found 2 guild friends there one a high lvl druid who helped me kill Maugrim. I just some people are just an asshole magnet or somethin....<br />
