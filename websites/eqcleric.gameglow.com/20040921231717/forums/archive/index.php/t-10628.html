<br />
I made the last 2 bubbles of level 34 in a little over 3 hours.  This is a fast furious action place.  I was in a full group that was tank heavy and we were killing only lightweight mobs (Greater Kobolds and Greater Kobold Shamans).  It is a LOT of fun if (a) you are not the type to panic (since stuff that kills level 50's sometimes makes its way to the zoneline (b) you are not claustrophobic (because lord there is no maneuver space in there whatsoever particularly at the zone line; and (c) you are good at managing your mana or persuading bards or enchanters to hunt with you.<br />
<br />
I'm planning to stay for a while, I think.  At least until I get up enough courage to try to visit Mistmoore again LOL.<br />

I am still undecided about where to hunt at my level... My hubby (a 35th Druid) and I kill Griffons, Hill giants and what ever else we can find.  I have been to Mistmoore Castle recently and there seems to be a good chance for exp there as long as you are in a good, full group.  <br />

Can't speak for the older servers, but on Tribunal I have never had to wait for a group in Sol B. I usually get a group before I even zone in, either in tells or invites from groups at the zoneline.<br />
<br />
To be totally honest, once I did have to wait about two minutes after I made an /ooc...<br />

With the exception of one HG/Griff/Dragoon romp through West Commons, I spent all of 35-39 at Sol B. Window room is safest, off most train paths. Ramp room gets some fun trains of bugs, bats, and the Kobold Noble. Did not go up to the King/Champ/Priest area yet (gotta save SOMETHING for later).<br />
<br />
Made a level per day, with about 8 hours played per day.<br />
