<br />
Vague location per Morolinith's map would also be appreciated.  Any experiences with the local wild life in reference to this drop would also be appreciated.  Also if it is a common or rare drop would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
(Example: It's a pain to get, you have to break room with 2 swirlspines and 3 pirranha... don't use aoe's or you might pull the frenzied shark etc.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatianna Val'sharess</div><div class="date">01-20-2000, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a word of warning about Kedge, keep buffs going full time.  The Mermaids are druids and pack some hefty damage spells and the usual DoT's.  At one point, we had a pull of 3 of them and I began casting full heal on our SK puller when she was a 60% life remaining, and she died before it went off.  Also, I'm not sure where the critter came from in the dungeon, but we killed Cauldronbubble and I was lucky enough to get the sharkbone warhammer (8/26 +5wis).  It appears to be the rare drop though.<br />
<br />
Another word of warning:  An unfriendly caster in the area can get your whole party killed as we found out in a fight at the zone when some jerk started randomly dispelling us to get our EB.  Having a mage or bard along is a huge boost because of the water stones or water breathing song.  Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />
