I thought it might be nice to have a stickied thread that contained a summary of the knowledge that has been shared in this forum.<br />
<br />
As a starting point here's the list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://legends.everquest.station.sony.com/devview.jsp?o=43133&quot;&gt;&quot;Tiers and Targets&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from Verant's site with some additions of my own (denoted by ?):<br />

Emperor Ssraeshza <br />
Lord Inquisitor Seru <br />
<br />
What I would like to see is the other mobs placed reasonably correctly into the Tiers.  Once that is complete perhaps we can put some basic info in on each mob (Damage output, approx hps, special abilities) leaving spoilers out of it.  I'm not opposed to spoilers per se, but some people are and regardless that information is better suited to a regular post as a spoiler from one guild might not work well for my guild due to differences in player ability, character equipment, numbers, etc.<br />
<br />
**edits**<br />
-&gt; I removed the ?s, and made a few minor adjustments.  Also added Sontalak.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Yael DT's and Nortlav is practice for Venril.<br />
<br />
-&gt; I didn't put anything from Vex Thal here.  This list is not for those playing on that level.<br />
<br />
-&gt; Removed &quot;pre-Tiering&quot; as I suppose every other mob could go there.  I'm not interested in listing mobs like the Fungoid Spore King, so out the section goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could probably remove tier 5 and put creator in 4 and tunare in 6.<br />
<br />
Blood should go in same tier as HP, not emp.  Blood is a real wuss if you have your offtanking management down.<br />

Brambodius Tanglefoot<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see here, a lot of this is my feelings but I'll try and explain them away.<br />
<br />
Rumblecrush: Move to Tier 2.  He's about Velk level difficulty.  He doesn't have many HP but he Rampages like a fiend and can destroy a raid force fast if they get unlucky with slow.<br />
<br />
Ring of Slime: I'd move this to Tier 2 as well.<br />
<br />
Veeshan's Peak: As a whole I'd put the Raid at Tier 3.  This one gets overlooked a lot due to the annoyance factor.<br />
<br />
Telkanor (sp?): Add him to Tier 3 where Gozz and LTK already sit.<br />
<br />
Sevalak: Add him to Tier 3.  He's the easiest dragon in NToV but the pull can be a pain in the ass since he's a Triplet.  Once you get him, he dies fast and easy though.<br />
<br />
Lord Vyemm: Move him to Tier 5.  He's the toughest dragon in NToV IMO.  Even with good strat and positioning, he can still cause headaches.<br />
<br />
Zlexak: I think he's fine here in Tier 4.  He's tough but by no means the tougest NToV Dragon.  His nasty AOE is compensated for by his low hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Aaryonar: I think he's fine here.  If done right he's not hard but it's a steep learning curve and always an intense fight.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I agree with things.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for replying =).<br />
<br />
I'm currently loathe to fiddle with rankings from the official Verant site, although I'm certain you are correct on the Blood and will do that move.  I just don't want to remove that tier 5 yet since Verant uses it and I have a suspicion that &quot;tiering&quot; will become a large part of our future.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I'm doing as suggested with the exception of Zlexak.  Want more feedback before moving him to eliminate &quot;guild capability&quot; variation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... wants to move down the table, preferably to somewhere between Orc Pawn and Moss Snake.<br />
<br />
You could add Doomshade to Tier 2, and there's a definite distinction between 350 Dain and 425 Dain which is worth noting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-17-2002, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We talking about just the mobs themselves or all the clearing needed to get to them? For example, Tunare herself is no harder than your average NToV dragon... however, killing Ail so you get the shot at her is a task worthy of an AoW capable guild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cael</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know you are loathe to shake up VI tiers, but I think they are a little inaccurate.  Although of course the composition of your guild would determine relative difficulties.  <br />
<br />
 For NToV dragons, I would keep Vyemm and Aary in Tier 5.  (although Aary is pretty much gimped now with his pets not always coming with him).<br />
<br />
I would keep Dagarn and Zlex in Tier 4, and move all the rest into Tier 3.  <br />
<br />
I think Grieg is a better fit at tier 3, and honestly Tunare at 3 as well.<br />
<br />
I would also throw Sontalek into tier 4.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikeren</div><div class="date">08-18-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pre-teiring also needs:<br />
Terrisnia<br />
Brajakor the cold<br />
Protectors of Zek<br />
Kael Arena<br />
Fungiod Spore King <br />
Sebelite Juggernauts<br />
Various hole named mobs (excepting the Death Touching ones)<br />
Getting down into the hole with an ogre as your main tank (almost as many headaches as the raid itself :eek: )<br />
<br />
Maybe Spirit of Radishar/Tarrow in teir one? How bout that over king dude in ME in teir one?<br />
<br />
Dunno much except for the newbie 50+ game lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sevelak - Er, has anyone tried him since the purported change?  Either it was the best kept secret ever, or someone added Gravity Flux for 1200 and no one noticed.  We had killed the other two triplets and the MT, who had killed him many times with his previous guild said 'just charge him, he's a gimp'.  Then the GFluxing started.  Wiped the raid might quick.  Tried to rez up, tried again and respawn got us.   Heck of a shock.<br />
<br />
Idol of Rallos Zek - Verant is trying to be sneaky by putting him on the same level as the AoW, because they don't want people to be able to try him without being able to kill the AoW.  One detail tho, he's slowable.  Makes a some kinda huge difference.  Now, if you can't kill an unslowed Idol, you won't be able to kill the AoW, but still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To my knowledge, Sevelak has always had the grav flux.  It's supposed to be a single target version and, should, only hit the MA.  If you all just charged him, then the Flux is going to go off a lot more and hit a bunch of people as each person draws aggro.<br />
<br />
My Guild started doing NToV back in April and he's always had it.  He IS gimpy though.  He has less than any other dragon in the wing (quite possibly the zone), is easily slowed, and doesn't put out too much damage.  His drops are also sub par.  Great Hybrid/Knight weapons but after killing him a couple of times, you'll have it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailly</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sevelak only ae's two or three times, doesn't matter how you do it. After that he only melee's, and is slowable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raleanae</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of one of the July patches, Tunare has been SERIOUSLY gimped.  She no long knockbacks at all.  I would move her to Tier 3  or even 2... There are folks on our server that can't do TOVn that have killed her now... Sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">08-22-2002, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Zlexak is pure evil :(<br />
he is almost at par with aaryonar IMO.<br />
<br />
Sevelak has very low HP, even though he has massive damage output he is a quick kill.<br />
Dagarn is like a overgrown HOT wurm with 3 or 4 times the HP. he is much easier then Zlexak. <br />
<br />
I would put Zlexak with Aaryonar and Vyem in tier 5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adon</div><div class="date">09-06-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poor Tunare :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Geneze</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only ones of those that I have any useful information on are mobs that I've actually done. According to that list, we are a tier 3 guild, having done Vindicator. <br />
<br />
The only reason I know about those mobs is from the personal experience of us actually killing them, and sometimes friends from higher up guilds giving us tips on them. <br />
<br />
So my question is, is there anywhere I can find more information on ths stuff before we facee the mobs, so we can do a little preparation? <br />
<br />
Example, we went to Grieg's End last weekend for exploration. We spent about 4 hours in there, and really didn't learn much of anything. We never found anything that was particularly difficult. There was plenty of speculation, though: &quot;I've heard we need a key to get to the harder parts&quot;...&quot;how do we get the key?&quot;....&quot;I think a mob in the zone drops it&quot;....&quot;Where is that mob?&quot;....&quot;no idea&quot;. I mean, it was fun, but we didn't really learn anything, and we didn't get any loot worthwhile.The whole thing felt like a total waste of time. I can't help but think if we'd had basic ifnfo before going, we could have had a much more productive raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beauti Fully</div><div class="date">09-10-2002, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I am wrong but I was pretty sure that RoV has only been done by 3 guilds in the game. Also now that resists have changed I think it would be much harder so that may need to be bumped up to 8. Maybe some other people can put some input into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smegal</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RoV is the single hardest event in the game.  I'd make it Tier 8 at the least, possibly 9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowfrost</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A good practise mob for people about to move up to Tier 2 is Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold.<br />
<br />
Use Vindicator tactics, but he has either about half the hp of Vindi or 32k hp and a lot of regen, depending on who you believe.  Also he hits 554 instead of 700 and doesn't rampage.<br />
<br />
Stanos is actually the reward giver for the rogue epic, or alternatively the guy you need to kill for the rogue high elf mask quest.  He doesn't drop much (his own head, needed for the mask quest, drops about 1 in 3) but any rogue with sufficient faction can spawn him again and again, so he's an excellent target for practise purposes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrrha</div><div class="date">09-12-2002, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction hits on killing Stanos though?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mut also keep in mind that with Tunare you will not have all of a guilds raiding force due to faction/roleplaying issues... there will be worshipers of Tunare that will either help kill tunare then intentionally camp/quit/die/gate/port to prevent faction hit... and there are those that enjoy simply roleplaying and will not assist in killing tunare in any way shape or form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">09-20-2002, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well any guild seriously looking to kill Tunare is not going to have people pussying out due to faction hits... at worst they will /q out to avoid the hits.<br />
<br />
Btw Dain (either version) &gt; Yelinak/CT, he should definitely be listed as a Tier 4 mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demad</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm I think id put Rumblecruch up a tier to 3 myself, although he can be done with like 2 groups if that slow doesnt land hes one nasty bugger.<br />
RoV I dont think should be in tier 7, maybe 6 instead or even 5.<br />
We did RoV on our second attempt and appart from the odd moment when we got a few more mobs then we wanted it was fairly easy and fun.<br />
You could also put half the boss mobs in VT on tiers 6-8+ but seeing as you have had to kill Emp(tier8) to get to VT you already know where your guild stands I guess.<br />
Hmm maybe they should make a few more tiers too, Emp + Seru are a picnic compared to some of the other mobs in VT.</div></div><hr />

My guild is around tier 1, and it'd be intresting to see what new mobs we possibly could try (tier 1-2) and which ones are beyond our currect reach (tier 3+). We killed Aramin the Spider Guardian last night and she was about as hard as VS, so I guess she is tier 1 mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Bertoxx</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday my guild had their first real shot at Ikatiar and Eashen (mobs usually drop fast when they pop) - well Eashen popped after we rezzed up from the Ikatiar fight. Here's what I noticed:<br />
<br />
-Ikatiar is a poon. He came unexpected and only me and another cleric in the cycle were really ready, plus two had their hotkeys set to the wrong channel. We managed to kill him but all clerics lost lots of mana, also due to some hatchling adds.<br />
<br />
-Eashen is a bad biznitch...melees in the range of Ixiblat (575) but has a nasty AE that's not easy to resist even with resists at 300+. She wiped us two times before I had to call it a night (5am). I'd definately put her one tier higher than Ikatiar or even drop Ikatiar one tier.<br />
<br />
-The only hard part about Ikatiar is splitting/pulling him. Once he's singled he's no harder than and pure melee mob.<br />
<br />
Idol and AoW might be a tad high on the list...Idol hit us unprepared with 3 adds and we lived for 10 minutes (admittedly with a good MA), all adds got killed and we took Idol to 78% (this was the very first attempt on it). On the second try the fight took 5 minutes and Idol dropped easy. AoW was trained to zones by a griefer so I can't tell how the fight would have gone.<br />
<br />
The list might be changed a little because pure melee mobs are a different world than AE mobs. I mean Ikatiar had no real chance other than the surprise effect and Eashen kicked our butts. In general people should consider AE mobs of a tier effectively half a tier higher than melee mobs in the same tier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Idol is usually ranked high (same as AoW) because on a lot of servers it's considered...tacky...to try him slowed.  Why?  Because if you can't kill him unslowed, you ain't gonna kill the AoW, so you are probably blowing the spawn (yes, yes, I know, everyone gets a shot, but killing a gimped *slowed* mob to get to a mob about as hard that is unslowable really is a waste).  Now once you have proven you can do him unslowed, you have a real shot at the AoW so slowing the idol is just an exercise is saving mana and time CRing..;-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Bertoxx</div><div class="date">12-27-2002, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Today we had our second shot at AoW. Idol dropped fine and we took AoW to 46% on the first try ever. He won mainly because 3 of the clerics in the chain lagged out. With clerics who know when to pay attention and who don't lag he is propably almost as easy as the regular ToV wurm :p. We also did Dain today (first Dain kill for me) and he was harder to kill than Vindi/Statue, lol...mainly because of his way to aggro. Yeli seems fine where he is (horses make this fight easier!), unless people mess around or the MA runs out of healing range.<br />
<br />
All in all it's nice to have a list to see where we stand :). My guild currently stands firmly in tier 4. We'll try to get Tunare sometime but the other mobs in tier 5 are either hard to get to if you don't know the area (Vyemm) or a tad overcamped (the other 3).<br />

My guild has killed everything on the list so far but we haven't really started to put any focus on PoP (VT has been our primary goal and we just went in and killed 2 TVX and got keys for first time yesterday) and have only killed Grummus, AD, and the PoS Lords. <br />
<br />
From my perspective I'd put what we have done as follows:<br />
<br />
Grummus - Tier 6<br />
AD - Tier 7<br />
PoS Lords(all 3) - Tier 6<br />
<br />
We've been looking to give Behemoth a shot but open raids seem to be blowing the spawn alot lately and the one time we did organize to give it a go our server came down... which has been happening alot lately (6 Emp Ssra kills in 7 days).<br />

Where would mobs like:<br />

Doomshade (He is basically a mini vindi. Fewer HP, hit's fast, but not as fast, hard but not as hard. I would put him a tier 2 (I think he could take Gorenier down any day).<br />
Spirits of Radishar and Tawro are both alot harder then any of the kunark dragons. 70k hp, same DPS but no AE. I would put them at Tier one.</div></div><hr />

Vindi is all over, but I cant find anything good on taking down Cazic Thule, f.ex.<br />

  I now some folks appear to think tactics rank with National Security issues and require folks to sign non-disclosure agreements with blood... but, hey, its a game and we are here to share information.<br />

  Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Have clerics in house, get amulet of necro for tank, and go kill him :) you can place the tank with the back to the tree, just dont get CT up the tree :)</div></div><hr />

PoS lords once you learn how to pull them are a joke. Without their adds they are like vindi but with them they are as challenging as AoW or harder because u get so many adds you run out of tanks and healers if you cant keep up w/ dmg cause the fugers go right for the clerics !<br />

All you have to do is have tanks and mages. thats it. hes a poosy. poosy poosy poosy. we did him with 6 wars 2 clerics 3 mages think a ranger, 2 rogues  + shaman and chanter.<br />
<br />
Now yeli is a wimp once you get to him but you gota kill all the way to him unless you have good faction coth. But even though we do we prefer the hard way with gota kill 2 of the crusaders which are a pain in the butt cause they dot and banish like dain does. they have a decent loot table and i dont think they are bad mobs to kill for tier 4-5 guild lootwise. The melee ring they drop is friggen sweet, id look it up.<br />

Keep in mind this is separate from the previous Tier list and has nothing to do with the zone Tiers. This also only my opinion.<br />
<br />
Tier 1<br />
BoT minis<br />
Hedge Quest boss<br />
BoT tower bosses<br />
Tactics minis<br />
Keeper of Souls<br />
<br />
Tier 2<br />
Grummus<br />
Aerin Dar<br />
Saryn<br />
Terris Thule<br />
Vallon Zek<br />
Tallon Zek<br />
Sol Ro minis<br />
Hoh trial dragon<br />
<br />
Tier 3<br />
Behemoth<br />
Bertoxxulous<br />
Mithaniel Marr<br />
Solusek Ro<br />
<br />
Tier 4<br />
Rallos Zek, the Warlord<br />
most Elemental minibosses<br />
<br />
Tier 5<br />
Fenin Ro<br />
Xegony<br />
Corinav<br />
<br />
Tier 6<br />
The Rathe<br />
<br />
A few notes...<br />
<br />
If I had to correlate the old list to this one... Seru and Emporer would be on Tier 2 (yes, the game is that far mudflated). The reason I don't put them higher is that their damage output is anemic compared to most of PoP. I mean the Overseer in Tactics hits harder than Seru and if had a mean AE like Grummus or Aerin I'd put him in Tier 2. Heck, I've seen Seru owned with just 27 65 players and Emp with almost as few. These guys were hard in their day because of the fact that they were marathon fights (even with the top end PoP stuff Seru takes 30+ mins). Saryn is a joke for a deity (though the concept of her fight with Sorrowsong is indeed quite unique). In fact, I'd say Tier 2 has the most innovation in fights (if, albeit obscenely weak mobs).<br />
<br />
The only other debate was over Behemoth. On the one hand he's pretty easy to zerg. On the other, it's a crowd control sideshow with a quick sprint to down the big guy. I gave him Tier 3 because he's clearly harder than the majority of Tier 2 (except maybe Saryn but is debatable) and due to the fact that even those who zerg Behemoth can easily down TZ and VZ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Praetorius</div><div class="date">06-02-2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm tempted to say Behemoth is harder than Aerin'Dar but honestly it might be all strategy.  My guild (VT capable) just downed Behemoth for the first time last night.  We've wiped at least 4 previous times due basically to bad strategy.  We've taken Aerin'Dar 4 or 5 times previous to that.<br />
<br />
Last night when we finally downed Behemoth, we lost less than 6 people.  He went down so fast, we couldn't believe it which is what makes me think the fight is all strategy (and DPS obviously but I don't think that's been our issue).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">woland</div><div class="date">07-26-2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things to add with all these lists posted here:<br />
<br />
Bertoxx is harder than Agnarr.<br />
<br />
You can debate if Saryrn is harder than Agnarr, I'd say yes just from my own experience.<br />
<br />
Inny is far harder than his previous incarnation so yes he does belong on a higher tier, I'm unsure about Maestro.<br />
<br />
Rallos is harder than SolRo<br />
<br />
Coir/Xeg are harder than Fennin and The Rathe is harder than all three (durh statement).<br />
<br />
Rydda'Dar is harder than Aerin, though RD's place on here is up to you.<br />
<br />
Behemoth is a hair harder than AD i'd say, just for the fact that you actually have to strategize some.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sumeine Bertoxx</div><div class="date">11-22-2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The initial tier list was made before PoP was out and before most guilds had 500 warriors and 759 mages, and before the level cap was raised from level 60 to level 65.<br />
<br />
In that time long ago doing Dain (either version) was a lot harder than doing Vindi for example simply because you couldn't rely on defensive discs or mages all with either epic or pets level 60+. Of course the old list is totally outdated nowadays since you can easily get better gear than was available for an average guild at that (far away) time through bazaar, easy mudflated camps and farming LDoN adventure points.<br />
<br />
Doing Dain with 6 clerics, 12 warriors and who knows how many mages is easy now with EP+ gear but at the time I wrote my post about ranking Dain an average guild able to do him was usually happy haveing one, maybe two epic mages and haveing 3 mages online for a raid was considered pure luxury, fate or yet another wonder (let alone haveing loot better than XtC or HP of Ssra at most). And don't forget that level 61+ spells were not available or at least not common so pets were about as useless as our hammer pet is now against any boss mob (some parses showed necro EoT pet dmg (lvl 59 pet) as something around 700ish dmg through a fight of 5 minutes against AoW which is a lot less than such a mob regens over that time...).<br />
<br />
Actually with mudflation now every boss mob of &quot;old EQ&quot; is now trivial since you can fairly easily get better gear than those mobs drop from bazaar or from easier mobs...thus making the encounter easier than it was since your gear is BETTER than what you can get from a given &quot;old EQ mob&quot; (AKA up to SoV boss mobs).<br />
<br />
Always check for a post date in a thread like this before posting another opinion - 9. may 2003 (post replying to &quot;Dain &gt; Yeli) is somehow later than my post (27. dec. 2002) and mudflation (gear/level/AA - wise) was somewhat more advanced at that time and thus made those encounters a lot different than when I faced them.<br />

<br />
Seems to me Grummus is 1, and Aramin is at least 2, but I'm not sure about that.<br />
<br />
Tawro and Radir are barely tier 1, they are easily taken down by decent (non-EP, bazaar geared) groups of 4 or less people.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in the tier 2 mobs, are there levels of difficulty in Tier 2?  I've been part of groups that have managed to take down Velketor with about 8 people, but only with difficulty because of his guards.  Are the other Tier 2 mobs as difficult as Velks with guards, or Velks without guards?</div></div><hr />
