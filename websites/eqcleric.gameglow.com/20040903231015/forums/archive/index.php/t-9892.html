<br />
So, wander down to Guk, get set up, and die to a 39th warrior training Safehall.<br />
<br />
He feels bad about it, and arranges a 49th res for me. Dohner the only 49+ cleric in the zone offers to res me for 300 plat.<br />
<br />
I told him to forget it, Swapped a reso and a Shield of Words for a Sow, ran down to Guk and ressed myself.<br />
<br />
If I was in his guild, I'd be very careful about dying around me, I fear, until I calm down and become my normal, happy self<br />

It is very possible that they were having serious downtime already just from keeping their group alive and buffed.<br />
<br />
Maybe they quoted a price like that just as away of saying &quot;No&quot;<br />
<br />
And maybe they didn't realize you were a cleric.<br />
<br />
I have gotten many a tell saying &quot;Can you res my friend?&quot; without knowing who the friend is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-14-2000, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To ask an exorbitant price is worse than saying one cannot do it. There's a story about Oscar Wilde (I think) where he asks a woman if she will sleep with him for a million dollars. When she says, &quot;Of course!&quot;, he then offers one dollar. To her refusal he says, we've already established what you are, now we are simply negotiating a price. Why 'no' is so hard I cannot understand, even though at 49 I can certainly understand how annoying the barrage of constant requests can be.</div></div><hr />

I'd have just ran back and res'd myself too if I wasn't in Kunark or something.<br />

<br />
Weird similar thing last night - <br />
<br />
Was out in BW with a couple mid-40s friends of mine, keeping an eye on em and making sure they didn't end up as wurm food.<br />
<br />
Just as I'm about to gate back to town, I get a tell from someone I didn't know, then from another person.<br />
<br />
They said their group got wiped out, and could I please rez their cleric?<br />
<br />
Hell yeah I'll go rez your cleric.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  So I did, and didn't charge a penny for it.. even healed and buffed him so he could save mana to rez the rest of his group.<br />
<br />
Then about an hour later, I got a tell from the exit zone in Chardok.  Having had some bad experiences there (namely with an uber guild on Bertoxx), I wasn't feeling too comfortable to go in.  But I went.  Made 500pp for two rezzes, plus I helped em out when they were waiting with some heals.<br />
<br />
I think it all eventually evens out...<br />

<br />
Honestly, I think that Norrath is too small to tick off other Clerics.  We all know the stresses that occur from keeping our suicidal party members alive, stunning those evil mobs Karnor dawgies, and fending off the &quot;Hey, can you run to the 3rd level of Dalnir to res my 29th level friend?&quot; <br />
<br />
Heck, most of the time, I tend to not charge for a res in the same zone. Now, when it's the Dalnir example, I'll just say &quot;No&quot; rather than name a price.  When I do get the occassional rude response, I ask them how the recently departed would feel if their healer just took off for an hour to go assist another party...<br />

<br />
Hmmmm, I thought Oscar Wilde was gay.  You sure it was a woman he asked?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">09-11-2000, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note on this subject:<br />
<br />
Was charged 300pp after my best friend (a druid) got killed 3 times trying to drag my body to the dead side lower Guk zone.<br />
<br />
Told him to stuff it.  (This was as my bard, she got killed trying to help my druid friend get a chryso talisman)  I even sent him a tell saying who I was.<br />
<br />
He is now a higher level than Salina, even.  But he won't ever get a rez from me.<br />

<br />
Well...I know the quote is kind of off topic, but since others have mentioned it...<br />
<br />
I believe that this anecdote was about Winston Churchill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sphynkl</div><div class="date">09-13-2000, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was me you're talking about Salina and you failed to mention the following:<br />
<br />
I was asked to res someone (your friend) down on the live side in lower guk.  I said sure, I'll help you out. <br />
I killed the gargs near there and made my way down to the 3 live froggies.  <br />
<br />
There, I waited.  He then came near me but the 3 frogs attacked him.  I didn't want him to die again, so I began healing him.<br />
<br />
Well, he died and then they all jumped on me and then I died as well.<br />
I was pissed and I rudely replied to yours or his res request &quot;300p (or 100, can't remember), because I died&quot;<br />
<br />
I remember you telling me that you were Salina..which I then said sorry, but I was angry...<br />
I wasn't going to charge you 300p..at that point I wasn't going to try to attempt a res on the live side again.<br />
I thought I went out of my to help you guys.<br />
<br />
Sorry you feel that way.<br />

Since im crummy at getting around. If at any point they demand i res them or are in the least bit snippy i might accept money from them but ive never demanded it and i usually refuse it. <br />

I have trouble taking pleasure in someone elses misfortune but thats just me.<br />
