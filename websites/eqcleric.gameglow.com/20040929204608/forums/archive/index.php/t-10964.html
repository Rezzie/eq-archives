<br />
My guild can kill Prae when he has the sythe but the other day he had the hammer.  How do you kill him when he has the blasted hammer?! LOL<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Thats impressive....<br />
1hb too... man thats unreal.<br />
<br />
Yea I would love to have it, but I think a Pally would be better fited with it. If the pally can use some primal to get Avi up, then flip to this may be interesting.<br />
<br />
Does the weapon work the same way for a player as it does the mob that drops it ? does a PC still do damage when it procs ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mobs and PCs seem to have different rules when it comes to situations like this.<br />

In talking to the few in guild they seem to be divided.  One, a puller and secondary tank, thinks no way would he use that hammer.  The other, non 60 and non secondary tank, thinks he would.<br />
<br />
I think (pure conjecture here) that only a cleric would swing a weapon in hopes to have it proc invuln and render then unable to melee.  Of course I want it for the 15str/wis and 100hp/mana personally, the effect is just for giggles.</div></div><hr />
