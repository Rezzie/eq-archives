<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crispus</div><div class="date">04-04-2001, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay.  Um, don't look like people posted here.  So I might as well.  Well for beginners I'm a freshly made, out of the plastic wrapping, Erudite Cleric.  Now I traveled to Toxullia(sp?) Forest, which I think is their newbie zone area, and those creatures are hard.  So I said to myself, Crispus let's head to greener pastures ... so I took that excrusciating ride to Qeynos.  Now being a follower of Prexus I still get seasick, heh.  But anyway, I made dry land and went to the newbie zone.  Now I'm gonna tell you what I did, though you can do differently.<br />
<br />
I did the FedEx quest for the Antonican Bards until I dinged 2.  Only because I had poo-poo for HP and MANA and wanted at least a fighting chance out there.  And hey I made a few copper.  So now I pound on gnolls, snakes, rats and bats with 3 AC, buffed by courage ... my snazzy tunic got lost when I died ... long story.  But I'm gonna be slowly making my way up to level 4.  Keep ya posted on some ideas of mine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ismena</div><div class="date">07-01-2001, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with doing quests to level (and there are some that are very good for that) is that you're not developing your melee and casting skills at the same time.  You will see a HUGE difference in how fast you can kill a rat with 1HB at (1) versus  (10).  Your spells fizzle constantly when your Evocation (for example) is low as opposed to having it maxed.<br />
<br />
As for items for newbie clerics: use your first couple of gold to buy that nuke, then when you have six gold, get a backpack.  Now you're able to stay in the field twice as long.  Fire beetle eyes don't stack, you know.  Next get cloth armor; yes, it's horrible AC but even the little piddly points that it provides add up.  Someone gave me two plat when I was brand new (PLEASE don't ever /shout to the zone, &quot;I'm a newbie gimme money&quot;) and I bought as much cloth as I could.<br />
<br />
Next buy more backpacks and the rest of your spells.  Yes, your weapon stinks but you will always have horrible weapons to fight with, and our melee skills all top off too low to be useful at higher levels.  Use your nuke to fight as much as your weapon.  Keep your 2HB skill trained as well.  If you find a mob with a two-hand staff, keep the staff and use it.  Sometimes you will see someone auction, &quot;first newbie to /poke me at the gate gets a [fill in improved item here].&quot;  Run as fast as you can to the gate. There are always such offers going on at Freeport, one of many good reasons for starting there.</div></div><hr />

If you're in qeynos, save those bonechips up, one of the paladin in south qeynos offer a quest you can do by combine 6 bone chips. Good faction.</div></div><hr />
