 What's working, what are you dropping server side? What must you keep going in large raids&gt;?<br />
 Totally turning off spell animations...no sparkles? Good?<br />
 At what personnel density is this most needed? 12+ ?  18+ ? 24+ ?<br />
<br />
  List in order what you actually input into the text box and whay you can automatically edit out via check boxes server side.<br />
 When and where that is a good thing.<br />
 When does server side filtering actually interupt or prevent benificial updates from occuring?<br />
 If you block bard song effects do you actually gain the benifits of let's say mana song or replentishment?<br />
 Where is this best used?<br />
 What problem zones are now doable by more people?<br />
 WHat PING and packet loss savings are you experiencing?<br />
 And Finally we need a primer for Clerics that may not be TECH oriented. Basically a step by step procedure for RAID settings for a CLERIC.<br />
 And one for tanks...maybe just a NOte with a BOLD cap C next to it for clerics in a raid as mandatory info, and fluff, and then Unecessary DRIVEL that may drive you LD&gt;!!<br />
<br />
 DOWN WITH THE LAG MONSTER!!!!<br />
<br />
-insert my normal wit and phraseology here, as you know which is funniest to you. ;P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">03-30-2001, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't been on a raid yet since the changes but I have had server filtering turned on the last few sessions.<br />
<br />
Basically I filter just about everything, all hits/misses, bard songs, everything except spell casting so I can time stuns to interrupt.  I always have.  Yes, bard songs still work if you do.<br />
<br />
I haven't noticed anything weird about having the server side filtering turned on yet.  One thing I did notice after the patch was a little delay when using /assist I hadn't noticed before.<br />
<br />
You turn on filtering with this command:<br />
<br />
/serverfilter on<br />
<br />
There's other things that Verant has added that you can turn on/off, to assist with lag:<br />
<br />
/dyna off (dynmaic lighting)<br />
/reverb off (sound effects)<br />
<br />
Some people claim turning off PC and NPC names, turning off sky, turning off all spell effects, is good in extremely lagging situations (Fear).<br />
<br />
It seems like the most important change folks have made is increasing their datarate from the default of 5 up to at least 9.0.  I have mine at 20.0 and haven't gone LD on a raid since.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Havusin</div><div class="date">03-30-2001, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and where is the datarate information changed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">03-30-2001, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To change your datarate:<br />
click start<br />
click run<br />
enter &quot;notepad c:\progra~1\everquest\datarate.txt&quot;<br />
change the 5.0 to 7.0 to 9.0 (or higher if you want--Verant has said above 9.0 is bad in some way, tho some people put it at 40.0)<br />
ALT+F<br />
S<br />
ALT+F<br />
X<br />
<br />
I run mine at 8.0.<br />
<br />
As far as settings, I think it's in flux now.  Prior to server side filters, my standard procedure:<br />
<br />
Before logging in for the raid night, I go into my eqclient and change the following: (notepad c:\progra~1\everquest\eqclient.ini)<br />
LoadVeliousArmor=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor17=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor18=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor19=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor20=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor21=FALSE<br />
LoadArmor22=FALSE<br />
ShowDynamicLights=FALSE<br />
<br />
I have a nosound.old file I'd rename to nosound.txt. (The file just says 'delete me' inside)  Having a file called nosound.txt in your EQ directory will disable all sound.  Alternately you can /reverb off and/or turn sound settings way down.<br />
<br />
In the game itself under chat filters:<br />
Turn Other Hits to OFF (always off raid or not)<br />
Turn PC Spells to GRP<br />
Turn NPC Spells to OFF<br />
Turn Bard Songs to ME (always ME raid or not--it would be OFF but I have a bard for an errand boy)<br />
<br />
Under display settings:<br />
Particle Density to OFF<br />
3D Sky to OFF<br />
PC Names to OFF<br />
Clipping Plane all the way down and one increment inward.<br />
<br />
As you can see, my video card is the biggest bottleneck.  It's only a pci viper 550 (running on a P3 500).<br />
<br />
When the raid is done:<br />
<br />
Change PC spells to ALL<br />
Change NPC spells to ON<br />
Change particle density to LOW<br />
Change 3d sky to SINGLE LAYER<br />
Change PC names to ON<br />
Put clipping plane back to 40-50%<br />
<br />
and before I shut down my PC, I'd edit eqclient.ini and turn velious armor back on.  Turn dynamiclights back on.  rename nosound.txt to nosound.old.<br />
<br />
datarate I always keep at 8.0.<br />
<br />
My current raid setup is now:<br />
<br />
Leave the files alone in my EQ directory.<br />
<br />
In chat filters:<br />
Change PC Spells to GRP<br />
Change NPC Spells to OFF<br />
<br />
In display settings:<br />
Change PC Names to OFF<br />
Pull clipping plane to 20-30%<br />
<br />
In-game commands:<br />
/showspelleffects off<br />
/reverb off<br />
<br />
And I have far better performance than I did turning off absolutely everything before.  This patch was amazing.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">04-01-2001, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thought I'd mention, you can turn the dynamic lighting on/off at the command line.<br />
<br />
/dyna off<br />
/dyna on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nige Willowleaf</div><div class="date">04-04-2001, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">since server side filters I have not gone link dead on a dragon level encounter.<br />
<br />
I have left particles on low and turned off /ooc and /shout<br />
<br />
I have /showspelleffects off<br />
<br />
clipping about 1/3<br />
<br />
left dynamic lighting on since I am human.<br />
<br />
in Sebilis I hide corpses.<br />
<br />
BTW I am connected at 26,400 on a modem. I have 32 mg vid card and 128 ram.<br />
<br />
I used to go linkdead for every major encounter. It was like a joke in my guild  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
