</FONT><HR>The problem is the same as what used to happen to druids. They were fun to twink, easy to level, and you could solo them to high levels relitivly easily. Now, people are dropping there druid twinks and making monks. This is why druids are one of the hated classes. Even the good, decent ones get denied groups because of the bad experiences the leader/group members had.<P>Zylabik Swiftfists<BR>Monk of the 30th boot to the head<BR>Rathe server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I might as well throw my two cents in. My bio... 54 epic monk, 1100+ ac/2200hp without buffs. Probably because monks and clerics are posting to this thread they have not mentioned the biggest difference between warriors and monks as MA. Defensive /disc. A monk cannot effectively tank an encounter that requires the defensive /disc. Period. Any other encounter, a well equipped monk can MA as well if not better than a warrior.<P>Point 1: A monk should NEVER just FD as soon as he gets the pull back to the group. By dropping himself off the hate list, the mob will then aggro on the closest toon, unless someone in aggro range is sitting. A monk SHOULD stop just passed the warrior and turn to face the mob allowing the warrior to start building aggro from behind. After X number of seconds the monk can attack off and swap aggro over to the warrior.<P>Point 2: To the person who will always take a ranger over a monk... I will assume you are speaking about grouping in the uber dangerous outdoor zones where you can single pull to your hearts content. I hear OT can be a dangerous place. Take your monkless group into Chardok and let your ranger pull in there. Tell me how long it took for you to wipeout. I wont even talk about the difference in damage output.<P>Point 3: Dont knock the class because the player is incompetent. I have met bad players driving every class of toon in the game, including clerics.<P>Point 4: The level of the encounter makes a big difference when deciding who can MA what. Equipment is a close second. 50+ pally with a DW bracer chain stunning can tank exceptionally well. Uses stuns to maintain aggro and lower damage taken. Epic monk doesnt need taunt. Can take and hold aggro as well if not better that a warrior. The difference of say 1000 hp is more than made up for by the superior damage avoidance/mitigation of the monk as well as higher skill caps in dodge/riposte and the block skill.<P>Point 5: If a slower is in the group, the monk is actually a better MA in non defensive encounters. Fungi+iksar regen+chloro=30+ regen per tick. On slowed mobs that are missing/dodged/blocked/riposted, monk is regening noticable damage during fight. Throw in a high end bard and the regen is insane. I have MA'd the King in Old Seb. I routinely tank mez adds when required. <P>Sykyth<BR>Disciple of Rinmark<BR>Bearer of the Tynn<BR>Master of the Celestial Fists<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>---I used to post here (3 months ago) in regard to my Cleric, who was always an alt to my real class, which is a Monk. I've been a Monk since beta, so my brain, with regard to EQ, is simply wired to be.. monkly.<P>---Yes, a whole LOT of Monks are ignorant. That's so of any class, though. I've met more ignorant Druids than anything else. Monks are ignorant for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that a LOT of them are alts. I don't know what I know because I'm magically smarter than everyone else.

</FONT><HR>Karnors Castle, that says it all. Of course most monks are just fine. For some reason though you just don't find the good ones at KC, the bad monks all seem to gravitate there for some reason. We had two mobs in the captain room, monk goes out and brings four more, he couldnt figure out why we disbanded after the rezzes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>some of you people really have no clue still after being 50+.<BR>Xiaolone 60 Human monk<BR>Noha 57 DE cleric<BR>Monks can tank just fine in plenty of xp group situations. But only one melee should be taking the damage for the healing to be efficent. Pulling a mob then FD at the group can result in casters getting pounded to within a silver of death. Some warriors arnt to bright and even after explaing to them that a well placed arrow or where to stand to grab a FD mob they just dont get it. in those cases running the mob back to group and standing there and letting it beat the monk till the warrior has aggro works just fine. CH on a monk with 4000 hps really isnt a waste of mana either. <p>[This message has been edited by Garalon (edited 04-12-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>hmmmm I was reading throught that monk thread and something I found interesting was that monks seem to be getting up into the same AC range ac warriors, and HPs are near the same. I didn't know this, but now I do so my perception of monks might change a bit <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> I was just so used to monks getting hit and seeing their HP bar drop like mad. I was always under the impresion that their are 2 kinda of AC, straight up ac from big armours and AC from things like agility which don't count under certain circumstances like getting whacked on from behind. This is what I was told a long time ago and it could be dreadfully wrong.<P>But it is still ideal to have only 1 person in the group taking damage and the simple fact is that warriors have that taunt button and monks don't. When the chanter gets agro the warrior is gonna get it off alot quicker than a monk will.<P>Now I am also curious as to how monks are even coming close to warriors in AC? I saw a few posts on that thread saying warriors are now useless in exp groups because monks can do a better job. This doesn't seem right to me. A monk should be able to avoid damage better than anyone, but when they get hit they shouldn't be able to suck it up as well as a warrior. Otherwise why even have a warrior at all except on raids?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Not all monks are equal. Some monks are better tanks than warriors.  Some aren't.<P>As much as I am accustomed to having a warrior for a main tank, if a monk has sufficient AC and HP, I'm quite happy with a monk playing tank (as long as the other melees don't get macho and suck up aggro).  I'm even happier if they are okay with using Mend freely.  I'm always in a good mood when a monk uses Mend.  <P>Most of the monks I've grouped with - particularly in Karnor's Castle - have equal (if not better) AC and HP than the warriors I've grouped with.  And most of those monks end up out-damaging and thus out-taunting the warriors, anyway.  So either because of their stats or their ability to hold the mob's attention, I think they're better suited to being the main tank.  If the warrior isn't up to par and the monk wants to take a beating, that's cool. Complete Healing a monk makes me feel kind of odd, but again, if they've got enough HP to warrant being the main tank and can stay in range long enough for a Complete Heal, why not?<P>However, if I'm grouped with a warrior who has better AC/HP than the monk, and the monk is pulling, I do hope the monk has some tricks for shedding aggro when the pull arrives.  A monk standing there and getting beat up while the warrior's looking useless is bad. (And no, FD instantly on arrival isn't always best to transfer aggro.  Having a monk flopped at the casters' feet before any damage is done to the mob usually ends up with a bunch of cranky, injured casters.) <P>And there are monks (and rangers, paladins, even druids and shamans!) out there with insufficient AC/HP who just refuse to believe that a group is more efficient when a person other than them is taking the damage.  It's not limited to the monk class.  <P>If you're at your wits' end because your monk is pulling, and your warrior is trying to tank, but isn't able to hold the mob's attention, talk with the group and see what suggestions they have.  It's possible your monk was better suited towards tanking than the warrior.  If not, maybe the monk wasn't aware of how different his HP/AC is from the warriors, or why you wanted the warrior taking the damage.  If all else fails, maybe you could root the mob on the warrior and let everyone know that it'll smack whoever's closest, so if they aren't the designated meat shield, they should back off a bit.<P>It's been a long time since I've grouped with a monk needing education.  Most of them have been very understanding and willing to accomodate a cleric's needs.  I guess I've been lucky.<P>------------------<BR>Vinta<BR>55th Cleric of Innoruuk (Terris-Thule)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Ok I can't resist replying to this, even though it means, "No rez for Joo Shuyung!" ROFL<P>First off, 80% of the toons in KC seem to follow the LOIO, FM, OT, DL level progression path.  They mostly suck, and granted this is particularly true if you are a monk (Although all monks have to pass through KC for their epics so some monks in there know how to play).  Is it possible you went through the same zone progression as they did since you are in KC...   The problem is, its unlikely that someone will tell a hi level cleric they suck even when they do (A bad cleric is better then no cleric, every day and twice on Sundays...)!<P>Secondly, what in the world is a cleric complaining about how a monk play's his character at all?  A cleric has to be one of the easiest class to play in the game while a (pulling) monk is probably the hardest (Can't even think what class comes close to it).  Few things scares me more then a cleric who doesn't know how to use his heal spells properly and lets our MT die (How hard can it be? altough a bad puller is pretty scary as well, hehe).  There are so many issues involved with pulling, from pathing, agro radius, respawn time, str of mobs, FD techniques etc, that if all you are complaing about is they don't drop ago most of the time or all of the time, then go back to playing in DL.  The problem is not with the monk, its with you.<P>A monk's main job is to pull.  If he does that well, everything else is just details.  Your job is to keep the MT alive, not give other classes suggestions on how to play theirs particularly when you don't have the background to do so.  Just grade them on their jobs.  Its what I do.  If a cleric keeps MT alive and is not constantly oom, then I for one am happy (If you don't have an effective healing strategy for monks who tank, learn one).<P>I try to FD mobs off me to give the MT agro as a rule (Generally its the right thing to do).  I have to tell you though, if the MT is not hi enough level that he can hold agro reasonably well I don't even bother trying to drop it.  I pull, tank, FD near end of fight to pull another.  When I hear clerics and tanks whining about dropping agro, I tell them learn how to taunt better!  Otherwise it takes to long to kill mobs and is a waste of my time because exp will most likely be slow.<P>I have nothing bad to say about Rangers.  I think they are cool.  However, if you think rangers are good pullers, go back to DL, OT, FM, LOIO, etc... Catch my drift?  There are no comparisons between monks and rangers when it comes to pulling indoors (and outdoors too if the monk is good) and if you think so you will have a eye opener in Chardok when you try and get your epic (You won't even get close to the Royals, hehe).  You best start making some monk friends now if you ever want to be able to click rez people...<P>The game changes at lvl 50 btw.  You think you know how to play a cleric.  You probably have not done large target raids with chain CH strategies.  If you have not done a number of dungeon crawls (and the team skills necessary to be successful), then you probably are not even a good lvl 50 cleric and will require a substantial amount of training before anyone lets you play a key postion on an important raid (where team skills are critical).  In many ways your still a noob.<P>There are a lot of twinks running around giving monks (and other classes for that matter) bad names, but so what.  Whenever I hear one class bashing another class its usually for the wrong reasons and because they don't appreciate what that class can do (dropping agro is not always the right call and in KC its generally optional).  All classes are good, its all on how you play them.<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

It seems the saying is true - you can teach an old cleric new tricks :><P>The only insight I have about monks (other than that some of them really do shine) is their on the whole insistance of splitting mobs because they can.

</FONT><HR>I tank better than most warriors.<P>Some warriors tank better than me.  Its MY Job to know if I'm being efficient or not.  I will choose whats best for my group, just like I pull whats best for my group.<P>A necro and shaman combo is more effective for an exp group than a cleric is, why?  They both do damage, and both recycle their own HP to make efficient mana recovery.  With a solid monk pulling somewhere like seb, its not as if you are going to need rezzes, barring massive LD-ness.<P>  Monks tank better than warriors very often in exp groups.  Just because you refuse to be efficient in healing a monk, doesn't make THEM less efficient.  It means that your healing is not efficient.<P>  Would you be happy CHing a buffed warrior with 4k hp? how about 4.5k hp ?

</FONT><HR>The problem I have with monks isn't actually healing them.  It's that most monks I've grouped with (yes, with a couple exceptions) have been overly agressive pullers, have told me what to do (wrongly, btw), have told the chanter what to do (wrongly, btw), and almost always, they run right into camp and FD on top of ME, of all people.<P>They scream for heals right after I give the message, they FD when the group's in trouble, then have to go instead of doing CR, they SAY they can single pull, and then come to camp with 5 mobs because they don't want to have to wait for them to walk off...<P>I don't group with monks if I have a choice.  I'm another one, I'll take a ranger in a heartbeat over a monk.  The couple ones that I grouped with that weren't whacked out really didn't add so much to the group that I'd miss it.  They were unexceptional, to be generous.<P>I don't like rogues, either.  Most of them are abrasive, too.  Monks and rogues are (in my experience) the worst about knowing everyone else's class in the group, and having no clue on their own.  And they whine and cry for heals... regardless of the ----==== Healing monkmoron/roguedumbbutt ====----- message that just popped up in groupsay. <P>EDIT:   Oh, and the best puller in Chardok, by far, is a well played necro.  Actually, outside of a situation that requires harmony, a properly played necro is always the best puller.  The problem is that necros who group are so rare.  Necros that group and play well are in exceedingly short supply.  But they are, hands down, the best FD pullers.<p>[This message has been edited by Amris (edited 04-17-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think Vage has a good point, though the problem comes across with different personalities.<P>As a Monk you feel you know when you are being efficient as you see your own damage, no how the monsters are affecting you and can gague off of past experience to determine if you are the most efficient tank.<P>As a Cleric I feel that I know when a tank is being efficient as I see their damage, no how the monsters are affecting them and can gague off of past experience to determine if they are the most efficient tank in the group.<P>Hmmm they seem pretty similar.  And in fact I agree that typically both cases apply.  Good players, and I stress good players, know their character, their abilities, and their weaknesses.<P>I don't have a problem with good players and in fact we don't have conflicts as in general we end up agreeing.  The problem only arises when the person is incompetent or we have differing oppinions.<P>I think many monks make very good tanks.  But this is not all of them.  Typically it requires levels, nice gear, and ability.  The post was on a bad experience, and wondering if we encounter the same.<P>I have encountered the same.  Often.  I still believe that many, if not most monks know their class well, as I can say I often find other classes that more regularly don't know how to play their characters.<P>This thread just highlights some of the issues that clerics have with certain aspects of monks.  It isn't a destroy monks they are useless, thread.  And there are problems with clerics as well.  But for crying out loud,  listing issues with another class doesn't constitute dumping on them.  Though it often errupts into such.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>This from a guy who played his first ever character to 54, then twinked a monk. <P>My monk is and has been my main for some time now. (He's epic'ed, lvl 60, AA points, yadda yadda)<P>This post was about an exp pickup group. Depending on where you are grouped, your monk may require heals after pulling, if pulling casters, he's sure to take damage on the way back. As stated in this thread, dumb players are mana sponges. <P>Any thread of this sort on a class board that gets more than one post in agreement is sure to bring the attacked class running. One thing that I have seen in this thread is that clerics need to understand a little more about monks in the 55+ game. Not only from what Ive read, but what I exp everday in game. I've had 2 TWO! clerics CH me without having to let them know that with 3800+hp buffed anything below half health is more efficient with a CH.<P>I'm a damn fine cleric and a decent monk. =) but to come here and see all these clerics showing thier ignorance as to the way the game has changed is an eye opener. The cleric that said to try a higher end zone without a cleric, lmao do it all the time. With a 60 sham slowing, lol who takes damage? <P>Now monks, a few have made comments to clerics about the ease of thier jobs. I will admit that in MANY of the exp grinds a cleric doesnt seem to do much after ageo'ing everyone. lol Rest assured tho they earn all of thier money when raiding or in a seat-of-your-pants mob encounter.  Clerics make sure we know your nuking in those easy groups so we can tell your doing something other than CE'ing us every other pull. =)<P>Also clerics, if while pulling I take a substatial amount of damage, I know that I'm close to making a CH more efficient. I'll often tank the mob while I take damage down to 1 bub before FD'ing. This is a benifit to the group as you were going to spend that mana on me anyway. Now I'm full health and ready for the next pull, plus you get no healing agro with me fd'ed.<P>And...since I'm more a monk than a cleric... and this started as a slam on monks, I'll end with this. I've seen far more poorly played clerics than I have monks. (and yes, I know, clerics are harder to play.)  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008334-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008334.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008334&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008334&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
