The treants in South Karana are excellent experience (and good cash) for dark elf clerics or anyone else that does not care if they are KOS in Qeynos or not =) Your group will also be able to take down the wandering cyclops and avocet.<br />
<br />
If you are ever planning on doing the Testament of Vanear quest, do NOT kill treants until you finish getting the container and page from Moodoro.<br />

Anywhere you see Jaggedpine treefolk.  Be especially sure that you do not get a teleport from a Druid to North Karana (I was lucky enough to run far enough away that I could get my body back unmolsted).  You can raise your faction with the Guards of Qeynos by hunting in Splitpaw which is usually unhunted (I think the max number of people I saw was 6 in this zone).  Once you get your faction up high enough, you can hunt BB to raise your faction with the Jaggedpine Treefolk again, but this will take a good bit of time to do I think.  I saw Holly in Qeynos hills, and while she was deep blue, she was still treatening.  And this was after hunting for about 3-4 hours in BB killing all of the Gnolls I could.  You also need to be careful of Druids in your group.  Should they happen to need to evac your party from a tight situation, make sure it isn't to N. Karana, or you will be in worse shape, or as I had happen to me one day, it was decided that we were going to new hunting grounds, and the druid started the teleport before anyone could make me invisible so that I would survive the teleport.  Luckily, I backed far enough away that I didn't teleport also.<br />
<br />
Just some things to think about should you decide to do this.  And the loot is GREAT there.  Lots of plat, gold, and silver, and sometimes Great Staffs which sell to vendors for around 12pp a piece.<br />

I get 3 bubbles of Xp a night and 75-125plat a night depending upon how the loot goes. I am Dark Elf and as far as i can remember i have been KoS in the Karanas anyway.<br />
<br />
If you are a DE, get busy starting your own lumber company. heh. you can also do it much lower than 24 as a cleric. from level 20-21 you will be just a buffer and healer. at 22 your Smite and fear spells are resisted alot less and you can once again be an effective caster. At 24 everything there should be yellow or lower (at 22 everything is yellow and red).<br />
<br />
Be very mindful of the Cyclops that you attack as a group. my group tried one last night and only two of us survived. usually when we fight Cyclops it is not a problem. the one we got must have been highest it can be in level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Go to where the MOBs you must kill to raise faction are.  Mem up light heal. Cast a tiny leeetle heal on anyone you see fighting a MOB that will raise your faction.  Are you following me?  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif Yes that's right anytime we heal someone during a battle we join in on whatever faction results from that.  That's why you never try and heal your DE friend getting whaled on by the guards.. haha.  So, in this case.. yo kill treants you would just go to BB and toss heals on all the dozens of newbies killing scrawnys and whatnot and you are golden. Mass faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">laetatus</div><div class="date">10-29-1999, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">remember that after lvl 30 or so...its time to go work on your faction for qeynos.<br />
As a dwarf cleric..<br />
<br />
I was mad when I had to get to a bank and was 180/106 hehe..had to much money. even after i deleted all the silver and cp. So I got a sow and str buff, and snailed me way to highpass hold..And yikes I was KOS..Will I dont know what I killed that gave me such a bad faction. But I had to spend a week of killing boring raiders and gnolls to get to dubiously. So remember to con everything and work on you faction like you daddy told ya to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walterscott</div><div class="date">11-01-1999, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So not only you KOS to Qeynos guards, but to HHPass guards if you kill Treants???<br />

Treants are 'good' and highpass guards are considered corrupt.  This is good because Highpass is one of the few places I can bank.<br />

I say @#@@#% qeynos faction now..there is nothing there i will ever need or cant get form another...I would like to be an EVIL DWARVEN CLERIC...so It dont bother me much to be KOS to afew stinky guards or druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I heard that you can go from KOS to friendly by giving him 250 muffins. =)</div></div><hr />

It'll train the heck out of the place (warning the zone that you're about to do this would be a good thing) and then back to where you are close to the zone (just in case, but if you're hunting treants you shouldn't worry) and then aoe the heck out of them.  They won't be able to hit you and you'll end up killing most of them off, and the rest will flee and get maimed by all the little guys.<br />
<br />
BTW, made over 1400pp from killing treants between 20 and 24.5, so it can be VERY profitable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Advert</div><div class="date">03-27-2000, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats funny...Killing treants give u bad fraction ?, I spent 2h yesterday killing treants in a group and didn't even get one fraction change with anything, I used smite once on them and chain healed the rest of he time.. I know that I was on the treant agro list because every time they got near me they started to hit me.<br />
later I went to the druids in NK (I think it was NK) and lost fraction so there wasn't anything wrong with my filter-settings.<br />
(I hate losing fraction but the exp and loot sometimes is to great to ignore...especialy when u hit a spell lev and need plat for your spells)<br />
