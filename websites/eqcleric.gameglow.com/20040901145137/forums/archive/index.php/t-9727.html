<br />
I'm sorry to say but new servers aren't going to do much at all. 80% of EQ players have a character on a Server and they don't wanna have to start over. Why you ask?? because apparently Verant hates low lvl characters and they make sure they can get picked off like a dog by any wandering NPC around any corner. I've been fiddling with a bard, and on my way to lvl 8 I've seen 3 count them 3 rare spawns walk by me and pick me off like a dog, how I wish I was on my with my cleric.<br />
<br />
But anyway, back to the point. Without the Ability to move an already formed character to a different server, &quot;NEW SERVERS!!!&quot; aren't going to do anything, but give New EQ players a nice place to go, if they realize that before they say, &quot;Hey, that server has alot of players. It must be popular =(&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgrim</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that a character is just a set of tables in a database on one server, it should be fairly simple to move characters from one server to another, IN PRINCIPAL.  However, this is probably not something that Verant would want to automate, and here's why.<br />
<br />
Imagine 6000 people on YOUR server, all at once.<br />
<br />
As a lark, people would participate in mass-migrations from one server to another, flooding and probably crashing the server.  Or perhaps people will get wind of a special event happening on one server, and several thousand people will flood that server for the event.  Still no good.  Yet another thing:  distribution of items.  What happens when those ultra-rare (or unique, one-per-server) items all get bunched up on one server?<br />
<br />
Additionally, Verant will not be inclined (I would suspect) to implement a policy of manually moving characters from one server to another (except possibly in the most DIRE of situations, although I couldn't fathom what that situation would entail).  Even if there were such a policy in place to move on request, there is too much customer support interfacing that needs to go on.  You think there aren't enough GM's now?  It was bad enough before we had the /surname command, when people were waiting DAYS for an available GM to com give them their name at level 20.  Perhaps a one-time per character (or per account) move policy might satisfy a large number of people.. For instance I started my character on Tarew Marr, and I knew only one other player in the game, and she was on TM, and that's why I created it there.  Of course, she was level 20 or so when I started, and she's never going to be able to group with me (unless we both hit 50) because of that split in levels.  Then I talk with some friends out of town and find out they started playing last month, on a different server.  If I start a new character, I have the same problem, a split in levels, and vice-versa.  But my level 16 cleric would be able to jump shards, and start grouping immediately with their level 14-15 characters.<br />
<br />
I think it would be great to not only handle those cases, but also for &quot;de-crowding&quot; some of the older servers.<br />
<br />
How about this?  What if Verant offered to take ~100 volunteers off of 10 different servers and put them on a brand new server?  In actuality, they would probably take about 3000 people, I suppose that there are roughly that many total per server, with only half of those active at any given time (roughly).  They could do it during a scheduled downtime, and next time you log in, your character is on the new server.  I think this would be a GREAT way to spread some of the traffic from the more populated servers to the newer ones.  I also think they should close quite a few of the servers, so that people can't create new characters any more... to stop already crowded, but popular servers from getting worse.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I have a slightly naive view....  Certainly there are some valid comments, though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emerld</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree.  Look at the trend so far.  The instant a new server opens up, people flock to it, discarding their old characters in the process.  Why?<br />
<br />
So they can powerlevel like mad and thus not have to compete for the nice spawn points and such in the game.<br />
<br />
You would have no problem getting the cleric armor if you're level 35 and everyone else is level 15, right?  Noone to compete against.  If you're one of the few high levels out there, the world is your oyster.<br />
<br />
The problem is, if they add a server and it fills up, that's 1500 people at peak times less on the other servers.  Divide out and the result is less than 100 less people per server.  Think we'll notice they've left?<br />
<br />
They'd have to add 5 or 10 new servers to really ease the burden, and they're not going to do that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgrim</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah yes, Emerld, but don't overlook the fact that people are also joining and quitting EQ every day, most likely more join than quit.  Those that are joining are not necessarily joining the newest server.  So the addition of new servers doesn't solve the problem immediately.  I doubt there are really lots of high-level players that are willing to abandon the characters they've fostered for months, just for a chance to powerlevel a new character so they can camp all the good items they weren't able to get on their current server.  I'd be more willing to believe that most of those people are level 15 or lower, and that none of them totally abandons any of their characters.  I personally play about 7 or 8 characters on 4 different servers, including one that I started on Tribunal right after it was added.  But I haven't stopped playing my other characters, nor have I powerleveled my character on the new server.<br />
<br />
I agree that adding 5 or 10 new servers at once, though not bloody likely, might reduce some of the congestion on the existing servers, but I doubt it would be as noticeable as you think.  It WOULD be noticeable, however, if people could take their characters with them.<br />
<br />
The real problem (and I suppose I contribute) is the people that play on multiple servers.  I don't add to the traffic of just one server, I might be on one of several at any given time.  Sure I can still only be on ONE at a time, but the fact that I maintain characters on those 4 different servers means that I MIGHT go back to any one at any time.  However, if I could pick one server and put all my characters there, I create traffic on ONE and only one server, ever.  There has got to be a certain percentage of each server that is made up of people like me, that, once cleared away and consolidated to one server, would remove some of the people on a server.  Maybe just not enough to make a difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kanlee</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New servers definately work! Within a week or 2, the new ones are up to the same load as the older ones, 1400-1600 during peak hours. If that new server wasn't there, that's 1400 or so people spread out on the other servers. A couple more right now would be nice. They would be used.<br />
<br />
People on old servers start characters on new servers because they're fresh, and they have a chance to be among the first high levels.<br />
<br />
New players will be more likely to join the least crowded server, which will most likely be the newest one.<br />
<br />
And I don't really like the idea of moving a character from an old server to a new one. This would completely destroy a fresh econemy, the people starting from scratch would be left behind by high levels from another server. The only way this would work is if the cash and equipment were deleted during the transition.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgrim</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good points, Kanlee.  Although it is easy to argue that the NPC economy is so worthless and static that any items that would port over from one server to another would only affect the player economy.... which is exactly what is going to happen with the power gamer types that will powerlevel and begin farming the good items anyway.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, what you're really saying is that a new server is a fresh opportunity for a new group of elite item farmers to spring up, the ones that were just a little too late to get control on an older server.  Either way, the economy system in EQ is so bad that it can't account for it.  Arguing damage to the economy (which is already broken, in my book), even the player-driven economy, is not a very valid argument when you are only going to see it damaged sooner or later.<br />
<br />
As for spreading people out, Emerld was right, as more servers are in place, each new server takes a significantly smaller share of each existing server's player load... less than 100 active players now is a good guess... and who would notice 100 fewer players on a server with 1800 players at peak time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heklar</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't think that new players will just run to the server with the least people.<br />
<br />
I think quite a few new people are brought to the game by Real Life Friends of their's playing the game. Are they going to goto a new server, I don't think so. They're going to play on the same server as their friend.<br />
<br />
Next I've found new servers to be like a fad. Like when Tallon Zek opened, WHAM 4000+ people then even when they brought around Vallon Zek there were 2200+ per server, but look at them now, mabye 1000 players. People flock to new servers, find out it's just as crappy as the other one they have a higher lvl char on and they go back.<br />
<br />
I honestly think some manner of moving a character to a different server would help even things out alot more, but I'm really not sure on a good way you'd handle that. Like mentioned before, Leave it in the hands of the players and you'll have migrating players all over, leave it in the hands of Verant and we're all screwed anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Opheliany</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People, some of you show wisdom, but others talk just before they start thinking...  First, everyone seems to agree that most of the servers are too crowded at peak times, including the most recent ones.  This means people play on those servers.  The Tallon Zek / Vallon Zek situation is different, as those are PvP.  Many players don't like PvP and it's ok, that's the only reason why those servers aren't filled right now.  Are new servers actually helping to cut some crowding in older ones?  Only one answer possible: yes.  Not that you can actually see the difference it makes, or that you could count exactly how many should have left...  The point is, many new servers have been brought up since June, but all servers are still crowded...  why?<br />
I don't like crowded servers and I mostly don't play at eak hours cause it gets so boring just about everywhere you can go (not true, some zones are always quiet, but there are reasons for that, danger, too far from city, trains madplace...).  Does this mean that there is more room on the server?  Yes, cause me and many others aren't playing.  But wait, Verant put one or two servers up, cleans some of the crowd from my server and I decide to go play again now.  Still, it's not perfect, but playable.  So I wasn't playing at peak times and now I am, meaning I cause crowdness again.  Of course the situation is better, but not as much as someone could hope it to be.  <br />
Is the idea of adding more servers a good one?  Yes!  Butdon't expect one or two servers to make some big changes, nor would 10-15, cause there isn't that many people ready to drop their character simply to have a chance on playing on a new, fresh, server.  <br />
Moving character from server to another is also a dream of many.  It could be done easily I think, but it would also ruin just about every server there is.  The point of a new server is to offer a chance to play in a less crowded space and to reset the economy.  The first point is simple, but the second needs some EQ playing to understand.  You hear a lot about the ruined economy in this game and it is true.  The economy of EQ is suffering from a bad case of  mad inflation.  There simply is too much money entering the game and not enough taken out.  Many monster you kill gives money, others give loots that you can always sell at a fixed price.  That's great, but so unrealistic that it creates an overflow of cash.  This cash This overflow will then be used to devellop and ruin the trading skill part of the game, by allowing many players to get better at their skill way too easily, and then sell at large the stuff they can make.  I've played on Bertoxx for many months now, and never would I have hoped in July to get a full set of small bronze for 150pp (or 100pp), now, it isn't that hard to get.  But wait, I was talking of inflation right? not deflation...  Right, but in the case of the stuff you pick up, you are stuck with the same effect you had with money.  Too many bronze armor items are entering the game, and people that actually used it a while are selling it now that they have something better.  A lot of bronze out there, and not as many newbies as there were couple of months ago, meaning that to sell your bronze, you need to lower the price...<br />
But that seems cool!  Having a full bronze set at lvl 10 is actually quite outstanding!  You can attack just about everything and get out of the fight alive.  Wich mean you can level faster!  Great, but really it's sad when you think I never used a single item (except maybe beteen lvl 1-4) that I picked up myself of some creature I killed.  Everything I have as been bought... Anyway, if I have the 10pp at lvl 8 to buy an RTS, why wait to lvl 15 to get one?<br />
The point is, if you get characters from a server to another, this character will bring his equipment and, at least, his trading skill ability, with wich he'll be able to flood the world of marvelous jewels or banded armor...  Verant dosen't want that, and I agree.<br />
<br />
I hope I haven't killed anyone with that long post...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgrim</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the state of the economy:<br />
<br />
There are NO economics built into the game's code, other than 2 simple mechanisms:<br />
<br />
1) a supply of &quot;free&quot; money and items gotten as a result of killing mobs (to a lesser degree this includes completing quests).<br />
<br />
2) a &quot;sink&quot; whereby the money and items from #1 are destroyed or removed from the game, usually at a STEEP loss.<br />
<br />
The &quot;sink&quot; is basically just the merchants (or any NPC to whom you would give items or money for any reason).  You give the merchant some coins, you get an item.  You give the merchant an item, you get a few coins, but SUBSTANTIALLY LESS than you would have paid for the same item.  This is Verant's way of removing a glut of items and currency from the world.  It is not, however, an &quot;economy.&quot;<br />
<br />
An economy depends on supply and demand (yes, we all remember this from our 4th grade social studies class, so I won't get into the specifics of it).  If you sell 1000 bat wings to a merchant, all at one time, the first one is worth 8cp, and the last one is worth 8cp.  In anything REASONABLY approximating an economy, the average price in that transaction would be considerably lower (as we all know, buying in bulk gives you leverage in setting the price -- part of the wonderful system of supply and demand).  Until the game is altered so that some merchants will have so many bat wings on their hands they just won't take them any more, and still others need them so badly they'll sell their firstborn for them, there's no economy to speak of.<br />
<br />
Of course, there are very good reasons for doing this.  It stops the newbie zone merchants from cutting off the income of the new characters... who would want to sell in a newbie zone where 60-odd players are ALL selling rat ears for next to nothing?  Another reason is that, unlike the real world, the computer can be manipulated.  What would stop hundreds of people consorting outside the game to flood one merchant in order to drive down prices, or drive up demand with other merchants to maximize player profits?  You can't do this in real life because people will adjust to the situation, people won't have a nearly limitless supply of items to sell and merchants won't have a limitless supply of cash to buy them.<br />
<br />
What's the point of this?  The point is that the only TRUE economy in the game is player driven one, and it's already faulty before a single player is on the server.  It's predicated on the fact that the first person to obtain an item of inherent value sets the price.  This is because the individual or group that first controls the spawn the item comes from, they can maintain that control for a considerable time, possibly indefinitely.  There are rampant tales of guilds and some unsavory people farming (raping is a better word) rare items for profit.  Let's face it, some of the items on some of the older servers are practically COMMON now, they've been collected so much, but the prices are artificially inflated.  This is because the source is controlled by a small minority of players.  The ones that have acquired the items (by questing or buying) are not to blame, they have theirs, and that's the only one they care about.  But there are those that have gotten dozens or hundreds of a particular item, and THEY control the price because they are the only sellers in the market.<br />
<br />
A new server is a race to control these spawns and items.  The first to reach high enough levels and start obtaining these items are not the people that are interested in obtaining one and moving on, they are the ones that have deliberately worked to get there, so they can STAY there, and control a niche in the market.  The person or group that could get to the Jboots first, for instance, could stay there for quite some time; no yield rule to drive them off, and until someone bigger comes along (and no one is bigger, or else they would have gotten there first), they are kings of all they survey... and you'll pay a ridiculous price if you want what they have badly enough.  Until Verant does the only other thing possible... change the mob's drop table, and shuffle that item off somewhere else, more difficult to manage.<br />
<br />
The point of my argument is that arguing damage to the economy is an impotent claim.  Enough of a mix of people would be willing to switch servers that the higher level players would more than likely already have their items, and lower level players would not be threatened.  Of course, the low-class element would be present always; there will always be those that have to monopolize something of value and charge a high price for a piece of the action, so what matter if it comes in the form of someone that power-levels to do it, or simply moves their level 50 wizzie over from Cazic-Thule server to do it?<br />
<br />
The only real argument to be made is capping a server.  From what I've seen, daytime usage is in the 400-700 range across all servers, and peak evening times are 1300-1900 across the boards.  Verant stated from the outset that optimum is 1000 per server.  My question: what went wrong?  I recently read on the alt.games.everquest group a post from Brad McQuaid that each server has roughly 5000 player accounts (not characters), but due to peoples' schedules and such, only 1/3 of them are ever expected to be on at one time, which is why you never see 5000 at a time.  Of course, the few occasions (holidays, etc.) when it's possible for more than the usual number to be online is what has me worried.  Nothing could be a worse PR nightmare than soothing 3000 EQ weenies home for the holidays, pissed because too many people online brought down their server.  You can't tell people that they can't play right now, try again later... <br />
<br />
If you took the maximum number of people that could *reasonably* be on a server at one time, added an additional 250-500 to that, and capped the server, I think it would be ideal.  It would probably call for twice as many servers as there are now, which is why it won't happen.  I look at it this way:  they are trying to minimize their maintenance cost, and I understand that, but the computers are not costing THAT much.  So what if some servers are almost empty on off-peak hours, and barely at half capacity at peak hours?  Happier customers, fewer crashes and less emergency maintenance are the benefits.  They don't need to worry about staffing to handle networking crises due to overutilization.  They won't be able to blame CERFNET for problems any more... with proper planning of the network segments they can avoid over-taxing their pipeline.  Sure, they have twice as many servers to maintain software on, and twice as many hardware components to fail, but even those can be managed, and with hot backups and RAID for disks, and backups for other fault-prone hardware in stock, a hardware failure shouldn't be a major catasrophe.<br />
<br />
Even still, THAT won't help the situation, because people won't willingly abandon their hard-fought-for characters on the older servers, and new players aren't automatically going to jump on the server with the lowest population.  Moving characters from one server to another is the only solution to evening out the population, and even THEN, new people will still be joining, and adding to the population in an uneven manner.<br />
<br />
It's depressing to belabor this debate to this point, but I'm bored... =)  Everyone has great arguments, and all of those arguments are destroyed by the simple fact that Verant has no vested interest in giving us anything beyond the minimum possible expenditure that will maintain their income.  If they can squeeze and extra 3000 players into the existing servers, that's money they DON'T have to spend on another server.  When things get really bad, they'll do it, but not a moment sooner.<br />
<br />
After all, we are talking about the people that nerf character abilities and tell us they've &quot;finally fixed them.&quot;<br />

At level 19, for instance, it is a simple matter to twink your friends to 15-16 when they can start grouping with you for xp.<br />
How easy is it to level with a cleric?  Think about having a cleric next to you, casting daring and healing spells on you.  You can go virtually non-stop to 8.  After 8, you go to bigger places, and you do occasionally have to med.  If your friends are only in the mid-teens invite them to your server and tell them you'll twink them up.  I helped a friend of mine go from 2 to 16 in about 48 hours- and that was with him looting and occasionally selling it off.  If they are your friends from RL it's definitely worth your while.<br />
<br />
It's about the one redeeming facet of clerics in my mind.  At 19 our hp buffs (if you're willing to spend 2gp on a buddy for Symbol of Transaal and have daring- you're looking at adding serious hp to them)  And your heals will make their hp effectively infinite.  It's almost stupid.  6th level characters taking out LFD bandits....  After all, you dont have to be grouped to cast heal on someone...<br />
<br />
me: &quot;So, how much did you get for that?&quot;<br />
him: &quot;OMG.. a bubble and a half...&quot;<br />
<br />
So, dont worry if you have friends on other servers.. just invite them to yours, and make it up to them.<br />
<br />
Admittedly this doesnt work so well at higher levels.  But I saw a 50 cleric helping out 25-30s at Unrest... can you say ressurection/resolution... think about what that does to camping unrest... *chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cadien</div><div class="date">11-20-1999, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm....well, one solultion to the problem of server crowding would be moving characters.  This has been discussed, but my idea in particular.<br />
<br />
1)for all the over-crowded servers(ie: Fennin Ro, Veeshan etc. etc. etc.) create a new server.<br />
<br />
2)Find people willing to move their characteres.  Have a quota on the number of a certain level can move(ie: only 10 level 50's can move, 20 40's etc. etc. etc.) The reason for this: when the server opens, the level distribution is evenly spread out, and you don't have people power leveling to camp items.  I'm quite sure guilds would be willing to do this for a fresh start on servers.(An alternate to this, would be move a few of the big guilds over to new servers)<br />
<br />
The way I see it, this would cut down server crowding ALOT.  The only problem with this, Verant doesn't want to spend the money that they extort out of us to make us happy(think of Brad sitting in a pile of 100 dollar bills, lighting his cuban cigar with a stack of them =)<br />
<br />
To sum up: create new servers for crowded ones, move characters of all levels over, until the number reaches 1000, or 1200.<br />
