<br />
24 hours later, Lord Feshlak, Dagarn the Destroyer, Lord Kreizenn, Lady Mirenilla, Lord Koi`Doken, Jorlleag and Lady Nevederia had also been killed for the first time by us (Second team to do this on Erollisi Marr, at least I think Magister has been this far). It sure is a rush when you fight one dragon with her two guards, and pull it off.<br />

This has been the most action filled day in EQ ever for me, as far as I can remember. NW ToV is what VP should have been. :-P</div></div><hr />

<br />
North wing is a tremendous amount of fun. The right mix of mobs to make a good raid pace, you can roll through a dozen dragons in a day and feel like you were challenged while doing it. The opposite of Sleeper's Tomb as a gaming experience.<br />
<br />
The best fights are against a dragon and their guards at the same time, lots of action and things to keep track of.<br />
<br />
Of course, Lord Vyemm plus four named drakes makes for a good laugh while you are dying...<br />

Zlexak put a bit of a damper on us, and after the second try (when he was at Zl for a few minutes but too few people were left alive to finish him) I had to go to bed. :-)</div></div><hr />

It reminds me of the days when we would simply buff up, run in, and hope that our skills and wits would see us through  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">08-27-2001, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">NToV is quite entertaining... there aren't many actually _hard_ dragons (meaning significantly harder than say Tormax or Yelinak). Really once you learn them and are equipped well enough you can 30man Ikatiar, Eashen, Aaryonar, Feshlak, Mirinella, Koi'doken, Sevalak, Cekenar, Jorlleag, Zlexak, Nevederia... but that is sort of the idea and some of these dragons are far from trivial before you learn them (Aary and Zlexak especially, Neve to some degree). Kreizenn and Dagarn aren't difficult, but do need some melee power to take out (36-42 certainly, but I doubt 30). Vyemm is the most difficult one, though it needs some brains to figure out and I'm sure it'll be a lot less fun when it's well posted where are the best places to fight it etc. Still, quad 1190 is nothing to scoff at and your agro control better be good, since him turning around a lot is something you do NOT want to see  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Still I would probably be gone for EQ had NToV not pulled me in for the final challenge. What worries me is that a lot of guilds are 'finishing' Velious too early. We've killed everything short of Ventani (might be capable, but not interested looking at what BotS got for their troubles) and Tunare and the farm rounds of ToV are getting trivial (one wipesized loss during the whole raid to a misplaced Vyemm who died within 30 minutes of the wipe). Sure the loot is godly, but such a great amount drops every clear and farming for what.. 3-4 months really isn't my idea of fun :/<br />
<br />
Those who have yet to conquer NToV, go do it now. Exploring the place is more than rewarding and unless you get freshly chewed out tactics from those that have already cleared, it'll keep you busy for quite some time as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerie</div><div class="date">08-28-2001, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">North wing ToV has a very unique feel other &quot;high end&quot; encounters simply don't offer. The pace (fast), difficulty (along with nice reward), and finding out how to kill that annoying dragon (read: Lord Vyemm and Zlexak)... compare that to CotH'ing people up to Yelinak and beating him down or clearing Fear umpteenth time for Cazic. I am a quite jaded player, but ToV North shows me that Verant can create good content aimed at raiding crowd. We can only hope Verant can create more zones with the same flavor in Luclin.<br />
<br />
I must disagree with some posters here on a point though. Vyemm is more annoying than fun...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pilsburry</div><div class="date">08-29-2001, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild will be doing nToV soon.<br />
<br />
How is it compared to say VP? VP is fairly easy these days....<br />
<br />
And if I was to load up on resists which would you say is the most important for nToV? Is it MR still? MR always sems the way to go..fire shortly behind that..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">08-30-2001, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm well. The 2 totally vital AEs for melee to resist are MR and DR. As for casters only AE I get hit with is FR (Dagarn/Kreizenn/Feshlak) and CR (Koi'doken/Feshlak). Mostly I take the AE hits because they aren't really dangerous... however as a cleric you should never be close to the more dangerous AEs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">08-31-2001, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, end game AEs seem to be falling into 2 catagories.<br />
<br />
1) Trivial, don't worry about it to much.<br />
<br />
2) Don't bother with resists, we gona hide from it.<br />
<br />
NewClericOnRaid tells you, 'What resists do I need for this?'<br />
You tell NewClericOnRaid, 'A wall, stand by me, if we get hit by the AE, we lost.'<br />
NewClericOnRaid tells you, 'Oh..'<br />
