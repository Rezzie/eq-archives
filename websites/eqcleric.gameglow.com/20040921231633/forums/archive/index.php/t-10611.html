<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naxy</div><div class="date">10-15-2001, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time to move to Frontier Mountains perhaps? Endless supply of giants and fast pulling at the gates of the giant fort. You could probably start at Lower Guk as well, but that is more for the danger seeking crowd.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

Go to the basement of the keep and look for a warrior or guard group. <br />
<br />
Very nice xp at your level if you get a good group.<br />

If you get lucky, you might find a high level cleric who is camping the king room for his/her epic.. generally they bring friends along to PL, so you might be able to join them...<br />
<br />
I do like CT though, but as you say, it can be a chore to get groups sometimes... <br />
<br />
In my low to mid 30's I moved to Tower of frozen shadow off iceclad(velious).. floor 2 of ToFS can be GREAT exp... plus its all undead.... I recommend you go to the back of the 2nd floor and pull to there... you can get singles, and its awesome exp, with the chance at some high plat loot....<br />
<br />
I like dungeon hunting, simple fact is that its better exp.... Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other areas: Paw, Sol A, Mistmoore (graveyard or outside the castle), South Karana (spires gnolls), Warrens (lots of greens, but deep in you'll find some higher), Cazic, Upper Guk, Rathe Mountains, Lesser Faydark, Iceclad (cougars near the pirate outpost).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barfadin</div><div class="date">10-19-2001, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">aight i'm at keep at the moment which is good exp. i'll probably head to kunark like a lil bit after 30 and then sol a. my question this time is what armor (like what is it called, chest?) did u guys wear right around this lvl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">10-20-2001, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get to Iceclad, skip right over them silly cougars-after level 30, the exp is MUCH better in Eastern Wastes and (especially) Crystal Caverns and ToFS. If ya can squeeze into a stalag terrors group (I got into them starting at 32), the loot is passable and the exp flows like mercury (note that mercury flows bettah than water ;P) Did ToFS from 35-45 and OMG was it insane exp-I was getting a level or more a day, including hell levels (did 35 in about 5 hours on 2nd floor). Once I hit 39 I could solo the specs on 1st floor while waiting for my usual group to show up and once I hit 44 I could solo 5th floor wedding party for a lil exp and INSANE loot-I could pull 5K worth of auction gear out in 2 hours if that stupid enraged didn't spawn-if he did, I popped divine and ran the 60 game feet to the zone mirror and came back later.<br />
<br />
As for breastplate, at 30 I think I was wearing a mithril-runed tunic, but I had more money than most from tradeskills and alot of time spent buying/selling in NFP (the auction zone on Drinal). Saw alot of bloodstained tunics, bronze, plate and even a few banded on my fellow clerics, if I remember right....<br />

<br />
I see a lot of bloodstained tunics at level 30ish now tho.<br />

I would definately suggest picking up some of that.  It looks amazing, and is really good stuff, plus it is rather common.  For arms you can't beat Ulthork Arms...  good wis and good ac.  As for shields I started with the Shiney Brass Shield from Crushbone, upgraded to Vellium Round Shield around 15 ish, and just traded off again to the amazing Clay Guardian Shield.</div></div><hr />
