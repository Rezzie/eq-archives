<br />
Assassin/Supplier room -- hey, I'd love a tbb and light burlap sack -- oops, room camped by level 50 necro and pet.  No room.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Sage room -- my good friend still needs both common and rare drops, let's try there -- oops, room camped by level 49 necro and pet.  No room.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Basically, same story as every other time I've gone to lguk.  Anything worth having is camped by level 50's - if not necros, they're rangers, magicians, wizards, etc.  I understand that lots of them don't have the items themselves, mainly because they powerleveled and now are getting the items they lack from earlier (sort of like all the level 40 plus druids in perma trying for the mammoth hide cloak -- which I got in a group in mid 20's).<br />
<br />
But this is getting soooo frustrating.  Guess I won't be getting a TBB or any of the lguk items myself until I'm 50 myself... which may never happen if some other company sees Verants stupidity and capitalizes on it.  <br />
<br />
VERANT:  FIND A SOLUTION FOR LEVEL 50's CAMPING WHERE LEVEL 35's BELONG BEFORE YOU LOSE A WHOOOLE LOT OF MONEY.  Hate to tell you savvy business types this, but level 50's alone won't keep your company afloat, and when the rest of us quit a whole lot of your resources (zones) will be underutilized at the expense of a few overutilized  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
I realize this is just a game -- but it is rapidly losing it's fun factor.  When it drops just a little bit more, guess I'll have to cut my losses and sell my items on e-bay too... and quit.  Sigh.  Just don't see any other solution since they're not going to fix the problem.<br />

The only way they could stop this is changing items to a special type of no drop.  The items description should not only determin who can use the item, but who can actually pick it up and carry it and accept it in a trade.  This would limit 'camping' to only classes who can use the item.  No necros camping cleric/warrior/druid/whatever stuff, only necro stuff.  Sure, some items all can use, thats fine, but it really sucks when people camp items they cant even use.<br />
<br />
Also, weapons should have a level limit, so newbies wont be running around with a god like weapon.  This would also limit twinking to a certain extent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">02-15-2000, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, this is way to common *sigh*<br />
<br />
On Karana, there is one Necro in particular, though I won't use his name.  We're almost 100% positive he harvests items for Ebay.  He walks into the King room at Sol B, with his pet in hand, ignores everyone who is already in the room, and then proceeds to sit down and wait.  Have you, at lvl 40, ever tried to outbeat a lvl 50 Necro and Pet?  Forget about it.  He won't touch the regular spawns, only the King, and no matter what you do, scream, cast, etc. you will not outbeat him.  And he does this until he's got his needed amount (Saw him there for 4 days straight about a month ago).  Eventually you get tired of the crap and you leave the room, even though you were there first.<br />
<br />
If he just did this in Sol B, it might not be so bad, but he makes his rounds... Guk, Sol B, where ever there are good items he can harvest.  He gets what he needs from one place then moves on.<br />
<br />
Any why not?  Have you gone to Ebay lately?  Have you seen what people are doing?  I pay $9.89/month for Everquest... and I can sell my Runed Falchion for $112.00, my Ykesha for $255.00, my Efreeti Boots for $330.00.  There are currently 52 pages of things listed if you look up &quot;Everquest&quot;, and those harvesters are making $100's-$1,000's per month selling the stuff they harvest.<br />
<br />
I find what these people are doing is disgusting, very bad for the game, and is highly taking away from the fun... BUT what about the people who are bidding on the stuff?  Hate to tell you this, those that are bidding on the stuff is as much of the problem as the ones offering it.  Supply and demand 101.  No demand, no supply... no ebay, stopping the harvesting of items... <br />
<br />
The &quot;bazaars&quot; are bad enough... Ebay, that goes beyond the scope of what this game should be about, and the fact that Verant has done little to nothing to stop this kind of behaviour irritates me.  Forget about petitioning, because the response back is &quot;We can't kick them out of the room, try to take the room back or fight somewhere else&quot;.  Gee, on a serve with 2000+ people on it every night, finding somewhere isn't always possible, and forget about taking the room back.  <br />
<br />
I can't say that I want every item to be No Drop.  Nor do I want to see trading within the game stopped... but something has to be done with these harveters.  Heck, why should the harvesters stop?  They're getting rich.</div></div><hr />

Not likely. These guys have DOZENS of accounts. They harvest, twink &amp; powerlevel their other accounts, and then harvest some more. They have to maintain these high level accts in case they get banned on another. These guys are good business as far as Verant's checkbook is concerned.</div></div><hr />

If you time it right with your atone and a couple nukes frome your party you can steal the kill back.  Give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsai</div><div class="date">02-16-2000, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. as a lvl 50 cleric (on tunare) here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
yeah there are a lot of lvl 50 necros camping stuff for ebay.. that sucks.. not much verant IS going to do about it...<br />
<br />
But, recently with the opening of air.. a zone where there is NO pp loot or gems/trinkets to sell, and when a trip can cost 700pp+ PER PERSON, verant has effectively told all the lvl 50's who want to do air to go back to sol B, lower guk, etc and farm items to sell for pp. So not all of the people in the zones you see camping items are ebayers.. some are there for pp, others for trade items etc.<br />
<br />
Also... lvl 50's being in a place for lvl 35's? The only reason lvl 35's can even go to guk is beacuse its so crowded.. a 6 person lvl 35 group in l guk by themselves won't go very far =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">02-17-2000, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to post this tonight in response to the original post and to the remarks there after.<br />
<br />
I logged onto my 44 cleric today into Sol B at 5:30 p.m.  Was doing really good until a huge train of LDC's come through the zone.  I barely get out...<br />
<br />
Recoup and go back in.  10 minutes later, another train of LDC's.<br />
<br />
Recoup and go back in... 10 minutes later, another train of LDC's... this time I die.. lose lvl 44.  Res myself get 44 back.<br />
<br />
Now at this point it is becoming very evident of what is going on, as shouts and /ooc's are happening in the zone.<br />
<br />
The Necro I mentioned in my first post.. well he was back.  We;ll call him B****R from now on.<br />
<br />
Apparantly around 4:30 p.m. the Priest Room some how killed the King and got the Mith Bracer.  B****R was in the King Room with his pet.  At 4:30 p.m. B****R decided that just wasn't fair and decided to do something about it... his solution.. Train every LDC, Beetle (including Nox and Stone Spider) on the the priest room.  As soon as his pet died and the priest room was agro to everything, he left the zone.<br />
<br />
He then proceeded to take their kills.  SK spawns, dead by B****R.  He totally gave up his harvesting of bracers in the King room to cause more and more deaths, and to get a Mith BP.<br />
<br />
At about 7:30 p.m. people were beyond furious.  Death upon death was caused by the trains that B****R caused.  My RL boyfriends guild showed up to help, so there were about 20 people protecting the priest room, and at that point, B****R decided after harrassing and taunting everyone around him, to take his leave.<br />
<br />
He was back 1 hour later.. and proceeded to begin the trains and KSing again.  We had an entire zone petitioning him, reporting him, and about 15 people in the priest room attempting to handle what he was bringing.<br />
<br />
At 11:00 tonight he pulled his last train.  4 bats and 2 beetles.  I did see a GM finally come to the zone, but B****R was still in the game, and was when I logged off at 12:00.  His parting comments to everyone &quot;See you Soon&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can guarantee that at least 45 characters died tonight (if not more) because of him.  It also turns out that he is notorious for doing this in every zone.  One group member said he had done this in Frenzied room.  Trained them then took the room over.  He does it in every zone that has high items.<br />
<br />
At one point his guild was notified and B****R was removed from his guild by the leader, and I commend the leader for doing that.<br />
<br />
But the point to this post.  B****R was furious that one of his precious Ebay Bracers had been taken from him, and decided to make those that took it pay... and you know what, he did, and he will continue doing so.  We, the entire zone, attempted to band together to stop him and you know what.. it was nearly impossible, and we died many many times attempting to do so.  So here we sit, less exp then we started, and this jerk is still in the game because Verant refused to touch him.<br />
<br />
And in regards to Air and in need of money.<br />
<br />
I make 100PP per night killing Kobolds.  I at lvl 44 have 5000PP sitting in the bank.  Going to Air, you pay an initial 250PP per group for the first stone, and then you can obtain the keys when you are there off of Mobs, and those keys are free.  24 people can get keys right off the bat.<br />
<br />
Hate ... 250PP per group for the stone.<br />
Fear ... No charge.. run through the gate.<br />
<br />
You need money, may I suggest killing Kobolds, or other non-impressive spawns?  Like I said, I make 100PP/night at Sol B killing nothing more then regular little Kobolds.  I simply can not buy the remark that there are 50's (at least on Karana server) camping the &quot;good&quot; spawns because they need to sell the items for money, as it is very HIGHLY rare to see anyone selling anything at the bazaar, instead they are trading it.  Attend the next bazaar and look and see how many 46-50's are selling?  You'll be lucky to count about 5.  To the person who posted.. you may be in that 5.. <br />
<br />
What I am seeing is Level 50 people camping the priest and King room in Sol B, 1 person in each room, and with the servers as full as they are, causing those who should be in that zone getting exp, to not get exp because there is nothing to camp, as the 50's have it taken already.<br />
<br />
I have watched these 50's sit in the room for hours, days.  For an entire 2 weeks, the King and Priest room was camped by the exact same two people.<br />
<br />
I am growing incredibly wearing of this game, and it's people.  And after tonight... very close to quitting.  Why should I have to compete for Exp against a lvl 50 who gets none?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsai</div><div class="date">02-17-2000, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your costs on air are a bit off.. <br />
<br />
gate up is 35pp per person<br />
first key is free (44-70pp sometimes to help 5-6th group get first key)<br />
<br />
ONE mass death adds a cost of 35+180 (coffin)<br />
If we continue than its 210pp or 500pp more per person<br />
<br />
mass death again? thats 215pp more.. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
you have 5000 at lvl 44? well all I can say is congrats to you. I have been naltroning for 4 months and am lucky to have over 500pp.. 100pp per night isn't going to cut it when you spend 2000 in air over the weekend.. only way to do it is to camp items and sell them.<br />
<br />
If you haven't figured it out by now.. Sol B and lguk (cept for the protectors and bugs/bats) are loot camps... not exp camps.. if you want exp there are many less crowded places to get much faster exp<br />

The only places I know of to get steady experience at level 40:<br />
<br />
LGUK<br />
SOLB<br />
PAW<br />
Killing Guards<br />
Spectres<br />
<br />
Let's see, won't kill dwarves or gnomes, so that leaves dark elf guards, ogre guards, and troll guards -- considering both in and out of city zones, that's a whopping total of 6, maybe 7 groups -- or 40 people.  Spectres, another half dozen.  So 50 people take up those spots -- leaving about 500 more wanting experience, in 3 zones.<br />

&amp;gt; gaurds<br />
<br />
Well, since I won't hunt humans or 'good' races, that's limited to Bashers and Bouncers and maybe Dragoons.  All but the Dragoons are pretty much camped on Povar most days.<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; oot cyclopses/dino<br />
<br />
Dino is an interesting camp.  Tough to manage, but with the right group, it can be good XP.  Seafuries are heavily camped on most servers these days<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; rathe mountain<br />
<br />
Hill Giants, and the sphinx (good or evil, take your pick).  HG's are camped quite often, and the sphinx isn't really a viable spawn (long spawn time, hard kill (he's a chanter) and poor loot).<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; paw<br />
<br />
This one is under-utilized.  I think because it's a squirrely zone and people still don't know it.  It takes time to learn pathing and pulling.  May get more popular.<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; Ice giants in ever<br />
&amp;gt; animal pits/ice gaints in ever<br />
<br />
The outside ones are camped heavily.  The inside ones in Perma are tough past the first couple.  You end up pulling the Priest and a couple of giants and all of a sudden you've got a serious problem.<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; kedge is insane exp with the right group.. <br />
&amp;gt; you can literally fight lvl 50 mobs as long as<br />
&amp;gt; you want due to the fast respawn<br />
<br />
Agreed.  Another under-utilized zone, probably due to the whole drowning fear and lack of experience.  Growing in popularity, though.<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; spectres (oot, oaisis, ferrrot)<br />
<br />
Almost always camped.<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; 6 min named mobs (several of these that <br />
&amp;gt; are lvl 40 or so)<br />
<br />
Are there any of those that a &quot;good&quot; person could legitimately kill?  Any of them give XP to L47?   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
&amp;gt; kithor forest<br />
<br />
Only at night, and not easily pulled.  The zones are hunted most nights, but deep in, people don't generally venture.  We took an over-kill force into the forest the other night and cleared huge amounts of spawns.  It was a blast, but I wouldn't do it with less than a full group of 45+ or two groups of 40's.  There are places in there that pop static 8-10 MOB spawns, and a lot of them are highish level casters.<br />

Mind you, the main char is a cleric, but this kind of stuff sure doesn't help us any. Don't expect Verant to try and stop it either. There is nothing to stop the seller from creating another account and thus making Verant more money.<br />
