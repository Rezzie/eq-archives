<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ergo</div><div class="date">10-29-1999, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 19th, almost 20th, and I spent a fair amount of time in Crushbone.  I went there at 19th and have been there trying to get a screaming mace.  I found that the legionnaires were safe to solo at this level, and if you can get a group of your level together, that you can take Crush and Dvinn, and it's really good experience.  The loot is pretty good here, too.  Plus, the shoulderpads quest in Kaladim is awesome xp.  I turned in 4 pairs of them and get nearly a bar of experience at 19th level.<br />
<br />
  Getting a tunic from Crush to get a Dwarven mace is not all that difficult.  A good group will usually let the cleric loot Crush if they know you are after a Screaming mace.  I got two of the tunics (not at the same time, of course), but ended up wearing one, and making a dwarven mace out of another one.  The Orc Warlord is somewhat rare, and rarely drops the bracer.  So, a lot of people end up buying the bracer, or trading for it.  But if you don't mind the competition, and camping a  bit, you can get one, and get a screaming mace.  It's a great weapon at this level, until you can get a cold-iron morning star from Permafrost.<br />

Ergo, test server<br />
