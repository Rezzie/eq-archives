<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ming</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Yaulp line of spells is far from useless, as is so often said about it.  The next time you're on...cast yaulp and watch your stats, specifically STR and AC. <br />
<br />
Q: Why do you clerics want high AC? <br />
A: So we don't get the **** knocked out of us when our heals taunt.<br />
<br />
Q: Well how long does yaulp last?<br />
A: 15 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
Q: How long do mobs stay agro on you after your heal taunts a mob?<br />
A: Oh about 10 to 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
Q: Is it really necessary to use up a spell slot just for a bit extra AC?<br />
A: That depends on whether or not you have a balanced crew. If you have other classes around like an enchanter to mez and stun, wizard to stun, and druid/ranger to snare then why not keep it memmed? If you're doing the atoning/ stunning/  pacifying/buffing/healing/invigoring/ AND want both divine's and a gate spell you suck anyway and yaulp won't help you.<br />
<br />
With a good crew yaulp fits into my loadout nicely. I should also point out that I like smacking things with my &quot;Holy Stick of Unholy Assbeating,&quot; (tm) and with shaman buffs, bard song, and yaulp my STR is 225. Without bard song and shammy buffs I usually have a STR of Earth form the ranger or druid which puts my str at a lowly 165. Hehe....so smacking stuff for 46 damage can be fun. If your crew kicks ass like mine, the chanter will cast speed on you and you get to do 300-500 melee damage a mob. (just dont forget to heal people, its addicting:)<br />
<br />
In summary...yaulp isn't the greatest spell, but it's fun to cast and very helpful for AC when that big ass mofo gets on you as it casts almost instantly.<br />

I can get my STR up nicely from 70 to around 170 with a druid buff and Yaulp  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

As long as I have the armor to tank and my favorite rogue to backstab/evade I will happily stand opposite her, miss with my weapon, and yaulp to reduce damage. A couple of yaulps will save me a heal so it is quite mana efficient.<br />

<br />
Q: Have you ever wanted to go North?<br />
A: Maybe.<br />
<br />
Q: Has sense heading ever failed?<br />
A: Probably.<br />
<br />
Q: Has anyone in your party ask which way is North?<br />
A: All the time.<br />
<br />
I will swap this out with Sense Summoned or Halo of Light all the time. I hate people who dog it.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />

<br />
Ever get bored just sitting there with yer thumb in yer ass while the party is ripping through mob after mob...clarity II is keeping  you at FM, the shammy pets even have SoW, and you've filled all of your non essential socials with macro's that say &quot;Long live the goat king in Latin?&quot;  Ok then. I didn't use Yaulp until level 52 as described above....but when trying to max 2HB it came in handy and I realized..hey this spell is pretty cool. It costs jack, casts instantly, and buffs the heck outta me.<br />
<br />
And true north is a lifesaver. I can't believe you mock it. Gordon's gonna be so upset if he hears about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ladida</div><div class="date">06-30-2000, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am being totally serious. This one time I had to go North, right. So I hit Sense Heading. It said I was going West. I am like WTF! I need to go North. So I turn &amp; hit it again. SouthEast! OMG! This must have gone on for like 40min or so. I finally remembered I had Sense North enscribed in my spell book. So I memorized it and casted it. I WAS GOING NORTH! Woohoo! And it hardly used any mana! So off I ran truly North, happy as can be. Till I hit a tree and had to cast again.<br />

How about some doors where you have to be facing PRECISELY north to walk through them?  Or tightropes running exactly north/south?  Or a Test of North?<br />
<br />
At least they improved the spell from beta, where I hear it was True Up.<br />

<br />
True North, on the other hand, is one of those spells that you don't need until you really need it.<br />
<br />
The first time I was teleported to the NK druid circle and was trying to figure out which way to go, True North saved the day.<br />
<br />
And, it is good to practice with.  I tend to stand to the South of the brew barrels so that I can practice divination and brewing at the same time.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who gets more skill increases after having a little nip?<br />

I can't seem to figure this out.   You hit sense heading and see you are going west.  You turn some and hit it again and going south east.  Why didn't you just either continue turning in the direction you went the first time a little more, or go back the opposite direction you went the first time plus a little extra?  The only time I have ever used sense north was when I needed to practice my divination.<br />
