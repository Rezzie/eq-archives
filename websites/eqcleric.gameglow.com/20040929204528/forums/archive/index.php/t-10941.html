<br />
We gave him a try tonight and we were demolished.  We had a couple nasty suprises during the fight though and we lost from the beginning.  Just curious as to what kind of tactics are used against this guy and his little pets of mass death.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<br />
How did you try it?<br />
<br />
Might be a simple method change.<br />

AAry is kept in the hallway before his pit, the guards are brought around the corner to where the clerics are.  <br />

Lots of modrods<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looking back at the fight and talking over things with the guild on our messageboard, I think I see where we went wrong.  The fake manadrain AOE killed us.  By the time we knew that we could insta click the mana back, we had lost our main tank and a number of others.  Through our CH rotation out the window and no one was able to stay up long enough.<br />
<br />
What we did was pull Aary and his pets down the hall to the bottom of his ramp and to the door that leads to Ikky and Eashan's(sp?) rooms.  Our clerics hid in a room and we healed from there while we did our best to try and wax at least one of the pets.  The casters stayed near the door and were supposed to open it and go through when the AE macro was hit.  In the end, we got one pet down to about 30 or 40 percent but the problem was all of the early deaths.<br />
<br />
Also one other question, what is a good number of Clerics/people for the fight?  Looking for realistic numbers here.  For the most part, we're in full (or near full) Skyshrine Armor with about a quarter or a third of our melee Primal equipped.<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton.<br />

We put the clerics on the railing behind the wall and you can ch the MT who should be positioning Aary's head right at the corner.  If you are getting his 2 guards with him then what we do is kill the pets first while the ch chain keeps the MT alive.  Our monk has gotten good enough to pull his pets to the zone in room so we dont have to fight him and his pets together anymore though.  Make sure you kill all the babies at approximately the same time since having these respawn during the fight can mean a loss.  Also make sure you have timed killing the two normal drakes near the stairs to NToV so you dont get respawn of them either.  Aary is a tough fight as dragons in NToV go so keep your chins up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just wondering if you have killed Aaroy recently, because I THINK his pets<br />
ALWAYS come with him together now.  Our monk puller is stupid good,<br />
but we don't even waste our time trying to separate them any more.  I could<br />
be wrong tho, happens occasionally..;-)<br />
<br />
Anyway, the methods listed are basically what we do.  Raid to kill him<br />
goes like this:<br />
<br />
1 - Non KoS get the long hallway<br />
2 - Summon KoS and start smacking the Hatchlings (as fast as possible)<br />
3 - Pull front 2 Drakes<br />
4 - Kill Chickens again<br />
5 - Pull Aaroy and his pets.  We put MT with healing chain on Aaroy and<br />
 1 tank on either of the other pets.  Everyone but MT and one of the other <br />
 tanks kill one guard, then the other.  Around this time someone usually<br />
 screws up and Aaroy gets around the corner and screws us over.  If that<br />
 didn't happen we would just bag Aaroy then.<br />
6 - Rez up, clear Chickens again<br />
7 - Kill Aaroy solo<br />
<br />
Believe it or not our slow the 2 times we killed him was created by…<br />
<br />
a Ranger with Epic…<br />
<br />
Our other slowers just get drained too fast.  We load up on other slow<br />
weapons in an attempt to get him slowed (Truncheons, Willsappers, etc).<br />
<br />
We use about 6 clerics on the CH chain, and with that many we need<br />
about 1-2 supah Mod Rods each.  Note that this is a guild that has<br />
exactly ONE primal weapon, and that is on someone who came from <br />
another guild.  Primal is nice, but by no means necessary.  Both times<br />
we have killed him we did it with about 36-40 people.  We are a rather<br />
cleric heavy guild, thankfully…hehe.<br />

Dont even try to ask me how I am a cleric I dont know a damn thing about how he did it.  I know that now since he can do it it makes Aary even more of a joke than he usually is.  By the way Flurries sux.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seethur</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont need a ch rotation for aaryonar, and if your guild is using one they are continuing the dumbing down of the cleric class.  <br />
Just assign 3 mts to aary, and have rest of guild kill the guards 1 by 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, the fake DOT killed us on Monday.  We went back at him today and nailed him on the first try.  Apparently some other guild had already killed the guards but failed to kill Aary so we went straight for him.  Knowing that the Mana Drain could be clicked away from the beginning helped a ton.<br />
<br />
We used a MA CH Rotation.  Had 6 Clerics in the Rotation and we started with very low delays, think in the neighborhood of 3 seconds.  We eventually increased it since our tank was getting very small heals.  I was in the Rotation and managed to end the fight with about 50 or 60 percent of my mana after using one 3 charge Rod.  In the end we only lost 3 people to him (all to Enrage).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zalah</div><div class="date">04-06-2002, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. you can avoid the AE<br />
2. aaryonar can be split from his guards<br />
3. MT group was necessary for us<br />
<br />
thx for the comments, we killed Aaryonar tonight for the first time and with 36people! it's definitely clearing a milestone in the pathway to NToV  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">04-08-2002, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Need for CH rotation isn't the point at all.  It works, it works well, and it<br />
isn't cheating.  So why not use it?  The fact that you are going to use a <br />
perfectly viable method that keeps the most people alive at the end (quite<br />
often everyone) is not a thing that one should be ashamed of.<br />
<br />
Some battles are easier done without it (I mean, except for pre-slowed <br />
Dozekar, who needs a rotation with him?), but when you are first doing something<br />
doing it easy and making it work is better than doing it hard and failing.<br />
Any combat where the main tank will evaporate before a single CH can <br />
hit (and there are many) from full health begs for a rotation.  And if you<br />
say 'well, use several main tanks and have 2-3 clerics on each' that is<br />
a rotation, just a smaller one.  Our guild, mostly primal-less (but should<br />
start getting some soon), quite often does battles with only 3 clerics in<br />
their own personal rotation on the MT, while all the other clerics heal<br />
their group.  Much more interesting, and less prone to battle spam, than<br />
a full-fledge rotation between 6-7 clerics.<br />
<br />
When you are trying things with small numbers, keeping all attention<br />
on the MT is kinda key, dontcha know..<br />
