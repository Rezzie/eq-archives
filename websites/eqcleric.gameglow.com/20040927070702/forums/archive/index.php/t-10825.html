<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyvern G</div><div class="date">03-06-2001, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that whenever I cast CH alone to heal someone in say icewell keep, I do not get the desired faction hit.<br />
<br />
Is this a bug? working as intended?  Somewhat annoying to have to A) land a spell or melee for more than 0 damage, or B) cast a non CHing heal, even tho the lvl 1 spell does the trick, who wants to waste a spell slot on that?<br />

It is probably considered 'broken as intended'.  Just use a low-level spell on the mob, such as strike and you will get faction hits.<br />

<br />
lately ive been sacrificing a spell slot for minor healing, healing someone who is tanking will yield faction, healing someone who is doing damage but not taking hits, will not.<br />
<br />
if you want to melee, you have to actually hit it, cant miss only.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">03-12-2001, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like to use Strike (Level one DD) to ensure faction hits. <br />
<br />
Little mana, fast casting, low resists.<br />
<br />
Healing alone has never caused a faction hit to my knowledge.<br />

I've always been able to get faction for a mob by simply hitting my assist key on someone fighting it. Don't even have to swing, just have autoattack on for a moment while the mob is aggro on someone else and you get the faction.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that CH tends to miss faction adjustments.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm....in my experience fighting giants in Kael, even a single resisted stun would give me the desired faction hits.  Strike or any DD would no doubt have worked just as well, but I pretty much always have baby-stun loaded.<br />

I find its worth just swapping strike in and out for a buff (ie keep it in a buff slot except when you want to buff!) when faction hunting.<br />
<br />
I figure you can cast stun then sit down and have a chance that mr mob will summon you and smack you round a bit or cast a DD for 5 hps that a mellee can jump above you on the aggro list with one hit.<br />
<br />
And dont rag me about stunning too early etc, you all know sometimes no matter how late you cast the old stun, if youve been healing the mob takes offence to it (especially giants!).<br />

Remedy wasn't working on the kael giants last week either. I ended up loading strike and throwing that once per giants to get the faction hits.</div></div><hr />

I usually just whack each giant with a stun.  Doesn't do anything, but does give me a faction hit when the mob dies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miserie</div><div class="date">03-29-2001, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched my faction closely when hunting in Karnors, and this is what I observed:<br />
<br />
Casting a single heal in a fight almost never earned a faction hit.<br />
<br />
Casting two heals took a hit less than half the time.<br />
<br />
Casting a third heal usually earned a hit.<br />
<br />
Casting any offensive spell earned a hit.<br />
<br />
CH seemed to earn hits less often than remedy.<br />

Doesn't this mean that we can hunt in PoG without the faction hits if we stick to the Heavy Tank groups and just use CH?</div></div><hr />

Went almost 6 mobs before I CH'd someone who was tanking at the time and i took a faction hit.</div></div><hr />
