I was 50 before I got my first piece in Hate. Boots. And since I never managed to get a girdle whil ein Fear, I traded my Efreti boots for a girdle.<br />
<br />
Got my second piece at 51. Gloves. GOt my 3rd piece still in 51, Bracer.<br />

Don't sweat it, you'll get it eventually.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimette</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello Creadance - thanks for ressing Soong last night after he accidentally stunned the bank teller. I was trying to get down there, but the Window room in Sol B got wiped out and I was in the middle of helping them with their corpse recovery.<br />
<br />
It's the week for Bertox Clerics to all hit 50, I see. Brodder two days ago, and Creadance and I due any moment now (I spent last night in Permafrost getting some Icy Greaves for a bard friend, otherwise I would have dinged)<br />
<br />
I haven't even been to the planes yet, mainly due to my being out of phase with the rest of the world. I entered Kedge for the first time this week, and haven't been in the City of Mist, Old Seblis, Skyfire or Trakanons Teeth yet. (Then again, I set foot in Crushbone, Unrest and Mistmoore for the first time at 45th) So, I'm probably more of a stay at home then most.<br />
<br />
Currently I have (I knew I should have joined in that equipment thread): <br />
<br />
Left Ear     : +3 wisdom Earring<br />
Neck         : Chryso Talisman<br />
Face         : +7 wis / +7 str Veil<br />
Head         : +50 mana Platinum Tiara<br />
Right Ear    : +3 wisdom Earring<br />
Left Finger  : +6 wisdom ring<br />
Left Wrist   : +5 wisdom cleric quest bracer<br />
Arms         : Cleric quest<br />
Hands        : Jascinth (+20 mana, +20 hp, AC 10)<br />
Right Wrist  : +5 wisdom cleric quest bracer<br />
Right Finger : +6 wisdom ring<br />
Shoulders    : +7 wis Adamantine Epolets<br />
Chest        : +2 wis Robe of the Seeker<br />
            or Legion Gi<br />
            or Black Enamel Breastplate<br />
            or +3 wis Bloodstained Tunic  <br />
Back         : Cloak of the Mammoth<br />
Waist        : Thick Leather Apron<br />
Legs         : Cleric Quest<br />
Feet         : Cleric Quest<br />
Weapon       : +9 wis Paw of Opolla<br />
Shield       : +9 wis Charred Guardian<br />
<br />
This is my normal equipment, and gives me 178 to 181 wis and 786 to 806 AC self-buffed.<br />
As you have probably seen, I change chest pieces all the time, but the 'Serious' suit is the bloodstained tunic or the Black Enamel BP.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how you are going, but over the last few levels I've received a few /tells asking me to come up to fear or hate, normally shortly after I hear 'Wow, Hate just got wiped out' or something like that  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
This tends to discourage me from heading up there, as I'm unguilded by choice and tend to only hear the bad side of the plains<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't worry about how long it takes you to get planar armor.  Currently at level 53 I only have 2 pieces of plane armor.  I won the helm from hate after spending 2 1/2 weeks camping up there in the SW corner straight (prior to the patch where they added 3 things in that corner).<br />
<br />
I had been level 50 for quite some time before I won that helm.  I won the boots by default (only cleric out of 3 in fear that didn't have them already) when we killed a jello mob.  Eventually I would like to go back to hate and get more armor, but i'm not overly concerned about it.  Take your time and enjoy your game and get up there when you can, but don't make it a be all, end all to your armor quest type deal.  There is a a lot of nice items coming out of Kunark, so don't think that armor from the planes is the only stuff you will need or want to get.<br />

<br />
50th level cleric has EM boots in the bank, wear my Efreeti<br />
<br />
53rd level cleric gave my EM Girdle to a guildmate because I needed the STR from the TBB.  No planes armor and I can still get 211 WIS with the equipment I have.<br />

<br />
Did Fear for a night, and I nearly fell asleep.. after it's broken it's more boring than Guk.  But more annyoing cause there are 20 some people asking for buffs.  Wanting peridot buffs, etc.  Arg.<br />
<br />
Besides - who needs that purple stuff when there's Mourning armor to be had?   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

See ya online.<br />
