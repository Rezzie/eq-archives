<br />
You begin your career near the zone line in Ak'Anon. If this is your first time being in Ak'Anon it can be both hard (read, isnt the easiest zone to know where your going) but is one of the greatest looking cities in Norrath, imo.<br />
<br />
First off, scribe your two spells: Minor Healing and Courage.  Then mem them into where you see fit, and then cast Courage on yourself.  Courage is our first HP/AC line of buffs.  <br />
<br />
Next, read your guild note and follow the directions on it.  This is your first quest, and I do not want to spoil the surprise, but have fun exploring your new home.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have completed your quest, I have found it best to level up in Steamfont Mountains (the only exit out of Ak'Anon). <br />
<br />
Once you zone out and go through the tunnel you will see a few guards protecting our city and a road. On both sides of you will be huge mountains.  Follow the Mountain wall to the left.<br />
<br />
Here you will see many new creatures including; Rats, Infected Rats, Spiderling, Decaying Skeletons, and Kobalds.  <br />
- Kobalds are the only MOB that you will find here that will automatically attack you, even if you dont do anything to them.  <br />
- Spiderlings and Decaying Skeletons will not auto attack you, but will aid one another if you attack them. Due to this, watch out where your fighting as you may end up with more than you can handle.<br />
<br />
This is how I proceeded through levels 1-4:<br />
<br />
Level 1: Rats, Kobalds and the occassional Decaying Skeleton<br />
Level 2: Same as level one, unless your feeling lucky and want to try an even con Spiderling<br />
Level 3: Same as the previous levels but as you can see the XP is moving slowly with these, thus you want to hunt Spiderlings more. [Note: Remember to not attack Spiderlings when they are close to one another, as they WILL all aggro on you]<br />
Level 4: Same as 1-3, but XP can come less than the previous levels.<br />
<br />
Many will say to only hunt at the Kobald Camp 1 (near the merchant/Druid Ring), but I find that I can kill alot of lower level MOB's and get more XP than killing one or two Kobalds at the camp and med'n. <br />
<br />
Good luck on your new journey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to add, though, that I have watched someone else hunt that zone, and it seemed to me that the game was somewhat thinner than that around, say, Qeynos, Kelethin (not a cleric city, anyway), or Freeport.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I haven't tried a cleric of Bertoxxulous.<br />
<br />
Regarding starting a cleric, and being lost in the town, I'll offer a big hint:  <br />
<br />
All clerics start at the same spot in Ak'Anon, just like all magicians start in their own spot, etc.  Clerics start right at the gates of Ak'Anon where numerous mechanical guards and spiders keep guard.  When you are &quot;birthed&quot;, you are just outside the gate.  If you go left, under the arch of the gate, you'll head towards town, the Priest of Despair, the lake, your guild, etc ... if you go right and avoid the arch, you'll head upwards out of the town and into Steamfont.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
