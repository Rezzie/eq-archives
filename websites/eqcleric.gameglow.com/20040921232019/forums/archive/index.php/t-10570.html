Also, the trek to the Kejekan city is very dangerous as it is in the middle of the zone with lots of nasty agro-types around.<br />
But, this place is great around lvl 25 and up.  You can buy and sell here (but not bank) and there is lots of different creatures near enough to the Warrens exit that with quick decisions there is rarely a need for anyone to die.  <br />
I haven't completed any of the quests out of the cat city, but there seems to be plenty to attempt if you are interested in some new chores.<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />
