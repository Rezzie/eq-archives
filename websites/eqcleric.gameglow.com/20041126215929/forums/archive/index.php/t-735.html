Do you really think Verant keeps a score card with tick marks to determine which class gets the next enhancement or nerf?<br />
<br />
I read some of that thread and skimmed the rest, and what I got out of it was &quot;Clerics are bored&quot; and &quot;increase Dodge.&quot;  Ok, I'm sure there's no correllation between the two, but one I'd like to see fixed only I've yet to see a good solution (re: boredom) and the other is a pretty big non-issue (re: increased dodge).<br />
<br />
The Res issue was pretty much a slam dunk, but only because a LOT of factors really came together (e.g. universal class support, tons of bump attention, a good issue).  I'm leery of going forward with something (eg. increase Dodge request) that would be so easy for Verant to reject.<br />
<br />
I'd just prefer to save our ammo for an important fight.<br />

I agree... if we hold the demands till something important comes up, we're far more likely to be heard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dekker</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that Dodge isn't the fight to<br />
fight.<br />
<br />
But would you not agree that the cleric<br />
class could use something to spice<br />
it up post lvl 50?<br />
<br />
They screwed the pet. They didn't<br />
give us anything special spell-wise,<br />
it is just more of the same.<br />
<br />
Your life as a cleric to lvl 60<br />
is the same as it was at lvl 49<br />
or even lvl 44.<br />
<br />
You keep almost the exact same<br />
spells loaded too. Likely<br />
Remedy, Complete Heal, DA,DB,Stun,Stun, Atone<br />
or Direct Damage, then maybe gate/root.<br />
<br />
&quot;Buff, med, Complete Heal, med, buff&quot;<br />
and repeat. <br />
<br />
I have seen real human clerics replaced<br />
by hotkeys and people's 2nd computers.<br />
Why should we play a class where you<br />
are so easily replaced by a meleer<br />
who pays attention to the cleric<br />
on his second account about 10% of the<br />
time? <br />
<br />
Of course you'll tell me that people<br />
can add so much more than their class<br />
if they are skilled at the game overall.<br />
True, but that doesn't refute that 90%<br />
of a clerics usefulness can be replaced<br />
with a 2nd account and a 2nd computer.<br />
<br />
Consider what other classes are as<br />
one dimensional? One couldn't do that<br />
with a pet class, or an enchanter or<br />
a shaman, nor with any melee as they<br />
need their full attention on the pathing<br />
of the mobs to attack. Hmm druid maybe,<br />
wizard? probably not.  But cleric?<br />
yes, because their essential duty is<br />
to med and complete heal.<br />
<br />
Every other class post 50 will find the<br />
cleric fun and essential to their<br />
grouping. But does the cleric himself?<br />
If for no other reason than to get<br />
a group fast to see new polygons of a<br />
new dungeon, that in itself can be the<br />
only reason to play a cleric post 50.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am still looking for a <br />
convincing reason to level post 50.<br />
<br />
Mark of Karn, the pet, even Naltron's<br />
Mark are not convincing enough.<br />
<br />
Bash might be fun after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd have to agree with Rayne on this one.<br />
<br />
The simple emotional color of the post is that it's time to decide what to have a &quot;battle&quot; about.  And that's the wrong attitude.<br />
<br />
Is it fun in and of itself to speculate on what would be nifty to alter in the cleric class?  Absolutely. It's a nearly endless source of entertainment.  <br />
<br />
But we should not be looking for a battle just because we are bored and we can start stirring the pot.<br />
<br />
I'll be the first in line to voice some ideas on what could be altered about clerics to make us more fun while giving us no change in combat capabilities or balance.  I do think we get boring to play at later levels.  But that does not mean we should pick a fight with Verant just because we can.  <br />
<br />
I'd like to see change because we make some polite inquiries on the new kinder, gentler EQ boards and see if anyone agrees and if verant is interested.<br />
<br />
Save the thought of battles for when Shaman and druids get 49th res or complete heal or group heals or something like that.  Things that harm our ability to find groups and enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Manwe</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well you guys are all just too subdued.  If you let all the other classes keep moving ahead and just sit and take it, by the time you need to say something it will be too late.  So you are going to wait till shaman and druids get our res and heals before crying, bah, by that time the damage is already done and there will be nothing they will be able to do to fix us.  I am extremely unhappy that there was no new dimension added to our class in Kunark.  So what if we can always find groups.  If any of you don't think that our job is absolutely boring now then what are you doing different than me?  We are no different than we were at 49, yes our res gives 6% more exp, so what.  I still use my lvl 44 heal more than any other.  Its crazy.  I for one always said that they should have given us a ch with faster casting and less mana.  That would have been an upgrade!  <br />
Also why can't we stand up once in a while and melee.  Would it really unbalance anything if we could melee a bit better, NO!<br />
Because most of the times you are sitting on your ass anyway.  For us to not get any melee skill cap increases was like a pie in the face.  Another thing, what's with all the damn fizzles on our new heals.  I fizzle divine light sometimes 3 times in a row.  Its a joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tanzin</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmmm.....I can see your point a bit Manwe. I recently retired my cleric for somewhat similar reason to what you posted. However, it was mostly due to the fact that I have not had the time to group exclusivly and, lets face it, a cleric soloing is not much fun. Yes it can be done, but from a down time versus exp earned, it is slow. Now, my shaman gives me more options along those lines. I am still a great benefit to a group, but I can solo effectively when constrained by time. Plus, when I get to 34 and get a puppy, I will be able to mellee again. I guess it would probably be a bit better to ask for a bit more weapon ballance with shaman. Really, what would it hurt to give a cleric the ability to max their weapon skill at 200? How many clerics would really see enough mellee to reach this level? Not many, but it is a bit of an &quot;upgrade&quot; with out unballancing the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Continually asking for improvements to the Cleric class is in my opinion revving up the Verant nerf engine. I agree with many other posters on the boards here that our Class is good as it is, and any substantial increases to our abilities short of a universally accepted change like the Res issue will come back around to bite us in the arse.<br />
<br />
Say that we can get Verant to increase the WIS Caster's Dodge cap to a higher level. What would Verant nerf to maintain their hallowed &quot;class balance&quot;? Do we lose a piece of the % bonus to our heals? Does our weapon skill cap decrease to compensate? Or even worse, does Verant improve on all of the other classes as well to maintain balance, and thereby preserve our perceived inequity?<br />
<br />
Personally, I want Verant to leave the Cleric class alone. <br />

<br />
If being a cleric bores you, then play another class for a while. Try to see the game from a non-cleric's point of view. In particular, try it from a paladin's point of view.<br />
<br />
Post-50 clerics have it great compared to some of the other post-50 classes *coughRANGERcough*. Save your energy for the cleric nerfs yet to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saara</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm surprised that so many people are up in arms over the fact that the role of clerics did not change dramatically. Clerics are an extremely specialized class, and the post 50 spells only reinforce that and make the class more specialized and more efficient (barring the fizzle rates which are a problem with all casters, not just clerics.)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what people expected, and I have seen many positive responses to many of our post 50 spells. No, they aren't all a godsend like complete heal... They are specialized for different situations, and if anything, give us a bit more versatility in the healing department. <br />
<br />
Since about level 20 (most clerics will agree) the primary role has been to med/heal/med/buff... Throw in some stuns, and maybe an undead dd. I just don't understand this expectation that the class would take a major change of direction post 50.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it wouldn't be nice to get things on the current wish list, new toys are always nice.. However Manwe said:<br />
<br />
 <br />
If you let all the other classes keep moving ahead and just sit and take it, by the time you need to say something it will be too late.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I have to disagree.. Of the *major* issues which have been supported and pushed by the clerics as a community, I think most of them have been addressed: <br />
<br />
1. Difficulty of Clerical Quests<br />
2. Ac of quest armor<br />
3. Res issues<br />
<br />
All three were very large issues that had a big impact on our class. All were addressed by Verant. <br />
<br />
I personally feel that in their own role, clerics are one of the most powerful classes in the game. No other class bests us at our specialty, and yet we still have functionality in more spell lines than several of the spell classes. We can heal, buff, cast dd's, stuns, and our usefulness in a group is unquestioned. There are many classes who would kill to be in our shoes as far as overall usefulness.<br />
<br />
In closing I have to agree with Rayne on this. We should save our ammunition (as it is) for the issues that are important. Our class as a whole has never been one to complain all the time about our class, and I hate to see that starting. <br />

Basically speaking, many players have found that playing a cleric past level 49 is boring.  We become so highly specialized in function at this point that many people have ceased playing their clerics.  <br />
<br />
The &quot;battle&quot; that needs to be fought is how do we make playing a cleric interesting enough to encourage people to play past level 49.  Granted there will always be a subset of people that find post 49 play stimulating enough to continue doing so - but many are finding the exact opposite.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarf</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have a couple things to say.<br />
<br />
First, if Clerics stop playing Clerics post 50, Warriors, Pally's, Sk's, Monks, Bards and any other person that thinks they play a tank will scream bloody murder to enhance clerics.  They need us.  This is not a fight we have to fight.  <br />
<br />
I hate to see all the posts from Wizards, Rangers, Monks and Rogues complaining about how awful it is to play those classes.  I would hate to see it happen with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, the boredom issue.  Fine, I'll grant that at times it's extremely boring (I'm back to running two characters again).<br />
<br />
So, how do we fix it without screwing up the balance?  Because if you can't come up with the answer to that you'll be pissing in the wind.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suesc</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took &quot;battle&quot; to be a bit tongue in cheek.  Perhaps I was wrong. Hoever, I don't think speculating about what could be is all that bad.<br />
<br />
In any event:<br />
<br />
As I hear it, there are two sides emerging-<br />
<br />
1) We are fine. Leave well enough alone.  Or alternately- hide- we don't want verant to notice us and nerf us 'cause I can live with things as they are.  <br />
<br />
2) We are not fine- we could be better, more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
I think both sides will have to agree to disagree :P<br />
<br />
That said, I don't believe Verant has a corner on the market for inventiveness.  I believe Verant lurks on many message boards, and reads them, and who knows- maybe some of these thoughts will be implemented. I believe too, that whoever at Verant conceived of the cleric as it exists in eq could use a little help in the imagination department while Verant does their &quot;class tweaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I am sure Verant dislikes most is infantile whining and verbal abuse.  If they dislike customer input, then they shouldn't be in the business of providing a service directly to a customer.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dekker</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that needs to be made abundantly<br />
clear.<br />
<br />
I am talking about post lvl 50 clerics<br />
only.<br />
<br />
I think clerics are fine until lvl 50.<br />
We start out fun. We slow down in the<br />
20s-34s where druids/shamans can heal<br />
just as well. We become essential<br />
from 40-50 after we have Complete<br />
Heal. (so we mature late)<br />
<br />
We become absolutely POWERFUL at lvl 44,<br />
masters of undead damage, (approaching<br />
lvl 44 wizards), masters of healing<br />
(with the level 39 Complete Heal),<br />
and GODLY at lvl 49 with the 49 res,<br />
wanted by every group doing anything<br />
in the game.<br />
<br />
Post 50, I don't see it.<br />
<br />
Remember all the other classes want<br />
a lvl 60 cleric in their group, but<br />
what is the reason for that cleric<br />
to be level 60 themselves?<br />
<br />
Just because everyone else wants them?<br />
Why? They could be lvl 49 and<br />
do just as good a job, and likely<br />
even have less fizzles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading this and rereading the other thread I can see our original goal was lost. First off, I think Brodder was trying to get some ideas as to what we would like to see, sort of a cleric wish list. Unfortunately, some people view their clerics as boring and stated any changes would be insufficient to save the class (wasn't aware we were in trouble). We're not trying to fix &quot;boredom&quot;.<br />
<br />
Second, I (at the very least) was not going for the &quot;Fix the clerics! bump the thread!&quot; idea. We can't do that now anyways thanks to the New and Improved(tm) boards. I was actually thinking of picking a minor issue and making a well thought out and rational post about why we need a higher Dodge cap. It's something that we, as a class, actually could use. I would think that we could get a response from Gordon relatively fast IF we keep the tone down. Don't demand we get this, just present our case and, if need be, debate it with Gordon. It's a prime chance to see if the Whineplay ideals are truly dead. (ie &quot;GIMME THIS NOW! Bump, Bump, Gordon and Verant sucks, Bump...&quot;).<br />
<br />
Third, it is a battle that wasn't just picked at random. This battle is quite winnable and doesn't push clerics outside of the Vision(tm). Handing us a higher Dodge cap doesn't hurt anyone.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I would make a concerted effort to NOT whine about it. Whine = nerf. We would offer this as a suggestion. If it gets shot down, so be it. They can't fault us for asking, especially if we're civil about it.<br />

<br />
Ironically, I have run across a few posts recently that state exactly what you have said - what can be done to make clerics more fun to play from the perspective of a non-cleric.  Unfortunately, things will have to deteriorate pretty significantly before Verant will react and then their reaction may well be to give core cleric abilities to other classes (like they did with S Heal and rez) rather than fixing clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistleburr</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings!<br />
<br />
I might be way off base, but being a high level cleric IS fun.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because the high level game provides far more situations where the team must smoothly work together. Where the expertise and skills of each player contribute to form powerful groups.<br />
<br />
And being a cleric gets me in those groups.<br />
<br />
Only high level enchanters have it as good as we do, followed by high level rogues. We get groups. We don't sit around for hours asking the guild or the zone what's going on that we can get in on.<br />
<br />
Talk with your level 56 ranger buddy. How much time do they spend looking for a spot? why did that cute level 54 bard quit? Did she find out that she was constantly passed over for a beefy warrior? Do you think all those necros and wizards in Skyfire are there for the fun of soloing?<br />
<br />
The game is designed to present challenges (read: &quot;fun&quot;) to groups. We get groups. We go deep in Sebilis, prowl around the sewers of Karnor's, explore the royal chambers of Chardok, and blow up undead in Charsis while other classes are kiting wurms and camping zonelines.<br />
<br />
Life as a cleric is GOOD!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me or are there like 2 groups of clerics, the high levels and the low levels, high starting at 44 and if your not 44 you aren't allowed in the club? Dekker just said it 20's and 30's is when clerics slow down because OTHER classes have our abilities, albeit lesser than ours but they have other abilities. I am lvl 19 and it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to find a group!!! This sucks because we are so group dependant. And now I have to wait till I'm 44 till people are gonna want me again?? But I can't get there cause no one wants me and I can't solo, at least not easily like other caster classes. I want to group with people, I have fun meeting people and killing things but half my online time is spent trying to find a group.<br />
Rayne i caught ya http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif you told me before that clerics aren't boring and I should play another class, well I don't want to play another class I LOVE CLERICS!!! They are the best class in any roleplaying game but EQ clerics seem very 2 dimensional. This is why I'm complaining so much, and as i've said many times before I don't want to fight like a tank or cast like a wizzard, I just want to have fun with my favorite class. <br />
Now this is gonna go way out there but seeing as we are wishing here is my wish<br />
I want clerics to be an independant class. Druids and Necros and wizzies are all soloable so why not us? If I can't get in a group I want to be able to play on my own, so either give us something to make us more valuable than druids and shamans (at lower levels) OR give us something that can let us solo. <br />
I am not paying money to play this game to wait around for other people to decide they finally need a cleric because the druid left the group! Then the druid can go out and solo!!!! WTF!?!?!?!?!<br />
Dodge would definatly help in the soloing department and so would bash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jibblybit</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say that I can understand the frustration at the lower lvl.  I am just emerging from this frustrating time, and am only now finding it relatively easy to find a group.<br />
<br />
I love my cleric.  I have fun with the whole halfling-cleric combo.  I am also lucky to be in a primarily ogre and troll guild.  Helps with the grouping.<br />
<br />
As far as whether or not clerics need any enhancements, I can's speak for post 50 of course, but I am generally happy with pre 50.  Ya, it can be tough being so group dependant, especially when you play at European prime time :-p  But it is the long road we must go through to get to the vary desired and powerfull status in the later lvls.<br />
<br />
I have to say I'm in the silent &quot;don't attract nerfs&quot; camp.  But I can certainly understand the desire for more veriety.<br />
<br />
I am particularly proud of the way clerics have generally approached problems on the public message boards, and because of this I think that we are listened to when we do start to really push about an issue.  I would hate to lose this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stroke</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, you know what makes a cleric boring?  the same thing that makes any class boring......the amount of risk you typically play with.<br />
<br />
If  your playing in a happy little group gettin some nice safe xp, single pulls, low blue mobs, little to no risk (read: practically zero chance of death) then you better believer your gonna be bored no matter what class you are playing.  Do you really think a warrior has a more exciting time in that kind of group?  Pull mob (heh, or just wait around for him to pop) hit autoattack, go fix a sandwich.  Pet caster?...send in pet, dot(if applicable), fix sandwich, nuke.  Wizard?....fix sandwich, nuke.  Enchanter?...cast buffs/debuffs, do the mez thing in the 1 in 100 chance that we get 2 mobs.  Drood?...soloing of course (hehe), run, cast, repeat.<br />
<br />
You say that a 2nd account and cpu can replace a real cleric, well if you in the above group, sure it can.  And a 2nd account can also replace a meele, pet class, wiz, chanter, or any priest class.  Bah, if you gave me 6 accounts and 6 computers, and a nice controled area to hunt (of which there are many) and I could play a whole group myself.  Heh, if I had 3 mages, chanter, cleric, puller, I could play all 6 chrs and still be able to go make a sandwich if i could find a mob with enough hp to stand up against 3 ds'd, quickened, mage pets long enough to run to the kitchen.<br />

C'mon, we all know that what really makes the game fun are the high pressure, high risk situations where everyone has to work together perfectly to survive.  If I'm playin in a situation where every single root/park, each pixel of mana, and the timing of each CH, has to be ABSOLUTELY perfect for the group to survive, i DARE you to tell me that isnt fun, and I dare you to say that you could do that on a 2nd account.<br />

Try taking a few nights out from grouping and just run around healing/buffing/etc.. complete strangers. You will be surprised how well people remember you when you help them out of the blue. I did this a few times, and a few nights later, someone that I didnt even remember helping me asked me to join their group. He said he remembered me healing him when he was about to die from poison, and had been looking for a good cleric to join their nightly group. Now I have a regular group I play with and still heal strangers to spread the good faith.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kitsinu</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoy myself as a Cleric.  I can't go AFK for a minute without someone getting into dire trouble.  This is good and bad.  A second computer with someone spending 10% of their time at it?  Sometimes it works that way.  But when the stuff hits the ventilator, I whip out the stuns to disrupt spells, use the root to park mobs (sometimes stunning as a taunt), and can even park things far enough away to Atone them totally out of the fight.  It is almost the same as a Complete Kill spell with no experience gained.  When the puller returns with 10% health and dropping, the find me in the hall frantically hitting the Greater Heal hot key to keep them alive for the Superior Heal.  I station myself within range of the group, but as far out as possible so I cast as soon as possible.  The puller runs back crying &quot;Heeeaaaaallll mmmmeeeee!!!!!!&quot; and the spell goes off before he has even stopped, and I get my back to a wall while recharging and then give them a dose of something else to keep them alive.  Big taunts on the mobs that would have been pounding on the puller give you time to keep him alive.  The tanks and enchanter start pealing things off me, I run away and root any that follow and back out maybe Atoning as I go.  10% of your time?  Yes, if you heal med heal.  I only do things 5 % of the time quite often.  But when it hits, I show the group the true power of a Cleric.  As a Cleric, I am nearly purely defensive in nature.  This is a good thing, since everyone else is nearly purely offensive in nature (exception is made primarily for Enchanters).  With high level Clerics quitting and being replaced by powerleveled Clerics that don't know how to group, let alone know the class, I can shine even greater by comparison.  If you want to impress people without big fights, time your Complete Heals to go off right when the mob dies.  It highlights your skill, experience and your class defining ability : Complete Healing.<br />
<br />
So, what could I possibly wish for to help me do my job?  Dodge goes off rarely enough when things are going bad that it isn't worth the effort.  I don't even use a weapon anymore, since I need mana for big fights.  I have been just barely about to cast that bigger heal that is much more efficient too often when things go badly to not be a believer in mana.  When I am at less than 5% mana after a big fight, I know that my Paw let me get that last spell off that I used to stop a runner (stun/root).<br />
<br />
What I would love is a Standing Meditation spell.  It might be nice to be able to get off of my butt for more than emergencies.  Will it happen?  No, but I can dream.</div></div><hr />
