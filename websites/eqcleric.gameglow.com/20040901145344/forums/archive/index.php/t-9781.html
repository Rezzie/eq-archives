<br />
They mentioned fixing this in a patch notice a while back, but it is not fixed.<br />
<br />
Zoned from Sol B to Lavastorm and took a real hot mud bath... Was at about half bubble life and jumped into the zone to get past an Ogre fattie in the corridor.<br />
<br />
GM ressed me, said they were still working on it, and recommeded relogging to clear some residual bug stuff.<br />

Not only did they not fix the bug, but they made it so that people who had never been affected previous to the &quot;fix&quot; started getting hit.<br />
<br />
They need to rename the test server...<br />

<br />
Have you ever seen the other bug in SolB?  A guildmate of mine was leaving Sol B to zone into Sol A and instead of hitting the zone he got to the top and saw sky. He died from the Kobold that we were running from and his body was out of reach, but we could see it.  It took a GM to get his body and reported the bug.  They told him that it was a known bug that they are working on...<br />

The only time it's ever hit me was when I was very low HP and zoning for my life. With that kind of specificity, seems like it shouldn't be THAT tough to track down a bug related to zoning that doesn't seem to happen in other zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my case I was near dead from a combined LDC/Solusek Kobold train (not dotted thank Bristlebane). Jumped into the zone to get around a fatty sitting at the zoneline.<br />
<br />
So for me at least I was low HP. Survived only two &quot;You are burning&quot; messages before I died, so under 100 HP I would guess.<br />
<br />
P.S. Sorry for the double post, I did not bother to read my original before resupplying the info. Doh!<br />

Perhapse the zone &quot;door&quot; has not been aligned with the graphics and porting you to a &quot;safe zone point&quot;. (Safe, my arse)</div></div><hr />

When zoning with low HP, you instead go to the new zone's &quot;safe spot&quot;. In Lavastorm, it makes sense that the safe spot is in lava, hence the death, but your corpse always turns up near the Nektulos zone. So, if the safe spot is near Nektulos, the lava thing is definitely fugged up.<br />

If you die while zoning, it will almost always drop you in the safe area of the zone you're coming into. It just seems that Verent's idea of a safe zone in Lavastorm is at the bottom of the lava pit.<br />
I really don't understand why this should be so hard to fix.</div></div><hr />
