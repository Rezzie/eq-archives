I'm another one of thouse people that play 2 chars at once. A level 31 warror (ogre) and 30 cleric (Dark elf). In Lower guk (dead side) you will find a small underwater passage way to the right once you zone in. At the end of the passage way it opens up to a bed. This is called &quot;the bed room&quot;. In my case me and my fighter just pull vampire bats, deadly spiders and the occational ghoul knight. The best part of this is. They all con yellow to my warror which means BOOKOO xp.<br />
 <br />
  The bats and spiders hit the warror for about 49 tops. Where as 28th level cyclopses hit for about tops 79 a swing. We where camping qeynos guards (level 30) and hit extremly fast for about 69 a swing. Looking at it in a pure power leveling stand point. This is one of the best bang for you buck.<br />
<br />
  Anther good feature of this is, if your sick of the contiuous trains ie... cazic, Mistmore and cyclopes trains *cringe*. The type of people that are in this zone are from 34 to 50 and are pure profestionals. That means Not many trains. <br />
<br />
  The options in the zone are almost endless. You could just live in there till 50. If you can stand the nonstop croaking. Some of the best Items in the game spawn in this zone. Exe axe,berlap sack,thick banded belt, sarrated bone dirk, adamantite epolets so on and so forth..... My end goal is to be 50 before the expantion comes out.<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope to see you fighting by our sides some day  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Yours <br />
