After all, I only spent close to 100p on potions and KEI.  Not like that would give me the same right to hunt there as some others.  My faoult I guess for not realizing the Oasis Spec hunters that train the newbs at the docks would grow up to train in other zones too.<br />
<br />
And no I wasn't at the zone in, quite a ways from it actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croff</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get Turn undead  at least 2...  Get another person to make a huge undead train (Temple golems, Rocks and worm things are no good.. can't even have 1). Then he runs past you with the 40 undead mobs... make him run them in circles to group them tightly.... when they are like 6 seconds away from you  start casting turn undead.... if they pass you, or if they are too far away just duck and try it again.<br />
<br />
You can get like 3 blues easy a shot. Then you and the other PC solo till turn pops up again. I can get 7 blues an hour easy with my Paladin friend.<br />
<br />
Might want to kill all the rocks around before you pull the train.<br />
<br />
Remember to follow the mobs   or you won't get exp.</div></div><hr />

You have to be darn good and pretty lucky to have any success with it, given the cast time of TU2 and the *radius*.  It's a small area.  I don't have the numbers to toss out but it's not a huge area of effect.  But yeah if you can pack some undead around you, maybe get a chanter partner for ae stun, Turn Undead is awesome here :).<br />
<br />
Oh btw it seems the skels that spawn to the right of the Mons Let entrance have exactly 5k hp...pretty handy if you ask me.</div></div><hr />
