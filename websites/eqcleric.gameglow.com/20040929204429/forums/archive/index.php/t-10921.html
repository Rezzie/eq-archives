<br />
Anyway - I timed the exp gain in a few spots for the fun of it - and was wondering how others fare wrt this. <br />
<br />
- Soloing in the Grey near Pyramid (post nerf, didnt try before) = 1 yellow/240 mins<br />
- Grouped in Ssra (War, Mnk, Magi, Ench, Wiz, Clr) = 1 yellow/120 mins<br />
- Grouped in Maidens Eye (War, Rog, Rng, Wiz, Ench, Clr) = 1 yellow/90 hours<br />
- Medium speed caller in FG (War, Rng, Mnk, Rog, Rog, Clr) = 1 yellow/75 min (was only for one hour though so might be hard to sustain/not fully accurate)<br />
<br />
And for comparison<br />
- Monk solo in FG (60 Iksar with Garns/Primal) = 1 yellow/38 mins (I think thats FAST and yes, I envy him too)<br />
<br />
These are just the spots I got a timing on during the last days where I took the time to take notes for the fun of it.<br />

I've got a rogue I'm still leveling, and I find that experience is still the best in HS and The Hole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone else have any &quot;timings&quot; on camps the have done recently?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heihachi</div><div class="date">12-28-2001, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our AE group averages about 1 skill point every 2.5 hours in sebilis.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">01-01-2002, 05:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to admit I am fairly impressed with your 1yellow/30mins.<br />
<br />
I redid the Callers in FG as well as some more spots:<br />
<br />
- Medium Caller = 1 yellow/85 mins <br />
- Fast Caller = 1 yellow/70 mins<br />
- HS south wing = 1 yellow/62 mins<br />
- Seb AE Necro-Chef = 1 yellow/57 mins (over 11 hours including chaging people a few times)<br />
- Umbral = 1 yellow/115 mins (too many HP on mobs I think)<br />
- The Hole = 1 yellow/75 mins (too many light blue or it would be good)<br />
<br />
Anyway - I could see an experienced AE group doing alot better than we did in Seb. It would likely require Seb to be fairly free of other groups though.<br />

I have to admit that the Exp is still awesome there.. Fungus Grove with 2 Bards, 1 Wizard, 1 Tank and another Cleric is awesome as well. AE-Groups are prolly the best choice in FG..<br />

No, I didnt try out Velks yet. To be honest I was hoping others would contribute too - so maybe you could try Velks and post your results?<br />

From normal experience in 60 i can make around 1 Yellow in around 45-60 minutes with Chanter, Monk, Tank, 2 Rogues. Will test out how it is for AA-experience, since that bar fills faster than the 60er-bar. Will keep you up to date   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">01-03-2002, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think HS is probably one of the better places you can do xp's at (south or east wing would be best bet).<br />
<br />
I went to HS a couple days ago.  I start off just slightly over 2 yellow bubbles of normal XP and 3 blue bubbles of alt xp.  My ratio was set 60% normal xp and 40% alt xp.<br />
<br />
After about 6 hours of xping I had filled 3 yellow bubbles and had 3 and 1 half blue bubbles filled.  I turned my alt xp to 90% and my normal xp to 10% and continued to xp.<br />
<br />
Somewhere about 3 to 4 hours later, I turned my alt xp to 100%.  I was 4 yellow bubbles and half of a blue bubble of normal xp and 4 yellow bubbles with 4 blue bubbles of alt xp at that time.<br />
<br />
After another couple hours (or less - couldn't remember the amount of time) I had finished my first alt xp point and then managed to get 1 more  yellow bubble of alt xp.<br />
<br />
At this rate I will be racking up the Alt xp points in no time.<br />
