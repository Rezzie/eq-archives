<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klang</div><div class="date">03-13-2000, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was looking forward to the expansion because I was hoping it might help on some of the overcrowding problems.<br />
<br />
However, the new healing spell that will be available to druids and shamans makes me wonder it finding a pickup group will become very dificult for 40ish clerics.<br />
<br />
In sol b Ive noticed many groups who dont have a cleric are able to do well enough with a shaman or druid. Most usually want a cleric if they dont have one right now but I wonder if this will change when this new spells goes into effect.<br />
<br />
Just curious about what other clerics think out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squamos</div><div class="date">03-14-2000, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the druids and shamen have to get a better healing spell in the expansion.  They are already hurting at level 50.  Druids in particular have a tough time finding a spot in a group because they have very little to offer.  <br />
<br />
The spells we get in the expansion, at least so far, look good to me.  I am not worried in the slightest about finding a spot in a group.  I will always be a better healer than a shaman or a druid, and I have other abilities to offer too (stun, rez, symbol and much more training on how and when to heal than my druid and shamen brothers).<br />

<br />
We will always be master healers with those group heal spells and the new quick heal.<br />
And it's always nice to have druids/shamen for backup healing.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

But from looking at the new spells thats about it. Shamans and Druids will have better buffs or at least preferable in some cases as in Skin like whatever. So heal and rez sounds like most of what our future will be. Doubt if we will ever be able to solo again (sigh).<br />
