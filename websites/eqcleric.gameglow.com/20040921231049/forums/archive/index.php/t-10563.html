<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twiggets</div><div class="date">04-01-2001, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the scret to getting exp fast ..is finding an area where lots of people are ..that way yoy have a very good chance of getting in a group (since more ppl live clerics).  After reaching lvl 24 I decided to venture forth and visit Kunark!  I most wonderufl place!!  I WOULD NOT recommend getting a teleport there from a druid as you are teleported to the dreadlands ..a most dangerous place.  I simply got a port to butcherblock, than took a boat over.<br />
<br />
Once there I made tracks to the 'Lake Of Ill Omen' ..oh ..the groups there were plentiful!! <br />
<br />
Places I grouped/camped<br />
1) The windmill ..I teamed up with a single hadowKnight and we simply roamed around the windmill ..kill wandering monsters - excellent exp<br />
<br />
2) Goblins ..in the northwest corner of the zone are some goblin caves.  I got in a group and we non-stop pulled the goblins ..until some other group train accidently trained us ..oops<br />
<br />
3) Some abandoned hut ..unfortunately I don't actually know where this is ..it involved some player saying &quot;follow me&quot; ..we went to a hut that had 4 icebone skeletons spawning in each corner - we slayed them all and aso wandering monsters ..again &gt; awesome exp<br />
<br />
4) Sarnak fortress ..by far the place you'll group most.  There's a BD (backdoor) and a FD (front door) and a ledge. The backdoor is the one cloest to the frontier mountains zone. Most people group outside the front door, or inside the door slighty to the side.<br />
<br />
After reach about lvl 27 everything in Lake of Ill doesn't give good exp ..and it's time to head to FRONTIER MOUNTAINS ..I killed giants ..and lots of em!!  Good thing is they occasionally drop forest loops ..I was there for about a solid week and only saw maybe 3.  Friends of mine say waaaay more.  Exp was just freeflowing and non-stop.<br />
<br />
Once I hit lvl 29 I moved the The Overthere ..holy cow! I got even MORE exp tere!!</div></div><hr />
