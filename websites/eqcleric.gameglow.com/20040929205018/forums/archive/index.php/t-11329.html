<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abyssak</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am an evil human cleric out of Freeport, and I did my soloing (up to 14) in Nek Forest, the zone outside of Neriak.  I could go to Neriak 3rd Gate to buy my spells as I progresses b/c I was a worshipper of Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
The place for a cleric to hunt in Nek is in the undead area next to the entrance to Lavastorm Mountains.  At first, you will have to be careful to pull great skeletons/zombies/rotting citizen/Undead Annalkeepers/etc. from the edges of the undead area and into the grassy area surrounding it b/c if you try to fight these guys on their turf, they WILL get plenty of help from their buddies.  However, by 12 and 13 you can pretty much walk around through the area gathering aggro and racking up exp.  <br />
<br />
I prefered this area to others I had heard of b/c (1) It is close to a zoneline that usually doesn't have people around it [at least not on my server] (2) There is a guard nearby in case you pull more than you can handle (3)  Due to the guard and the zoneline, there is a very safe place to meditate [you'll no doubt see the very prominent rock that I'm talking about] and (4)  Neriak is very close by which makes selling and buying new spells a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
I was able to level very fast here.  Try it out and tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />
