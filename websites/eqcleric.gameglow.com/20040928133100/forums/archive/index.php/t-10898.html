<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Connovar</div><div class="date">09-26-2001, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently in a medium sized guild growing in strength from day to day and we've got a few epics (mainly monk and ranger atm)  However, came across this mob the other day for one of our warriors.  Basically we got our but handed to use on a plate.  Was told even staggering complete heals would be to slow due to his 1500hp lifetap.  So we tried spamming smaller heals on him but he quickly went down.  Question I have is this.  I know the use of rune to stop the proc on VS.  Will Nortlav make a beeline to the chanter for runing firstly?  Secondly will staggered complete heals work without runes?  Thirdly would it be best to use the riposte disc so the main tank can keep aggro better and also keep his initial rune intact for the duration of the disc?<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated</div></div><hr />

<br />
My advice would be rune the tank before the encounter starts and then just have several people healing the main tank.<br />
<br />
Either that or have several people assigned to the enchanter that will be runeing and have them chain cast smaller heals to keep him/her alive.<br />

Never fought him, it was just the first thing that came to mind...<br />

I suggest 2 clerics chealing 5 seconds apart, and one enchanter chain runing to be safe.  With one cleric chain chealing, you generate too much aggro and cleric = dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding your question on root, yes root does hold aggro as it makes the mob hit the nearest person to it.  However, in this situation Nortlav is completely magic resistant. He can be hit by cold and disease based spells from memory</div></div><hr />
