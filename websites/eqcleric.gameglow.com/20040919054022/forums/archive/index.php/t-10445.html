Exp was really good ( just dont let anything get away...the trains are bad )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diar</div><div class="date">01-07-2000, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something to note about Befallen is that it's incredibly dangerous trying to solo anything beyond the first floor. So in the larger levels, you're going to need a group... and finding one inside Befallen can be tough.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that getting your corpse back if you die is a real pain. The different sections of Befallen are all hidden behind locked doors that need keys to get through. Since the keys are now on your corpse and not on you, it gets tricky. If you beat a rat or something small up that will run, they will run through the locked doors and -- lo and behold! -- the rats can open the locked doors without a key. So just follow that sucker through.<br />
<br />
Another warning? There are necromancers in the dungeon. This means that Invisibility vs. Undead is risky at best for something like corpse retrieval. Necros will see straight through it and, after they poke you once, everything nearby that's aggro will jump on you.<br />
<br />
So! Befallen's not a bad dungeon at all, but try to keep a healthy group with you and keep in mind that dying here is very, very painful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">calais</div><div class="date">01-07-2000, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A note about corpse retrieval in befallen. This happened to me the other night. Our group got slammed by about 15 mobs. Naturally everyone died. Well i had to log off and get my corpse later. when I did get it a higher level cleric was nice enough to invis to undead me and escort me. Well like an idiot instead of dragging it to the top while still invised( can you even do that or will invis drop?) i looted it. On my way back out a train passed me by and chased me to the 1st locked door. Not having a key i died yet again. But here is the main part of the post. Upon returning i merely /corpse and my body poped through the locked door. Now i know you have to be close but can the same work through walls?<br />

Here are the tips that I can give you. The second you hit 10th level you should live in here till 20th.<br />
<br />
Number one.... <br />
<br />
Don't wander around. Its not worth it. Unless you are with a REALLY REALY GOOD GROUP. What I mean wander around is at 10th though 14th  you should just sit and camp the Skeleton lordd. This guys respawn rate is about 6 and a half mins. THAT IS GOOD!! He also con's you indefrent so you can med to full right next to him until you are ready to rock and roll. Just the second you start fighting him. Start blasting with Undead DD spells. He will go down. If you run into trouble just find a partner (any class just something to take a couple hits)<br />
I know it sounds boring but its the safest and quickest way to level. <br />
<br />
Once you get to 15 hike down to the third level door and camp the Elf skelly. Hang next to the far wall with the hook on it. You sould be safe from the occational train that will run past. But have gate memerized Just in case you see alot of nasties go by. You will defiantly need a tank for this. But just convince him that this is the best and the saftest way of getting xp. <br />
<br />
  Anther important tip about the 3rd level. DON&quot;T OPEN THE DOOR FOR ANYONE &gt;&gt; EVER!!! If they want out let them but don't let anyone in. The less people down there with you the better. ( less trains for you to deal with and screw up your spawn time). It sounds cold but honestly.... DO you like dieing and losing your body behind a locked door?<br />
Didn't think so..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenobe</div><div class="date">01-28-2000, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have to totally disagree with this being a good place for XP.  Solo forget it<br />
there are no safe places here, let me repeat that, there are NO safe places here.  If you are alone and die good luck getting your corpse.  If there are any others down here then you will be trained and good luck getting a gate off in time.  Medding is dangerous because even greens will jump you and Necros wander around.  The 3rd floor is filed with spawns and the like.  You need a good grp to be in here and even then you have to be careful as everthing spawns quick so plan on fighting everything you fought on the way in , on the way out.<br />
<br />
I have been down here 6 times and after all my effort I may have gotten a bub of xp but mainly ended up loosing the rest dying.<br />
<br />
Check this place out once for yourself but I got far better xp and loot fight dervs or Orcs from 10 on up.  If you want to solo undead at this level then either go to NRO or Lfay there is a ruin where 3 mummies spawn that you can pick off one at a time.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
