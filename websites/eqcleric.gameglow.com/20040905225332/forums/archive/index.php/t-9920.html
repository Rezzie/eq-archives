<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaharz</div><div class="date">02-27-2001, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember, everything we hear from Verrant goes the magical &quot;PR filter&quot;<br />
<br />
The whole purpose of PR is to make bad things seem good (or at least not very bad) and good things seem better.  And you hope that people will remember the good and forget the bad. (that part never really works though)<br />
<br />
Or as you put it, the purpose of PR is &quot;blow smoke up our collective arses.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately for us, either they aren't trying hard or their PR people are not very good at their jobs.  They need to get a bigger fan.<br />

<br />
They break all the basic rules of an interaction, especially when they feel they are being flamed.  They respond with sarcasm &quot;I'm sure druids and shamans will be more than happy to fill that role&quot;, become defensive, and take a stance of &quot;we are absolutely right.&quot;  Rather than listening, they defend. Rather than trying to calm people who are agitated, they attack.  <br />
<br />
I do, however, applaud Verant's stance on offering challenging jobs to the clearly socially handicapped and allowing them an opportunity to grow.  :-)<br />
<br />
Sigh....going out to cast complete heal because I LIKE to see the words &quot;loading...please wait...&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always wanted a email address of someone higher up who works for Sony(not Verant) to complain about Verants relations to their customers.  Can't find any sony contacts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;While most clerics in game feel that the increased hate generated by healing is unfair, let us state our intention.  Clerics are not the 'healers of Norath' as they claim.  They share this responsibility with druids, shamen, palidens, and rangers.  The role of the cleric in our vision was as 'experience rez'ers'.  As such, while under review of the class balancing, we found this class defining spell was being underutilized.  We found the best way to get use out of this spell was to have the cleric die more often than they had previously.  If you don't like our vision on clerics, then you shouldn't play one.  Now stop whining.</div></div><hr />
