<br />
I set up on the isle and was only one there.<br />
3 Hours later Soarin Spawned (has shaman only spear) and after a close fight he kills me.So i recover corpse,another 2 hours later another cleric arrives,soon after Soarin spawns yet again.Other cleric nearly gets slain but im in time to save him and slay soarin.Later a 2rd cleric with a low druid turn-up.2 hours later said 3rd cleric messes with Soarin his druid friend tries kiting,by the time i catch-up with Soarin both 2nd and 3rd cleric have died(Druid still alive),i root and atone soarin and leave him for a shaman that i know is looking for Soarin.<br />
<br />
After being there for 8 hours GULL finally spawns but by the time i see him he is heavily engaged,the shaman gets the kill and leaves the icon.Then the ungrateful friggin 2nd Cleric ninja loots the icon,needless to say he is now on Ignore.As a consequence it is extremely unlikely that i will ever again help a fellow cleric who is hunting the same as i am.</div></div><hr />
