<br />
If you in a group and hit DB ...mob leaves ya alone (if there is someone to take it of you) and you get to heal a bit.<br />
<br />
But if you need it to escape...other classes get an invul spell to and its a great escape spell in theory.....but you can get 18 seconds of standing there like an idiot!!!!!<br />
<br />
Why??? cos you can't have spells cast on you or actially be hit by the mob but you can be STUNNED !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
This does not make sense to me ((<br />

<br />
They are best used in a group (like most of our spells).  It also gives you the chance to taunt a few critters with spells and become invulnerable while your party members are hitting the hell out of the enemies.<br />
<br />
I love the spells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">01-18-2000, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The stuns and long recast time are there to balance what is one of the most powerful abilities in the game. A level 1 cleric with DA on cannot be damaged by a level 50 NPC, for those 18 seconds at least. What other ability is comparable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">01-18-2000, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree this spell series is one of the most powerful of the game (just got Barrier, Aura sure is great).  However, I also think that being stunned should not be allowed while under either.  After all, it is ONLY 18 seconds (not even sure if its that long), then a good 15 minute wait while the spell cycles.  There are many times that this spell has saved my life, and an increasing amount of times that it doesn't because I am stunned and unable to move.<br />
<br />
I understand the slow cycle time, but the stun thing is just ridiculous.  The slow cycle time is more than sufficient to ensure this spell is not abused.  Heck, up cycle time to 20 minutes if you remove stun.  It just seems to me that with the majority of the monsters I see able to bash and swing (and inevitably stun), no stun under Divine would be fair.<br />
<br />
Fare thee well.<br />

<br />
Not only does it make the spell useless against some mobs but it doesn't make sense.  If your not getting hit, how do you get stunned.<br />
<br />
I believe that stuns were added to the game after the DA spell code was written and rather than spending the time to fix it up, they just left it in there as a “Feature”<br />

There is no bug and has been addressed in previous posts to them and it was also addressed in our petition that we sent to them a long time ago.  This is the way verant wants da/db to be.  There is no fixing just something you have to live with.  You will notice one thing in later life that the higher your ac the less likely you will get stunned.<br />
