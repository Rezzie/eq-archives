<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">08-31-2000, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen a number of posts, and even in-game tells from other new clerics who wonder what their role in a group is.<br />
<br />
I would like to give my opinion, and hopefully so will all the other great clerics here.<br />
<br />
When I first started my cleric, I had never even *grouped* with a cleric (I started on Rallos).<br />
<br />
I knew I could heal, but really from 1-20th, you can melee just fine as well.  So I did.<br />
<br />
I always buffed people, because it seemed pretty cool to me to be able to do that (I played a bard on Rallos  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ).<br />
<br />
I started with my husband (enchanter).  We struggled through Toxx (any Erudite will tell you how fun that zone is).  We moved to Qeynos, did BB for a while.<br />
<br />
I was learning after 20th that soloing was getting much tougher than it used to be, much like most of the other classes.<br />
<br />
Made some great friends at 12th in Oasis and S Ro, and always grouped with them (a shaman and a shadowknight).<br />
<br />
I started sitting more in fights, not meleeing as much as I used to.  At 25th, I'd pretty much given up on melee, but would occasionaly throw my mace around if needed.<br />
<br />
One thing that will probably be a bone of dissension - I LOVE nuking the undead.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  It's the one time I feel powerful damage-wise.  Blasting the heck out of a mummy or a hag or whatnot is something I live for.<br />
<br />
My theory?  Clerics are NOT just healers.  We don't belong sitting perpetually.  We do not just rez/heal/buff.<br />
<br />
We're an extemely versatile class when it comes down to it.  No other pure caster has armor that even remotely compares to our plate-wearing ability.  No other plate-wearing class comes close to our impressive nuking/healing ability.  We're the ultimate battle healer, if you will.<br />
<br />
We can root, nuke, heal, buff, and even do some admirable melee damage (with the right equipment of course).<br />
<br />
So our roles in groups can change to meet the needs of the group.<br />
<br />
Have grouped with most all classes and combinations of classes.  Had a great deal of fun, and made my level with a magician and his pet as nuker/tank.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Had nonstop pulling fun with several monks and a shaman.  Been nearly unbeatable with a good enchanter, a bard, and a couple tanks.<br />
<br />
Each situation lends itself to us - we just have to be flexible enough to SEE that opportunity and change to meet it.<br />
<br />
No enchanter?  Root park.  No warrior?  Take some damage yourself.  Lots of tanks, only one healer?  Learn to boss those tanks around!   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Tell them which tank to let take the damage, and tell them when to back off and let the aggro fade.<br />
<br />
Went on my first hate raid not too long ago.  I loved it!  The healers got to pick our own groups.  Has anyone ever been chucked into a group full of strangers who might be great people, but maybe not too quick?  Not used to your healing style (i.e., complete heal users, etc.)?  Learn to tell people exactly what you will be doing, what to expect, and when to pull.<br />
<br />
It breaks my heart when I hear new clerics tell about how other people tell them what to do... because I remember being in their spot.  It SUCKS.  People who insist on yelling HEAL!!!! at you when you're in control and even already casting.  <br />
<br />
We are late-bloomers - this is true.  We don't have any better heals than druids, shamen, etc. until we get complete heal.  And even then, it's not as useful as superior heal until the mid to late 40s.<br />
<br />
Our role in a group is obvious - because we basically designate who lives and dies (boy, do I have a complex or what?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif ), we need to learn to train the people we group with regularly.  They should bring regents for symbol, they should bust their butts to get an angry mob off us, they should TRUST us to keep them alive.  Our role in a group is to keep it stable, to keep it fun, to keep our groups alive.<br />
<br />
If that means you nuke, you nuke.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Root park.  Heal.  Rez.  Buff like there's no tomorrow.  And remember - everyone in your group is important, especially at higher levels when people begin to come into their own (i.e., monks, rogues, bards, rangers) and really start contributing to a good, solid group.  So keep them buffed, healthy, and you will never be without friends and a good group.<br />

<br />
Druids and Shamans have Gheal all the way up to 53... I don't see how they could be better at it till we get CH.<br />
