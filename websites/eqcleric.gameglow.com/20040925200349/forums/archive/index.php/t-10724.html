Noticible movement in 45th grouped with (who else) a 40th monk.<br />
<br />
They have about 1700 hp's, and can hit for up to about 90. Fear may work, but the Dreadlands are just insane for pops and you may not want to get a Giant, a Yeti and a Drider coming back to help<br />

The plaguebone skeletons are green to me, and the ones you mentioned. I would guess they spawn maybe 50% of the time. The other 50% are a combination of several other MOBs. Greater spurbones (low blue, or exp giving green) are pretty easy, about 2500 hp. They spawn about 40-45% of the time. I have seen two other skellies there though. One was a greater plaguebone skelly, about 3200 hp, and I was able to defeat him. The big bad momma f the camp was a wraithbone champion (red to a L37 cleric), and I went from fm to oom, and he was at around maybe a bub or so. No resists or partials on banish, so he has a LOT of HP. The cleric was interested in a res from me, so she helped me take him down. No loot except a scaled tunic.<br />
<br />
All percentages are approximate, as I haven't spent THAT much time there, but still try to be careful when hunting there.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just use the standard root/nuke. Yeah, I get beat up a bit, but it isn't too bad. Average hold time is two nukes I'd say, although one nuke is fairly common.<br />

<br />
I was at the camp with myself (48 clr, 800ish AC, 200 wis) and a 44 Paladin with a Ghoulbane.<br />
<br />
We were both full mana, buffed with Reso, AOF and Naltron. I dumped my FULL mana into Banish Undeads, with only one s heal for the Pally. The Pally did a LOH on herself, her GB was procing like mad, and the champ was down to about 2 bubs when we both died.<br />
<br />
We went back a second time, both fully buffed, with SOW and Clarity. I went totally OOM after casting my last banish, and the Paladin had already LOHed earlier in the fight. The ONLY way we defeated it was to have the Pally kite it around while I medded for a blast, banish it, pally kites, I med, then blast, etc...<br />
<br />
We ended the fight with about 200 hp between us and oom. The Champ dropped an AC12 ringmail jacket. Wow, that was SO worth it.<br />
