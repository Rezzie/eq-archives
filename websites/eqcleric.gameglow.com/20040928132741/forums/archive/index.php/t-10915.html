<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">11-11-2001, 06:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sleeper was released on my server the other day - not by us though as couldnt pull it off with 28-30 people when we tried but by an alliance with 53 people present for the kill.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as nothing else was up we went to look at the new ST today with a couple of groups - though we only did MotG/Prot and golems to the library before we called it a day. <br />
<br />
As far as I could tell the regular golems had not changed one bit while MotG/Prot had been made slowable with no other apparent change. Lootwise the golems didnt drop anything for us - and we got PA + primal 2h from the named (both rotted). <br />
<br />
Anyone else have similar or other observations about ST post patch would be great. Both wrt drops and mob behaviour/spawn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxx</div><div class="date">11-11-2001, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 day spawn time. Fairly high primal drop rate.. usually net at least 1 primal something per clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">11-12-2001, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, 1 primal per clearing would be truly sad - seeing clearing to the warders took 3 times the time it took to kill them. In particular as only some kinds of primal would be of little use really. So, a couple of questions if anyone would be kind to share what info they may have.<br />
<br />
Is primal still only from the 3 named? <br />
<br />
How is the distribution between the various kinds of primal? (2hp and 2hs just dropped too much from warder - 1hb and 2hb way too little).<br />
<br />
How many scales have you seen in how many clearings and from which mobs?<br />
<br />
Do the golems still (only) drop priceless and spells?<br />
<br />
Sofar, our count is - MotG = PA, Prot = 2hs and 20 golems = nothing.<br />

<br />
It seems they are not on the loot tables for any of the other mobs.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm?<br />

<br />
Each primal seems to be about the same in rarity with the exception of spears, those still are rare as hell for us. Rest bout the same.<br />
<br />
Reg golems - spells and priceless only.</div></div><hr />

Three clearings of the new ST:<br />

Axe Spear Spear<br />

My guilds got a few keys now, and I'm wondering how many more we need before we can make some strides into the place (hopefully before SoL).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aiien</div><div class="date">11-27-2001, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you're good, you could do it with 2 clerics, 1 warrior, 1 shaman and a few damage dealers. If it's your first time to Sleepers, and you don't have a main tank with 1500ish ac or a 60 shaman with key, you'll need more. And yes, primal 1hb still drop, so do primal bats.<br />
