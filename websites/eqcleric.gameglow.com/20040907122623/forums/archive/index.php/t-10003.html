<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radahr_Manasponge</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where to begin.<br />
<br />
So much for account security.<br />
<br />
Even though I have all the original CD Keys and cases. Even though the billing has been on MY credit card for over two years. Even though my cleric was amost level 54.<br />
<br />
My now ex-fiance has decided on a great way to screw with me.<br />
<br />
See, she played my cleric from 15ish to about 25 before deciding she didn't like the game. So, the toon that I started, that I played all those hours, is gone now. She calls VI/SOE and bull****s them, not once but TWICE, to change the password on the account that I &quot;locked her out of&quot;. She has none of the above mentioned CDkeys or cases. Just a good line of BS.<br />
<br />
So she can have the account I guess. It's already well established that letting VI/SOE know there's a problem with the ownership of an account is inviting a smacking from the Ban-stick. I also figure it'll take less time and be less painful to just create a different cleric and PL it up to 50 than to argue over the existing account.<br />
<br />
At any rate, just getting this off my chest, with a small warning to other players: Don't believe them when they tell you &quot;Oh, all you need is the original CD key yada yada yada&quot; or &quot;Talk to the suchandsuch over at this email address and all your problems will go away&quot;, because it's a line of crap. I just lost my account with a 53rd level cleric on it to a line of BS. During the THIRD call in as many days to a supposed stupidvisor at VI/SOE over this I've determined it's simpler to give up the fight. Be careful who knows what about you and your accounts. Be careful who has your username/passwords. You may not think they could/would ever mess with your accounts, but I just found out that it can happen, and even if you're in the right, you won't always win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as she hasn't changed the Birthdate, Zip Code, or Email address they had on record, you will get your password emailed to you  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Or worse, get in and start messing with the guild I just joined last week without telling them it wasn't me at the controls. I'd never be able to trust the account ever again. <br />
<br />
So if you see Aaingel running around on Bertoxx, beware.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It got all the way to Smed himself to get resolution. All I have to say is keep trying. They'll sort it all out.<br />
<br />
btw, writing a long, irate (but polite) e-mail goes a LONG way. Just don't curse and I'm willing to bet the important people read it. Remember, they're more interested in your money. I'll even bet someone at EQCS gets fired because it clearly states you need a CD key to get account access back.<br />

Then, once the characters have moved, just call her up and tell her that you deleted the characters and she can have the account.  /shrug<br />
<br />
That one seems like more fun to me.  More fun, but more expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd agree in running it up the CS totem pole as far as you can.<br />
<br />
At the very least, get the password emailed to you so you can retrieve the non-no drop items.  You may also want to consider moving the characters to a different account (though that's a fee-for-service).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mananut Bhread</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't stop until go take this as far as you can.  Personally I'd just buy another EverQuest account, talk to CS, have them move all your characters over, cancel the subscription on your old account, and then call your ex up and tell her the wonderful news.  Then she walks away with nothing.<br />
<br />
If you're a real asshole (like myself, for instance), you could attempt to report this as computer fraud to your local authorities, who could probably escalate it even further.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps she didnt agree to his getting it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
<br />
Anyway, there was no security breach, as she had the info to begin with.  Sounds to me like a power-battle going on between the two.<br />
<br />
And, no, I dont buy the fraud either  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  <br />
<br />
However, think about it.  Its all for a game.  Do you REALLY want to get all upset about a game?  And report fraud on a game? sheesh.  Be an adult. Walk away. <br />

<br />
It is a relationship issue.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if your biggest gripe is that the ex took your eq account you are well on the way to recovering.<br />

As far as u people saying no fraud going on here  you HAVE to be female  this is fraud hands down,  he has cd keys and its in his name and his credit card whats NOT fraud about her calling and changeing the account that in no way is hers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Advert</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;he has cd keys and its in his name and his credit card whats NOT fraud about her calling and changeing the account that in no way is hers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds like a fraud to me...<br />
Calling somone and asking them to change the password-code to something that you don't own or have rights to..100% sure you can get her busted for it.<br />
<br />
But then again...prolly faster just to reclaim the account and make verant aware of the problem, and have them take actions.<br />

<br />
Actually I believe the way adults do it is to sue.<br />
<br />
They don't walk away they do whatever is in their power to return to them what they believe is theirs and to destroy the other person for causing them this grief.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fizbanic</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 10:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is fraud, she was presenting herself as the owner of the account.  Period.  Ya so what she played for like 10 levels.  She has no legal right to it.<br />
<br />
Just a game? ya sure it is but what you're missing is time invested.  <br />
<br />
As what all said, keep trying and moving up the chain of command.  You will get it back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Napper</div><div class="date">06-07-2002, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two things I would really like to know before I gave my considered legal pronouncement:<br />
<br />
1. What is the story she is giving to the powers that be that seems so convincing to them.<br />
<br />
2. What this guy did (or what she alleges he did) to piss her off so badly.<br />
