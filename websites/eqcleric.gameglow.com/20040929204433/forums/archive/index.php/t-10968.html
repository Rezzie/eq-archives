<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-10-2002, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looking for a way of doing vindi with only 3 clerics, with the hps of our tanks (about 6.5k) we need approximately 5 and 4 second delay in the chain pre and post defensive - so given 6 seconds is the minimum 2 cleric chain really without right click recast exploiting (and I sometimes get a your spell has not recycled yet message when I do that), is there any way of healing the rampage damage?<br />
<br />
Only way I can think of doing it is to group with a magician in the tank group, and one of the clerics to group CH, and the magician take advantage of the heal to rapably produce rods to cover the extra mana useage of the group heal (the cast time of group CH is practically identical with haste).<br />
<br />
Are there any tricks to doing vindi with only 3 clerics?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilx</div><div class="date">07-12-2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things you might want to try:<br />
<br />
1.  Make sure clerics are at pretty close to max casting range, proximity aggro is your friend.  Be sure not to be right at the edge of casting range, or the gradual knockback of the MT could put you out of heal range.<br />
<br />
2.  Have another high AC melee engage shortly after the MT engages to eat up the first bit of Rampage<br />
<br />
3.  Start the Ch chain of with a lay hands from a paladin, they can take the hits and hopefully get a DA off, and the MT should have aggro by the time the DA wears off, and even if they die you dont lose much damage output.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer:  I've only done vindi once and it was a long time ago, so im not even sure these are valid strategies.  Just going on things that have worked vs. other high rampage mobs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">07-12-2002, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see any solution except to Torpor + 2x Druid heal your rampage tank really - and use a defensive warrior as RT. <br />
<br />
Vindi doesnt rampage a whole lot either so I think it could be doable. It obviously depends on how fast you kill him though - if its a 3 mins kill you can almost get away with not healing rampage at all  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
