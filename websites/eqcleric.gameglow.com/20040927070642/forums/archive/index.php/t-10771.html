I've found that the Plaguebone and Spurbone skelletons in the Combine Ruins near the spire / druid rings give very good exp.<br />
<br />
With a 51 pally / 47 cleric (me) team, I got a blue every 6-7 kills.  The Pally could steadily pull 1-2 skelly's and I would stay between 60-80m, and still throw the occasional DD / DoT.  <br />

I soloed them for a lot of 49-50.  The problem is running out of mana.  Generally I would pop up to the Bazaar, buy a KEI, then gate back and keep on killing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">piikaa</div><div class="date">07-22-2002, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good idea, Daeneb.  I'll do that for Solo'ing, but it isn't necessary for the team.  I had plenty of mana for nukes / roots / heals.<br />
<br />
Last night, I was there with a 51 monk / 47 monk / myself (47 cleric) and just rooted the add's &amp; CHealed when necessary.  They had more than enough damage output to take care of the MOB's.<br />
<br />
The only close call we had was the first pull, the 51 monk and I were waiting for the (then 46) monk to show and she went to pull.  She came back with a champion!  Anyway, she FD'd with 14 hp left, I DA'd and ran up the side of the mtn with the Champ enstilled.  I was 00m and 127 hp left.  Anyway, we left that one alone thereafter and focused on the Plaguebones.  It also helped that I buffed us for the rest of the evening... http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Stuff starts going light blue but most of it is still dark blue.  At 52 too many were light blue and I moved on. <br />
<br />
You can always single pull with a spell.  It helps that they are undead and so usually agro whoever is closest instead of following the normal hate list agro that live mobs follow.  Pull with dot, run and root and sit and med while the melee beat it up would be easiest duo method I think.  <br />
<br />
I loved that camp.  Have fun  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Not bad. Got 1% exp per kill solo and 1% per 1-2 with partner.<br />

<br />
Do you think this area is viable for a 45 cleric to solo who doesn't plan on melee? One that has 202 wis?<br />
<br />
TIA.</div></div><hr />
