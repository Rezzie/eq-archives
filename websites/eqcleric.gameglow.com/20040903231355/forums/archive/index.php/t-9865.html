<br />
When I got there we had 3 clerics and 1 enchanter (was only 1 cleric and 1 chanter before).  Everything was going quite well..  Got in a group, resolutioned everyone (I found symbols and SoW too expensive mana wise with the dispellers the day before).<br />
<br />
I go afk (use the little clerics room so to speak), I tell the group this and feel fairly safe that they will be ok.  After all there are 3 paladins and a druid in the group.  Get back about 90 seconds later and one of the paladins has kicked it (dispite 1 of em having LOH).<br />
<br />
I ress the paladin and CH him.  And that shall we say is the last I see of my mana bar for the next 4 hours.<br />
<br />
I was with a pretty good group, they didn't take that much damage which allowing me to just gain mana.  Then we had a call inc dracolithe.  Thats it that the warning that we had him.  I got told to DR buff but didn't magic resistance buff (didn't know he feared until it was too late).  To say we got slaughted was a bit of an understatement.  (yes we did get him to 30% though - shows what a wimp he is.)<br />
<br />
Started that fight with 60% mana for crying out loud (spent most of it feared as well).<br />
<br />
Well Started to ress people had a bard and got clarity.  Made the mistake of ressing myself when all the mana I had was 700 (as in not lose any) as the chanter who was in the zone went afk and never returned.  After the ressing one of the cleric's leaves as does the bard, so we down to 2 clerics with no way of regenerating mana but meditating.  (we did have a magician and a necro but thats about it and their mana hardly regenerates fast without clarity either).<br />
<br />
So ressing 30 odd corpses (no real multiples thank god).  Well I get put in the pulling party and I start to buff everyone.  I do one SoW and then think better of it (10 mins downtime if I did that) dispite people in the group saying need SoW.  I naltron everyone do all the resists needed and then we get a damn mob come in with dispell.  Luckily it didnt dispell us much but I lost a couple of naltrons (thats 30% mana).  So im sitting here on 30% mana deciding whether or not to buff as I know the itchy ranger puller wants to pull.  Anyhow regardless the ranger starts to kite the damn thing anyhow.  I figure what the hell and naltron the sk and druid in group and drop to 30% mana.  Half of me wants to tell the ranger just to bite the death as I aint ready.  Anyhow the ranger brings it in and we manage to kill it (through sheer luck no deaths in my group dispite lack of mana to heal).  Didn't get feared really.<br />
<br />
It drops two belts (I don't roll as I have a girdle of dilligent - I'm an AC junkie :&gt;). Then our puller gets Death Touched (first Death Touch I heard...everyone thought Cazic was broke).  Well we get a couple of mobs inc (with no enchanter it tends to rip through the casters like there is no tomorrow), we are all half dead from the fight with dracolithe.  I heal one of our guys and get summoned.  I hit DA, get it off and cazic yells<br />
<br />
ALDUR.  and he promptly death touches me.  It rips through my divine aura like a hot knife threw butter and i'm sent on my merry way to brell (was very cool :&gt;).   <br />
<br />
Anyhow camp for a bit till the camp is clear then go back in and start ressing (its not too bad really only have 6-10 people to ress from draco and the Death touches (with the mobs hitting when we all hurt as well).  What really annoyed me was that the puller wanted to go pull (was saying ill go pull if ya want just give me sln) dispite the fact that the clerics hadn't even finished ressing let alone everything else.<br />
<br />
I talked to an old friend on the hunt and he said that they had to go at that speed in order to clear zone to get at cazic.  By this time I was fed up of effectively having a wisdom of 80.  I like healing people but I hate it when I have jack chance of doing the job properly because of no mana.<br />
<br />
When it costs you bare minimum 2 minutes meditating time for one CH, let alone the thousands of mana that the rangers on the trip were guzzling in heals I felt completely useless.  Hence when a couple more clerics arrived I got a port out. <br />
<br />
So given this is probably fairly common having bugger all chanters and clerics in fear, how do other people deal with the stress of, having to do it either all yourself or with very little backup, specially when a constant pull must be maintained regardless.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be welcome</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, and, what is SoW?  Obviously a Cleric can't cast Spirit of Wolf on someone.  <br />
<br />
(Unless I'm missing some armor-SoW-specific armor)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been the only cleric in Fear for 30 people on some runs, and am frequently the only break cleric. Here is how I have dealt with it. <br />
<br />
Priority for mana on planes run is enchanter and cleric. Necros feed you on demand unless they are filling in for enchanters. Mages give you modrods on demand, druids heal you. This is non-negotiable!<br />
<br />
Delegate all second line buffs to other classes. Druids can do Resist Magic as well as you can, Necros can get Resist Disease, etc... Let the paladins do Pinzarn (at 49) and Armor of Faith (at 53). Your buff focus is on the pull team.<br />
<br />
Make sure that the druids understand they must concentrate on healing their groups instead of nuking. I have watched so many rangers die in druid-healer groups while their healers are dropping starfires on gorgons...<br />
<br />
If your goal is killing Cazic then a healthy pace is needed. But mass resses are far slower than slow pulls. The puller should be frequently camping to clear aggro, and if you have healed or buffed them between clears you need to do the same. 45 seconds of clearing aggro beats a death touch/minion callout that takes 10 minutes to recover if things go smoothly.<br />
<br />
I often clear aggro during fights, the puller and I do a camp while the tanks are taking down the mob (obviously only do this when the fight is well in hand).<br />
<br />
Rebuffing during Tentacle Tormentor / Glare Lord fights should be limited to &quot;freebie&quot; buffs such as Deepwater or Donal's armor effects. If the puller is on the ball he will try to group all the dispeller pulls into a series so mana is not wasted in buffing sessions.<br />
<br />
Obviously, heal as late as possible to maximize med time. Use your most efficient heals, including the Word series.<br />
<br />
I often ress people during battles, if they are under control. Tell the person they will be coming into a fight so they know to withdraw from the battleline to loot/med. This gives me time to recover mana during fight and gets them out of ress effects for the next set of pulls. This is a judgement call based on the situation (as an example, safe for Fetid Fiends but not for Worry Wraiths/Scarelings that aggro on medders).<br />
<br />
As you gain more experience in the planes, and as the pull team builds up confidence in you, you can take a more directive approach in the pace of the raid.<br />

Not sure why you're not getting that support if you're the only cleric there  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Generally the planes are supposed to be a group effort. Sounds like your group didn't have a Pro-group mentality, and was playing for themselves.</div></div><hr />
