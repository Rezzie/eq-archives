<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thessalian</div><div class="date">03-21-2000, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a small, very fast spawn of five Icy Orcs in the high 20s range, and one named orc (Redwind?) who is over 30, I believe. The temple is east of the river, just south of where it forks. Breaking the spawn may be tough without harmony/soothe/mez type spells. After that, it's a near-continuous spawn one at a time, and steady safe experience. Loot is sometimes FS weapons and plat. The problem with this place is that it is very remote and can only really support one group - so you may make the long journey to Everfrost just to find it camped, with nowhere else around to level unless you want to try Permafrost. I would suggest arriving early if you're with a group, or if solo you can probably get in group without too much wait. I know some people who have levelled to 30 here.</div></div><hr />
