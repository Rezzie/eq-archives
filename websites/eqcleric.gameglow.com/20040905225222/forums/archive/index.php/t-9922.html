Why is it that clerics seem to be the only class screwed by this patch?  Celestial healing/elixr was finally fixed to work the way it should have in the first place (I haven't tested yet, but the problem was in the &quot;annoying&quot; category, not &quot;critical&quot; anyway) and remedy was changed to fizzle less (not that I've noticed a problem with it since 51st level) but that's about it.  <br />
<br />
Even though it was justified the Donal's BP nerf seems rather pointless now - after the first CH you'll probably be pasted against the wall anyway with the new aggro levels.  Lessee - at a rough guess it would take about five chain-cast draughts, three ice comets, or two sunstrikes to pull that sarnak off of you after you CH a warrior in combat.  Not even the rangers can save you as weapon procs no longer aggro the mobs as much.  I guess I'll just stock up on baidaids now that skill cap was raised - until the aggro on bind wounds gets raised to compensate...<br />
<br />
And as a final insult, the kromzek scope that I went to the trouble of acquiring specifically so I could have a telescope without taking up space in my packs just got moved from ammo to ranged slot.  Nice if you need the int I suppose, but now it will go back in the pack.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Time to start a ranger I guess, or maybe a druid.<br />

Thanks for listening.  <br />

Basicly, a well timed CH didn't really seem to cause much of a problem, unless I sat down after it. Basicly, don't sit down for a few seconds and I was fine. The fun stuff was when we were fighing 2-3 things at a time, and I heal one tank, and get summoned by a MOB a different tank is fighting....<br />
Stun was still causing more agro than CH. Fun fun fun, I CH a warrior 2x in a fitht with a tree, stun the tree a few times to stop it gating, it dies. Group starts fighting a glade stalker that was mesed during the fitht, it starts summoning me and won't give up. I just rolled with it, activated my eyepatch of plunder and laid some smackdown on it. I'm just glad it wasn't another tree. =x<br />

One further note - if you are being clawed by a pissed off lizard, you need to either invuln or have the druid/shaman heal you.  Healing yourself will just get you re-summoned...<br />
