A short list or a long rant (hence the location of the post) would be fine.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I have grouped with one for some time now, and he seems to doa good job.  He pulls well (has a bow and snare), sow's the party, heals me after big fights when I'm out (and who heals themselves when they are the healer in the party), etc.  He does have fewer hit points than the warrior in the party, and two of them exchange agro (annoying, but tolerable for me), but he seems fine to me.  Are my expectations too low?  Or I am too low level to ntoice (37 at the moment).<br />
<br />
And does anyone else dislike the constant abbriviations in forums?  I nderstand in in-game chat and in the subjects of posts, but in the meat why not just spell it out?  (Well, at least the first time, like in publications.)<br />

<br />
Rangers are harder to keep alive when maintanking because they have less defensive capabilities, less hp's, and less ac (generally, uber gear obviously can mitigate this)<br />
<br />
Rangers spells, and other methods of damage aside from straight melee, increase their damage output and their 'taunt' on mobs that they are fighting, so when you have a ranger who is constantly blasting away (while it may seem cool to watch a mobs hp bar drop and say whooo... that was me that did that) once they taunt off the warrior (if there is one) they tend to bleed very rapidly, using up a lot of healing mana, with either smaller heals, or CH's that need to be cast much more frequently than on a warrior of the same level.<br />
<br />
Rangers have a line of aggro reducing spells and other means of reducing their 'hate' but the bad ones (and unfortunately, ive seen more of these than of skilled rangers) tend not to use these, using mana instead for thorning themselves instead of the MT (who should be getting hit when they arent), not snaring, not jolting, niand standing in as close as possible (getting proximity aggro as well).<br />
<br />
After numerous run ins with rangers playing in this manner, a lot of clerics get frustrated with rangers for these (and others as well) reasons.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, the same can be said for monks who don't fd when they get aggro and get pulped (and similar situations for most other classes), wizards who nuke hard and early consistently ...  for some reason rangers take the brunt of it, dunno why<br />

Seriously tho I have a friend who plays a ranger and I think I'm going to have to teach even him that Ranger Tanking does not equal faster xp. Many Rangers think this thus they Nuke alot and get the aggro..oh well...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thecklos</div><div class="date">05-22-2002, 12:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now you are to low to notice.  Rangers have fairly similar skill caps defensive/offensive to other melees up through level 40.  Post 50 rangers get a large increase to their offensive caps but only marginal increases to their defensive caps.  Also, the hitpoint differential grows much larger.  Most warriors in the high end game will have 6500hp or so, maybe 6k at the lowerside and 7k+ at the very high side.  Most rangers will have something around 4k hp's with similar buffs maybe 4500 max.<br />
<br />
Also every other melee is both a plate class melee and has a defensive cap of 250.  At lvl 60 rangers have a defensive cap of 220 and are still wearing &quot;chain&quot;.  Note the other chain melee class (rogue) has a higher defensive cap.  Rangers caps for riposte, parry, and dodge are lower as well than the rest of the melees.  <br />
<br />
Rangers can tank but imho post 50 they either need both epics (esp earthcaller) or a sham/enc in the group doing slows.  While AA does let rangers tank better ND, CS, CA, etc... they still don't tank as well as a similarly equipped and leveled war/pal/sk.  The harder mobs hit the more noticeable this becomes.  <br />

<br />
Well, I guess you'll have a few more levels to go before you really see the difference. Post-50 Rangers have Heal as best healing spell. That's 90 HPs per casting. Sure, it tops off some (barely) injured characters, but it's not going to cut it when characters have HPs ranging between 4k to 7k. Patching that up with 90 HPs per cast is a LOT of casting   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Rangers who know how to play their class are valuable. They know how to avoid agro and yet contribute significantly to the group. Not just looking at the utility spells they get, but also at the damage output they give.<br />
<br />
Bad rangers are only mana sponges. Too bad there are so many of them (apparently).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">05-28-2002, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love Rangers.  But here is the problem.<br />
<br />
Take away Jolt and the Ranger is dead in almost every encounter.<br />
<br />
They have the ability to do very decent damage and they draw aggro like a madman.<br />
<br />
They also have no defense.  They can not take hits.  I tend to believe they are the worst tanks out of all the melee/hybrid classes.  They can get some very nice gear to offset it, but so can other classes to keep them ahead.<br />
<br />
Simple problem.  Too much taunt and damage, not enough defense.<br />
<br />
Ranger + Haste - Jolt = Dead ranger</div></div><hr />

Gerenal is single pulled.  Our MA isn't patched quick enough and bites it.  Our SA was on the ball and got aggro, and called melee in.  He bite's it.  Our 3rd and 4th warrior bite it.  Several casters gets creamed.  Our 60 ranger gets aggro, tanks for 20 seconds without needing a heal, General dies.  Yup Rangers suck and can't tank to save a raid from a wipeout.<br />

<br />
How long was the General engaged before the Ranger finally became the MA?<br />
<br />
Was the General slowed by that time?<br />
<br />
Time to start dropping nukes in?<br />
<br />
Never needed a heal or never got a heal?  (Druid thinking that the Cleric will definately need help with a Ranger tanking starts spamming Heal)<br />
<br />
As a hybrid type they can take some damage and are allowed to.  Tank as well as pretty much anyother...No.  But still better than any Priest or Int Caster Class...Yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what you're saying is, that ranger got aggro, /disc swordshield, and the general died in 20 sec (just as swordshield wore off).<br />
<br />
Rogues, monks, warriors also get auto-reposte disciplines.  Those warriors didn't use theirs, probably believing (quite logically) that defensive would have been a better choice.  General isn't always a quick fight.<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like your post says &quot;I know a ranger who knows how to play well.&quot;  That's a far cry from &quot;Rangers can tank well.&quot;<br />

<br />
Secondly, I four-box 53 cleric, 53 ranger, 53 warrior, and 41 rogue every single day and have YET to cast Jolt in combat in normal XP grinding. But then again, I know how to play all four classes, and have no difficulty managing aggro. Even those LOVEly wurms in Burning Woods stay dead-pat on the tank when I slow them. <br />

I'd say start grouping with well-played rangers instead of LOIO-FM-DL-KC idiots and you'd have a better idea of what a class can do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">05-30-2002, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point was that we know Rangers that play well.  However just because they play well does not make Rangers good tanks.<br />
<br />
They can avoid agro.  They don't have to use jolt, thought it is a help.<br />
<br />
They can take damage better than a wizard, and as I said before, better than any priest class and pure caster, but they do not hold up as well as practically any of the hybrids or pure melee classes do.<br />
<br />
Rangers are awesome characters to group with and to play, but they are not the best tanks.  That is what I am getting at.<br />
<br />
To say that a Ranger stacked up against the General in Kith when the warriors and other melee didn't doesn't show that a Ranger is a better tank.  It shows a well played ranger that managed agro well enough to be the last target that could still do any tanking at all and by that time managed to last long enough to have the General slain.<br />
<br />
What ever the discipline is called, the idea got through, obviously, as you knew what he was talking about.  The idea still stands that (while what the Ranger did was smart) he would never have been able to last as the main tank the whole battle and isn't as good a tank as a Warrior or other Hybrid will be any other day.<br />
<br />
Once again.  Rangers do awesome damage, have great haste though many means, and are quite capable of assisting with all sorts of buffs and other spells.  Rangers don't have the defense, AC, and HP to stack up to the other Tanks though, and as such typically don't tank as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was the first MA on this raid.  I died.  SA died.  3rd MA and 4th MA died.  Ranger lived.  I think it was at this time that the cleric and patcher population woke up and said, 'Hey, guys, our warriors are all dead and we may bite it too...'  Subsequently, they all woke up and began doing their healing jobs.  Ranger lives because the healers FINALY WOKE UP. Thanks~  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get the log parser out.<br />
<br />
To the point, I play both a Cleric and a Ranger. I have been killed way more times by bad monks pulling poorly, druids doting Mobs to be mezed, and other characters grabbing a pop and not telling people they were afk then a ranger that got agro.<br />
<br />
Rangers pay for there mistakes by dying... alot.  Steeling agro from the main assist is a clear sign of res effect addiction, I will give them a fix after the fight.<br />
<br />
That aside there is no other class that can save an enchanters bacon like a ranger, speed, taunt, and agro generating spells can refocus an unruley mobs atention quickly.<br />
<br />
Good rangers a joy to play with, bad ones get resed after ther fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Samsara</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is kind of a funny issue because, of course there are well-played and badly-played examples in every class.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone is saying that rangers make the best tanks.  That's ludicrous.  However, it is true to say that SOME rangers are better tanks than SOME warriors just because they are better players.<br />
<br />
A number of us have had the pleasure of playing with a well-played ranger.  I heart my ranger tank.  He's super =).  I've played with him since my teens and he has consistently performed really well as our main (and sometimes ONLY) tank.  He rocks as a puller, too.<br />
<br />
Rangers tanking in Sebilis is a far cry from rangers tanking against huge boss mobs.  Even then they can do it in fast fights with weaponshield, but usually that's the warrior's domain.<br />
<br />
My point, for the original poster, is that if you're just talking about an exp group somewhere, a well-played and well-equipped ranger usually makes a darn good tank.  Not as good at taking the hits as a warrior or other plate-wearing beefy type, but they often out-damage those classes so it ALMOST balances out (not quite, since a dead player does zero damage, hehe).<br />
<br />
Enjoy your ranger friend.  Pet him and love him and heal him  =).<br />

<br />
A well played ranger(and decently equipt) can tank alot of things like Lodi(witnessed, and it wasn't a fast fight), Giant Capt in WW(was 1 of 2 clerics healing him), NToV dragon(haven't seen this but have seen the logs).  Rangers just aren't the ideal tank for taking damage(nothing can touch a warrior with defensive), but are one of the best a holding aggro(pallies can be great at this too).<br />
<br />
&quot;Steeling agro from the main assist is a clear sign of res effect addiction, I will give them a fix after the fight.&quot;  - Now, that's funny.  And I see it happen to wizzies and druids more often than rangers.<br />
