<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brother Giles</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heading to my 11th level and the Patchwork Armor is beginning to take its toll as MOBs punch harder. I am taking steps to get a Scarab Brestplate and Boots, but I have been doing well with cash. (I already have enough in the bank for my 14th level spells that I want) So over the next 3.6 levels I was wondering if I will profit enough to get better armor then the Scarab Pieces and Patchwork. (ie Banded or Bronze) I been dooing shouts for Banded but it looks like that is a lost artform. So Basicallyy the question is how much will it cost me to equip a full suit of Bronze? Where can I find it since most High levels sell it to Merchants after their hunts. Any advice would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If so, you are likely near Unrest. I would suggest heading for Dagnor's Cauldron and auctioning to buy Bronze armour. Perhaps you could even go into the edge of unrest and offer money changing services and to buy bronze.<br />
<br />
(Money changing: Offer 1 pp for 15 gp, or something like that. Many of the characters there may take you up on that offer, just to save them a run to the bank. Same with buying Ringmail, small bronze and some weapons)<br />

Anyone leaving Unrest with a full load would be happy to sell some to ya. And usally fairly cheap to boot.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most pieces 10 pp is more than enough.  The BP around 15 to 20.  Another good place to hang out is in Highhold keep near the bank.  Just auction everynow and then that you are looking to buy bronze armor pieces.  The gobblins semi frequently drop bronze armor pieces.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Increasingly I see bronze (and indeed a lot of other non-stat armor) going for 1pp per AC point. While that's less efficient for the BP it might help you in getting better prices.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check the dwarf vendor on the island in Cauldron as players often sell bronze to him (you will probably pay him more than to another player, however).<br />
<br />
Another option (if you have Kunark, that is) is to hop on the boat and ride to FV and /auction for bronze and ruined scale (it's equivalent to chainmail). Both drop commonly and most people are willing to sell them cheaply (or give them away since they only fetch a few pp at vendors)<br />
<br />
Other places with bronze drops: Lguk (if you're not KOS on live side then you should be ok), SolA/B, Dreadlands (unsafe at 11), Karnor's (unsafe at 11)<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that the bottom has fallen out of the bronze market pretty much.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
