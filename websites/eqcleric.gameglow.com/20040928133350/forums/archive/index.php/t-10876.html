<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzara</div><div class="date">07-25-2001, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone got any suggestions where a 56 Cleric and a 57 Monk can hunt together?  My husband and I have spent most of our EQ lives just hunting as a pair and would like to try to get to 60 that way.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions are greatly welcomed.  We have tried Sentient Suits in WL, but its too laggy there for us, so preferably suggestions of zones with a few less trees  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />

VERY fast exp, no runners or gaters, easy to pull singles, and can do like 4-5 at once cause they're such wimps.<br />
<br />
On singles, can ch once every 10 mobs or so, a bit more often on doubles/triples...<br />
<br />
Plus can work on shawl while there if doing it, very convenient.<br />

<br />
To be honest I think the zone is horrible broken. The risk is nill while the reward in exp is too great. Getting from 55 to 60 is no longer really anything special considering how easy VL is - I see many people duoing or soloing there. <br />

I was duoing there with a L57 monk and I was 54 and we both got xp (the only reason monky-boy was there) and I got a BCP for a friend  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Please feel free to post some more if you think of anything  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Btw, where in VL is good?  Neither my hubby or myself have been there before, so could use a few pointers  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Your puller will quickly learn to race up the maze over and over again trying to beat everyone else out for the spawns.<br />

There are some slippery slopes and pits on the higher ramps, try not to fall down (but your monk has safefall, so no real worries).<br />
