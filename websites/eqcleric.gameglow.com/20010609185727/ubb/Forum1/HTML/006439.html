</FONT><HR>Do you ever find yourself "overhealing" just to keep yourself busy?  Lately that's what I have been doing, I will cast remedy and cel.heal more and more in situations that rarely require it (there wasnt much I needed to do to assist in crowd controll either).  The othernight while in seb. I was casting those two spells on a 4700hp tank, I kept him and the rest of the group at full health the entire night. I only went oom a few times, but that was only after very long kills in which the chanter and shaman also went oom. However, later that night our paladin (who didnt seem very effective) was replaced with a monk. Our first pull with him included the two iksar necromancers. At the end of the battle I went oom, due to the fact that the monk was over aggroing, and had no magic resist -I had to cast hero on him three times (I was in my usual lazy cleric mood and didnt want to type, I will put it up after battle), and heal a great deal (I am still overhealing). After the battle I med. up, and then recieve a msg from an sk in the group saying the enchanter is getting upset do to your downtime, since normally they can do nonstop pulls in seb.  He then proceeded to teach me on how to heal properly...  <P>I obviously started to play like a good little cleric after he messaged me, and started complete healing the tank, etc.... <BR>But I decided to goto bed a bit earlier then originally planned.<P>I am not upset at him, or the enchanter, I am just curious as to weather or not you guys ever find yourself doing the same thing (opposed to playing your rogue or bard alt), if so, do you just start playing like a good little cleric, or tell the group to *** off (obviously using more tastefull words) since there aren't any other clerics available to replace you, and thus the group will fall apart.<P>---(Just a reminder, I know I was not being efficient, so I was at fault.  I am not upset at anyone in the group)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I know I'm not always 100% efficient in my groups, but I'm there to have fun as well as get exp.  I'm usually playing with RL friends, so they don't mind too much when I jump up and display my (nonexistant) hand to hand skills once in a while.  Or when I cast small heals all night instead of saving up for that well-timed complete heal.<P>Tuning to be efficient can be fun, but sometimes you have to do other things...and it is, after all, a game.  <P>I think you handled the situation correctly, though, as the other people were there to have fun too...and it appears that in their case, having fun meant constant pulls.<P>Xthor Mednheal<BR>Cleric of 44 Seasons<BR>Solace Keep<BR>Druzzil Ro<P>PS - When do I get to feel like I'm not some newbie intruding on these posts?  =) </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I've never been one to get too hung up on efficiency. I'm not a med-heal-med-heal type of cleric...normally I'm a bit more active, on my feet, stunning and rooting, nuking and even meleeing when it's called for. And I haven't gotten too many complaints about it.<P>Excuse me a moment.<P>HEY, GET OFF THAT ENCHANTER! *WHAM*WHAM*WHAM* <P>Stupid frogs, don't know enough to realize they're dead so they're up and hopping around. <P>Sorry for the interruption, but I think it makes my point.<P>One particular note I have...how active I am depends on my mana supply. Not so much because I'm concerned about efficiency, but because I know my main role is to heal. If I have a bard or enchanter pumping mana for me, then I can afford to be a lot more active. If not, then I do a lot more sitting and am more careful how I ration my mana.<P>One point I have also learned...and I wish more people would learn it...is to know when I am tired or distracted and starting to lose focus. A cleric who is asleep at the keyboard or otherwise distracted from the game is a cleric who is a danger to his group, plain and simple. This is MY big point of efficiency, the point when I say "OK, I can't do any more tonight" and call for another healer to take my spot so I can go to bed. The last thing I want is for for someone to die because I was unable to give 100% to my in-game job.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>If a group is not forcing me to work at full heal efficiency I do a few things.<P>1) Try and stay above 60m (just in case)<BR>2) Nuke/Stun/Stun Command to entertain myself<BR>3) Get a haste buff and work on my melee for the hell of it.<P>I rarely use mini-heals on tanks since they seem to get insulted.  Hell I know ogre tanks that turn blue if you CH them at higher than 1 bub health.<P>In your case I would be kind of annoyed. Since they are bugging you about your healing when really it sounds like the problem was lazy aggro-management by your melee.  A little calling the kettle black there.<P>My personal opinion is that if you don't feel like playing don't play.  Don't burnden your group or raid with a half-ass effort.  Other people end up working twice as hard to make up for it.  <P>Brambodius - Templar of Mischief</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I find myself relying on CelHealing a little too much, because it comes close to CH on a lot of people.  I also like to have CH hit at one bubble, giving me a bit of breathing room, but ruining the efficiency of the spell.<P>I was in a group in D2 with a monk that I was having to heal 3-4 times a mob.  I'd CelHeal him, then have to remedy before CelHeal finished, then CelHeal him again.  The warrior we were with just could not get the mobs on him.  I finally just bluntly told the monk he was over-aggroing, and he had to back off.  He apparently took it badly and started saying how the only way he could do that was to not attack and just sit in the corner.  I told him it was that or I would be going OOM every fight and we would be killing 2-3 mobs every ten minutes.<P>Some groups are efficient and some are not.  Something as silly as the monk in your group doing 10% more damage than a badly taunting warrior can mean you spending 300% more mana per fight.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I rarely do pick-up groups anymore, but when I do I have noticed that it'll sometimes take me a while to get used to the mix of the group.<P>For example, take these two groups, both fighting at the necrosis-guardian camp in Sebilis:<P>Group A: Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shaman, Enchanter, Me -- all mid-50s.  The Paladin was the main tank, and her gear wasn't overly spectacular, but she did an awesome job of holding the taunt.  With Shaman slow, the group's mana was good enough to pull stuff as soon as it popped for near-constant action.  And although it was really controlled, it was still enough action to be fun.  The enchanter helped a lot by going LD several times *grin*.<P>Group B: Warrior, Ranger, Rogue, Shadowknight, Enchanter, Me -- again all mid-50s.  At first I thought it would be cake with all those meleers.  But no, although the rogue did a good job of managing her aggro, the damage ended up being spread out fairly evenly across the other three.  At first I was able to keep up with buffs and healing (only barely), but then I took my fate into my hands and told them that my mana and I would love them forever if they could keep the taunt on the warrior.  The SK said ok, he'd stop taunting, and he did.  It was a beautiful thing.  But the ranger, poor guy, had uber-taunting weapons, including a snare whip, so while I'm sure he couldn't help it (at one point he was asked about it, and they were the only weapons he had), it sure frustrated the heck out of me, and we were lots less efficient, especially with no shaman.  I am totally spoiled by the ranger I regularly group with, who really knows how to manage his aggro while still doing his job, and who is blessed with good equipment.<P>What's my point?  It doesn't sound like you were really hurting for mana except in a couple of situations when anyone would probably have been (enchanter and shaman also oom).  Once the monk joined, it's possible that the fact that he couldn't ditch aggro had more to do with what the warrior was doing (or not doing) than with what the monk was doing.  At any rate, all you can really do is ask them to help you out.  They may or may not be able to really do anything about it, so you manage.<P>So sure, you adjust based on what your goal is.  As someone else said, efficiency in this particular case was what made it fun for most of the group, so you made the change.  But there are factors that you can't really control, especially in pick-up groups.  It's one of the risks you take  =).<P><P>------------------<BR>Samsara<BR>Holy Cleric of Tunare<BR>The Folk of Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Bored with castering mobs around?  /boggle<P>Casting mobs are fun because you use a couple of your stuns to prevent them ever from casting... or else you play the game of waiting until you see<P>Iksar Necromancer begins to cast a spell<P>This is my cue to whack the stun hotkey.<P>Sometimes between me and the enchanter stunning a mob doesn't ever get to hit anyone!<P>Also, over aggroing light tanks (monks, rangers, rogues) can be a frustration.  I've played with all the above that do a great job at managing aggro, but more often than not they don't.  They can end up being huge mana-sinks.  My favorite monk is one that also has a high level cleric.  He gets aggro'd on and he fd's.  My favorite ranger is a champ too at managing aggro.<P>At some point you can just put symbol and good buffs on the light tanks and start using complete heal on them too (depending on the situation).  It makes them feel really good to know you're complete healing them.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  You just have to start a wee bit earlier.<P>My ranger friend does the "beserker" emote when I let him go below 2 bubbles.  BTW: Person with a ranger getting the aggro, a good ranger -- pre-epics -- will switch to a slower weapon.  Why was he using a snare whip when he can just cast the spell?  Probably extra procs of snare were causing taunt.  My ranger buddy used to switch to swarmcaller (slow 2hs that procs a slow spell) and would take off his haste gear.  If all else failed, he'd use his ranger root on the mob and stand further back than the main tank.    <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Meleers are lazy about managing their aggro. Or else, they just don't want to.  They feel like they aren't doing their job if they aren't optimized for maximum dmg.  However, what the ijits don't think about is the downtime they're causing the group because the healer is blowing mana like mad on them.<P>I like to group with people that think about how to optimize the group, not themselves.<p>[This message has been edited by electrae (edited 06-06-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Galavant, tell Rulf he needs to stop pretending to be a paladin.  Any ranger doing that kind of baloney has an identity crisis and probably should reroll as a paladin or warrior.  <P>I play a ranger too, and while I do use a two hander from time to time (Silver Swiftblade and Nature's Wrath) to keep those skills up and for situations like fighting monsters with damage shields that don't get dispelled for some reason (the chetari in Dragon Necropolis come to mind), I wield two fast, hard-hitting weapons.<P>I also look forward to the day when my ranger turns 55 and starts doing serious damage with Archery and the Trueshot discipline.  Even now, I enjoy doing double damage on stationery targets.<P>It was a bitter pill to swallow when Kunark came out and high-level rangers could no longer tank as well as they could, but getting used to their new role of damage dealer is not difficult, and generally speaking, most EQers like well-played rangers.<P>Coincidentally, I started my cleric when there was a long stretch of ranger bashing due to the incessant whining of some rangers who couldn't deal with no longer being able to tank, and it suddenly became very difficult to find a group as a ranger, no matter how good at it I was.<P>--<BR>Riordan Bonaventure, 52nd level Vicar<BR>Jooneau Ashenbowyer, 53rd level Pathfinder</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Rangers and aggro, now that is funny.<P>I recall when Talisman, first guild on Tunare got primal weapons. The two first swords that dropped went to Rangers.<P>The weapons are 13/20 proc Avatar (100str, atk, dex buff, top melee buff out there).<P>Whole Talisman where rolling on the floor laughing when they where using them (they are good rangers but that buff is hard to taunt off (=   ) for the first times. But they managed so anyone claiming it is not possible because I only got Weapon X should read up alot more on aggro management because with the best weapons in game they did.<P>And any monk that cant control their aggro dont get any heals. Dont like it? Dont aggro so much. I even let a ranger die after warned her that I would not heal her if she overaggroed, next fight she tanked the mob to death (=. Ok, so I am evil but I also expect groupmembers to have a clue on what to do and not to do post 50 esp. when told do this and not that.<P>As for effective, I am 60, when there are one or two mobs left I go pull. Alot more fun then hitting stun etc (=. If the tanks dont have anything to hit on so are you waisting your time so go pull in another three mobs to the enchanter so he/she dont fall asleep. Besides if you die so do you got a necro to ress you with a EE. That exp in 60 got to be used for something anyway.<P>Dangrim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>If I ever get around to making a melee class again, it will likely be a bard, ranger or paladin. I just never can seem to get SKs right, I've done the warrior grind before and been incredibly bored by it, and rogues are fun but...well...I've been a rogue before and I just don't think I can ever go back to how fun that was.<P>So bard or ranger...two dual-wielding, high-aggro, lightly-armored classes. I'm thinking non-procing weapons with good ratios...e.g. Crystallized Swords or Icetooth's Claws (all 11/29). They hit decently hard and not too fast. Paladin...no dual wield, more of a true tank...Wurmslayer and the heaviest shield I can find, so I can shell out as much damage as possible.<P>That's just what I'd do, anyway.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>http://www.geocities.com/mirthandmayhem<BR>Rathe Server<P>"Judge not by size, but rather by spirit."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Wow... what a bundle of fun!  She can see all the stuff my casters never see.  I think I can now see why people complain that clerics are boring.  I've almost got her to the point she can do CR for my high level characters.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>Of course... it helps to have a couple of doting grandma's to make a young rogues early life easy. /twink /twink<P>I love light tanks.
