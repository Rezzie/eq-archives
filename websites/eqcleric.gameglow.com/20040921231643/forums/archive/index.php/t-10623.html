Guk is nice, it is.. but not as good as Ghost room with two clerics. no way. <br />
<br />
The ghost gives absurd xp. In an hour where 3 placeholders spawn though, I get about half the xp that i get in an hour when 3 Ghosts spawn. Ghost is great. Which is why you still see some lvl 45 druids doing the ghost room. They know that the xp there is great. (if you ever want to know the best xp mobs in the game for your level, ask a druid... they seem to know them all)<br />
<br />
Also, because Ive been shafted on ghost loot before, I started master looting all the ghosts. (Some master looters come down there with a bunch of bands, loot the ghosts, take the boots and lotto a band.) So.. I give up my alpha turn on all regular loot, but insist on being the master ghost looter. <br />
<br />
The thing is, I leave all the items on the ghost, then /g tell Boots or Band. Then we LOTTO the items. Whoever wins the lotto loots all the items off the ghost. This method seems to be the MOST fair ive seen. Noone ever is in doubt about what the ghost dropped. Even if someone does have their doubts because lets say boots havent dropped in 12 straight ghosts, they are more than welcome to check the ghosts loot...<br />
<br />
One other thing:<br />
When i master the ghost, it doesnt matter whether you have the boots, need the boots, or whatever. Everyone has a shot at the prizes. If a group of 3 friends are there trying to get thier tank his much needed boots, then fine, that group has a 50% shot on getting thier friend the boots each drop. But does anyone here mind being excluded from a prize lotto, because some tank or druid decides... oooh, i need boots. I'm first on boots! ? <br />
<br />
I sure do. especially if ive been waiting in room for 8 hours without boots. Look, if my guildmates or friends need boots, I direct tell them that if i win the lotto, they get my boots.<br />
<br />
Seems that nowadays, everyone has another character or a friend/guildmate who needs these camped items. So that being the case, LOTTO is definately the most FAIR method of splitting loot.<br />
<br />
If you get a group of 6 friends together, and you try to get an item for one of your friends, thats a different story, but with strangers, lotto is the only fair method. <br />
<br />

<br />
PS: I found out the hard way that about 1 in 20 ghosts drop neither the band, nor the boots. So being the master looter at that drop is a real pain because people find it very hard to believe that he didnt at least drop the band. But yes, it does happen. very rarely though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ghost is Garanel Rucksif. He is a 37ish mob who drops jagged bands, and the extremely rare drop dwarven work boots.<br />
<br />
Getting there is a little tricky for the uninitiated, and the unrest basement runners cause massive trains, so it would be best to have some unrest veteran guide you there with invisibility on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heihachi</div><div class="date">11-01-1999, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it riduculously inconvenient to lotto items every time you kill the ghost.  What I prefer to do when I get the chance is that everyone in the party who actually took the room lottos once for the start of the alpha loot order.  Then there is no confusion about who gets what and when they get it.  If they get the big one, the DWB, they fall out of the loot rotation.  No one gives a crap about the jagged bands anyway.  Additions to the group aren't added to the loot order until everyone in the original group gets their stuff, but usually they don't mind because they are still getting good xp and the party members toss jagged bands their way.</div></div><hr />

They're short, smelly, and are used to getting shafted anyways. <br />

Watchout though.. lately they've been trying to give bad deals for Adementite Epolets. If you get such an offer, laugh in their face.<br />

lower gukk (exe room, savant etc..) is awesome exp, even when some of your group members are 10 levs above u.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've mostly lived at Unrest (think I'm going to retire there) since 23rd level (about 16 levels, leaving occasionally for highkeep, cyclopses, etc.). I've never found better, safer experience than in the ghost room.<br />
<br />
I've taken part in breaking into the ghost room - it is not all THAT hard with a decent group in their 30's. Kill the stuff at the stairs (2 spawns, they go down fast and should usually give some exp), med up and invis. Go right past the big open room (torture chamber) into the hidden door/false wall. Clear this hallway/room (commonly termed the bloodpool) one spawn at a time. This is terrifyingly easy, as the first two mobs are far enough apart not to aggro when you attack.<br />
<br />
Med up, turn the corner and there will be 2 spawns beside the pool of blood itself. If one is a skelly, I typically root it to bring the other running. Anyway, use your normal spawn splitting tactics and kill these two. Procede directly thru the pool of blood (looks like lava to some), do not go around it or you will fall in a trap. <br />
<br />
Slightly down the hallway in front of an opening in the wall, there will be one spawn. Kill it. You are now looking down at a suspended walkway and a big open room. Don't go that way. Turn to your right 90 degrees and there is a little hallway. There will be one spawn in this very short hallway. Kill it.<br />
<br />
Now you are about to enter the ghost room. There will usually be two mobs in here. The ghost and one other (typically a tentacle terror or dark terror). Do NOT try to pull the ghost out of the room, you need to go in and kill him. Kill the ghost ASAP and do NOT let him get away. Stuff from that big open pit (4 or 5 very nasty spawns down there) will happily feast on  you if you do. ;-)<br />
<br />
Once you kill the ghost and his buddy in the room, settle in for easy experience. At 30, things will be dark green through red, I believe. At 35, everything but the ghost will be blue (Ghost is ALWAYS level 35, btw). At 38, I still get about a bub every 2 hours in 99% safety. To stay safe, just keep up with the spawns in the pit. If you're really good, pull stuff from the bloodpool if it is not camped. At 38, experience almost doubles by pulling the bloodpool spawns.<br />
<br />
I plan to stay there until a buffer into 39, then I'm off to see more of the world (have been most places, but not Solusek B and only barely into Lower Guk).<br />
<br />
BTW, the way Ghost group loot has always worked in every group I've been (and there have been a lot):<br />
<br />
1) Original group either randoms, uses alpha or uses join order to decide on order of ghost loot.<br />
<br />
2) Rotate ghost loot WITHOUT elimination. EVEN IF YOU GET BOOTS, you keep looting the ghost. Sometimes the same person will get a second pair, although this is EXTREMELY rare. Most people I've played with do not see bands as trivial, btw, as you can sell them for between 50 and 100 plat even on Xegony. Add in the axe and shield the ghost always drops, and that's between 65 and 115 platinum EVERY time on that ghost. Yeah, just skip me on that while I do regular loot.<br />
<br />
3) When a new person joins, they go to the bottom of the list (i.e., the 6 ghost after they join is there). Everyone gets a fair shake, you don't have to trust people to be honest about boots dropping, etc. I've only ever had one person complain - they wanted a random on every ghost. I can see how this would pay off if you join a group and can only camp for 2 hours (you might get lucky whereas you won't even get a loot otherwise), but most people I know hate that system.<br />
<br />
I've camped with friends before and it was understood if I got boots (I already had a pair), I'd hand them over to my friend. If someone else in the group got it, there's no way they'd give them (and there's no way we'd have expected them to).<br />
<br />
I like Unrest. It is rough in the early 20's and you'll probably die a lot. Once you know what you're doing, though, and espeically once you start fighting in the basement, it is a SWEET zone.<br />

<br />
I TOTALLY agree with everything Romie just said. It is tough sometimes to break the initial spawn, but if there are a few higher levels in there, they can root stuff to make sure it doesn't get away. If the ghost room has the only people in the zone (common at 8am), a fleeing MOB spells death. Also, one minor point, the only time I have seen the pit train up to the Ghost room without someone falling into the pit, is if someone stands on the ledge immediately out of the ghost room, to the left of the ladder as you face the pit, and then stand there for a couple of seconds. Other than that, the ghost room rules.<br />
<br />
I thought that a cleric at L35, I would be ready for Lower Guk, or Kith Forest, but the Ghost room gives insane experience.<br />
<br />
/em waves to Romie and friends again.<br />
