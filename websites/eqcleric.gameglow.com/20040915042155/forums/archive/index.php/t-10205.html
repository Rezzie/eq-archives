<br />
Don't you think that anyone who reads this board will know about the upcoming mods to our armour quests, and so is not going to fork out over 2.5kpp for them?<br />
<br />
And if they're that much of a status symbol, why are you trading them away?<br />
<br />
Sorry if this sounds overly harsh. I find it hard to believe you could have typed in that list of wants whilst keeping a straight face.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

You can get at least a half of a dozen RMB in the time that you can get a pair of those gloves. You dont like his deal? The STFU and back away. <br />
<br />
Frigging hate ppl that don't like what someone is selling, so its there duty to mouth off about how much of a rip off it is.<br />
<br />
Im off to the rants board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. You sound like the quest is fixed already, IT’S NOT.  Once it is fixed do you really think that they are going to make the quest easy? I don’t think so !! <br />
 <br />
2. We have no ETA on when they will fix the quests, it could be next week, it could be next June, they have already said it will take a lot more work that they anticipated.  Verant have bigger problems that us, if you read the news board all they are concerned about at the moment is Overcrowding, they have their programmer working on how to transfer players from existing over crowded servers to the New Servers.<br />
<br />
3. I’m am not expecting someone our level to buy them, but a level 50, who wants the +5 Save vs Cold to help in the next Vox Hunt.  For a level 50, 2500pp is probably only a couple of nights take.  I know that if I had to choice of a long boring sleep interrupting, work affecting camp that on average takes at least a week, or sacrificing the income from a couple of nights of play with my friends, I would be buying the gloves.<br />
<br />
4. We have no idea if the AC of the Gloves will go up, If they do, I for one will be really pissed that I sold them, and will have made a big mistake   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif.<br />
<br />
5. As for status, I have a base 90 Wis, because of this I’m wearing all the  + wis items I can get.  I look like a Vagrant Druid in a BST.  While I love the gloves, am so thrilled that I got them, would dearly like to keep them, but I feel it would be in my benefit to trade them for more functional equipment for my character to a higher level player who may have better use for them.<br />
<br />
6. Zakalwe heckling peoples sales is a really lousy thing to do, you’re a D&amp;*^ Head, just because you either (1) Don’t want the gloves, (2) are pissed because you can’t afford the gloves, or (3) have the gloves but just can’t keep your ill founded opinions to yourself, doesn’t mean that you should try and spoil things for other people.<br />
<br />
7.   The gloves are worth a couple of thousand pp today!. Right now that’s what they go for and that is what I’m asking in trade.  They might make the quest easier bringing the price down, they might put the AC up bringing the price up, they might discontinue the gloves, these things are for the person who is actually interested in them to contemplate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakalwe</div><div class="date">01-19-2000, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're both right, and I'm sorry for posting that. I too get annoyed at people on /auction or whatever denouncing someone's trades, and I apologise. After I had posted the msg I immediately wished to remove it, but of course couldn't.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Domanic, as for pt 6, they're all wrong. I'd like the gloves, but I honestly feel that they're not worth that much. *shrug* I seem to be in the minority that value things by how good they would be to me, and not by rarity - I often get screwed in trades cos of this.<br />

<br />
Pardon my surprize, just doesnt happen often.<br />
And I would like to take some of the edge and bite off of my statement.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, good luck on your deal Domanic, at least all of the rants got your trade bumped up to the top of the trade area = )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Domanic</div><div class="date">01-19-2000, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Zakalwe,<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure why you posted your original narcissistic post it but appology accepted and also sorry about the D&amp;*^ thing.<br />
<br />
I was as you might have guessed a little annoyed with you at the time.  I was over the moon when I got the gloves and I took your post a little bit too personally.<br />
