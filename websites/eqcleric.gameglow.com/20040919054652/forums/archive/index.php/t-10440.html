This information would be a big help!!!! I do not have a alot of time to devote to EQ =( does anybody have as much as they want? ) and have found it difficult to find out what quests I should be starting at what level. I have heard that some quests must be started by a certain level....is there any truth to this?<br />
Thanks in advance to all who lend thier advice.<br />

I was still getting almost a quarter bubble of experience plus 2pp and a endure disease scroll from turning in diseased grizzly pelts to Princess Caulria in Qeynos.  This is an awesome quest for teens clerics!  I would just hang out there on top of one of the bigger hills in Qeynos Hills and wait for them to spawn.  Another one for decent xp and really good money is turning in GLS's to the gypsies in NK.  I got 7 1/2pp for each one i turned in, and my total exp at lv 16 was over half a bubble for 7 GLS's.  The weapons quest that I did was for the Shining Star of Light.  It is mainly just a run around/faction quest, and you get a nice magic 6/28 weapon with an effect of cleanse.  Hope this helps.<br />

We both died after killing the corrupt guard in High Pass, because the smugglers killed us. But since you can bind in High Keep, and I could bind right there, I just came back after dieing and got the needed component off the corrupt guard. The Testament of Vanear is an awesome item, +10 wis. That and a few other wis items, gives my 16th level cleric now a 141 wisdom.</div></div><hr />
