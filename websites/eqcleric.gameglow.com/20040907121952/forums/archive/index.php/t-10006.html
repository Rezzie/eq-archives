<br />
Rumors are already flying about some nerfs on Test. Most notably Shadel Bandit ring from Extended buff Duration 3, to Summoning haste 2. There's tons of others ranging from fixing the &quot;Why did they put focus on THIS item&quot; questions to the nerf-o-matic ones where they make no sense.<br />
<br />
Several went live last night as well apparently. The Shissar Ring is now Enhancement Haste 3 instead of Improved Healing 3. And I was actually beginning to enjoy the boost to Remedy too...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/mad.gif<br />

I thought the idea with this item rollout was to give casters / priests a good start with the new focus items. I thought it would be a balancing act rather than as usual &quot;contents&quot; that we have to work our butts off to get. <br />
When I review my characters I have NO useful focus effect on any item. The only level III effect is on my enshrouded veil, that I have no use of.<br />
<br />
The shadel bandit ring was actually useful for a while, since it made buffs last longer. But I guess I have to goto NToV to get things that are actually useful.<br />
<br />
Verant should move the FBSS to NToV too perhaps, instead of putting it on an easily soloable frog.<br />

<br />
The Shissar Ring I fought so long and hard to get being changed has almost put me on the point of saying screw it, especially along with the whole &quot;shaft clerics, nothing for you ever again because we screwed up with cheal&quot; attitude.<br />
 I refuse to let 3 years of work become a cheal macro robot and am seriously tempted to shelf my cleric and go PL a wizard / rogue, hell anything but a cleric I think. Is it jsut me or has this attitude towards cleric gone on way too long? I mean they knew it was busted in original eq, when they only had to retool 70 or so zones max (about 12 realistically) if they wanted to fix it, now it's never going to happen, the whole game is designed a fundamentally flawed spell, how screwed up is that!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lynet</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the effects were just goofy.  They were reshuffled.<br />
<br />
I think that some of the reshuffled effects were not quite right either, but I don't think I can call a data entry error a nerf.  All in all most of the changes did fit the item a little better - no more int neck with healing II on it.<br />
<br />
In the process it looks like healing II and spell damage III items became very rare and hard to get.  The few tradeable level III items just had a mighty big boost in value.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for the early adaptors who sold their best items to get focus items yesterday between patches.<br />
