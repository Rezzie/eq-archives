<br />
I will now attempt to sing a tune.  I apologize if I fail to entertain.<br />
<br />
The Cleric's Life<br />
(to the tune of Kryptonite, by Three Doors Down)<br />
<br />
&quot;Hail there I know its half way around the world for you to go...<br />
But I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of Ro.&quot;<br />
I am deep in Karnors and I can not leave my group.<br />
I'm sorry there's nothing I can do.<br />
<br />
I watch the tanks pull several mobs when I am LOM <br />
After the evac I had to go back down and rez two of them. <br />
I really don't mind if that happens now and then <br />
As long as we learn something in the end.<br />
<br />
Eleven plat for peridots, these costs are so insane <br />
For gods sake all please move back out of the AE rain<br />
I'll keep you all alive if we work together through the night <br />
The Cleric's Life<br />
<br />
The Planes, Kunark and Kedge Keep, with me we can go in deep <br />
You know I'll always do all I can to never let you down <br />
More to me then just &quot;heal and med&quot;, if not for me then we'd be dead <br />
My job to keep the entire group on solid ground.<br />
<br />
If I go OOM then the pally will use Lay of Hands <br />
I'll heal and stun and give you all of the best buffs that I can<br />
I'll keep you all alive if we work together through the night <br />
The Cleric's Life<br />
<br />
The LFG tag does not always mean &quot;Free to Rez&quot; <br />
Please use assist and do not break the enchanters mez<br />
I'll keep you all alive if we work together through the night <br />
The Cleric's Life<br />

<br />
Inspired me to repost one I wrote a while back.....<br />
<br />
This is not a rant meant to pick on certain classes, just a song I wrote using my own experiences, for fun, to the tune of Billy Joel's Piano Man.<br />
<br />
It's nine o'clock on a Saturday<br />
my regular group shuffles in<br />
there's some high level peeps camping next to us<br />
Getting ready to KS D'Vinn<br />
<br />
They say, Cleric can you heal us up a bit<br />
Our shaman has yet join the fight<br />
We won't give you a donation<br />
Or any compensation<br />
And we are going to stay here all night<br />
<br />
La la la, de de da<br />
La la de de da, da da<br />
<br />
Oh patch up our wounds you're the Cleric<br />
Heal us to full tonight<br />
Cause were all in the mood for another pull<br />
And you got us ready to fight<br />
<br />
Now John is an Enchanter friend of mine<br />
He get's me my clarity for free<br />
He is quick with a mez<br />
Has a lifetime free Rez<br />
And any other buffs he asks of me<br />
<br />
He says, Cleric this Hill Giant is killing me<br />
As the red ran away from his bar<br />
So I pop off a heal<br />
As I hear his last squeal<br />
&quot;Out of range&quot;, ack! you ran a bit too far<br />
<br />
Oh, la la la, de de da<br />
La la, de de da, da da<br />
<br />
Now Paul is soloing Druid d00d<br />
Who never has time for a SOW<br />
He wont join with our group<br />
To share XP and loot<br />
He shouts TRAIN 2 ZONE, and I just raise my brow<br />
<br />
And a Necro is pulling mobs from our spawn <br />
Haven't we learned to &quot;play nice&quot; just yet?<br />
He beams an evil grin at all of us<br />
Then asks me to buff up his pet<br />
<br />
Oh patch up our wounds you're the Cleric<br />
Heal us to full tonight<br />
Cause were all in the mood for another pull<br />
And you got us ready to fight<br />
<br />
It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday<br />
And Verant gives me a smile<br />
Over 2300 in the game<br />
But they know my life's lame<br />
EQ lets me forget that for a while<br />
<br />
And the lag monster got me killed twice tonight<br />
And a train has me running to the zone<br />
But I am still exploring<br />
Till four in the morning<br />
Cause its better than playing RPG's alone<br />
<br />
Oh, la la la, de de da<br />
La la, de de da, da da<br />
<br />
Oh patch up our wounds you're the Cleric<br />
Heal us to full tonight<br />
Cause were all in the mood for another pull<br />
And you got us ready to fight<br />
<br />
