<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ealedin Shadowsbane</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read the recent BBC News Story on the cleric epic situation with some interest.  If you haven't seen it, its here:<br />
 http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2129912.stm <br />
<br />
I have a fellow guild cleric deep in the queue on Quellious and I am consideriing joining her, though I had pretty much decided I wasn't going to do the Rage madness after I went through that crap with Faydedar for my druid.  She is currently 38 on the list and is looking at Dec./Jan. for her shot at Rage and I understand the list is in the 40's now which would put me sometime in Feb/Mar if I signed up today.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else think this is complete and total insanity that has gone well beyond the bounds of how a GAME should work?  A 7 MONTH WAIT for a single encounter?  With the number of clickers in game already, is there any justification on Verant's part for choking the population of cleric epics?  Why are clerics the only class to suffer this sort of penalty - I see no Wizards standing in line, no mages, no druids, no shadowknights.  Why should the cleric class be singled out?<br />
<br />
I, for one, am fed up.  Starting today, I am contacting every online gaming publication and news source I can and will be asking them to publish coverage of this topic.  If Verant is unwilling to listen to its cleric player population, then perhaps a little public exposure will help them see the inequity of what they have put in place.  I would ask any of the rest of you waiting in line for a shot at Rage to do the same.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;list&quot; will probably be cut in half since alot of people will move over to SWG and leave EQ behind.((This may not happen but its the way things are looking))<br />
<br />
Heck you may *gasp* eventually find out how long Rage stays up before poofing after SWG comes out. ok theres only like a .00000000000000000001% chance that would happen but it could   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />

Go talk to the Wizards about Phinny then come back and say this. Albiet he is a faster spawn but he doesn't always drop thier peice. Yes there is a &quot;line&quot; waiting for him but no its not quite as long as the CLeric line. Everytime he is due to spawn at least 2~3 people log into his Lair to check.<br />

Is it a pain the ass?  Yes -).  Will it take me 7 MONTHS - HELL NO.<br />
<br />
So, I'm speaking in terms of order of magnitude - do you see any other class waiting this long for a single encounter for their epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalef Bonemender</div><div class="date">07-25-2002, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ouch, that list sure has grown!  I often wondered if i should have put my name down.  I figured it never would have stayed on Quell since its pretty much been an ffa server.  I know how you feel though, ive given up getting my epic anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwendry</div><div class="date">07-29-2002, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently got my epic thanks to the list on quellious and although a long time sat in skyfire it has to count as one of the friendliest camps in the game.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  The list as it stands at the moment is 36 people.  This makes number 36 looking at roughly 7 months wait.  A little rediculous considering how many cleric epics are around already.  <br />
<br />
Is increasing the rate our clickstick enters the game going to hurt the game?  I don't think so. Even putting it back to around 3 days would help plenty.<br />
<br />
Plenty of publicity for Verant wouldn't hurt them in the slightest and who knows maybe they may go in and change that one entry that controls rages spawn timer.<br />
<br />
May the clerics waiting on all servers look forward to less suffering in the future.<br />

Not being in one of the top guilds on the server makes me wish that I could get on a list even if it was 7 months long. I'd rather wait 7 months and be certain I got it than wait 7 days and be KSd  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

I decided to 'unjoin'.  <br />
<br />
Since then there have even been problems with people on the list respecting the rules of the list, not to mention other guilds that will swoop in and take if they really want<br />
<br />
I think Im going to wait and see what the next chapter on RF is because frankly this is a tool to improve my guild's efficiency on raids - not for my personal gain in any way since I already have the spell.<br />
<br />
It is kind of disheartening though because I LOVE my cleric and would really have liked to get the epic for her class much sooner than I think I will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ludashanus</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What if they just limit the amount of epics that are on each server. If only 300 clerics can have the water sprinkler....of course you would have the uber guilds soak up all the epics like they do with the high level treasure.<br />
<br />
Or put charges on the epic, something like 500 and there is another person you need to contact to get them recharged, but need to pay him. Like some people would goto this guy and say &quot;hey recharge my water sprinkler&quot; and the guy would say &quot;Ok that will be 100pp per charge&quot;..... one way to get rid of some of the money from EQ.<br />
<br />
The Uber Guilds would need to come up with 50,000pp just to recharge the water sprinkler....<br />

In my world, friends, life would be more challenging and everyone would eat more pie.<br />

This was back before the change and being a test server, where a 3 day span with no server drops is amazing, it was very difficult.  From start to finish it took me about a year to get my epic.<br />
<br />
We don't have a list on Test.  Pretty much any cleric that wants their epic can get it.  I'd say we have 6-7 cleric epics in our guild.<br />
<br />
Just last night we killed Ragefire for a friend's bot cleric.</div></div><hr />

Rich hinted at something in his e-mail to Candarie, and that alone would make me fine with the changes that they're making to druids.  Give them our heals, give us their easy ass epic</div></div><hr />

Why did they change the cleric epic? Here i do agree you got raped on the epic end of things. <br />
<br />
As I heard it, the main reason for the change was that when someone handed in their pearl and someone else killed Rage and looted the heart, the cleric that handed in thier Pearl lost all their epic progress and had to start over (or /petition like mad to get the pearl recreated and given to them) <br />
<br />
It also moved Ragefire to a location that was more accessable to people, so that you could get troops in place sooner and not lost him to a Nagafen pop (as happened more than once)<br />
<br />
Now, they originally said that the long spawn times were a bug and that the Skyfire Ragefire should pop with the same frequency as the one in Nagafen's lair.  However, they eventually admitted that the spawn times were set by design.  They eventually threw us the bone of having one pop about 1 day after the zone was reset, but after that, the spawn can take as much as 8 days and couple of hours (by one recent report).<br />
<br />
The no-loss-of-a-Pearl was good for the cleric, the move to Skyfire can been seen as good or bad, the change in the spawn time can only be seen as bad.  <br />
<br />
If they were counting on Nagafen pops to eat some Ragefires,  and moving him removed that chance, then I can see why they extended the spawn (keeping the numbers of cleric epic's down is a primary goal of theirs).  But clerics are NOT being treated equally to other classes - NO other class has a fixed ~1 week delay between epics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corish-MT</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not even going to start my epic (even though my guild is begging me), because frankly, it's not worth the headache, ill will, etc. involved (plus the MT server has a list that is probably close to 100 long... since RF only pops every 5-7 days, that's between 18 months and 24 months before my turn would come up anyway).<br />
<br />
RF should be a random spawn in the zone, maybe on the named worm cycle in SF, and the epic component should not drop every time (but have a chance of dropping 2 or 3 at a time).  On our server, Vox hasn't dropped one book in about a month or two, and Naggy has been just as frugal, only dropping maybe 3 books in the last month.  So it's non unheard of for epic components to be an uncommon drop.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see that nasty lizard spawn about once every day, with the epic component dropping about twice a week.  Roaming mob = FFA, frequent random spawn = better shot for everyone to get to it, random loot = possible that 2-3 clerics can get their epic drop at the same time.</div></div><hr />
