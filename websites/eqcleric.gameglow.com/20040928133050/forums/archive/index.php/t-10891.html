<br />
With 19-20 people we killed the first 2 but lost to the third and we didnt have time for a rematch. First warder was zero deaths but all clerics running on fumes for the last minute, second warder was messy with a few midfight rezzes and a very oom wizard delivering the final blow with most melee dead and clerics tanking   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
I wonder now, whats the lowest number of people you have killed each of the 3 warders withs? (including buffers)<br />
<br />
Excluding buffers I could see 2 groups kill the first warder with a bit of luck but it sure would have to be the right 12 people.<br />

They really should try to make the zone a marginal challenge for all teh loot it provides. Or dunno, guess its nice that our 'friendly competition' gets good weapons from somewhere  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Personally never really had fewer people than like 17 for first 2 and 19-20 for the third</div></div><hr />

Yep, Sleeper's is an extremely boring zone, particularly if you use AE avoidance tactics. A shame that such fine weaponry comes with such little challenge.<br />

<br />
Managed to down all 3 with 18 people on first and 19 on the second two. (Gruden was slacking and was late :P)<br />
<br />
Casualties ranged from 3-4 on each of them..so it wasnt so bad...<br />
<br />
The amusing part of it all is that we downed the 3rd the easiest /shrug.  Definatly a fun evening ... I almost don't look forward to having more people here, and losing the challenge of it all.<br />

Some of the most fun I've had in EQ was doing Queen in Chardok pre-Velious with 3 groups, Trakanon with 15 people, pre-upgrade Innoruuk with 13, Halls of Testing named with three groups, Klandicar with 11 people (and a few, umm, giants) and other similar encounters. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I doubt we'll ever see it, since unless you place these encounters in keyed dungeons with a difficult quest to enter, everyone will take 30-50 people instead of 15-25 and trivialize the encounter. There's nothing really wrong with this, but it does make things rather boring, and Verant hate 'easy' mobs, so they'd just get retuned to the point that you actually need 40-60 people.<br />

  Gruden was sleeping so he could pull an all nighter to attend his rogue's general hunt. ;&gt;<br />
<br />
  Heh, wierdest thing was watching our main tank lose little health over a minute, ch's landing around 80, with some decent spacing felt very wrong ;&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alendora</div><div class="date">09-03-2001, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first time we killed the Warders, we breezed through all three with 29 people.  We all felt so let down.  Certain guilds made Sleepers Tomb sound sooooo difficult (as they did with North ToV) and the truth is, it's not a challenge.<br />
<br />
However...I love Sleeper's Tomb.  In my opinion it's the coolest looking zone in the game.  Doing the Warders is fun, nobody hides from the AE, we all get in there and melee and screw around. On other raids like Sontalak and Vyemm you have to take everything so seriously, it's good fun to not have to be that way and still kill the dragon.<br />

<br />
Just for kicks some day, go back with 3 groups and try it without the ToVN loot and primals. It really is quite a challenge, especially when you are unsure of everytings abilities.<br />
We should have 2-3 more keys next time, I have a feeling its gona be &quot;just farming&quot; real soon.  =/<br />
<br />
I want to do ToV north also, but for now, we are +CoV faction. Wich makes it interesting playing the faction ballancing game when we kill Lendaria(sp) the keeper and sontolak, heh.<br />
