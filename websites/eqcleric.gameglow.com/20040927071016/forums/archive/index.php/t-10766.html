Is Karnor's or Velk's doable at 47+? Thank in advance =)</div></div><hr />

I would recommend getting at least 51 (and Remedy) before you venture to KC/Velks.<br />
I don't say it cant be done...in fact many do, at least in KC.<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of LGuk....I still go there at 60 just for the fun of it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif</div></div><hr />

If not Tim mountains in luclin is good. Kedege keep is good upto 52. You also have grieg's end is good if you have a group. Karnor's only if you get left moat less trains  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif fight away from water to avoid adds. I also know the grey to be good but dont go there with out EB items.</div></div><hr />

generalizing.</div></div><hr />

Frenzy is great for me at 47 for example with 3-6 in group around my level. Put two clerics in a group and one of you get the chance to play wizzie for a change, banish does  some serious damage.<br />
<br />
Some say you can solo too but I wouldnt really know about that since i very rarely solo.<br />

Works grouped or soloing depending on your mood and camp.  Even at 54, dars are still dk blue and many of the others lt blue.<br />
<br />
BTW, I never did specs or Happ either  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif.  Went through many levels in ToFS, which is also a fun place to hunt although I haven't been back there in awhile so not sure when it greens out.  Went to at least the 90% ress there on the 6th floor though so at least to 49/50ish if you have the patience to get the keys and have an inviser to help ya get through the floors that are not undead and green.</div></div><hr />
