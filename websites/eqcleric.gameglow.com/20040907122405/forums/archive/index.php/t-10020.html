<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danterin</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all. Tonight I had a really disheartening conversation with a cleric on Veeshan named Corpman. I'll post the conversation piece of the log at the end, but first want to say a couple things.<br />
<br />
When in a normal XP group with a necro that has Zevfeers Theft of Vitae you should be relieved, not angered. Zevfeers is about an 800 point group heal over time(about 48 seconds or so). A necro in an xp group can maintain their lich line and cast this spell on nearly every fight, it takes 600 or 650 mana to cast and heal the full group for 800ish health. Thats pretty impressive for a necro. No where near a cleric or even a druids healing capability but very good to keep everybody topped off allowing the cleric to concentrate on the tank and enchanter.<br />
<br />
Basically our group cleric, Corpman, rezzed a couple of his buddies out of group, bringing his mana pretty low and he asked me for a pump. When i told him no he got pissed and told the group he had to leave cause he couldn't group with a non twitching necro. Was fine by us, we traded his ass in for a 60 cleric and rolled on with out a hitch.<br />
<br />
Heres the log:<br />
<br />
[Sun Apr 28 14:59:57 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'Den can you mana pump me a hair. I will Cel Heal as you go'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:08 2002] You tell your party, 'no, i dont pump =)'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:09 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'err Dan'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:22 2002] You tell your party, 'raid prep only'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:23 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'Okies'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:32 2002] You tell your party, 'if we get in trouble i will though'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:46 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'will be too late'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:00:58 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'No worries'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:01:16 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'I need to go soon guys'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:01:44 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'can not play with a Nec that wont mana pump'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:03:29 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'may we split loot please'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:05:39 2002] Corpman tells the group, 'Been great guys. Had a Blast.. Send me a tell when Dan the no mana pumping Necro leaves'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:06:18 2002] You told corpman, 'wasnt really paying that much attention cause im talking with a friend. but your leaving because you wasted your mana on a buddy and i wont give you mine?'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:06:41 2002] Corpman tells you, 'Hey I said I would Cel you'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:07:02 2002] You told Corpman, 'its not efficient at all. not even for that ratio. i lose 400 mana to give you 150'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:07:32 2002] You told corpman, 'that makes zero sense to any intelligent person'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:08:08 2002] Corpman tells you, 'Not paying attention. You had a lot to say for not paying attention about pre raids and if we in trouble, etc'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:08:51 2002] You told Corpman, 'thats what i tell everybody that  asks for an extremely non profitable twitch.'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:09:15 2002] You told Corpman, 'if the group was low or we didnt have a chanter than i got np with it. im rarely below 50 mana'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:09:22 2002] Corpman tells you, 'Is a group man. No profit in resses or heals'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:09:28 2002] You told Corpman, 'i could have also mindwracked the next few caster mobs'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:10:00 2002] You told Corpman, 'thats 300mana per cast every minute it recycles. good spell'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:10:41 2002] You told Corpman, 'not to mention ive been keeping the group topped off with my 800point group heal over time. i think you were feeling useless actually. but np man. good luck to ya'<br />
[Sun Apr 28 15:10:48 2002] Corpman tells you, 'Dont know how to answer that. I do not know about that and dont want to sound like a total jack ass'<br />
<br />
In conclusion I would like to plead to you clerics on behalf of necros. Work with our limited heal. If you are low on mana for whatever reason say something to the group. Or send the necro a tell and ask him if he can spare some mana in some way or form. Along with Sedulous Subversion we have Mind Wrack, which is a great spell! It costs me 600 to cast on a caster mob and the entire group (including the necro) gets 300 mana over 24 seconds. Recast delay of 1 minute.<br />
<br />
Most necros get instantly offended when asked to twitch, its demeaning and makes us feel like sorry ass mages who do nothing but Mod rod and CoH =). Its an ego thing I guess. As you can see in the above log Corpman went about it the wrong way, or took it the wrong way since it was no skin off my back telling him no.<br />
<br />
I think thats about all I have to talk about. Hopefully this was informative and doesn't bring about a bunch of thoughtless flames.<br />
<br />
And Necros DO indeed twitch for raid prep times and on mobs that are immune to necro spells. Obviously we got nothing better to do during those raids.<br />

It makes life so much easier and much more efficient as a cleric.<br />
<br />
Theirs DoTs do damage to a mob and in return the necro can heal the tank or whoever is in need.<br />
<br />
I am not sure why alot of clerics think that necros are just for mana pumping.<br />
<br />
Looks like that cleric really hasn't grouped with any necros or hasn't been educated on what necros can actually do for a group.<br />

If a necro flat out told me &quot;no i wont mana dump you unless you really it&quot;, i would probly be a little upset too. I know mana dump is like the biggest insult ever as a spell, but i think you should've explained to him that you could keep the group alive and mindwrack the mobs to give him mana<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If necros want to be healers, then HEAL!  I've been in so many groups where the necro boasts what a great healer they are but they spend all their time doing damage and have no mana to heal or to pump. The cleric is doing their best but the enchanter and the MT are both in trouble.  Or the cleric is in trouble.  And what's the necro doing?  FD usually...<br />
<br />
Look, there's lots of mana exchanging in the game.  Clerics give their mana in the form of hit points to necros, shamans and mages.  They in turn can turn hitpoints into mana.  If you want to sit  for 5-10 minutes while the cleric meds so you don't have to lower yourself to being a mana pump, that's your perogitive.  You've got a great way to share out mana, turn your hit  points to mana and regen it rather fast.  If you can't see the benefit of that then you might as well play a druid, they have heals and nukes too.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that your only role should be a mana pump, but don't just refuse to do it on general principle because it is inefficient.  The group sitting around waiting for the cleric to med up -- because they are like me and don't much trust most necros claiming to be healers -- is inefficient as well.<br />
<br />
As far as was the cleric right or wrong to res someone and use his mana....  well, if it were you wanting the res would you have wanted him to use his mana to res you?  Or just tell you &quot;no, I'm grouped.  Go away.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I play my necro I don't twitch in XP groups. But I do use the group mana and health drain. If the group has plenty of healing power (say a cleric and a shaman) I may not use &quot;ghetto heals&quot; though. It all depends on the group composition. Being able to adjust to it is a necro's strength.<br />

Necro in expgroups is a clerics best friend, and I would never ask them to twitch me unless really emergency. If you low on mana just ask puller to pull a castermob and the necro will mindwack it during fight, which means exp instead of downtime, and mana to whole group. I would take a necro as backup healer instead of druid/shaman anyday. Group heal stacking with 2 singletarget heals over time at same time as damaging the mob with lifetaps is by far better then a druid.<br />
<br />
Twitch is really unefficiant. 400 mana to 150, compared to mindwrack that is (correct me if I am wrong) 600 mana for 300 to EACH groupmember and also sieves the mob.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 01:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the biggest problem is that there aren't many necros that group.<br />
<br />
Hence not many know about the various necro spells and what they can do but lich/dot/fd. I know roughly nada about necros and their spells. How about giving us some ideas/inputs on what necros can/should be doing in a normal xp group?<br />
<br />
Frankly, you both need some better communications skills  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
Perhaps if you (early on) had told in group what you told him in /tell he wouldn't have left.<br />
<br />
But leaving a group just because the nec won't dump is pretty childish imoh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vera</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 02:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think one of the reasons why necros dont group is because people dont know how useful a necro is in an exp group. Most people see them as manatwitchers and lost pets. A necro can take many forms in an expgroup. She can be the damagedealer, the crowdcontroller, the meleebuffer or the healer for example. The necro I usually group with change the way she plays due to the situation. If there is alot of adds, she helps the enchanter with mezzes, if there is extra healing needed, she goes into healing mode, or if damage is needed, a necro can outdamage alot of classes without using lots of mana or take too much aggro. With lots of melees in group the necro can boost atk and ac.<br />
<br />
Also, dont hesitate to have a necro pull for your aegroup.<br />

It seems to me, many are unaware of the variety Necro spells have. I would never ask the Necro to twitch me if I wasn't in really troubles and lom. I am confident, the Necro has leared to use his spells and knows which ones are appropriate - as I hope he is confident too that I have learned my spells and know what to do. (That's how a good group works imo)</div></div><hr />

Twitching i don't mind in an emergency but not because the cleric rezzed people outside of the group, the only one i have costs me 200 mana to give 60, so i need to cast more then once, even with necro mana regen that takes a while to regain, in some xp group i was even doing crowd control so i had to conserve mana for that, normally i don't even mem my twitch spell, have few slots as it is  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
IMHO the cleric was a bit out of line rezzing people outside group then expect to be twitched back, i would probably said no as well.<br />

<br />
1) NO I DONT PUMP, WTF<br />
<br />
2) I've got my own heals covered, mate, next mob we pull I'll heal myself and the whole group at the same time with that mana.<br />
<br />
The first response makes you sound like an ass.  The second makes you sound intelligent, and makes the cleric realize you are right.<br />
<br />
Choose your words better next time and I bet the cleric wont think you're an ass.<br />
<br />
And also, if you're a necro who doesnt pump, man, I hope you dont plan on raiding a lot of really high end encounters... frankly, the necro can do damage and that's great and we appreciate the damage, but keeping the complete heal rotation going is much more important in SOME circumstances.  If you're not ready for that, dont raid.</div></div><hr />

its kinda stoneage to have a necro doing nothing but twitching during a whole raid.<br />
<br />
Necros are very powerful when it comes to damaging mobs with lots of HP. As mana is not a problem for them, they can have a bunch of dots stacking at the mobs at same time as healing the non mt melees.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly we don't know the facts, but there are situations when clerics do need mana, and there are times when they don't.<br />
<br />
Saying necros can heal, is only fine to a point, they are great at healing minor damage, but their big group heal spell, does it over time.  Thats a healing rate of around 17 hps a second.<br />
<br />
Unless you are in a spot where basically healing isn't needed much at all, 17 damage per second by a mob is fairly low.<br />
<br />
So a necro can not primary heal in certain places.<br />
<br />
That means in places where a groups speed is determined by the clerics mana, being out of mana is a serious issue.  Most clerics I bet do not like being low on mana, its not a case that we will definitely need it, its that if something were to happen we can't do a damn thing about it.<br />
<br />
Think of it like evac mana for a wizard/druid.  They have to think really hard if they are gonna use that mana, and I bet they get nervous when they don't have it, just like clerics get nervous when they can't cover situations.  Chances are you will not get into that situation, but if you could do, you won't have the time to respond.<br />
<br />
The cleric is right, by the time you spot the problem - you won't be able to get the mana out in time, especially if what is required is a group heal (comparing word of restoration - around 150 ish hps a second, to the next best available, what the necro has).  The mana tap is useful, but firstly - you need a mob to do that on that has mana, so if you aint got any - there goes that spell, it has issues with certain buffs (its a bit flaky - very hard to explain but sometimes it causes real issues), and its not immediate.<br />
<br />
Necro mana is called more flexible because of the incredible rate at which they regain it.  Given the fact that a necro will probably have 2x the mana regen rate of a cleric, they will be able to pump the cleric for 300 more mana in the time the cleric gets back 400, almost doubling his mana regen rate until safety has been maintained.<br />
<br />
If the enchanter had 0 mana, would you refuse to give them mana, and insist that you would handle their job too?  We all know necros can mez, though not as well.<br />
<br />
Its not about efficency with the spell you use, its about mana transfer.  If I have alot of mana, and a shaman is running dry - the cleric transfers mana via healing to the shaman, it lets them do that.  Its called less downtime.<br />
<br />
The thing that ya questioning is that you felt that downtime would be less without the cleric healing for the next fight.  And for where you are, this might be applicable, but it certainly is not everywhere, and having a general, I won't twitch ever unless its an emergency policy is silly.<br />
<br />
It's like having a no heal necro policy as a cleric, after all they can heal themselves just fine.  Sometimes that just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
And you would be surprised at what happens at the other end of the spectrum, when a cleric is full of mana, and is happy they can deal with any situation, they can be very very free with their mana.  The necro can leech forever, and do efficent dot's rather than less efficent lifetaps and increase the total damage output of the group.<br />
<br />
Remember that theft of vitae is terribly inefficent if you are only healing one person, so its not a general use all the time spell. <br />
<br />
Practically any class's of similar level can outdamage a cleric, clerics mana isn't important other than maintaining the minimum required to heal, which differs greatly depending on where you are, but most clerics will not like being in a situation where they can not contend with it.   Necro's have that power to balance mana within a party, it is foolish to ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vera</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are missing the point. <br />
First of all, &quot;Saying necros can heal, is only fine to a point, they are great at healing minor damage, but their big group heal spell, does it over time. Thats a healing rate of around 17 hps a second.<br />
Unless you are in a spot where basically healing isn't needed much at all, 17 damage per second by a mob is fairly low.<br />
So a necro can not primary heal in certain places<br />
&quot;a necro does not have only ONE healing spell. The have single target healing spells aswell which stack (ie they can heal alot more then 17hp/tick)<br />
<br />
The point is that necros are not given the chance to prove what they really can do because of all the clerics that gets mad when the necro doesnt use all its mana to twitch them. Ofcourse there will be situations where the best choice a necro can make is to twitch the cleric or enchanter or whatever. For example when buffing up for a raid, its a lot more useful if the necro twitches the buffing classes then just sit and stare at a full mana bar. I just think its sucha shame to see these lfg necros as manabatteries when they have so many more abilities to &quot;share their mana&quot; then to twitch.<br />
<br />
I have several times in expgroups compared what is most mana efficient for me as cleric. Twitch from the necro or necro helping with healing. As I group with a necro almost everyday since i started my char in different exp groups in diferent dungeons it has always proved that when necro helps healing I have far more mana and far less downtime.<br />
Its pretty obvious that you never grouped with a necro if you think that all they can heal is 17 hp/ tick  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danterin</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the excellent discussion! Very rarely will a Necro ever be able to keep up as main healer in most places. This group was in Seb at the necro camp btw. However, places like Fungus Grove where even rangers can solo effectively Necros might be able to foot the healing bill on a full group.<br />
<br />
And your right when you say I should have told him in another way. I have zero communication skills, well very little anyway. Im confident he didn't know the full extent of my spells abilities and I should have told him, however I was in a very long cyber.....er conversation with a friend and kind of on auto pilot with my keyboard since the enchanter was doing a great job at crowd control.<br />
<br />
As for raids and stuff it should be every necros job to twitch twitch twitch for PREP time only or whenever else it will increase a raids speed.<br />
<br />
Dalur, thank you for moving this thread to the appropriate forum. However on most boards a rant section is generally used for flaming and whining and bitching. None of which is being done here. This is my first visit to the cleric boards so maybe you all work differently. <br />

60 Necro of Veeshan</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vera, I have grouped with necros practically throughout my entire life span, I am very well aware of precisely what they are capable of.<br />
<br />
They are a very versatile class, but even dan himself conceeds the point that in certain situations a clerics mana is important, and in others it is not.<br />
<br />
Being inflexible to this is being shortsighted.<br />
<br />
Also I refered to that single spell being 17 hps a tick, other spells (shadow bond for example) will add an additional 20 hps a tick, but at no time do they reach the ability to quickly heal damage.  All of the spells necros get are slow over time.  If you want to heal with theft of vitae, you add in 8 seconds cast time, then you get 100 hps ish on the first tick after that.  Well done, it takes a necro 14 seconds to heal 100 hps.  Yes after that the healing rate goes up, but if you need a heal quickly, a necro will not be able to supply it.<br />
<br />
And that was the point I was going to make.  In the majority of groups people do for exp now adays, you can get away without healing.  Hell I can solo blues and typically regen hps via sitting and not via healing because its more efficent to do it that way, but this is not the situation im talking about.  I'm talking about unslowed mobs that hit for hundreds of damage per swing.<br />
<br />
Slowed mobs are not what a cleric is good at, hell rumblecrush quads for 3.2k damage a round, you throw a slow in and a single cleric can happily deal with the damage.<br />
<br />
Clerics are good for when the mobs come in unslowed, people can go down very fast in deed, in exp groups.  These are the situations in which clerics dictate the rate at which groups move, those are the situations where I was talking about.<br />
<br />
The way I would have handled it if I were the cleric (obviously not going oom in the first place wouldn't of been a good thing) and lets say I just went oom, because I had to cast blessing of aegolism, just after a hard fight (lol like there is one in seb).  I would simply have stated that I was low, that if they pulled then other people would have to provide the healing, and if they killed themselves whilst doing it, id be buggered if they would get another aegolism from me for a fair while :&gt;  If they wanted to pull when I was unhappy with the mana situation on their head be it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading between the lines, here is what I think happened...<br />
<br />
A grouped cleric (maybe not full mana) rezzed a couple of friends, sending himself low on mana, probably without checking with the group first to make sure that they had no problem with the situation.<br />
<br />
Since they were friends, he might well have healed and maybe even put a buff or two on them.<br />
<br />
Then he expected the necro to follow orders and give him mana because, after all, HE'S the cleric.<br />
<br />
Is that about right?  If so, I say good riddance to the cleric.  I'll _occasionally_ rez a friend without checking with the group first if I'm running full mana, but a Cel Heal is the most I'll usually cast after that until I've regained the mana (and that's if my friend doesn't have someone who can heal/buff with him).<br />
<br />
To go LOM to rez people outside the group?  Puh-leaze.  The friends could have waited until the mana situation was better, the rezzes could have been one at a time, with some medding in between, etc.<br />
<br />
Necros have many things they can do.  One of those is to dump mana to other spellcasters.  But for clerics to expect this on demand, especially when the cleric seems to show such little regard for their own group?<br />
<br />
I don't see that as much different from shamans cannibalizing down to a half bubble of health and then demanding a heal from the cleric, or from a fighter spamming HEAL PLZ when he goes down a bubble of health.</div></div><hr />

I am now a  lvl 60 cleric have been for a year.  I was with my guild down in the hole one day.  We had a tank, shaman, chanter, necro (me), and a Rainjar. All 55+ chars, pulling near the dropoff. The main healer was supposed to be the shaman, but as it turned out I did 90% of the healing.  The tank a good rl friend said damn  nice healing  you should have been a cleric.  So the next day my cleric was born, i still play my Necro when i can't find a group.  <br />
<br />
Now back on subject<br />
<br />
  This necro should have been SHOT for not pimping errr pumping the cleric.  BUT the cleric should NEVER have endangered the group in this way.  If i where the group leader i would have kicked the cleric OUT on his rear!  Then chewed on the necro in /t's. But let's face facts, 80% of the clerics out there don't know what a necro can do.  80% of the Necros out there don't know (besides heal really good) what a cleric can do.  It's just more class dispairity, thanks to VI, and The Vison(tm).<br />

Another example is in Mist Moore without necro I need 3 more people to take piano room by myself. <br />

The &quot;no twitch unless it's an emergency&quot; is not going to work.  It's too late then.  Necros can regen mana really fast.  <br />
<br />
Does a necro have a fast enough heal they could save the enchanter on a mob that is resisting mezzes?  If you're playing in Velks and you're not likely to run into a difficult situation, then you could probably get by without a priest type.  But if you're in Chardok, HS, CT or somewhere where pulls can be a little crazy, hit points go down fast from HT's and lifetaps, I'd be really dubious of having a necro be the healer.<br />
<br />
There's a huge difference between &quot;rounding off&quot; hitpoints between fights with a slow heal and doing healing in battle when things are changing fast.<br />
<br />
As far as the cleric ressing someone, it's part of the game.  I'm sure we've all had a few times when some kindly cleric has taken a couple minutes from their exp group to res you.  I have been in groups in Kael and a steady supply of corpses have been brought to me... from other people exp groups.  <br />
<br />
How many exp groups are people in that have both a necro and a mage?  And you know something, mages hate making mod rods as much as necros hate twitching.<br />
<br />
Anyway, things to think about.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against necros, but I do dislike the attitude they adopt sometimes against twitching.  Like healing, it has a time and place.</div></div><hr />

As for raids and stuff it should be every necros job to twitch twitch twitch for PREP time only or whenever else it will increase a raids speed.<br />
<br />
<br />
It might be that you haven't gotten to harder mobs yet where you've got a cleric cheal chain going.  If that chain runs out of mana the party is over and you'd better put on your summon robe...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the necro is providing a critical role for the group, then the cleric should provide assistance, if they have mana to help them gain more mana.<br />
<br />
If the enchanter is struggling to mez and slow mobs, clerics have the power often to request that mobs are not slowed, since they can deal with alot of mobs without the need for slow, it just sucks mana from the cleric.<br />
<br />
If a magician needed mana, they mod rod alot, and a cleric CH's them.<br />
<br />
It's a simple transfer of mana.  A cleric should do all of these things when the need arises.  Refusing to do so is short sighted on the part of the cleric - as is it is in the case when the situation is reversed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The situation above, as other people have said, sounds like communications problems and a lack of knowledge about what a necro can do.<br />

Occasionally I will be in a group with another necro.  What I have problems with is them telling me to constantly use celestial heal to feed their lich.  I mean, drop a dot and use Vexing Mordinia or its equivalent instead, for goodness sakes...<br />

I'm ashamed to say that at level 58 what I know about a necro's abilities, or how to group with them, you could write on the back of a postage stamp. We only have one 50+ necro in our guild and necros never seem to be present in pick up groups I play in.<br />
<br />
So I welcome threads like this where I get the chance to learn more about other classes from their perspective. I always assume that somebody knows more about playing their class than I do. So, although Danterin recognises that perhaps he could have explained more to this cleric about the reasons he takes the stance that he does... there was also nothing stopping that cleric asking him the simple question &quot;Why?&quot; before they disbanded in a huff, having learnt nothing   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif <br />

This depressed me horribly.  How boring.  I suppose I have choosen a class where all I do is make he bars go p before people die, but at least i get to SEE the bars go up, and there is a more direct effect.  (I heal, you don't die.)<br />
<br />
I can understand why necromancers would get sick of people wanting nothing else but to have their mana pumped.  It's a great ability and I wish I could do it myself (extinguish mana fatigue... who-ho!), but it should be far from the end-all and be-all of the class.<br />
<br />
In my group we have a necromancer, and he will do this to me when I am low and he is high and we are med'ing.  I've never asked him, though, and while i would I would certainly never demand it.  His mana is just as valuable to him as mine is to me.</div></div><hr />

Clerics do nothing but press a cheal button and count, enchanters do nothing but buff, warriors do nothing but tank defensively, mages summon rods and nuke.  Druids maybe nuke, but quite often have to help out with the healing.  <br />
<br />
We become super-specialized for the end game, usually.  Necros have lots of cool new abilities with Luclin though.  They can increase attack and other neat stuff.  If you've got a guild with lots of mages making mod rods, then the necros are probably doing stuff other than twitching.<br />
<br />
A lot of times people object to the role the end game forces on them, like Seethur's complaint about cheal chains.  I have an enchanter friend that just hates raids because about all he can do in most raids is buff people.  I think being a cleric on most raids is pretty dull.  But that isn't necessarily a class problem, it's a game problem.</div></div><hr />

NO cleric should ever res others outside of their group without consent of all other players in that group.  The cleric's first duty is to that group!<br />
<br />
I play both a high level druid and a high level cleric(and recently started a necro, level 13).  One of my pet peeves is for a druid to leave the group to port someone and expect to get back in the group when the port is finished, the same thing applies to a cleric doing a res outside of the group.<br />
<br />
When corpman asked you to twitch him, you should have explained yourself instead of initially just saying &quot;No, I don't do that&quot;.<br />

I also dont think you should have posted the conversation you had with him on a message board.</div></div><hr />

IMHO, the cleric should have NEVER ress'd outside of his group.  His first duty is to the group he is in.  The cleric should never go LOM ress'ing outside of his group causing additional downtime for that group or possibly even danger to that group.<br />
<br />
I think both of you were wrong.  The cleric was wrong for ress'ing outside of the group, you were wrong for not helping the group out by helping the cleric.<br />
<br />
If you have the ability to mana pump and help his mana, you should have done so.  You can always HP/Mana convert yourself back up.  If you had mana pumped him, you would have been helping the entire group, not only the cleric.  And since you are in the group, your duties belong to that group.</div></div><hr />

The cleric wants an inefficient to cast and maintain buff while I'm playing my enchanter?  Well if it makes them happy why not, small annoyance to me as an enchanter but its no biggie.  (etc)<br />
<br />
Necros are much more versatile than just twitching, that's for sure.  If he was low on mana from a large pull I would say maybe next time compromise by twitching him a little and keeping mana for your own purposes, and perhaps if he saw how much your mana goes down in order to give him considerably less of a portion he will better understand.  <br />
<br />
But to rez his friends and then expect you to give your mana is kind of crappy.  He holding back the group like that is not right.  Rezzing one person I can see, but rezzing a couple should warrent the group get a compensation, all members.   <br />

It causes conflict everytime I've seen it bought up... so, I stay out of the battle ;p  That said, I wouldn't turn it down if offered...because its an ability the class has...and I'm properly appreciative of the offer when given. <br />
 OTOH, I've grouped with one particular necro mostly in exp groups and he was a friend (thanks Dan!) who would send me a tell checking mana... and then do it anyway if I was low. I did the same with heals for him, worked out for both us and the group... non stop pulling most of the time and rarely a death.  <br />
Before having him in groups I admit I tended to think that class could be as whiny as us...but, they could solo ;p <br />
To me,the extra healing going around Does help... especially if you need to decide whether to blow 900 mana on a group heal so the casters don't die and then still have to get a CHeal off on the MA.... or... let the casters die, CHeal the MA... and more than likely, die anyway ;p  So, yes...I've come to like the necro heals in exp groups a lot.   <br />
<br />
I also admit to being one of those clerics that will try to rez when asked, mana permitting (C3 is my new god!)  I tell the group I'd like to rez someone during down time, I tell the person bringing the corpse they may have to wait (and I mentally thank the gods that I was lucky enough to get C3 once again that night ;p) I'm finding gaining exp so hard myself, that I hate to see anyone else lose it if I can help (shrug)</div></div><hr />

Yes it takes up mana needed for the group, but kind of hard to say no to such a thing. At best, perhaps ask the friends to be patient while until you have the mana to spare for their rezzes so as not to inconvenience the group too much.<br />
<br />
The cleric should have realized however, that it's not very efficient for the necro to twitch them. If the necro wants to twitch when they hear the cleric say OOM, then sure... but I personally wouldn't ask them to sacrifice their mana for mine.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the necro could have taken the time to explain why they don't think it's worth it to twitch rather than simply saying no at first... but again, could always blame the cleric's ignorance I suppose since it should be self-explanitory.</div></div><hr />

If you can spare the mana for friend rezs fine, but don't expect the group to cover your mana loss.<br />

Part of playing a cleric (or any caster for that matter) is mana control. If you cannot control your mana use you are useless to the group.<br />
<br />
When you group, your first obligation is too that group. I have turned down rez for coin and for guildies while I was in a group. Does this make me a butthead? Maybe, but better ask the people I group with.</div></div><hr />

Anyways i think the necro should of twitched the cleric. i understand how its kind of bull**** that the cleric left the group to rez a couple friends. whats the spell for then? it's for giving a player some xp back. least you know who to ask for a rez from without burning one of those damn EE's=). if you are over 60% mana then twitch him. who gives a **** what the ratio is? your group looks like its in downtime, use the mana, just boom a couple defluxes on that eye of zomm. he asked you to twitch him. twitch him. cleric mana is important, takes down the downtime. i know you have arch lich if you have zevfeer's... can easily get it back within a half a minute or so.<br />
<br />
he isnt asking you to chaincast SC. just for one simple twitch. if this was LOM during pulls i would NOT pump, just cast MW. depends on your sittuation. play it right.</div></div><hr />
