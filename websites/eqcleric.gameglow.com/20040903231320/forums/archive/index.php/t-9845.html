<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bipplin</div><div class="date">05-14-2000, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This isn't really a rant, but it's negative in tone so I didn't want to plague the general board with it.<br />
<br />
I'm losing my love for the cleric class quickly.  It's not because of any spells we did or didn't get...not because of equipment, or other classes or anything like that.<br />
<br />
It's because of the responsibility level.  I just finally snapped tonight I guess.<br />
<br />
I used to love that about clerics.  Along with enchanters, it was ME that determined the fate of my party.  If I left, they all had to leave.  If I died, they were all screwed.  I had the best heals, etc etc etc.  You all know the story.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't like that responsibility anymore, it's getting too stressful to play the game ESPECIALLY with kunark out now.  I can't go afk for even a few moments if I need to, and if I do, I'm made to feel guilty- because without me there, the party ends.  I can't get tired and let my performance slack like I did tonight.<br />
<br />
Most of all, I can't screw up.  ONE screw up- being half a second off on timing a spell- can cost me the life of the party I'm in.<br />
<br />
Not only all of this, but it seems to me that clerics are the most criticized class of all.   It's like I'm always on performance.  I have to try my damndest to do my best when in situations with strangers or people I don't know that well, otherwise word will get out that I'm a &quot;bad cleric&quot;.  Not only do other classes criticize, but other clerics are the WORST.  I know this from experience.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I'm constantly criticizing other clerics.  Not necessarily out loud, but in my head.  We all know that we think we know the best, we are the best.  <br />
<br />
See tonight I wasn't feeling up to par.  I played anyway, and joined my guild in a dungeon.  I'll be the first to admit, I made some bad judgement calls (healing people in the wrong order, using an incorrect heal)...I didn't watch my own health (thus resulting in two deaths), and my reactions were a bit slow.  No one in my group died though (except me)...but still.<br />
<br />
If I were a warrior and I screwed up, the enchanter would yell at me and I'd be back on the right target.  As a cleric though? There is no room for error period.<br />
<br />
Am I just tired? Am I being a perfectionist?  Do I suck?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Have any of you ever felt like you'd rather just go play a rogue or something where you just hit a-1-a-2-a-rinse-repeat until something dies?<br />
<br />
I've been considering ditching my cleric lately in favor of a class that isn't held so responsible for everything.<br />

I also agree that maybe you should take a break for a few days, that helps out a lot. I have a magician I mess around with from time to time, its a wonderful change. But I always come back to my cleric.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to figure out why. There are a few reasons, really. Heres what I came up with:<br />
<br />
1) I love the responsibility. I love saving people. I love the tactics involved. I love keeping the group together. Do I make bad calls? Of course I do. Everyone does. But theres nothing better than making it through that bad pull.<br />
<br />
2) This is kinda silly, but don't think I could trust a cleric as much as people trust me. I really don't. You said that you criticized other clerics in your head. I do this as well, I think we are all guilty of it, in one way or another.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I say hang in there, the worlds not full of enough good clerics.<br />

<br />
-Virtually never at a lack of a group to join.<br />
<br />
-The joy of giving back someone HOURS of lost effort.<br />
<br />
-Satisfaction of knowing when you alone saved the party 4 times in a fight that most folks never even noticed.<br />
<br />
The cleric is the only class that faces a &quot;measured&quot; performance meter: the health bar.<br />
<br />
Noone notices the warrior who forgets to use kick for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Noone notices (much) the warrior who goes AFK mid-battle, just leaving attack on.<br />
<br />
Noone notices the bard that does not twist three songs full time.<br />
<br />
But aytime someone is below full, folks see it.  Drawn in red and grey right in front of them.<br />
<br />
And when we screw up, it's rarely an &quot;oopsy&quot; moment, but rather a cathastrophy.<br />
<br />
So it's both good and bad.  <br />
<br />
I have a necro that I call my &quot;hell wench&quot;.  Whenever the life of the cleric is at a low point(bad week, hel levels, etc), I load her up and go solo some.  I took a little time and equipped her pretty well so I have no worries except just wandering the land and killing what I like.  It makes a great way to blow off steam and just have a little fun.<br />
<br />
I suggest you get a hell character started up and so have some fun  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Take yoru mind off of clericdom for a few days  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Sometimes when I get into a slump with my Cleric, I play my Bard.  Even though she's a level 6, it's great to get away from the responsibility of saving people.<br />

And your response is always...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well when you have a cleric my level, and are put into a situation like we were just in, let me know how well you do&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not only does this shut them up, it makes them think about what they have just said.<br />
<br />
This happened to me once on an Efreeti raid.  The group was 2 paladins, 2 necros, 1 mage and me.  We didn't have a chance... the mage popped up screaming that I didn't heal him once.  I quickly corrected him and then pointed out that the slaughtered happened in approximately 2 minutes (2 lava guardians and 3 imps will do that), and then said the above statement to him.<br />
<br />
He was silent for a while, then apologized and moved on.<br />
<br />
I will always love being a cleric.  I will always hate being a cleric.  But now being lvl 51 and this being my only character, I'm keeping her... she's just who I am...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in a slump now, not a &quot;healing&quot; or &quot;strategy&quot; slump, but another one of those &quot;disgusted&quot; slumps...<br />
<br />
This is one where you're so down on the class that you just don't want to bother logging it in at all except for the occassional res for a friend or someone in trouble.<br />
<br />
Get another class to play, they're right there. I'm playing a little iksar twink, and having a ball. I go back to my cleric here and there, and I'm 51 and in kunark with my cleric and haven't died yet there, but neither has anyone else that was with me..(Except for the one chanter that decided to run into several giants during traveling and no one knew WHERE, since she went LD while running...) <br />
<br />
Clerics are still a great class in my opinion, I'm just having fun right now trying to figure out strategies for breaking camps, and the kinds of pulls I can get away with as a warrior, and it's so totally different, it's a refreshing break for a bit. I'll get back to playing my cleric sometime, and my twink is almost level 20 already.... <br />
<br />
The responsibility in my opinion is part of what makes it so difficult to be a cleric. The clerics that really stand out, live up to it very well. It wears on you after awhile. Play a cleric to 51, without breaks, it really wrecks your sense of the game. I log him on once in awhile to explore. That wakes things up. Go places you've never been. Check out a new dungeon - So what if it's green, you can still have fun finding out what's around that next bend...<br />
<br />
Or DO a dungeon. Get a group, wade through an entire dungeon, kill every mob at least once. Feels kinda decent, with or without xp, and it lends the feel that you're passing through the place, not just camping a little corner.<br />
<br />
These are some of the things that have worked for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing a warrior for a bit and not my cleric quite so much.  Now when I DO play my cleric I'm enjoying it more.  So...I guess that's what I need to continue doing.<br />
<br />
Played my cleric for awhile today just getting some experience in Sebilis and we had a blast.  I guess I just needed a break.<br />
<br />
Hope this lasts. <br />
<br />
As a side note though I think that I've learned not to be so critical of OTHER clerics.  No one is perfect, everyone screws up and after all it is just a game and not a truly life-threatening situation.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

I don't know how much other people do this, but I like to sit around a lower level area and heal and buff for an hour or two. Just seeing the happy messages I get from other players makes being a cleric worthwhile again. Then, I can go back to leveling like a madman for a while longer, else I'd probably snap too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lanse</div><div class="date">05-16-2000, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree. I'm sick and tired of EQ completely. I loved the fact that after an ENTIRE year (I played even beta..) I decided to FINALLY make a secondary character...I haven't had one until now and I think it's too late. <br />
<br />
My love for the cleric class is dwindling very fast because of the attitude everyone has. I admit, I rarely do anything other than Kunark or Planes because I have full Ethereal, but I hate how people just ooc or shout &quot;Hey, purple guy, buff me&quot;...<br />
<br />
I admit, I have had the exact same feeling as Bipplin. People always yell at ya for the smallest mistake. But that in combination with the fact that *IF* I leave /anonymous off for a few minutes, in Kunark...<br />
<br />
People will ask you to res them in Dreadlands when you're in City of Mist. Good god. These zones are HUGE!!!! How do they expect a cleric to do that? Then, of course we say &quot;no, I'm sorry I can't do it at the moment, perhaps there's another cleric there that can assist ya?=)&quot; and they get all pissy and tell you off and to the guild..then you get 10 random tells nagging at you to res their friend. =( Dismaying. Very.<br />
<br />
Sure, Cleric WAS fun. But Geez~! I've quit playing for a while AT ALL, because I'm SICK of the game and all the stress I get from it. <br />
<br />
Are we not supposed to have fun? There is a point when the cleric class becomes a chore..and I believe, for some of us...it has become that. (Of course, other people LOVE to brag about their twink lvl 50 cleric...so nowadays, us REAL clerics don't pass for crud) Pardon my language.<br />

     Most people I hunt with tend to understand when they die. Usually it is because I generally have to make a choice on &quot;who dies so the rest may live&quot; basis. These scenarios are usually when we get a bad pull and I have to heal the one that offers the best chance of the rest of the group to live. People don't like it but generally understand it when explained to them. It is a big responsibility though and I fully understand what you are saying.

P.S. As a side note. From reading the above posts and talking to other cleric friends of mine in game, do all us clerics have a bard twink? just something I noticed, it seems most of the clerics I know gravitate towards having a second character as a bard. Kinda funny and might say something about the &quot;Cleric Player&quot; and our personalities. http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

I prefer soloing (what little I can).  Or I prefer teaming with my brother, as we both know each others playing style. (we live in different states).<br />
<br />
But the clerics definitely are the ones that get blamed before anyone else... whether its our fault or not.  It can make you feel real rotten too, even though it wasn't your fault.</div></div><hr />

J/k of course but you are right we have to be at peak performance nearly all the time. We're kinda like a professional athelete, you have to come out fully prepared and be at peak performance all game long. It does get tiring after a while but having that kinda responsibilty is a great challange and makes things very interesting for our class.<br />
<br />
This whole thing reminded me of a story. Was in chardok a few weeks ago and we were in some area with a named spawn that drops the jade inlaid axe or something. We were fighting 3 mobs with one pounding on me and another hitting a pally in my group. I was too preoccupied looking out for myself and the pally's health that I didn't notice the enchanter had started losing hp's till he was already halfway down. I cast sheal instead of reso to heal him and got interrupted by the mob beating on me so the enchanter died. This pretty much started a domino affect where nearly the entire raid group was wiped out. All that for a 3 second lapse of attention. No one really blamed me for that but I felt really bad none the less. Despite some of the really bad screwups I've made in the past I still want that responsibility, mostly because like most of you pointed out I don't trust other clerics or other classes to make life saving descisions   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Cept maybe a few enchanters.<br />

<br />
If you want a clss to share the &quot;we have the burden of responsbility&quot; with...  ask your local enchanter.<br />
<br />
When you get 5 mobs attacking your group, the enchanter is usually *expected* to single handedly pick out 4 and take care of them for a few minutes, while also debuffing the pirmary target and keeping the tanks buffed and the casters with clarity.<br />
<br />

<br />
CR took 1.5 hours and 800pp on my part worth of loot to talk a 51 cleric to rez EVERYONE from the raid.  I felt so horrible I made sure everyone was rez'd and buffed and then logged.  I feel its still my fault (which I should have double checked his hitpoints every 1/100000 second) though I have been told our pullers got over-zealous and our main tanks weren't ready.<br />
<br />
Sadly though I feel as though I shouldn't attempt to lead any raids on anything due to this, so I'll sit back and heal and buff and threaten to break out an Observers staff to do some damage if the tanks won't taunt, which is a WHOLE other story....<br />

What cleric on Sol Ro wanted 800 plat in loot to help with CR?  I'm curious.<br />

If you ever wind up in that situation again, call me if I'm on.  As long as I'm not in the bottom of kedge/fear or somewhere else fairly inaccessible, I'll come help ya.<br />

I see CR as a community service.  Sure I'll take donations if offered, but my standard response is &quot;let's get everyone back on their feet, that's the most important thing, we'll sort out everything else later&quot;.  If they want to throw an item or plat my way by choice, so be it.  If they just want to say thanks, I'm happy with that too.<br />

However, maybe I have been lucky just being on a great server, but I don't recall ever being criticized for my healing abilities. Believe me, I have had off days, and I have made my share of errors, and I have gotten people killed. Still, my (pick up) group members shake it off with a 'it happens'.<br />
We are our own worst critics. Don't take the failures so hard. You can't save everyone all the time. And so on. <br />
<br />
The fact that you DO take it hard in itself proves you are a good cleric. <br />
Anyone can cultivate good strategy, but sincere concern for others is not so easily achieved.<br />
If you care about people and you can learn from your mistakes, don't sweat it. You will make many more mistakes in time to come. And have your share of successes.<br />

P.S. By the way, success does not have to be on the level of a Miracle.<br />

My group is very understanding - and typically no one dies unless everyone is oom and the tanks are at 10% health.<br />
<br />
But mistakes happen.. It's the same way in my group.  My husband is an enchanter, and I swear the guys are so spoiled now they won't go anywhere without us.  Which bites if I want to play my bard (who I'm finally having fun with again).<br />

Don't be too hard on yourself.  Sheep happens and you gotta just shake it off and continue.<br />
<br />
Something fun to do?  Get your group and go to a dungeon that's uncamped and very low level.  Beat the tar out of it.  Kill everything twice.  Melee stuff.  Have a helluva lot of fun (we did Dalnir's last night).  Laugh.  It really makes a difference when it's not a huge painful push for experience, but instead a little exploring and group bonding.</div></div><hr />

And for the offer, between you and Tiganos coming to save the day all the time I may just have to vote that Sol Ro has the nicest clerics around.  I'll look you up when we need the help =)<br />
