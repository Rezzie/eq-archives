I think heaven we have this board to be able to help each other when the going gets tough  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif  In short I am literally exausted Trying to kill  Klandicar but its one of the Brood that we can get forces to b4 other interested parties get to him.  I sit back and look at our guild make up and think that we are capable.  Maybe I am asking too much for the guild composition that I have?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif  <br />
<br />
Accomplishments so far are Kunark Dragons,Vindi,Doomshade,Velketor, Dain, Rumble-Crush, Servitor, Inny, Zlandicar,Va'dyn,Restless,  XI and that about sums it up.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/eek.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
We are a 60+ raiding guild and last attempt we had:<br />
<br />
6 clerics<br />
2 shamy<br />
4 druids<br />
2 Paly<br />
6 Warrior<br />
2 ranger<br />
2 SK<br />
2 rogues<br />
3 Monks<br />
1 BST<br />
2 bards<br />
2 Paly<br />
4 wizzy<br />
2 mages<br />
2 necro<br />
2 enchanters<br />
<br />
44 Total<br />
<br />
Both our MT and SA have 6500 HP buffed with 40 + AA.  The bards we have now are 55,and 57 with rest being 60 varying between 10 - 60 AAs roughly.  Normal raid procedures Take place with Maxing DS on Main Tanks, Buffing, clicky devices etc. 100 + to resists min. http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
We tried initiating the fight with MT out front and everyone else Midways to rear of Klandi.  We got wiped 3 times. http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif  Then we thought what the heck have bard Kite and we will Tash,Malo,Cripple,Slow on the fly. http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/confused.gif  We tried this and after each landed there debuff they zoned to clear agro at DN.  Bard Brings Klandicar to stage spot and MT stays up but most of the other melee take alot of AE dmg and get killed due to low health agro.  Then Priests die and its Over quick. http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/redface.gif  Is there some tactic that we should try thats going to get us past this roadblock? Do we need to do the seemingly impossible and have 10-12 clerics for this fight? http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/confused.gif  Any help would be greatly appreciated to say the least! http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
What we sometimes do is have a couple of groups debuff group, We have 2 clerics chain heal a ranger who weapon shields.  The reason why you use a ranger is that otherwise the clerics get eaten, ae taunt from a warrior would help here, but im guessing you don't have that.  Then its just a case of hold out until a slow lands (which rangers often get as well :&gt;) and then when slow lands everyone in and its really rather easy from then on.<br />
<br />
Or you could use the other method of zerging and hoping a slow hits before ya run out of people :&gt;<br />
<br />
Get the slow in and klandicar falls fairly easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just recently deguilded from a guild that only started killing Klandi a few months ago with on roughly 35 people with half as many warriors as what you have listed and same amount of clerics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry thats not of much help strat wise but I just treated the fight like any other dragon fight where you cant hide from the aoe's pretty much textbook stuff  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Just have 3 clerics doing this on MT, and all th eother clerics split up between groups and healing people with elix/ch. His HP isnt high at all, make sure your melees disc early. Once he gets slowed (isnt hard with tash/oos/malo), 1 cleric can heal MT, rest can heal vs AE till the mob is dead. He isnt too tough of a mob, though if you lack DPS its a lot harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering you already had him slowed when you engaged this particular time, it looks like the healers of the groups dropped the ball on this example. His AE isnt *that* bad. As long as everyone has an insta-clicker, you can keep everyone alive with CE.<br />
<br />
Our last Kland kill, we only had 4 clerics, 1 of which was 2-boxed. Just had a pally DA and pull him to us, MT engage, clerics spam DL to MT and other healers heal as well. We usually get slow in within the first minute and he's absolute cake from there.<br />
<br />
Did you guys have designated tanks taking rampage damage? If a cleric gets on rampage before slow is in, he's gonna end up dead<br />

 <br />
  Either your healers weren't or you have really really low damage output, probably from lack of levels, so the fight lasted forever.  Klandi usually dies before anyone other than the MT even needs healed, especially with spellshields on everyone.  If the 4 wizards have manaburn they can toss a few nukes, step out of AE, eat a rod, harvest, then burn and have done 40%+ of his life just by themselves.</div></div><hr />

***********SPOILER************<br />
<br />
Enter DN. Make groups.<br />
<br />
MT group<br />
3 clerics -&gt; CH rotation @ pause 35<br />
MT, backup MT<br />
Bard<br />
<br />
Form the rest of your groups around clerics, paladins, shamans, and druids, so everyone has some source of healing.<br />
<br />
Equip MR gear (AE damage is fairly unresistable) then HP gear.<br />
<br />
Right click items go up top of the buff order (if jboots, zone out to click them). Buff everyone with Focus, STA, Aego, GMR, haste or KEI as appropriate, BMB, CotP. Add regen too for good measure if you desire.<br />
<br />
When buffed, exit DN.<br />
<br />
If you have a +CoV druid or ranger, harmony Klandicar and set up in a circle around him; otherwise you'll have to charge him.<br />
<br />
Start of fight - all healers target MT, everyone else targets Kland and has their finger on their clicky item hotkey.<br />
<br />
MT attacks, first AE hits. Everyone hits their clicky. <br />
<br />
CH rotation starts, all other healers spam heal (DL, chloroblast) the MT until the rotation kicks in... so for 10 sec. MT group bard has a DS going on MT, other bard is singing MR. <br />
<br />
Debuffing should start after about 10 seconds since your MT will likely need time to build sufficient aggro. At the same time, everyone else attacks Kland.<br />
<br />
From here just keep the MT alive. When AE goes off, everyone hits their clicky to stay buffed. Clerics group heal their groups, paladins use their wave spells (perfect for AE dragons), druids and shamans have to do it with torpor and chloroblast.<br />
<br />
Follow these instructions and you'll never lose another Kland fight again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is what we do.<br />
<br />
We have our force sit up against the wall. We get 4 crap buffs before we start any other buffs. This is important.<br />
<br />
We have the enchanter tash him and then run into DN. After he wanders back to his spot we have our shaman Malo him and zone into DN. After he returns to the spot and the debuffers are back at the group we go down and the clerics rolling heal the MT at 4 second intervals until the shaman/enchanters are able to get him slowed. We always try and put a secondary healer in each group as well as the cleric. Druid, Shaman, Pally.  It helps the clerics to be able to watch the MTs health and not use all their mana healing their own group.<br />
<br />
Bard AOE resist song is a huge plus in this battle as well. You wont resist the AOE damage but it helps to resist the fear so you will keep more consistent damage on the mob and the clerics wont get interuppted as much.<br />
<br />
We have done this fight with 24 people and 2 clerics and won. So you definately have the force to do it. Good luck!<br />

<br />
We do it with 2 or 3 clerics usually.  THE MAIN TANK NEVER DIES.  <br />
<br />
Really, there is not much strategy.  Form groups, cleric or druid or shaman in each group for heals, paladins use their LoH's, very easy kill.<br />

Think today we took him out with 18?  /shrug</div></div><hr />

My guild has never used ch rotation on him(his fear fecks that up)<br />
<br />
For the healing we just spam the tank with DL and occasional CH, and use group ch for keeping the group alive.  we even had 2 clerics on him at one time.<br />
<br />
He is always a fun fight, because its so easy  to mess this fight up  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Slowing Klandicar, as Aldur said get your bards equipped with tash gear, helps tremendously. You want to try and get a malosini on him after malo (its a better debuff but isnt irresistable) you also want the highest level chanter tash, the level 57 one. So enc tash, malo, malosini, occlusion of sound, bard tash. <br />
<br />
Tried the debuff and run away strat when we started doing him and it was all too annoying. Keep the MT alive whilst your debuff team goes to town, communicate to each other whats landed, if he isnt slowed in the first couple of moments then go for it anyway, hesitation will kill a Kland raid.<br />
<br />
You could try the void method, personally I'd leave voiding unless dessperate until your debuff team is working together like clockwork, the disc doesnt last very long and leaves little margin for error.<br />

<br />
We normally DL or remedy our way through, towards the end WoR is an easy way to save everyone in your grp from dying.<br />
<br />
Just make sure first remedy/DL hits MT after kland has cast his first AE, and MT has struck first blow or your gonna be dead before you can say &quot;dragon soup&quot;<br />
<br />
3 cleric doable, easy.<br />
