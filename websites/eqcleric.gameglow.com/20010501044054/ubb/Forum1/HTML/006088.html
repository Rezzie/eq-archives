</FONT><HR>Found this at Everlore...<P>Its interesting. Coming from a non uber, once a month( if lucky) plane running guild.. We have fun by ourselves, we dont need a 80 man guild where people know other people because they are there to help you get items. We are there for each other and have a blast playing EQ.What do you guys think about this?<P>I’ve played EverQuest for over two years now. I’ve beta tested. I’ve role-played. I’ve adventured. I’ve leveled, and I’ve gone for the epics. Although the game still holds me closely to it’s bosom after all of this time, I have found that perhaps players have lost a sense of morality and honor. Is this the “phat lewt” fever? Perhaps. Perhaps not. <BR>Players today are driven by one hope, and that is to “beat” EverQuest. Why beat it? There is no end-goal other than perhaps reaching level 60 and owning the best equipment available to one’s class and/or race. These players are so driven by their lust for “lewt” that they have become monsters to their former friends and guilds. They rush to battles one after the other… Gorenaire in the Dreadlands… Trakanon in Old Sebilis… and of course, the famed “hot spot” Ragefire in Nagafen’s Lair… all for loot. Morality stops here. Care for those who have spent hours attempting to kill a specific mob has been laid to waste by larger guilds with loot hungry minds that rush in at the last second to “steal” something that smaller guilds worked very hard to achieve. GMs? What are those? Are they creatures I create for my children’s fairy tales? They know not of the situations that occur behind their backs. <P>Oh, it is true that many larger guilds are quite noble, though there are some, unnamed by me, that strive to crush those that get in their way. These guilds, once friends of many, grew, changed, but allowed their morals and honor to deteriorate as they progressed in the game. They no longer desire to be friendly and respectable of the trials and torture that smaller, lower-level guilds have to go through to make it to the top of the server food chain; they only desire their loot. <P>Take the epic quests for example. They are meant to be epic in every way, shape, and form. Players unite to gather the items for these wonderful weapons, though the end always seems to trip them. Guilds fight over something as trivial as Ragefire, for example. A mob, which spawns every 0 to 90 hours (variable spawn time), is the last part needed to complete the cleric epic quest. Every 90 hours, GMs have to deal with fights between as many as four guilds over this bundle of 1’s and 0’s in a virtual world. Is this epic? Is this what Verant really wants us to go through when attempting to complete our quests? Petty arguments ensue between guilds over these items… over loot. Is there honor left in EverQuest? Maybe… I hope and dream that it remains. <P>There are some, who allow themselves to be walked all over, so they don’t end up stooping to the record low of many guilds. This isn’t meant to be an attack upon those who run from uber spawn to uber spawn hoping for their lovely “phat lewtz;” rather, a question to the general public regarding honor and morality left in the game today. How do we see ourselves in the game today? How will we be tomorrow? Do we see ourselves as being the best of the best and allowed to trample over those who are not as “uber?” Or are we honorable beings? These things and more I am curious to hear about. I want to know, WHAT drives players to drop all respect, morality, and integrity, to obtain one piece of loot. Moreover, what of honor? <P>Georgia Gaelicmyst [Fennin Ro]<BR>Everlore Staff Member <BR><p>[This message has been edited by Disturbed (edited 04-23-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Absolutely amazing.  I don't think I could have written it better.<P>I run a guild on Thlouxe Paells.  Those of you there have no doubt heard of us - The Avengers Federation.  We also have divisions on Erollisi Marr, The Nameless, and Sol Ro.  I do not run those divisions, but we all work in the same, I just take different leadership visions of the guild than the others (which is fine) - But my thoughts I'm going to post below are mine and reflect the AF on Thlouxe Paells, not necessarily the other divisions.  (Just needed to say that!)<P>My guild consists of a few of us in our 50s, a lot in the 40s, and many others from level 4 to the 30s.  Whether you are level 4 or level 60, you're a human being sitting on a chair playing a game.  What defines honor and moral is respect to the person?  I get asked often "Damn aladain, you need some better stuff".  Whats that mean?  Anyone thats been in a group with me knows that not only am I a damn damn damn good cleric, but I am a VERY respectful person, and bring a lot of charming personality to the groups I'm in.  How do I improve on that with better loot?   I want people to like me, and respect me for me, not what I've got on my back.<P>In my guild, we too raid "here and there" but its not the reason we're around.  We exist because of the people in the guild.  We exist to make ourselves, AND others happy to be around good people.  If anyone in my guild gets too self-centered about loot, or causes a "Poor-taste" argument about loot, they are not welcome.  Loot is loot, and disagreements are fine, but as long as its reasonable.  If someone wants to leave us because "I can't do XXX with you guys" so be it.  They are good people, yes, but I don't want people in my guild that are not happy.  If someone is sad because we can't up and go kill Trakanon, then our guild isn't for them.<P>As of current, I have a lot of 50+ players in the AF (I think 7-8 which to me at least, it a lot).  But, instead of being in a big guild, OR guild "Alliances" - we have a large number of people - numbering up to 100-120.  They are in different small guilds.  Some are in no guilds.  And we're doing planes fine.  We'll move to harder stuff later as well.  We want to give everyone a chance to get nice stuff, but its not for "getting nice stuff" - its for the experence to do it with GOOD people.  With low low (Character) self-esteem some people have in their equipment - I have little sympathy for them.  Want to know how to get sympathy from me?  DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  Do what Spiritlance, Chronicus and Waggs do on Thlouxe Paells (BIG BIG Kudos to those 3).  Get these other people together, and make it happen.  Get off your ass and make it happen.  Waggs gets beat to death on experence (He has lost almost all of 53 on these raids, and I think hes ate 1 res).  The guy doesnt care, though, hes making others happy, and that satisfies him.<P>Powergamers will always have a place, and I too respect them - I do not respect someone being a "better person" because they dont have a_uber_item01.<P>Aladain</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am an officer in my guild and surprisingly alot of people listen to what I have to say <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> (quite in the peanut gallery) and when it comes to people in the guild this is my take on it. In real life we do not judge our friends by the jobs they do nor the proficiency in which they do it so why would I judge my EQ friends that way as well. Any monkey can push buttons to get to level 60, but it's your friends that make the game and it's because of my friends that I have even played this long. Equipment I view in the same way, I'm not friends with someone because they have a fast car, the one they have gets the job done and as long as they are happy it's all that matters. If I happen to get something in game that they can use it's theirs no questions asked no payment wanted because their friendship means more to me than 1's and 0's. <P>Eventually a new game will come out and no one will remember what PH@T L33WTZ you had. They will remember that time in befallen when you were all level 15, or that time in Splitpaw where you got the heal off just in time to save the tank. Your first dragon raid, that newbie you helped out to buy spells who remembered you and said hi 30 levels later, that whacky cleric from the boards who swore by his hand to hand skills <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> When all is said and done and the last person has logged off of everquest and the servers are shut down and all your uber equipment is gone for good the only thing you will be remembered for, is you and how you treated everyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>First off great post.. People on Prexus are seeing some of the things you mention, and our guild is very disturbed by the taking over of the rare spawns by a few uber guilds.  We heard of a recent fear raid that was taken over by a large guild,  from a small guild that had it on the servers event calendar, simply because they wanted to kill Cazic. <BR>My guild, "Shining Alliance" was very disappointed by this action of the uber guild.. Hopefully this action won't be repeated, but I have the suspicion that this kind of thing may have just begun.. <BR>Dusklar  .. non twinked cleric of 59 levels.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>OI... you're copying my article over here :P<P>I've actually gotten some really good responses from people, even those in uber guilds  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>It was basically written in response to a few things that I've witnessed over the past month that have really ticked me off. I honestly believe that Honor and Civility have left this game at the level 50+ game. It's completely different up here in the clouds. It's a political battle between the big guilds and the small guilds striving to be as big and successful as those crushing them.<P>------------------<BR>Georgia Gaelicmyst<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Everlore Staff Member<BR>http://www.everlore.com/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Great post.  I completely agree.    The problem is people take this game way to seriously.  It's just a game, it's just an item, it's only play money.

</FONT><HR>I will definately agree that there has been somewhat of a decline in human compassion in EQ (mirroring RL.)<P>BUT<P>Uber lewts give a player/guild more freedom.  Freedom to go to zones where they are more likely to die than without the uber lewt - freedom to do certain zones as a guild with minimal downtime (cleric epic comes to mind.)<P>Since LEWT is a key ingredient in how powerful your character/guild is, it only stands to reason that UBER LEWT will be fought over.  Afterall, lewt makes EQ more fun, not only for lewt ho's, but gives more flexibility even for a casual roleplayer who is not focused on lewt.  More options make EQ more fun.<P>My cleric can't even visit Sebilis because she doesn't have the key.  This is a prime example of how LEWT matters.<P>The Celestial Healing scroll made me a much better cleric.  Another great example of important lewt.  Having that scroll makes the game more fun for me.<P>Competition also makes the game fun.  I do not believe that "might makes right", but I think that a little dose of reality makes EQ a bit more "real", which is nice.  Sure, it's a fantasy world, but it ain't Utopia, and I'm glad.<P>I don't care one lick if the uber guilds are roleplaying, but they certainly ARE playing a role.  The role they play makes perfect sense to me.  You are small, they are powerful.  They are taking what they can from Norrath.  If you are trampled upon, it's because you are standing in the way of their fun.<P>People do take this game seriously.  I'd say that sitting at your PC bored out of your skull for days on end is taking the game way too seriously.<P>Breaking down the walls with an army, killing everything in sight, and kill stealing Ragefire from the guy sitting there camping it for days is completely the opposite.  This method makes a lot more sense to me, sounds like A LOT more fun, and shows who is too serious (spawn campers), and who knows how to have fun.<P>Fun at the expense of others?  Perhaps.  But we are all anonymous, and no one really gets hurt anyways.  Like we all say, tis just a game.  In real life, most of us would not act that way, but this is not real life, so do whatever the hell you want.<P>You dis me on my server, though, and I will have you hunted down and killed repeatedly.  > <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Trawma Siirjen<BR>48 High Elf<BR>United Legions<BR>Vallon Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wrong, wrong, wrong, Trawma.<P>Here are the facts - we all play the game to have fun.  We all have the "right" to enjoy the game in whatever fashion we choose so long as we that fashion doesn't impinge on anyone else's fun.<P>Once such a conflict occurs, which is greater, your right to have fun by "breaking down the walls with an army, killing everything in sight, and kill stealing Ragefire from the guy sitting there" or the guy who's sitting there's right to have fun by "sitting there camping it for days"?<P>Reality check: your right to have fun isn't any greater.  Nor does making your way sound more fun make it so.<P>Apparently you believe that the uber guilds are justified in doing whatever they want because "you are small, they are powerful".  You say "if you are trampled upon, it's because you are standing in the way of their fun".  Well, guess what, their fun isn't allowed to take precedence over that of anyone else's, small or not.<P>Suppose: Verant reinstitutes item loot, and a bunch of ubers decide to camp your bind spot and kill you til you're equipment-less.  After all, they are powerful, and you are small.  And for whatever lame reason they find it "fun".  Are you having fun?  This is a theoretical question, so don't bother telling me about all your uber friends.  They're all busy being camped by my imaginary uber legions anyway.  So?  Having fun?  <P>Sure, it's just a game.  But even in games there needs to be a standard of fairness.  Because of the very anonymity provided by the internet, some people decide to have fun by playing jerks (griefers, if you know the term).  Verant had to institute the Play Nice Policy just to keep these people in check.  Their world, their rules.  Might does not make right.  They left it up to the server communities to figure out how to share, but if the community can't agree, it comes down to random. <P>Don't make the mistake of believing that the PNP doesn't have teeth.  People have been banned and guilds disbanded for PNP violations.<P>And don't hide behind "no one really gets hurt anyway".  No one invests the time that even a casual player puts into this game without developing some attachment to it.  There is a person behind the pixels, always.  That person has real feelings, whether you choose to recognize it or not.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Kydelian (edited 04-24-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>"It's only a game".  I guess people that say the same thing about the Superbowl, Stanley Cup, and World Cup.  While EQ doesn't compare in magnitude with those events, it does compare quite well with college sports.  Should larger colleges be allowed to have more people on the field at once?  It's only a game, after all.  No one gets hurt by someone else winning. </sarcasm off><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Trawma: The attitude expressed in your post is a great example of exactly what is wrong with this game, particularly the 50+ part of it.<P>Its not your fault, it is a major flaw in the design of the game. IMHO, the design of the game is flawed, in that to enjoy all aspects of the high level game, you inevitably take away fun from other players.<P>You kill dragons as soon as they spawn, thats great fun for you. Not too much fun for someone else who doesn't get off work until after your raid.<P>This game should have been designed in such a way that ALL can enjoy all aspects of it. No limiting introduction of items via long spawn times, rare drop rates, etc. Dynamic content is needed, so that if 5 guilds want to take on A single raid simultaneously, all can do it, in their own raid.<P>Saying the stronger person should get it, or the faster person, or the one logged in more of the time is just silly, when a system could have been made so that ALL can enjoy ALL of the content at their own pace, without having to take away from others.<P>------------------<BR>Meddik Sawbones<BR>Member of <A HREF="http://www.suvangi.com/drunkenbandits/" TARGET=_blank>Drunken Bandits</A><BR>(Bristlebane Server)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>This very reason is why I am looking long and hard at a game to be out in six months where each realm will need all of its people and not just the big guys to get to search for or protect their relics.  While it probably won't cure all, it will help others feel more of an accomplishment if the design is like it says.  The lower people might can help protect even if they are not out on the big raiding party.

I read who and what I had to do to get it and decided for myself that I dont want to / can not do it. End of story, no epic for me. Does that mean I have less fun? Dont think so. If I happen to be part of an ubber event there will sure enough be a cleric with a right click ressing stick.<P>Anyway, I agree with Urzak there is no use in complaining about how people play the game or if "morality" in the EQ population dropped or not. I would say it did not drop, when servers where young there where fights and discussions over spawns like Emperor Crush or the Orc Runner. Now its fights and discussions about Trakanon or Ragefire.<P>Take out everything ubber out of EQ and people will start killstealing bats and rats again.<P>just my 2cp<P>snorfen<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Great posts. I think Georgia Gaelicmyst hit it in one.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>This game should have been designed in such a way that ALL can enjoy all aspects of it. No limiting introduction of items via long spawn times, rare drop rates, etc. Dynamic content is needed, so that if 5 guilds want to take on A single raid simultaneously, all can do it, in their own raid.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Meddik, I think that game has been built and I have played it a lot. It is called Diablo/Diablo II. I found that it held my attention about a 1/10th of the time that EQ has. (Agree with most of what you say Meddik, not picking on you.)<P>Diablo was still a great game, but there is something to this world of Norrath that brings me back. Despite the jerks and stupid stuff that happens. It is primarily the people, but also the fact that Norrath isn't always arranged the way that would suite me the best. Just like RL when you think about it. So when I achieve something, then it is an actuall achivement. When I lost all my "stuff" in Dialbo due to being owerwhelmed and dying and not being able to get it back it was annoying, but not traumatic as it would be if I lost what my 2 year old EQ cleric carries around. A huge emotional difference. Which I think reflects the depths of the games.<P>I too belive that the game is mostly being played as designed. But with 30k-90k people on at anytime it is virtually impossible to police the whole thing, PnP or no PnP. I also belive you cannot design a game that would be as fun and involving as this, if there were no "real" dangers there. From trains, kill stealers, mobs, lost corpses, etc.<P>In the end it is "just a game", even though it is easy to forget sometimes. And I belive you will always have some people behaving like jerks when they can hide behind the anonymity EQ provides with virtually no risk of being taken down. But most people I come across are really nice, but then that may be because I am not camping Ragefire.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Verant should have separate servers where only nice people could play.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Naxy Dent, Cleric and accidental elder of Nature's Way, on Bristlebane<p>[This message has been edited by naxy (edited 04-24-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Naxy: I don't neccesarily mean something where advancement is as easy as Diablo. I don't mean that every person should be able to easily obtain everything.<P>I mean that one person attaining something should not make it less likely for a 2nd person to obtain it.<P>Take for example, AO's planned system of Dynamic content via missions. 1 group can go into a particular "Dungeon" and fight. A second group can enter that same dungeon, but the appearance and contents will be different, and personalized towards their party.<P>EQ could have been setup similar to this, so that overcrowding is limited. Lets take the classic example of LGuk before kunark. You zone in, and there are 90 people in there. This dungeon can only support about 30 or so before it starts getting crowded. Now imagine if when you zoned in, you were given an option of LGuk01, LGuk02, and LGuk03. If the poulation was smaller, maybe there would only be 1 LGuk running at one time, if the population was higher, maybe there would be more. (Note: I know there are issues with this as current game mechanics work, but think outside the box with me here for a minute)<P>The game should have been made adaptable to population fluctuations, etc. in zones, overcrowding in areas, and higher demand for certain targets. Same could be done with my Guk Example on a dragon raid. Lets say you tell an NPC "We have come to slay the dragon"<P>Upon saying this, it generates a zone, with the dragon. You can be in the middle of your dragon raid, and when another group wants to have a dragon raid, they can have theirs at the same time, in a identical but separate zone.<P>------------------<BR>Meddik Sawbones<BR>Member of <A HREF="http://www.suvangi.com/drunkenbandits/" TARGET=_blank>Drunken Bandits</A><BR>(Bristlebane Server)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Quote from Kydelian,<P>"Suppose... Verant reinstitutes item loot, and a bunch of ubers decide to camp your bind spot and kill you til you're equipment-less."<P>Actually, I preferred when Vallon Zek was item loot.  To answer your question - I would simply dust off the ole Necro, and begin ganking people to get some gear back.  If I'm lucky, I'll land some upgrades in the process.<P>BTW - if a bunch of ubers camped my bind spot, they would only get one piece of my gear, not all of it.  Corpse camping might be what you meant.<P>Interesting that you bring up the PvP servers, because we don't have this problem to the extent that the other servers do.  A lot of our disagreements can and are settled thru PvP.  Darky cleric camping Ragefire.  Not anymore cause lightie_uber_guild_006 just walked in and killed darkie cleric.  Pretty clear who owns the spawn at this point.  And that's roleplaying in it's most basic form.  It's up to darkie cleric to gather the forces to clear out the lighties.<P>Uber_lightie_guild_001 on a carebear server walks in and sees darkie cleric camping Ragefire.  After a short discussion, uber lighties decide to leave and try again some other day.  THAT'S HORRIBLE ROLEPLAY.  That darkie should be dead the minute those uber lighties saw him.  I just think it's ridiculous.  It's irrelevant that there is a human being behind that character.  We are not supposed to know that!  I don't want to know that.  This is an RPG.  This is a fekken video game.<P>I have a very different perception than most people of what Norrath should be.  In theory it works, even though the code doesn't support it very well.  With a major engine redesign, it would work.<P>I don't think there should be ANY rules forced upon us by the PnP or GMs.  None.  Free for all.  Anything goes.  Players must police themselves.  This is probably where we fundamentally disagree.<P>The enforcement of the PnP is so sporadic and inconsistent that it might as well not exist at all.<P>I do not /petition or /report griefers.  I log on an alt twink, and give em a taste.  The last thing I want is for a GM to show up right when I'm about to insert my evil into a total idiot.  I have personally enforced the PnP on idiots countless times, and have been /cheered by many helpless victims for doing so.  I will continue to do so because I get a lot of satisfaction from ruining a grief player's fun.<P>Hmm, ruining someone else's fun.  Guess that makes me a griefer.<P>An armed society is a polite society.<P>Trawma Siirjen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Trying not to single you out Trawma, but the kind of game you seem to want is similar to Ultima Online.  Which due to its kill stealing, corpse looting free for all format basically caused its great decline in participation of people playing, along with all the unfair hot key programs that got introduced. IMHO might doesn't always make right.. whether in a game or rl.  Your solutions, although FUN to you may be impossible or unacceptable behavior to others. <BR>One thing I do agree about is your scenario of the knight in shining armor approach to those that do intentionally aggavate, but unfortunatly most of the knights won't be around when someone truly needs them.. They will be out camp stealing or getting phawt lewt.  <BR>Dusklar 59th cleric </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Interest thoughts Trawma.<P>However, if you look at the number of PVP servers versus the non PVP servers, you will see you are approximately 10% of the population.<P>While those things you mention work on your server, that is not the same attitude that the majority of the population in EQ has.<P>As far as the RPG attitude, I think Verant long ago dropped any thoughts of this being a RPG game.  They won't even call it a RPG game anymore.  I belive they have adopted the title "fantasy" game.<P>In addition, I don't see how you think an armed society is a polite society.

</FONT><HR>heh  I can't claim the "armed society" comment as mine.  I stole it from G. Gordon Liddy   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Maybe you don't agree, but I'm sure you understand the theory behind it.  One is less likely to offend someone if he knows the guy has a weapon on him.<P>One is less likely to attack an old woman on a subway train, if he knows that the guy sitting next to her is armed.<P>In fact, it is probably THE major deterent to rural crime, where the only thing between a potential criminal and the farmer's daughter is a big fat sawed off shotgun.<P>I see it in EQ.  I do visit 2 carebear servers from time to time.  People being rude - yes, it happens on Vallon Zek.  But honestly, I see it more prevelant on Mithaniel Marr.  I think it's because no one can do anything about it.  You just have to sit there and take it.  This is the biggest reason I left the carebear servers.  To get away from the mentality of "I can treat you like sh*t, and you can't do a damn thing about it."  Oh, and I like killin people too.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>My wizard on Mith Marr is almost never played.  No one knows him, and so people don't think he deserves respect.  People are rude to him.  Well, on Vallon Zek, this same wizard would command a great deal of respect, regardless of who knew him.  He looks dangerous, and since you don't know him, he may fly off the handle at any moment.  People better be nice - or at least, not be rude.<P>Sorry that I don't have any suggestions on how to alleviate this problem of increased a$$holishness on the blue servers.  Even though PvP in EQ is flawed in almost every way imaginable, this particular issue is MUCH less of a problem for us.<P>Parallel dungeons at first seems to be a good method.  But this goes against the Vision.  Gotta control the phat lewt entering the world, don't we?  Well, maybe not necessarily.  We seem to be entering the second half of EQ's life cycle.  I say, it's time to let them have cake!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think the real 'problem', for lack of a better term, with EQ lately (aside from development and game balance issues which are in VI's hands only) is that a lot of the hardcore casual players have clocked enough hours xping to finally start showing up in the 50+ and 55+ range in large large numbers.  Now it's a culture clash; all the hardcore uber players are now surrounded by equally leveled hardcore casual players.<P>Not surprisingly, both groups find very little in common with one another.  Casual players seem to stake a huge amount of pride in their ability to "not care; it's just a game" method of calmly and meanderingly strolling through Everquest.  These casual players, as many of them now have characters in the cutthroat 50+ range, are finding that the way a lot of people who've been in that 50+ range longer do things differently.<P>Who do I think is 'better' or 'right'?  Not really a 'right' answer, but I identify far more with the hardcore ubers than I do with the hardcore casuals.  To me, the fun of EQ is seeing what one can get away with.  Not "get away with" in the criminal or mean sense, but in the sense of "can we do that?"<P>Example?  How many people do we need to kill someone?  My guild on TZ has been killing Phinny for someone's epic (Necro and Wiz I think) lately, we're having a blast with it, treating it like a challenge.  Our current 'record' is ten people less than ninety minutes from the first "/gu hey time to kill Phinny again, everyone who's going chime in".  We're convinced we can clear to and kill Phinny with a single group, but it'll have to be the right group with the right people.<P>That's fun.  A casual player might look at the above and go "gaaah" with a lip curled in disgust, but I'm a hardcore gamer.  I play games for the thrill of victory, the agony of defeat (as the old ABC sports guy used to say).<P>Without the challenge, without what I view as the *game*, EQ is just a fancy chat program with some rather interesting animated emotes.  That's all.<P>I don't chat, even with ICQ or whatever.  I log in to play, I come home ready to log in hoping to dive into an interesting problem to be solved.  Can we break Fear and clear it?  Can we kill Reavers in COM all night without any deaths?  Can we break through to the Royals in Chardok and clear them for some epic drops?<P>Finding out the answers to those kinds of questions is loads of fun, even when it doesn't work.  Sure it's way irritating when it *doesn't work* and it's for a stupid reason (like someone wasn't paying attention to instructions, or didn't understand the instructions and didn't ask for more help, or someone was afk without warning, or three key people went LD right as the fight started, etc...); but the feeling when you make something work, *especially* if 'they' said it was hard/impossible ... man.  Hard to describe, but anyone who's ever hit a home run or scored a touchdown or won a skill contest knows the feeling I'm talking about.<P>Nothing's wrong with 'just being a casual player'.  If your idea of fun in EQ is to log in and chat with your buds while selling stuff in the ECTunnel or in GFay for a few hours .. hey man, that rocks.  But not everyone will want to do just that.<P>So, where am I going with this?  Basically, I don't "get" why casual players have to look down on ubers for the ubers' desire to 'go further faster'.  I don't "get" why ubers have to look down on casuals because the casuals 'never do anything'.  It's unfortunate there are only a finite number of mobs and encounters in the world, but that's also a good thing.<P>I haven't played AC, but the 'dynamic content' thing doesn't sound very interesting to me.  When I log into TZ and hear "guild_001 just dropped Woushi", that means something to me that hearing "guild_001 dropped a dragon in their dynamicly generated sub-dungeon" doesn't.  Knowing all the mobs and their interrelations makes it fun.  Knowing the world is finite and thus limited because of it makes everything more real.  If there was an infinite supply of game encounters ... that's like Quake or Counterstrike.  I play CS, but to satisfy a different type of gaming urge than I'm trying to sate when I play EQ.<P>That also means there will, not too infrequently either, be situations where two or more groups are gunning for the same encounter/mob(s) a the same time.  This means there will have to be some way to sort out who does it now and who does something else.<P>Which goes to the blue vs red thing some of you are moving the thread into.  Blue vs red is a really stupid thing to debate, imo, because the typical blue player isn't interested in any arguments a red player might make for the red way.  Likewise, the typical red player isn't much interested by any position a blue player might offer for the blue method.<P>Pointing out there are more blue vs red doesn't really prove anything.  To illustrate what I mean by that, the difference between the two basically goes to how 'who gets what mob' arguments are settled.  On a blue server, you yell and scream at the person/people in question, you tell your guild and friends they're mean bastards who should be shunned, and you petition guides and gms seeking their arbitration.  On a red server, two sides disagree, they fight, one walks away, one stays.  And *then* they yell and scream, tell their guild and friends the guy's a mean bastard who should be shunned, and even occasionally petition guides and gms to eventually come around to look at something.<BR> <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Is one way 'better' than the other?  Well, we all know there's no way everyone will agree on the 'right' way to settle these kinds of issues.  So you chose the one you like.<P>So when you smugly point out there are more blue servers than red, all that says to me is more EQ players prefer to petition to have problems settled than to settle them on their own.  Since I don't like to have others settle those kinds of things if I can help it (mostly because I'm usually impatient to be getting on with whatever it is we having going that night), I vastly prefer the red method to the blue.<P>Red means I don't always win, but that's ok.  Not winning makes winning more fun when it happens; of course, always not winning pretty much just blows.  So hopefully you only sometimes not win, and win the rest of the time.<P>That way you have just enough whine to appreciate your cheese all the more.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>So the real problem is the level cap. There is no where to move on to for the players who have achieved "uberness". We all end up in the same place fighting for the same things. So more levels (70-80?) and lots more high end content is needed.<P>Oh my. What a mess that will make with the game. Look at all the strife with going from 50 to 60.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>So perhaps Verant should create a new dimension which is all uber, the Underworld (or something). Once you move down there you can take all your stuff with you, but if you move back to Norrath then you have access only to what you brought with you when you went down to the Underworld. <P>This will separate the playerbase, give an upgrade path but not mess with the old game.<BR>Just thinking loud here.<P> <P>------------------<BR>Naxy Dent, Cleric and accidental elder of Nature's Way, on Bristlebane<p>[This message has been edited by naxy (edited 04-25-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Trawma, I am an active worker at the RenFaire, which is a re-creation of England in the time of Queen Elizebeth I. If I actually lived in that time, which was an ARMED SOCIETY, I would be dead. Not because I am left handed, which would have been plenty to get me killed. Not because I can't be polite, which I always am. I just have a temper. The laws of the USA in the early 21 century are the only reason that I have not been Drawn and Quartered for killing about a dozen people. I play on a blue server for this reason. If I was on a PVP server, the first idiot to make me mad would have to leave the server, because he would NEVER be free from me, I would ACTIVELY hunt him down the instant he logged on, and kill him. I would do it over and over again, and make twinks to do it to his other characters.<P>The history of our world is not "An armed society is a polite society".

</FONT><HR>"An armed society is a polite society". <P>I don't think this totally applys to EQ simply because you're implying the fear of death is keeping people in line.<P>In EQ, death isn't permanent.  If it was, anyone over level 15 would be _VERY_ polite  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"> As it is, in many cases death doesn't really even hold a penalty for some... which I imagine is why there are so many wizards and monks on pvp servers...<P>Then there's the flipside... You can be as polite as you possibly can, but still get ganked. (low level opportunist punks don't care if you're polite or not ^_^)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Casual vs Uber.<P>Grief playing has always been justified with "it's just a game" since most people discovered it en masse in Diablo. But if it's "just a game" then why bother griefing in the first place? I remember someone with a hack who came into a public Diablo game I was in and he would res and kill me with one trick over and over until I was out of money. He then laughed at me and left the game.<P>I hadn't really lost anything. My character just had a few gold on him and I didn't lose anything of value, not that I couldn't hack the game myself and get it back. <P>But EQ is a Persistant State World. If you see someone with, say, a mage or a necro epic you know they earned it and aren't some random hack. So EQ is more than "just a game". It's also an investment of time, the same as anything else in the real world.<P>But the Internet is also anonymous. It doesn't matter who you are today because you can be the devil today and an angel tomorrow. So some people see that as license to do whatever they want and damn anyone who gets in their way (for the l337 people out there "P|_4y 2 (ru5|-|").<P>"Just a game" applies to something temporary. Like the game "Sorry". Yeah, I bumped your guy back to start. But it doesn't mean anything. Next time it might be your guy bumping me back. It's all in fun. But in a PSW like EQ it's like telling them "My time is worth more than yours". I liken it to the person who builds a sculpture in the sand. Yes, it's temporary. But at the same time, there's a reason they're spending the time and effort to do it. Now, take some spoiled brat who sees it and takes a running leap into it, destroying it. Would his saying things like "It's just sand" "I have as much right to be here as you do" "Well, if you were smart you wouldn't have left this where I could do this" justify it? Of course not. You've taken THEIR time and THEIR effort away.<P>In direct application to EQ, take Ragefire. On TZ/VZ it's acceptable to execute dark_elf00 who is camping Ragefire as those are the rules. I don't know, I really haven't played there. But on the "blue" servers it's just downright cold. I've seen larger guilds do it time and time again. That's why you really can't "camp" Ragefire. Because even if you sit there the entire time there's nothing to stop uberguild00 from running you over and saying things like "We have as much right to this as you do" "You shouldn't have left this where we could run you over" and the ever popular "It's just a game". And there's nothing you can do but sit there and watch them kill him after all that time you've put in.<P>It's not just Ragefire. It's not just my server. I have to laugh when I see one uberguild justify itself in terms another guild they've never even heard of used just a few days ago. See if these quotes sound familiar...<P>"Calendars favor the small guilds over the large ones and we're not going to stand for it so we're withdrawing and going FFA"<P>"You guys were moving too slowly so we took it"<P>"We need X item more than you do"<P>As I said, we play in a consequenceless world. Your reputation can't follow you around unless you want it to.<P>So go ahead and stomp on my character. Ruin my camp. Steal my mobs.

</FONT><HR>Something kinda like this happened to a friend of mine only worse. His guild was doing a trak raid. They're a pretty big guild but not "uber" and they were just about ready to go kill Trak when all of a sudden this monk from an uber guild comes running up the ramp and trains Trak onto himself, he then promptly ran into my friends guild and FD'd which took my friends guild by surprise and a nice bug CR then ensued. By the time they all got their stuff back the other guild had killed trakanon and was already gone. GMs wouldn't do anything either.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>To me morality is the ability to understand the importance of the physical and emotional well being of the individual and the society. With the understanding of morality people can make moral decision based on it. These decisions can help or cripple a person or persons. Uber guilds taking over everything and doing events every day is pointless. Theres hundreds of people who want to have fun. Go to any big guilds websight and it will say something like, Fear tuesday, Growth wednesday, Trakanon Friday, etc. Guilds need to take the time and make a friendship among themselves and not just an agreement to get each other loot in a game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>This is our standard definiton of a grief player. Please, Gniss, stay on your carebear server. Thanks.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Personally, I resent people calling the nonPVP servers "carebear" servers. It implies that we are children, when in actuality most of the scum in EQ reside on the PVP servers. Why you ask? Because they are the kids that thing PVP means you run around at level 5 with level 40 skill levels and kill level 1 newbie players trying to level in a newbie field. Because you get kids camping corpses. Because those kids also run around just to kill and take screenshots of the dead newbies to gloat.<P>I found after playing on Rallos Zek for a while that there are a rare few that actually roleplay. The rest are kids who enjoy ganking and ruining everyone's gaming experience.<P>I wish to ask you to think next time before posting. Just because I don't enjoy being ganked and losing my items, money, and experience to a kid with issues doesn't mean that I'm a carebear for playing on a server that prevents those actions from ruining my gaming experience.<P>------------------<BR>Georgia Gaelicmyst<BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR>Everlore Staff Member<BR>http://www.everlore.com/</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006088-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006088-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006088&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006088&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
