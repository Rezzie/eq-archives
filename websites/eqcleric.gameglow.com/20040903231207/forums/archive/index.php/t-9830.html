<br />
Sol B is my zone for hunting (well, that and OOT). I detest Guk with an abiding passion.<br />
<br />
Anyone requesting a ress must have their corpse brought to me. Since I am almost always at the first bat cave or deeper, this tends to cut down my ress list a bit.<br />
<br />
As with most zones, avoiding the &quot;kewl lewt&quot; camps is the best way to get XP and friendly conversation. Killing 5 LDC at once in the Stone Spider cave is much more interesting than listening to someone's level 25 warrior twink complaining that Painbringer has not dropped yet so he can loot it...<br />
