Tired of seeing all those corpses in LGuk's Entrance? Well, here is your chance to do something about it! Have everyone drag their corpses to one spot, stand there and res them all in one shot.<br />
<br />
Sanctuary. An Evac Type spell that ports the entire group to your home temple, at the cost of the Cleric's Life. Note: Any KOS people in your group may suffer the same fate, so be careful who you group with.<br />
<br />
Bless. A buff that can target only players of the same religion as you. Gives a small bonus to all Stats, as well as increased AC/HP (Stackable with all existing cleric AC/HP Buffs)<br />
<br />
Targetable Divine Aura. Must be grouped with someone, higher mana cost than DB, but could be a big life saver.<br />
<br />
I Know that these will likely never happen, but I can dream, right?<br />

<br />
How about Divine Luminescence- where you turn night into day for a whole zone(umm- let there be light)?  <br />
<br />
On a less tongue-in-cheek note-<br />
I always liked the &quot;turn undead&quot; spell from the New World Computing RPG games.  But that killed undead, if I remember correctly.  I always thought it should have them turn from the dark side to the light side and fight with you.<br />
<br />
I LOVED the &quot;divine intervention&quot; spell that cleric's got in that game- all characters back to 100% health and no ill effects. Even those who were &quot;eradicated.&quot;  Could not be cast then for a game day or some such.<br />
<br />
Clerics also had &quot;curse&quot; which I never fully exploited in those games, but I was surprised that VI didn't implement something like this.<br />

Actually, if you did that, it MIGHT happen.  But the Paladins would start yelling it was too much like LOH.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I love the Sanctuary idea and the Bless idea, adds more clout to faction and religion.  I also love the &quot;Sacrifice&quot; or &quot;Tithe&quot; ideas that were mentioned in Brodder's post.  <br />
<br />
Im all for more ideas that are something new over &quot;Give me their toy&quot; stuff.  <br />

Hahahaha, AoE ress  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Guess we would start ranting about &quot;ninja corpses&quot; who sneak in on our resses without paying  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
<br />
I do think a non-grouped AoE heal would be very, very nice though...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badina</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry you'r all confused these are the expansion spells:<br />
<br />
Hammer of Super Unswerving Faithfulness:<br />
Mana 1300<br />
Health: 31<br />
Description:<br />
Yes some of you actually bought (money sink) the previous pet and casted (mana sink) the previous pet! This one is just more of the same but higher mana cost, less healthand has a random chance of suiciding before the fight is even over. If your pet manages to make it through the fight, just like the old one it will then poof!<br />
<br />
FizzleHeal<br />
Mana 400<br />
Casttime:2 seconds<br />
Effect: Heals 1000 hit oints<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
This level 60 spell is designed to be incredibly attracctive to cast, resonable mana cost , very nice heal, super fast cast but because you get it at level 60 and combined with the new increased fizzle rates we anticipate you will never be able to cast it without at least 4 fizzles on average. This being the cast your actual mana cost is more like 800 and cast time is more like 8 seconds but you'll all be too stupid to realize it and have many party members die before you finally change back to Remedy.<br />
<br />
Buff of the Gods:<br />
Cast time: 1 minute<br />
Duration: 30 seconds<br />
Mana 1000<br />
Effect:Gives Symbol of Naltron and Mark of Karn to every party member<br />
Desctiption: The symbol component will last after the mark component fades. We just wanted a way to sap you of mana even faster and a way to actually imoblize you and remove you from a fight for an extended time to hopefully get some more people killed and waste all your time so you dont ever actually hit 60th and will keep playing forever. Of course we didn't take into acount the fact this will piss people off to no end and eventually when the next better thing comes along youll all be gone, but well be working on EQ3 by then anyway sso we really dont care.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Sorry all the rubbish I can come up with in one sitting  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riffi</div><div class="date">08-02-2000, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Religious spells that vary according to your godling:<br />
<br />
Bertoxxulous:  As a champion of disease, cast a disease DOT spell.<br />
<br />
Brell Serilis:  As a minion of the Duke of Below, cast an earthern hammer spell (basically pet) ... short lasting, gobs of mana, but lasts more than one stupid fight.<br />
<br />
Bristlebane:  As a representative of the King of Thieves, gain an ability to pick locks while spell duration lasts.<br />
<br />
Cazic-Thule:  As a follower of the Lord of Terror, uhhh ... not sure ... Fear, but clerics already cast fear.<br />
<br />
Erolissi Marr:  The Queen of Love could grant the power of a cleric to improve his/her charisma.<br />
<br />
Innoruuk:  The Prince of Hate could spure his hangers-on with better Yaulp spells, even those that are castable on other people.<br />
<br />
Karana:  Since his followers live a nomadic lifestyle, a weak spirit of wolf ability ... short lasting spell, gobs of mana.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Anyhow, you get the gist.<br />
<br />
Let clerics actually be representative of their religion.  I despise the fact my gnome cleric is exactly the same as a dark elf cleric, when they have literally nothing in common with regards to Norrathian life.<br />

That would make things a lot easier.</div></div><hr />
