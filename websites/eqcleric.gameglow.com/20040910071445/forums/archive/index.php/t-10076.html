<br />
Spent the weekend camping the Lower Guk Live Side Tower with a group, got really lucky in lotto and won a Runed Falchion. It was the only Falchion dropped on 10 crusader spawns.  And if any of you have done it, the placeholder for the crusader pops quite often.<br />
<br />
Im a well equipped lvl 40 cleric and have very few items that I would actually want in trade, but any of these would do : )<br />
 <br />
Rubicite BP<br />
Paw of Opalla<br />
Abalone Gorget<br />
P Kedge Totem<br />
Ghoulbane (for my RL pally friend)<br />
<br />
I have some other items I could throw in to try to even up a trade: like Dwarven Workboots, Shield of Slain Unicorn, Langseax of the Wolves, etc... And, like i said, unless its an absurd amount, i am not looking for platinum really. Ive been offered a manastone already but i already have that (which is why the ruby bp would be so nice).<br />
<br />
Gimme a tell in-game or post here if your interested. <br />
