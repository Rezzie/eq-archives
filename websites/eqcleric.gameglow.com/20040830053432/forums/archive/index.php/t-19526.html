 I have currently been in with my guild for aprox 2 years now and love them but unfortunatly can not raid with them due to time constraints /w work. the server I am on has no guilds raiding at such time and start work to early to join euro guilds.<br />
 I am looking to join a guild min teir 3 in pop or higher would love joining a time guild if accepted. but no time flag. So if you know of a guild that starts a raid between 8pm to 12pm pst (prefer 10pm)and is in need of clerics plz leave link and I will apply on your boards. willing to switch servers. I love to raid and willing to raid every night thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />
