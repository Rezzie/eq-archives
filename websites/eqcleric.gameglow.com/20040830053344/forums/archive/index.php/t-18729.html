<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamini</div><div class="date">05-02-2004, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Legendary is currently recruiting a few more clerics. We are mainly a Euro guild, with raids starting at about 5 - 7 pm GMT ( 11 am - 2 pm EST). We're a big family, and the clerics are really a little crazy family among the big one, and we'd be happy to be able to welcome any newcomer and make them feel at home ;)<br />
We're in the EPs and working our way to Time, missing 2 kills for it.<br />
We also raid VT on regular basis as we are part of a rotation.<br />
Lvl 65 is required, as well as some AA. If you are interested, go check www.eqlegendary.com for more info :)</div></div><hr />
