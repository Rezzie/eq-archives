<br />
Also, at 15, try Dervs in the Commons/Ro or Bandits in the Karanas<br />

<br />
You can kill gnolls and undead reavers, along with assorted other stuff, in East Karana.<br />
<br />
You can kill dervs in North and South Ro, the Commonlands, and the Oasis of Marr. <br />
<br />
You can kill gnolls in Highhold Pass.<br />
<br />
You can kill crocs in the Oasis of Marr.<br />
<br />
You can kill orcs on the orc highway in the Oasis of Marr.<br />
<br />
Those are the places I hunted from 14-18.<br />

A friend recently went from 15 to 20 there and made 150-200pp in the process.</div></div><hr />

Hard to remember exactly but I'm fairly sure I spent about 14/15-17 in South Ro.  South Ro is great because there are many wandering undead, BOTH dervish camps have a solo dervish you can pull, and if you're a dark elf, there is a vendor RIGHT there to sell all the bronze weapons you get.  I made a fortune in this zone and made very fast exp soloing here.  The few times I died I wasn't far from my bind point and was able to memorize my DD spell and exact revenge.  *sigh* memories of being able to solo well...<br />
