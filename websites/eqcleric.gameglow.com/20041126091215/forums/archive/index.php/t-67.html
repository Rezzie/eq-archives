I'm sure that Brad would never say that in public.</div></div><hr />

Brad and the other people of Verant really don't know how to deal with customers.  We give them advice on issues we have, they ignore.  We ask them to they test their product, they spit out cheesy stats on some 2 week beta test nonsense.  Their smug attitude will be the death of them.<br />
<br />
I play the game to be with friends.  When something better comes along, I will end my days in EQ.  Till then, I play the game and have fun with friends, inspite of the way I am treated.  Just my thoughts.<br />

Fare thee well.<br />

<br />
Brad and Gordon only post on the Verant boards, because they can guarantee that when they post as &quot;Aradune&quot; or &quot;Abashi&quot; that it's really them.<br />
<br />
I could create an &quot;Abashi&quot; account here, and post a few things and make it sound like it was really him...<br />

<br />
I have only recieved one rez in my entire playing time and I know they are not that easy to obtain.  I personally have played classes (like druids - sow me, buff me, heal me, TP me) and I know how annoying being constantly begged for help can be so I won't beg other players for assitance.  Since I know only one or 2 high level clerics and they don't often group with me, like most players, I do without.<br />
<br />
My cleric is only level 24, so I am not yet rez capable but I have an inkling of what lies in store.</div></div><hr />

Gordon has posted on the official forums that he thinks the xp loss is negligible because you can almost always get a res that restores 96% xp, and necros can summon corpses, so there is nothing to lose from dying, right? they are friggin idiots... sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ocelot</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its proly a cut and past for an email that brad sent the guy.........and like any news reporter he took a part of a hole statement and posted it (sound bite).  For one thing I have NEVER seen an email from brad that was less than one paragraph long.<br />
<br />
I give things like this no play.<br />
