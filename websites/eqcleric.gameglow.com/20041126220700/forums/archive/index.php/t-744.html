It's the weekend and lets forget about all this silliness.  Lets change the topics and go to something more fun. <br />
1)  Who's doing what this weekend?<br />
<br />
2)  Who will be levelling this weekend?<br />
<br />
3)  Anything else associated with fun.<br />
<br />
As for me, I think we have a complete cleaning of Kedge planned for tonight as well as a multi party planning of the &quot;disco&quot; area of Sebilis for tomorrow.  I should ding to 56 either tonight or tomorrow.  WOOHOO - new RES.  Any clerics on Veeshan &quot;dying&quot; to test and see how much xp back this give (grin - kidding).  Anyway, lets get onto something more fun and get past this &quot;hot&quot; topics and have fun.<br />

<br />
The flow of ideas on this board is great, lots of creative folks post here.<br />
<br />
Whoever posted on gameplay came up with a great thread, most likely a compilation of thoughts we shared here.<br />
<br />
I'd hate for something this good to get swept under the carpet.<br />

<br />
Then, on a lark, I log in to EQ last night, join a pickup group outside Karnor's Castle, and have a blast, even with the link deaths and ever shifting composition of the group.<br />
<br />
Broke into my last bubble of 46, so I now plan to make 47 Sunday night (next chance to play) and hope to make 48 by next weekend, then 49 the weekend after that....you get the picture.<br />
<br />
Glad to be back to EQ, can't wait to make 49 and get Resurrection!  Good luck on making 56 Dalur!<br />

<br />
Last night I led my guild and one other on a 3 group raid into Chardok. All was well until close to the last pull, I was the only cleric left, and 6 mobs came a rushing! We had two enchanters, but after my first heal I was done with quite quickly. Two of the 3 groups were able to Evac, 3rd group even though they had two druids, did not. Well After two hours of CR (oh yeah we were the only ones in the zone when we trained ourselves deep in it) all we managed to do was create more corpses. Hehe. No necro, rogue, or monk was able to help. Guess my fun is finishing up CR.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Might go and buy next circle of spells when I log in so I dont have to run from warslilk to neriak after I ding =/ After I get 30 I wanna go try out my new spells in EC though &gt;  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif (EC is regarded as an Arena zone on TZ). Need to get some resists gear made too, heh. <br />
<br />
also, its funny how much planes/dragons are done on blue servers =P On TZ Lighties havn't killed Naggy yet, and Trakanon hasn't gone down yet. I think ppl have only gone as far as second island in sky too. Inno and Cazic been killed a few times though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenae</div><div class="date">08-04-2000, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vox and Naggy; thats what I have planned for the weekend.  Going with two different groups (hey - good healers are popular!), one on Sat afternoon and the other on Monday night.<br />
<br />
I don't know what it is like elsewhere, but on Luclin the dragons haven't died in over a month.  The big guilds are too big, the small guilds are too small, and the medium sized guilds haven't got enough in the right level bracket (46-52) to do the job.  So what we have done is to get basically a large &quot;Dragon Hunting Pickup Group&quot; from many different guilds and are going to go give it a try  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Equipment inspections up front (CR/FR/MR), good explanations of what is going on, and in we go.  It'll be a massacre!  <br />
<br />
At least, I hope it's Nag and Vox that get massacred, and not me!  This will be my second dragon hunting expedition ever so it should be fun  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Friday night - play as much as I can and try to get 37th level - with my good group in FV it should be no sweat (and no RL interruptions).<br />
<br />
Saturday - Going to a Irish Festival for the day and a good steak dinner by night (I am part Scottish, but Damn those Irish can make some good beer!)<br />
<br />
Sunday - Going shooting with my girlfriend (I think Sporting Clays). After that I hope to get back on EQ Sunday night and move towards 38...<br />
