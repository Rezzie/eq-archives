We had Hate mostly cleared and according to the guild that did it the drop rates were borked badly...much worse than the Fear drop rates.  If this is the case we need to publicize it so Verant fixes it quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunkard</div><div class="date">02-03-2000, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I when to Hate a day or 2 after the patch went in.  In 18 hours, there were 4 armor drops, 2 cleric, 2 warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinyhalo</div><div class="date">02-06-2000, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have killed the fixed clerics in Hate 3 times, spending about a total of 30 hours in hate over 3 days. Each time ONE piece of cleric armor dropped making the drop rate approximately 4 percent. <br />
<br />
It just takes too much work to play this game now. It takes all day to get everyone into hate, resurrect, and kill all the fixed clerics for ONE piece of armor which has to be randomed between the average 8 clerics there.<br />
And this ASSUMES that all the other classes don't mind spending all their time killing clerics which of course they DO mind.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly I HATE verant. Since the release of this game they have made the game worse and worse. They should just let people have fun for Gods sake. I don't care if some class can solo better than another or if everyone has a manastone. WHO CARES. If they were having fun let them be. I will never buy one of their products again let alone their expansion which they can RAM.</div></div><hr />

Take into account we are a relatively new server (Vallon Zek) and really learning how to deal with Hate.   We have gotten so far 2 Ethereal Mist Drops (bracer, and gloves), 2 warrior Indoliche drops (bracer and gloves too), and bard bracer drop (which was destroyed since we are on Race War server and being Dark team have no bards).  All these drops were off the House spawns...none of the patrol spawns dropped anything for us.  Of course the patrol (worthless) spawns very quickly while the house spawns (which are good) are 6 or 8 hour spawns.<br />
     Hate is horrible now.   The place is so bugged its silly.  Pathing is so messed up there that its easy to get trained.  Fortunately we have learned alot and are generally getting better at avoiding them.<br />
<br />
P.S.  I believe we are the first same team (Dark Elf/Troll/Ogre only) guild on either VZ or TZ to sucessfully break into Hate<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">02-14-2000, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok just thought I would post an update of PoH and their drops.  Xanit K'ven (my guild) did Plane of Hate from last saturday night to this sunday night (about 9 days) for about 100 hours.  We never really cleared the zone except for the last 2 days (since we were on a new server and learning how to break and pull in Hate).  One thing, Aggro range in Hate is crazy, and pathing is so horrible that the slightest error can cause a bad train and lots of lost time doing Corpse recovery.  We usually had about 22 people in the zone (as low as 12 and high as 34).  <br />
Ok to Drops:<br />
Ethereal Mist (Cleric): 1 Breastplate(YAY!), 2 Bracers, 1 Glove, 1 Boot, 1 Prismatic Shield<br />
Indocolite (Warrior): 1 Helm, 2 Bracers, 1 Glove, 1 Arms<br />
Imbrued (Bard which we destroyed since being on a dark team only guld): 1 Breastplate, 1 Greaves, 1 Gloves, 1 Arms<br />
We Killed Maestro 2 times and got Monk Mask destroyed, sucks), Shield of Stalwart Shields (euridite paladin item), Evensong (bard mace) All of which was destroyed since we are EVIL   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
So basically we got 6 Cleric Armor Drops, 5 warrior drops, and 4 bard armor drops.  100 hours with us being the guild/group in there  and lots of deaths due to it being a BUGGED Zone.  Only saving grace was that Cleric BP.  If you are an Enchanter, Magician, Shaman...damn I feel bad for you all.<br />

abashi's reply:<br />
  The difference in loot drops is due to the fact that the zones are designed to drop X pieces of armor per day. Since spawn frequency in Hate is higher than Fear, the percentage is less. We may have underestimated the amount of time necessary to clear Hate, which is having the effect of giving less of a reward for similar effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've mentioned this to a few of the zone tuners, so we'll look at it. However, I can tell you that we haven't yet decided whether or not the loot difference is an imbalance at this point. As you may recall, a few weeks ago people were complaining that Fear was useless and people were camping Hate, now they complain the opposite. It's possible that we let the pendulum swing a bit too far in the other direction.<br />
