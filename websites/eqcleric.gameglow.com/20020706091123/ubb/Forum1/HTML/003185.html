</FONT><HR>I have complained about this before but I saw something last night that maybe helped decifer what is going on....<BR>I was inside the Sarnak Castle with a group in a room where there are no spawns. <P>Three things were occuring that seemed odd (including this auto-aggro issue). Perhaps these shed some light on the problem.<P>1) There was a long hall leading from our room. A spawn point was in the middle of the hall. As I stood there (as a cleric) an Adherent spawned, and just stood there for a few minutes. Through the wall behind us out popped a recuit and started to beat on me. Note this recruit was VERY aggro on me without me taking even a swing. The group had nukers and taunters.... it took a root by me to get away at 50% hps. It almost seemed as if he was affected by previous battles and downtime heals that I had fired off on the groups 5-10 minutes before. Note the adherent never aggroed on us or came after us during the fight... (i.e. was outa the aggro range).<P>On a similar line but a little later, the spawn in front of us in the hall behaved in the same way. A recuit *ran* right through the room like twice... same direction. He behaved as mobs do when you are lagging... (i.e. oblivious to you). But he was definately aggroed on somebody... running really fast. Then at the *other* end of the long hallway he appeared and b-lined it for me (the cleric) bring the adherent with him (as he passed).<P>2) Randomly we would get smacked by a mob that we could not see or hear and were standing in the middle of the room. We would never hear from the mob again. Just one - You have been hit for xx dmg. and that is it. I know we never saw that exact MOB again because I was hit by a Dragoon, however we did not kill one all night (several hours of fighting). I know they were not *behind* the walls, or being fought by another group nearby because there were no indications of fighting. In addition there were no groups nearby. <P>3) Random faction losses during downtime. Sometimes we would get periodic faction losses (no exp) for sarnack deaths while we were not engaged... Not just a few... but quite often. (i.e. it was not the mob that got away and got killed) Besides we were in a closed environment and never let a kill escape.<P>This kinda leads me to believe that maybe a problem with overlapping halls that for some reason are allowing aggros to occur with mobs far below you, that you perhaps cannot even get to. This would explain while we think that we are not engaged, there already are aggoed mobs on another plane, that are receiving taunts from a healing cleric. <P>This would also perhaps explain why the mobs seem to b-line for the cleric. The pally stated that before I arrived, the mobs were b-lining it to him (the healer at that time).<P>This was VERY frustrating to me as a cleric because I was unable to effectively heal my group. I was always aggroed by some mob.... always getting beat on... and sometimes the taunt factor was large enough that the mob had to be killed or rooted to get him off of me... (Was definately not frenzied as I was at at least 50% health). Only rarely did I even have much meditation time.... Would start medding and whammo.... get beat on....<P>Anyways.. I know this was long... but has been very frustrating and perhaps shed some light on the issue for Verant...<P>Sanedar <BR>Cleric of the 25th er 24th er 25th season <BR>Land of Tunare<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It's a known bug in Kunark. Apparently mobs can yell for help just as you or I can. What this does is copy the hate list of your mob onto any other mob with friendly faction. The problem is that the NPCs in Kunark have apparently been given the ability to yell in a HUGE radius. This means that things that you can't even see from where you are can get you on their hate list.<P>Case in point...<BR>A good place to get exp well into your 40s is the forest giants of FV. In the immediate area there are Drolvargs and Kunark frogloks. Each has their own faction. Now, near the FG house there is a Drolvarg temple with lots of Drolvargs inside. Now, occasionally a drolvarg will wander by and agro onto us and we would kill it. Inevitably, a few minutes we would get another faction hit for drolvargs.<P>It gets worse...<P>The frogloks will actively seek you out. I have a friend who camped these giants for a week solid but he was ALWAYS plagued by the frogloks showing up and often times walking past the entire group just to beat on him. I ran into the same problem myself. Killed a froglok after about an hour one night and I could not keep them off me.<P>So I tested Gordon's theory. The Swamp of No Hope is nearby so we all zoned in and zoned back. Lo and behold, we didn't see another frog the rest of the night.<P>Unfortunately, nobody at VI has a clue as to why this is so until it is found you should consider it a "feature" and I would recommend your group zoning once the agro becomes that bad. <P>Wish there was something better but that's your only answer for now  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Cleric of Prexus<BR>Proud member of The Steel Wind<BR>Cazic Thule Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The inability to pull someting properly in Karnor's is also a possible symptom of the huge "yell for help radius." Every attempted pull has to be babysat all the way back to where your group is staked out.<P>You can beat on something for a while but all the "yells for help" your mob is getting from around the place seem to distract the mob from the matter in hand. Several times the mob has come all the way to our group, taken a few seconds' worth of damage, and then zipped off to latch onto someone else. This is just conjecture, but it might be that the other person is already on the hate list of every mob around who then each transferred their hate list on to your pull as it came through, outweighing the damage done by the puller.<P>It's certainly an annoying "feature", whatever the cause.<P>Tem<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Monsters in Kunark will also "give up" on trying to catch someone pretty easily, which can lead to problems.<P>Your puller, with SoW, goes out into the zone, tags a monster, and heads back to your camp.  He outpaces the monster a little too much, though, and the monster heads back to his spawn point.  No biggie - he pulls something else instead.  Remember, though - he's *still* on that monster's aggro list!  From that point on, every time you heal or buff the puller, you're putting *yourself* higher on that monster's aggro list - and since the monster has been "activated", so to speak, he's yelling for help around him, even though he's not fighting you.<P>So now you're at the top of this one monster's hate list, and he spreads his hate list around.  If the puller comes back with anything that's been near him, they'll go STRAIGHT for you - they hate you more, after all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>What was said is basically how I've seen the situation for the past few levels in Kunark.  Clerics beware, because Sarnaks, drachnids.. pretty much anything intelligent is going to /tell his buddies, "Hey, this Goldenrod's healing the damn ranger I pulled, give me a hand." <P>I've been fighting at the ledge to the Frontier Mountains in Overthere, medding and minding my own business, and have Sarnaks another group is pulling come and beat me bluer than normal.  Its also bad in the Dreadlands with drachnids.  All I can say is be sure and have both Divines out, and Atone is a nice one... all else fails, root and erase it's memory before you're reduced to shredded gold foil.<P>Of course, I don't really mind this.. its realistic, and the only time it gets REALLY annoying has been spider hoardes in the Dreadlands.  Other than that, it adds a little life to the otherwise idiotic mobs we all know and laugh at.<P>Lokus Z'Asrithe<BR>Regent of the Prince<BR>Evoluxa<BR>Brell Serilis</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>As soon as you get a faction hit for no apparent reason you know that you are being placed on other mob's agro list by a mob out of "detection" range. I would suggest you all camp to clear it. As a healer you will more that often be the focus of this "passed" agro. <P>Seems this most happens when an SoWed puller pulls one mob and passes just in the range of an unseens mob's agro radius then quickly leaves it, never knowning a second mob was agroed.
