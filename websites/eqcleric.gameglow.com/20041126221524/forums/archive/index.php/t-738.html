<br />
Lets see, the time limit on a res was increased to 3 hours.  Dark elven clerics got some quests (check out the guild leader).  Kunark came out (dont remember if you have jboots are not, really need them now).  Karana had a server split.<br />
<br />
Other than that, not much has changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you get a chance, stop by on Terris-Thule and say hello.<br />
