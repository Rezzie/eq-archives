<br />
They wanted a roleplayed wedding, so that's what they got. Gourry is a paladin of Mithaniel Marr and Camarilla is a druid of Tunare. If you do a search and replace, you'll be all set. Altho this ceremony won't work for evils, tho! <br />
<br />
You can download the file in .rtf format if you would like to have it (it's only 12K, a small file), which Microsoft Word will read, as well as Windows Wordpad from this link...<br />

<br />
You'll see a reference to a tower of flames, we did this ceremony at the base of the Aviak Tower in Lake Rathe.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
Wedding Ceremony<br />
<br />
Participants: Camarilla and Gourry, Bride &amp; Groom<br />
Alliliel, Celebrating<br />
Loevon, Best Man<br />
Genevieve, Maid of Honor<br />
<br />
Items Required:	<br />
Gourry’s Sword (I recommend Ghoulbane)<br />
Camarilla’s Jewel (Can be any kind)<br />
Wedding Rings x2 <br />
<br />
Preparation:	Cami and Gourry should have no visible weapons, or armor on of any kind. However, both should have all their wedding gear in inventory, ready to put on. Genevieve and Loevon should be dressed in their armors, with no helm or weapons equipped. ALL participants should be set to WALK, not RUN. <br />
<br />
Ceremony:<br />
<br />
At the appointed time, Alliliel will make a /shout, informing those in the zone a wedding is taking place, and to invite those who wish to come, and requesting non-interference from others as far as spam, etc... Alliliel will request all observers to form a circle at the base of the tower and to be seated. Alliliel is in the circle as well, but standing.<br />
<br />
4 people are in the center of the circle, in a line, facing Alliliel. From left to right: Loevon, Gourry, Camarilla, Genevieve.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Summoned, I come to this place, and I make it holy in the name of Tunare, whom I serve. Who comes?<br />
<br />
Gourry: I do.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: What is your desire?<br />
<br />
Gourry: To be made one with Camarilla Spirit’Wolf.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Is this of your own free will and accord? Are you worthy and welcome? Of proper age and means?<br />
<br />
Gourry: It is and I am.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: It is well. What is your desire? <br />
<br />
Cami: To be made one with Gourry Gabriev.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Is this of your own free will and accord? Are you worthy and welcome? Of proper age and means?<br />
<br />
Cami: It is and I am.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: It is well. Our work today is happy work. <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues)We are gathered in the presence of the deities of the fruitful trees, the flowing waters, the warming sun and the singing air, <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) and in the sight of all the righteous deities of Norrath to celebrate the joining of our two dear friends Camarilla and Gourry in union by the fasting of their hands by ancient rite.<br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) As marriage is a holy and honorable act, to be entered into only with the most serious mind and reverent heart, you must be made pure to wash away worldly concerns. <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) To honor the Elder Days, you will ascend this tower and enter the cleansing flames above, and emerge reborn, ready to enter a new life, properly attired as befits your stations. <br />
<br />
Camarilla and Gourry goes up the tower in WALK speed, and enter the flames for a few seconds, put on their wedding gear, then walk back down and take the same place in the circle. DO NOT EQUIP SHIELDS, WEAPONS OR ANY KIND OF MELEE ITEM.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Who stands for this man?<br />
<br />
Loevon: I do.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Has he the blessings of his House, his Clan and his Brothers?<br />
<br />
Loevon: He has.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: It is well. Gourry Gabriev, I find thee pure in heart, clear of mind, strong in war, and gentle in peace. The valor of Mithaniel Marr lives in thee, and it is worthy. By what rite or token do you present as a pledge of thy troth?<br />
<br />
Gourry equips his sword in melee slot.<br />
<br />
Gourry: This ring and my sword. Together they are as pure as my love, as keen as my devotion and as strong as my promise. <br />
<br />
Alliliel: It is well. <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) Gourry, if you truly desire to marry this elfmaiden, I ask thee to give, wholeheartedly, the blade which symbolizes thy strength, and the valor of Mithaniel Marr. <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues)Swear thy weapon to her, always to be at her service.<br />
<br />
Gourry EMOTES: “/em offers his sword to Camarilla”<br />
<br />
Gourry: My most beloved, Accept the oath of love that I offer thee. I vow this sword, as I vow my soul, ever to be at thy service. <br />
<br />
Gourry (continues) Like this blade my heart will be strong, like this magical steel my love will endure. <br />
<br />
Gourry (continues) As the sun and the stars above are old, as the roots and buds below are new, I swear. <br />
<br />
Gourry (continues) Accept it, my chosen one, for all which is mine, will now be thine. <br />
<br />
Camarilla targets Gourry and EMOTES: “/kneel”<br />
<br />
Camarilla EMOTES: “/em touches the sword to her forehead.”<br />
<br />
Camarilla: My most beloved, I accept this oath, sworn on thy blade. Thou knowest what is in my heart, as I know what is in thine.<br />
<br />

<br />
Gourry unequips his sword.<br />

<br />
Camarilla equips her jewel.<br />
<br />
Camarilla: This ring and my jewel. Together they are as pure as my love, as keen as my devotion and as strong as my promise. <br />
<br />
Alliliel: It is well. <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) Camarilla, To marry this man, I ask thee to give, wholeheartedly, the jewel of beauty which thou wearest, in symbol of Tunare’s great magic and power. <br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) Swear thy jewel to him, always to be at his service<br />
<br />
Camarilla EMOTES: “/em offers her jewel to Gourry”<br />

<br />
Camarilla (continues) Like its beauty my heart will be strong, like this value my love will endure. <br />
<br />
Camarilla (continues) As the sun and the stars above are old, as the roots and buds below are new, I swear. <br />
<br />

<br />
Alliliel: (continues) Thou who shalt be husband and wife, listen to what we say, here and now. <br />
<br />
Alliliel: (continues)Whatever each of thee may accomplish in future years, wherever thou may wander, know full well that thou shalt do all for the righteous, for thy family and thy kin, and to be worthy, either to the other.<br />
<br />
Alliliel (continues) Above thee are the stars, below thee are the stones. Remember always, like a star should thy love be constant, like the Earth should thy love be firm. <br />
<br />
Alliliel: (continues)Possess one another, yet be understanding. Have patience, for storms may come and go. <br />
<br />
Alliliel: (continues)Be free always in giving of affection and of warmth, for our Gods, Tunare and Mithaniel, and all the righteous will always be with thee.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Dost thou desire, Camarilla, to have this man as thy husband, forsaking all others, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, until the ages comes to and end?<br />
<br />
Camarilla: I desire it.<br />
<br />
Alliliel: Dost thou desire, Gourry, to have this elfmaiden as thy wife, forsaking all others, for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse, until the ages comes to and end? <br />

<br />
A few days ago, I posted a URL to a site with about 25 different druid/pagan/wiccan/asatru ceremonies and I went through there and picked what I liked from all different ones.<br />
