</FONT><HR>I remember VI asking what folks thought of the PnP policy after it had been in effect for a month or so. I don't believe they asked for customer input before implementing PnP though.<P>It's a bit disingenuous to mention they are making changes to the CS policy, let us know they're gonna implement them in a week and ask for suggestions before posting these 'sweeping' changes. If they really wanted the customer's input, they'd let us know what they had in mind first. Holding back their plan means makes me very nervous..<P>------------------<BR>Derenath Enikinteel<BR>60 Dwarven Cleric<BR>Zebuxuruk<BR>-=Bah yer na' 'urt, walk it off =-</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Let's say you walk into your bank and walk up to the teller and pull out your bank statement and say "Excuse me, but I noticed that I was assessed a fee for a service I never requested." and the teller goes "I can't help you with this, let me get the manager here". 2 hours later, the manager comes out, takes a look, walks back to his office, comes out a minute later and says "I talked to the person in charge of complaints and he says that you signed a form to open the account but you didn't sign the form saying you didn't want this service so the charge is correct and will continue".<P>A form to NOT get a service? It would be absurd. And to make matters worse, you were never told about this form until they started charging you when, of course, it was too late.<P>What would you do? You'd probably change banks.<P>EQ, for the past 2.5 years, has had no real competition. So, being the only game in town, they didn't seem to care a whole lot about things like CS and such.<P>Recently, a friend of mine <A HREF="http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006827.html" TARGET=_blank>lost half his epic</A>. He had the ranger epic, which is 2 swords, one of which can only be used in the off hand. To make a long story short, his inventory was full and the primary hand went into the second hand and the other sword went poof when looted. He was told by the lead GM (who has gone out of her way to help us many times in the past) that...<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Sent on 9/20 at 11:08 pm PST<P>Dear Ferkl,<P>As I promised I am emailing you.

Why? because there was nowhere else to go. But there is now DAoC. And so he, and most of his guild, canceled their EQ accounts and are playing DAoC. That's about 20-30 accounts that are gone. Or roughtly $200-300 a month.<P>There is a conclusion to this story. You can <A HREF="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=18" TARGET=_blank>read about it</A> if you want. Just so you know, just about every viewed it as too little, too late.<P>There is a simple fact here. Verant lost a chunk of customers in one fell swoop and it was due to Verant CS. I think that had Ferkl just been given his epic back in the first place that most of them would still have active EQ accounts. Instead, they chose to waste tons of time blaming Ferkl for what is clearly a design flaw with the EQ client (one that has supposedly been fixed) and, as such, his and his friends' money now goes to Mythic. <P>It took an act from Smedley himself to get this resolved properly. CS should be better than that. As The Tick on <A HREF="http://slownewsday.net" TARGET=_blank>SND.net</A> noted, it's unlikely that Smed or any other number of VI execs wants this kind of CS. The problem is that their <A HREF="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=28" TARGET=_blank>handling</A> of <A HREF="http://slownewsday.net/story.php?story=32" TARGET=_blank>correspondance</A> leaves much to be desired.<P>It's not just these recent events either. The events from last Halloween and the <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=2839" TARGET=_blank>response</A> are still some that stick out in my mind.<P>What's my point? Currently, DAoC isn't an EQ killer. It's something new to try but I haven't seen massive numbers flocking there. Unless Verant drove them there. Verant is currently its own worst enemy and, ironically, they are the ones who have the power to make DAoC successful.<P>If they are serious about fixing CS (the #1 complaint about EQ) then EQ may very well live on. But if it's lip service EQ may being to hemorrage from all the attrition leading people to DAoC.<P>Only time will tell.<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>All my experiences with Verant CS have been positive save the RoK on-line ordering thingy. Not too shabby for having played since beta 4. <P>But i guess they have trained me well. Hehe. Cause in my opinion, that guy messed up. He looted with a full inventory and there was nowhere for it to go. Case closed. Call it a bug, design flaw, whatever, if you want. I know better than to do that, therefore i pay attention and don't put myself in that position (i.e. i loot weapons/armor first so there is zero chance of them dropping. also i always loot the pack that contained my soul-bound keys first (after wearable equipment), put keys back, then loot the rest of my packs). Bottom line, he made a mistake and paid for it. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>That is pretty damn harsh, Wisecleric, and I hope you never end up in a position with any customer relations responsibilities - you already sound just like a GM. It is a pretty damn big bug if you try to loot something, and it GETS DESTROYED instead of saying 'you don't have room' or similiar and leaving it on the corpse.<P>When I was sitting in Sol A camping Grimblox one night, after having been there for ~6hrs or so, I was tidying up my inventory and went to delete some junk. If you don't know, there are some small gaps in the mouse collision detection on the 'Confirm delete' box - if you click _just_ to the left of the yes/no bit it goes UNDER the whole dialog... So here's me with some crappy goblin loot on my pointer, hit delete and went to hit yes, but missed it slightly. The mouse click goes through the dialog, and onto my 8th inventory slot, swapping crappy_loot with my tink bag onto the cursor. And of course having seen that I missed the 'yes' button, I move the mouse slightly and hit it again, before my bored-to-tears brain notices that my tink bag is now on the cursor - bye bye tink.<P>The guide and eventual GM were both very courteous, but said they could not do anything since this was my fault. I agreed with them, it was obviously my fault for the 2nd click, although I was pretty annoyed at the shoddy dialog interface that made this possible. But who would it hurt for the GM to check the log, see that yes I had destroyed a tink bag, and just give me another one? I could not then, and still can't now, think of a SINGLE situation where anybody would actually want to delete a tink, and neither could the GM when asked.<P>Obviously this is not the same as losing an epic, but was just meant to show that there is so much room for improvement in the customer service we (dont) get... More MMOG competition is a damn good thing, since now Verant have to actually compete with something.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Zakalwe Soulwarden<BR>High Priest of Rivervale<BR>Grey Council, Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, I wouldnt want to suffer that Ranger's fate, and even though Wisecleric is right, if you take the proper precautions you can avoid things like this people will still make mistakes, and get tired, and frustrated or just slip up that one time... bang! yer pixels are gone =\<P>Something like this VI could do THEMSELVES a big favor and make the item stay on the corpse.  There's no reason to destroy it.  Until they go and do some work on the code, the only way I can see of protecting yourself is to be extra careful of looting your corpse, and containers.  Never carry a full inventory and dont be afraid to leave a bag on the corpse.  It doesnt all have to be looted in one second flat.  Grab yer keyholding bag, if possible use the same one EVERY time and refill it, always leave the 1st Main Inventory slot open if your doing ANY quest turn-in's and try to step back and take a breath before doing any thing in a hurry like turn ins, or looting.<P>Sorry it happened like this to that Ranger though, and I sure hope they fix this soon.  It's obviously a limitation of the game mechanics and something the players should not have to be penalized for.<P><BR>Grumbles</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>That sld.net article rings true with what my friends and I have experienced.

Guide contacts the druid, takes the shield from him and hands it to the SK, and puts a warning on the druids account w/ a 24 hour suspension ) all the way to 'whatchoo talkin bout willis?' ( VS ks'd from us with a mem-wipe, GM says that she looked into it and it looks a-ok to her, happy adventuring bubba )<P>Something makes their staff behave that erratically. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I don't understand why the item had to "drop" and thus poof.   I have tried to loot stuff off of my corpse before when my inventory was full because I had forgotten to move my keys to my key bag.  The items I tried to loot weren't no-drop, but it didn't even take them off of the corpse and drop them.. it just stood me back up and left everything on the corpse.  Why wouldn't it do the same with his sword?   Verant is very in the wrong here, especially when it is something that they can very easily look into the logs to verify.   It's not like they had to take his word for it that he had a sword.   /sigh<P><P>------------------<BR>Eachann Bronzeleaf<BR>Templar of Tunare, <BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Anyone who is looting a corpse was obviously on CR.  I know a lot about CR.  It sucks, it takes time, it usually happens on the "one last pull before we call it a night".<P>Customer service is a skill.  As such you're either good at it or you're not.  I've spent 5 years in Informtion Technology (IT -- computer dept) and IT consulting.  IT can be the shining star or the camel's ass of customer service.  The only thing it takes to change from bad to good is a little effort and consideration.  Want to know a dirty little secret?  End users prefer good customer service over good technical skills.<P>**** happens and it's the CS's job to make it come out smelling like roses.  No, they shouldn't fix intentional or abusive mistakes, but this Ranger looting issue wasn't either of those.  Clearly, this happened due to a shortcoming of the looting code.<P>Look at it this way:<P>1.  Ranger had sword<BR>2.  Ranger lost sword due to bug<BR>3.  Ranger wants sword back<P>As CS you can give him back the sword and solve the problem and make his day.  This isn't giving him something for nothing he had it to begin with.  He's already earned the damned thing.  <P>Or you can say "no, it's obviously your fault".  Why would you do that?  Do you think that'll teach him a lesson?  Maybe make him more careful next time so he doesn't lose his other epic sword?  He's already waited for his /petition to be answered, then he's waited for GM's to review logs and talk to their management.  There's nothing more this guy could learn from this.  Refusing to restore it is assinine.<P>Verant doesn't allow you to buy "insurance" for your items.  And given the 100+ RL 24-hour days it likely took to level a ranger to 50+ w/ epic, you're bound to slip on the mouse at least once.<P>Many companies have risen and fell based soley on customer service.  Take Dell versus Compaq computers.  Both make *relatively* the same quality computers.  However Dell has a MUCH better customer service record and has taken a lot of business away from Compaq based only on that point.<P>Another example?  Take Southwestern Airlines and any other major airline.  The other airlines are losing customers every day to Southwest based soley on customer service.<P>Verant can dig in their heals and continue to have an unbending CS policy, but it has hurt them in the past and will continue to hurt them in the future unless they change.  Good CS often goes unnoticed, but bad CS is long remembered.<P>-Fuz<BR>58 Templar, Sol Ro.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wise,<P>To a certain extent you are right. People should be careful. It's amazing how many people aren't careful and don't take responsibility.<P>But there are some issues you're neglecting...<P>First, this is a design flaw in a program. The game is coded to drop items that attempt to go into inventory. Since No Drop items cannot be dropped, the game basically creates its own conundrum and resolves it by poofing the item. Common sense says to be more careful but coding desn't quite work like that.<P>As a programmer, I find I spend a large portion of time trying to make sure that the dumbest person on the planet could run it without breaking it. That's why you do things like beta testing. You let people run it for a while to find the bugs you missed. It doesn't matter how common sense can avoid the error, the fact of the matter is if Joe Stupid can screw up the software, that's a lost customer.<P>In this case we have a user who encounters a design flaw (it's not technically a bug, it was intentionally coded this way) and when he reports it he gets told "We meant for it to do that. You should have been more careful. You're SOL, goodbye." In other words, blame the customer for not avoiding the flaw. Not even Microsoft blames its customers for the flaws in its software.<P>Secondly, THIS IS NOT DOCUMENTED. There's no part of the manual telling you this. It doesn't matter how easy it is to avoid, if you don't tell people it's there then they can't avoid it. I know I'd never heard of this problem before this.<P>Third, there is inconsistancy here. Just about every other looting system in the game has a safety net to prevent this EXCEPT looting your own corpse. If there were no safety nets at all maybe VI would have had a leg to stand on but they don't.<P>The bottom line is this. CS blamed a customer for an undocumented flaw in their own software when other similar systems prevent it. It also took an act from the highest person in the company to set it straight. Somewhere, something in CS is broken. And SND.net certainly seems to have a plausible explaination why...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wisecleric keeps going on and on about the guy's inventory being full. But wasn't it the case that his weapon slots were free, and whichever sword (swiftwind or eathcaller) that can go in both slots went into his off-hand, leaving the other one which was offhand only to not be able to go there on a right-click? I'm not up on ranger epics, but that was how I understood it.<P>Regardless, I'm sure a lot of folk have learned to take more care when looting, it's just a shame that someone had to go through so much crap to get it done.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Zakalwe Soulwarden<BR>High Priest of Rivervale<BR>Grey Council, Xev</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I hope that VI is sincere in improving it's cust. service, as it is very important for them to keep players in their game... Over time, however, the best customer service possible may still not save A GAME from stagnating.. lets face it unless the game continues to evolve, entertain, and intrigue us, as customers we will eventually get bored, loose interest, and look elsewhere for new adventures.  <P>In relating to the rangers quest, I agree it was very poor CS to not immediately look into the logs, check out verification of what happened, and then return his epic to him.. Anyone that has spent the time and effort to achieve their epic should not be so short changed by such a puny glitch in the game.  <P>Lastly, VI had a good incident in relation to cust. service occur last night on our server.. Our guild took down Vox last night, and a player that was outside the guild ninja'd the white scale and logged... Needless to say this upset most all the ones in attendance, and petitions were sent.. <P>Approx half hour later a GM checked the logs of the suspected thief, .. confirmed it did happen, removed the scale, and returned it to the raid leader to be given to the person who rightfully should have received the scale.   I would have to say that is the best action I have seen a GM do in my three years in game.. I don't know if the ninja'd person is suspended or not, but at least the item was returned to the person who deserved it.  <P>Dusklar 60th High Priest of Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007319&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007319&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
