<br />
It took us 3 attempts to succeed, and we only did because we were REAL lucky. <br />
<br />
What strategies do other people use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">04-08-2001, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The queen doesn't have a lot of HP, like 18-20k, but she is capable of killing a very large number of people very quickly. Due to how devastating her AE is most people find it preferable to fight her with a small number of people with very tightly controlled agro.<br />
The hard part is clearing out her guards, you will need to have more than one puller so that you can chain FD pull her guards away from her. We usually set up out in the hall in the corner by the fake wall.<br />
Once we have her down to 1 or 2 guards we quickly set up our fight team. Generally the team is 3 warriors, 3-4 clerics, every mage on the raid, 2-3 wizards and one enchanter. If there are 3 or more mages, I like using only one warrior and having all the clerics focused on him. Also there will usually be 2-3 suicide paladins involved. Can do it with fewer, but it sucks to be one of the people sitting outside in the hall, so we include as many people as its safe to. =)<br />
The critical thing is for the warriors, preferably only one of them, to hold agro through the entire fight. Pick one warrior to be the primary tank, have them engage and start off with riposte disciplin to build agro. after the Queen's first AE, a palladin uses LoH on the warrior then uses DA to cut his agro. Once riposte is gone, warrior should go defensive, at this point, at this its at least 2 clerics should be spamming CH at him, its handy for a pally to be standing by with LoH incase he gets to low. Any paladins involved need to be right at the warrior when they LoH and be ready to DA to get agro off them. The paladins should also understand that they will not be getting cleric heals, so once they LoH and get agro off them, they should back out of AE range, or die, thier option. The idea behind this is to prevent the queen from bouncing around after clerics, when we use this tactic to control agro MOBs don't generally even bat an eyelash at the clerics.<br />
Mage pets are very handy because they are imune to the AE. Need an enchanter to mez the extras in the room and any spawn. A couple of wizards are handy to blast her when she gets low on hp. She has a disgusting tendancey to run very fast out of her room and up the ramp when she gets low. About the time she hits the top of the ramp, she gets healed through the walls, stops and gates. I realy recommend you prevent that, about 2k in nukes is plenty to finish her off as she is about to run.  =)<br />
<br />
We usually have about 12 in for the fight. She can be done with less, but who cares, its more fun to include people. I don't recommend having more involved with the fight due to possible agro problems. The key is keeping at least 1 warrior alive and keeping the queen agro on him. Also keeping the clerics and casters out the AE is critical. <br />
<br />
Paladins involved in the fight are there only to help prevent prevent agro on clerics.<br />
Imediatly translocate, and ban from future raids, any ranger that decides to stand with the clerics and see how much damage he can do with trueshot....<br />
Once you kill the queen, its easy to keep the area clear pulling to her room. Keep an eye on the time and have everyone out of her room and ready for the fight with her 1 and 3/4 hours after she dies. Spawn time is suposed to be 2 hours, but she usually spawns about 10 min early for us.<br />
GL and have fun.  =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">04-09-2001, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow!  Interesting tactics!<br />
<br />
Only problem I would forsee is getting everyone to understand their part.  <br />
<br />
We had a LOT of problems getting the guards cleared.  In fact, most of our problems stem from this.  Many times the queen would show up after we pulled some guards to the pit where the King spawns.  That always wiped us out.<br />
<br />
I think we ended up charging the room when there were 4-6 guards still up.  Somehow even though the enchanters were all dead, the guards were mez'd.  I ressed the dead warrior wanting the queen blade and he was able to loot it before a guard killed him.<br />
<br />
Quite an epic battle...  Truly what we lacked in tactics we made up for in persistance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">04-10-2001, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After looking at this again for a bit I have one question, how do the clerics survive the AE?  Can you be out of range of the AE and still be in range for heals?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">04-10-2001, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes The Queens AE is very short range (it also is line of sight).  If you fight her at her throne clerics can stand right at the door and heal and not be in the AE range.  The biggest trick to this is allowing the main tanks you send in to build enough aggro so that the Queen doenst go after the clerics that are healing.<br />
<br />
Of course if you have enough high level melee, you can just go with guns blazing.  Send all your tanks in a rush with their offensive discipline.  Wizards nuke hard.  Since queen only has something like 26K hp she goes down super fast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemean</div><div class="date">09-24-2001, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The way we did the queen literally 10 minutes ago, was to main tank her.<br />
<br />
Lv60 warrior - buffed to the gills - 5 clerics healing him (complete overkill).  He went in, pinned her against the throne, and whacked on her.  We stayed back against the doorway and healed, and it was stupidly easy.  I was on spot heals, and the tank never got below 80% health, so I didn't bother healing him, and started nuking.<br />
<br />
Main Tanking is the way to go for Queen.  Especially coz shes got so few hit points (18K or so) a tank with good weapons can pretty much solo her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gryfalia</div><div class="date">09-24-2001, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to be honest, we Zerg her.<br />
<br />
Ya, sounds lame, but it works and works fast.<br />
<br />
Of course, for our guild, a Zerg is 25+ (we tend to go<br />
in with 28 or so to hit the Royals, and lose 2-3 due to<br />
time as we get in).  So we hit her with 26 or 27 and<br />
go all out offense.  We make sure that everyone has enough<br />
HP to withstand one AoE and everyone, and I mean <br />
EVERYONE, nukes her.  Clerics too.  We can get off<br />
2 nukes for over 1K total each, before she gets the second<br />
one off.  With tanks on offensive and Rogues doing <br />
whatever it is they do, and Rangers using Trueshot, etc, she<br />
dies.<br />
<br />
Pulling…is…everything…<br />
<br />
Get her guards OUT of there.  2 remaining ones are<br />
dealt with by the enchanters (who usually tash, mez and<br />
try to avoid death).  3 enchanters are good, 1 to annoy<br />
the queen, 2 for the guards.<br />
<br />
The last time I went in with guild to kill her no one died (that<br />
I recall) taking her out.  I think one person died as we took <br />
out her guards and a few that had repopped joined in (from<br />
outside).  After that you just keep pulling to her room until the<br />
king spawns again.<br />
<br />
Funfun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">09-24-2001, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">way we do it is to put all the tanks with a cleric or two.  Have enchanters superior invis and pick out a mob or two to mez.  SK's invis and go into room and target queen.  Call is given and sk's harm touch queen for instant agro, everyone then rushes room.  Clerics spam group heal (will end up with cleric tankage by end :&gt;), and everyone else nukes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're going to try the invis all tanks, tanks surround queen then all attack using offensive discs scenario.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to try my group CH spell on this tactic. Keep those invul keys close.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">10-02-2001, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight we did this:<br />
<br />
3 enchanters (60, 60 and 59) invis and pretarget targets to mez.  They coordinate so they don't all get the same target.<br />
<br />
Cleric DA's and runs in, gets aggro and dives to the back of the room.  Tanks run in and pin queen.  Enchanters mez then charm the other 3.  Everyone is on the queen then.  She dies and we mop up the guards.  It worked flawlessly except someone ended up aggroing the king room on us, which we thought we could just leave alone.  (Ok, next time we'll pull it).  <br />
<br />
We had terrible luck trying to split the guards out first in prior attempts.  I love the idea of SK doing an HT too.  <br />
<br />
We did end up killing the queen and all ended happily.<br />
<br />
FYI:  We always camp out a cleric and a rogue in the safe hall for CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">10-04-2001, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh!  Last night we went again.  This time we were short on enchanters but got a level 60 bard.  Lulling the queen worked great!  We were able to split off 4 of the guards without a problem!<br />
<br />
BTW: We were killing lots of uber mobs but Queen always gave us a lot of trouble.  So we had two amazing Queen raids in a row.  My confidence is restored.  <br />

When she is alone, send a paladin in with DA to take the first AE, then everyone rush, clerics stay out of AE range and heal. She can only AE every X seconds if I recall, so if you take her down fast you are set.<br />
