<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baerum</div><div class="date">04-14-2000, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here I have read many ideas on both sides of these arguments. I am only 24th and have yet to even get revive, but I have my future planned out for me as such.<br />
<br />
I will hotkey that I reserve revives for my guild, my group, o those who show dedication to the church (aka donations). I will never CHARGE any set amount, but will make it apparent that I expect SOME show of recompensations for the effort.<br />
<br />
Once I get XP rez, the hotkey will also state this. Then the guild and group get XP rez, while others get revive, unless they truly show dedication to the causes of my faith.<br />
<br />
Untill we get a rez that only restores XP based on how close the subjects faith is to our own, I will adopt this stance. I am eagerly awaiting Diety specific items and hope that they allow some visible characteristics for others to identify. A paladin with a shield bearing a crest of My faith will get a full REZ no questions asked every time! Would it truly be too hard for an icon for each fith to be in each zone database (simple black and white icon) to place on all cleric and pally shields or breastplated for ID? It is my faith and I am proud of it, why can I not show a symbol of my dedication to others?</div></div><hr />
