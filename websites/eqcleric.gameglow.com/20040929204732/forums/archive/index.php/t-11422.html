Now your just getting petty Croff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croff</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with the Druids who seem to post here, telling us what we should want-get. I thought that maybe it would be fun to give some thoughts on what they should want-get.<br />
<br />
Thats why I posted this under the fu_king rant section.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Windfire</div><div class="date">08-30-2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Druids get many forms of invis but the one you speak of does happen to a druid for a while. At young levels a druid has camo which only works outside. Later on we get super camo which can work anywhere. <br />
<br />
Then in even later levels we get Improved Cammo which is self only and doesnt break until you break it. Then Foliage Shield which is group camo.<br />
<br />
Then finally my favorit Innate Cammo which is an AA ability. Its insta invis, no cast time, never breaks until you break it.. with a 7 second refresh time.. Rangers get this ability aswell. This is one amazing ability, I use it all the time.<br />
<br />
You have to look at it as not invisability.. you look at it as a druid blending in to his/her surroundings.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Croff</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hakken  your an idiot... read your own posts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I say when they nerf all of the other druids abilities such as SOW, snare, quading, porting, invis, ds etc then they can be 75% as good as us. &quot;<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
&quot;Nerfing another class should never be an option.&quot;<br />
<br />
You get the big STFU of the year award !!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't agree with the original idea.. but yes, we should nerf classes when its necessary. This is all about class balancing, right? If we need balance, then some classes are too powerful, and some are less powerful. If we don't lessen some powers, then all we can do is improve powers. Then we get closer to trivializing the game, and making all classes the same.<br />
<br />
Since players in general don't like nerfs,  it should be done as little as possible, but nerfing should be an option. (Why do we call it 'nerfing' anyways.. far too negative a tone)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">09-01-2002, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes croff I said that.  Now how about you post the one where I said I was wrong.<br />
<br />
Nerfing is not the answer,   building our class up more is.  Too many clerics complain about just being a CH bot and watching tv while playing.   This is our chance to expand and there are a lot of good post on that on our own board here.  <br />
<br />
I was wrong.   I would rather see the constructive side than nerfing other classes.<br />
<br />
The problem as has been pointed out to me in the general EQ section (stop the madness) is that many of our own brethern are starting to think we sound like whining 18 year olds.  Unfortunately when our own can no longer realize that many people are only trying to keep the class interesting enough to play, we have a problem.   How can we convince Verant that we need changes when our own class now believes that we should leave well enough alone and take whatever they give us?<br />
<br />
By not calling for nerfs and presenting well though out arguments instead, we would have a better chance of winning our own brethern back let alone Verant.</div></div><hr />

But being negative will only cause more fellow clerics to split off from us.</div></div><hr />
