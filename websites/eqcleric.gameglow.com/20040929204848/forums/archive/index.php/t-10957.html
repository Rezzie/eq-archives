<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-03-2002, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So last night we were futzing around in Akheva and took out the Summoned Burrower.  We, er, didn't know any better =).  For those who haven't touched him he's 61-62, hits for 500+, but can be slowed.  It was a cake fight and the loots sucked accordingly.  We were looking for a challenge for our new 4-man Rogue army, but he wasn't it.<br />
<br />
My question is just how much more difficult is the Restless Burrower (the version that spawns after the Summoned has been left alone for a few days)?  Is he slowable?  Is he guaranteed to make a slimy spot out of SKs?<br />
<br />
One more question: do those untargetable mobs that are inside the Summoned Burrower disappear once the Restless has spawned?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info supplied.<br />

Only marginally more difficult than the summoned burrower.  An SK can tank it fine.  Loot is worlds better than summoned one, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks for the info.  We spent a fair amount of time getting set up for our first real MT type of fight (er, MT other than Exeter) and it was a real let down.  And as usual Ex wound up tanking (got tired of listening to Dart say &quot;Ow!&quot; -- the Taunt button just sucks).<br />
<br />
Thanks for info.</div></div><hr />
