</FONT><HR>Well, my guild had been toying with the idea of VP for a while now.<P>We had gone in and looked around a little and we had fought the weakest dragon of the bunch, Silverwing a couple of times.<P>This past weekend, we decided to make a full-blown assault and we were going to try to clear it.<P>Notes on Silverwing: Enchanter Dragon. You would guess that it messes and charms right? Well, no. Her AE attack is a gravity flux spell, which is a good thing for clerics, imo.<P>When you are facing AE’s that are pure damage, you can use Group Hero and Word of Vigor as heals instead of Word of Restoration. (I don’t think WOR is a good heal for Silverwing, since you are paying mana-wise for the cures that don’t do anything.)<P>They very FIRST time we went into VP, ever, we killed Silverwing with 23 people. That’s not to say we are elite or anything, just to show you that she is not much of a threat.<P>MR resists are useful, but if you get hit with the AE, its no big deal anyway since you can just heal it off. <P><BR>Now comes the hard part.<P>To do most of VP, you need to clear the annoying dragon Hoshkar.<P>Hoshkar is a shaman dragon, and you would think that he uses cold and slows, right? Well no, he has a disease based AE/DD. 1250 a pop DD with a Slow on and DOT as well.<P>Oh, and he Charms too. Such fun. he charmed a cleric of ours that kept healing Hoshkar's stupid pet.<P>HOSHKAR IS THE HARDEST DRAGON BY FAR, BUT THE SECOND ONE YOU MUST FIGHT.<P>So once you clear this joker, the rest of VP is easy enough.<P>He gates as well. I will tell you that it took us 6 tries at him with a total wipeout each time to develop our strategy for him. Another large guild on our server had a similar experience. He is very, very tough and is much harder than any other dragon there. In my opinion, Silverwing is a wussy, and is like some of the wanderers in Western Wastes, not tough at all. Trakanon is a fairly tough dragon that can wipe you out if you get sloppy. Hoshkar requires precision and teamwork, and there is no room for error!<P>His AE was vicious and you NEED to use Word of Restoration as much as you can. Drop AC for this fight and go nuts on HP and DR. (Since you are the cleric and will always be in range of your own WOR, I think it’s a valid strategy to go all +HP on this guy, as I did. Some may disagree on that, I’m sure.) I took off my Donal’s BP and went EM (for +STA and +HP) used my COV Bracer of Hammerfall, +65HP rings, etc…<P>You may get off 3-4 WOR’s and maybe a group hero as a heal before you go OOM. If you go in too early into the fight, the tanks will not have sufficient aggro built up and you will die on your first WOR.<P>Forget trying to Counteract Disease on this dragon, as it will take too many casts of your spell to wipe it out and meanwhile 4 others in your group are dying. You NEED to do WOR, no way around it. If you are not level 57, get it. You need that spell.<P>Once Hoshkar is dead, you can move to the “pool room” which is where the Ring Of Scale has its councils. A fine pulling area it is!<P>Xygoz is next, a golden colored bardic dragon. AE is a silence spell that stops spellcasting. Nice thing is that tanks can go all +haste, +ac, +hp they want, since silence does nothing to them. Xygoz melee output is low and the silence lasts about 10 seconds.<P>The strategy is obvious, casters stay out of range of the AE, lol. Xygoz died to us in less than 30 seconds on our first pull and no one even died.<P>Druushk is a Ranger dragon, and is therefore useless and easy to kill. Lasted about 20-25 seconds. Killed him on our first pull ever, and he was no threat at all. Seriously. I wish I could tell you what his AE was, how hard it hit for and all that, but he died too fast and no one took any damage from him at all.<P>Next was Nexona, a fearsome SK dragon. Nexona did an AE that SOUNDS like Poison (you are hit by an Acid Blast, or something like that) but in fact, it’s Fire based. It’s some kind of DD plus a snare. One again, you only need to worry about pure healing here, no cures, as they won’t affect the snare. MR and FR are the way to go.<P>Finally, you will face the pansy leader of the Ring of Scale, a CLERIC dragon! What does that mean? Well, besides the occasional CH, she will also gate. AE is a 900 point DD and about a 10-14 second stun. Go PURE MR on this one. I advise giving up almost all other stats for MR in this case. Nice thing about a clerical dragon? Once again, pure heals only. Don’t waste mana on a WOR, use Word of Vigor or Group Hero. The stuns did seem to interrupt casting, unlike a silence so that stinks, and remember if you have a bard and the bard get stunned, he stops singing and you lose added MR as well! So watch your bards!<P>We had no troubles interrupting her CH and gating attempts, she tried 5 times. But in the end, she too ended up taking a dirt nap.<P>We had a good mix of people on our trip, about 45-50 people, all of them 54+, most of them 57+. Clerics, bards, wizards, heavy melee seemed critical for the zone in general. We spent two days there, on the first day we did Silverwing in a few minutes then spent HOURS devising our methods on Hoshkar. The next day we did Hoshkar and cleared the zone in less than 12 hours. Not bad considering it was our first attempt, ever!<P>I hope this has been of some use to you.<P><BR>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.kriegeronline.com" TARGET=_blank>Krieger</A><BR>Tunare Server is my uber-guild<p>[This message has been edited by Alliliel (edited 04-22-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Nice on Phara Dar.  For us Hoshkar goes down easily (just a handful of deaths), but Phara Dar is still giving us fits.<P>A couple notes on the group heals:<P>49 <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=779" TARGET=_blank>Word of Healing</A>: 4sec 600 mana for 500 hp = 1.20 mana per hp, 125 hp/sec<BR>52 <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=785" TARGET=_blank>Heroic Bond</A>: 3.5sec 420 mana for 400 hp = 1.05 mana per hp, 114 hp/sec<BR>52 <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=783" TARGET=_blank>Word of Vigor</A>: 4.25sec 750 mana for 620 hp = 1.21 mana per hp, 146 hp/sec<BR>57 <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=802" TARGET=_blank>Word of Restoration</A>: 4.5sec 900 mana for 750 hp = 1.20 mana per hp, 167 hp/sec<P>- Word of Healing, Vigor and Restoration have the same mana/hp.<BR>- hp/sec: In an AE situation where you are chain-casting group heals (which shouldn't be often if your group has good resists), and you don't have time for Word of Redemption (or can't cast it like me :P), Word of Restoration provides the biggest bang for the buck.  If you're forced to chain cast the group heal then it's probably because the group is dropping faster than you can heal them.  hp/sec is a huge consideration.<P>At 58, I use Word of Healing and Word of Restoration for group heals on ae targets.  I tend to use WoR as my staple group heal.  It gives me a more leisurely pace to keep everyone alive.  I can spot heal those falling faster than the rest in between.  Also, because of its higher mana cost, if specialization kicks in I'm saving more mana.  Word of Healing I keep up for when my mana starts to thin and my goal is to keep as many in the group alive as possible, not necessarily healthy.<P>Far too often groupmates at raids (especially VP) get Aegolism or get swapped in from a group with a higher level cleric and heroic bond won't stick on at least one person.  With specialization and the hp/sec I don't feel too guilty tossing some extra mana for a 100hp boost in a group heal.  But yeah in an idea situation heroic bond is an incredible group heal.<P>But every cleric heals differently.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Our Druushk fights we win almost seem like luck, as in if the casters and light tanks can resist the massive AE, but if they don't we pretty much get waxed.  What do you have people run their MR at for Druushk?  About every other dragon we've killed with adds too (ok never had an add with silverwing).  *shrug* But Druushk solo has probably killed us now as often as Hoskar.

</FONT><HR>Hmm, possibly.  Athough these haven't been guild events really.  Just a collection of many high lvl players from alot of different guilds that all sort of grew up together on the server at the same time.  We have been very light on heavy tanks (ie warriors...last raid we didn't even have 1 60th lvl warrior with us, just a 58th lvl 1 I think...probably most we had was 3 60th lvl warriors one raid).  But yeah, aside from mistakes on Hoskar, the biggest pain in the butt dragon on my 4 or 5 VP trips has been Druushk.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum20&number=20&thisthread=000045&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum20&number=20&thisthread=000045&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
