<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">12-28-1999, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oi as a follow up to me post titled &quot;OI HERE&quot;S AN IDEA&quot;<br />
 Here's a thread for us to contructively post our top ten celric problems.<br />
 Note: Anything to do with Temple of Ro Armor counts as one problem only.<br />
  Think.<br />
  Then list yer problems with this class from  all yer level's perspectives that ye've seen so far. We don't want to forget the troubles we had at lower levels.<br />
<br />
  Me goes first. (Oi if ye have's a problem with me common bite a Rock! I'm a hill dwarf and non too much smarter than a troll, but way way wiser. Me pa says that comes from dying allot...that or drinking so much that all the weak brain cells die off leaving me with only dah good ones.)<br />
<br />
 Here  goes.<br />
<br />
 1- After Chosing a diety (Choose Brell-subliminal message) not much seems to happen for a player other than starting factions. Der Gods don't give em quests of their own to do, and the starter quests for dwarven clerics to get faction seems to be a Paladin designed quest as are all the other (One-two?) that Priestess galatea gives out.<br />
 Translation: Other races need more quests from their own temples for their own gods.<br />
<br />
2- Clerics for different gods aren't unique enough. No special powers granted by the Clerics chosen diety. I could see Followers of the Prince of Fire getting a boon to their fire resist... No Special spell grouping. Tunarians should get better healing spells? Cheaper mana? (A coded in specialization bonus base to start with?)<br />
 Love gods getting lull/Soothe series spells earlier, or a love spell? Minor Charm, causes NPC to fall in love with you and folow you around bugging you, if you ignore him to long he/she it feels spurned...heh heh.<br />
 As fer us Dwarves, Brell forger of the world, why not give us dwarves supposedly the best smiths in all Norrath the ability to forge magic weapons too? Or Bless them instead of the person. &quot;Yer not worthy of me God's Divine Armor Darkie, but use this rusty sword I have blessed to slay goblins... (note  weapons disappears after logging--would be good for FS weapons too-mebbe longer lasting.)<br />
TRANSLATION MAKE CLERICS LESS GENERIC-THEY HAVE DIFFERENT GODS-GIVE EM DIFFERENT POWERS!<br />
<br />
3- TEmple of Ro ARmor Quests..hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. I Ain't doing them! Bastards destroyed half of Antonica, creating deserts forcing elves to flee and become our neighbors. PAH! HARUMPH! Anyways dey take to damn long and is too tough fer yer average cleric to even consider doing. Too damn expensive too! Not even making comments on Pallie Armor, PFAGHHH! Need Enchanters? PFAAGHH!<br />
Translation-the armor sucks, the quests suck and they give no experience. (see Temple quests needed for each race and deity)<br />
<br />
4- Without nerfing other classes, how can we be more efective and less of constant med n heal mana bandaids? Dis suposed to be fun? starring at me book while me friends whack everything around them? I see more of me spell book den Norrath Proper. Thank Brell I can at least play with me spell book and peruse me inventory to check how much Dwarven ale I got left.<br />
Translation. Clerics are becoming more of a chore than fun. Competition with druids and shaman due to healing capabilities in the 29-28 range makes for trouble in finding groups and HAVING FUN. <br />
<br />
5- HAMMERS OF WRATH WE CAN THROW!! DOn;t think I've ever seen a weapon I can throw but once in combat...rusty types and the odd FS that is making me overweight.<br />
 These hammers suck as is, and are good for emergencies when running to yer corpse again through gobber territory! Smashem ALL! ooops sorry, me dwarvish is up...heh heh.<br />
 Could dey be made into pets? A floating hammer o'Brell...ohh lookie it's only like enchanter pets. No control and with Range of 10ft.<br />
 Mebbe ye can med, mebbe ye can't...how long will that hammer last? (insert Jeopardy theme music...okay ne'ermind)<br />
 translation: Fix our hammer series make them more effective or change them.<br />
<br />
6 FIX THINGS YOU PROMISED TO FIX IN A TIMELY MANNER.<br />
 AKA = our friggin DETECT MAGIC SPELL- damn useless friggin Spell. HERE&quot;S THE SLOT TO ADD either DIVINE MAGIC AURA-which would let us check nature, pantheon and some extra info about them no drop items we have, or to learn a bit more of the weapons true purpose.<br />
 All we have to do now is rightclick dah item- OI IT's a MAGIC DAGGER OF USELESS TO CLERICS.....no drop...hmmm destroy, give to me temple...or keep it&amp;gt;?<br />
Translation: Umm do I have too?<br />
<br />
7- HOW ABOUT A TITHE BUTTON: WOOOHOO a way we can donate to our temples to keep them strong and pay for that new marble column Priestess Galatea so wanted by her office. Got to feed dem dwarves and that HOLY WATER o'Brell ain't cheap ye know.<br />
 Talk about a way to remove money from the GAME. <br />
 Clerics can also sacrifice magic items to their GODS. GODS of Love would get wine, food, ummmm...Gods of Wars weapons of their defeated...BRELL the Forger of the world gets let's say ARMOR we take from our enemies...<br />
This gets rid of extra armor in dah game.<br />
 Allow followers of gods, who aren't clerics of said gods to goto said temples to make donations or sacrifices...<br />
 rewards? &amp;lt;Set approxiamte values to each few levels...Ahh Brother Joeseph, seems yer a bit behind in yer aide in stockpiling armor and tithes for Brell, we're running low on Brell's holy waters....<br />
  /tithe 12 34 445 768<br />
Why Thank you Brother Joeseph, is there anything we can do for you?<br />
 Or perhaps Divine aura requires good faith in yer god- and then NO STUNS either...to reset DA and DB- ye must make a worthy sacrifice to yer god. EFFECT- NO MANA NO CASTING TIME or a set duration.<br />
 Faction, more quests, and better yet, each server tallies the total donations of each diety. Everyso often a temple will fall to disrepair due to lack of funds (no available spells-can;t buy items ye want to sell etc) Or it goes to war (GM EVENT!!!!) against it's enemies- Brell vs Innorruk heh heh. (see champions of Brell website for dat storyline and pictures at members.home.net/brell PLUG WARNING!!!) this could lead to Clerics of each suddenly finding themselves PVP to the other churches...or subject to a GM driven raid. Results the fallen temple must rebuild it's membership with the locals, and regain consecration. MORE QUESTS!!!<br />
 Translation: A TITHE COMMAND TO ALLOW CLERICS TO DONATE EXTRA MONEY AND ITEMS TO THEIR CHURCH OF CHOICE&amp;gt; TITHE is for MONEYS DONATION  is used to doante items: this must be done in a temple proper or at an ABBY--yes add a few holy sights around norrath so that clerics can make pilgrameges--ohhh another quest?<br />
<br />
8- AC,Hitpoints,attack skills, defense, etc CAPS- For a plate wearing, in your face healers, during horrid battles, why have such low caps? Make each a variable depending on race, and deity- Clerics of Love gods- get better D than O, War Clerics get better O than D, the rest are even depending on what their gods represent.<br />
 Translation; review character class skill and level caps on AC-Hitpoint-attack-defense for clerics.<br />
 <br />
9-number nine number nine number nine number nine number nine.....<br />
translation: No more posts at 4 am EDT after too much coffee...<br />
<br />
10- Clerics need a shield attack, if not as effective as others they still need it.<br />
<br />
11- okay I said top ten, but number nine was plain silly: <br />
  Allow clerics to REFRESH CORPSE- In case of  server autodestructs and coming upon a low level person's corpse and they can't find it- this being a precursor to revive series.<br />
 REFRESH- effect The Corpse looks FRESHER...<br />
  translation- prevents untimely decay of a party members corpse due to long travel times at lower levels- basically extends or resets the decay timer for each corpse--yes this could be abused by nefarious groups to allow for longer rez'times...and NO it won't make a Necro's pet look or smell less offensive.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Perhaps I could pick up a divine gift that would allow me to tie my enemies shoelaces together and act as a kind of 30 second stun for me to pound him good or run away like a little girl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaydim Aashmodai</div><div class="date">01-22-2000, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man I'll rant..We're doing top 10, I'll just ramble along.<br />
<br />
Whats with this teleporting to a safe spot? When I zone, I expect to be on the other side of the zone wall, not somewhere else. I zoned out of MM and ended up next to shadowmen. Had no clue where I was...but luckily I was bound just outside MM..WRONG! I gate and end up in Kaladim! What the hell!? So I file a petition and they say they cant help me..talk about borked coding.<br />
<br />
Root for clerics should be stronger. I remember 'Hold Person' from my AD&amp;D days and man...that spell rocked. Our root should last longer...give us time to run cause we cant melee anyhow.<br />
<br />
As was stated before...Give us different powers for different gods. I follow Karana...I want to be able to maybe get a lightning spell...maybe make it rain.<br />
<br />
Sow for clerics...but call it Divine Speed or something like that. Man I move slow with armor on.<br />
<br />
Lasty...some spells should be reversable. Remember this evil trick from AD&amp;D? Reversing res would be death touch...I would like to have it, really  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif its not like you see clerics fighting Vox anyways...we are reading our books in the back of the room.<br />
<br />
Also, the centerfold in my spell book is boring. And I keep staring at it a lot!!<br />
