<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pantheus</div><div class="date">11-01-1999, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was anyone else around for the inky invasion NONevent?? Talk about an ill-conceived, poorly planned, ignorantly executed Mongolian Cluster [Circus]!!!!<br />
<br />
We sat around for over seven hours, with the drone of &quot;any minute now&quot; being pumped in like some kind of nausiating Muzak for the whole time, in HHP. Then some genious GM or guide announces that the fight is in Kith... oh goodie!! let's dump 200 people into Kith from EACH end!!! Yeehaw!<br />
To shorten the story, from what I can gather, 90+% of us crashed and spent the next half hour tryin to get back on. When we did manage to reconnect to the zone, we discovered it (the great big US vs the INKIES battle) was over, and evil managed to win. And at least one person managed to loot something of alledged value.<br />
Now I know that not everyone gets cool loot in a GM event... but at least everyone should have a CHANCE! A chance at SOMETHING... some exp, a few plat, some minor loot... SOMETHING! What did 99.9% of the probably 400 of us assembled for 5 to 7 hours get for our patience??... what amounts the THE FINGER!! From what I could gather from the other PO'd people I talked to... the vast majority of us didn't even SEE the alledged battle!<br />
Now before some Verant flunky comes running to their defense with &quot;but it's not their fault... that's too many people for the zone&quot;... NO DUH... so why plan something like THIS for THAT zone in the first place?!<br />
<br />
All that sunshine that's been blown in our general direction the last few weeks about how important customer service is, and how they wanna make gameplay as pleasant and entertaining as possible... shyeah! Nothin like waiting around for over 7 hours (I've never waited that long at a DOCTOR'S office for pity sake!!) to get &amp; see squat to make a payin customer happy! Next time there's an event (yes Verant, it's AN event, not A event, like we got to watch scroll across the top of the server login page for a half hour while we tried to get back in) my friends and I will probably run the other way. <br />
I hear this event took place on all servers, I hope the rest of you had better luck than Erollisi did. Just as a side not, a fellow guild mate somehow got picked as Commander of Tunare for this event, and the rest of us got to what him be hassled and flooded with tells from people who became irate after the first 3 hours of waiting... so a warning to you... if a GM tries to finger you as a key player in one of their fiascos... RUN!! LOG OFF!! Do whatever you hafta do to avoid being involved!! At least until the GMs demonstrate that they've acquired some intelligence, and can concieve of, plan and execute an event that won't crater the servers and give everyone an even chance at at least some exp and a few coins.<br />
<br />
BTW: last I talked to him, Zac (Commander of Tunare on Erollisi) has gotten squat for the roughly 10 hrs of time he participated in this mess. And if I'm not mistaken, he's in Europe and this thing ran deep into the early morning on his time zone, but he stuck with it because he believed his appointment was important to the rest of us trying to participate in the NONevent.</div></div><hr />

How many different events have taken place?  Where did they occur?  How many involved inkies?  Hmm, lets see.  I get no quests, no GM run events (sorry the one they ran in Befallen was a joke, was done by a bunch of whities on our server), and KOS most places.  Hmmm, starting to wonder why I am paying for this.</div></div><hr />

Yes I was thoroughly ticked... They picked 6 people as the &quot;chosen&quot;, we went there and the quest had already been DONE! WTF!!!! Dont get me ranting about that....But it was very unthrilling prospect at future GM run events. There only excuse was that we took to long.. Umm excuse me thats what happens when you thow 6 stangers together... The other group was all friends and was already together... Sheesh okay my rant is over..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">11-02-1999, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well congratulations. You have learned what <br />
many of us know already - if there is a GM event, run the hell in the other direction! <br />
Ever since a GM event in Unrest a month or so ago, where one of the GMs looted the four best items (some in bags!) from a very high level character's corpse... where my 30th level magic user could hardly hit the stupid GM characters... if you ain't level 50, run the other way! (if you are, go naked)<br />
<br />
Just a side note: the Kith event on RZ flooded the zone with undead from the Plane of Hate (apparently)... so all thru the zone, including right outside Rivervale, spawned every Norrath Night a horde of 30+ undead. Bad time to start that halfling character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So true! I was running back to civilization after camping in Perma. As I got to High Pass, I started hearing about a GM event there and began groaning and moaning about my bad choice. Why didn't I go through Gorge/Runny like I usually do ? Ugh.<br />
<br />
Sure enough it takes me 10 mins to get thru the last half of High Pass to Kithicor because of the vid lag induced by 40 or 50 players dog piling on 1 or 2 GM characters. I say again, ugh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannis</div><div class="date">11-05-1999, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Got news for you all... run even if you ARE LEVEL 50!  Some of my guild actually made it into HHP and kithcor (the 10% of us that didnt crash and get stuck trying to get back into Ecommons for an hour)and they actually were winning the fight with the &quot;bad guys&quot; until the GMs started using a ZONE WIDE AOE death spell... WHAM!!!! You have been slain by (insert favorite NPC character here). No matter WHERE YOU WERE IN THE ZONE you were DEAD! Worse than that with the sheer number of mobs in there corpse retreival and ressing was impossible... Also, most of the people that died died 3-4 times and actually LOST EXPERIENCE when they were killed.. Some of our guildmembers actually lost entire levels... and heaven help anyone who happened to be bound in Rivervale SHEESH... can you say multiple deaths?<br />
<br />
Anyway just wanted you guys to know that it was the same for everyone, us level 50s didnt get spared anymore than you were... Evil was meant to win and by damn the GMs were gonna make sure it DID even if it meant cheating (imho).<br />
<br />
OH btw... In PoF now Cazic Thule has a new Word of Death spell.. he shouts your name and your instantly DEAD period. Fun Fun fun (NOT!)<br />

There's no way &quot;good could have defeated evil&quot;... because that would have messed up their little show to open the Plane of Hate. Yes folks... a full-blown, didn't have a chance to win, wait on yer butt for 9 hrs to die... setup!</div></div><hr />
