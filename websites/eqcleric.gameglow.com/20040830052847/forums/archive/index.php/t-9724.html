<br />
I'm in a bummer mood.<br />
<br />
I've worked really really hard to get my cleric up to level 29, a level rightfully I should be proud of. I know that a lot of people have multiple level 50 characters, but for someone who is running an office and raising three children, I felt deservedly like I'd really accomplished something. <br />
<br />
But now I find that but for the continued thrill of &quot;leveling&quot; that I have nothing to look forward to that doesn't depress me immensely. <br />
<br />
I realistically can't look forward to questing for the new class-specific armor. I simply cannot camp 7-8 hours at a time for multiple items. The Bilge website seems to<br />
suggest that people have sought him alone for upwards of 50 hours. (I guess Verant<br />
livened up the 7-hour Kithicor stump watch quite a bit by placing undead mobs in the<br />
zone that I cannot possibly survive for a few more levels, especially since many cleric<br />
spells in the zone do less than full damage consistently). Real life simply doesn't allow that type of play for me, and truthfully,<br />
even contemplating this after my massive failed Journeyman boot camp (which I wrote<br />
about on the EQ board two months ago) is enough to make my head swim with nausea.  So no cleric armor for me, at least not through quests.<br />
<br />
I cannot look forward to obtaining the non-cleric quest items that have come to<br />
symbolize all the hard work that one must put into this game. There are lots of reasons<br />
for this. First and foremost, it seems that every time I get to a level financially where I feel deservedly proud (currently 600 plat in bank), I find that my hard work and savings are worthless in the player driven economy. Today, I found out that even the most modest of mid-level to high level items, gatorscale leggings, was worth 1100 platinum.<br />
A bloodstained tunic, 500. This is of course from the couple of players who were even<br />
offering anything for sale, as opposed to for trade. (Just for the record, I have nothing<br />
valuable to trade, at least not that valuable). That's the second depressing part. Even all the plat in the world does not grant me access to anything that is special (to me at least, but &quot;basic equipment&quot; to most powergamers) in the game.<br />
<br />
I certainly am not looking forward to Hell level 1 (level 30). I have had every one of my friends almost quit the game over levels 30-31, 35, 40 and 45. These are undoubtedly<br />
major milestones, but if they are so special why am I dreading them like the plague?<br />
<br />
I don't look forward to growing proportionately poorer and poorer while those who powergame and then rape the economy with delusions about what items are worth<br />
continue to be rewarded for their powergaming, obsessive focus on playing as long as possible to acquire as many levels and as many items-for-sale-that-are-used-only-by-other-types-of-classes-as possible. I know, these things shouldn't bother me. But they do. I don't like the &quot;rich get richer/poor get poorer syndrome&quot; in my real life and it is chafing to an extreme in a game that is supposed to be fun for everyone. All I ask for is the ability to obtain the same reward for my $10 that others do, with reasonable effort. But it appears that is impossible, given the current structure of the game and the direction that Verant continues to travel in it with it.<br />
<br />
And as I mentioned recently on EQ board I definitely don't look forward to the ongoing requests for multiple zone travel for revives (someday resurrection if I keep playing that long). I have decided that it would interfere with my game play too much to be /anon all the time, and send the wrong message. So I shall always be visible, and thus, always be<br />
asked for the unreasonable.<br />
<br />
I am not looking forward at all to soon being forced to hunt in zones where trains are<br />
lord, all spawns are camped and no one wants to group with a cleric they don't even know (my friends are all but one significantly higher level so they hunt different places<br />
for the most part than I do).<br />
<br />
So what is there to look forward to? I have even started alternate characters and have 2 up to 9 and 10, hoping that the new strategies and thinking required would<br />
respark my excitement about EQ. But all these two characters have done is painfully<br />
remind me how difficult it will be once these characters hit level 20 or so. I get tired<br />
just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
OK this was admittedly a whine and a long one at that. What can be done to make it better? I'm not sure. But I do wish that Verant would address the issues raised by this e-mail somewheat in upcoming game patches. Fix the cleric quests so that normal human beings can do them. Make it so that those who farm and harvest things they neither want nor need cannot hold regular non-powergamer-players like myself over the barrel that is the relatively rare rewards in the game (in my view, the only things that justify the complete misery that many feel struggling through the mid-range/higher levels.) Look at the message that is being sent to dedicated players by the hell that is &quot;the hell levels&quot; and ask if it really is worth affirmatively turning people off to the game?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the whine. Any and all thoughts appreciated (even yes, the trademark &quot;Good!<br />
Quit! Less Lag for Me&quot;)<br />

<br />
You've made some excellent points in your post and I think they really need to see them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ming</div><div class="date">11-16-1999, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I think your post is indeed whiny, I can agree with you on the cleric quests being a tad ridiculous. The armor is not that great, and the quests boring and ill conceived. The quests are actually pretty cool in terms of story, but the fact that they involve camping rare spawns is complete BS, especially when the mobs drop items useful to our buddies, the druids. <br />
<br />
On Verant's side of the coin, I don't mind them implementing quests that require infinite patience and devotion, for run of the mill armor. Nobody is putting a gun to anyone's head here and forcing them to complete these quests. It's almost as if in wearing the items we label ourselves as extreme masochists.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you this. If they made EQ easier, do you feel you'd be having more fun? There would still be the &quot;powergamers&quot; and they'd still be sporting all the best items first, &quot;raping the economy,&quot; etc. It's always going to be a rat race in any online game, and as long as one fixates on that aspect of the game, one will either be pushed to make the time to get ahead, or become frustrated if they can't. IMHO this is the nature of the online RPG, and no amount of tweaking or development will ever level the playing field. People don't want to be equal. People want challenge, conflict, and competition. Sorry.<br />
<br />
I know this sounds onesided, but the so called &quot;roleplayers&quot; who claim to only be in the game to hug trees and chat in character are IMHO some of the greediest, whiniest, and most outspoken powergamers I've seen. I gotta get back to work or I'd go on and on. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">11-16-1999, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know where you are coming from. I may not have all the answers but i can offer some hope.<br />
<br />
I was hating trying to get stuff in this game for quite some time and you are JUST UNDER the level where the whole world opens up to you.<br />
<br />
When you get into your low 30s you will be offered spots in groups in almost any zone. I went into lower guk for the first time (i am level 32) this last weekend and was bombarded with /tells asking if i wanted to join a group. this was as soon as i zoned. unfortunately i was also bombarded with &quot;will you rez me&quot; tells as well.<br />
<br />
If you get requests for a rez, only do it if they (or their partner) will drag the body to you. I tell them that i cannot leave my group and I will rez if the body is brought to me and the usage of mana will not endanger my group. Most of the time people will understand and either bring the body or leave you alone.<br />
<br />
the player driven economy really does suck in my opinion. I cannot buy a Bloodstained Tunic at all. I got lucky and got gatorscale legs. This is something that I plan to change myself and something that you may be able to do yourself. If nobody will sell the items then i will sell them. for cheap. Sell gatorscale for 200plat instead of 800. get them in the market and make some people (like yourself and like i was) happy to get a really good item with the HARD EARNED AND SAVED cash. After all, anything you sell it for is a profit because you never paid for it if you get it yourself.<br />
<br />
When you are in your low 30s you can get these items and get into good groups that are also hunting it. This is what i have done. It is worth it. whether you can play 1 hour after the kids go to bed or 8 hours, it is all about having fun. And don't worry about level 30 being hell level. if you want to get out of it, do this...<br />
<br />
find a good group that is killing blues in a camp or location somewhere. as long as you kill alot of them, the XP adds up. I did this and made it out of 30 in a couple days. and the most important thing... DON'T look at the XP bar. you will only make yourself miserable. Think of level 30 as the perfect level to get your specialize up to a nice level.<br />
<br />
No matter what, don't give up. when i got to the 30s the game became fun for me again after the trials of the teens and low 20s. In 3-4 more levels you will high enough to go into almost any dungeon or zone in the game and will own most of them. for example, at level 33 almost nothing is aggressive to you in upper guk. go in with 3-4 more people and anything that is aggressive is quickly killed. and what is in upper guk? Gatorscale Arms and Legs.<br />
<br />
I hope that this has helped you a bit and possibly give you a little drive to move forward with some hope. It DEFINITLY gets better from where you are. tip of the iceberg.<br />

<br />
Let those who wish to powergame do so.  Let those who wish to item camp do so.<br />
<br />
Fantastic items are a bonus, not a requirement for the game.  I believe in my heart you can get to level 50 with NO special items, just items you can buy from merchants and players (I mean player-made, not gotten off MOBs).<br />
<br />
Being successful in the game, I believe, is far more a function of your skill and intelligence, rather than the stats of your character.<br />
<br />
In addition, you are here to have FUN.  If you don't find camping fun, then don't do it.  Seek out those of like minds.<br />
<br />
I too tried to get jboots and failed.  You will not find me camping for anything ever again.  You will find me having a blast in a dungeon, or travelling through the world, or roleplaying, or any number of things which *I* deem to be fun. 8)<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just saying, enjoy yourself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Enki</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I can get to level 50 without special armour or what have you, but is this really the point ?<br />
<br />
Level 50 is not the point of the game, there is no END to EQ, so they should be making people happier while they play, regardless of level.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I could sit around camping mob A from lvl 30-35 mob b from lvl 35-40 etc... all the way up to 50, but what have I accomplished ? I've killed lots of things, whoop de doo, but I have nothing to show for it besides that little 50 besides my name.<br />
<br />
I WANT to go and Quest for stuff, but questing in EverQUEST is a joke, it's all sit here, get this 18 hour spawn, sit here get this 26 hour spawn and then give the stuff to someone else who gives you something you could have REALLY used 20 levels ago.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with the first poster, I too am level 29, and I really just can't be arsed, I haven't played in a couple of weeks and will most likely cancel my account shortly, because, much as I loved EQ when I first started playing, the lustre has gone now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Emerld</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You missed my point.<br />
<br />
My point was to find what it is that is enjoyable to you in the game and ignore that which is not.  If that's leveling, fine, if that's camping, great, if that's questing, fabulous.<br />
<br />
And if you cannot find any joy in the game, then leave.<br />
<br />
If you're bored of the same old camping and leveling, have you considered trying Rallos Zek?<br />
