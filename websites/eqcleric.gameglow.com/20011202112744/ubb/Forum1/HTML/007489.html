</FONT><HR>I recently posted a message on a druid message board concerning back-up healers who heal at inopportune times and cause mana loss for a cleric.  I have had this problem to the extreme at times and thought I would send a helpful word out but instead the majority of the responses were in the negative.  Please take a look and give me your opinion on this  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>---------------------------------------- <A HREF="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral" TARGET=_blank>http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral</A> <P>Look for topic:  Grouping with clerics</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>This does upset me sometimes when it is a very big waste but when its not I try not to get too upset. Sometimes I have grouped with Druids or whoever who would heal my mates constantly wasting every spell I wanted to cast. When I went to cast Complete Heal they would heal the target back up before I could complete. When I cast Celestial Heal they would heal the target to full wasting my spell. Now that makes me mad. But in other situations I have had Druids or whoever who would heal *me*, because I usually dont do that when the battle is really heavy, and in one situation when the Enchanter was very close to dying the Shaman healed him, I healed him, and the Paladin LoH'd him. Sure it was a big waste but the Enchanter lived so thats all that matters. <P>So, in my opinion... back up healing is just that, you heal when the Cleric is either OOM or when someone is almost dead. Back ups please try to heal people only when you think its needed or else the Cleric may get pissy. And a pissy Cleric is usually the one who casts spells 5 seconds too late, speaking from personal experiance (whoops, sorry mr druid maybe you should have healed yourself!).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I love good backup healers.<P>First, the two healers should communicate about how they are going to handle the healing. Commuincation is key.<P>Second, all healers must announce their heals. My heal goes like this:<P>/g Superior Healing ---> %T<BR>/cast 1<P>Everyone knows that I'm healing this person. It is good when there are two healers, but also good when you are the only healer... the main tank knows that he shouldn't run off yet  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>When in a bad situation... its free for all on heals.

</FONT><HR>My primary is a druid, but play a cleric alt, and come here to learn.<P>I agree on communication; when I'm first grouped with a cleric, I usually send a tell and ask at what point my panic heal won't drive them nuts.  I get answers from 1 to 2 bulbs.  That way I can toss my fastish greater or superior heal in and maybe give breathing space if there's lag or a fizzle.<P>The exceptions: clerics, if my group's cleric is getting hit, I toss a heal FAST.  I want my clerics alive since they're way more important in a group than I am.  I'll also toss int casters a heal if they get hit, especially if the mob is still on them, so they don't go down too fast if I can help it.<P>I found it a bit hard to learn to group effectively with clerics, since I'd solod or been the primary healer so often; I know my healing is inefficient, and would never let a tank my level get below half, because my best heal usually doesn't heal more than a bubble on a tank my own level.  So being patient while a much more efficient cleric waits for his spells to be necessary was hard at first.<P>One hard part about playing a druid as I get higher level (only 51 now) is really coming face to face with the reality that I'm not the best at anything.  My attitude has become, ok, I'm not the best, but I can fill in and help my group flexibly.  To be honest, though, for folks who are used to soloing effectively, it can be hard to accept that.  It seems like grouping well as a druid demands that one use almost the opposite strategies from soloing.  I can't remember the last time I felt the need to dot in a group, for example.<P>I love reading this board, by the way; you folks have made me a much better druid because I've learned a little about how cleric spells work and can adapt to working with a cleric more easily.<P>/salute, <P>Hende  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think the problem of back-up healers stepping on clerical toes is worse at the lower levels then upper.  Having also played a druid and cleric (44/60 respectively) I guess i have a bit of a perspective on both sides.<P>I think the key here is no two people are the same, some back up's will heal till blue in the face.. some have to see you dead before they drop a heal.  I think /tells work best if your having a problem and Macro'ed heals... or even a macro that says, "%t is getting a Superior Heal in 10 seconds" just so your back up knows your not watching TV instead of health.<P>I also think this is primarily a lower level problem.  In the mid-30's you come across all kinds of horrible players (nothing personal the all the good lower level players).  You have p-leveled people, or twinks who have no clue... you have people who are still rather green and think their class can do things they can't (think cleric's who spec Evocation)... not to say these people don't plague the high level game, but it's worse when your younger.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I've seen these posts before...  The best way to deal with it is change your own mindset:  It's THEIR mana that got wasted (even if their heal landed first.)  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>If that doesn't work for you, work it out in tells.  Politely explain what your spells can do and what you're waiting to cast.

</FONT><HR>Thank you for the fine posts.  I do use the macros to announce inc heals when I'm grouping with another healer, even sometimes when I'm not so people don't get nervous and think I'm asleep at the wheel.<P>I was surprised at the response on the druid board.  I wasn't trying to flame the class (like I said, I play a 30 druid and 31 cleric) but it was somewhat received that way.  Not every point of mana has to be conserved, that's ture.  But the popular response was "it's their mana, not yours" and "EQ gave shams and druids heals too and they should use them whenever someone gets 2 bulbs knocked off".  My whole outlook is if we repeatedly waste mana by overhealing (enchanter being the exception), what happens when that add gets factored in and suddenly someone is dead because the healers are oom?  When lives are at stake (or more accurately, when someone's time they spent gaining that experience is wasted) isn't it important to use mana wisely?  How many posts have we all seen about clerics nuking when their nukes are not mana efficient?  I'm not saying druids/shams shouldn't heal, I am saying that they should yield heals to clerics as a general practice and reserve their heals for those panic moments when the cleric is yelling LOM please take over or when someone is sinking to close to 1 bulb of life (tank) or half life and being beat on (caster).  <P>I remember one time I was at the fort in Ill Omen and someone was saying ooc that their group was in despirate need of a healer.  My current group was falling apart (people leaving) and hadn't been very good so I figured I'd go help this other group.  When I got there, I noticed immediately that a druid was in a group.  I sent a tell to the group leader asking out of curiosity why they were searching so badly for a cleric?  His response went something like this, "it's true, we have a druid, but I'd rather have the druid casting snares, damage shields, and nukes to make a more effective group".<P>That made a lot of sense to me.  Not saying clerics are the end all be all number one and the back-ups should kiss their feet.  I'm just saying if you're more of an asset to the group throwing that nuke to end the fight sooner and I'm better at throwing the heals, lets operate that way and back each other up and do what we do best   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I believe shamans and druids can be excellent healers when their isn't a cleric present to take over the role.  I should know, my druid has been main healer MANY a time.  Right now since I'm in that lull between 29-34 it really isn't as big an ussue but once I get superior heal, I'm affraid it will be again.<p>[This message has been edited by Gabrianna (edited 11-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The only heals I announce are CH (long cast time), Donal (same), and in a few raids, Divine light.<P>Frankly, I don't have problems with back-up healers, not even other clerics. A tell or two at the biggining with the other cleric, and you establish the ground rules fast. As for the druids and shamans, they all seem to watch the enchanter and heal them more than anyone else, and only heal that tank if CH looks to be very close. Since I'm a firm believer in "Any mana spent on the enchanter whith aggo is NOT a waste", I don't have a problem. And once a druid passes the "I have Superior heal now, I'll heal the tank!" mindset, they're easy to work with. Shamans are the ones who always seem relieved not to have to heal, they have enough to do already.<P><BR>Don't get me wrong. Druids and Shamans are GREAT healers. Even Paladins and Necros can handle the main healer job. But when you have a cleric AND one of the others... you let the cleric heal. (similar levels all around, as a level 39 cleric can NOT out-heal a 60 druid or a 60 shaman, due to sheer mana pool differences)<P>------------------<BR>The Drunkard of Domus Divanae<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I generally prefer if my back-up healer takes care of two people-me and the chanter. If I feel I'm cutting my CHeal too close, I generally duck out and throw a remedy or celes on them before I startmy CHeal up again. Then again, I LOVE to cut CHeals CLOSE-my personal record is having it land when the MA was at half purple health. I regularly land CHeals at 1/2 bubble. And no, I've never lost someone doing this. Seriously. Even being main healer on planar/large mobs (Kael/VS/Chardok royals/WW dragons are about as big as my guild goes ATM), I can figure out the HP drop pretty quickly on just about any tank-a fight or three and I know when to start my CHeal for maximum mana conservation. So, yeah, its a lil annoying when the backup suddenly heals the MA back to two bubbles two seconds before my CHeal lands. But, depending on how the mana is going, I'll either duck out or just let it land. After the second or third duck-out, they usually get the point =)<P>------------------<BR>Higar Mettlebender <BR>Vicar of the 51st Prayer and Luclin Loot Ho<BR>Guardians of the Keep<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20669" TARGET=_blank>Higar's Profile</A><BR>Master Drinker (200) <BR>Master Jeweler (188)Master Fletcher (185)Master Brewer (175) Master Smith (175) Master Potter (168) Master Baker (162) (Anyone got any dragon meat lying around??)

</FONT><HR>Asking back up healers not to heal just makes it less likely they'll save your ass when it's needed. You have to look at it from their perspective, you could be the worst cleric on the server as far as they know, and they don't want anyone to die anymore than you do. You have to give them time to get a feel for how you heal, and how low you let people get before you heal them. If they're still wasting mana after that, well, they're not very good, and not much point worrying about it.<P>Aiien</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think you are misunderstanding the feedback you got on the druids grove. It's all a matter of perspective and in your case, yes backup healers can overheal quite a bit at lower lvl's. They are still learning their class, you really can't expect much..some people are better at judging than others at that lvl. The responses you got are mostly from high lvl druids that are used to dealing with mobs that dish a lot of dmg fast and can kill a chanter or cleric in a heartbeat if they aren't paying attention.<P>The way I see it (lvl 60 druid), it's my job to watch the cleric's and chanters health. I will waste any amount of mana necessary to keep those 2 alive. It's the clerics job to heal the tanks. It's a complete waste of my mana to heal a tank unless a CH was mistimed or incase the clr is CHing one tank and the other is close to CH health and is still taking dmg. I.E. it's my mana and my responsibility to manage it well.<P>My advice, don't worry about it so much at your lvl. Relax and have fun. If it bugs you so much send a private tell to the druid saying, if the tank goes below so and so bubs of health please throw them a heal. This will most likely get them to back off a bit.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I would agree with Seriena.  Most of the posts on the Druid grove were not disagreeing with you.  They were from high level druids who have somewhat of a different perspective.  I have found that fighting things that are level 50 are much different than the things I fought at level 30.  They hit so much harder and faster it is not even funny.  You can lose someone in a blink of an eye.  If you get any adds or what not you can go down even faster.  I have had a few situations where I was grouped with a Druid who kept wanting to heal the main tank.  I sent her a tell and let her know when I was starting my heal process and if they got below a certain point then hit the panic button as others have said.  Truly I would not even worry about it unless your group is continually waiting on them to get mana.  If not, let them heal away.  It might be a little annoying but everybody lives......Just have fun.  That is the main thing.<P>Allono<BR>51st Vicar<P>Arano<BR>40 Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Of course the point is to have fun.  Maybe I've just grouped with a few bad druids (and clerics for that matter lol).  I remember I grouped with a cleric once and right away I sent her a tell asking how she wanted to work the heals.  My suggestion was let me take 3 (a tank, caster, and her) and her take 3 (the other tank, caster, and me).  That went over like a lead brick.  She wanted to take turns healing per battle (her heal one battle, me heal the next, and so on).  We ended up overhealing so much it was unreal because I thought it was my turn or she thought it was hers.  A big influence behind me listing this post came from one particular druid I grouped with.  As soon as the tank dropped to half life and I started casting g-heal, she would start casting healing and basicly cause healing overflow every single time (talk about frustrating).  I sent her a tell asking her if it was alright with her if I took over main heals and if someone got below 2 bulbs of life or I went LOM/OOM if she would then step in.  I pretty much got ignored and things continued on like this for about 30 minutes when she finally left. <P>Anyway, I realize a lot of people responding to this on the druid and this board are level 50 and my problems at level 30 may seem insignificant.  I'm beginning to think I'm the only person here below 40.  Any ways thanks for the advice, point taken.<p>[This message has been edited by Gabrianna (edited 11-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I hear what you are saying.  It can be very frustrating when you are getting ready to cast a big heal (which takes a lot of mana) and just before it lands your target is above the level where your heal would put them to just under full again.  Believe me.  It will get worse when you get superior heal.  That heal does a lot of healing on a 35th level tank.  About half life.  Sooo, a Druid may hit the panic button too early if they do not catch on to how much you are healing.  Sounds like you are talking to them which is the best you can do.  If they continue to do that then let them.  There are some people out there that will never get it.  As long as you live that is the main thing.  If they are sooo bad, you might even try getting the main tank on your side and sending a tell to the healer.  Might work.....  Anyways,  Have fun and take care<P>Allono<P>P.S.  Get yourself to 34 quick.  Your life will change fast.  You will get tells asking you to join a group when you aren't even looking for one.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I saw nothing but positive from the Druid's Grove.  <P>As a primary healer (55 cleric) and a back up healer (60 druid) there is no such thing as  a wasted heal.  I HATE what Verant has done to health bar updates.  I would MUCH rather toss a chloroblast and heal an enchanter who two seconds before was on the way out, than sit there and assume  the cleric has it all covered.  Because the clerical role is stressful and you know what? THE DRUID CAN HELP!!  I always receive /hugs, kudos and praise from the clerics I group with when playing my druid.<P>Btw, the cleric was my first character.  Played to 52 and decided to take a break and see the world from another perspective.  It was eye-opening.

</FONT><HR>First let me make clear that my main is a 57 cleric, but I have a 32 Shammy, and a 22 Druid <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I think a lot of the overlapping heal trouble comes from younger times (levels 20ish-30ish), when we all have the same heal spells.  Many groups at those levels prefer druids/shaman as main healers because they can SoW as well.  "Backup" healers get used to being "main" healers, and it can be very hard to make the switch to back-up.  I think communication in both group and tells is important.  Way back when (with my cleric), I had hotkeys for every heal I did. Now it is just for Complete heal.  I used to announce in group chat *my* ideal time for healing a tank (ie when he is at 1/2 life I would heal), and to please not panic until they are missing more than that.  Then I would send a tell to my backup healer to especially watch int casters healths, and to make hotkeys for heals.  I also sent a tell saying that if their "Healing so-and-so" message came up before mine I would interrupt, but if mine came up first, I expected them to interrupt.<P>I hope this is not to much ramble. I tend to do that..my brain goes a lot faster than my fingers do  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=14272" TARGET=_blank>Phalia Kordain</A><BR>56th Templar<BR>Lords of Belterra<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>"When I went to cast Complete Heal they would heal the target back up before I could complete"<P>You are casting complete healing.  A druid casts two chloroblasts on the warrior.  The CH lands, and warrior heals to full.<P>Who wasted mana?  Is the warrior at full hp?  Would he have been at full HP when the heal landed if the druid hadn't healed?  Sure, how about after? sure.  You are spending 400 mana.  Period.  What else happens makes no impact on this.  The only wasted mana belongs to teh druid. <P> Now ask yourself, have you *ever* landed a CH a second or 3 late?  ever?  If you have, and a druid chloroblasts once when a tank is under 1 bub or something, maybe he isn't wasting anyone's mana, even if your CH woulda landed.<p>[This message has been edited by Vage (edited 11-27-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I can definitely see Gabri's point.  My cleric is my first character and my main.  I have always striven to make my healing as efficient as possible, because a lot of times the pace of the group is determined by the cleric's mana more than other caster mana.  Nothing against pure meleers, but they tend to get ants in their pants during down time.  This is why I can see wasted mana bugging clerics.  And it is wasted, because the group is not waiting on the druid, they are waiting on the cleric.  If I cast a complete heal that I didn't need to, yes, everyone is still alive, but it increases group down time.<P>I have made a druid alt and a warrior alt, and am now seeing their points of view too.  As a druid, if I am finishing a fight with 70 mana and the cleric is 40m all the time, maybe I need to use more offensive spells so the fight ends quicker.  <P>Playing my warrior has also helped me to learn how to communicate in a group better as a cleric.  Especially at the lower levels, healers can be very enigmatic (me included). :P  "I need to med," and then nothing for a while.  My warrior has to guess when to pull, or keep asking mana levels, which as a cleric bugs me to no end, and puts the pressure on.  After a fight now I give the thumbs up or down, and keep my group updated on when to pull again.  <P>I guess I am lucky, because I have had no complaints with any secondary healer so far that I have grouped with.  I will always announce my heals, and also my mana levels.  When I say 10 or 15m, that's when the sec. healer will jump in to heal while I med for that one more complete heal that will enable us to end the fight.  <P>I agree with previous posts that communication is the key, but I think that maybe some extra /tells are the way to go when you have a secondary healer who perhaps just doesn't have a clue yet.  <P>Needry<BR>51 Vicar<BR>Luclin</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007489&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=007489&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
