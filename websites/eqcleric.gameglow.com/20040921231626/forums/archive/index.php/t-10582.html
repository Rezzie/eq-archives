A good party either camping one of the better spawns (not that you have to worry about ruby anymore  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif) or just taking the non-spawn areas can make a bouble a night and 100+ pp in fs and plat loot.<br />
<br />
Enouther advantige in this spot is that the non-spawn areas are rearly camped, so more offten than not there is no cometition for the lizards.<br />
<br />
Note: this was pre-ruby patch, no idea is it's still the same, but i would be surprised if it has changed that much.</div></div><hr />

not much cash here, but exp makes up for it.<br />
Gained 4 bubbles in about 5 hours yesterday and only reason I didnt level up was that I gained a level the day before as well :-)<br />
I recommend a Full group:<br />
Enchanter, cleric, some tough tanks. (2 clerics are always nice :-)<br />
<br />
So now I am half a bubble from 30th :-)<br />

In the last two nights (four hours) I made three bubbles of exp in a party that took the temple where the Tae spawns.  About the same exp gains as doing the Ghost in Unrest, but much safer.  Another plus is there aren't as many clerics in the zone, at least on Povar.  The players I grouped with (most of them bigger) said Cazic was a great spot for exp from L25-40.</div></div><hr />
