  My RL boyfriend and partner in game recently decided he was unhappy with his ranger, and so he started a shaman.  Great!  I love shaman.  <br />
  Well he is now 24th (I'm 26th) and we have started to collect parts of the quest armor pieces for Totemic.  We have at least 1/2 of every piece (minus the breastplate, helm and cloak).  And every piece we have gotten has been through NORMAL hunting.  That's right, we just happened to be hunting in the area and got pieces for his armor.  South Karana, Everfrost, Unrest...the list goes on.  <br />
  Maybe it is a tinge of jealousy, but don't get me wrong...I am ecstatic that we are capable of getting him such good armor right now and I'm glad that our armor has had the spawn rates increased (or so they say) but it's still camping not questing.  I can't say that I hunt in Befallen, Kerra Isle, or Aviak Isle in OOT.  And several of the mobs that drop our icons and ingots would mop the floor with me.  *cries*<br />
  Thanks for letting me whine and cry...<br />

You want something that other classes can have, but can't get it.  Shamans do seem to have some of the easier armor quests though.  I think that is because there are so few of them around.  Do a &quot;/who all count shaman&quot; and see how many are around.  You will find that there are a very high proportion of Clerics in the same way.  Granted, it would take 1 in 6 players to be a Cleric to meet the demand at high levels (so I seem to gather from what I have heard), where Shamans are nice, but not a necessity.<br />
<br />
The quest armor is supposed to have a 4 hour respawn time.  Once you find out a spawn time, you can be there and ready for the next spawn.  Don't take it from someone that is there waiting, that is the type of thing people will remember beyond their EQ days.</div></div><hr />
