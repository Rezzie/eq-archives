<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">04-07-2000, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm gearing up to get level 44 now and become a spec slaughtering machine. The guides on this site seem pretty good, but they only cover the Feerot specs.<br />
<br />
What about the Oasis specs? Any advice on pulling them one or two at a time? If I fear them, will they come back to me when they break fear? or is there a chance that they will run around slaughtering newbies? (I imagine that would make me rather unpopular).<br />
<br />
How about the OOT specs. Can they be soloed at all?<br />

<br />
Then Fear Dead spell is great since it's improvement.<br />
<br />
There is one flaw with Oasis though, and I might be doing it wrong, but more often than not, almost all four Spectres would come at me if i tried to only take one.<br />
<br />
So, without SOW, it got dangerous.. I'd have to fear them all away and gate to safety.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to solo that Spectre camp... Pacify is to unstable for it. Maybe someone knows if there is a better tactic to that place.<br />

I know at 47 you can pull singles always, even the bunch in the tower, so it might be worth it to grab a 47 ranger or caster to partner up with to pull.  I pull singles for friends all the time, usually banish once then root them on shore for them.  At 47 you can just move to the island, and nothing will assist as you move around.<br />
