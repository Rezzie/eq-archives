I was kinda worried it would resist my spells more, but I hit it 5 times for full 261 points of damage each time.  If you have some necromancer friends or can make some, I'd recommend spectre hunting.</div></div><hr />

I did it with a druid. He used levatite to pull and snare it. After I feared the spectre, it just run slowly. We burn it down without any run and hurt. Very safe killing  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
I got good exp by killing them. And I got 2 black pearl. My druid friend got his box  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I take this to mean that the Box of Abu Kar is still dropping off of spectres? I've killed like 50 now and have yet to see one black pearl or a box (which was rumored to be taken out of the drop table).<br />

Since all those lizards and gorillas have to fit in somewhere over there, I suspect it is quite crowded. Anybody been there lately?<br />
<br />
Can you tell that I miss the good old days of Cazic Thule as a 30-something dungeon!<br />
