These camps were for the ghoul magi and the frenzied ghoul.<br />
<br />
A word of advice for anyone who expects to get exp off of such a camp. The high levels won't pull! They are only there for the item, not exp. Either everything is green to them or they are of a high enough level that they don't need the exp. Also, they want to be at full strength in case the named one appears.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">03-02-2000, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know what you mean.  I was camping Rathe Mountains by myself pulling skeles at 25.  A shout goes out that a mid thirties group is looking for a cleric to heal them while they fight the hill giants.  I go over to find a 39 cleric there (um, why on earth do you need me??) along with bard, enchanter, etc. I am told that I get to heal until the mana runs out and that cleric there is camping for something or other for a quest.  Okie dokie I think, I can handle this.  With a 33 bard and a 32 enchanter my mana never drains so I'm thinking oh good I'll go ahead and buff with symbols and whatnot.  I finish buffing EVERYONE, including the cleric, minus myself though, when someone pulls 2 hill giants.  I think okay, med med med and get ready to have the other cleric heal.  Oh no, I'm stupid, he gated across the zone the moment I started healing the party, then zoned and came back to de-aggro.  He finally gets back to meet my corpse (bye bye lvl 26 that I was) along with 2 others, and I ask for a rez.  OHHHHHHH no he can't be bothered by that, he's camping a spawn.  <br />
<br />
Am I the only one that likes to buff and heal and practice the often overlooked class of spells while waiting on an 8 hour spawn?   Much less a party member that died and lost a lvl? I left that group (second time I tried a hg group at 26, I won't be going back til I'm well into 29 so I can rez my party) and went back to aviaks out in Lake Rathe.  <br />
<br />
There, I was greeted with the &quot;can you heal/buff me and break this spawn for me&quot; tells that I usually get there (I really must go hunt elsewhere.)  I take the single spawn at stone skeles and occassionally help that group break a nasty spawn, in which I die.  Not only do I find out that one of the other players there has a 41 cleric but he logs on, runs over from Paw, and rezzes me, but also gives me another pair of splitpaw gloves for being so kind.<br />
<br />
Where are all these good clerics when you need them???  I know that at 29 I am going to  get tell after tell requesting a res here and there, and will I mind? Not really, just pay the cost of tp and sow, plus a small donation if you like.<br />
<br />
I will never forget the lvl 29 cleric that gave me a rez when I, at lvl 12, was exploring and accidently got mobbed in guk.  Good clerics make the best of friends =)<br />

<br />
I'm 45th now, and I've been grouping with basically the same people since 24th.  And that &quot;sorry can't rez you even tho you died because I was an idiot&quot; crap DOES NOT fly.<br />
<br />
I am more than happy to rez anyone who needs it.  If I have to travel, I want sow.  That's about all I need.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Don't know what server you're on, but if it's Bertox, gimme a jingle.</div></div><hr />
