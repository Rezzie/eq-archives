Show the list  to everyone here and Mail bomb the with the subject matter of &quot;Clerics need to be changed&quot;  and tell them in the body just to come to EQ xclerics board and read our problems. I am sure if all the clerics form here bombed the email with at least 10 messages each that would get thier attention.<br />
<br />
Im sorry for the negativity Im just getting sick and tired of other enhancements to other classes and/or thier armor.<br />
<br />
I mean shesh a clerics armor is damn nightmare to get, Not to mention boring, let alone stat enhancements.<br />
<br />
I recently helped a buddy with his bard quest... all we had to do was kill a stinking a grifeene for some charm...I was thinking my god if it were only this easy. At least his spawns pop regulary. I dont think I have to remind people about our spawns hehehehe anyhows enough of my thoughts...<br />
<br />
BTW I have been playing my wizard lately since being a cleric is an obvious second class citizen in Verants eyes...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huorg</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should be really careful here.<br />
<br />
All things considered the Cleric is quite a blessed class in Norrath.<br />
<br />
We have a much easier time of it than most classes in terms of soloing and also in terms of finding groups.<br />
<br />
I'm not particularly interested in having Verant conduct a high level review of class balance because I do NOT think that we would benefit from this.<br />
<br />
I've played several melee classes out into the 20's and the Cleric is far superior to them in terms of overall power and independence.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed<br />
<br />
Lets not rock the boat.  If you don't like the cleric armor quests, don't do them.  No sense drawing unneeded attention to our class and having them &quot;equalize&quot; our class over some armor that isn't all that great anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rafeco</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regardless of what Verant might or might not do to our class for mail bombing them with requests about our armor, this is an incredibly bad idea.<br />
<br />
For one thing, it's totally immature.  People have made rational, intelligent arguments asking for changes, or at least an explanation of why those changes haven't been made.  If those don't work, then it's not worth trying any more.<br />
<br />
If you feel strongly about the problems with cleric armor or anything else in the game, then the best protest is to stop giving your money to Verant.  If enough people stop giving them their money, then they'll change or go out of business.  This is the way the world works.  When you deal with companies, you vote with your dollars.  If you keep giving them your money despite the fact that you're dissatisfied with their products, then they don't really have much incentive to change.<br />
<br />
In any case, harrassing them is probably the most wrongheaded idea I've read on this board yet.<br />

I think the Sit-in was as extreme a measure as is reasonable to take - if that event and the petitions and postings haven't effected a change, then there is probably little more to be accomplished.  <br />
<br />
As was pointed out, we do not want the attention of the Tuning Team, which I feel has rapidly taken on the characteristics of the Church during the Spanish Inquisition.  Be afraid, be very afraid.<br />

Yes our armor sucks and we arnt' getting any impovements.  But (well before everyone was high level) the highest players in the game consisted of clerics paladins and necros.  Clerics are extremely powerful, we have the gods on our side :-)<br />

I've seen several *very* well written e-mails to Smed on this board.  I'll be writing one in the next few days.<br />

Mail bombing is such an ugly thing, and if you do it, don't be surprised if you don't have an ISP.<br />

More than likely, you'll crash EQ and then we won't be able to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only place to go beyond a sit in is to simply cancel your account. <br />
<br />
I don't think armor is worth canceling any accounts over though, so frankly Verant wins this round. We are stuck with the crappy quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bas</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to ask, why would we draw the attention of the nerfing team?  I mean, I do not see clerics as overpowerful...what am I missing? <br />
<br />
We are meant to heal, we do it well.<br />
We are meant to fight undead, we do it well.<br />
We are meant to buff, we do it well ( but so do druids and shamans, even more so beyond our HP/AC buffs ).<br />
<br />
Where are we overpowerful in any way?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huorg</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there are two primary areas where our abilities intersect to create a whole that is more powerful than the parts:<br />
<br />
1) Our ability to wear really good armor and also to root and nuke takes away most of the risk involved in this maneuver.  I routinely attempt to kill things that are white or yellow to me using this type of tactic.  If I fail I usually manage to get away anyway.  The bronze armor means that carrion ghouls and drybones can't really do that much damage to me quickly and I can almost always get a gate to stick or use DA to make it to zone.<br />
<br />
2)  Our ability to buff vs magic and the elements means that npc casters are soloable, even named ones.  My L19 Warrior died in under a minute trying to solo Ghanex Drah.  My L19 Cleric had more than half health left after he killed Drah.  The resists were the major factor here.  (Well, along with the DD that killed Drah in about 60 seconds...)<br />
<br />
I could name a half dozen other ways that we absolutely rock a melee type or Wizard into the ground but they'd all reference in some way one of the advantages (AC, DD, buffs, etc.) listed above.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to for me is that Clerics are every bit as powerful as the pet classes but we don't have to rely on the pet for this power.  This makes me nervous when I start to think of the potential nerfs that could come our way...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaxus</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense, but playing a cleric up to a ripe young age of level 19, hardly gives you any idea about the positives or the negatives of the cleric class.  In fact, level 19 is not even a quarter of the exp it takes to get even close to 50th level.  You havent even reached any of the four &quot;hell&quot; levels. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, to compare a cleric to a fighter as far as solo ability against a caster, really isnt a good comparison.  It takes much for intelligence and good tactics for a fighter to take out a caster.  He must use bashes/kicks or what-have-you at the precise timing to interrupt spells, and perhaps faster weapons.  Clerics, as you yourself stated, can get away with the root and shoot method, accompanied with a heal here and there.  If you really want to compare our class, do it against another healing class.  They are our counterparts anyway.  Our true balance(?) lies in our equality with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micromu</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is one of the worst ideas. We don't want them to hate us, do we? <br />
<br />
I really think our day is coming, we'll be rewarded one day and I don't think that day is far off.<br />
<br />
BTW, at level 19, you are 38% of the way to level 50.<br />

<br />
I see nothing in the coming spell levels to suggest that any of our abilities are going to vanish into the night the way that melees abilities do as they level into oblivion for solo purposes.<br />
<br />
And I have played a Shaman to L37 so I do have some idea of the steep rise in mob abilities after L30.<br />
<br />
My point was that by ANY reasonable measure of ability a cleric outclasses ALL melee classes significantly as early as L14 and certainly by L19 when the melee classes are reduced to beaiting on the odd blue goblin or orc...</div></div><hr />

No reason to take such rash actions. A calm, rational, and logical approach is best. Engaging them in a dialogue may be productive. The kitty tactic of mail bombing is well, just immature. And to reiterate a point, if you don't like the present situation or the product, then boycott the product and cancel your account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have had our (peaceful) Sit In, Verant may have ignored us publicly, but they do know it happened.<br />
<br />
We will now either get changes or we won't, if we don't, in my opinion, we never will.  <br />
<br />
Any Extreme actions will only result in you joining that list of players who have been banned from the game, and it will turn peoples opinion from one of sympathy to one of disgust, even anger.<br />
<br />
Face it, the armour is not worth the fuss, yes it's a bitter pill, yes it shows us that Verant doesn't have any pride in what they produce anymore, but at the end of the day, it doesn't stop us from playing the game and having fun.<br />

Look the night of our sit-in, Veriant had problems with 2 servers.  The Nameless went MIA for how many days?  Then there was problems with a couple of zones on the server we were on.  Cut Veriant some slack, I would much rather have them working on a DOWN SERVER, then making a showing at our sit-in.<br />

<br />
I don't think that the sit in was very successful...and if you look at the monk's sit in...They still nerfed feign death..and they did the sit in BEFORE the changes were to be implemented.<br />
<br />
Ok, so the armor quests are stupid, and time consuming (time consuming = you pay more money), and the the end stats on the pieces are definitely not worth it.  Even without PoH PoF gear, there are some OTHER items I would rather be wearing.<br />
<br />
The ONLY way Verant will actually change anything is if they have some competition.  <br />
<br />
When other companies start putting products out, and their client base starts shifting to other on-line games they'll notice.<br />
<br />
I like Everquest, they did a great job!  I'm a thorough EQ addict.  My ONE complaint is that they don't seem to listen to their customers.  I'm not talking about some raging 12 year old complaining why his KSing Wiz can't have Ice Comet at level 4.  I mean well thought out, general consensus, cross class opinions.  It seems they have a BLANKET ignore policy.<br />
<br />
If any online game comes out that has great customer service, and a good product.  That's what I would jump for.<br />

<br />
I don't mind the cleric quest armour but I would have appreciated more +Wis items in the armour.  This is not going to stop me from trying to get a full set.<br />
<br />
I just like the idea of a full set of Golden armour.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean that I don't like the amount of time we have to wait for the ingots to spawn.  I have used the /feedback in game to show my dissatisfaction at the camping I have to endure to get the items.<br />
<br />
I was lucky with the Necro on Necro Island at Kerra, the second time I went to look.<br />
<br />
Anyway, enough of my ramble.  Good luck to those who want to do the quests.  I hope you have the patience</div></div><hr />
