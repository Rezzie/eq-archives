<br />
We have had upto 11 sofar - and havent been close to killing him. <br />
<br />
I know number of clerics isnt the only important factor - so no need to tell me that   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Strategy, group composition etc, etc all matters alot too.<br />

First kill had a record showing of 15 clr. Or well, 12 clr and 3 clr twinks. Always had more than 10 when we've killed it though, but I think 15 was peak... of course it's not just clr, but clr+shm+mag really (or atleast we use torpor to heal the modrodding damage).<br />
<br />
I'd say 8 clr 4 shm 3 mage would be plenty for example, but since we have 0 active mages and 1 active shaman, the cleric number has to be pretty high :&lt;<br />

I would say min of needed clerics are somewhere between 9 and 11 depending how many mages and 2nd healers you have.<br />

<br />
I'd still like to see the 17 (soon to be 18) that we have key'd show up though =)<br />
<br />
Having a good number of shamans and druids around really helps though, there are a lot of different priestly duties to go around.<br />

<br />
Lowest number on an attempt was 8, highest was 15. With 15 you have a fair number of people standing around doing nothing...<br />

<br />
Second Emp kill was our lowest cleric turnout, 10 I think, and lemme tell you, we were right on the edge for the entire fight... Runnin out of mana, runnin out of rods, the whole nine yards. We had low DPS that night too... the fight took 58 minutes lol =)  Our other kills were ~25 mins in length.<br />
