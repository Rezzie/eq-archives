I was there with a lvl 22 shamen, 20 druid, and me, 19 cleric. We were taking both spawns with no troubles as well as mopping up any minos or muddites that wondered by. Exp was just flying. I was averaging a bubble every 45 minutes when we had both sides. Loot is also great. The eyes have words, gems, and eye parts. They can drop up to 2 or 3 plat at a time, and that is not rare. They also have a rare drop of the polished bone bracelet, 2 AC and plus 3 WIS and INT. The wondering minos can have mino axes and gems. Over all a great place for loot and exp. I plan on maybe making 24 here<br />

I have found the Beholder Maze to be full of sorrow and lost experience.  The eye's dont really con properly, considering the power the charm spell has (they really need to con at least 5 levels higher, with nothing else changed).  The mino's and mudd's were cool, but the eyes were just a pain in the ass.  The Maze is best for those nukers out there.  You need to kill the eye's (especially the named ones) FAST, and tanks are worthless to do this (since they attack, get charmed, and shred those robe-wearing casters in no time). I avoid the area, but again, this is just my humble opinion.</div></div><hr />

I have fought there for 1 1/2 levels. On my sever it usually is not very crowded and even if you have to split spawns it is good loot and EXP.  As the cleric in your party you need to make sure the eye does not get off that Charm spell.  So In the group I would start the attack with Holy might, Smite, Stun and usually by that time the neker and any other caster and/or fight has it down.  Keeps that charm from going off and the result is an easy kill.  Beware though because at Lvl 21 Lord Syrkl Has resisted my stuns about 20% of the time. But in that case make sure all the members of the party have Endure magic to get those quick Kills.<br />
