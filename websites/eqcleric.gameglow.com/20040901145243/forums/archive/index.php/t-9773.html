I hate to acuse people of stealing loot...but COME ON PEOPLE we KNOW what your doing!!!</div></div><hr />

It sucks!  I was in assassin/supplier room in lower guk and I was the group leader, so I looted special kills then we randomed.  Well, supplier spawns and we kill him and ... NOTHING.  No light burlap sack, no thick banded belt, just 8 silver and some odd copper.  I was so shocked!  Thank Tunare my group knew me and knew I wouldn't steal else I would have made some enemies that night.   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
I absolutely refuse to loot anything special first time anymore because I'm scared that it will happen again.<br />

<br />
Full group...pulling from the house...we pulled the Bartender.  He comes out weilding a rapier...and we take him down.  The person that is up on loot (4pp), loots the Bartender...<br />
<br />
While this is happening.  The RGM gets trained into us.  With some good teamwork we take out the RGM and his cronies.  Bam...OK..so I am next on loot and I loot the RGM and was going to give teh Savants Cap to a member of the party (I already had one, and he needed)..<br />
<br />
The druid pipes up....its still my loot..<br />
<br />
Umm...You looted bartender...and you were at 2 plat when you started looting.<br />
<br />
He didn't have anything..<br />
<br />
No belt?  No Opalline Ear ring?<br />
<br />
Nope....Well what about the rapier?  He had a FS rapier....Oh it was rusty...<br />
<br />
I did a quick scope of the corpse cause the key was still on it.  Hmm...you took the time to loot the Bartender, find nothing...take the Rapier...destroy it (not drop on ground), but left the key...<br />
<br />
I gave him the Cap then booted him from the party on consensus from the others...<br />
<br />
They are out there....<br />

<br />
We had been in the Tower in Unrest for about 5 hours trying for bloodstained and one of the group left.<br />
<br />
We got a Troll Warrior called Pigg as a replacement.<br />
<br />
Anyhow we had a huge fight and the knight drops and during the fight Pigg loots out of turn.<br />
<br />
We ask pigg if it was a mantle or a tunic (until this time, the group had always left the mantle on the body so there could be no argument about cheating), however Pigg says it had nothing !!.<br />
<br />
All hell broke out, Pigg left the group and did a run for the zone and we ended up doing an OOC and everyone in Unrest (about 60 people at the time) and my guild (about 50 at the time) agreed that the Knight always drops something and that Pigg had to be a KSer.<br />
<br />
Too bad if he was in fact innocent, but if so, he had to be the most unlucky troll on the planet.<br />
<br />
1st to accidentally loot out of turn.<br />
2nd to accidentally loot the mob we were camping.<br />
3rd to get an incredibly rare Knight spawn that didn’t have a Mantle or Tunic.<br />

<br />
Not to say that any of these people were telling the truth (and the fact that most of them make a run for the boarder as if Taco Bell was on the other side tells me that they wern't) but rare spawns sometimes do NOT have something. Untill you are actually the one that loots and finds nothing on the corpse you probally won't believe it.<br />
<br />
Personally I once looted the Cav in LGuk and was totally shocked to see nothing on the corpse. My group had one hell of a time believing it, but since half of them were longtime friends in game and the others were longtime friends of those friends they eventually accepted the fact. <br />
<br />
Its when someone says &quot;whoops ummm my house is on fire *ya thats it*&quot; and gate/zones that I really get pissed. Anyway I'm rambling. My point is if a friend tells you that there was nothing on a corpse then he may be telling the truth. Of course strangers that run like hell after a rare kill are probally ninjas in disguise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arazmas</div><div class="date">01-09-2000, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm... I think I have looted ONCE out of all the special mobs that has NONE of the special loots in it... If that's true it has to be a very rare case.  However I suggest you write down that guy's name and inform others grouping with him that this has happened. <br />
<br />
That reminds me that I have once looted the unrest spirit with BOTH jagged band and DWB.. *chuckle*  Weird huh? =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luminar</div><div class="date">01-09-2000, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it happens... both ways. <br />
<br />
ive looted atleast 5 mobs that didnt drop anything, one being ex. How ever I have observed others caught in stealing. Some guildmates where on frenzied and when it droped a non guild looted it and said it had fbss. next thing you know &quot;its dissapeared&quot;. i wasnt in the group so I decided to keep some tabs on him. a day or 2 later I see him in freeport auctioning a fbss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">01-10-2000, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both the jagged band AND the boots? I was in there for 13, almost 14 hours yesterday, and never got BOTH off one. Managed to get lucky and get two boots, and we were doing a bit of a different loot style. We were doing alpha on the jb's since they kept popping up. Seemed to work somewhat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">arazmas</div><div class="date">01-10-2000, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea both... well that's probably some kinda bug or super rare occation.  I've played about 8 levels on my paladin, and *think* 10 - 12 levels in unrest on my cleric now... that thing happened ONCE. I've looted a total of ... I think 7 DWBs in my life that that BOTH loots thing happened only once and the only once I've heard it's happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infestalia</div><div class="date">01-11-2000, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This mob dropping nothing thing DOES happen and seems to happen more and more ((.  At first I was sceptical.....but I have looted and found nothing and have had people check loots that I completely trust.  But the fact that it can drop nothing just makes it easier for those that do scam ((<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arss Rubybone</div><div class="date">01-22-2000, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 possible solutions for this but the the No Drop items idea screws it up the first one.<br />
<br />
Idea 1:<br />
<br />
When a person loots in a group the item should automatically be randomed within the group members no questions asked (I mean with verant software).  Then if the person who gets the item wants to trade, sell its up to them.<br />
<br />
Idea 2: When items are looted (or maybe just rare items) the name of whoever loots it and the item should appear on the screen to let everyone know who has it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaydim Aashmodai</div><div class="date">01-22-2000, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it happened to me. I was in mistmoore and in your lower 20's gargoyles mean great PP if you get the eyes. The way we do it is that theres no arder for looting the ordinary initiates, but for gargoyles we go alpha. Well, I had just joined this group and the first thing we killed was a gargoyle. I was looking around using the mouse when I scroll across the corpse and it looted. Well, it almost came to blows from someone in my own guild! We still have strained relations now because. The stupid gargoyle didnt have anything on it anyways...but of course no one belived me.<br />

With all those people there I suppose a lot of them could have ninja-looted and not fessed up, but I suppose it happens. Once a group I was in got the assasin on a pull from lower in the keep.. I was the only one without a mask and since he wasnt piercing I thought I might finally get it. Well the battle ends, I am told to loot up only to discover the assassin's corpse has vanished. I had seen another group member looting *something* in the middle of all the combat, but no one dmitted to looting the assassin. All I know is that my opinion of that person has gone downhill.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Whether that will be group only, or similar to an emote, they didn't say.  Can see that being really irritating in a newbie zone  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  But should stop any scams!!!<br />

(I'm one of these people that if I don't need it, and it don't work for me, I don't want it) and we did get boots 2 times that night throughout the group, and several rings, but the second corpse I checked had only the weapon shield and globe. None of the special items he normally drops</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remelio</div><div class="date">02-02-2000, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One night in Cazic Thule, I was swinging by the throne room giving my friend Sonette's group clarity.  I was meditating it off (I also buffed them with augmentation) when they pulled the upper throne room.  BIG mistake, as the throne room spawned at the same time.  I color flux and shifted about 8-10 mobs, until I finally (and quickly.. oops I wasn't grouped, IE nobody could see my life bar) fell.  Anyway the group survived, and there were two named.  After the golem fell, Sonette heard a barbarian say 'ravenscale coif'.  The Tae Ew Diviner dropped the mantle.  Sonette won the random on the mantle and the group decided to give me the coif for bravely sacrificing my life so that they could live.  Anyway I get there and the barbarian all of a sudden 'doesn't have it'.  'I was asking' he said.  Sonette gives me a tell saying that she SAW him looting it.  Oh well.. what are you going to do?<br />
