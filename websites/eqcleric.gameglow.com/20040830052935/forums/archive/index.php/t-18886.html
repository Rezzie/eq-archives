<br />
I am looking for a server that caters to Asia play times or a guild that is on Asia play times who is looking for a new cleric to join their ranks.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that I am on Venril Sathir, and there is no way to get offa there, so I am stuck with creating a new toon.<br />
<br />
I know that there are probably zero guilds in PoP progresion who will join me up at level 1 naked, so I am just looking to get in on the ground floor somewhere where I can have people playing in my time zone.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions brothers and sisters?</div></div><hr />

Stars now reguarly field over 130 people at prime time and do two raids at the same time. Raid A doing Kod Taz+, Raid B doing Elemental + Time.<br />
<br />
You also got a Euro guild (Two elemental Gods down) and a few American guilds if your playtime changes again.</div></div><hr />
