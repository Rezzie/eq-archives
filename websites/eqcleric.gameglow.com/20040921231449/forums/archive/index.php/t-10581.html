Group with a Druid. Kill Shakryn (6 minute spawn) OVER and OVER as well as any Chargers and Coursers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks<br />

SoW is very nice if things go wrong, especialy as the centaurs run so fast  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paladin</div><div class="date">10-30-1999, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other good thing about druids is their Snare spell.<br />
<br />
Snare is more reliable and longer lasting than root.  Also, if a snared monster wants to run away then it turns its back and stops trying to hit you...a rooted critter will keep swinging until the end.  A monster with 1 health point remaining hits just as hard as one with full health.<br />
<br />
One final note, if things go bad and you are gonna die, always always always get a /loc because finding your corpse is a real bummer in the wide open plains.  If you are running away and it doesnt look like your gonna make it then just be still and do the /loc and try to die on that spot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinur</div><div class="date">11-01-1999, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">None, Centaurs dont have faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breene</div><div class="date">11-02-1999, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. No faction hits<br />
<br />
2. Close to zone in case you get mor then you can handle.<br />
<br />
3. A druid is a must for harmony.  for the past 3 weeks we have been pulling directly outof the huts they reside in. People are just now catching on (on Xegony). target the MOB after harmony and pull from the backside of the tent. Safe to fight AWAY from the tents.<br />
<br />
4. Decent loot (black pearls on Chargers, ringmail on alomost all of them, as well as pages etc...)<br />
<br />
5. A vendor that will sell to EVERYONE (Ulan Meadowgreen)<br />
<br />
At the same time, your druid can pick up on Aviak Avocets that run by, and the rare NPC's (Have killed 5 in 3 weeks). got the Crown of Leaves, Feathered Leggings and 2 bark shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">11-02-1999, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am at the treants and nobody attacks the centaur village. being a dark elf i have had my eye on the place. <br />
<br />
question- if i am at level 30 and pull, will the Vendor or anything 50+ come out with the pull? The trash i can take out with my group and the Chargers would be nice, but a Named Vendor or someting would not be so nice.<br />
<br />
also, about what level are the chargers. They are still red to me at 27 as are the Avocets.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breene</div><div class="date">11-03-1999, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your puller is Lvl 30, you can pull right out of the tents without pulling the foals and shelties.<br />
<br />
Shakrn is blue to me at 31. Ulan (the vendor) is blue at 30.<br />
<br />
you can pull from the North pole (flagpole) or south pole (flagpole) safely without pulling the whole camp.<br />
<br />
Chargers: Lvl 29-31 &lt;blue at 31&gt;<br />
Coursers: Lvl 27-29 &lt;still blue at 31&gt;<br />
Archers:  Lvl 26-28 &lt;half are blue at 31&gt;<br />
Shelties and foals &lt;low 20's&gt;<br />
<br />
Those are all guesstimates using the ever popular CON. We all know how accurate that is.</div></div><hr />

He's faster then SoW and he'll be hitting your back all the way to the zone. <br />
That's why a druids snare can be a real boon here.<br />

<br />
Hint# Dont fight the avos at this point..Unless you really like running to the zone alot and like to stand around in a laggy zone full of druids  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Better yet you should go in rathe montians killing the cycops and giant skells or even better those nice Hill Giants.. I like to kill those hill giants.. all con red and give good loot. So go there give a shout and look for a full group with lvl 30 to 36 and you should be ok. Then go kill dogs later when the group is gone for fast xp.</div></div><hr />
