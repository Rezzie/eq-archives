<br />
I mean, by 60, we mainly use 2 heal spells. Complete Heal and Celestial Elixer. Divine Light is a mana HOG and is only used when you don't have the 6 extra seconds a Complete Heal takes.<br />
<br />
Each and Every focus item effect specified that spells that heal over time and complete heal are not included.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste Focus Items:<br />
Does not affect Complete Heals<br />
Does not affect Spells with less than a 3 second cast time<br />
Does not affect Spells that last less than 72 seconds in duration<br />
<br />
Duration Focus Items:<br />
Does not effect Invulnerability Spells<br />
Does not effect Heal Over Time spells<br />
<br />
So, what's left? Well, we can summon our useless pet faster and for only 450 mana instead of 600 mana. (WOOT...not) <br />
<br />
We can nuke alittle harder, for  alittle less mana..oooooh, watch out world, I'm a wizard now...not.<br />
<br />
About the only good thing I see coming out of this is I get to save alittle cash once in a while. IF I want to carry around an RMB on the 1 in 8 chance it will save me a peridot or 4.</div></div><hr />

I know I didn't.<br />
<br />
As far as I see, CH is what it is.  It doesn't appear that it will ever change.<br />
<br />
The main benefits I see from the new focus items are in the buffing arena.  Of course, not a single piece of my equipment has a focus effect, so I guess I'm back in the market for new gear.<br />

<br />
Which leaves clerics screwed and ignored.<br />
<br />
The only cleric improvement of any note that I can see is that with the right set of equipment Divine Light is now faster and more efficient than Celestial Elixir.  If I can hunt up some new equipment with the appropriate effects, and that equipment is actually preferable to my other items, I might save a spell slot on CE.<br />

So, maybe I'll start carrying around a Cougar Claw Earring along with that RMB, just in case...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a game design perspective, Verant would love to be rid of CH all together.  It's certain that we'll never see an increase in its ability.  Don't look for improvements there.<br />
<br />
Look at poor DL again with spell haste, improved healing, extended range, and mana preservation:<br />
<br />
DL before: 350mana 955hp 4.5 cast 100 range<br />
DL after: 315mana 1137hp 3.8 cast 115 range<br />
<br />
That's a pretty sizable increase.  With HA3, DL would heal more than CE unless that 5th tick lands.  (Some get a 1200hp heal, others a 1500hp heal, some get a mix depending how ticks land)<br />
<br />
I can't see how any change that makes DL an all-around better heal than CE is perceived as a bone tossed to us.<br />
<br />
And Judgement is pretty awesome with improved damage.  Almost wish I didn't have a cazic halo or I'd seek out a square helm to wear outside raids.</div></div><hr />

Cheal is already a very efficient spell.  To make it moreso would only make high end encounters much much easier and force verant to retune them all.  How can anyone say that clerics lack in healing ability?  <br />
<br />
You say you want better soloing ability--well now you can get items that make your nukes hit for 20% more damage.  You can also get items that make your spells (besides cheal) cost 10% less mana.  So if you choose your items right you can get Judgement to nuke for 1110 damage for 280 mana. Hmmm...that sounds pretty good to me.  No you are never going to be an uber soloer, but here is a chance for you to be better at it.  <br />
<br />
Also I don't think spending 15% less on jewels for symbol is anything to sneeze at.  Nor is saving 10% mana on buffs and having them last 15% longer.  <br />

I have yet to see the reagent saving focus save ANYthing, even for my mage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point is celaire is that CH is the spell that the entire cleric class revolves around.  Without it, the class would be infinitely weak.  <br />
<br />
We don't need an upgrade of 20%, we need an upgrade of 300% if we are to be doing the damage that a poorly equiped paladin will be doing overtime, and I don't think matching the weakest melee class in terms of damage is asking too much.<br />
<br />
All of the focus items helped other classes do what they primarily do better.  Clerics primarily CH people.<br />
<br />
Thats all we do - so there was no improvement here for clerics - and what was even worse - the competition got closer, all of there heal spells got better, costing less mana and cast faster - yes ours did too, but we don't cast ours that often - other classes do.<br />
<br />
Imagine this - All melee classes but paladins got their damage output increased by 20%.  Instead of this, paladins got their nukes upgraded by 20%.  There would be an outcry - the upgrade for paladins is useless - because they don't use them, and the rest of the field just got further away.<br />
<br />
The problem with class balancing is that it must be done with respect to all other classes, not on its own.<br />
<br />
And whilst this patch is good - it moves clerics further and further away from the rest of the pack.  Something that clerics were already struggling with outside the raid environment.<br />
<br />
If Vi doesn't look at clerics soon - the person who plays a cleric for fun, rather than a bot for a raid will be a thing of the passed, that is if it isn't already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saarem</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cel, starters so is the buff duration SELF only.<br />
<br />
Second, druids gained equally in healing power and got more powerfull DDs but also have dots. Same for shamans (who easy outdamage us with DD simply through canni more mana for nukes where we can not and if you toss in dots to it...) etc.<br />
<br />
So if we lose relative power with the other priests how is it not a nerf? Or should we call it balance? We got CH so we are balanced anyway right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ambul Ants</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure about the range not working on heals? I realy thought that would be helpfull.  I'll test tonight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aean</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the way i see it, is that these new items have raised up all the caster and hybrid classes. However, clerics get the short end of the stick yet again. Not every class will benefit greatly from every new concept brought into the game, but really this is just going to make druids and shaman even more valuable to exp groups.<br />
<br />
The effects on these items, from a cleric's standpoint are good, but nothing to write home about. IF they are on a piece of equipment I already have, or on something that drops that I would have as regular equipment then it's a bonus. But so far there isn't really anything that I would go out of my way to get.<br />
<br />
So that leaves me with 2 bits of hope for the cleric. 1, this is the first bit of focus items, more are coming on higher level items, hopefully verrant will make a few cleric only focus items with some effects that will help clerics (and i'm sure all classes would get something like this) specifically like a Holy Symbol that would increase damage to undead by X%. And hope 2 is that they just finished the pet classes, so we're up next. but i'm not holding my breath, we've seen their balancing in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dikmer</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I didn't expect Complete Heal to change.<br />
<br />
However, adding a longer duration to our Celestial's would have been nice. 15% increase would not have made it heal any more, but WOULD have eliminated the differnce in the &quot;lost tick&quot;. It would have increased the duration of Elixer just long enough that it would ALWAYS heal the 1600 points it should.<br />
<br />
And lowering the mana cost on our Celestial's by a paltry 15% would not have been earth shattering. Yeah, yeah, leave Complete Heal alone, NEVER, EVER change that spell. I get it already. But for pete's sake, allow us to do what we do...HEAL.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should give up on being THE healing class, and get some focus items to allow me to nuke harder. Then again, I could just delete my cleric and start a wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qwenya</div><div class="date">06-05-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the changes to DL are more than a bone.  Add in specialization, SCM3, Healing Adept, and even Healing Gift, and you have a pretty powerful fast casting heal for less mana.<br />
<br />
My DL at HA1 and SCM3 barely dented my mana bar and was healing for 1155, critting for double that with 2310 at HG2.  Very nice heal and as far as I can see there are many situations someone has to be on DL duty. <br />

<br />
The problem is, I HATE exp grinding. I don't have time between raids, and I find it mind-numbingly b.o.r.i.n.g.<br />
<br />
Sure, for you clerics who can pump out the AA points, DL can be a nice heal, but for the rest of us, these focus items are too little, too late. EQ is supposed to be a game, not a career. I have a job, and a wife, and 5 kids. Grinding out AA points just isn't something I want to do, just to make 1 stupid heal a litle better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're asuming the rest of us have these AA abilities, which the majority of us don't. Add to this the fact that now druids and shaman are even more useful to both exp and raid situations and you leave us with the same problem we have been having, only greater. How does someone get all these AA points when we can't get into exp groups?<br />

<br />
I am a mother of 5 kids and a very busy lady.  <br />
<br />
Getting Healing Adept and SCM is not that many points.  I got most of them farming keys and ores.  I mean everyone needs 6 in general.  Then 12 for SCM (which I think has been covered on this board why every cleric should focus on first in Arch) and  a mere 2 in HA is all I have in that one.   We are talking about 20 points.  Not that many.  <br />
<br />
Even without the AA skills, I still say improving DL was awesome.  It is not a mana hog any more and they made it useable!  Focus items also work with Word of Restoration, which I use a lot.  <br />
<br />
IMO, they effectively gave those who do not have the time to get the AA skills a lot of the benefits those who did were getting.  I also love it I do not have to trade out my good gear for a mage item.<br />

It seems to me if you are a good cleric and fun to be around you will never hurt for a group.  And if this is about lower levels, have you not forgotten they just gave you guys improved rezzes that will make you attractive.<br />

As to raids, anyone see on FOH?  They have a very high need for clerics.  I have yet to have my guildleader tell me sorry we want the druids and shaman this raid.  Take tonight off.  <br />

<br />
I love playing a cleric.  I have never in 60 levels found it to be boring or not fun.  It is the most exciting and fun class to play for me.  And I have a 60 druid, a 51 paladin, and a 42 bard.  I have tired other classes.  I love my cleric.<br />

Depends on play styles and temperaments I imagine.  Many of my friends hate it and you could not pay them to play a cleric.<br />

But, given the choice (on a non-raid day) between logging in and just exp grinding someplace, and doing something with my kids, the latter usually wins out. Often times, I play a low level twink with my wife and 2 oldest kids. Sure, I could have logged in Dik for that time, and gotten an AA point, but that just doesn't seem important.<br />

They don't dare nerf CH in old zones, as they would have to completely rebalance the game.  New zones will be a testing ground for EQ2's healing system, and the focus items are part of that test.  Trade skills will also be big in EQ2, which is why Verant is suddenly interested in them.  Welcome to EQ2 Beta!</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I join the group in a majority of exp zones - the average exp the group goes down.<br />
<br />
Yup thats right - they get more exp without me.  <br />
<br />
Theres only so much leeching I can take - I don't like partnering with a mate and watch him get half the exp he was getting before I joined - even if it means I get 4x the exp I was getting solo.  There is such a disparity here in the end game where clerics and their measily 800 ish damage a minute gets out classed by everyone.<br />
<br />
Its not a case of not getting a group - its a case of feeling guility when getting one.<br />
<br />
I have seen groups make do with paladins healing - because healing is not needed to any degree.<br />

Where do you go then?  Are clerics now restricted to CT and ssrae groups only now?</div></div><hr />

I mean we do ae groups in Seb and  can get a point very quickly.  I am talking a couple wizards, a rogue, a monk, me, an enchanter...maybe a mage out of group.  Sometimes 3 wizards and the 2 boxed enchanter out of group.  Sometimes a wizard, necro, enchanter 2 rogues and me, We own Seb. <br />

We have done Hate with a ranger, 2 wizards, a necro, an enchanter, and me.  We did the first floor pops, all the mini bosses, and maestro.  No deaths. It was a blast, and great experience.<br />
<br />
I have done Chardok, Deep, CT, all kinds of groups.  I have healed for a ranger soloing in the Deep or Akheva.  We both get great experience.<br />
<br />
I am at a loss when you say people do not get experience with us. Sure I can group my druid with 3 wizard friends plus an enchanter and we can do fine.  But it is a lot slower experience than when I play my cleric. <br />
<br />
However, I am a healer, and I hope an artist at healing.  I do not try to nuke.  I do not try to be a druid or shaman.  I do what I do best, heal.  My parties pull off some amazing feats and people live when they think they are dead.  We push the edge of the envelope and look for challenges.  I find plenty of things to do.<br />
<br />
Do people die with me and do I make mistakes?  Oh yeah.  But my position on this is I am a healer.  I do what I do best and because of that my parties live and do amazing things.  We all get great experience and even money and have a fun time.  I love the focus items. They help me be a better healer.  I like that.<br />
<br />
YMMV,<br />

<br />
I did some small test with range extension to see how it works. I was using a Cugar Claw Earring (Range Extension III).<br />
<br />
Eyballing it, it looked like I could stand about 3-4 yards/meters further away and cast Complete Healing and 6-8 yards/meters further away with Remedy than without the earring. Not exactly a big difference to me. Oh well.<br />

<br />
Qwenya the point I was making is that the exp total per person was less for some people when they group with a cleric.<br />
<br />
For example I grouped with a paladin friend in acyrlia killin skeletons.<br />
<br />
Singly he could killed 6 before they respawned.  I could manage 2.<br />
<br />
Together we were killing between 8 and 9 per spawn.<br />
<br />
That means for me I got 4.5 kills in the same time - my exp went up, and he went down from 6 to 4.5.  This is what im talking about.  He gave up exp to group with me.<br />
<br />
And the same is true in most exp spots.<br />
<br />
This is not CT or ssrae im talking about - im talking about taking a few people not a few people to a place and doing things.<br />
<br />
Before kunark came out it was common for groups to be smaller than 6.  You had hunting partners and you could make ok exp with them - I remember a time in solb with a single warrior taking an entire spawn which had taken a group before and doing really well.<br />
<br />
The other day there was a shaman soloing in CT, I buffed him because I was bored and the group I had might have just finished and he offered to duo with me.  I told him he would be getting awful exp with me, but he just wanted a bit of company.<br />
<br />
The fact is clerics add no damage to a group - you may say that you don't wish to cause damage, but in exp groups, damage output is the most important factor.  Thats why AE groups do so well because the damage per second is off the chart.<br />
<br />
Clerics have to heal in order to bring any type of worth to a group.  In a situation where healing is limited - we are just a drain.<br />
<br />
Thats not a nice feeling - being so utterly limited in our options.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qwenya</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to each is own...my point is you are only as limited in your options as you choose to be.  There are a plethora of options and things to do and ways to do it.  I am sorry but I refuse to jump on the bandwagon saying my class stinks, we are limited, we got screwed, we blah blah blah and wallow in negativity.  I see a lot of positives with these. <br />

Looks like alot of class envy to me.<br />
<br />
Take reagent conservation:<br />
Saving 15% of the peris I use is not a small sum, and I bet Qwen uses ALOT more than I do.<br />
<br />
Extended range is also nice. I've had many a tank go OOR or the screaming druid/wizzie running too far away from the nasty mob they can't kite   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Improved healing: Yout bet!<br />
<br />
Spell haste: I'm all in for that.<br />
<br />
More damage: Heck yes! *grabs his Dawnfire*<br />
<br />
But I do still find it odd that they left CH out on quite a few foci. Probably because we clerics are all to powerfull allready   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
