<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">03-24-2000, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My solution is simple: a repeated NO! just works wonders for me.<br />
<br />
For the longest time I hated refusing Res requests because of this site, didn't want people to come here calling me a jerk, whatever.  I learned that I was rather unknown and I could safely just say &quot;No&quot;  &quot;I'm too busy&quot; etc.  I DO like to try to res people whenever possible, but I rarely inconvenience my group anymore (I used to be rather bad about that).<br />
<br />
As far as item/money beggars, I've pretty much said no from day 1.  I earned it, they can too has always been my policy.<br />
<br />
I did have a rather amusing story happen recently.<br />
<br />
I'm running around Felwithe when some relatively low level (his equipment looked level 10) asked me for spare equipment.  I said no and kept running.  He came back with a &quot;Fine then!&quot; which rather pissed me off, but I didn't get into an argument with him.<br />
<br />
In the meantime I had logged my friends wizard in and gated him to Felwithe (I have two comps) and was getting ready to port Rayne.  Up comes the beggar offering money for a teleport.  &quot;75pp? Sure.&quot;  His friend shows up and I charge him another 25pp just to get a round number.  I teleport him over, and have to smile.  I don't charge for res's, and don't charge for ports.  But in his case I had to make an exception.  100pp for 5 minutes I can handle.<br />
<br />
I've often wondered how much money I could make in an evening offering ports for cash.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry, but begging is a skill and for the skill to work you must target an NPC and press the BEG button.<br />
<br />
Half don't have a clue as to what I'm talking about and think I'm just being rude (who cares?  They were rude to ask to begin with.)<br />
<br />
The other half understand what I mean and get the message.  <br />
<br />
I only get replies back about 1 in 10 times and it's usually &quot;sorry&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it was bound to happen to me, but last night, I logged in to where I had camped just out side of Cazic. I had not been on more than 2 minutes (long enough to move from the front to one of the small temples to hide and med) when I get this tell<br />
<br />
newbie &quot;Hello, can you give me some help&quot;<br />
me &quot;like what?&quot;<br />
newbie &quot;I'm having some problems and really want sow, can you powerlevel me to 9&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I thought about laying into him, after all, I earned my levels (still only 24 as my highest char, after a year), instead I fell back on the &quot;I do not have time, sorry&quot;<br />
<br />
hehe, got a quick &quot;thx&quot; and did not hear from him again</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beggar: Dood, can I have some plat?<br />
Tach: Well, I don't much like beggars, but if you amuse me, I'll give you some plat.<br />
Beggar:Ok dood, what ya want me to do.<br />

<br />
Beggar: Now can I have my plat dood?<br />
Tach: One more thing my loathesome friend.  Shout to all of my benevolance and greatness.<br />
<br />
/beggar shouts: Tach is da man!  He's really cool and stuff.<br />
<br />
Beggar: Dood, can I have my plat now?<br />
Tach: Yes, you will understand that I do not touch such filth as beggars, so you can get the money from the ground.<br />
<br />
Tachyon drops 100sp on the ground.<br />
<br />
Call me cruel, but if they are going to belittle themselves by begging, then they deserve all they get!<br />

My husband is an enchanter, and he is constantly having people beg him for clarity.  So he makes people dance for him.  Some actually get offended and call him names, but most laugh, dance, and get clarity.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
There was a little twerp the other day near Felwithe (I was hanging out at the gate, buffing newbies cause it's fun) who was wandering up to people, saying:<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm desprit can I have some money pls?&quot;<br />
<br />
So this other little newbie, who had the damn crappy club and was totally nekkid says:<br />
<br />
&quot;You can have mine, it's not much but it's all I have.&quot;<br />
<br />
God knows, the nice newbie was only 3rd level so it probably wasn't more than 3 or 4 gold.  But she gave the little twerp all her money.  The little twerp (who I might add had a staff and a robe) continued to beg for money.<br />
<br />
Finally I said, &quot;Hey Solitary, instead of pestering people for free money, why don't you take the enormous buff I just gave you and go kill stuff for money?&quot;<br />
<br />
She said, &quot;ok&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she walked up and did a /bonk on me and wandered off.  ooooookkk!  So I gave the nice newbie about 10pp and told her NOT to give it to beggars.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  She said, &quot;Ok&quot; and promptly strolled into Felwithe.  10 minutes later she emerged with leather armor and a new staff.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  I was so proud.  (She was a cleric by the way)<br />
<br />
Can't stand beggars - I usually tell them no, humiliate them, or ignore them.  All are viable.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  It's the ones who SCREAM over shout repeatedly that really deserve the humiliation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarwes</div><div class="date">04-12-2000, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This happened to me last weekend.  I was in Greater Faydark with my lvl 20 warrior (secondary character) when this naked lvl 1 druid comes up to me and buffs me with her lvl 1 spells.  She then asked me for any spare money.  I realized her buffing me was an obvious ploy to make me feel obligated to give her something but I was in a good mood so I played her silly game.  I gave her 19gp, not alot but for a lvl 1 a nice sum of money.  She thanked me and went on her way.  Not 5 minutes later this same person did an auction...she was selling an executioner's axe!  I couldn't believe it!  I sent her a tell asking her how she could do something like that and her explination was that she was starting and new monk and needed the money!  ARGGG!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Norok</div><div class="date">04-19-2000, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I have been called many names and actually deserve a good many.<br />
<br />
But I am Full EM gear so even going /role is of no use you can see me a mile away.<br />
<br />
When I get Ress/Buff beggers my standard reply is &quot;No I do not have time to ress you&quot;<br />
<br />
If they continue to beg I say &quot;No I do not want to ress you&quot;<br />
<br />
If they continue to beg or get rude then I say &quot;Show me where your body is&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I ask if they are ready for ress anc once I get the OK I cast.<br />
<br />
After the spell is cast and I get the initial &quot;Thank you&quot; I say<br />
&quot;No thanks is necessary that Revive only cost me 300 mana and the fact that you cannot get exp back no matter how much you bug someone else leaves me in a much better mood. So Thank you for improving my general mood for the evening.  Oh and By the way NO means NO.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then by default they go on my ignore list until they are replaced by anothe Llama.<br />
<br />
I have been level 50 for a long time and help those I can but I do not appreciate beggers and whiners and if I come over as a complete A$$ then perhaps these whiners and beggers will think twice about bothering a complete stranger and getting rude when they say no.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how FEW repeat beggers I have too  =)<br />
