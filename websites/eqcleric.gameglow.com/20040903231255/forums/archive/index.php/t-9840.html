<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">04-21-2000, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I finally got 24th level last night in SolA (with the help of my friends Kairtane, Cougara, and Rudar). After a full night of hunting I was full of heavy coin, so I decided to make the run through Nek Forest and bank in FP. Bad move on my part.<br />
<br />
A dragoon was standing behind the rock as you come into the Nek zone there, and proceeded to tear me up and kack me before I could blink twice. Welcome to level 23...<br />
<br />
Everytime I have gotten a significant level as a cleric it seems that death waits around the next bend. Does anyone else percieve this cloud above them, or am I just a doomed soul?<br />

<br />
The DING! sound is there for a reason.  <br />
<br />
It announces to all mobs within three zones that you have leveled and need to be eaten.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone needs to tell them that only High Elves are crunchy and taste good with ketchup. This explains the hungry looks in their eyes though - I thought I was just paranoid.<br />

It seems to be built into the game. Whenever you lvl, the mobs do their damndest to !GNID you. Most visible and painful is when you just get a new spell lvl and lose your new toys    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif (usually I get a spell lvl about 4 times or so until it sticks...)<br />
<br />
What may help to keep this from happenening is the following (it's my strategie from now on...).<br />
If you lvl to a new spell circle rejoice, tell everyone and then go on as if nothing happened. Keep using the old spells, keep fighting the same mobs as before the lvl. Scribe the new spells if you got them (I usually lug them around for the whole lvl before I can scribe them) BUT DO NOT USE THEM YET! Try to lock in the lvl until you have a tleast a bub into it before you leave the group, go sell, camp, pick up spells or whatever. That way if you die you won't lose the lvl (tho 3 consecutive deaths in Unrest in 10 minutes will defy any precautions    http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif).<br />
<br />
Then take some time away from fights, max all skils you can, make sure your fizzles on the new spells are over (GHeal was wonderful, but a mana hog and fizzle city when I first started using it at 24).<br />
<br />
Anyway, this works for me... try it for size and see if it does for you.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have tips or strategies to counter the dreaded !GNID ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiganos</div><div class="date">04-21-2000, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, basically stay with the group that helped you get the level and get a buffer first...<br />
<br />
About the only thing that's kept so many of my levels was doing just that. Before that, I'd run off and go train and do a wonderful job of going !GNID  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
I lost level 19 like 12 times, making it an alltime record for me. I'm 50 now, so it's not an issue anymore, but I've learned to stick it out and get those buffers. They're important.</div></div><hr />

I prefer 1 bubble of exp (losing 1 complete bubble since 26 kinda makes it hard for me not to require myself not to do that), but if 20 or 30 bubbles are availible....=)<br />
<br />
Oh, and if it makes you feel better, i set off 2 levels before my next spell ring with all spells in my pack just in case I find a good hunting spot and don't want to leave =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">04-24-2000, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best thing is to buy and carry your new spells (if applicable) with you the level before you make the spell level.<br />
<br />
Then you don't endanger yourself by &quot;running to town to get&quot; your spells.  And keep a buffer - if you've been making exp, stay there.   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rauntek</div><div class="date">04-25-2000, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Carry around scrolls for two levels in case you have a good hunting spot? *amazed look*... does that mean that people other than I actually gain a level or more per session? I am usually thrilled if I get even a single bubble per session, as that happens far to rarely.. am I doing something critically wrong here?<br />
Besides, I usually have to run to town far more often to drop off coin than to get scrolls...I seem to be the only person in my parties bothering to loot for coin anymore either. hm.<br />
(24..25th by the way, currently in Mistmoore)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thortak</div><div class="date">04-25-2000, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for all of the suggestions. The specific cirsumstance behind this rant is that my group had finished hunting for the night, and since I was very heavy with coin, I decided to try and hit the bank in FP.<br />
<br />
Anyway - thank you for all of the responses. I am half a bubble from 25th level now and looking forward to 29th level.<br />
<br />
Hehe ever onward...<br />

Four bubbles in the four days since you posted this.. Alright, I *must* be doing something wrong... (By the by, Mistmoore is a nice place for the level, I think. Assuming one can find a group. I miss soloing *snif*)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tsedek</div><div class="date">04-30-2000, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My newly learned strategy for not losing levels in Kunark:  Do NOT go exploring without at least 3 friends!  I got three bubbles into level 37 and due to my insatiable curiosity (and about 100pp worth of invis potions that the mobs saw through) I'm down to just one bubble.  My most-hated death was running through the ice tunnel in the dreadlands, on my way to meet a druid who was taking me to a guild event.  Who knew so many giants, spiders, and mega-gnolls lived in that tunnel?<br />

I'm glad I'm not the only one!<br />
I buy my spells at least two levels before and start carrying them around one level before rank.  I call it motivation.<br />
<br />
It gives me something to focus on if I'm at a boring camp.  Another plus is that it drives me to leave a &quot;bad&quot; group when I know we're either over our heads or I don't feel comfortable with the play style of others.<br />
<br />
And a buffer is a must  :-)<br />
I lost 24 and without thinking went to remem my new spells.  OUCH!  That really hurt.<br />

I buy all my spells after each hell level. I spend a lot of time away from town, and away from kaladim especially, considering I'm kos in fp for some reason.... An qey is a log way away. Sometimes I can go through to 4 levels easy before I even think about leavin the zone... Besides after 30 theres no reason to go to your guild other then to buy spells, and no reason to go to town other then to bank.<br />
