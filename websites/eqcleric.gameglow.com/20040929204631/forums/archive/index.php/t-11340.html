<br />
Why dont you make it so the cleric controls the CH still...<br />
<br />
I guess what I was thinking would be that the Druid/Shm CH require a 55+ (someone else pick the level) cleric to cast a VERY low mana/Very low cast time spell on the Druid/Shm. After they recieve this &quot;buff&quot; they would be able to cast the 75% CH.<br />
<br />
What this does is lets you have as many druids as you have come to the raids, help out, and be &quot;required/usefull&quot; (pick the best phrase). <br />
<br />
On the other hand the druid still has his normal heals and the normal versitility that they offer to the normal exp grind.<br />
<br />
This brings and upgrade to raids while hurting the cleric in the least possible way.<br />
<br />
Yes you are still dependant on at least one Cleric to attend a Raid but hey its better than being dependant on 6!<br />

<br />
My only problem is that so many want to concentrate on more healing for Clerics.  I pointed out elsewhere that healing has a ceiling.  If that is all we can do, then we are bound to be doomed beause they can't do anything more for us once that ceiling is reached.  Blaming Druids and Shamans is not the asnwer as many Items in the game also affect healing and the usefullness of Clerics.  I don't want to have to scrutinize every spell and item that gets introduced and argue against it because it will make my class obsolete.  Lets face it, new things have to be put in the game because new thing are one of the big reasons people keep playing.<br />
<br />
 Let an item come in that lets a warrior heal themselve say 200 hp.  We'd have to fight against it because that would cut into our role.  Say Verant nerfs it.  Watch how fast we lose any support from warriors cause we ruined a good item.  I'd rather play with people that want me in their group, thaan with someone who begrudgingly takes me because I'm the only one around who can fill a need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biggwin</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye, I agree totally with you. I dont blame druids (I have a 60 druid on his own account and a 51 druid on my play account). I just really dont want to make such a huge stomp on the clerics &quot;main role&quot; in the game.<br />
<br />
I know clerics that already have a hard time getting groups because with a good tank a druid/shm can already fill that role and offer so much more than a cleric.<br />
<br />
I dont have a cleric personally but my wife plays one. I know she cannot get anywhere near the exp that my druids can in any situation. Her best hope for exp is to be in an exp group and I dont want to see that crushed.<br />
<br />
I want options for a better solution!</div></div><hr />

Both sides are making good arguments, and it's a shame that probalby only one will win.  But we can't have it all.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps soon we can make one thread for the topic, but right now so many are wanting to make sure there voice is heard, they start new threads for it.</div></div><hr />
