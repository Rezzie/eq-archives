<br />
Is the Testing Halls roughly the same? Same type of mobs/AE's etc?<br />
<br />
If not, what is different and what's to know?<br />
<br />
Any advice is appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">06-04-2001, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was there last night (I'm CoV+ faction). We farmed HoT for 9 hours.  Only 1 drop in the first 6 hours... after that we got 3 more in a couple more hours, and one stupid spell that sells on vendors.  /sigh<br />
<br />
I think all the mobs are 60+.  It is possible to do with 2 groups 55+.  CR was not all that bad, had one CR session where someone was summoned into a pit.  <br />
<br />
Lots of AE stuff, but casters/healers should stay by the doorway (to the CoV+ part of the Temple) and stay out of the AE as long as they keep the dragon pinned in the corner with the firepots.  Ping ponging is really nasty here... I'd advise shamans to be up close with the meleers to cast slow/malo otherwise you will ping pong the mob and your clerics will be oom after every fight from having to heal the entire group.<br />
<br />
If you pull more than one it probably will mean death.  Have a cleric with a res stick bound outside ToV at the lightning thingies. Might be a good idea for everyone to leave something on their corpse so they can be re-ressed in in case they were summoned far away... that way a necro can summon their body and you don't have to worry about teleporting them in.<br />
<br />
Take at least 1 bard and one necro to get the clerics back up to full after CR or particularily nasty fights.  Have the necro pump up the clerics and the bard sing mana song.  Our enchanter did mana sieve on the casting dragons.<br />
<br />
There was a debate raging about whether having the door open during a battle and having AE hit the drakes outside was a bad thing or not...  We did have them aggro on us once.  One time for corpse dragging, the other time I couldn't figure out why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">06-04-2001, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, one thing I noticed is that dragging ANY corpse causes aggro. <br />
<br />
Being an ally to the COV myself, I got a little too close to one of the wurms in the testing halls.<br />
<br />
While I chuckled about that, I was dragging my self a little futher out to make sure I wouldn't agro the testing halls wurm.<br />
<br />
Zemm the drake got really mad at me for pulling my own corpse around, lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">06-04-2001, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I've dragged my own corpse just fine past Zemm plenty of times.  The irritating thing is if you fight the KoS mobs in that room after Zemm too close to the door, the +CoV mobs will help the KoS mobs and wipe you out. *sigh*  Zemm will kill you if you drag somebody elses corpse, even an ally, but I've never seen him kill anybody for dragging there own corpse.<br />
<br />
As for CoV Test hall raids, I'd try and jack up your Cold resists.  That is the only resist that matters, and yes with a good cold resist I have fairly consistently resisted alot of the AoE's that you occur.  I would agree that 2 really good groups could do it, but 3 is more comfortable and anything more then 4 groups and you will probably have to wait for stuff to spawn after you complete the loop.<br />
<br />
As for drops, we get streaky.  1 mob cycle we've gotten as much as 12 drops, only to turn around and clear the next set to only get 1 or 2 drops.  I would say an average # of drops per clearing would be 7-8 for all the mobs (not counting the named who only drop the quest bits).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that you mention it, maybe it was someone else's corpse...<br />
<br />
Alliliel has gotten more forgetful. (255)<br />
<br />
It *sounds* like it's the same as fighting the Kael quest baddies in the west wing as far as mob type and difficulty. Can anyone confirm that?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">06-04-2001, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've only killed the mobs in the test hall, but I would suspect that they are no harder then the mobs the pro-giant people kill in their wing/wings.  With a good puller you should get mostly singles the majority of the raid, and even with 2, if you have a 2nd warrior to tank the add it's not that hard (except maybe if you only had 2 groups) unless you have 2 mobs that AoE (Fiery guardians and Burning guardians, they are red; Anchient guardian wurms and Anchient Frost guardian wurms, they are white).  The 4 listed before have 2 different AoE's that all save vs cold for a max damage of 400 a pop I believe.  The other mobs have either no AoE or it's insignificant.  Wyverns (various names) Harm Touch and have nasty melee output as do the Racnars (no HT).  The named mobs also have fairly nasty melee output and there might be 1 pull where you get 2 named, but I think this can be avoided if you don't want to do it.  Other named have to be killed if you want to get to all the mobs (if I recall correctly).  All the white dragons will attempt to complete heal and some of the caster mobs will try to gate (which is what makes the 2 group thing dicey maybe) and if they gate depending on where you are could be ugly if they start summoning and stuff.  Some of the drake things will also try to complete heal (can't remember their names).</div></div><hr />
