He is about level 19-21ish and is blue to you up to level 27 or so.  He has a 3 minute spawn time and often drops FS weapons to boot.<br />
<br />
His loc is -5400, -2400 for anyone that wants to try.  You can solo him easily at 24+ (still a problem on occasion at 23).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziggi</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You dont take any faction hit for killing the hermit.  My brother was hunting him with some friends and I was expecting him to get some nasty faction hits but whenever the hermit would die he would say something about some druids avenging him (the usual death vengence thing) But NO faction change was given.  I love things that dont screw my faction over in some far off land that i wont remember about till its to late hehe =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bedor</div><div class="date">11-18-1999, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Ziggi, im not close enough to justify the run if it was going to screw my faction. But since it doesnt im relocating. Hooray soloing again!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nikkie</div><div class="date">11-20-1999, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think an excellent spot to solo is in Rathe Mountains.  There is an undead site next to the Bindlegrob and Thindlegrob site (very close to Feerrott zone)  I'm now lev 26 and started here at 24.  should be good here for another 2-4 i think.  there is an assortmant of undead giant skels, barbed skes, dbs', monk,and ice bone, and zombies.  Its a delicate matter to pull cause they are grouped so close, but if you get in over your  head, feerrott is very close to zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whackem Smackem</div><div class="date">11-29-1999, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unrest is also a very good solo zone when it is crowded. You can go up to the 2nd floor, invis undead, and hunt for anything you find on that floor. I would only recommend this if the magi room is camped, as that provides a safe place to med after a fight. Also, the 2nd floor needs to be constantly cleared by others, but when there is a group in the magi room, they almost always are pulling from the 2nd floor as well... I actually made more xp soloing than in a group in unrest. But loot is better in groups.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quess</div><div class="date">12-06-1999, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thess is all wary nice spots but keep in mind that this is some of the last lvlels that you can solo on as cleric <br />
<br />
(you can only solo Specs if you speciales in you attack spells)<br />
<br />
and you mite get more out of groupin in the way that more well know you wen you hit lvl 29 and there for easyer find a group there ...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">12-07-1999, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quess: If that was true, why are there spectre hunting guides and quite a few notes about spectre hunting in 34-38 and up hunting forums? I am pretty sure that I could take out a spectre now, by myself, at level 39. It might not be worth the long downtime afterwards though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quess</div><div class="date">12-09-1999, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True that a cleric can kill a Spec that is not what i am saying ... i am saying that as a cleric you well be better off partying from lvl 29... and there for it mite be smarter to start to party all ready from 24-28 so that you well get to know ppl.... <br />
<br />
if you Specialise in anty undead spells and not healing it well pay off to solo Specs but that is going agenst the basis of bieng a cleric ..... being  Healing <br />
<br />
pps: this is ofcors all my apinion and what i see as the job of a Cleric <br />
