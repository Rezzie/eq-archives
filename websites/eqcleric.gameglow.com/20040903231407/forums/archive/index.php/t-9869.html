<br />
Since I have nothing better to do, I invite him, and invis him and send him on his merry way.<br />
<br />
5 mins later I get a tell saying that he died and this must be my fault. I tell him that it's not my fault he died due to running into that nasty bat that follows you sometimes and ruins yer invis, and then he becomes nasty and starts to swear at me.<br />
<br />
Bah.. again, how is this my fault?<br />

You try to be nice, and people hold it against you. Some things like this really make me tempted to go back to a single player game.<br />

(as opposed to being able to run back and have you bail him out)  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif <br />

People like this boggle my mind. Hehe what a nimrod. <br />

<br />
I Invis to Undead'd (lol) a 30 Warrior that was running through Kithicor at night (I told him to wait for daylight, because it's safer, but he said it was an emergency).<br />
<br />
Anyway, he sends me a tell from Arena (ouch) asking for a revive.  I asked him if he died, and he said it was all my fault....Okay.....All my fault huh?<br />
<br />
The reason he died is because he saw a dread wolf, which are -not- undead, so it found him, and ruined his invis, and he ended up getting his share of wrath from the Cleric ghouls....<br />
<br />
Anyway, I refused to revive him since he was throwing all these cuss words at me and stuff...  But, I hate how people blame you for things -they- should have been watching out for.<br />

I don't think that describes this guy adequately.  I think you may need the help of NASA and the government's finest to track down this guy's brain =)  This guy was obviously an idiot, and if I were you, I'd put him on my ignore list and forget about him completely.<br />
