<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doctoriee</div><div class="date">11-09-1999, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night, we have a full group ranging 20-23 in unrest, the magi room. <br />
We were doing fine clearing the room until the tanks and the wiz became restless of the 8-10min spawn rate. They kept on wondering off to different room, (bar, hands etc) dispite of my warning about train. Leaving the defenseless necro (cant have pet in dungeon.. too dangerous) and the clerid (me) in the magi room alone. Sure enough, when they pull in all kinds of SK monks from outside, the magi ghoul and carion ghoul respawned..... and we all died.<br />
<br />
Err.. why can't people just sit tight... Greed.. it kills.<br />

<br />
Try and be more assertive next time... seize the day and DEMAND that if they want to live they need to listen to you..<br />
<br />
Know your limitations and ensure that those that do not.. are instructed that if they want to live they need to be aware of your limitations...<br />
<br />
Clerics we are...  Not Miracle workers...<br />
