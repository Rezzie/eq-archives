<br />
This quote was taken from the news thing on eq.castersrealm.  How can this be true, I know there are groups that work w/o a cleric and a tank, but usually are not as good as a cleric/tank group.  excluding AE groups, which btw usually use a cleric. I do not recall anyone in a 50+ group saying i wish we could get rid of this cleric for a druid/shaman.  I just think this statement is untrue, clerics have it pretty good besides making a bit of money on the gems you get to &quot;pay for peridots &quot; =p you get groups fairly easy, ive never seen a cleric go LFG for more than 10 minutes in sebilis unless its an odd time and they really got unlucky when the only other 6 are already grouped, but thats like never.  Clerics will always have the best hp/ac buffs the game can offer, that alone will get you all groups and make you needed.  Someone tell me im not off in my own world, there are clerics in almost every group and there are not usually enough clerics to go around, be it raid or xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aenia</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may be different for different servers, but clerics are easily replaceable in exp groups now and often are.  I've been in Seb, CT, Akheva, Grey and many other zones LFG only to get rez requests from groups who don't have a cleric in them.  When I ask if I can join their group, they'll say &quot;nah we're ok, thanks though&quot;.  I've sat in Seb countless hours LFG, but clerics can usually get a group there over other healers, it's just very crowded on my server ... same with CT.<br />
<br />
One reason you don't see clerics say /ooc 59 Cleric LFG or put the LFG tag on is people assume you have nothing better to do than rez them since you're LFG anyway.  This is a problem for other classes as well, namely wizards and druids with port requests.  There are a lot more of us LFG out there that you don't see.  When I'm LFG, I usually just send tells to people in the zone until I find a group.<br />
<br />
One huge disadvantage for a cleric looking for group is we have no easy way to move from zone to zone to find one that's not crowded.  If I'm bound outside the bub at Seb (or zone in to Akheva, or zone in to CT, or ...) and login and no groups are available, then I'm stuck there unless I can find a port.  Of course, now I can gate back to FP and run to WC to pay for a port to another zone to LFG some more.  But since the invent of the bazaar it can be quite difficult to find a port anywhere near FP (EC used to be our auction zone).<br />
<br />
People will say to me &quot;Why bind outside the zone then?  Just bind in the Nexus and you can get to anywhere&quot;.  Well that's fine and good for many classes, but if the main reason anyone even wants me in their exp group is so that if things go badly I can rez them, what good does it do for me to be dead and back at the Nexus when they're dead in Akheva or something?  If they're still going to have to beg for a rez from another cleric in zone, they woulda been better off with a druid healing them who can offer more to the efficiency of the group.<br />
<br />
Now that I'm in a good guild and have plenty of friends, I don't have the troubles I used to have finding groups.  Not every cleric has that priviledge and I didn't always so I know how they feel.  I see that Druids are saying on their msg board it's a myth that they don't have trouble finding a group, well it's also a myth that clerics are guaranteed an instant group upon logging in.  I think part of the problem is there are just so many druids and clerics out there, but at least druids can quad kite and solo for real exp.  I've always been dependant on a group to do anything.<br />
<br />
Yeah I know they're working on things and I hope things do get better, however I'm not very optimistic with the changes so far.  Only time will tell, but that still doesn't change how it was the last 40+ levels of my life :)<br />
<br />
Not even touching the &quot;making money with gems&quot; crap comment.  Leave Seb for a day and perhaps you'll get a bit better perspective on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hakken</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">95% of the time in a pickup group I am not given anything extra for my buffs.    So I wind up paying 10 plat (have chantie friend buy the dots for me) each time I buff.  Plus since I am medding, I usually wind up horribly short on looting side.   This is why increasingly so I only group with friends.<br />
<br />
I think as things stand now you will find many clerics only grouping with friends or guilds as those will be the main people giving the clerics groups.  I have been LFG many times for a long time in the day in DL.   Seems people want healers with SOW ability or slow ability.   It is all about dps and I as a cleric just dont offer that much.  <br />
<br />
Funny how the grass looks so much greener on the other side of the fence.   Druids complain about how wanted clerics are.  Why did they not make a cleric then?   Could it be cause they like the easy and fast leveling solo life.   I say lets see how much druids want to have better healing.  Have Sony offer them a chance to trade in tracking, foraging, SOW, snare, quad kiting and porting for the improved heal.   The comment made by druids is &quot;well you can buy all those effects in potions&quot;   yeah at a cost of 10+ plat each time I use it.   Maybe we should put a 10 plat cost every time the new heal is used.  <br />
<br />
Just wish the druids would realize how easy of a life they really do have in the pre 55 stage.   I know I have a 49 druid and they are so cake it is not even funny.   quad kite and kill 4 dark blue every 10 mins compared to a cleric killing one dark blue every 1/2 hour.   <br />
<br />
Start a druid and cleric out equally with equal play time and the druid will be at 55 by the time the cleric makes 40.  Maybe what they need is an exp modifier for soloing.   and make a 1/4 modifier for quading.</div></div><hr />
