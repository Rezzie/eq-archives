<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Odaer</div><div class="date">11-29-1999, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought that occured while reading a previous post on the subject of Item Farming by high levels...<br />
<br />
I've played on some other muds/online games where there have been some steps put in to prevent this.  <br />
<br />
One idea is more level limits.. there are level limits to enter the planes (lv 46+ I believe).. so why not put in some upper level limits on dungeons.  Granted this would not work on dungeons where you have to go through an easier area to get to the higher lev area (U/L guk) but might work for some areas.<br />
<br />
I.E.  After things become green to you you would receive a message upon trying to enter the zone about something to effect that you are too powerful to enter here...<br />
<br />
I.E.  After level 44ish you can no longer enter Unrest... or after level 30 you can no longer enter Crushbone etc...<br />
<br />
This would prevent some Power Level'n and some item farming... it WOULD be much harder to impliment on areas like Guk where you have to go through Upper to get to Lower... <br />
<br />
Anyways, just an idea.. Take it as you will..  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Make all of the decent loot items no drop.  Granted, that hurts people who want to help out their friends, too...  But I for one am tired of the level 50's camping all of the good stuff in lower guk, perma, etc...<br />
<br />
Even if Verant implements their play nice policy, those things are still blue to a level 50 -- so that doesn't solve anything.<br />
<br />
On a slightly different tangent, is it just me or is the new &quot;pay for all the cool things, aka Bag of Tinkerers/Box of Abu-Kar for 5250 pp&quot; policy just begging those 50's to do even MORE farming?  Sure, they need the money now, and how will they get it?  LOL  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkith</div><div class="date">11-30-1999, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">NO drop huh?<br />
<br />
Here's a scenario...<br />
<br />
Was in Lguk the other night.  Assassin was camped.  I have been tinkering around in Lguk and Sol B for the past couple of weeks.  <br />
<br />
A nice little shout rings out.  <br />
<br />
'LOL Its so easy to smuggle a level 9 in here for a Deceiver's mask'<br />
<br />
So much for No Drop.<br />
<br />
As well...what if..and its extreme...our warrior dies.  He's been camping the EXE axe with our group hoping to get one.  We have a choice..We can wait for him to get back the normal way...Rev/Res if its available...sit there in loot mode until he arrives and hope the spawn doesn't disappear and no one loots it from under us.<br />
<br />
Or as it is right now.  Get someone else to pick it up..then give it to him when he gets back.<br />
<br />
I don't think that making things NO DROP would solve things.  I do think that level restrictions (even equipping them, let alone using a proc), would be better.  It also would inspire alot more High level TRADING of items.  Money gets to be useless...you make so much of it each night simply fighting.  If there are level restrictions on items, you can't give to your twink, or a low level guildie an item.  If its an item your class can't use...you MUST trade or sell or give it to another LIKE LEVEL individual.  Otherwise it just takes up space.<br />
<br />
And if you are trading/selling/giving to a high level character...there is a good chance...that the item has already been acquired by them.  Thus its value goes down (less people buying/trading for them), and hence no high levels will farm it.  Its not worth it to them.  <br />
<br />
Why sit on your butt for a few hours camping an item.  Get it. Then get almost nothing for it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramulet</div><div class="date">12-03-1999, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you put a lot of level restrictions on equipment this would really piss off all the high level people twinking their second characters.<br />
Yeah I know a lot of the jealous people out there are going to whine about twinking, but this is only because you haven't reached level 50.<br />
I am not 50 yet, but group with 50s on occasion. One thing they talk about is being bored with the game. They spend their time getting good stuff for their twinks because they don't have anything better to do when there is not a big event going on for them to take part in.<br />
If they took this out of the game for them they would probably grow tired and quit the game. Being able to twink your second characters is really the only reward in this game for reaching level 50 when you think about it.<br />
<br />
Flame on if you wish, but once you reach 50 I GUARANTEE you will change your mind about twinking. All my friends who were against it originally have now changed their minds.<br />
Besides, when I was a young cleric in unrest my favorite tanks were the twinkers, their twinking doesn't take anything away from you only helps your group overall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkith</div><div class="date">12-08-1999, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am not doubting that at lvl 50 I would become bored, and the temptation to start item farming for a twink is huge.<br />
<br />
I'm near lvl 41 and I fee the urge to start a secondary character, and with all the items I've acquired and haven't done anything with...well its tempting.<br />
<br />
I dunno.  The best thing for me, I think, would be to start another character on another server...preferably a new one.  I'm hoping that when a new server comes up, I can do that.<br />
<br />
Argue if you want, but Twinking is an exploitable bug, but I don't think this bug alone would prompt Verant to make changes.  Farming the items for sale on E-Bay.  This I think would prompt changes.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, just perhaps, if you put level restrictions on items.  You would have people making legitimate 'NEWBIE' Characters when they reach level 50.<br />

<br />
I don't say this for farming purposes either.<br />
<br />
We're clerics, we ressurect people. Oh! Sorry, I can't ress you, I can't get in the zone.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif <br />
<br />
I don't think that's where we want to be.</div></div><hr />

Oh no, can't twink? Dear lord! Start a new char, complete if you really want, or, here's a radical idea, DO SOMETHING ELSE. Freaking A people. It's not like you can't play the game if you don't go around killing things.</div></div><hr />
