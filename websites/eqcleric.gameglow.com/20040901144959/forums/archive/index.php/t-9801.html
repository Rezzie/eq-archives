<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tachyon</div><div class="date">02-29-2000, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems to me that the clerical quest armor was made easier to get in just one way, namely they reduced the number of plat bars required.  Spawn times, or lack of them, seems to still be pretty much the same.  Has anyone else noticed this?  <br />
<br />
I camped Zahal the Vile with my druid friend for 20 hours straight last Sunday night.  Either he was killed by someone else, and we never had him on track, or he never spawned.  Is 20 hours too short to camp for him?  Does something trigger his spawn that I'm unaware of?  Any input is appreciated.<br />

Dont rely on tracking... sense dead works MUCH better. Stay at the north side of zone and cast sense dead until you spot Zahal.<br />

If there are lotsa Clerics in zone (always ask if someone is camping before You start up Your camp) or I get necro Pets (Grrrrr...) on track it gets trickier. But I always use the North wall (where Regis finally will spawn) as a form of base camp.<br />
<br />
My current bet is that Zahal is a 8 hour 30 minute spawn but there are indications that he might spawn as often as every 4 hours 15 minutes. (Geee... Ain't questing fun?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use sense the dead. It works alot easier than track in NK. Necro pets will still be a pain tho  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

I've seen Babbinsbort twice, camped by other clerics at the time.  I've seen Maugrim several times in Kerra, unfortunately I was playing my erudite sk.  The spawns are happening for frequently  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greggery</div><div class="date">03-04-2000, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spawn times have definitely been dramatically reduced. Before the patch I was only able to do boots and mace. Now I have BP legs and the parts for the bracer (haven't actually gone o get it yet), plus Babbinsport glove piece. For example, Dwigus spawns every four hours, compared to pre-patch Bilge, who spawned maybe once a month per server. Maugarim spawns in 4 hours or less as well. Also, many of the quest mobs are already up when I look for them. Maugarim (2nd time, legs PKed from me) and Babbinsport were both up when I checked for them. Red skelly took about 20 min when I helped a friend, compared to 3 hours pre-patch for myself.</div></div><hr />
