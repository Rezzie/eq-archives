There is an orc camp that is right next to a paly camp on a hill.  If you accidentally pull too many orcs (stupid lull fails too much!), just run to the paladins and they will save you.<br />
<br />
Great loot too..the orcs usually have leather/raw-hide armor and sometimes bronze weapons. The lizardmen that wander up there sometimes carry bronze weapons, too.<br />
<br />
Main problem I had was with encumbrance.  The closest bank is either Qeynos or Highkeep, and I would make a trip to either of these places after I got a buffer on the next level.  By the time I got to the bank, I usually had about 20-30pp in change on me (20+lbs of loot!).<br />
<br />
May Tunare bless you in your travels!<br />
