but died rather quickly on the 3rd try.  He dropped 6 tears (forgot all of which).   Cheers to the Bristlebane dragonkin!<br />

Any info you wish to share with us?<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to know where he stands in relation to the other dragons in difficulty. Worse than Hoshkar? Phara Dar? Sontalak? Yelinak? Easier than Statue? Vindicator?<br />
<br />
Any resists?<br />

I have tried him 2 times on Tunare. Failed very bad on both. I would say way harder than Statue. Similar or harder than Sontalak, I think. <br />
Hits for 500s or so, I think, not too sure. But the worse thing about him is the AE. It seems quite hard to resist. 400 dmg with dispell for 1 buff. And Dozekar's hp is pretty high.<br />
Some instant click buff items is needed for that dispell, I think. Any other special tactice that you used for him? It is hard to keep main tanks and all groupmate healed from AE.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />

  Well, he's a velius type mob so way more hp's then hoskar and phara dar, so I'd say harder even though his AE doesn't do as much damage as hoskar you get hit with it far mor often.  I haven't killed yelinak or sontalak (seeing as how I'm +dragon) but I'd say he's harder then Zlandicar for sure.  We believe his AE to be unresistable so focused on hp/ac gear for tanks and hp/mana gear for casters.  His AE does dispell 1 buff as was mentioned and does 400 damage.  Hits for 700ish on a non-defensive warrior (or other squishy type person) and I think around 400ish if in defensive or something like that.  Only killed the Vindicator once and it seemed to be a much different fight so hard to judge.  I believe caster types were saying that fire hit him, but can't be 100% sure on that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaldiana D'Ozz</div><div class="date">06-21-2001, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Dalain in regards to Doz vs Hoshkar, PD and Zlan.<br />
<br />
As for vs some of the other Velious mobs...<br />
<br />
Doz has his 400 dmg single dispell AE and similar hitpoints to Sontalak, but Sont's AE is much more fierce (650ish dmg, and AE pillage *waves goodbye to 4 buffs at once*).  Plus, Doz is a rooted mob where Sont isn't.  So I'd have to say that Sont is harder then Doz in a direct comparison. <br />
<br />
Doz is probably a closer comparison fight wise to Yelinak...both being rooted mobs with tons o' hitpoints.  Yelinak's mana drain dot is of course his biggest sticking point but with no dispell and about the same DD, but melee wise I'd say these are about the same.  But by virtue of that darn mana drain alone, I still have to give Yel a slight edge on being harder.  Or at least I'd say that Yel takes a bit more coordination on the part of casters.<br />
<br />
It's really almost impossible to compare Doz to Vindi/Statue/Tormax/Dain though.  Since those are pure melee fights with highly mobile mobs that bring friends along for the ride...makes them very different encounters.<br />
<br />
