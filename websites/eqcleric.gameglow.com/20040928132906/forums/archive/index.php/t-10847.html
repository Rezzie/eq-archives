<br />
We did this quest last night (for me!) and we set up shop on the shoreline directly to the LEFT of the tunnel to SG. (As you exit tunnel from SG to WW, turn left, go to water.)<br />
<br />
We had no wanderers, no dragons, no problems with staying there.<br />
<br />
The giants were easily pulled from further down the shore, and the captain was tagged off the train while our expert kiter took the rest of the giants on a lovely tour of the western wastes.<br />
<br />
The only problem we had at all was this (and boy, did this stink) Scout Charisa sees through invis at a roughly 100% chance. (I think this was done to prevent any possible faction exploits? I seem to recall a rogue telling me he couldn't sneak/hide this quest.)<br />
<br />
Anyways, the Scout spawns RIGHT on top of the tunnel as you enter WW. If you have -COV people, they will can get aggroed in the tunnel and then you will be royally screwed, as Charisa will camp the zone and seems to have NO ability to reset properly. I sat there and stared at her for 10 minutes, she didn't move. Finally we had to get a shaman to train her away so the rest of my friends (who are -COV) could zone in.<br />
<br />
This quest is insanely easy for the reward and I encourage every +COV person to do it.<br />
<br />
Just make sure your -COV friends don't get killed!<br />

We set up on a hill overlooking the shore (didn't think about it too much).  A Druid Harmonied the Captain and got him and 3-4 Warriors.  I tried to pick the Captain of the train and didn't do a good job of it; I became the kiter.  <br />
<br />
SoW wore off during my kite and JBoots &lt; Captain's foot speed.  I was rapidly going down so I feigned.  Poof goes the Captain and his friends.<br />
<br />
I was thinking that we should just fight what we get (3-4 Warriors on top of the Captain wouldn't be easy, but probably doable with Slow).  But, apparently kite is the way to go?<br />
<br />
Was the Captain slowable?  I'm not counting on it, but makes it cake if he is.<br />

<br />
We had a 60 Shaman with us, and I can't recall if he was slowable. I'll check back with him and post.<br />
<br />
I do specifically remembering our wizards saying that Sunstrike and just about any other spell they wanted to land did fine.<br />

<br />
Also, get a patient ranger/druid to do the pull. When I got my Talisman last night our ranger (level 55) single pulled the Cpt - and is 2/2 doing that. <br />

This same quest has three rewards, one for casters, one for melee and one for priests.<br />
<br />
You can read about the quest  here. (http://www.gameznet.com/eq/quest/skyshrine/tooldelivery.html)<br />
<br />
The Priestly reward is this item which is the best range slot item around:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazrin Wraithforge</div><div class="date">05-21-2001, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow thanks Alliliel. I might just have to do<br />
this quest someday but I think first I gotta work on my faction.  Do you have to have Ally faction to complete this quest?<br />
I also see the item rewards are sequential you get the robe hand it back then get the Bracer hand that back and get the Talisman.<br />
Question though looking at the stats of the Robe why would any caster actually do it -8 dex -8 agi ain't crash hot although the AC and the Mana are nice I am just curious are any casters actually doing this quest for the Reward.<br />
I can see why Shamans, Clerics, Druids, and Melee's would do this quest.<br />

<br />
Yes, you must be an ally to the Claws Of Veeshan for this quest. Considering how easy the quest is, the only hard parts are the faction (which is EASY to get if you have't taken too many -COV hits) and the quest can only be done once every 20 RL hours.<br />
<br />
That's a supremely nice robe for enchanters, btw.<br />
<br />
Dex is worthless for a caster. (At one time we thought it helped with channeling, but this was disproven.) And no caster is going to get their AC to a point where some AGI loss is going to matter.<br />

<br />
I play an enchanter. I wouldn't consider wearing this robe over either the insidious robe (hate planar armor) or a bonecasters robe. Actually, I would seek out a green silken drape before this robe.<br />
<br />
Int is not a factor, considering many of the sought after robes have an ample supply of int. Cha? With good gear and maybe a few points in the starting stats 200 cha can easily be obtained, though telling the difference between 170 and 200 will be very difficult. So you get some cha and maybe a point or two of ac. And then you lose dex? No resists? If you find that your enchanter is getting beat on every fight, the enchanter isn't doing it right. If you find that a couple or even 10, or even 50 ac is saving your enchanters life, then I am truely impressed.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with the robe is that the other possible quest items are amazing. To waste a 20hr spawn on the robe when you could a bracer or the ranged item is truely a shame. The robe is not supremely nice for enchanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">05-21-2001, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't pretend to know the stats of enchanter gear, but as far as this item goes, I can tell you that a couple of casters I know have been hot to get it. All of them Enchanters.<br />
<br />
What does strike me as a little odd tho, is that the robe is not as good as the priest/melee rewards, imo.<br />

Nah, just that casters are by far less dependent on their equipment than melee's, or to an extent even priests.<br />
<br />
Once a caster reaches 200 Int (a joke these days) then it's all resists or hit points.  What casters really need in this game are neat items that either cast a USEFUL spell (er, not something they quit tossing 20+ levels ago) or something that makes them BETTER at casting (e.g. a Channeling rod, more Flowing Thought items, etc).  Frankly, I'd love a Channeling rod too =).<br />

It's very good, but surely Brain of Cazic Thule is better? Not that it matters to me, I'm so deep into scowling with CoV it would take me a month of killing giants to get to ally...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, we've killed new Cazic about 6-8 times, maybe? We've never seen a brain or ANY caster loot from him with the exception of the Cleric Halo.<br />
