 Yous gonna be needing a full rolling dwarven brigade, lemme tell you.<br />
 Yous can bring a ranger fer dah tracking, but mostly so he can call out dah rares dat pop in dah zone so as to distract dah dr00ds away from your elusive prey.<br />
 What yous needs fer dis her hunt is to be well prepared. <br />
 I will list dah teams needed and gear required...<br />
<br />
 4 Teams of Rollers.<br />
 2 Teams of Stoppers. (or is it the other way around&gt;? Bah if your two teams os stoppers be flattened rez and try again)<br />
 1 team of Tappers.<br />
 1 team of Muggers.(des here fill mugs and pass em out to the others...best to rotate dah dwarves here so none gets too tempted and thirsty and dives into the Uber Keg)<br />
 Teams consist of 4-5 Dwarves lead by a Dwarven Brewing-Engineer.<br />
 If'n ye discover an Uber Keg in let's say an Icy region, be sure to bring along a Coldain Consultant or a Barbarian or two to best discuss Slippage, friction coefficients and such snow bound topics)<br />
 WHile dah ranger is out and distracting others in the zone you're hunting in, he can do some hunting, me finds dat rabbit and fowl goes best wif dah Uber Keg o'Lager. And dat Bear and Mammoth Goes best wif dah Uber Stouts Kegs.<br />
 One Dwarf will be named Cook master and another Mug Master. <br />
 Dah Cook Master is required to bring at least two spits or a portable gnomish BBQ Pit...though use that at your own risk. He should be well versed in Fire resist magics and be wearing his best fire gear too.<br />
 Dah Mug Master is in charge of passing out and inspecting personal mugs. A Dirty Mug can contaminate dah Uber Keg once it is subdued properly. If a Dwarf Refuses to wash his mug out properly he will be relageated to drinking the keg dregs after everyone else is in a comfortable coma.<br />
<br />
 Gear Required.<br />
   Everyone needs, good padded armor, at least two sturdy and clean mugs, der personal and favorite weapons to deal with party crashers. Bandages, cause casting is a bit unrealiable after the Keg is subdued and tapped. Burn ointment in case you decide you are as good a cook as the Cook Master, and decide you can prove it too. Healing-root potions be good too so you can hold your place in line with out wobbling. A blanket and a pillow so you can sleep where you fall when you cannot stand any longer.<br />
 Additionally, the pusher-rollers need heavy staves to help guide dah Uber keg to the prepared killing zone, and ropes with anchor hooks to prevent themselves from being dragged willy nilly and crushed if they get snagged on a splinter and being yanked up and over and under... should a rope snap, prepare to res.<br />
 Stoppers be needing the best plate armor, and biggest staves and rods dey can get their hands on, as well as good serviceable boots, boot spikes for extra traction are optional and only N00bs resort to their use.<br />
 Many Uber Keggers have purposely trained the Wild Uber Kegs while sowed (thanks to guest ranger) to a carefully prepared pit and secured the keg with no losses and doing little to upset the keg's contents.<br />
 N00bs will also prematurely tap the uber keg before it has settled down properly from being hunted and herded for to the killing grounds. THese n00bs are usually found hanging in nearby trees or burined in mountain sides far far from the original hunting grounds. The real unlucky ones will be nothing more than a red beer smelling mist that wafts away with the prevailing winds.<br />
<br />
 Next chapter will be on tracking the elusive UBER KEGS. THe ORIGINS of the UBER KEGS. And finally on 1001 uses for the UBER KEG after the hunt is over.<br />

<br />

I was honored to be a stopper. I was wearin my great-grandpa's specially made stopper suit, and my pop's fine steel super-stave. 'Twas twice as thick and heavy as a normal one, and he had ta show me how to brace it so I wouldn't fall over. When that keg came a bouncin and rollin in, it seemed to grow with every inch it traveled. A chance unseen rock drove the keg wild, and it came roarin and rollin straight for me. I'm not ashamed to admit my muscles froze in terror, for this very act saved me. I locked onto that stave so hard, the keg bounced off it and twas stunned for a sec. The other stoppers swarmed it, and the first few ropes brought me back to my senses and I egaerly helped tie down and subdue the beasty. 'Twas a good malt lager, took almost an hour for it to settle enough to tap.<br />

Ah, memories......<br />

 200 years since we last found one, and it was kiting a Keg of Dalur Stout about the plains of Karana.<br />
 Yes we corralled and tapped both. But that lil keg bruised the lot of us...lemme tell ye.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brodder</div><div class="date">01-30-2004, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with new expansions it's come to the Brewing Association of Kaladim's attention that new breeds of wild kegs have been spotted herding in and about the moon...<br />
<br />
 AH fear the repercussions of a stampede of wild kegs of our more potent brews taking a cliff dive deep into the bowels of Luclin...if the herd of wild kegs were large enough...the moon might just be destroyed!<br />
<br />
:D <br />
 Report any new sightings and methods of keg corralling, and branding techniques...</div></div><hr />
