<br />
I'm one of those unfortunate types that can't seem to play EQ at a regular time interval; I have to sneak it in whenever I have time and the wife will allow me, which means some late weekends, and sporadic weeknights.  This all means that I can never settle into a group.  I'm always forced to shout for groups.  When I do find a good group, everyone is highly complimentary of my work as a cleric, and we typically do well as far as XP and loot.<br />
<br />
But the last level or two (I just made 16 last night... soloing on the Chessboard in BB), I have found it increasingly harder to get ANYONE to join, much less a GOOD group.  I've tried Unrest, Crushbone, Ro/Oasis, Minotaur caves in Steamfont... the only people I seem to be able to attract are the KeWl d00dz and closet killstealers.<br />
<br />
I've tried soloing, but anything that gives a noticeable amount of XP is either ridiculously hard for a blue, or surrounded by lots of nasty, dangerous stuff.  Like the yard trash in Unrest... I got almost to 16 the other night fighting bugs, then got trained on, and died SIX times getting trained on trying to get my corpse back.  I left with a net loss of over a bubble of experience, and I had been up by nearly 2 bubbles before I died the first time.  Losing 3 bubbles of XP trying to get my corpse is not my idea of productivity.  I was the lowest level player there at 15, and absolutely NO ONE was interested in grouping with me.<br />
<br />
Why is it that it seems clerics have a special difficulty in this area?  I think it's mainly a combination of the same old rant topics, that at this level, druids and shamans have the same healing capabilities with lots of more useful utility and buff spells.  When the cleric really needs to group most, he's displaced by a hybrid class.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if anyone has ideas for a grudgingly solo cleric, let me know.<br />
