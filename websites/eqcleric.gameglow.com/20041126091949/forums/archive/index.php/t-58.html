<br />
I'm friggin pissed right now. I stayed at the keyboard for over 5 hours last night just waiting for my petition to be answered. After it was Escalated 2x and I waited for the head GM to login, I finally got an answer: Email me about this. I have to investigate this in my off-server time.<br />
<br />
I really can't believe it. This is probably the one thing that could make me leave the game.<br />
<br />
To those of you on Bristlebane, if you never see a grumpy, ale drinking dwarf named Meddik running around, this is why.<br />

Freaked me out the first time it happened to me. I think all i did was accidently pick another server (even though yours is always highlighted now). <br />
<br />
If that fails contact customer support immediately so they can get the process of restoring your character from last back up.</div></div><hr />

I'm about to go crazy with this one....<br />

<br />
Sorry to hear that man.  That would worry me also after having logged out and in a couple times and find my characters missing.<br />
<br />
Definitely give the tech support people a call.<br />

I certainly wish the best of luck to you hon in dealing with the GMs!  <br />
<br />
But if for some god forsaken reason they can't help, my bank account and powerleveling abilities are all yours for the asking.<br />

You have always been one of the clerics on our server that I have looked up to (Us dwarves are short...)<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild has offerred to powerlevel me up, at least into the 20s or so if I do create a new character. (Since the guild split, most of my guild is in the 20s themselves.) <br />
<br />
Hopefully, that will not be needed and verant will take care of this faster than they fixed the AC on the cleric armour.<br />

A guildmate had this happen to him.  It took 2 or 3 weeks to get his characters back  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif.<br />

I have, and will do again, the majority of our quest armor quests for you if this is the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It happened to me once, but all I had to do was exit back to choosing the server screen, scroll down so I actually saw my server was highlighted, clicked on it again to make sure it was the right server, and everything was fine. Now if my server isn't on the viewable top half of the list, I scroll down to make sure I see it highlighted. I hope they resolve your situation quickly.<br />

I appreciate the offer, but I really hope that will not be neccesary. After all, I was to lazy to do most of the armour quests myself...It would be kinda silly for you to spend your time doing them for me!<br />

<br />
What you need to do is make sure you petition when the GM (not a guide) is on. Tell him/her what happened...he/she will ask you the names of all of your characters and you should be able to get them restored!<br />
<br />
It took me two weeks to catch the GM on my server  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />
