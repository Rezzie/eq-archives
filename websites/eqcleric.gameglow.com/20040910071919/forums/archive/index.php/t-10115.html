<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">11-30-1999, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My shopping list:<br />
<br />
Runed Circlet or Nightshade wreath<br />
Mammoth Cloak<br />
Charred Guardian Shield<br />
Any of the Cleric Armor Pieces but the boots<br />
<br />
I have a few small items to trade such as SBS, Screaming Mace, BS Mantle, Jagged Bands, and one really, really big one, Dwarven Work Boots.<br />
<br />
Note that I would not trade any common-drop item, even if superior, for the work boots. Reason is that the work boots are just SO damn hard to get sometimes. (The ghost or his placeholder spawns every 20 min, but sometimes the ghost has missed 5 spawns in a row, hags appeared instead, and even when he does appear, the boots are a RARE drop.)<br />
<br />
So I would not trade a CGS for D Work Boots, unless something else was thrown in to sweeten the pot a little.<br />
<br />
Of course, I have some cold hard cash, if youd rather sell me some stuff, too!<br />
<br />
