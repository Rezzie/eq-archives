I had an absolute blast there last night, and one of the hardest and longest fights I've ever been in.<br />
<br />
Right before the fire giants there is a room with a spider design on the wall.  It looks like it's a lava painting, for lack of a better term, and their are several bodies encased in silk (victims of the bugs).  Just around the right corner (when facing the lava painting) from this room spawns the stone spider, one the left is where the noxious spider spawns.  In the room there are 3 LDCs that spawn and there are 2 wanderers that can come to the entrance of the room (if you are not fighting they generally will not come in unless you are close to the entry).<br />
<br />
Now the group consisted of a 44 ranger (Kolen), a 44 warrior (Banzeye), a 50 Mage (Nim.- I can't remember his full name), a 50 enchanter (Goldius), a 50 cleric (Massieus), and a 49 cleric (me).<br />
<br />
We'd fought to this room and killed the stone spider twice, the nox once, about 7 LDCs and about 4 laval beetles.  Things were going great with an enchanter and 2 clerics.  In fact we are pulling so fast I have to memorize Extinguish Fatigue (kinda like being back in Kedge heheh)<br />
<br />
We are all between 50% to 70% mana when the nox spawns.  We jump him and start whack'n away, but low and behold a wanderer coming to join, no biggy.  Opps, there's the other wanderer (a lava beetle this time) and now the fight is 3.  Enchanter charms the LDC and sicks it on the nox.  The enchanter is a blur running all over the room messing, slowing, etc.  The clerics are casting complete heals on the tanks, everything is fine.  The Mage's pet dies (darn those earth ele pets have TONS of hp!), so he makes another and is getting low on mana- as is the enchanter.<br />
<br />
When the nox is 1/4 life, the LDC breaks charm and as it hits Goldius I stun it once and it dies.  Just as this happens, the room starts to spawn.  3 more LDCs join the fight.  Both clerics are &quot;almost&quot; chain casting complete heal on the tanks at this point, the nox dies.  Both tanks are poisoned and have boiling blood on them (ouchies), the enchanter is almost OOM but she manages to charm on LDC.  The other cleric goes OOM, I stone down to 2 bubs of life and cast back to back complete heals on both our tanks (barely making the last one).  This puts me totally out of mana.<br />
<br />
As I sit down to med I start thinging of the corpse recovery process and think, my GOD this is a great fight.  The Mage's pet dies again.  We start saying &quot;Don't loot the corpses, I've got to get a screen shot of this.&quot;,  quickly responded to with, &quot;Ya, if we live.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone is taking some damage at this point, then mage and enchanter are about 1/2 health, the other cleric got jumped so he couldn't use his manastone and is about 1/2 health.  The tanks are getting to about 1/2 health when the other cleric says, &quot;Enought for CH&quot;.  About 20 seconds later I say &quot;me too&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just after I said this, the first wanderer spawns and comes in to join the fight- this time a lava beetle. And it brings one from the other room.  With a little mana the mage casts another pet and lets the pet tank one after the Enchanter charms one of the LDCs and sicks it on the remaining untargeted LDC. <br />
We all sit to med while the ranger and warrior are trying to not get hit.  The ranger starts healing himself and then jumps back into the fight.  The last ones went down pretty easy after this.<br />
<br />
All in all to toll was: 7 LDCs, 3 Lava Beetles, 1 Sonic bat (I know I didn't mention it, I forget where in the battle he came in), and one Noxious Spider.  The battle took so long that the room was just about ready to spawn again.  That night we killed 2 Noxious and 2 Stone spiders.  2 BCPs and 2 Drapes, a bunch of silk and tons of research stuff (only one that anyone could use), and both the tanks got to 45.  After the above fight, my experience bar moved almost a half bubble.<br />
<br />
Even though we thought we were toast, no one panaiced, and no one died.  I know a druid or 2 that would REALLY wants this BCP I won in the random.  I just have to decide if I wan't to make a friend for life, or trade this thing for some stuff I want  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  I can finally get that Paw &lt;grins evilly&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDC's at the same time as Nox?!<br />
<br />
I had to CH a lvl 50 warrior 3 times while fighting only Nox...hehe, and we still had 2 lvl 40's whacking away, and a lvl 38 wiz and 40 shaman nuking it.<br />
<br />
Definitely WTG!<br />
<br />
Did ya get any screenshots? I'd love to see the battlefield  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
We fought down to Stone spider last night with 2 groups, and had quite a rough time keeping everyone alive even though we had 3 Clerics.<br />
<br />
We got him twice...first time he dropped the BCP...and the other his oh so wonderful rare drop...the crystalline orb!!<br />
<br />
YES! 5 Charges of Eye of Zomm!! What more can you ask from a lvl 44ish mob?<br />
<br />
Owell, maybe we can sell it at the bazaar for 5 pp to some lowb and buy us some brandy or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lava beetles are great xp, LDC's have too much HP to be considered good xp, unless you have some heavy nuking power in there...<br />
<br />
(I nuked one for 501, possibly 1/10th of its hp, if even that...i'd guesstimate they have around 5-7k HP)<br />
<br />
Oh well...less than 2 bubs to get outta 45...yay!  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
It was the most insane battle I've ever had, where no one died.  The only thing that I've seen come close is when 3 Amy Knights Charged from an almost empty Fear plan (just the knights, one of the Amy Lords, the Draco and Cazic left) to come right at ME.  I died in about 5 seconds, then my whole party died, then the 2 other groups fell with a total of 5 people gating before everyone died.  Corpse recovery on that was was tough because the zone had started to respawn, but we got everyone out.  &lt;end ramble&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalyope</div><div class="date">11-22-1999, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My good friend Zentelfin invite me to visit that stone spider yesterday as well.  I have to admit it was incredible.  I'm only a 45th level cleric on Tarew Marr, and I was also priviledged to have Masseius at my side.  I don't think I've ever fought with a better cleric in my life.  He is truly worthy of my respect.  I learned SO much in the brief time I was there.  <br />
<br />
My hat also goes off to Annalisa.  I've never had the privildge to fight with her before, but I was awestruck.  That little gnome could fly.  I'm afraid I was a bit mesmerized myself.  I hope to join Anna again on many more occasions.<br />
<br />
I have found that my own role in a battle has changed somewhat over the last 10-15 levels, but the battles we fought with the stone spider were the first I'd actually used complete heal-tis definitely a shock.  I have to agree it put a little life back into the game for me tho, not to mention we did walk away with a brown chitin protector for my wonderful husband Qynn.  <br />
<br />
Oh, on a side note, with several pl spikes in the zone, we decided the the stone spidey was just much to risky, some of us formed other groups and spent some time with the priest and champion.  After a long night of camping, and other groups leaving because of a lack of named mobs spawning, things finally began to pop around 1:00 a.m.  I, myself, now have a new mithril breastplate, as does my new friend Bobbinus. I think two pauldrons were dropped as well.  And I don't remember the number of shields we left with...not that anyone wanted them, but I think each of the six of us has one now.  Twas truly Christmas in Norrath yesterday for us all.<br />
<br />
Still even with the drops that had been so desired, I honestly think the greatest gifts I received were 1) new friends, and 2) new challenges to share.  Thanks again Zente, for letting me tag along!!<br />

I play on Tarew Marr too.  I've seen ya around quite a bit.  Mass is a great cleric.  He didn't get anything in POH this weekend either (that makes me 0 for 12 on drops so far, but they'll come eventually).  I think you guys were getting lag with that GM event, same as we were in POH (Masseius came later).  Zentelftin is a great guy.  Congrats on your new BP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanaz</div><div class="date">11-24-1999, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do you deal with those nasty dots?  As a cleric I guess we can just heal, or is Nullify magic useful?  I also try stun them as much as possible but not sure if they worth my mana.<br />
<br />
And what the other class can do? Last time I group with a bard, looks she got a &lt;cleanse song&gt; that can cure dot at once.  Not sure if it take over my buff too but I even don't need to buff up resist.</div></div><hr />

I have heard that the spell regenerate does cancel the boiling blood spell, but I have not had any real chance verifying this. ( I try to avoid getting DOTed myself... )<br />

Heh, an incedent where 2 groups of use delt with 5 imp protectors at once come to mind, but thats another story. =)<br />
<br />
Nanaz, egads no, its much cheeper just to heal the tank than to risk canceling the 1000+ mana in buffs on them. If you have a druid around they can pop a pack cloroplast and it cancels the blood boil on everyone.<br />

I just normaly wait for the dot to be over before I heal the person full up.  Keep them alive of course but keep in mind their life will continue to drop.  If regen is on and THEN the person gets BB you are just out of luck till one of them goes away, then regen can be cast again.<br />
