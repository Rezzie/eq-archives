<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">07-03-2000, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After performing a wedding ceremony last Friday night, we went to the Arena for team PVP fun. I have to tell you, it was a blast and I learned a lot. Here are some of my observations-<br />
<br />
Resists and then AC are the way to go. Wis junkies were snacks for people 5 levels lower than them. Wis junkies also make good practice dummies for rogue backstab.<br />
<br />
The Prismatic Shield is simply an AWESOME pvp item. AC 18, plus 10 to all resists.<br />
<br />
Remember to do your buffs in dragon order, start with useless buffs, guise, resist disease, etc... (This is for team pvp, duels I recommend a different tactic, depending... see footnote 1)<br />
<br />
Have TONS of Pumice stones and Potions of all types. Here is how to smack around druids and get immense satisfaction from it--- Don’t buff yourself at all, go high resist and AC with gear. Duel starts, pumice stone druid, take away SOW, SLN, etc... Druid dots you, pumice yourself. Equip high damage melee item, (rename Caduceus of Sacrament the Druidsmacker)  beat druid senseless. They damage shield themselves and try to porcupine you, pumice them again. If the druid doesn’t have pumice stones, you can really rock their planet by you using a sow potion and a Damage shield potion (shamen are your friends) and kiting the druid around. You have vastly superior AC to a druid and more hps. Use it. If they try to starfire you, heal yourself, if you have remedy, your heals are more efficient than their DD. Starfire and Sup heal have identical dam/heal vs mana ratios. Plus you will get occasional Specialization bonuses for heals, and druids aren’t usually specialized in Evocation. Also, clerics have an easier time having higher wis, so the scales are really tipped in your favor.<br />
<br />
In pvp, Yaulp is it! Its not a pre-fight buff so its not really dispelled. Nice AC bonus and short casting time make it great. Case in point- Loevon, 55 Paladin with an Fiery Avenger and Uriah, lvl 60 Ranger, were unable to kill me in the arena. I was way in the back, they dispelled me and tried to instakill me, but with my superior gear-based resists and Yaulp AC bonus, and DA, I was happy to let them pound on me for a while my team assassinated them for big damage.<br />
<br />
Unless someone lands resist debuffs on your targets, forget any stuns but the lvl 5 one.<br />
<br />
Forget any idea of a stand-up fight, sneaky is cool!<br />
<br />
Paladin trying to tank you to death? Pumice him to zero buffs, take an invis potion and go med. (pumice to prevent see invis) Also don’t forget the ever useful Damage Shield potions.<br />
<br />
Generally, in PVP, charged items are ok, but infinitely activate-able items are bogus. (You cannot win a duel with someone that will use the Donal’s Helmet, they have infinite free heals, and stuns are resisted 90% of the time.)<br />
<br />
Casters are really lame. But don’t let chanters mana tap you or land a Dazzle on you. Fear the pets so far away they suicide. Dread of Night makes Necro pets flee for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Footnote one- For classes where you have superior melee, like druids, also pure casters, don’t even buff yourself. Pumice all their buffs off and let your natural advantages come to the fore. You might try to keep resists up if you can, if they don’t try to dispell you or pumice you.<br />
<br />
Now this is just what I've learned over the weekend, I'm sure our friends on the Zeks are more practiced at PVP, but it's really a different kind of PVP, since jokers are constantly after you. These are more observations for the blue server PVP, where you know you are about to engage someone.<br />
