<br />
I had to do a CR in Kaesora the other night.<br />
<br />
Ok, cool and all.  I go in, and these spiders that are supposed to be on the Venril Sathir faction con ready to attack me.  In fact, everything in the dungeon cons ready to attack me.  Now, I've turned in a lot of berserker war braids, and I'm at amiable.  During the course of the CR one of the things aggros me, my party kills it, I take a faction hit, no big deal one, one faction hit in the course of the CR and I get back to the Overthere and I'm still amiable so I'm ok with this.<br />
<br />
What pisses me off is if these things are pal s with Venril Sathir and I've got amiable faction with Venril Sathir why can't I set foot in this dungeon without them attacking me and forcing me to flee or mess up my faction?  Just doesn't make sense to me.<br />

<br />
A barbarian shaman friend and I went down looking for a few specific items the other day. He and his pet had to do most of the work and I was constantly clicking the Atone button whenever it came up. We were down there quite and while and I did manage to come out without losing a faction level, but it's a real pain the arse. Never did get the items we were looking for either.  <br />
<br />
My feeling on this subject is - If they're going to make it so blasted difficult for the evil races to hunt in these places, at LEAST make the effort to do so worth it! I came out with a Tombcarver, (rogue weapon), and that's it. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I took about 10 faction hits give or take a couple and still maintained my amiable status with the Overthere outpost if that helps any.<br />

I've been doing a lot of work in the Overthere, used the Sarnaks to break through 47, 48, and into 49 (god I LOVE the xp off those war braids) so I'm up to warmly now.<br />
<br />
I have no intention of screwing that up, so I won't be going back to Kaesora unless they put some sort of a fix in.  I understand that Karnor's is the same (I don't know, will I get attacked in there just like I did in Kaesora, I mean it is Venril's dungeon isn't it?).<br />
<br />
I have heard that there is a third dungeon in Kunark where we can't hunt because of this faction thing.  Does anyone know what it is?<br />
<br />
What I'd like to see is two or three of the other Kunark dungeons &quot;darked&quot; by making the white races take Firiona hits for hunting there.  That would at least make it somewhat fair.  We have to rely on them to get us things out of the dungeons we can't go into without burning our only Kunark bridge?  What do they have to rely on us for?  Where is the vaunted gamed balance in that?<br />
