A couple notes on the group heals:<br />
<br />
49 Word of Healing (http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=779): 4sec 600 mana for 500 hp = 1.20 mana per hp, 125 hp/sec<br />
52 Heroic Bond (http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=785): 3.5sec 420 mana for 400 hp = 1.05 mana per hp, 114 hp/sec<br />
52 Word of Vigor (http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=783): 4.25sec 750 mana for 620 hp = 1.21 mana per hp, 146 hp/sec<br />
57 Word of Restoration (http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spell.asp?Id=802): 4.5sec 900 mana for 750 hp = 1.20 mana per hp, 167 hp/sec<br />
<br />
- Word of Healing, Vigor and Restoration have the same mana/hp.<br />
- hp/sec: In an AE situation where you are chain-casting group heals (which shouldn't be often if your group has good resists), and you don't have time for Word of Redemption (or can't cast it like me :P), Word of Restoration provides the biggest bang for the buck.  If you're forced to chain cast the group heal then it's probably because the group is dropping faster than you can heal them.  hp/sec is a huge consideration.<br />
<br />
At 58, I use Word of Healing and Word of Restoration for group heals on ae targets.  I tend to use WoR as my staple group heal.  It gives me a more leisurely pace to keep everyone alive.  I can spot heal those falling faster than the rest in between.  Also, because of its higher mana cost, if specialization kicks in I'm saving more mana.  Word of Healing I keep up for when my mana starts to thin and my goal is to keep as many in the group alive as possible, not necessarily healthy.<br />
<br />
Far too often groupmates at raids (especially VP) get Aegolism or get swapped in from a group with a higher level cleric and heroic bond won't stick on at least one person.  With specialization and the hp/sec I don't feel too guilty tossing some extra mana for a 100hp boost in a group heal.  But yeah in an idea situation heroic bond is an incredible group heal.<br />
<br />
But every cleric heals differently.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, we've killed all the dragons in VP as well and the dragon that has caused us the most problems has been Druushk.  Our Druushk fights we win almost seem like luck, as in if the casters and light tanks can resist the massive AE, but if they don't we pretty much get waxed.  What do you have people run their MR at for Druushk?  About every other dragon we've killed with adds too (ok never had an add with silverwing).  *shrug* But Druushk solo has probably killed us now as often as Hoskar.  But, Xylgoz, Silverwing, and Nexona were pretty wimpy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have MANY high level warriors in various Kael armors with cobalt, and lots of monks and rogues, all very well equipped.<br />
<br />
I bet the caster heavy guilds find Hoshkar weak and Phara Dar awful, where we had just the reverse.<br />

Athough these haven't been guild events really.  Just a collection of many high lvl players from alot of different guilds that all sort of grew up together on the server at the same time.  We have been very light on heavy tanks (ie warriors...last raid we didn't even have 1 60th lvl warrior with us, just a 58th lvl 1 I think...probably most we had was 3 60th lvl warriors one raid).  But yeah, aside from mistakes on Hoskar, the biggest pain in the butt dragon on my 4 or 5 VP trips has been Druushk.</div></div><hr />
