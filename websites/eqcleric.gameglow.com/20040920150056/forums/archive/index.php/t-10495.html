On lvl 19 he might be hard wo a group (of 4?), but with only 3 mins downtime, you feel like being a newbie again...<br />
<br />
..one has time to chat and be social on this picnic. Hermit is in SK, Eastward from Aviak city, and you need pull it out per AE spell.<br />
<br />
The place is harvested heavily by those eBay char sellers tho nowadays, as its easiest lift fm 20 to 28 around Norrath eheh<br />
<br />
As dark elf, I may kill druids that are hostile to me, or?</div></div><hr />

<br />
when you only get 1 of every 3 or 4, that is too crowded for me.<br />

When I was level 21, I was able to solo 1 and then the next one killed me.  I'm going to try again at 22. (and I was full mana and health with spirit armor and daring).<br />
<br />
Maybe its my armor?  But I have decent armor, most bronze and some +wis jewelry.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roechek</div><div class="date">01-13-2000, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I paid a visit to the hermit last night. There were two gnomes there camping him. One of them told me, before I could even say hi, &quot;We're camping here.&quot; The other said &quot;I will kill you.&quot; <br />
<br />
I thought this was rude of them, but I replied that I was simply exploring, and had no intention of KSing from them. I just wanted to look around.<br />
<br />
The other guy says again, &quot;I will kill you.&quot; Not being on a PvP server, I wasn't conerned, but I still thought it was rude. But then I see the hermit respond to this phrase. That's how to pull him out without an AE spell! <br />
<br />
I hadn't seen this information elsewhere, so I thought I'd pass it along. <br />
<br />
Oh, the one hermit I saw was blue to me. I ran up and swung my cold iron morning star and hit him a couple of time for 17+. He tried to hit me once and missed. He went down really fast.<br />
<br />
I plan to go back tonight and try to solo him. I'll report back here if anyone's interested. <br />

<br />
I've been solo'ing him fairly well since lvl 23.  I could barley keep up with the spawn at that level however and died once because of a few nasty resists and fizzes.<br />

Druid also could get inside the house, which really gave all the rest of the campers fits. Pretty damn boring, though. This is the low level equivalent of camping guards. That poor hermit never hurt anyone.<br />
