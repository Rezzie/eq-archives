<br />
Setup:  ToFS with mid-30's group (I'm 47)of guildies, including my husband playing his bard (why I was there).  Warrior has never pulled ToFS before.  I'm at FM.<br />
<br />
Situation:  Warrior pulls 5! mobs:  Necro and I root parking to save our lives, druid spam healing warrior, bard trying to mez.  Druid gets healing aggro, runs around, necro pet dies, necro gets aggro, bard's mezzes being resisted.  General chaos.  We dispatch two mobs, three to go.  Druid and Necro at 80 health.  Bard and Warrior both at 50 health and dropping. Me:  20m!  and everytime I sit down, mob C comes to beat on me!<br />
<br />
Ok, here's the choice:  CHeal the warrior, who can taunt Mob C off me?  Or celestial my husband, and hope I have enough to sup heal the Warrior.  Now, I know everyone will agree that the smart thing to do is to Cheal the warrior.  But you aren't married to the one you are letting die! *wink*  <br />
<br />
And yes, that was what I did.  I Chealed the warrior, let my husband die, sat down, Warrior Taunted Mob C off me, and was able to regain enough mana for 1 more superior heal, and everyone (except my husband) ended the fight at half health and OOM.  <br />
<br />
Any times like that where you knew what you *should* do, and didn't, or at least thought twice?  C'mon! Share!<br />

Group: Me, SA, and what turned out to be the TA.<br />
<br />
Pull came, MA died fast. SA took over. The other Warrior in my group was appointed TA in the frenzy of that moment. AoE mob, so both take damage. At one point, both are at 50% health, both dropping. I toss a Celestial on the SA, and proceed to CHeal the TA. Wrong choice. Mob goes on a flurry, whatever, doing lots of damage on SA in a short time.<br />
<br />
Detail: I know the TA in RL (friend), I don't know the SA other than ingame.<br />
<br />
Choice: interrupt CHeal on TA and heal SA instead? Or proceed, toss DL on SA after CHeal on TA, and then CHeal SA?<br />
<br />
I chose the latter. With 2 seconds to go on the CHeal on the SA, she died. TA took over, mob died.<br />
