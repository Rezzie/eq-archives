<br />
<br />
That damn Babbinsbort quest has put me in a foul mood. I have been killing that spot for days and no results yet. I have friends log in on my account to help during those times of sleep and work. Log in, BOOM - dead plague rat, log out. Log in, BOOM - dead giant rat, log out. Log in, BOOM - dead ghoul, log out. Is this Verant's idea of questing fun? The name EverQuest must derive from the fact that it takes forever to complete a quest.<br />
<br />
Know what the worst part is? I'll tell you. I show up one night and there are 3 people waiting there. 2 /con red players powerleveling a /con green while they wait on the spawn. Fine with me, whatever makes you happy. The cleric waiting for the quest is level 50. She has a few pieces of Ethereal Mist, some Rubi, and the prismatic shield. She says she wants the gloves because she is tired of wearing her blackened iron gloves and needs something new. She then says that she was here first and asks if I am going to try to KS it. That alone is enough to get me irate, but I try to play fair. It is just a game after all. I say no, she was here first. I don't even wait around to see what spawns, I just camp.<br />
<br />
7hrs later, I pop back in. After standing there for a bit, a anon /con blue druid walks in. Neither of us speak, after inspecting each other, we just stare at the floor. I send a tell to a real life friend and ask if I can out nuke a /con blue druid, or are there any tricks that I should know about. The friend says that I'll be able to take the kill.<br />
<br />
But guess what happens. The level 50 cleric from before pops in. Then a /con red necro shows up. Then a level 50 paladin in full rubi appears too. Did I mention another druid also dropped by? And this druid is red to me. I say that I was here first and ask if they are going to steal my kill. Mrs. Level 50 says that the little blue druid was here first, but wasn't in the room at the time that I logged in. Says that the druid gets the right to the kill.<br />
<br />
Luckily a plague rats pops and dies instantly. Then all these perfect strangers GG away (including the little blue druid). I try to do all this crap the right way. I see nothing wrong with twinks, the whole damn game is about having fun anyway. When I camp large bronze for my troll, if a group ever shows up and is trying to get some armor for a party member, I give way. I hang around, buff and heal them and offer to buy redundant pieces that are dropped (ie. &quot;This is the third damn large bronze helm we've got, sell one to the cleric.&quot;) The few times I have tried camping for the cleric vambraces, I advertise for low levels to come kill the birds for me. I'll buff and heal them and all they have to do is kill Aviaks.<br />
<br />
If I ever get to 50, I won't be running around doing these dinky little quests. I'd organize a PoH raiding party to get me some new gloves. Yadda Yadda.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunik</div><div class="date">11-19-1999, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have encounted a similar situation on our Server concerning the spawn in Befallen for Babbinsbort.  There are now 5 of us who show up every 7 hours 10 minutes for the spawn.  The first time we all showed up there was a lot of hostility and comments about Kill Stealing.  But now that we have been together for 5 days and still no spawn we have all agreed that we have earned the right to attempt the kill and in fact if one of us misses a spawn we try to keep the others informed on the time for the next camp.   It's gotten kind of funny actually a person may be camping Babbinsbort and think &quot;Hey I am all alone, I may have a chance at this&quot;  when all of a sudden a bunch of other players start appearing as we have the spawn timed, the person there may whine about being &quot;first&quot; when in reality they are not &quot;first&quot; and in fact some of us have camped the sucker for days.<br />
<br />
Do I like the Babbinsbort Spawn.  No, I think it blows.  In fact I have just about given up on getting the spawn and have decided to stop camping Befallen every 7 hours 10 minutes (side note the spawn has taken as long as 7 hours 20 min to appear).  We have yet to see the little Gnome since the servers were brought back online on Monday. I have a lot better things to do with my cleric then hang out in Befallen.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiel</div><div class="date">11-19-1999, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kunik, the attitude you demonstrated in your post is exactly what the poster was ranting about.  I have guildmates who have camped Befallen for hours waiting for that spawn, just to have some jerk come along and claim they've been &quot;camping it for days.&quot;  If you're off doing something else during those hours, you most certainly have not been camping the spawn.  I take every opportunity possible to anti-KS people who do this crap to lower level guild members, a task for which this bard and my wizardress companion are quite well equipped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kunik</div><div class="date">11-22-1999, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, what you are saying is that when I spent 5 hours waiting for the PH to spawn in Befallen after the servers came up and then I killed the PH that I would have to sit there for another 7 hours 10 min in order to have a &quot;right&quot; to take the kill?  <br />
<br />
Now, if this was a situation where the little gnome spawned every 7 hours 10 minutes I would agree that the first person there has the right to the kill, but this is NOT a normal spawn!  It took 5 days before Babbinsbort spawned.  (BTW I did not get the kill, Kimberley did) We are talking 17 spawns.  I showed up to every spawn (gee I love getting up at 3am to log into Befallen in order to kill a rat) and most times other clerics (30+) and even a Level 36 Paladin (36) were there to take out the gnome.<br />
<br />
Was it fun?  No.  Did the clerics that whined about KS'ing when we all appeared stop?  Sure did, in fact they also began showing up for the spawn.   <br />
<br />
Why don't you wait 7 hours for a spawn only to find a rat appear and then tell me you are going to wait there for 7 more hours.  I don't think so.  You would do the same thing.<br />
<br />
So, how do we correct this?<br />
<br />
1.  Either make the Gnome spawn each and every time.<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
2.  Make the spawn time random so that no one can time it at all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiel</div><div class="date">12-01-1999, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that is what I would expect.  It's called a line -- first come, first serve.  My university has a big game, and I know tickets go on sale on a specific day; do I show up right when the ticket booth opens and hop up to the front of the line?  Nope, you have to wait in line behind the people who have been in tents camping all night waiting for the tickets.<br />
<br />
Rationalizing it because of the length of the spawn time is just an excuse (although, I do agree that the spawn time is ridiculous).  And yes, I did a 20 hour camping spree for jboots among others, and that was after waiting in line for 4 hours for the previous group to get theirs.<br />
<br />
It's a sad day when someone rationalizes fair play because of the length of a spawn.  Guess that's just EQ bringing out the worst in us.<br />

<br />
I firmly believe in the &quot;line&quot; camping rule.  If I stroll up to a spot I have been wanting and it is empty, it becomes mine.  I sometimes do a /shout to see if someone is kiting the npc and that is the reason they aren't there.  As a non-see invisi cleric, I also check for invisi players there that I don't see.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with this stuff of, I WAS here and left to run to store, or I logged last night and am back now for MY spawn....you want a spawn...you CAMP it...this means sit your tuckus down and stay there..or have a friend help relieve you for breaks.<br />
<br />
I have had people run across my &quot;stump watch&quot; close to spawn time and say it was their spawn because they had been trying for days.  Even though, I had been sitting there non stop and without commercial interruption for 6 hours.<br />
<br />
No way...if you aren't there when I arrive, I get squatters rights.<br />
