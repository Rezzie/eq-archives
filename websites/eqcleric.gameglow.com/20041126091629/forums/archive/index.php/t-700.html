<br />
Wide-eyed the dwarf boy peered around the corner and began to shake uncontrollably with fear. <br />
<br />
A humongous towering being, ten times the boy's size, had noticed his movement in the shadows and was moving slowly toward the boy's hiding place behind the blazing fire pots.<br />
<br />
The boy's eyes widened and focused on a great steel blade of such immense proportions it blocked out the Butcher Block sun.<br />
<br />
He tried to breath, but no breath entered his lungs. <br />
<br />
He tried to move his legs but they were paralyzed by the totality of his very life force completely focused deep within his soul.<br />
<br />
The blade advanced closer.			<br />
<br />
Overcome by raw terror the boy's consciousness became focused and it erupted in a incoherent, childish, terrifying scream.<br />
<br />
With the boy's shriek came a rush of adrenaline. The boy moved fast. Faster than the wind. Faster than he had ever run before. And he entered into the comforting bowels of Kaladim leaving the unknown beast behind.<br />
<br />
********************<br />
Chapter 2<br />
<br />
&quot;There there little Red,&quot; said the dwarf woman who was comforting the boy and holding him tight.<br />
<br />
The tears were beginning to subside on the little dirt-caked face and the uncontrollable wailing was reducing to soft air-gulped sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is OK now. You just had a little fright.&quot; <br />
<br />
The soothing words of Nanna comforted Redwineson.		<br />
<br />
The sobs were almost gone when suddenly the door flew open with a slam causing Redwineson to jump. But he was able to swallow another round of shrieks when he saw the man who he called Poppa.<br />
<br />
Concern etched across Poppa's forehead as he crossed the dirt floor to the boy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Poppa, I'm sorry. I... I.... didn't mean to go outside,&quot; stammered the boy.<br />
<br />
Poppa looked stern. Then he burst out in that glorious laugh of the Kaladim dwarves. Full. Throaty. And joyous as he gave Redwineson the full embrace dwarves only give to each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah boy, you just scared yourself from all those stories you hear. Methinks you've been spending too much time away from your Nanna and have been listening to too many stories of the outside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Poppa I really saw an orc!&quot; It was big and black and it had fire coming out of its yellow eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Redwineson was talking too fast, the tears and sobs now a distant past.<br />
<br />
&quot;It saw me Poppa and it was gonna eat me. It had this big sword. Bigger than me! I know he wanted to eat me. But I was fast Poppa. Real fast. I ran all the way home!<br />
<br />
Poppa winked at Nanna and even in Red's distress Nanna had to smile.<br />
<br />
Poppa released Redwineson from his hug and sat the boy down on his woden chair.<br />
<br />
Nanna brought Poppa a mug of ale and served Redwineson a fresh glass of goat's milk with his favorite snack of sugared cookies.<br />
<br />
Poppa took a long sip and fished out his pipe. He poured tobacco from his pouch, packed it down and lit it, exhaling in a satisfying whoosh.<br />
<br />
Red perked up. He loved Poppa's pipe. That meant it was story time. He took a big bite of a cookie and eagerly looked up at Poppa in anticipation of a great story of Norrath.<br />
<br />
Poppa took another sip and nodded at Nanna. It was time.<br />
<br />
She got up and went to the door. She opened it. <br />
<br />
Redwineson's heart stopped			<br />
<br />
The orc ducked and entered the house.<br />
<br />
This time Redwineson couldn't swallow the scream that could be heard throughout North Kaladim. <br />

Good vocabulary too. However, I don't believe I have ever sat in a &quot;woden chair&quot;.<br />
Sorry, couldnt resist. <br />
Good luck with your story telling.<br />
