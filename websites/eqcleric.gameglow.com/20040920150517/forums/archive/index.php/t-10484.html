<br />
There are three good single aviak guard spawns for soloing, two double spawns and one triple spawn in the zone. Taking a single spawn at 19 might be a bit tough, it's probably better to be two and try to split up a double spawn.<br />
<br />
The best single spawns are the two near the Arena. You can pull one of the guards and not the other, and it's easy to zone if you're near death.<br />
<br />
Also, during night, the gnoll camp next to the South Karana zone turns into an undead camp that is also interesting.<br />
<br />
At level 24 and 25, aviak guards gets a bit green though, so then it's time to turn to bluer pastures.</div></div><hr />

I guess it all comes down to role playing<br />

<br />
Aye, Brells appreciation for surface dwellers has always been, ahhhh, hmmmm, a little bit lacking?  ;-)<br />
<br />
Tunare's ways are much more in tune with the entirety of our Earth Mother and not just with what is beneath her skin.<br />
<br />
Someday, I hope that Tunare will aid Brell in his appreciation for all of our Earth Mother's creations!<br />
