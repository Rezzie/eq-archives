We usually fight from the zone in point, however that depends (I think) on the experience of your puller.<br />
<br />
Spite golems are near impossible to mez, always target them first and DISPEL them (they have SoW). Have someone on duty to dispel everything early on in the fight, since mobs there will likely be buffed with SoW, Hero, Haste and Damage shields (mage ones.. nasty!).<br />
<br />
Keep abolish poison memmed for the rats - if the fighting is hectic uncured rat poison can cause a lot of problems (people get too low and mobs frenzy). Keep non-damage stun up for Clerics of Innoruuk... CH up there is a pain.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caelym</div><div class="date">09-21-2001, 11:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best break of Hate is no break at all (unless you want to do an old fashioned break from the port-in which can be very difficult if you're not savvy to aggro and such around the port-in).<br />
<br />
For a first Hate run I would suggest doing  what Corii mentioned - invis up, get to the safe spot in the south west corner. Most important things that everyone should be briefed on are:<br />
<br />
1. When moving from the port in to the safe spot, go only up *halfway* up the wall. If You will know if you get second floor aggro because someone will get HT'd, get the person to camp out, and come back.<br />
<br />
2. If your invis pops on the way to the safe spot, re-invis yourself if you can, or get someone else to invis you **if and only if** its completely safe and clear.<br />
<br />
3. If you get aggro on the way to the safe spot, move down to the floor and die, rogues and monks can gather corpses for res later. If you die on the wall, sometimes its harder to see corpses because they can sometimes fall into the wall with only boots visible.<br />
<br />
4. When approaching the safe spot (just at the South West corner as you pass the southern most point of the last building S) - Turn around, wait for a bit, check for aggro or anything on you. If something is on you, move to the floor and die. If its clear, continue on. The worst thing that can happen is having someone train the Safe Spot when they thought they were clear, or if they just plain panic.<br />
<br />
5. Designate an MA (Main Assist), SA (Secondary Assist), etc. Everyone should have /assist MA hotkeys<br />
<br />
6. If you get a very bad pull, or bad adds, and you're dying, get at least one cleric to camp out. Tanks and others should try to save the clerics camping out. If possible, have a necro, sk or monk FD so they can sing out when its safe to log back in. <br />
<br />
7. As Corii mentioned, Spite Golems are pesky - they don't mez. If you get one spite: Dispell him - get rid of his haste and his sow. Have a few folks on dispell duty - if you're not sure he's dispelled, dispell some more =)  If you get two spites, dispell both, slow both, get your designated SA to tank-mez the second golem while everyone else kills the first. If you get three spites, tank-mez the extras, or camp out if you can't handle it and chastise your puller for bringing three spites in the first place.<br />
<br />
Initially, the main goal is get at least one cleric to the safe spot, and a rogue to pull corpses of the fallen. If all else fails or there are a lot of patrols piles up on the wall - get a monk to go and aggro the mobs and pull them away.<br />
<br />
One thing you may have a little trouble with is the number of folks you have - 40 people is quite a few to have in Hate at the safe spot. Even with 3-4 groups it gets crowded. Get everyone to stay on the wall at first (again, halfway up). When the first few pulls happen, get everyone to surround the mob so it doesn't move, snare it, and kill. Try to keep everyone as close to the wall at the safe spot as possible until the first south west corner houses are cleared.<br />
<br />
For lots of good info, I would suggest the following guide - it doesn't include the new changes to Hate, but they're not huge changes anyway:<br />
 http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/guides/ipren2.htm <br />
<br />
I use the following map for pulling (its in the guide as a link):<br />
 http://www.drawmjil.fakta.se/oc/guides/images/PoH-MASTER.jpg <br />
<br />
Get everyone to read the guide. Rogues, monks and warriors should read it and print maps out.<br />
<br />
It is imperative that your casters (buffers) don't cast on your puller until they give the go-ahead. Once sucessfully feigned, you can buff and heal your puller. If you cast on a puller when they are not feigned, any aggro that they have on them can be transfered to the *caster* which means you'll get a visit from some mobs - typically followed by the statement: &quot;Where did these come from??&quot;. I always try to give buffers/healers a heads up when I'm pulling so they know when its safe to buff and heal me.<br />
<br />
Have a great raid! =)<br />

Try and avoid'em, and stay far away from someone who agro's one.<br />

I've rooted and camped on a rat more then once, so don't just lay down and die 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">09-22-2001, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate breaks are pretty easy - but the thing to remember the first group up there can be on their own for a while.<br />
<br />
I remember one time spending about 3 minutes with 2 spite golems in camp (about 3 or so other things mezzed) and only one primary tank, meaning after the first CH I got alot of love.<br />
<br />
If you want to be safer, get 2 clerics 1 warrior 1 sk and a chanter in the first group up.  You should be able to snare kill anything you get as long as you don't get more than 2 spite golems at once.  Then when the reinforcements arrive you can breath easier :&gt;<br />
<br />
Btw rats don't see invis in the standard way, they are infact undead critters (I know cos I nuke em :&gt;) hence you require invis to undead for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, a few of them are in the non-standard way  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
also, many mob in Hate can see both ivu and normal invis e.g. zombie, chest, lich, golem etc. so be careful<br />
<br />
if you have a high 50s chanter with you, he/she should be able to memz everything non-named in frist floor cept Golem and drake&lt;-- depends on luck<br />
<br />
a 40 ppl troop can kill most mob within 20secs in 1st floor so your chanters may be down to buff slave when puller doing well (and you ll see ppl wont be keen in assisting MA:hey why need memz? why slow mob? mob die 2 fast anyway). Any wiped out usually is because of ppl got cocky  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone get aggro at break-in if invis fades or gets spotted by a rat etc. there is no need to run around screaming for help.<br />
<br />
There is nothing bad in taking a death if you can avoid a possible wipeout and a long CR. But try dying in a spot where the corpse draggers can see you (the wall bug-thingy is a pain).</div></div><hr />

&quot;the wall bug-thingy is a pain&quot;<br />
<br />
long long ago a bored cleric playing duck and stand dance at top of the wall (before Hate buffed). Somehow she squeezed to 2nd floor and took half hr waiting for Mr. Nice GM to summon her back to teams  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khalim - Innoruuk</div><div class="date">09-27-2001, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing to mention, when we did PoH from the &quot;safe spot&quot;, we used to just run naked clerics up one at a time, as soon as one made it and camped out, then we'd bring in the rest of the guild.  It's guaranteed you can get a monk/rogue up there to do CR, but having the camped out cleric was the key.  At 60, most clerics didn't mind if they died once or twice, since they'd get a rez anyhow eventually for those corpses, if they did die.<br />
<br />
  We used this for PoH and PoF trips since the beginning, originally for PoF, we would duel outside the portal, leave a corpse, run to the wall and bind, then spam the guild with &quot;REZ ME NOW&quot;, and get rezzed out to the duel corpse.  Everyone else could run in to camp out, and that cleric could loot up, and just gate in for rezzes.<br />
<br />
  I haven't been to the planes in 6 months or so, was on an &quot;extended&quot; vacation from EQ, but I'd guess at least some of the theories I've mentioned are valid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hadekkin7th</div><div class="date">10-01-2001, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hate is quickly becoming a second home to me...the easiest break-in I've seen so far (used this strategy several times now):<br />
<br />
1st group goes up: highest levels rogue, cleric, wizard, monk, magician, warrior. (Invis before port, of course).  Upon zoning in, wizard gates back to S.Ro / assembly point.  Others run to the safe wall.  In my experience, the top of the east and south walls can be ran along safely, it's the west wall which gets you 2nd floor aggro if you go too high.  Your milage may totally vary on this, but I've never had a problem going along the top of east and south.  That may be just me, however.<br />
<br />
Along the way, if a see invis mob aggroes (lich, for example) warrior must taunt it and keep it occupied while rest of group continues running on to safe wall.  If another mob aggroes, monk must attack it until he gets aggro, while rest of group continues on.  Rogue / cleric can't die, or the whole strategy falls apart.<br />
<br />
Once at safe wall, cleric camps out; it's nice to have a cleric camped here until everyone is in place and ready.  All but magician and wizard drop out of group.  Wizard in S.Ro invites 2nd group of people, ports up to hate, then gates; magician immediately CoTH's the remainder of the group directly to the safe wall.<br />
<br />
This method is costly as it uses more Hate stones, but if the rogue (for dragging bodies) and cleric (for resses) make it to safe wall, you're practically gauranteed a foolproof breakin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorelai</div><div class="date">10-01-2001, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can be a little more efficient with the CotH method if you leave the rogue (group leader) at the port in point while still grouped with the mage. Have the Wizzie port back and forth, and have the rogue invite new arrivals and have the mage CotH them in. You save a couple of hate stones per raid this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">10-01-2001, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last weekend I did Hate totally different.  We ported 3 groups up into Hate.  We were invis, buffed, and at FM and full health.  We did not sit down but stayed at the zone in area.  We pulled to there and it worked out very well.<br />
<br />
I'm VERY used to running to the South West corner and I have never died during that run (though I get to the south wall, move up a bit, and replace regular invis with Undead Invis).<br />
