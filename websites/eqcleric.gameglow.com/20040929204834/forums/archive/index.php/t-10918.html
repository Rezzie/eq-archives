<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I´ve been thinking about this for some time and that how the resists work(or do not)<br />
My unbuffed resists can go to the following.<br />
MR-175, CR-186, FR-156,PR-116, DR-147.<br />
<br />
Against Kunark dragon that serves me well,<br />
and i tend to resist the fire AOE of TOV drakes, wurms dragon, better then the cold AOE.<br />
But when im grouped with a bard with resist song, i dont resist anything(Was fighting talendor with 295 in MR and got feared everytime).<br />
Im wondering why this is.<br />
is there some number ye may not go over?<br />
I find that if i have around 160-170 buffed in FR, CR, PR, DR i tend to resist alot, the DMG aoe.  WIth fear aoe MR around 190-200 works best.  but with a bard that goes down the drain  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Has anyone had similar experiences?<br />

(Or at least it's Lure based, meaning very hard to resist)   I'm sure someone will correct me if wrong  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone with real info on this, please post  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

People just expect to resist *everything* at 300 resists, and when they don't, or when they have a string of bad luck, they start looking for reasons why. Resists may be capped at 255 (or 200), but they don't roll over. I sit at 262 MR fully buffed, and I resist a lot more than I do unbuffed, and a whole lot more than I would at 7 MR, I'm sure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">11-26-2001, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I want to add few things..Im not talking about single incident.  At one time me and one ranger stood alone against Talendor because we both resisted the fear..well few seconds later he had me crispy with red wine sauce.<br />
I have fought talendor around 6 times now, and only time i have resisted the fear, is when i dont have a bard with me.<br />
Gorenaire is however harder to resist it seems, <br />
and Severlious(gaddemm stun) also.<br />
<br />
The fire damage from talendor seems to be unresistable, but im taking different damage every time, so resists help to reduce the damage.<br />

<br />
I useally wear only resist gear at dragons which have an AE fear of an a AE which can be resisted easily (which isnt often the chase) otherwise I go staright after HP/mana.<br />
<br />
I have to agree that when you between 180 and 200 you seem to resist more then if your higher or lower . Can be luck also , you never know.<br />

If the AE isn't lure, I resist VERY reliably with the above resists.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level based resist counts for a lot, and the magic level from my experience is hitting 58. 59 and 60 adds more of course, but to me it seemed like going from 57 to 58 made a big difference.<br />
<br />
I didn't notice the same improvement when i hit 59 and 60.<br />

<br />
Resists are based on level a lot.  A lvl 60 with worst resists will resist much more then a 55 with better resists.<br />
<br />
Resists cap at 255.  They don't roll over, they just cap.<br />
<br />
Gore is extremely difficult to resist.  Haven't fought the others ones, but i know this ;p.  My lvl 60 friend with 255 resists said he was resisting about half the time.<br />
