+++++++<br />
&quot;Speaking as a light tank, i really hate it when my health bar gets below zero and the cleric tries to wait til im near dead so he can show of his big heal spell.&quot;<br />
++++++++++++<br />
The above was cut from an overview of group roles posted by a level 32 ranger in my guild.  Specifically, the part of the healer.  There are several issues I have with this statement.  <br />
<br />
1) At 32- what cleric was he grouping with that was &quot;showing off a big heal?&quot;  Gheal is nothing to write home about! Good- yes, but 300 hp.  And the cleric has had it for several levels. <br />
 <br />
2) I don't know any cleric that would &quot;show off&quot; and allow someone to die<br />
<br />
3) This was a role discussion- and lower levels who are just getting a clue will read it and might develop a negative impression about clerics because of this. None of his other role descriptions had a mention of a death due to an error, or a discussion about someone's pompous behaviour.<br />
<br />
4) Did he really die because of the lost heal?  Why isnt the death due to an overpull?  Or his own overburn? or a train? Many factors go into a death.  Why did he label the death due to the cleric &quot;showing off?&quot;<br />
<br />
I have jokingly labelled the 20's as the &quot;get a clue&quot; levels- people are grouping against tougher mobs, learning their roles and others roles. Really LEARNING not to hit the mezzed mobs, pick the right target, assist the puller, yada yada yada. <br />
<br />
I think I will label the 30's as the &quot;know it all but really don't&quot; levels (and yes, I include myself in that  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif)<br />
<br />
**sigh** <br />
<br />
I am composing a response to him, trying to be diplomatic.  I did start by asking if this really happened, and am waiting to see what he says.<br />

<br />
I agree most clerics do not &quot;show off&quot;,well not when in combat,out of combat is another matter  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
From level 30, people are just starting to realise their characters are designed for a specific role.  By level 40, they should be easily able to fulfill their function, or they will be easily killed.</div></div><hr />

The cleric shoulda been usin minor healin on the ranger... That should bring about 1/2 his life back...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sphynkl</div><div class="date">05-19-2000, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had just gotten Sup.Heal and told the druid in our group to stop healing, that was my job.<br />
I told them, don't worry, as I let a group member fall below 2 bubbles.  I was getting ready to cast and there goes the druid again, healing him.<br />
I asked him again to stop.  I don't think it was a language barrier as he would heal the tank when he got low HP AGAIN!<br />
<br />
I quickly said 'later' and disbanded.  He obviously didn't know his role and I really didn't feel like dying because he was out of mana from healing too much.  Groups like this can be detremental to my exp bar.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabbus</div><div class="date">05-21-2000, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well its also very likely that the warrior types in his group (including rangers) most likely didn't let him med long enough to regain all his mana before pulling again, and he ran out of mana to heal.<br />
<br />
I've notice that happen so many times its ridiculous.  I hate groups that do not wait until everyone is fully medded.  Its always the non casting classes that do it also.  Go out and pull another soon as you just killed one.<br />
<br />
Not saying all are like that, but a lot of them are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salina</div><div class="date">05-23-2000, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well here's my 2cp.<br />
<br />
I had a ranger who we'd grouped with once or twice before for a short time blame me for his death.<br />
<br />
He overpulled.  I was trying to use a larger heal for better effect (efficiency anyone?) and he kept FREAKING RUNNING out of my range with a monster MM train on his butt.<br />
<br />
So he was out of range twice, and by the time I got close enough and began to cast he was dead.<br />
<br />
Was it my fault?  Was it his?  Maybe it was Verant's fault.  I dislike placing blame for things on people in situations like that.</div></div><hr />
