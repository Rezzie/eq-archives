Now the clerics are truly in last place by themselves, for sucky armor.  Gotta love Verant!  Long spawn times, expensive components, and sh***y armor too!  Yeah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Achillean</div><div class="date">11-03-1999, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well,  it leaves me to only hope that they are getting around to it..  and we just happen to be at the end of the fix it list.<br />

I still love playing a cleric, but I cant help but feel unloved and ignored by Verant.  Other classes have received numerous updates and changes, but clerics have been largely ignored.  I don't know why we are ignored, but it is starting to get under my skin.  I see useless classes like mages and druids (my opinion, based on whom I've met) get attention but the ONE class that is sought after by 99% of groups gets ZERO!  I understand the immense power potential in a cleric, but they really have kept us at bay for the most part (cast Divine Aura, get stunned, need I say more).  Maybe we need to raise our voices louder, but I would not know who to raise them at.  Others may know and help us focus our rants at someone who can make a difference.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope Verant isn't getting OSI syndrome, I left UO to get away from moronic patches and lack of attention to my needs.<br />
<br />
Fare thee well.<br />

The Caudcas, they give us a nice weapon, and sack out on the armor. That's my only guess. Still sucks. But, that could be the reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugu</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. This weapon isnt THAT great compared to other weapons out there.<br />
let me see..<br />
Caduceus of Sacrament: Damage 12 Delay 32 weight 8.0. Cleric Only.<br />
<br />
let me compare it to another weapon in game.<br />
<br />
Ghoulbane:  Damage 15, Delay 34, Weight 9.5.  Effect of Dismiss Dead.  Paladin only.<br />
<br />
OR: <br />
Fanged skull stiletto: Damage 12, delay 22, weight 5.0. classes: all that can use piercing..<br />
<br />
Well.. if that was the reason for not giving us better armor they better add damage and a undead spell on the caduceus as well... Cuz it just aint that good!<br />

<br />
Blunt typically never does as much damage as slashing or piercing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zugu</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder what hurts most.. Head smashed in with a blunt hammer or throat cutted with a sword, or your heart pierced with a stiletto.<br />
<br />
This is stated by Verant: You are in our world now.<br />
<br />
Means that Verant can make whatever weapon they like to do whatever damage they want, regardless of real world.<br />
<br />
And thus, I see no reason why any weapon type should not have abilities that other weapon types have, especially when clerics are limited to only blunt weapons.<br />
<br />
2nd, I dont see any reason why a cleric weapon shouldnt have an effect when Ghoulbane and several other weapon out there have DD spells on them. If you dont raize Damage/ratio put an effect on it...<br />
<br />
I am only stating: This cleric weapon is not THAT good. Just the best no POH/POF 1hblunt weapon, but FAR from the best no POH/POF weapon in the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalmask</div><div class="date">11-04-1999, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plus, if we're playing by what will hurt worse, everyone knows that the best weapon against plate type armor is a blunt weapon (or a piercing, but you'd have to have rolled a critical to hit a niche in the armor).   Piercing prevailed vs. chain mail types due to the holes and slashing was the best against skins and leather types...now, since EQ as far as I know doesn't have any armor type modifiers in it's rolls, I don't think a weapon damage type should really play a factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tannis</div><div class="date">11-05-1999, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is another weapon for us clerics.. a bit hard to obtain but is very nice... The Staff of Forbidden Rites.. This staff is dropped by Lady Vox the dragon in Perma.  I recently obtained one and if I remember correctly it is +9 wis +9 int 5 charges of Resurrection Dmg 25, Delay 50, CLR, SHM (two others but cant remeber them).<br />
<br />
With this I can whack things for max damage of 87 so far... Beats my Observer Staff by a long shot.. Just wish it didnt look like a souped up Staff of Writhing ...<br />

(A whole 83 point damage spell) I'm not asking for Wrath or Retribution. Smite. <br />
<br />
Maybe even make it a nice long quest involving several cities and such (not as hard as Soulfire, but similar)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beene</div><div class="date">11-08-1999, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh Im a cleric and i rarely even use a weapon. I can do alot more damage by using a paw of opolla instead of a weapon at 50th. I play my guy really defensively and use stuns alot and the exta 90-100 mana that the paw provides is an extra stun i can pop off at the last second or maybe a root to keep the mob from running off. In addition it adds good defenfense 9 ac, 9 agil, and 5 stam for a few hps. At higher levels even with a good weapon i wouldnt find myself using it more than a few times in each fight and in 10 swings i might do as much as a tank will do with one. My avg damage to a blue mob with a 8 dam weapon was less than 10. Thats not even including misses which are way over half the time. This is taken with a 90 dex, 106 str, and a 1 hand blunt in the 180s. Now say i did 50 damage in the fight of a mob that has about 2000-2500 hps. Do you think i even made a dent to justify me attacking this mob? I say clerics are more a healing casters with nice armor and just wernt meant to melee. To the person with the staff of forbiden rites. It is a very nice weapon and has great bonuses but how often do you hit for more than 43(half of what your max is stated as) to a blue mob? <br />
 ON the subject of the crappy cleric armor. I agree clerics were seriously overlooked on this one. Heck they should just give mages some armor that has the same ac as us and make thier quest easier at this point. I would rather stick with a few pieces of steel plate then waste time on those quest. <br />

<br />
i have one word...    Dawnfire<br />
<br />

Yea they will get the nice dmg but the banish will at my guess not start till lvl 44 or 46.  ie we get Banish at lvl 44 or the time when you can enter poh.  So let the twink run around with a weapon that wont do diddly<br />
