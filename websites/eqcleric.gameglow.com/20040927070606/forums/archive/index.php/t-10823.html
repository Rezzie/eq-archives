I know our AC is somewhat different than rogues since they get a higher defense.  Has anyone seen any noticeable difference going above 1050?  Im at 1035AC when I use my shield compared to 995 without.  I mainly see the difference when we hit the beetle traps in DN.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gello</div><div class="date">03-11-2001, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a firm disbeliever in the &quot;1100&quot; or &quot;1150&quot; AC softcap.  And I think anyone who looks at this analytically will agree.<br />
<br />
The AC number we see is a composite of damage avoidance and damage absorbtion (not taking damage (ie, armor ac) vs taking less damage (ie, agi)).  In early beta AC was represented by these two numbers.  Verant combined the two numbers to the one we strive for today.  So we have two variables making up our AC.<br />
<br />
In order for there to be a soft cap of a composite of variables, there has to be a stacking order to cap.  ie, all avoidance counts and the cap cuts off absorbtion, or all absorbtion counts, and the cap cuts off avoidance.  It's possible that they've implemented it this way, but it's 1) clumsy and 2) prone to making either avoidance or absorbtion absolete.<br />
<br />
The simpler, more elegant method for putting a soft cap on AC would be to soft cap avoidance and absorbtion separately.  This is the cap I think folks are experiencing.  And since we really can't tell now that the numbers are combined, there will never be a magic AC number where the diminishing returns comes to a stop.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately agility past 75 doesn't add a whole lot of ac, so it'd be tough to experiment on this theory.  It's quite possible damage avoidance has a soft cap, but damage absobtion does not.  Maybe several tests with huge samples will unravel it some day, but I just log on to play.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerie</div><div class="date">03-11-2001, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gello, what an insight! I never bothered looking at AC soft cap issue that way, and your explanation makes perfect sense. It has been postulated that damage avoidance portion of AC comes only from defense skill and agility. (from the Ranger's Glade... I don't quite remember the specific post, sorry.) And even if Verant never intentionally programmed a soft cap on damage avoidance AC, it would sooner or later be achieved by a lot of players. (i.e. a lot of people can max their defense and raise agility 200+ via equipment/buffs.)<br />
<br />
And I take those softcap numbers (1000, 1150, 1200, etc.) with a grain of salt. People tend to parse low blue mobs most often because they can parse in a controlled environment. I have a level 51 shadowknight, and parsing her log is a big pain, especially when you are fighting mobs with varying level, classes, and inherent ATK/AC rating. For example, froglok herbalist in Guk is around the same level as jin, but he's a lot harder to hit and I get hit harder than jin shamans of same level. <br />
<br />
The point is that if I am going to run a parse to test something reliably, I would pick same mobs over and over again. Problem is that to get a reliable amount of same type of mobs, people tend to go to a lower level dungeon and fight low blue mobs. (LDC's in SolB comes to mind.) Those mobs have lower ATK ratings than DN mobs and &quot;soft AC cap&quot; calculated in SolB doesn't necesarily apply to mobs at DN. (Which would verify what Norin is saying, i.e. no &quot;soft cap&quot; when fighting mobs with very high ATK rating.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">03-12-2001, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that the effect of AC against someone hitting is basically an arctan curve. For example, an ac of 0-500 might be just about equal, and the increase in AC will help only marginally, and at 500 the effect of each ac will increase a lot more up to maybe 700 and then the increases will taper off again.<br />
<br />
Against another opponent who is higher level and has better skills, the values could be 0-700 for marginal effect, 700-900 for large difference, and 900+ doesn't make that big a difference.<br />
<br />
This would mean that although there is no strict soft cap, the gain in effect decreases against lower mobs, at least, but against red mobs at 60 it might be hard to even reach the part of the curve where AC starts to get a lot of effect (at least for clerics).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">03-12-2001, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't worry much about hitting a softcap with Rayne, but I pay a lot of attention to it with Exeter, my SK.  While everyone considers Warriors to be the &quot;uber&quot; AC class I think they might be surprised how high an SK can get (SKs frequently use shields and have a few unique AC buffs).  For example, my SK is at 1100 AC completely unbuffed, and he doesn't have any Velious equipment.<br />
<br />
Anyway, an SK posted that the soft cap appeared to be roughly MobLevel*20.  My own observations have been that after a certain point, which does seem to vary based upon what I'm fighting, that additional AC doesn't seem to matter much.  Tanking Sebilite Juggs last night I didn't notice any difference between 1200 AC and 1225 AC.<br />

<br />
  If you raise your AGI, your AC increases, I'm pretty sure when VI told us what stats *really* did, they said something along the lines of &quot;AGI helps you to get hit less&quot;, which, I in turn interpreted as, sure, because it raises your AC, which makes you get hit less.  <br />
<br />
  I don't think AGI effects you getting hit or taking damage any more than having the equivalent of that AC in items as opposed to in the stats.<br />
<br />
  So that means, AC is it, thats the only number used to calculate whether you get hit or not, and whether its for full or not.  Your skill in dodge/parry/riposte/block are the only other factors in the equation.<br />

<br />
That's an excellent point, and one that is often overlooked.  I have the same concern about a lot of the &quot;stat buff&quot; tests that I see -- people fight a green mob 100 times and conclude that strength doesn't do anything.</div></div><hr />

  In response to the damage absorbtion and damage avoidance comment, I honestly don't think the two of them exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
A long time I ago I asked GZ point blank in an e-mail if there was avoidance and mitigation.  He replied &quot;No.  AC is AC, period.&quot; (I paraphrased).  I dutifully reported it and got back a bunch of &quot;GZ doesn't know what he's talking about.&quot;  I shut up after that.<br />
<br />
My personal belief is tanking is about:<br />
<br />
-&gt; Level<br />
-&gt; Avoidance Skills including /disc defensive<br />
-&gt; Hit points<br />
-&gt; AC<br />
<br />
On lesser mobs I'd put AC over hit points, but on the big guys hit points are way more important since they'll get their shots in anyway.<br />
<br />
My SK (58) tanked the General tonight (Rogue epic) for the entire fight (although I did try to feign him off twice).  Was pretty ugly how much I got healed.  The SK survived, although the other Cleric in the group got a good beat down.   I figure I had about 125-150 AC on each of the Warriors.<br />
<br />
Kinda sad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AC or HP...<br />
HP can be affected by many mitigating factors: melee, spell dmg, environmental dmg.<br />
The only spells I can think of that reduce unbuffed AC are Incapacitate/Listless Power and Cripple; but I can't think of a Shaman NPC that casts either one.<br />
There are a couple Enchanter spells that decrease agi, but that would only affect the +ac mod thus only an incremental change to the overall AC number.<br />
AC is *essentially* a constant, thereby you always benefit from whatever your current AC is.<br />
HP however is a widely ranging variable, it can be used up EXTREMELY fast especially in Velious. But when you have 400 HP and Zlandicar claws you, an AC related miss can still save your a$$.<br />
<br />
Since I hit 1k+ AC unbuffed i've seen a  noticeable difference in the #of hits and dmg taken. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 other points:<br />
1. My defense has been maxed for some time before I got 1k unbuffed AC and I am still noticing improvements<br />
2. Rumor is that ROK and SOV each have a successively higher softcap to ac than the original EQ release coding. From what i've seen I would consider this possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heihachi</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The AC being comprised of 2 numbers makes very little sense to me.  Would they then be associating avoidance and absorption numbers with each item?  Very, very likely they aren't doing this.<br />
<br />
I think it's been misinterpreted.  AC does not consist of avoidance and absorption, it is the number that accounts for avoidance and absorption.  In other words, your chance to avoid and absorb come from your AC, not the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">04-04-2001, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the idea of the two numbers with AC items is that each item has an armor type, i.e. plate, chain, leather, cloth - and the heavier the armor type the more ac is absorption. I don't know either way what is actually implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">04-05-2001, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought, it seems like it would be sort of easy to do the avoidance/absorption thing.  Any armor you put on has an AC value, and that would most likely be absorption since wearing a plate bp isn't going to help you get hit less often, but it should help you get hit for less damage.  But also when your defense skill goes up, it adds AC.  I would guess that that AC would be avoidance AC.  You have become better at having people miss you.  We only see 1 number but it seems reasonable that your base AC naked would be your avoidance AC (and agi buffs might add to your avoidance) and then when you put your armor on, you add your absorption portion.  Dunno if there would be any way to test this other then trying to get people without maxed out defense and stuff.  *shrug* But it was a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerie</div><div class="date">04-06-2001, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did more searches about this since I last posted. I came up with the same answers Seolta did - there indeed seems to be AC softcap built into the zone. In other words, the old world has lower AC softcap than Kunark, and Velious has much higher softcap, if at all.<br />
<br />
Now, this makes absolutely no sense at all - I mean, why pour in extra effort to something as superfluous as artificial AC softcap? My guess is that Verant is determined to make the old world and Kunark not so trivial...</div></div><hr />
