I went to sleep with Spell Haste3 and Healing3. I was a happy customer, as they changed the game in a way that made me just a bit more efficient.  Login Thusday morning and i have Reanimation efficiency3 and Enhancement Haste3.  Both focus effects have been rendered utterly useless for my class.<br />

Way to piss off your customers Verant, give them something then take it away.<br />

<br />
Did you have these abilities prior to the patch?<br />
<br />
Were you able to do your duties before the patch?<br />
<br />
Are you still able to do your abilities?<br />
<br />
Myself, I haven't even bothered to pay too much attention to all these items - because they are just trivial happy-go-lucky little charm items that won't affect my overall ability to do what my duty is.<br />

<br />
For the moment they are nice toys. When the high end ones start to appear, then perhaps they will make a significant improvment in abilities to buff or heal or afflict damage.<br />
<br />
Edit: I am talking from a L60 perspective. I am basing my oppinon on the fact that if in a grp, I don't remember the last time I had to tell them &quot;Hold pulls I need to med&quot;. The Dmg Absorbtion, Dmg output , CC, and Mob Debuffs in the game today are very good. This puts much less work on me. <br />

<br />
An item with Healing efficiency 3 would mean that Divine Light would be a rather good heal, so I can understand Traturn's reaction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traturn</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand i didnt have any of these effects before the patches and I should take what i can get from Verant.  I can still do my job of healing and buffing as well as before.  I'm just pissed that they made such a widescale change on their new focus effects.   Do they just randomly throw darts to determine itmes/effects? or is there some method to their madness.<br />
<br />
Was the focus effect reshuffle a simple database error, like the fear/call of bones one? (Human Error)<br />
<br />
Or was this reshuffle a REACTION to how they distributed effects?  Say 60 people on a raid have Ring of Shissar, 33% are healers.  Verant realises that this is 20%(or something) overall more effective they just made the healers.  'Gee we screwed up here, instead of rebuilding all our encounters, remove the heal focus effect from the ring everyone has'<br />
<br />
I was looking forward to not having to sacrifice HP anymore for a fast_cast_focus effect.  I was excited last night when i saw my Onyx Gaunts had the fast_cast_focus on it, and was a happy camper.  Login today, and its gone.  Hail, an_unhappy_customer. <br />
<br />
I'm not supprised the focus effects got changed, just angry that they misimplemented the focus items in the first place.  And i am saddened that i have to ask for magi focus ring again =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I give you 10 dollars.  Later I demand 8 dollars back.<br />
<br />
When you wine and yell at me, I will point out that you still made out with 2 dollars you didn't have before.<br />
<br />
Would you rather have nothing?  Then for Christ's sake STHU and deal with it.<br />
<br />
Not only do mistakes happen, but with Verant you need to expect they will.<br />
<br />
Main reason I don't buy software when it first comes out.  I wait till bugs are fixed.  Same thing here.  Before you go and sell all your once good stuff for what is apparently now good, wait a bit.<br />
<br />
If you want to jump at it quickly hoping to make or save a buck, I have no remorse for you.  If you can't have a little patience I don't want to hear about it.<br />
<br />
We are given some abilities that may be of help.  Some are more helpful than others.<br />
<br />
Do I see why you are pissed?  Yes I do.<br />
<br />
Do I think you have any right to be?  No.  Do I care if your pissed?  No.<br />
<br />
The only reason you should be mad at all is if you sold off a very valuable piece for something that without the bonus would have sucked.  But then again I have to say.  Patience.  And you did it to yourself.<br />
<br />
It isn't like we don't have past precident to go on.  We know Verant's track record with patches, and more patches, and fix patches to the patches.  If you honestly thought that what you saw immediately is what you were going to end up with...think a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kanroc</div><div class="date">06-06-2002, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt;&gt;It is a simple analogy.<br />

&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;When you wine and yell at me, I will point out that you still made out with 2 dollars you didn't have before.<br />
<br />
No, I still have 10 dollars, because you don't get 8 back.  Or I elect to cede to your request and give the 8 dollars back.  You can ask me to return something you gave me.  You can't take 8 dollars out of my wallet, tell me you might have taken something, and get away with it.<br />
<br />
Any reasonable human being expects that if GIVEN something (and told that it is theirs to keep), that they won't wake up the next day to find it taken back.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Would you rather have nothing? Then for Christ's sake STHU and deal with it.<br />
<br />
Yes, I would rather have nothing.  Not only would I rather have nothing now, I'd rather have had nothing yesterday.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Not only do mistakes happen, but with Verant you need to expect they will.<br />
<br />
Sure, mistakes will happen.  That doesn't excuse that they happen.  If I run over a kid on the street accidentally, I can't just say 'mistakes happen' to make it all better.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Main reason I don't buy software when it first comes out. I wait till bugs are fixed. Same thing here. Before you go and sell all your once good stuff for what is apparently now good, wait a bit.<br />
<br />
EQ was released in 1999.  Expansions annually.  Velious has been out since early December.  Sure, you're comparing it to the fallout of a patch, but thats still pretty weak.  Again, 'mistakes happen' doesn't excuse mistakes happening.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;If you want to jump at it quickly hoping to make or save a buck, I have no remorse for you. If you can't have a little patience I don't want to hear about it.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to hear about it, don't read it.  Nobody is invading your home shouting in your ear.  This is a board for cleric issues.  Many of the nerfs affect a lot of the people this board targets, making it a reasonable place to voice displeasure.  A lot of people are pissed, and they aren't searching for your remorse.<br />
<br />
Remorse is left for those with guilt, and unless there's something I don't know, no reasonable person expects your remorse with regard to focus nerfs.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;We are given some abilities that may be of help. Some are more helpful than others.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Do I see why you are pissed? Yes I do.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Do I think you have any right to be? No. Do I care if your pissed? No.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;The only reason you should be mad at all is if you sold off a very valuable piece for something that without the bonus would have sucked. But then again I have to say. Patience. And you did it to yourself.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;It isn't like we don't have past precident to go on. We know Verant's track record with patches, and more patches, and fix patches to the patches. If you honestly thought that what you saw immediately is what you were going to end up with...think a little.<br />
<br />
There's no doubt that some of the focus items were overpowered, considering the difficulty in obtaining the items.  Onyx gauntlets, ring of the shissar, and other such items are NOT easy to get, and the effects put on them aren't nearly so obvious problems as you seem to think they are.  Sure, they're unbalancing for what we've come to expect from some encounters, but thats an unavoidable consequence of 'rebalancing' casters.<br />
<br />
If the premise behind balancing casters is to increase their utility, you'll be hard pressed to do so without impacting the balance of the game.<br />
<br />
Regardless, a small bit of forethought would've avoided this entire issue.  They claim that the effects now are what was intended, and given the rapidity of the changes, they knew their intent yesterday.<br />
<br />
They blew it. Again.  Folks being pissed is perfectly reasonable. ;p<br />

<br />
You don't get to have what you want.<br />
<br />
You are in there world now.<br />
<br />
When they want something they will get it.  You don't have the choice to say no.<br />
<br />
How about this.  I promise you that we will go on a vacation to the Bahamas.  When we actually go though I take you to Hawaii.  How pessimistic do you want to be?  So Hawaii isn't the Bahamas.  I lied.  But you still gain.  This is a situation of too bad, count your blessings that you got anthing at all.  You aren't forced to go on the trip as you aren't forced to continue playing.  These effects don't hurt you from the baseline we have been playing on previous.  It is kind of like a misrepresented and inflated bank account.  When you notice that you have an additional 3grand in your bank and then go to check with the bank only to realize they made an error, it is just that an error.  You don't get to plead your case that you deserve the money and that it was their mistake so give it back.  Maybe this is a better illustration of what I mean.  The bank doesn't owe you anything from this mistake.<br />
<br />
My biggest pet pieve is when people think they are entitled to anything at all.  No one owes you anything.  No one has to even listen to your desires, or mine for that matter.<br />
<br />
As I said, given Verant's history, it is to be expected.  Did you really think that everything would go without a hitch?  I like playing Verant roulette.  Whenever a patch comes out it is a game to figure out what has been broken now.  You know there had to be something broken as it is the nature of the beast.  But what?<br />
<br />
Everyone needs to stop getting their hopes up that Verant will pull off a miracle when they change stuff.<br />
<br />
Maybe I have just accepted that when Verant gives us something, anything, I will enjoy it.  As it is more than I have now, period, I will take it.<br />
<br />
 Any reasonable human being expects that if GIVEN something (and told that it is theirs to keep)<br />
<br />
We were never told we could keep it.  Verant isn't a human being and when have basic rules ever actually applied to corporations.  It isn't like we have a relationship of equals or even near equals with Verant.  It is a relationship of a god to its creation.  What it gives is freely taken back.  If you don't play under that assumption you must be very very displeased and ignorant.  Fool me once shame on me, fool me scores of times like Verant has and get a clue.</div></div><hr />

I haven't logged in since either of the patches.. so anything I had that was taken away was didn't really affect me.<br />
<br />
/shrug... these focus effects just seem like a cool novelty for some lucky people. No big deal.<br />
<br />
You guys all need to really deal with the fact that things are going to change. Just because something happened in one patch that you like, doesn't mean its going to stick around.<br />

We had long lists posted at graffe's and castersrealm before launch. People logged in and checked on the items and, sure enough, there were the effects.<br />
<br />
Now, some people started trading or buy/selling to get the effects they wanted, logged out for the night and logged back in today for what? Reanimation II? O boy. Feeling peeved is justifiable. <br />

<br />
Every single time there is something on the test server it comes with the assumption that it can and may change before going live.  Many of those lists were started before the patches on the live servers started.<br />
<br />
Then it comes live and things begin to get confirmed.  Ok.  Then once again remember we are dealing with Verant here and name a time a decent sized patch or a patch with a decent amount of new content went off without a hitch or major changes.<br />
