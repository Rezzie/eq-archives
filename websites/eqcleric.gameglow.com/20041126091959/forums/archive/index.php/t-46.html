<br />
You tell a_wizard00, &quot;Ready for a rezz?&quot;<br />
<br />
A_wizard00 tells you, &quot;I'd rather have a level 56 rezz, so don't rezz me&quot;<br />
<br />
Mmmmkay - that was the last offer for a rezz that wizard will get from me.  <br />
<br />
/em mem's up revive for the next time that wizard ask for a rezz =P<br />

<br />
I think that wizzard was just plain stupid.  Granted people are levelling up and some of the people might and are probably at the point of being able to do the 96% xp res, but to turn down a level 49 res is just plain silly.  The likelyhood of finding the 96% res is substantially harder than finding a 39 or even a 49 res.<br />

<br />
I was passing through Trakanon's last night and a 10th level shaman iksar was harassing me for the 49th res.<br />
<br />
10th level?  Sheesh.  <br />
<br />
He can get back his exp lost faster than I can med back 700 mana.  LOL</div></div><hr />

If i ask someone if they needed a res and they said no, whether it be cause they might have a 56th level coming along or whatever, i just say &quot;ok&quot; and move along. <br />
<br />
Now if ive moved on and ressed others or moved away from the area and he gives me a tell like &quot;Umm, my 56th level res fell through can you res me now&quot; THEN i might have to consider a smart reply. Maybe &quot;Im busy right now but there is a 49th level paladin here that might can Revive you.&quot; Or &quot;I really dont have the mana now, i really need to get to 56th so i can upgrade from this crappy res i have. Have a nice day!&quot;</div></div><hr />

2 night ago, I got a tell in E FP from a guy that he need a rez. He told me he died in W FP and when I did a who, he is in Firiona Vie.  So, I said ok, and right after that, he send me a tell said wait, he is trying to get a lvl 52 cleric to rez him(I am only 40 at the moment).  I was annoyed and went on my way.  Couple mins later, he sent me a tell again said the 52 cleric seems to be afk and can I go rez him.  Being nice, I said ok and heading towards W FP and he sent me a tell to hold on again.  Either that AFK 52 cleric reply to him or he saw a new target to beg, I don't know but I am pissed.  I go on my merry way and mins later, he had the nerve to sent me a tell once more and said this<br />
'Ok I will take it'<br />
'I hate to do it, but it is my only way back'<br />
<br />
I almost explode and put him on ignore right away.<br />
Now that I have calm down, I just realize I could have done something else, I should go find his corpse, start casting revive and talk to him so that he miss that confirmation box, then go on my merry way.<br />
<br />
Am I evil or am I evil?<br />

<br />
I would have either did what you did and put him on ignore, or sent him a tell back explaining that you weren't going to waste your time ressing him because of what he had just done to you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenobe</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well on the topic, I was camping Regis last night when I get a tell asking for a revive.  I say sure if you can drag em to me so I don't loose my camp.  They then ask for my loc 3 times... 10 mins later another where are you again?  So I do a /who name to see who and where they both are.  The one dragging the corpse is leve 3 and the one he wants me to revive is in Qeyhills and LEVEL1!<br />
<br />
I didn't believe it and frankly nobody else I told did either..... got a good laugh out of it   http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
5 months ago, I'm wandering through Befallon on one of my little walkabouts.  Just buffing folks and smashing trains and being friendly.  I could get a tad of experience on a green hag or the ghost is about all.<br />
<br />
I had run down to the basement to res a guy and was wandering up teh stairs to the tower.<br />
<br />
There was a druid there who started saying LEAVE! over and over and over and over.<br />
<br />
LEAVE!<br />
LEAVE!<br />
LEAVE!<br />
LEAVE!<br />
<br />
He was really spastic.  Yammering about how the tower was his and I should LEAVE!.<br />
<br />
Whiel I was watching this and was caught between amusement and being offenede by his attitude, a hag spawned and attacked me.  So naturally I blast it twice an the hag lays down.<br />
<br />
He just keeps spamming the one word LEAVE!  So the stubborn headed souther boy in me takes hold and I was overly sweet and polite and explained how I only wanted to share and would take only half.<br />
<br />
He of course was a raving lunatic by this point.  I explained how there are not enough spawns in Norrath for every person to claim a whole room, the he needs to be nicer or one day he will be in lower guk and find that people remember him.<br />
<br />
I stayed to kill one more greater dark bone and then wandered on my merry way while listening to his abuse.<br />
<br />
So here we are a few days ago in lower guk.<br />
<br />
Ofbac shouts, &quot;50 cleirc looking for fun and excitement  There's a new verant rule that you have to have a dwarf in every group, and you don't want a dwarven wizard so get a cleirc while you can.&quot;  - one of my standard lines.<br />
<br />
Abusivedruid tells you &quot;can i get a rez pls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ofbac chuckles.<br />
<br />
Abusivedruid tells you &quot;can i get a rez pls?  i'm almost out of time like nearly 2 hours&quot;<br />
<br />
Ofbac tells Abusivedruid &quot;do you remember me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abusivedruid tells you &quot;yeah, didn't we meet in unrest once?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ofbac tells Abusivedruid &quot;have a nice day&quot;<br />
<br />
Ofbac: /ignore abusivedruid.<br />
