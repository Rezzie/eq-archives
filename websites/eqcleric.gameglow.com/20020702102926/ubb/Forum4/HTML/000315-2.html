</FONT><HR>Just finished helping with a six day long RF camp on Karana this morning and yes we ended up getting KS'd (which happens A L O T on Karana) Let me run down the details and see if the sounds fishy to you all.<BR>Cleric started camping RF Tuesday May 28th 2 PM EST was at RF camp 24/7 with several guildmates and friends. Of course we noticed the occasional "pop - up scout" But it wasn't until this morning (Monday June 3rd) at about 5:30 am that we noticed one of the "uber" scouts pop up. About 20min later every single member in the guild who was on line appears in the zone. WTF? So of course not to be show up we call in our troops as well. So Guildleaders start talking, uber_guild01 feeds us the FFA BS line blah blah blah, and then start training Chromodracs (sp?) on us to disspell our raid group. nice eh? /petition. Enter GM. Blah blah blah...."uber_guild01 stop training mobs." At this point we have 30+ people in the zone to help us when/if RF spawns. <BR>10:00AM P O P right smack dab in the middle of our little camp circle,/log, engage, dead. RF pops again right on top of our raid party /log, engage, dead, KS'D :O( Dispite being warned Uber_guild01 sees fit they they need the RF loot more than anyone else in the entire server. BAH! The next thing that happens ....GM's all over RF camp....Guildleader talks to them and at this point it is going to lead GM for our server. Hopefully with all the /report /log chat and /petition will prevail. <BR>The reason why I though this was fishy is I wonder if it was more than pure stupid dumb luck that they came in force 4 hours before the spawn or is there a new cheat program availiable that VI doesn't know about yet?<BR>BTW not to mention any names but the Uber_guild01 is called **cough** N O V A E **cough**  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR>TanneFletchy<BR>House Al Nasir<BR>Karana Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>OHHHH. My very favorite part about the cleric epic is that it is the WORST SOLID CAMP (Solid not being. Run into com with 6 people, kill black reaver, look for jade reaver drop, come back in an hour for a month (I would enjoy it. Could you imagine the loot? MoSS's would rot like crazy, and everyone of your small helping group would have their ears sprouting with Black Reaver junk). 5 minutes an hour. Heck, even bind people there to do it. RAGEFIRE is the WORST SOLID CAMP. Not worst for rare items in rare raids from rare mobs. WORST FOR STARING AT THE GROUND. WAITING. WORST FOR KS'ING. You don't here stuff like this for the<BR>Warrior<BR>Ranger<BR>Rouge<BR>Shadowknight<BR>Paladin<BR>Bard<BR>Monk<BR>Beastlord<BR>Druid<BR>Shaman (2 in my guild have their epics lol)<BR>Necromancer<BR>Mage<BR>Wizzard<BR>Enchanter<BR>Epics.<BR>Why? Alot are "3 gate in, kill, no epic, come back in hour and port out (If you can get a wizzie to port in out, mage for COH (especcally the Kedge Keep guy for the mage, which I hear is pretty much the bottleneck). Warrior/Bard Scales? "Hey, vox/naggy up now. Lets go kill them if we have the force". Nobody was sitting at the camp spot to tell you not to. Druid epic's Fayeieydrawayr (Mangled alot) is " Port to boat zone. Catch boat. Boat along hitting track". (Or is it triggered, which would be Easier).<BR>I don't know much about other epics (I think I should go read up on every one of them, be worth my time), but I can safely say the cleric one would benifit from being more like the ghoulbane. Give us 30 different level 58-65 mobs on a 3 hour timer each in raid zones, and some open zones. And in the Bottom of Kaeorsa/Nurga/Durga/Dalnir/unused kunark dungeon 01. Make one drop from a Terrisnia repop thats level 59 and aoes   cold 200pt nuke that gives the effect of shadow vortex (SK atk debuff)(frozen shadow   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif">) in TOFS. Make it take 90 hours anyways, but in a way we could do it a bit at a time, or pick up a part while raiding. There would be some of a choke point based on the mob's repop time, and which parts are easiest/fastest/clostest to a common zone cause: "Somebody is camping such and such. Lets try other part I don't have yet". <BR>Please, don't put it in anything below a 30+ zone however, cause by then people know a bit more bout the game. (A Kobold Emmisary near Steamfont Mino Caves. Level 27 Shaman that a 23 cleric/30 druid/24 monk/26 Enchanter had problems with. In a NEWBIE ZONE. Its for the Cleric Symbol of Quellious Btw)<P>Could somebody show me a flaw in this Idea?<p>[This message has been edited by Ikeren (edited 06-12-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>1st off, Ikeran.<P>The point is that 40 different things that are on a 3 hour timer STILL means that the entire quest takes 40*3 hours to do! You can't get around that. If 40 people are doing the quest at once, then each one doing a different part means they'd all do all the parts in 120 hours. Period. VI won't go for that its WAY to easy. Quantity of steps does not a good quest make.<P>Not to Rayne's comments...<P>OMG. You people just want to re-create Stumpwatch.<P>Hello, watching the ground is no fun.<P>>>>><BR>I appreciate your concern for the problems with the quest, but vehemently disagree with both Dasmiter's and Thecklos's proposed solutions. I'll be damned if I'm running around and staring at the ground hoping to grab a 10 second ground spawn. That's just silly.<P>Verant just needs to grow a pair of balls, grandfather in the Clerics who are waiting on Ragefire so they can finish and re-design the quest compleletely. They should re-design the other quests too to bring some parity to the game. It's ridiculous right now.<P>Rayne<BR>>>>>>><P>I also disagree with a despawning ground spawn. The Ground spawn should be left there until someone picks it up, or possibly despawn after 24 hours, maybe. But the next one should spawn 72-120 hours (3-5 days) AFTER the current one is picked up.<P>IMHO,your opinion is somewhat selfish. For you its borring having to wait for a ground spawn, thats cool and all becasue it is borring. BUT the way it is now brings out the absolute worst in the player population. I've never wanted to quit EQ becasue of the game itself, just like the game itself hasn't kept me playing for over 3 years. Its the players, the people behind the PCs that make the experience good or bad. <P>VI has said and done things to limit the amount of damage that "grief" players can do. Apparently they feel that a few people who derive pleasure at other paying peoples expense is not good for the game on a whole. That said, the current RF setup goes against this philospohy! In fact it encourages and in some cases forces us all to engage in grief activities in order to complete the quest. This is no longer an "in game" problem. Real people are getting real angry because they're getting screwed out of their time and energy by people taking advantage of a loophole that VI won't fix.<P>My solution resolves that problem. Screw SEQ, it does what it does regardless of a ground spawn or whatever. If it provides and unfair advantage in one case, then it provides and unfair advantage in ALL cases.<P>The bottom line is that quest NEEDS to be changed. Not everyone is going to achieve every quest. I for one DON'T want to see the quest made any easier. I DON'T want to see RF spawn any more frequently than he does now. What I DO want is for there to be way to finish this quest without a small fraction of a server base being able to disrupt the play of everyone else.<P>Heck I'd settle for VI saying that any guild caught KSing RF would be immediately disbanded and have accounts suspended. At least make people THINK before they just decide to intentionally screw over someone else.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ikeren,<P>You are very wrong about no other class having to camp mobs like RF. In some cases it's worse. In the case of Enchanters, they have to camp a mob in Neriak 3rd Gate (who came up with that bright idea?). So not only is the mob frequently KSed by two manaburn wizards and a level 20 enchanter, but you are doing nothing but sitting on your rump waiting for her to spawn because there's nothing else to do in the zone.<P>There are some classes in the game whose epic is so hard to get because of camps like Verina Tomb. bah.<P>-Lolli</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Lolli, you got it backwards! The enchanter part in Neriak 3rd Gate is MUCH easier. You have a statis spawn that is not "easy" to just gate in and kill. You have to either have your 1 or 2 killing groups (we did it with 2 non buffed, half dressed, half HP, half mana group of mid 50s). You kill the guy in 1 minute, then you loot the corpse...<P>The cleric mob is by FAR the worst. <P>You have an easy to get to, outdoor zone mob with both Wizard, Druid and walk in zones near by. Then you have the dual mobs. See what makes it screwed is that it doesn't matter who kills the original RageFire. A group can be hard at work killing him, then have a guild pop in at the last 10% and total jack the dragon as soon as he spawns. They don't even have to touch the guy you've been camping for 2 weeks straight. No other epic comes close to the human problems caused by the cleric epic.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>First off I play on the Luclin server and we have had a list system from almost day one of the cleric epic being brought into being.  The 4 or 5 power guilds at the time decided that it was more productive to have a list and abide by it rather than fighting each other and really not gaining anyone any time.  The system has worked since they agreed to it with less than a handful of KS attempts in the whole time the list has been up and running.  All the guilds on the server work in cooperation and understand that the list is worth having.  Every once in a while there is a rumbling from clerics near the end of the 50+ cleric list but none seem to want to risk being blacklisted by trying to KS it.  If you do the math that 50 person list equates to about 40 or more week wait.  I personally would like to see them Change the epic quest a bit maybe make it tougher and with an end that doesnt promote KSing.  <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000315-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum4/HTML/000315.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000315&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum4&number=4&thisthread=000315&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
