</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Kenobe:<BR><B>This topic is why I wish there were more serveres and they were capped at 100 or so.<P>This really has nothing specicific to do about one epic, but more the whole high-end umber loot race that this game has evolved into.<P>There is a huge difference between RIGHT and NICE.  <P>Yes you have the RIGHT to take down ragefire if you are the first there with the forces to do so.  It would be NICE if you let that cleric who was there 2 days clearing giants, take 30 mins to gather troops.<P>I happen to prefer NICE.  I dont have my stick and havent even started it at level 54 and really dont intend to.  I have done CR's for guilds that happen to get wiped out in the same zone, and never had anyone deny my aid.  Yeah the stick would save time, but when CR's are too easy and only a matter of right clicking 50 times then you loose part of the risk/rewards of the game.  Yes long CR's, like em or not, promote strategy, teamwork and caution.<P>I personally think Epics have done more harm to EQ then they will ever do good.  Umber guilds have become even more umber and have no regard for caution.  I have seen it a dozen times.  They show up at a zone and plow through killing everthing in their path with no regards for anyone, they sometimes even have the nerve to ask the few hunting groups there to camp out while they kill Mob Boss007, to reduce lag.  All they have to do is camp a rogue and a cleric with a stick(whos often a guild tool) and they are safe.  That in itself is not such a bad thing, however the attitude it creates is.  These are the same group of folks that pour into Solb or KC and without even asking if anyone else is there, they kill what they want Ragefire, VS whatever.<P>If it was up to me I would move all the mobs for the epics to one zone and call it Umber guilds playground.  The super High end Mobs are all that there is to challange them.  Hunting in most zones for them is like playing dodge ball with an M-16.<P>Sorry im gettting off topic here, and will end it with this.<P>Nobody has to be NICE, so don't expect them to be.  Rayne hit the nail on the head, don't set yourself up for getting KS'ed.  If you are going to camp him, then make sure you have forces to do it in the zone.<P>Good luck all, I'm sticking with the poor mans epic, res the enchanter, res the bard and grab a snack.<BR></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I think you nailed the biggest problem with this whole quest...<P>At least on CT, it's becoming more and more obvious that if you want an epic you must be willing to do anything to get it. In essence, the "uber" attitude many of us hate.<P>So we have the clerics who literally camp Ragefire, the "nice" clerics and those who did what they had to for it. For some, that simply meant going down and killing him (as it was in the earliest days) and for some it meant running past people already there.<P>As another cleric put it (I hope she doesn't mind my reposting)...<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Posted by Aracnakat:<BR><B>Here's my take on the situation .. and what I hate most about it .... these are my feelings alone.<BR>I HATE having to win when someone else loses .. I hate sitting in Nag's lair with 25 other clerics all shouting insults at each other claiming that when Ragefire spawns that it's THEIRS .. I hate that Verant has put us into this situation ...<P>I hate that I can't "win" without someone else "losing."<P>The other day SS killed Nag. The next day a group of us headed to the lair to sit and wait for Rage (for my epic) ... when we arrived there were already several clerics there "claiming" the camp ...<P>We decided to leave .. as was my choice as well because I refuse to get into a pissing match .. I refuse to "rush" to turn in my pearl while other clerics do the same thing ...<P>At this point I've decided that more then likely I will wait until every other cleric on CT has their epic ...<P>Simply put .. I don't want to fight over something that is meant to be "special" .. it sorta takes the joy and excitement out of it.<P>Verant forgets ... this is a game .. and as such, should be fun for all ... <P>The cleric epic (and many of the other epic weapons) .. is not fun! It's a quest where when you get to a certain stage you get frustrated, angry and upset ... and more so you get these bad feelings towards other clerics.<P>I won't have it.<P>~Kat</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Which exemplifies the problem... this is a race Verant has put us in. And like all races, there can be only one winner. Worse, this race has no rules, no guidelines and no judges so anything goes. When someone does something someone else doesn't like... tough. You can't appeal the outcome to anyone. And in EQ, just like RL, the strong will always win these types of races. Assuming you can even run the race in the first place...<P>I'm not giving up... but at the same time Verant has told us this is "as intended(tm)". Which means they gave us the biggest, juiciest carrot in the game. But it wasn't for US that they gave it to us... it was for EVERYONE ELSE. Then, in essence, told us we had to fight each other for it. So we start our own little wars over it and when the few calm and rational people get through the response is "Well, you're doing just fine as it is. Besides, it's too easy to do and we'd have to rewrite it and we're just too busy to do that. Toodles"<P>So here we stand, in the middle of the fields of war having been told there is no hope for peace. The wars must go on. Heads must be stepped on to reach the goal.<P>The point? We, the cleric class, are the losers.<P>I return you to your regularly scheduled LairWars '01, already in progress...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Greetings!<P>This is how the latest Ragefire killing I was at went:<P>My three friends and I were in Stone Spider grinding out experience, and listening to a group prepare for Nagafen. When they defeated Naggy I went down and ressed most of their dead.<P>They had some ninja-loot incident on their raid and so many people remained to await the GM for some resolution. I went back to pulling spiders and imps.<P>About two hours later I get a tell from a cleric that was at the Nagafen raid saying Ragefire had spawned. I notified my guild, people showed up, we waited with a killing force until the GM had resolved the issue from the earlier Nag run. The other groups left/fell back to watch/whatever.<P>My small amount of effort in popping in to congratulate the Naggy killers, and ress their dead, paid off in one of our clerics getting his sprinkler.<P>Everbody walked away happy (and the Nagafen ninja-looter received an account ban)<P>------------------<BR><B>Thistleburr</B>, High Priestess of Bristlebane<BR><A HREF="http://www.the-elitists.com" TARGET=_blank><I>The Elitists</I></A>, Tribunal Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>/agree Kenobe Boanerges and Aracnakat<P>What great posts all three of you.<P>They broke the game when they raised the level limit.<P>They broke it more when they put in epics, particularly the way they put in epics.<P>I particularly agree with Kenobe's poor man's res stick.  I thought that was hilarious.  Res the chanter, res the bard and have a snack.  Heh.<P>They had to retune the old planes because of the way they put epic drops in there.  Couldn't just do the easy thing and take the drops off those mobs, they decide instead to change the entire zone.<P>Changing the zone benefits no one.  Most non ebay, non PL'd, non twinked folks had already done the planes to death and had no interest in going back.  Those of us who have just recently gotten to be level appropriate to go there wanted the same experience everyone else had.  Now a group of 46 to 50 level players can't go to the planes.  We will never get to do what you First Ones got to do.  Pfffffffft.<P>Boanerges, I highly recommend giving up on the camp until they change it.  I enjoy it completely.  I never give it a second thought.  It is so obviously the right decision for me.  If it is not for you, then I hope you get to go down there and get it, without any of the built in annoyances like server outages and KSing and friends inevitably having to log so you end up without the horses to get it done at the 49th hour of your camp when Rage spawns and there is not enough of your friends on line at 330 in the morning, because the whole thing is working as intended.<P>Tarf</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>That is the biggest load of **** i have heard in along time......What you suggest endorses a type of KS (perhaps not by Verant standards but certainly player to player conduct)..... I would rather throw away my passwords before i would allow myself come to this point where i would jump across someone, whether it be a cleric from a no<BR>name guild or from a cleric in a high powered<BR>guild.........Everyone deserves a chance.. many need time to maneuver....in  a perfect world we could call in the troops and have them sit there holding hands singing cooombya my friends......so come on<BR>.......come down off your high horse and realize that essential no one ( the numbers you speak of) are going to sit in a lair of Zordak for that long in hopes for a pop... IN the real world people have jobs families..<BR>lmao my goodness eq money doesnt pay the bills...<P><BR>i dont think its to hard to respect others enough to take turns..patiently or wait in line....<P>Last time i looked i play with other characters/ other people with hopes and dreams...not verant and there play nice rules.......makes me sick to see someone<BR>endorse this style of playing... it takes away the alliances that we have worked so hard to build in Norrath.....<P>But hell thanks for the Laugh and the Smile...

</FONT><HR>I kinda Feel for y'all. We have it pretty good on E Marr it would seem. General consensus is that if there is a CLERIC sitting on the rage spawne and he can muster few needed to keep FG's clear the camp is his/hers. Everyone pretty much respects that. There is generally a generous "grace period" when Rage actually does spawn for the cleric to muster troops for the kill.<P><BR>Da Pope,<BR>Lith Ahntalon<BR>Storm's Fury</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I wish I had time to read this entire thread, all three pages of it.  However I don't, I guess I'm a casual board camper, and as such this comment may be outdated.  However what I do see here is this:  <P>Rayne's system is not designed to be fair.  It's not designed to make people happy.  Rayne's post is actually a quest spoiler.  Just not everyone sees it as such.<P>This is the quest:<BR>Sometime between 0 and 72 hours after a known event (naggy/previous Zordakalicious is killed) a trigger event will occur (Zordak will spawn).  When that trigger event occurs you must turn in a shimmering pearl (obtained in a different quest), then kill one mob which is triggerd and upon dying triggers another mob.  Kill that mob to recieve an item, which when turned in gives you the holy bonker of make your dead friends come back naked and in pain.  However you must accomplish this task before the immanant attack by some group that you don't beling to occurs.  This attack may come within minutes or not for hours, it is random (not unlike the timing on the trigger event).  If you do not acomplish your goal before this attack occurs you have failed, and must start this quest over (note not necessarily the other quest which results in the shimmering pearl).  If you succeed congradulations.  If you fail, prepair more and better luck next time.<P>There it is.<P>Sound's harsh?  Well, VI didn't create this quest, they only created the foundation upon which this quest came into being.  They are unwilling to alter he foundation regardles of their opinion on the quest that was built on it.  We created this quest, but look on the bright side, Rayne was kind enough to give you the spoiler.  Like any other quest spoiler, you can choose to ignore it, but if you fail, you have noone to blame but yourself.<P>This is the way EQ is right now.  This may never change, though it might.  When the second cleric in my guild completed this quest this is exactly how he did it.  If I could I would have done it the same way.  It was actually kinda fun.  I wasn't there for the entire 72+ hours he spent, but there were people there for that long.  However a force sufficient or nearly so to complete this quest was there most of the time, with just small times during a sort of changing of the guards ocured.  This does not have to be a boring camp either.  We pulled EL to Naggy's lair and AE'd.  I personally witnessed a Tranix crown and GEBs drop in ONE pull.  I earned Exp, perople got loot (Though not much to be had as a cleric there if you're like me and believe GEBs are for pyjamas =P).  I saw a group of 5 clerics KS mobs from a group of 3 wizards a cleric chanter and war.  <P>I am envious of the support that cleric had.  To have so many people there, giving so much.  I have not earned that much within the guild or server comminuty, and may never.  I was lucky, I completed the above quest the hard way.  But like I said I was lucky, Zordak spawned about 16hours after the previos Zodakalicious died.  This was back when we all had theories like 24 hours after Naggy/previous Zordakalicious dies the next will spawn.  I thought that the spawn would occur at 8am my time, about an hour before a planned ToV raid.  I was afraid I would have to ask the guild to delay their ToV raid to help me bring down the beast.  I was lucky Zordak spawned for me 4 hours eairly, and my friends came pouring in faster than the attack by other forces occured and I succeded in this quest.  Since then I've seen or helped people doing this quest in a number of occasions.<P>Out dated and off topic?  Maybe, but I for one have to say, "Thank you Rayne, for giving us this quest spoiler so we now know how to complete this quest."<P>For those of you who decide to undertake this quest, I wish you luck.  For those of you who wish to undertake some other quest with the same reward, unless you are in the right community that quest may not exist, and you need to accept that.  I'm sympathetic to your plight, but there is nothing I can do for you.<P>-Atro Demerzel, cleric of The Companions on the Tribunal.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The one thing that most of you are overlooking and that causes a lot of the problems is the nature of the spawn and server resets.  I believe but am not 100% sure that Ragefire is the only epic encounter that gets penalized by server resets.  When the server or zone goes down Nagafen is respawned which starts the whole ugly cycle all over again.  Kill nagafen and wait for days for Ragefire to pop.  We actually had a streak of almost two weeks one time due to server resets and zone resets with no Ragefire spawns.  We have also had guilds buffing up ready to trigger the spawn and Nagafen spawns and despawns Ragefire.  If they fixed it so Ragefire was independent of Nagafen it would solve a lot of problems.  It seems that verant has a goal of 2-3 epics per week, but with the constant resets of the servers and zones this often time does not happen creating even more of a backlog.<P>Just something to think about.<P>Kynneth of Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Another update from our utopia on Luclin. Since my last post, Zordak spawned two more times, the persons on top of the list got their 4-5 hours to assemble their Zordak force each time, (though they needed far fewer than that this time) again same as the last 4 months no one dared to challenge the list, and both these clerics who have waited about a month and a half- two months or so to float upwards have their epics ; ) In this case, it was a cleric who belonged in one of those mid-sized guilds which ordinarily *could* take Zordak on another server only if everything broke their way and they outraced the uber guilds. The other cleric was from one of our "uber" guilds. (Since that guild didnt need to worry about competition for Zordak, they continued their usual business of raiding Velious while their cleric camped)<P>We actually had a nice flame going on our boards too from an anon poster attacking some basic rules about the list. (Link to the list is on an above post of mine if your curious) As usual, (and surprisingly if your from another server's culture where FFA on Zordak reigns) that anon poster was flamed into oblivion and was never heard from again.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Sadly, I am torn over this quest.<P>I am from a small guild made up of friends and though we are almost all 50+, we simply don't have the time nor firepower. <P>And I have this sinking feeling that eventually VI will wake up and realize that their servers are being saturated with an item which practically ends the threat of the negative effects of dying and nerf the hell out of it.<P>I want the item, not for click rez, or for stats but becuase it is my <B>[u]Epic[/u]</B>. But I don't believe it says anything about how good a cleric you are to have it. You didn't have to pick anyone's pockets, or forage anything. Nothing solo.

</FONT><HR>I understand how horrible it is to have to struggle with others for spawns, quests, whatever. <P>Believe me, I know all about it.<P>The one thing that strikes me though, is how people are begging Verant to fix this for them.<P>My opinion on this is that if camping Ragefire has turned into an ugly experience for any cleric, it is NOT the fault of Verant. Look to your left and right at the other clerics in the room, for they have made it so.<P>Yes, the spawn is uncommon, but if you fight over it, its because you have chosen to do so. We can claim that by making the spawn rare, VI forces us to stab others in the back for it. However, I find it a stretch to blame Verant for someone elses behavior.<P>Perhaps VIs game design is poor, I really dont feel like I have an opinion on that myself. But others poor design is no excuse for your own bad behavior.<P>If the other clerics there choose to act with class and defer the spawn to their seniors or even just out of politeness, that speaks volumes about them. If clerics are going to muscle their way over other clerics, then they must not know much about being clerics. Violence is not our way. The fault lies with those who disregard others, who act without class and are selfish. Verant made me do it is not an excuse.<P>Place the blame where it belongs, to the clerics to the left and right of you.

</FONT><HR>I've lived through the Ragefire camp.  I've lived through Lodizal, Stormfeather, and all the others.  It sucks, but not by design.  It's just that Verant isn't *good* enough to create a new design or *honest* enough to admit that the current design is..well..stupid.<P>Everyone playing the game deserves a shot at the prize.  That's what we pay the bucks for and that's the end of the argument.<P>But the problem is that people are just basically ****ty and have no respect for anyone else in the game.  So it doesn't matter if one person or 10 groups are there in Naggy's Lair...if someone else can screw up the works..they will.<P>As has been mentioned (and I've seen it) one Cleric's guild clears out Fire Giants, buffs up for the big fight and Crappy Guild #2 sails in hands in the pearl and takes the prize...while the original guild is just left without.<P>Are there ways to solve this?  To make the quest epic?  To give everyone a chance..but require that they work for it?  To give the little guy a shot while protecting his efforts from the big guys?<P>Sure there are.  Verant's just too damned lazy to implement it.<P>Consider this scenario (not perfect as I'm pulling it off the top of my head...take the idea..the idea).<P>We know that they can have one monster die and pop another.  It happens in City of Mist.  It happens with Ragefire himself.<P>We know some monsters just can't be killed.  Look at Drugoz in Swamp of No Hope.  He heals (no spells) every tick...faster than you can take him down.<P>We know that a monster can "check" the level of a player and banish him.  Naggy and Vox do it.<P>We know that an NPC can take an item and give an item in return.<P>So...the group clears the Fire Giants and checks to see if Naggy is up. If so..fine: You've got a Naggy raid.<P>Naggy dies and about 10 minutes after that (time to divvy up loot) the "Sweeper" spawns.  He roams from Naggy's Lair down to the drawbridge or King's Room.  He cannot be killed.  He's aggro to everything.  When he hits you, he ports anyone higher than level 0 out of the dungeon.<P>After a little while.  30 minutes, an hour, 8 hours.  The "Sweeper" despawns and POOF..all the fire giants come back!<P>Now, let's assume that Naggy isn't up.  Just the Giants.  *ONE* of those giants (in the back, in Naggy's Lair) can't be mes'd, is aggro, sees invis, etc., etc.  And when he's killed then one of two things happen:<P>1 - Zordak the Vendor spawns.  Time to get ready for your Ragefire battle.  You've got your forces there, so it shouldn't be much a problem.  Hand him the pearl, he laughs *HANDS BACK A CHARRED PEARL* and Ragefire the Dragon pops.  (more on this later)<P>2 - The Sweeper spawns and clears out the area again.<P>As for the Charred Pearl...I've had the server go down during the Ragefire fight.  I petitioned and was told "too damned bad."  So I got to do the whole quest again.  The Charred Pearl does two things:<P>1 - To claim the Flail, the Cleric must turn in the Heart *and* the Charred Pearl.<P>2 - But if things went badly and the Cleric was ripped off (server outage or other guild KS's) he can turn the Charred Pearl into Omat and get another quest Pearl to try again.<P>-----------<BR>But the important part is that the Sweeper comes along at the end of an FG / Naggy / Zordak raid and *forces* everyone out.  People can't "camp" the room because the Sweeper will keep pushing people out.  Once the area is set for an "epic struggle" they'll have to work through the Fire Giants again, thus ensuring that THEY and their guild is on hand "just in case Zordak pops."<P>Epic Struggles, everyone gets a chance, no camping, randomness, workable bottlenecks (will Zordak or the Sweeper spawn?).<P>Needs work..but a much better system in essence.<P>Lonzrick L'Amore<BR>Xev<p>[This message has been edited by Lonzrick (edited 05-19-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I am wondering if they changed (nefed) Ragefires spawn time. I was the 6th cleric on Rodcet Nife to obtain my epic, and back in "the day", we were getting one Ragefire every 24 hours - almost like clockwork. Now I see people spending days and days in Sol B farming the FG's just waiting, no praying that Ragefire would spawn.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>1. I don't see this as whining. At least not done properly. I read threads on Whineplay that were whiny but I don't see any real whining here. These are legitimate problems. If other classes were complaining about these same thing I don't think people would call it whining.<P>It never ceases to amaze me how when we ask for even the most trivial things it's always "stop whining". Some issues people seem to think we whined about...<P>Cleric Quest armor (too hard and too low in AC)<BR>DA/DB still allowing us to be stunned<BR>MoK (nerfed to useless)<BR>any expansion cleric BP nerf<BR>any mana regen requests (ie standing med)<P>There are people who seem to think we're just fine as-is and that "rocking the boat" would get us nerfed. Well, we didn't rock the boat and we got nerfed anyways. Other people rocked it for us. Now people are saying that if we keep pushing it we'll get the stick nerfed too.<P>But when exactly do you propose we ask for something to be fixed? This goes beyond the epic to the core of our class. I mean, we're not the only ones in fear of the nerf stick. Are we to allow ourselves to be Verant's doormat? The simple fact is the squeaky wheel gets the grease or replaced. The silent wheels just grind along, never mentioning anything until they totally fail. Rayne has always stood for cleric issues because we are the silent class for the most part. I, for one, will not sit by and watch us get brushed off.<P>2. The bulk of the fighting over Ragefire is NOT cleric vs cleric. In fact, I had some rather pleasant exchanges with fellow clerics while proceeding along the quest myself. The problem is, it's guild vs guild. While some guilds feel it's required, it most certainly is NOT and saying so to Verant WILL get it nerfed. Look at the track record here, people. Manastones, MoK... whether or not people were requiring them was irrelevant. Verant throught they were and that's all that was needed.<P>The problem is it's desirable period. It's the best cleric weapon in the game and one of the best stat items you can get. Regardless of how common it is, it's a status symbol. EM is common as crap now but it's also a rite of passage. Wearing the Holy Armor of Barney(tm) shows you have gone to a rough place and toughed it out to some extent because you HAVE to have a raid to get it. EM is still wanted by half the clerics on the server because it's good armor. All this despite Donal's and Velious offering better. The epic is no different. Heck, it could proc True North and there would still be fights over it. It looks unique and it has excellent stats. Why do you think guilds go after lesser epics with such fervor? <P>I mean, I don't see shamen using theirs a whole lot but we spent time getting them theirs. I can't say I want mine any more than a shaman wanted his/hers. Theirs looks good too and offers exceptional stats. Who cares about the effect? We got them just the same.<P>Getting back to my original point... CLERICS generally don't fight over Ragefire. Cleric's GUILDS fight over them. I've actually been in tells with other clerics while fights raged around us. We were all shaking our collective heads at the mess. Because it wasn't JUST the cleric that lost, it was the GUILD.<P>Ragefire is no different than, say, the Dain, Cazic Thule, Yelinak, Trakanon, VS or any other uber spawns that often are contested. If CT ONLY dropped the cleric helm, would it meant that fights over Cazic would be caused by clerics too? Would it be a "cleric issue"? Would it be on OUR shoulders to fix? Of course not. Likewise, it's absurd to imply Ragefire fighting is caused and/or solved by clerics. 99% of the time it isn't. I seriously doubt most clerics out there have that kind of control. Apply your "you should be calm and rational and not fight" sentiments to Burgurgle and Gimblox. Those are places where the clerics are in total control. And yet, most of the time there is peaceful resolution there...<P>So yes, it's not Verant's fault. But seldom is it ours either. Verant's attitude is fitting, really. It's the same attitude they've had towards in-fighting all along.<P>3. Lists are a house of cards. All you need is a pearl, a willing guild and the attitude of "I need this more than they do" and it all comes crashing down. I'm glad newer servers don't seem to have this problem but I fear it is only a matter of time...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I disagree with you Boanerges.<P>Clerics fight over Ragefire. This is something we have done to ourselves. Guilds to not fight over it for one simple reason: A Cleric has to turn in a pearl to make him spawn.<P>No matter how many hotheads or doodz might be in any guild, that cleric whose guild has run over a bunch of other people has to walk up to that NPC and hit the trade button.<P>No one can force that cleric to do that.<P>Those clerics who do that are doing so of their own free will.<P>If they feel they are "forced" by their guild to do it, then that says something about them.<P>ANY cleric can stop their guild from running over any other cleric simply by refusing to turn in their pearl.<P>If they run over other clerics on their way, the greed is on them. <P>------------------<BR><B>Alliliel Archfalcon</B><BR>Cleric of Tunare<BR><A HREF="http://www.kriegeronline.com" TARGET=_blank>Krieger</A><BR>57 Seasons of Loyal Service to Tunare</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Sorry Allilie, but i agree with Boanerges.  High level guilds in the 55+ range want their clerics to be able to cast manaless rezzes.  It takes too long for a party to recover from a wipeout without a manaless rez.  Face it, if you reach level 55, you have paid your dues and Verant needs to wise up to this fact.  Customers don't want to waste an hour or 2 recovering from a wipeout.  This is where manaless rezzes shine.  A simple solution would be for Verant to introduce other cleric only items in the game (usable only by 56+ clerics) that have the same effect but are less desireable than the water sprinkler (like maybe some of the MANY nerfed cleric armor items).  The line for the water sprinkler would evaporate over night.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/006222-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006222&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=006222&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
