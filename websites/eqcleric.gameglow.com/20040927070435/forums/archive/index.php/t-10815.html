<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">03-19-2001, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't spent too much time in Velious yet. When I do go I often end up in places where faction isn't important (Frozen Shadow for kicks, Velk's for xp).<br />
<br />
I did spend some time in Icewell Keep killing dorfs, however, enough to make me KoS (although probably not heavily so). I am indifferent to frost giants and dubious to storm, and last I checked was KoS to Tormax still.<br />
<br />
Here's my dilemna:<br />
<br />
I would like to eventually go for some pieces of the Kael quest armor and do other giant quests. But eventually I will probably want to switch to dorf/dragon faction for quest and travel purposes.<br />
<br />
Is it possible with enough faction adjustments for me to get high factions with the dorfs even after I go heavily KoS with them? Is there a point of no return on Velious factions? Is a negative faction hit greater than or equal to a positive faction hit on most mobs? Are there any known ways of adjusting your faction radically in one direction or another?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I will say that you can get some insane changes in velious factions with heads it seems.<br />
<br />
Pass in them dwarf heads to Capt Bevellos, I think for the best faction. (I hear his +faction hits are better than the Kromrif recruiter guy)<br />

No matter how much faction work you do you will always be kos to a mob.<br />

Kael and Skyshrine armor quest people are on Tormax and Yelinak faction respectively, as far as I know.</div></div><hr />

Hunted Skyshrine for a bit and am rethinking my choice of factions due to guild and personal preference.</div></div><hr />

She hunted Dragons for a while then has decided to go the enlightened path to positive Yelinak faction.  It has been real hard work for her to get out of KoS standing.  But she was at threateningly as of yesterday so there is hope!<br />

I haven't hunted dragons at all, just dwarves... haven't taken too many Dain hits either it at all (I don't remember any). So far the only +Tormax faction I got was from killing Velk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
  It should also be noted that any with sneak skill, can complete the quests with only dubious faction (Since they can get back there, and get indifferent with sneak)<br />
<br />
  First rumor is unchecked, second is fact, and has been done a few times.<br />
