I receive a tell from DREWID [ANON]<br />
(i know he's a druid because I've seen him before)<br />
He says, can I get a res for 300p.  <br />
I say , WHERE?<br />
He says, PERMAFROST, I can PORT YOU.<br />
I say, It's really not enough money for me to take so much time out right now and I'm doing a corpse recovery.<br />
He says, &quot;Plz,...I can port&quot;<br />
I say, &quot;can't right now&quot;<br />
He's ok with that.  So I do the recovery and head to upper guk to possibly log for the night.  I give him another tell, &quot;Still need that res?&quot;<br />
He says, YES, but how much is it going to cost me?<br />
I say, 300p like you said.<br />
He says, Oh..ok, nm then.<br />
<br />
I just thought that was odd.  He did an &quot;Indian Give&quot; to me or something like that.  Not really a rant, just some idle gibberish to post for 5min cuz i'm bored at work right now...<br />
