<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Komari</div><div class="date">05-18-2004, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nightfall of Norrath is currently looking for level 60+ players to expand its family. <br />
<br />
We are an East Coast guild primarily, and raid from about 8pm est to 12 am est, about 4 or 5 days per week. <br />
<br />
While we are a family type guild and do not require our members to attend any of our raids, the vast majority of us DO raid because its fun and not because it is required. As such, we are looking for more people that love raiding and are able to raid with us during the times listed. <br />
<br />
The only character related requirements we have is that u be lvl 60 or very close to it and like to raid. Aside from that, we are looking for individuals with good reputation, ie no history of training and ksing; as well as people that enjoy this game for its content as much as getting loot. <br />
<br />
New members will have an evaulation period of 1 month and 10 raids before they can ask for loot (of course rot loots dont count and we often have them). That is done to make sure you fit well in our family and that you like us enough to stick around. All of your raids will be counted though, so as soon as month passes (assuming u raided 10+ times) you will be made a full member. Your raid count will not start from zero. <br />
<br />
Something to note here, we really don't like guild hoppers, and ask that you use your evaluation period to consider whether you like us enough to stay. Various circumstances may make you choose to move on after that period of course, all we ask for though is that you do not plan on using us as a stepping stone from the start. NoN is a tight bunch of people that likes to have fun playing this game, and once you are a member we would like you to stay with us as we progress through everquest. <br />
<br />
Currently we raid High end Luclin content as our main focus, especially Ssra. Aside from that, if there is a mob out there that we can kill and it has upgrades for us we tend to do that at some point during the week. At the moment we are not pushing actively to get PoP flags, we mostly raid PoP for loot at this time. <br />
<br />
Loot is awarded by officers, who in turn use raid attendance software which plays a major role in their decisions. That software is accessible to all members where they can view their stats as well as stats of everyone else. <br />
<br />
Finally, we encourage you to visit our guild website, www.nightfallofnorrath.com (http://www.nightfallofnorrath.com)  and/or talk to one of our recruiting officers (Salath, Kristianae, Greaver or Alminister) for more information and whatever additional questions you might have <br />
<br />
There is a recruitment area on the website. If you would like to apply on the spot, feel free to register your character on the site (please use your character's name when you register) and post your application. One of our recruitment officers will contact you ingame ASAP.</div></div><hr />
