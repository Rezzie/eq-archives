<br />
Since we are ranting on another forum here and this is off the topic of that one, I thought I should ask some opinions of other clerics out there. Is it just me or is our so called PET the most useless thing anyone on the server has? I mean wouldn't it be really awesome to run around with a pet fairy or a pet pixie even? Wizards pets are AWESOME! They dont fight but they help regen mana at an awesome rate and help with hitpoints, armor class, and many other usefull things that pertain to their class. What is VI thinking?? What are we carpenters? I have only used my pet &quot;hammer&quot; twice and that was just to see what use it actually was. First of all it costs 600 mana per cast and is only mob targetable, worst of all it DIES when the mob you target dies. HOW usefull is that to us really? I think all of us should unite and email what we really think our pet should be. I dont mean it should be the most uberistic pet in the game but come on it should at least be useful in some way. Sometimes it's difficult to get to certain places to res people or to run places you need to get to alone. At least give us a pet somewhat beneficial even if we can't control it like the enchanter pet class. Am I ranting or do others out there feel the same way I do?<br />
Thanks for your eyes and ears all and for your time.<br />
<br />
Hugs,<br />

Tho this is rant forum you did ask for feedback:<br />
<br />
Those familiars aren't pets any more than eye of zomm is.  Ironically, wizards do get pets identical to ours at L59, except it's a black sword and not a hammer.  It also dies when its hate list is empty just like the cleric pet.<br />
<br />
Things that many with unswerving hammer on page 50 don't know:<br />
<br />
- pets rarely get riposted now.  You can cast them in a mob's face and not worry about it dying from a riposte.<br />
- pets don't die when the initial target dies.  They die when their hate list is empty.  One pet cast on a multi-mob pull could last long enough to kill all mobs.<br />
- more recently, pets can't break mez.  So even with an enchanter you can safely send a pet in on a multi-mob pull.<br />
- you can buff your pet.  I've cast a few aegos on mine.  Which will be nice to see pet hp with the new interface.  I wouldn't suggest the pet become MT even if 1k+ hp, but you can make them pretty durable.<br />
<br />
I won't bother saying the pet is useful or not.  It's entirely how you use it like all spells.</div></div><hr />

Doing this when the first mob is at like 5% will keep your pet alive<br />
<br />
Can do this in most places, but there are some where you wouldnt wanna risk this hehe<br />
