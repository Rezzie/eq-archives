<br />
Want to try something in the new lands but it all seems too hard?<br />
<br />
Want a spot that is not crowded?<br />
<br />
Well if you are in the 35 to 45 range, there’s a spot that is calling you to hunt.<br />
<br />
Trakanon’s Teeth.  This zone in Kunark is for the 35 to 45 parties but can be decent exp for a duo at 45 or solo at 50.<br />
<br />
Trakanon’s teeth has a number of “Undead Houses” in it.  Each hut contains between 4 and 6 Spectral Keepers.  These undead range between 36 and 40th level each.  Best part?  If you use a ranged weapon/spell you can pull singles EVERY time.<br />
<br />
Spectral keepers look like lizardmen but are ghostlike, floating up a few feet off the ground and semi-transparent. <br />
<br />
If you get next to the zone to Emerald Jungle, moving to the right along the wall and you will see one of these broken down buildings with Spectrals around it.<br />
<br />
Use a spell to pull it to you our your group and have a field day.<br />
<br />
A few warnings about Spectral Keepers.<br />
<br />
They are druids.  They cast a lot.  They attack primarily with Magic, Ice and Fire spells so in weaker groups, keep up RM, RC and RF.  <br />
<br />
They buff themselves up a lot so lead off with Nullify magic or MULTIPLE cancel magics.  They will have on damage shields, Skin like Diamond and possibly more.  They have been known to rebuff during a fight.<br />
<br />
BIG NEWS: The spectral keepers exhibit an hereforeto unknown behavior in Norrath.  When they get low… THEY GATE!<br />
<br />
Yes, They gate.  Back to their spawn point.  And while you rush over to get it again they will heal themselves and be healed by others.  So be careful.<br />
<br />
I suggest either A) using stuns once it is down to 25% or B) using Dismiss Undead to “pop” it when it gets low.<br />
<br />
These things hit hard with both spell and melee damage (hits in the 90s melee) so they are no easy kill.  <br />
<br />
But they are great experience for groups that are capable of killing them.  And the fact that you can pull solos is wonderful.  There is a spot between two of these houses where a group can pull from 10 spawn points with relative ease and choose the pulls when you are ready for them.<br />
<br />
Occassionally the keepers are randomly replaced by Spectral Champions.   These are monk types that are around level 40 to 43.  They hit damned fast and hard so be ready for them.  Likely they have been buffed by the druidic keepers so dispel here as well.<br />
Another “placeholder” spawn is the Spectral Commander.  Much like a Spectral Champion, it’s a non-caster but these have been level 44 and 45. I’ve pumped approximately 4,000 damage into a Commander while the party continued to melee it with 2 warriors, a bard and a paladin and it was still alive at the end and I had to DA to let them finish it off.<br />
<br />
Despite my pointing out all of the tough aspects and scary parts, it’s a GREAT spot to hunt.  No camping, no worries.  A zone nearby.  Plenty for a party or a duo to do.  Lots to pull. I highly recommend it for those who like to get away from it all and relax with a few friends in an otherwise empty zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelric</div><div class="date">05-01-2000, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are the factions associated with killing these specs?  I'm not one to usually ask, but the factions is Kurnak are a pain for those of us of darker path.  For those that don't know we've been excluded from Karnors, Kaesora, and I hear Howling teeth.  Killing mobs in these area result in lose of faction with Venir Sathir (sp?), that's attached to mobs at the dock.  I'll stop here before this turns into a full blown rant.  For those that use the dock in Overthere, beware of the faction hits for the mobs, a few hours will drop you to KoS fast.  It might be helpful to start posting the faction, if any, attached to the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ofbac</div><div class="date">05-01-2000, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No faction at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomma</div><div class="date">06-29-2000, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know exactly where your talking about.  Its not bad.  We generally pull to the EJ zone, when hunting Hunters &amp; Foragers for Old Seb keys.  We'd pull these in the interrim.<br />
<br />
I was planning on trying this out Solo at 44, once I get Banish.  Was figuring on Root, Stun, Banish, Stun Banish, until dead.  re-root as required.<br />
<br />
They don't seem very magic resistant.  Hitting for full dmg most of the time, &amp; force/HM hitting, too.<br />
