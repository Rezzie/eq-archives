I did find, however, that the Steamfont Mountains, right after you zone there from Lesser Faydark, has some REALLY nice skeletons that con white most of the times.  Not to mention the plague rats and the pumas.  All varying levels (and most con blue or white).  So...another place to hunt.</div></div><hr />

Each spawn is far away from each other and thus can be solo'ed without too much difficulty.  It's also a nice change from the evercamped chessboard.  <br />
<br />
And the cool part is that the mino lord never runs that direction, so you're relatively safe while you med and such.</div></div><hr />
