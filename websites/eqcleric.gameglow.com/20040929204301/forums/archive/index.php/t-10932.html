I need him for my epic, but not sure my guild can just storm the place successfully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">veenublue</div><div class="date">03-06-2002, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it with two groups recently, mostly 56-60. We had two monks, which used their eyes (that were agro at the time) to pull guards, and then king to the hallway. No CH rotation, he is relatively easy once you get him alone.<br />
<br />
The safe hall is not so safe anymore. We also had two enchanters so this was easy to charge.<br />
<br />
Just remember NO PETS. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phalia</div><div class="date">03-06-2002, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We did it just the other night with 3 groups.  We only had one chanter, but we charged our whole way there.  We had a couple of bad moments..5 people fell into the pit and died.  And a necro was goofing off, made a pet, and lo and behold the King comes charging in.  Thank goodness we were (almost) ready for him!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Islington</div><div class="date">03-08-2002, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wanted to toss out something other than &quot;I just did it with myself and a level 3 bard&quot; posts.  If you haven't been to Chardok for the King yet, take your time.  Personally I suggest about 4 or 5 groups (You need a Rogue, an Enchanter or two, a couple of Warriors, a couple of Clerics, and a Monk puller really helps).  <br />
<br />
The repop in Chardok is fairly fast (about 6 - 10 minutes before the castle and then it's a 25-30 minute repop) so you need to be able to kill things fast and move on.<br />
<br />
Patience is a virtue here.  Rushed pulls will, inevitably, train you.  Let the pullers take there time and learn the pulls, especially if you haven't been here before.<br />
<br />
Once you reach the Library, I suggest turning off all Bard songs.  I've seen some crazy aggro here due to Bards and their songs.  There is a false floor on the right side of the library hall leading to the old Herbalists room.  If someone falls down here, they're dead.  If they have Bard song on when they fall, you are all dead.<br />
<br />
Chain aggro is a nightmare here.  It is VERY possible to aggro something in the library and have the aggro pass along to every single Sarnak from the Library to the Queen's room, thus causing a 40+ Sarnak train which includes the King and Queen.  Once again, patience is a virtue.  Take your time to learn the pulls and learn the aggro.  Once you know you have it, then you can go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">03-08-2002, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been to the royals a few times myself and it has always ended up in necros and coffins - problems include:<br />
<br />
1. Only 1 snarer, L52 ranger trying her very best. Did a hell of a job but she missed 1 in the library.<br />
2. Lag, we had 5 or 6 gropus, some perhaps too low for this.<br />
4. Too low levels - especially enchanters need to be at least 55+. In fact, don't go there with people below 54.<br />
5. Miss a CH or 2 due to lag or broken/resisted mez and end of party, especially if your MA/SA goes down and the rest is included in #4.<br />
6. To few &quot;real&quot; damage dealers. If you can't take down the mobs fast enough they will repop on you/king will CH a few times etc. etc.<br />
7. Have more than 1 rogue. It sucks to get trapped behind a locked door with a dead rogue on the other side.<br />
8. If people start getting summoned or a lona sarnak pops to beat the crap out of a person, relog. Odd aggro will happen there.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if you can live with that I would say royals are superb training grounds for raiding. Next time we will try AE the whole darn thing apart if we get the forces required  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
<br />
Having mules or alts camped at zonein with coffins and a deal with a necro in velious robe is a good thing /nod.<br />
