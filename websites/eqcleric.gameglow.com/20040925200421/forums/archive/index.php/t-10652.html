<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rauntek2</div><div class="date">02-19-2001, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent four or five months away from the<br />
EQ, finally have affairs enough in order<br />
to see if I can ever get past 37.. but it<br />
seems the only post here in the last <br />
several months is for a Velious thingy...<br />
and since I never really got over to Kunark,<br />
I hadn't picked up the new expansion...<br />
So, do I go back to soloing undead  frogs<br />
right at the Lower guk border, or is there<br />
something for a cleric below 39 to do?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phys</div><div class="date">02-20-2001, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go directly to Overthere - do not pass go, do not collect 200pp - go to Overthere and you will not regret it.<br />
<br />
The tower group is awesome at this level and the ledge is good to (though watch out for Goons if u are a good race).<br />
<br />
Made 6 blue bubs in 65 mins last night - NO exaggeration ! (at lvl 36).<br />
<br />
Good luck  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rauntek2</div><div class="date">02-22-2001, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the advice.. I will head<br />
that way soon. (By the way, my experience<br />
in Permafrost is that no one goes there..<br />
CT-CAN get a group, but very little exp<br />
anymore.. and Lower guk-soloing by the<br />
zone wall gets boring after a while)..<br />
And yet, I will probably stop by <br />
both of those areas running from Perma<br />
to Oasis(I assume I can jump off the boat<br />
safely..)<br />
Any other advice? Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panteroo</div><div class="date">02-22-2001, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some nice places to hunt in Kunark..<br />
<br />
The Overthere : very good experience, watch out for goons tho<br />
<br />
Burning Woods : group only. most mobs are in the late 30's on up, great experience <br />
<br />
Temple of Droga (Frontier Mountains) : Nice loot, good experience... pain in the arse to get your non-gating classes out of<br />
<br />
Velious (if you ever get it)<br />
<br />
Frozen Tower: Very good loot, great experience, can be grand central train station if people don't know what they are doing. Has a very nice cleric equipeable +wis range slot item (Teachers Syllabus)<br />
<br />
Crystal Caverns: your approaching too high a level at 37, all the orcs are green around 39 or so. Very good experience and great sellable loot. Camped there 8 hours one night at level 32 (with a group) and walked out with 10 yellow bubs of xp and a pack full of loot i sold for over 5k pp. <br />
<br />
If your going to Kunark from NRo, make sure you jump off the boat immediately upon entering OT and just swim to your left as your facing land... unless your a Dark Elf of course.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps</div></div><hr />
