We had 4 warlords, 7-8 clerics, 1 DC Enchanter and around 20 others (unfortunatly no rogues and just 1 wizard)<br />
<br />
I set up the rotation with having 5 clerics in a rotation with a 4 sec pause between casting - and the rest was on DL - Remedy duty. We made our target tank hotkey, to switch tanks when disc was gone on one tank. This worked very well.<br />
<br />
Problems we had:<br />
1. One or two clerics got aggro after the 3 tank engaged one of them died immediatly. Second some time after.<br />
2. Rezzing the tanks back fast enough.<br />
3. Adds<br />
4. Lack of dmg - output<br />
<br />
Any suggestion concerning the healing rotation - healing organisation?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">07-01-2002, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the best thing is to keep the same tank on vindi throughout the fight, just have the clerics use 3 sec delay between them.  should be more then enough to take him down.<br />
Tank changes arent really needed with good healing. 4-5 clerics are enough for rotation.  keep the rest of the clerics with tanks to heal the rampage damage.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind the location of the fight, try to fight where ye only need to worry about one add if possible.  with the dire charm chanter that really helps.<br />
<br />
And one last thing...we learn more from failures then from successes, so let yer people talk about the fight to see how they can improve.  That helps more then anything.<br />

There's a spot not far from there that you can pull him too with less potential for adds. I agree with Corynthia, just keep one tank up for the fight using a shorter interval on the heals, you should be ok.<br />

<br />
Rezzing into a Vindicator fight will NEVER work on a large scale.  He can simply kill too fast.<br />
<br />
With that many clerics (wow, that is a lot) you should be able to easily ride a single tank all the way.  At a delay of 4 seconds we don't lose our MT ever, excluding mana issues (with 4 clerics) or lag (always a problem).<br />
<br />
Make sure someone gets MoR on him.  You wouldn't believe how much extra damage it does to him.<br />
<br />
Making sure you keep one MT the whole time also deals with the chewed-up cleric effect.  Remember he has something like undead agro, so watch where you are sitting.  After that it's all positioning…<br />

<br />
As for the switching / ressing / positioning - it was the raidleader's order. I got the feeling, we could have kept the maintanks much longer alive - since we are are a quite good cleric team all in all - but on a raid, don't ask questions, do what you are told to do - especially if you don't know better  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif I will talk to him about your experiences and I am sure this will help us to kill that nasty giant next time!

<br />
I think that was your real issue =) DPS is critical with a fight like DtV...especially if you can get him down to no visable life like that....I imagine one rogue or a second wizard would have turned that loss into a victory for you.<br />

<br />
And dps seems to be key in your troubles too.<br />
<br />
That should solve any problems you have.  One thing to be careful of is make sure that chanter doesn't die or that DC'd mob = add.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Corynthia</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the DPS problem is connected to the healing..if ye loose tanks and the switch over is messy, then ye loose lots of DPS while trying to get the new tank on the mob.<br />
Thats why its best to keep one tank on Vindi the whole time, that way ye dont need to worry about tank switching(which most often kills wizards and other high agro damage dealers) but can also have straight damage output the whole time.<br />
That was the problem with the fight, not the lack of DPS  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  though i agree that more DPS would help, ye should try it with what ye have, makes the game more interesting  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seeing that health bar makes me think of one of our first attempts on King Tormax, one and a half years ago...he had no visible health for five minutes, and we had no one healthy enough to tank him. We fought him at the zone with loads of people bound there, so meleers just grabbed weapons and tried to hit him...:-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanya</div><div class="date">07-02-2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First I would make sure that melee people are on the rampage list. You have enough healing if you can keep the clerics standing. <br />
<br />
One way to do that is as Vindi is running in have a group of melee plink arrows at him so they are on the rampage list rather than a healer. Just make sure that the first warlord is out in front of the plinkers to accept the first melee. You can free up one of the cycle clerics to keep the rampage list people alive.<br />
<br />
We also don't start the first CH until the warlord is about 1 to 2 seconds from engaging. Having a CH hit after the tank has only been fighting for 3-5 seconds is rough for healer agro. We rely on all the healers except the 1st and 2nd CH cycle cleric to spam heal until the first CH hits.<br />
<br />
Having a spare cleric keep Elixir on the MA and MoR on Vindi helps too. Make sure all melee have low agro weapons until it's their turn to tank. We lost one time when warlord #2 got agro when his willsapper procced about 5 seconds into the fight.<br />
<br />
Vanya<br />
<br />
Edit: Don't forget to stack any damage shield you can. Support your shaman and have all the MA's drink a DS potion before their turn. I think mage, potion, bard and MoR all stack. With how many times Vindi hits DS damage can really add up.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apologise if any of this is obvious but here goes.<br />
<br />
We normally fight vindi by the ramp on the left side of the arena (as in outside the arena).  The pull is long but the reason for it is simple, the mobs close by are charmable - the ones in the arena are not.<br />
<br />
You can try and time it perfectly so that you will not get any adds during the fight, but chances are you will get some - so its best to plan for that and get your enchanters to deal with anything that adds.<br />
<br />
Vindi fight with 30 ish people should be around 3-6 mins dependant on the damage output.  Delay is highly dependant on the quality of the tank but as others have said a 4 second chain with a 3 second post defensive should be more than sufficent, with 5 clerics in the chain you should be able to survive for that amount of time without too much problems.<br />
<br />
Bard with tank group is essential - the DS + bard epic effect really help hold taunt.  As vanya said getting agro due to procing weapons is an issue however there is a way that my guild deals with that.  The primary tank is the only one to engage until he is happy that taunt can be maintained throughout the entire fight - it is not a set time as in 10 seconds or 20 seconds but a proc or two with a willsapper will let him call other people in.<br />
<br />
As with any big named rampager, you have to be very careful indeed.  You need to work on assigning rampage damage to someone and making it hit them.  Its a difficult job specially since no one seems to truelly understand rampage agro, but needless to say you have to have tank number 2 between the clerics and the MT, and make sure that someone is on rampage heal.<br />
<br />
One thing that often kills clerics is monk or any FD pulling.  As was mentioned on another thread - a monk or whatever pulling a mob into camp then promptly FD'ing is not the right idea at all.  It is probably why alot of people call for all casters to stand up, because all agro in camp is transfered onto the mob if its hatelist suddenly becomes empty. <br />
<br />
A way round this, especially with agressive healing mobs is monk tanking at the start.  The monk pulls and runs to where the MT is, hits stone stance and starts bashing it silly.  Whilst the MT is doing likewise.<br />
<br />
During this time the monk recieves no healing whatsoever.  When the monk feels it prudent to FD, he does so and agro transfers onto the warrior.<br />
<br />
Control the agro so that all melee hits are on the MT, all rampages are on the assigned person, and that pops/roamers are controlled via charm and you should be ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">07-03-2002, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) vindi agro is close to 100% proximity based so it dont matter if the mt has procing weapons or anything like that really - his agro is exatactly like an undead mob - it will attack the closest target unless someone else has *really* pissed him off &amp; even then, transfering agro back is very easy for anyone with half a brain.  Making sure everyone attacks from behind at max range will keep everyone alive more effectively than anything else.<br />
<br />
2) There is no reason to worry about healing agro cause there is none (although a cleric can sometimes get on the rampage list which = bad obviously, but thi seems to happen extremely rarely - i've only seen it once &amp; vindi stomped the cleric &amp; we just tightened the chain up hehe).  We wiped out a lot early on because we were starting the chs too late - so naturally we over compensated &amp; on our 1st several vindi kills we would start the rotation so long before the mt was engaged that like 2+ chs would land before vindi came down the ramp even  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
<br />
3) After cripple is in he wont rampage very often.  Assign a cleric to the tank who is getting rampaged &amp; it is easy to deal with.<br />
<br />
4) Dont bother switching tanks - its harder than just speeding up the ch rotation &amp; my personal opinion is it takes more mana cause the fight becomes much longer due to the loss of damage during the switch.<br />
<br />
5) Dont bother trying to work battle rezes into your tactics - vindi plows through people too quick for this to be viable.  If a few people die early in the fight &amp; there is an extra cleric with an epic, go ahead &amp; drag &amp; rez them, but dont put any emphasis on it.<br />
<br />
btw, you've got the tactics down to kill him if you can get him under like &lt;85%, which you obviously have done - the *only* thing you need to do is add dps or extra cleric mana (mod rods, another cleric, necro whatever) &amp; you will kill him np.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gallerus, it is entirely possible to agro vindi onto you due to lack of agro by the MT, as others have said non main tanks have got agro with lucky (or should that say unlucky) string of procs with weapons such as epics, willsapper or anything like that.  It can and does happen, and will normally mean lights out to whoever gets agro.  <br />
<br />
Vindi doesn't agressively agro healing when you stand up, but meditating whilst will not get you melee agro will definitely put you on the rampage list - which is exactly what you wish to avoid, since it only takes one quad 700 to put most clerics into frenzy range and you will typically get summoned.<br />
<br />
Starting the chain early is not a bad thing.  All it means is that CH's are incoming to the MT at a set time - there is no rule that you have to follow through with those CH's.  Warping can cause an issue I must admit, but in zones or situations where warping will not occur, you can judge the need for the CH to hit simply by looking around.  You can go through 2 cycles of CH's and not use any mana (other than that lost in fizzles), but if the named does suddenly appear, the tank shouldn't die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gallerus</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been in the ch rotation for vindi &amp; statue at least a dozen times with my cleric &amp; since he is only lvl 55, i've sat down to med every fight - never gotten on the rampage list.<br />
<br />
My guild has 12-14 lvl 60 warriors and I think last I counted 11 have epics/willsapper/better &amp; they generally all attack immediatly after vindi is positioned &amp; I dont think I can remember the last time that one of them has died due to unlucky weapon procing /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">07-04-2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cleric who gets on the rampage list typically is the one whose heal first hits, at 55 your cleric is very unlikely to lead the chain, hence the chance of agro going to you is substancially reduced or elimanted.  Having another tank between you and the critter does reduce the chance of rampage agro - but not completely elimanate it. <br />
<br />
Must admit its been a while since I last did vindi, healing agro is minimul but not zero, i remember numerous tormax raids (who is very similar to vindi but just longer with slightly less dps) whereby I could med throughout the entire fight, whereas other clerics got rampaged on and slammed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a Cleric Channel and in that we bring in our thoughts and make the tactics for the healing. We decide if we need a 3.5 second CH chain or a 2 second CH chain and which cleric is in chain and which one takes the other jobs.<br />
<br />
When were done we tell the Raid Leader the result and he will built the groups around that plan.<br />
<br />
When the CH-Chain is running well you do not need to switch the tanks. Maybe youre CH-chain has to change the timing when disci wears off but not more.</div></div><hr />

While everyone else is bickering pointing fingers in the main channel, clerics have usally sloved the problem already  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
That bein said, don't have a &quot;I'm a cleric you can't tell me what to do&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
Just about every cleric who even attempts to talk stratagy in the cleric channel has been on enough raid to know what'll work and what won't.<br />

THAT being said, you CAN NOT under any circimstance allow someone who doesn't know what their doing lead yall.  It won't work  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Oh, and Dez is right, I was the 2nd to last tank before vinidi droped, was a great fight we had like 23 people for the fight and we were all dead tired from raiding al day  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif 2 clerics and a monk lived, was classic  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
