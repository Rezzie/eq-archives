<br />
WHERE are they? Having to go to every raid every night because it seems like none of the other clerics show up is quickly burning me out.<br />
<br />
Do any other high-end alliance/guilds have this problem? Or am I just reaaallly hitting an unlucky streak here?<br />
<br />
I can't complain--my alliance has been really good to me...but checking the schedule Sunday night and finding out you're suddenly booked until next week gets a little discouraging..../cry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cosmos7777</div><div class="date">08-08-2001, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the other clerics in your guild may prefer running a warrior alt or something during those raids.  You may not know, in a big guild, which alt belongs to which cleric.<br />
<br />
In my opinion (as a 56 cleric), raids are a lot of work, stress, and expense for clerics, without a lot of fun and reward, and if someone's primary character is a cleric, and if that primary is the only character they have that is high enough level to go on raids, then they will attend as a cleric.  <br />
<br />
But if they have a primary or alt that is not a cleric that is big enough for raiding, they will generally prefer to go in that non-support role.  I believe it is less exhausting, less expensive, and more enjoyable to swing a sword on a raid than be a healing dispenser.<br />
<br />
Just a theory, of course, but if you had the option to go as a warrior, paladin, rogue, monk, or non-cleric caster, would you?  I would be tempted, myself, because except for enchanters, it would have to be rather easier and more fun to do so.  <br />
<br />
As a meleer, you've no buffing to think about, no need to stare at the health bars without daring to blink, no reagent costs, no problems taking a restroom break, no medding, no mana worries, no reporting heals, no guilt if the tank dies, etc.  <br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion: when a raid is planned, show up fashionably late.  Chances are someone else will get pressed into duty (complaining all the way, no doubt) as a cleric because the guild will figure you can't attend.  Flush those hidden clerics out of the woodwork.<br />
<br />
After you've done a little &quot;flushing&quot;, don't be surprised if the person who replaced you quickly asks to switch to an alt &quot;now that you've shown up.&quot;</div></div><hr />
