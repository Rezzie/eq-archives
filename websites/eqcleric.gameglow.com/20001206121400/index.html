The following changes were made:<br><br>- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or below the minimum.<br>- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.<br>- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified whenever the volume slider was moved.<br>- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association with mipmapping.<br>- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong slot.<br>- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried by dwarves. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience in slight disagreement with the server.<br>- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.<br>- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable. <br></blockquote></p>

<blockquote>
I personally think it was a joint plot between Gameglow and my wife.  Gameglow wants updates, and my wife is out of town and is enjoying my not being able to play.  Ok, maybe they had nothing to do with it, so while browsing I came across our new Velious spells.  They are:<br><ul><li>Armor of Protection, Level 34, Self only AC/Hitpoint buff (+15 AC, +225 hit points, 110 mana)</li><li>Turning of the Unnatural, Level 39, DOT vs Undead (400dmg, 180 mana)</li><br><li>Celestial Healing, Level 44, short duration (4 ticks) group regen (744 healed, 200 mana)</li><br><li>Improved Invisibility to Undead, Level 50, Fixed duration ITU (10 min, 75 mana)</li><br><li>Word of Stunning, Level 55, AE Stun (low radius, low resist, 9 second duration, 150 mana, 45 sec recast)</li><br><li>Aegolism, Level 60, upgrade to Heroism, group HP/AC buff (1100 hps, 54 AC, 900 mana, 1 peridot)</li></ul><br><br>I have to admit that I'm pretty excited about a few of those spells.  Aegolism is the best answer I've seen to why a Cleric wants to hit level 60.  It's a group Heroism/Marzin rolled into one.  And with Marzin stacking with it a level 60 Cleric can add 1800 hit points to group members.  1800!!!  That, my friends, is a LOT of hit points.<br><br>Word of Stunning is another very nice spell.  Ever find yourself or your group surrounded by a lot of mobs and wondering what you would do once your Div wore off?  Slap a stun on the lot of them.  Also gives us another tool when the Wizards and Enchanters decide to play "nuke em all."  A specialized spell to be sure, but one that I think will find some use.<br> <br>I remember feeling a bit of chagrin when I saw that Wizards were getting ITU.  Then I saw what ours does.  Wizards can have our castoff.  This makes our spell the best invis in the game, albeit ITU isn't used too much (alas).  Still, there are places that are strictly undead (e.g. deep in the Hole).  It's somewhat comforting that in those rare situations where I'll need to toss it I'll know it will work.<br><br>Group Celestial Heal and Turning of the Unnatural are the last two new spells.  Group Celestial Heal has an incredible HPs healed/Mana ratio (3.72:1).  Granted it's over 24 seconds, but it still has the best ratio available to Group Complete Heal.  It's another nice tool.  Turning of the Unnatural is the only spell I find a bit dissappointing.  It's ratio is only marginally better than Expel and it takes 96 seconds for its full effect to be reached.  I'm not sure why I would use this spell instead of casting Expel twice.<br><br>And finally, Armor of Protection.  A buff just for me =).  See, Verant knew I was getting close to 1k AC and wanted to help me out.  As a bonus all the other Clerics get it too.  Ok, dementia aside another 15AC/225 hit points is great.<br><br>Of course, these spells are not final and may change before (and after) Scars of Velious is released.<br><br>Regardless, I'm looking forward to our new spells.  Aegolism is enough to spur me to 60.</blockquote></p>
