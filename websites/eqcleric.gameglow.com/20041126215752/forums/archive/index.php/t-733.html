What do most clerics complain about?  Yes we're one dimensional...not that argument.  The fact that we sit 99% of the time on our butts doing nothing...other than entertaining our groups in groupsay.<br />
<br />
How about 50+ clerics get the ability to regen mana at the same rate while standing, as they do while sitting?<br />
<br />
Comments please!  Not an original idea, but I've always like this one  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Man that would be nice I could get in there and swing a lot more - but all those time I yelled Nerf necros would come back to haunt the cleric class if we got something this unbalancing  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

And if we could get mana back standing as good as sitting, then you could add that back to the class( at higher levs in group combat of course). Of course we couldnt do near the damage of pure mele, or even the bastard classes, but we could use that armor and weopons we worked hard for.<br />

<br />
And with ALL the classes supporting it there might be some chance of it going through rather than the divided approach that ends up with folks feeling unfairly done by and sabotaging the clericly push for Fewer Flat Bottoms.<br />

<br />
There was at one time, a comment made by Abashi that told a particular cleric that if he were to find something that might make being a cleric more fun but not upset the class balance that he would love to hear it.  This, IMO, is the answer.  No longer do we have to sit on our butts, we can actually swing our sticks!  This is about the only thing that I can think of that could be implemented that's not balance upsetting, but would go a long way in improving what many people feel is a &quot;boring&quot; job.<br />

<br />
I disagree, as the caster class (supported by a roleplaying perspective) that was 'meant' to melee was the shaman.  Compared to clerics, they come from strong, large races, and they have some really nice heavy hammers.   This is of course reflected in the game by shaman having their 1HB and 2HB caps 20 points higher than clerics or druids.<br />
<br />
Clerics should have 0 melee damage output, and frankly, I hope it stays like this.  If people want a front-line healing character, they should roll up a paladin.  I don't want a fancy weapon that procs this, or has an amazing damage/delay ratio.  I'd rather have a large assortment of very cool holy armor which adds to our defensive ability.<br />

 WHAT? That idea itself...not you...IS Moronic.<br />
 Clerics are battle priests ladd/lass. BEFORE DURING AND AFTER.<br />
 Read some fanstasy novels, read old D&amp;D books, heck in Tolkien Wizards wielded swords. At least gandalf did.<br />
<br />
 Saint Cuthbert comes to mind too...<br />
<br />
 Hammer, Mace, staves, and sometimes axes, definitely daggers, priests in real life history were known for fighting, same in fantasy novels and games of the genre.<br />
<br />
 Now that was your opinion, you are entitled to it. I disagree whole heartedly about that.<br />
 I've had max attck-defense and weapon skills  for clerics in each and every level. Though I am lagging on 2hb now even at 51.<br />
 A shield is too necessary for me at this time. I need it to keep me mates alive. AC is king, because dodging at our level isn't an option.<br />
 Now for MEDDING WHILE STANDING YES...as long as you aren't moving or in actual combat it might work...but then running while medding is a zen thing neh?<br />

<br />
First, this whole point is moot, since clerics will NOT be gaining any increase in melee ability (ie, we will never be able to hit the broad side of a barn).   Second, if they did, it would tempt some clerics to actually stand up and try to swing their weapon instead of sitting and medding.   And when I play my monk, and if I'm grouped with a cleric who is spending time melee'ing, I try to find another cleric =p<br />
<br />
Cleric meleeing is just an inefficient way to play the class, unless you have some uber proc'ing weapon that actually does damage.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is not necessarily true.  Last night I was grouped with a 55 ogre warrior, 53 ogre warrior, 54 barb shaman, 54 wizard, me and 56 enchanter in Chardok.  The shaman was slowing mobs, and the 2 warriors were tanking.  With Clarity 2 on and slowed mobs, we were all able to goof off and have fun.  I equipped my yakesha war mace and the shaman cast his dex buff on me and I went to town on the mobs.  Several times during the fight I actually was doing enough damage to draw the attention of the mobs to myself (when you proc yakesha 7 times in a row on them, it tends to piss them off).  So by saying that cleric melee is worthless and we should do 0 melee damage is rediculous.  I would estimate that I did probably 300 to 400 of pure melee (not yakesha proc damage) in that fight alone.  Granted it's nowhere near what the warriors were doing (probably did 400 points in 2 or 3 rounds), but it still was fun and there was no danger in what I was doing.  I would not do this in most normal situations, but in this situation, it was ideal and we all had a good laugh about it.<br />

A meleeing cleric at 50+ is hurting his party more than he's helping, since he's wasting valuable med time.  If we could med while standing though this would NO LONGER be the case.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you all, but I think it would be a refreshing change of pace  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalur</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can med while standing up.  It's called clarity II.  Let me tell ya, it rocks.<br />
<br />
That in addition to Shaman slow spell, and essentially you have a lot of time on your hand to do what's fun.  Melee, nuking some and so forth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rudo</div><div class="date">08-03-2000, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always thought that the mana regen for med should be less. This could be balanced by increasing the natural (standing) mana regen.<br />
<br />
I want to be tempted to swing my mace. I want the wizard to be tempted to swing a staff. Magicians are described as warrior mages and I would like to see a viable concept of a magician who does a lot of melee and rarely sits to meditate.<br />
<br />
Sure these ideas aren't efficient but right not they aren't even viable. I'll sacrifice some efficiency to be able to play the concept that I want to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And with clarity 2 on, you probably could have med back the mana on 2 650 damage nukes in this time.  <br />
<br />
The situation you were in was quite controlled (ie, every mob being slowed, and seemed like a pretty well rounded group) so you had a lot of slack to goof off.   However, lets say the situation you and your group were in was very hectic, and mana was not plentiful.   Would you be standing up and swinging your mace?   Nope, you'd be sitting down medding, because it's a lot more efficient for a cleric to do compared to meleeing, even with your ykesha mace.<br />
