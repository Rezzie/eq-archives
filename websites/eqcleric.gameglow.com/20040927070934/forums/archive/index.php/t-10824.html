<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Havusin</div><div class="date">03-26-2001, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious how other guilds are handling Talendor, I find him to be a fun/interesting dragon to hunt, so I thought I would share what I know so far, as well as post a few questions.<br />
<br />
First of all, resists, I dont know...this is beginning to confuse me more and more.  Yesterday, for the first time in a while, i had a bard grouped with me.  My MR was 308, FR 290.  At level 57, with resists this high, I still was only resisting about one in 3 waves of either fear or the dot.<br />
<br />
The dot.....its fire based as a check, and I didnt bother trying to cure it.  I did not have word of restoration on me....sigh, left it in bank and dinged right before the raid. Will this spell clear the DoT?  <br />
<br />
Basically we went with a &quot;one taunter&quot; method, my group had two clerics, 3 level 60 warriors, and a bard.  We &quot;focused&quot; on one tank at a time, and let them try to maintain aggro until they fell. Considering the lag, I was using Divine Light, even tho I hate the spell, and was chain casting  hero to (try and) keep everyone alive from the dot.  Problem with this was that I noticed when the dragon was at about 50%, I was only hitting half of my party members with hero because of the fear....wasted mana.  Yet if I were to take the time to DL each member, I probably would have had my tanks dropping faster.  Any pointers from anyone else on this?<br />
<br />
I died from....surprise!...melee damage. Sigh, since the healing aggro change, the only way I have died vs a dragon is to meleee....neat. /smirk.  Anyone else having lots of problems with this as well?<br />
<br />
On a side note, the dragon did drop...had 3 bard items and some spells  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  He even dropped Aegis, which I had never seen.<br />
<br />

His DoT is a fire-based resist that can be annulled. Word of Restoration never removed it in my experience. The Celestial line sticks over the fire DoT.<br />

<br />
I have been on 2 Talendor killings so far, so still learning a lot.<br />
<br />
I wanted to make one comment though I am not sure if it is true or not but it appears that after you get to 200 on any resists it seems almost useless or your resist rate gets worse. I have seen numerous threads about resists post 200 and from my own experience with resists above 200. When I had a MR at 265 I failed fear 2 of 3 times and went running. With a MR of 178 I was only feared 1 of 3 times.<br />
<br />
The only way I was able to get rid of the Fire based DoT was to annul it.<br />
<br />
Would be interesting to hear others opinions on the resists or further testing.<br />

<br />
Absor/Alan someone said that this was not the case.<br />
<br />
Yet I would still like to hear what people's actual experience with MR at sub 200, sub 255, and 255+ have been.<br />

<br />
Ran PR/MR at 230(ish) each.<br />
<br />
Resisted everything.<br />
<br />
I dont think Im going to cross 255 again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">03-27-2001, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There does seem to be some kind of bug when a bard is playing a selo's drum with the resist songs. For instance, one raid vs Gerenaire and Tal, MR 330 with bard using a selo's drum, the entire level 59-60 group gets repeatedly feared and hit with the AEs. Next raid same group, same levels, but bard not using selo's drum, one group member gets feared, most DoTs resisted, our resists were still in the 300 range. *shrug*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nasren</div><div class="date">03-29-2001, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is an answer to the resist debate but I guess that still makes me wonder how Dragon breath attacks are resisted, if your resist gear doesn't make a difference or the type of resist for the type of breath makes no difference then what does?<br />
<br />
This comes from Ester the Tester off the new boards.<br />
<br />
This issue has come up before, but I never saw an answer. There is a widely held perception (especially in very powerful guilds) that resists over a certain amount (the amount cited varies, but usually above around 220) are considered to be more harmful than good. I have particular interest in this as a bard, as resists is one of the few things that I offer powerful guilds on big raids. <br />
<br />
As anecdotal evidence that this perception may be true, on a trakanon raid I recently attended, I was in a caster group. Four of us in the group had 210-250 poison resist with my songs up. The other two were testing this theory, and left theirs at around 180 with my songs. After Trakanon fell, we compared notes, and all four of us with 210+ PR got poisoned. The two that had the lower resists did NOT get poisoned.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this is a small sample size, and could just be strange luck, but it concerns me that it is a widely held perception, and would like a statement that it has been tested and is in fact false, or it's been tested, and true, and we're fixing it.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />

The perception is indeed false. The problem is that the saves against dragon weapons are different than the saves in the rest of the game. With a resist that would make you basically involunerable against a 'normal' (ie non dragon) MOB a dragon is going to be able to still hurt you.<br />
<br />
Most of the time people max out their resists only when fighting mobs of this level, so I understand where the perception comes from. However we have tested this and the stats and they do not roll over.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No real strategy needed, we just lay the smack down on him. Unless you are trying to kill him with only 18 people or something, he shouldn't live long enough for strategy to matter much.<br />
<br />
As for getting agro - I always keep both DA and DB memmed, I can always get DA off and sometimes DB too but I rarely have to use it except on long fights.<br />
<br />
His dot is nasty but I wouldnt worry about it until after the fight, it doesn't kill fast enough to affect things I think.  Just pump those Word of Health greaves hard or dispell it or do something other than shout &quot;anyone got mana to heal my tank?&quot; until it wears off.<br />

However, after my own testing with Severilous last night, I'm completely convinced beyond doubt that resists roll after after 255. First attempt mr/pr were both over 300, the only spell I resisted was a fear, which was after I had died and come back, full equipment, but buffless. Next attempt I tweaked my gear/bard songs so my mr was 233 and pr 253, resisted about 50% of the stuns and 70% of the fears, which is very good at my low lvl (56).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nige Willowleaf</div><div class="date">04-04-2001, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CE stacks with the dot but does not override it. Only way I have seen the dot leave is with annul. Have it up before the fight because more people die after the dragon is dead than during the fight in my experience - or at least it is a more painful death. Nothing like being awarded a loot, and dropping dead as you try to loot it. Also don't forget to check yourself for the dot - it looks just like the cold resist icon.<br />
<br />
I have found I need 3 casts of annul usually to cure the dot.<br />

Since server side filtering is up why don't you just do what some of the new and suddenly &quot;uber&quot; guilds are doing?<br />
ie. Throw 100gimps and a couple handgrenades at Mob X and then brag about your L33t k1ll :P<br />
However, if you do it the skill based way, and actually employ (gasp) tactics - GL to you and I hope you win.<br />
