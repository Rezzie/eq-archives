<br />
Also a good place to use our endure line of spells for magic, cold and fire =).<br />
<br />
Make sure you have a good group though.  This isn't a place to solo.<br />

I'm looking for a weapon to complement Bull Smasher that I can use to beat on ghouls, lurking mummies, and other magic-only creatures.  I'm over in South Karana right now, and I thought about hitting Permafrost while I'm there.<br />

<br />
If you are looking to solo him, forget it.  I see groups of 3 30-35 in there.<br />
<br />
You must have a very good puller to break up the spawn.  There are 2 gobbies in the front, 3 on the stage (preacher spawns in the center) and 3 gobbies behind the stage.<br />
<br />
If an evoker/wizard is behind the stage, they can nuke you from their spawn point.<br />
<br />
The order to take down casters are (from kill it NOW! to kill it damn soon) are:<br />
1) Diviner<br />
2) Priest<br />
3) Evoker<br />
4) Wizard<br />
<br />
make sure to break out the endure magic/cold/fire.  Stuns come in damn handy as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dawk Le' nal</div><div class="date">11-10-1999, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got level 19 and 20 here and would have gladly stayed through more but the group wanted to move after they were there 10 days prior while I was on vacation. GREAT place! We also had the preacher room to ourselves my first night in and I got a CIMS on our only preacher of the evening. Of course, I'd gladly trade this for better luck on quest armor spawns, but I was lucky that night.<br />
<br />
I was barely level 19 and I was with a 22 ranger, 21 shadow knight and 22 druid. We had very little trouble in the room the entire time and our ranger was pulling constantly from behind us to keep the escape route clear and to keep us busy. Ironically, the preacher himself went down quite easily.<br />
<br />
I agree wholeheartedly on the use of Holy Might and stun. I am embarrased to admit that I neglected this line through 18 levels as a cleric, but discovered the beauty of Holy Might against a Diviner when my group brought it down before it got of it's 2nd spell. I followed might with Smite and this along with 2 or 3 Druid dd's and whatever melee we had killed him in a hurry. Don't bother with DOT's on diviners, if you can't kill em fast enough to destroy the full potential of the DOT you can lose members in a hurry, unless there is a medicant there. The worst battles I've fought here have been with Medicants healing Diviners. <br />
<br />
Enjoy Perma,<br />

Preacher is a random spawn. Though, he gave CIMS or RC each time we killed him.<br />
If you see people in the 30s there it's for the RC, which you can trade very well (and you might wanna keep one for yourself BTW).<br />
