<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hiisi</div><div class="date">11-12-1999, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read a lot of complaints about the cleric class, having some negative emotions about them myself.. or at least Verant's portrayal and role for them.<br />
<br />
The most likely reason is that none of the programmers/head gm's played clerics on other muds before designing Norrath. Programmers, especially mud programmers, program things the most readily for the classes they love to play.  The only way that clerics will see improvements is if one of us steps up to the plate and sends in our resume to either of the positions that recently appeared in the eqnews.txt file.<br />
I'd do it, except that my experience is in DIKU programming, not LP, and I'm not familiar with Perl or CGI.  IF you are, volunteer/send in your resume.<br />
<br />
If someone at Verant happens to read this, I'd be happy to program the code for new cleric spells/skills for free.  I'm not able to relocate from Texas to California, so I doubt I'd be able to, but Im perfectly willing.<br />
<br />
The rest of this is my take on why disillusionment comes about:<br />
<br />
The first character that I ever made IMM on a mud was a dwarven cleric... guess what I play on EQ.  Naturally, comparisons are made.<br />
<br />
IF you played clerics on other muds, and read the claptrap that Verant put together on clerics, your expectation is of a substitute tanker - in game terms you should be able to take on xp-green mobs without using spells. (What are two of the stats that Verant suggests being high? Strength and Stamina - does that not suggest a fighting presence to you?)<br />
<br />
The reality in the game (and this is driven by Verant's desire to be party-centric - by making mobs incredibly, unrealistically tough for their level- actually a problem on many muds- why should 15th level elf bandits (who can backstab) be able to do 30pts of damage with their fists? when I with presumably higher str do 17 max with my mace...) is that clerics are best off with high agility and high wisdom.  Because soloing is extremely hard at some points in your career.  Because you will be grouped, your primary use will be as a healer/buffer.<br />
When you heal, you get attacked- clerics that<br />
continue to try to heal (like I do- sure I can root, but not 2 or 3 mobs at once) are only going to get off their spells with a high dodge/ac.  <br />
<br />
  Most clerics, I daresay, dont realise this until they have spent significant time in getting to the mid levels (20+), where one finds that mobs, even when you are wearing incredible armor for your level (ac 430 w/out spells at 20th)you get nailed consistently, because dodge doesnt work often enough (success seems tied to agi) and a higher str/sta has no real benefits whereas higher agi does.  That was a real disillusionment for me.. Two stats above 100, that seem to serve no point whatsoever, while the stats that did matter (agi and int) were low indeed.  There seems to have been a design flaw, an entirely unintentional one, built into clerics.  I know druids of my character's level- with similar ac's b/c of high agi, and higher offence/defence skills (higher int seems to affect how fast these skills go up). Since defense is a large factor in your end ac, this can really add up over time.  <br />
<br />
Also, I notice that my character's strength, while 20pts higher than the druid's has no real effect on weapon damage.. My maximum is the same using the same weapons as he does..<br />
the only difference it seems is that I carry 20lbs more around... oooh. (1h blunt was 88 at 20th)  As for stamina, when do more hps appear for higher stamina?  What is the minimum # to see an appreciable difference in hp's with other classes- like druids?<br />
My stamina is 101.. a druid friend's is 84.. there are fewer than 12hps of diffence between our totals... Something wrong there too.<br />
<br />
Basically, I think at one time clerics were going to the substitute tanks of the game- but then other design &quot;innovations&quot; were made and the cleric class was never updated to reflect those changes- and most likely were not because there was no advocate for them among the programming/design crew.  That's fine and dandy on a free mud- but not one that you pay for.<br />
<br />
The cleric and the druid are classes you can validly compare: what is the druid if not the priest of nature?  The sheer utility, and abilities... under the current overall design philosophy make the druids a powerlevelers dream.  And they are, at low levels, a huge source of competition for clerics- healing/buffing spells.  With unique, highly utilitarian spells such as SOW and Teleport under level 20, its easy for someone playing a cleric to wonder why there's such a difference... Who among has not wished for SOW? Lets face it, it would be nice to be able to outrun your pursuers- or to teleport across the ocean in seconds-either way (we can do it one-way) Or how about doing damage to a mob each time it hits you... it's easy to understand the jealousy people feel.. I dont understand how some people can't see that others feel this way.  We get some nice buffs.. daring/bravery- endure magic - but divine aura (with the current stun-through) rarely saves the day for me- the only exception being if you get rooted) Far better to be able to run away.<br />
<br />
It just seems to me to be another indicator: classes that the head programmers play get the cool stuff.  Classes that they dont play get forgotten.  Rogues are a good example...<br />
So are clerics, IMHO- though we were definitely better off than rogues were for a long, long time.<br />
<br />
So, if you're single and/or live in S. California- submit your resume to those folks at Verant- its the only chance clerics have of getting fixed.  Because despite the money we pay, I have definitely gotten the picture of the programmers as being the same types that program muds for free... they code what makes their characters' lives/experiences more enjoyable first, and eventually (read never) get around to what they dont care about...</div></div><hr />

We prevent these deaths that puts us at the bottom of the list.  I think if Clerics weren't so entrenched in RPG's EQ wouldn't even have them....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goryn Grimblade</div><div class="date">11-15-1999, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You make a lot of sense.  It is pretty obvious whoever designed the cleric armor and quests NEVER played a cleric.  We don't get anywhere near as good an armor as other classes do.  It is hard to believe that Verant could neglect a class so much.  VERY FEW times have I seen clerics changed (good or bad) in patch updates.  It is definitely time for us to get a voice on the design team, since they appear to have forgotten us.<br />
