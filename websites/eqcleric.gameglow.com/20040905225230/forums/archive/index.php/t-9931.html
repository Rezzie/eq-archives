<br />
I've been helping a public raid every week for a couple of months now break and hold fear - many times at the request at the raid leader.  Generally I have a lot of other things I would prefer to be doing, but I understand that without clerics the break and camp ain't gonna happen.  I've had the cleric belt there forever, and I already have my EM boots, so no need for that - the only reason I am there is to help them.  I've been the only cleric that has shown up every time to help, most other clerics help for one time then move on.<br />
<br />
Now... today...<br />
<br />
Amazingly the golems and cazic are up, I don't know this when I ask the raid leader if he needs my help - no answer.  I ask a friend that is getting ready to go on the raid and he informs me of this and that three high level clerics (I'm 53, they are about the same level) are there as well.  To my knowledge these clerics haven't shown up to any raid to help out before.  I think, wow, I might get a shot a dawnfire.<br />
<br />
I send the raid leader another tell asking again if my help is needed.  His reply - &quot;Nope, not today&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, I've never expected anything from the raids, but I feel slightly miffed that the raidleader (on a public raid mind you) decided that the ONE time I could have gotten a chance at loot he doesn't need me.  I told him next time he needs me for fear to remember today... &gt;(<br />
<br />
Am I just being selfish?  I am so discouraged by this, I feel betrayed...  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

<br />
You attended weekly, and was one of the same clerics there everyweek...<br />
<br />
This week, the mini-bosses and Cazic was up, so Dawnfire may have dropped...<br />
<br />
You give the leader a tell, asking if he needed you, he said no.  You did this knowing other 50+ clerics were attending.<br />
<br />
I'm confused on what the person did wrong... he told you that you were not needed, not that you were not wanted...<br />
<br />
Had you gone, I'd be willing to be that he'd award the Dawnfire to you, based on your past attendance....<br />
<br />
Again, just a thought... could be way off base  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vulgarr</div><div class="date">07-02-2001, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I agree with your feelings Grape.  I've seen this happen several times on my server, where essentially groups will beg certain classes to join a raid, yet, if this raid somehow changes into one where that requested class may have a chance at a good item, then all of those classes suddenly come out of the woodworks to offer their assistance (I've been on hate raids with 8 clerics, half of them alts or characters you've never seen in months).<br />
<br />
Again, I do not know all of the specifics, but it definitly looks like this raid leader had all the help he needed and just took advantage of your services when he could.  I would think as a common courtesy he would of at least given you an invite, given that you had helped him break this spawn so many times before.  The fact that he wouldn't even reply at first makes it sound like he either called his friends, or his alts, or his guildy clerics to help out first.<br />
<br />
This may or may not have been the situation, but I've seen many up and coming, aspiring adventurers try and help out well established guilds just to partake in the glory of the raid and end up getting nothing in return.  This happens quite often and unfortunately, there are some guilds who do this knowing full well that they are using their new help.<br />
<br />
At least now you are all the wiser when this person asks for your &quot;help&quot; in the future.<br />

<br />
If the raid leader asked you to come several times, saying he &quot;needs&quot; you, because there weren't enough clerics, then he might well be equating &quot;need&quot; with &quot;not enough clerics&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then, if you sent him a tell asking if you were &quot;needed&quot;, he may have responded &quot;no&quot; thinking you may have had something else planned, and he had enough clerics to cover the raid.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you asked if he &quot;had room&quot; or &quot;could come&quot;, he might well have answered &quot;sure- come on over!&quot;.  If the answer was still no, then yeah, that's a pretty lame organizer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heffling</div><div class="date">07-06-2001, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bottom line is this: don't expect anything from a public raid.  They're just stupid most of the time and you can't trust the people who run them.  It's inviting trouble and I'm surprised these adhoc-type raids still exist on servers today.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm glad I haven't done anything outside of my guild for the past six months because I've learned that if I don't know you, you suck and are going to try and use me.<br />
<br />
P.S. No, I've never been burned like this before in the game. I won't be taken for a fool.<br />
