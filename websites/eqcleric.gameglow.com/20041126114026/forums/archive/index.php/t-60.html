<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And this pops up:&lt;blockquote&gt;First of all, I'm mad because some of the information was wrong and plus I nearly died after giving the potion to Lempeck because there was no<br />
warning upon the fact that I had to deliver the potion in a certain time frame, otherwise he will tell you it's too late and he starts beating the crap out of me....if it hadn't been for my friends who was with me, I would have had died.<br />
 <br />
Here on this page......(http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/Quests.htm)<br />
 <br />
You posted this information:<br />
 <br />
Shining Star of Light<br />
<br />
The Shining Star of Light is a 1h-blunt weapon possessing the following statistics:<br />
6 damage, 28 delay<br />
5 Weight<br />
Special effect: Casts Cleanse (purges disease, root, etc.)<br />
CLR PAL only<br />
<br />
The steps to obtain the staff are:<br />
<br />
<br />
Give Kizzie Mintopp 3 honey combs and 5 gold.  She gives you Honey Jum. (That is incorrect. It's exactly 30 gold, not 5! Someone owes me 3 plat and 5 gold because I had to buy 3 honeycombs from someone rather than hunt for it. Also no mention where Kizzie Mintopp was. You need to tell your readers she's in Rivervale, not far from the Fool's Gold building.) <br />
Take the Honey Jum to Aeston Wemore outside The Temple of Life in Qeynos.  He<br />
gives you the Potion to cure Lempeck (No problem there except for Wemor, his name is spelled wrong.) <br />
Take the Potion to Lempeck (he is between the river and the Miller's farm in<br />
West Karanas) (Now that's where I am seriously pissed off about. No warning was giving that I have to deliver the potion at a certain time frame. Plus I was with a group, so I don't know if the quest failed due to the fact that I was in a group. But Lempeck nonetheless said that I delievered the potion too late and decided to kill me before he dies. Like I said, thank god for my friends, I would have died.) <br />
Lempeck gives you a rusty scythe (lore version) (As the quest failed, I never got the rusty scythe). <br />
Bring the rusty sythe back to Aeston<br />
<br />
Note: you must have your faction up to do this quest..<br />
That's it. <br />
I had spend several hrs on this quest..I had to get a TP to Rivervale, buy 3 honeycombs (twice, after the first time fugged up on account I was 25 gold short!), gated back to Qeynos and delievered it to Aeston and got my potion. Took some friends with me to find Lempeck and nearly got my ass kicked and we beat his ass down. No knife drop or whatever was given to me and I spend the rest of my few minutes nearly making myself bald!<br />
<br />
This was and is not cool. And having serious lack of information is what I am tee'd off about.<br />
Please warn your readers about this.<br />
 <br />
Thank you.<br />

If anyone wishes to correct the write-up and send it to me I'd appreciate it.  I didn't do the SSoL a year ago, and if any changes happened I certainly wouldn't be aware of them now.<br />
<br />
I can't think of a diplomatic reply to Yizuman so I'll pass on that.<br />

If something is inaccurate, then that's what you get for not following up. Quest change. NPC's change. Norrath changes. EVERQUEST CHANGES.<br />
<br />
By simply TALKING to the NPC, he would have seen the quest changed to 30 gold. But instead, he probably simply walked up, handed over the stuff and got mad when it didn't work. At the time this guide was written, it was 5 gold. Now it is 30.<br />
<br />
And misspelling the name of the other NPC? Big deal. Potato, potatoe.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
If the guy is that upset about 3 platinum, I'll start a newbie char on CT and make 3pp for him.<br />

Time has nothing to do with why Lempeck attacks. The Game Manufacturers thought it would be funny to put in a random chance to pee off Lempeck. Prior to heading off to Lempeck ID the potion given to you by the guy at the Temp of Life. It should read Potion of Desease Warding if it dosn't you need to give him more Honey Jum to get the correct potion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I do have a comment here...<br />
<br />
A while back you put up an update page with corrected info about the Temple Quests (such as the icon dropping off Dwigus and not Bilge). But that page appears to have vanished and the link to the Temple Quests page still takes you to the outdated version. <br />
<br />
Just thought I'd mention it...<br />

A while back, my wizard friend was on late, alone and bored.  He decided to do a quest, and chose to try to get me the gauntlets of the ardent, which i did not yet have.  He was bound in perma, so he gated and picked up the ingot in the river. Ported to wc, babs was waiting in befallen.  Ported to neriak, picked up plat and found an enchanter.  He ran out to the temple, thrilled to be doing this favour for me...and handed all the stuff to the wrong npc.  We laugh about it now, but all that work would not have been wasted had he taken the couple of extra seconds to 'hail' the npc. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">By-Tor</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is people are LAZY!  I remember when there was no help on any games, not even atari games!<br />
People should use these websites as help, not to blindly walk through the game.  Unfortunately, these sites (more of the general ones) have walkthroughs on most quests, info on all the spells anyone has, and info on almost every item out there.  To me this takes alot of the newness out of the game and makes getting new gear or spells a ho hum event instead of the wonderous discovery it should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">06-01-2000, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excuse me, By-Tor, but why are you so bitter? You're mad because Rayne has taken the time to put up some useful information? Are you mad because you spent the time to figure it out?<br />
<br />
I'm not lazy. Not by a long shot. But neither do I have the massive amount of time to figure these quests out. The only reason to be upset here is that someone chewed Rayne out for having inaccurate info up and even Rayne for his lost time. Info is provided as is with no guarantees whatsoever, ESPECIALLY in a game that is constantly evolving like EQ.<br />
<br />
I can see why Rayne gets tired of this site. Wouldn't blame him a bit for shutting it down (wouldn't like it tho). <br />
<br />
Bottom line is if you don't want to be spoiled don't read spoiler sites but don't get upset if it's not 100% complete or inaccurate.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp...<br />

<br />
<br />
By-tor, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but my take on the By-tor post was &quot;stop whining, gamers these days are spoiled enough without complaining to site admins that their information may be incomplete/out of date&quot;.  I don't think he's mad at Rayne at all for having quest hints/helps posted, I think he was more exasperated with the guy who wrote in for thinking the world should be handed to him on a silver platter.</div></div><hr />

Now, if I misread that I apologize but it looks like he's saying that using a spoiler ruins the game. Maybe he's not, but I'm tired of people telling me what is or isn't fun in this game.<br />
<br />
And I do have to agree that too many people think they can take the easy way out. At least this guy isn't a newbie begging...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">By-Tor</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Juul was right.<br />
Sure many sites give away the game but its your choice to go there.  The problem is people start relying too much on these sites and stop thinking for themselves, ie the guy who didn't think at all when doing the quest and bitched that the info was wrong.  <br />
Rayne has THE BEST cleric site here and most people here are very helpful and discuss things in a polite and mature way.  Its sad when someone bitches about trivial stuff cause they where too stupid to even talk to the quest NPC.  You're great Rayne, keep it up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ortheao</div><div class="date">06-02-2000, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was to understand that Lempbeck suffered from lycanthropy (werewolf disease).  Active at night and not in the day.  I did my SSoL in one shot have the most difficult time with getting faction.  Handed him the potion at 1pm in the afternoon (game time) and no problem from him.<br />
<br />
That information was found IN spoiler sites, and the info that he sometimes attacks people was also in the sites (here namely).  If he got the SSoL info from a site such as this and read all the posts, he would have known about getting attacked.  It was posted everywhere I had seen.</div></div><hr />
