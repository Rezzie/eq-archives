This can be risky at the lower levels and requires a full group with 3 tanks, 2 healers, and one pure caster.<br />
The Pickclaws also drop a decent amout of money and on ocasion small bronze from the tougher MOBs.  As a cleric you will mainly be medding the whole time to keep your tanks healthy, but I don't mind getting exp and loot for sitting on my arse.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dawk Le' nal</div><div class="date">11-10-1999, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This place is incredible. I picked up most of 21 in one evening here and it was my first experience with a very high level group. I thought Perma was great, but for xp, I haven't seen things go up this fast since soloing North Ro scarabs for level 14.<br />
<br />
I was 20 when I got here with a 20 enchanter and we earned a bubble in the lookout room and had a great time medding just the right amount before the next one spawned. I don't think I could have done it with a tank as the enchanter pet did a lot of tanking while I got full use out of smite after the magic resistance of the picklaw was lowered. We did the bubble in about an hour and somehow had the nerve to leave a great situation for sleep. PS-Enchanters are amazing in small controlm groups.<br />
<br />
The next day my 22 druid friend joined me in a high level group. There were 2 27's a 25, a 24 and us in the group. For a while we had 3 spawns in the guard room and both in the lookout room, but we eventualy gave up the lookout room for all 4 guard room spawns. The druid made 23 quickly and I made 3 bubbles in roughly 3 hours. It was awesome fun and I did not need to sit a med during battle because we really had nothing to fear with this group. We did not have a tank either but 3 shaman, 2 druids and 1 cleric.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to hit the war room in this place and I will go back regularly.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />
