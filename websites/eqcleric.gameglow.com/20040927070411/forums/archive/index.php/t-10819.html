<br />
Well, my guild (The Ascension) is doing a weeknight raid on Hate, the first we'll have been on since the changes.<br />
<br />
We have done scheduled raids before, but always taken along a few &quot;vets&quot; from other guilds, including a rogue puller.  This time we are intending to give it a shot more &quot;just us&quot; than guests, including our own puller (Sssilk, an Ikky Monk).<br />
<br />
We have less people turning up that we initially expected, and, after the &quot;tuning&quot; that's gone on up there, there are many doubts being formed in the minds of some of our folks.<br />
<br />
This will be my first planes raid (provided I pull my finger out and get out of 45 by then!) so, any and all advice, from both a Clerical viewpoint, and also for the guild as a whole (break in stragtegies etc), would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks muchly<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">03-25-2001, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just finished a raid there last night.  Our findings were that sometimes the regular Clerics of Inny were dropping 2 pieces instead of one.  This is good because there were many that were empty.  (I got sleeves and a bracer).<br />
<br />
So, first floor seemed pretty much the same.  We accidently aggro'd Maestro once and he wiped us out pretty handily where we might've been able to take him before.<br />
<br />
Second floor was weird.  Pathing is just awful.  Some roamer would aggro on you, knock you about a bit, when run off for awhile.  They seem pretty much MR up there, so you've got to split up your raid on multiple mobs, however when they're running around like that, it's difficult to do it. And by the time the confusion was sorted out, the clerics and spell casters would be dead... <br />
<br />
However, if you got past a bad spot like that and found an area with relatively little aggro, you could sort of pull some of the things there a short distance.  Other times you need to go from house to house.<br />
We didn't do any mini-bosses.<br />
<br />
We didn't see much of anything drop off the Sages, Diciples, Elite Dragons and Travel Agents.  But a huge amount of pally gear dropped.  No PoG gear for clerics... whaah!  Not fair, I can't hunt there.<br />
<br />
Oh! The spam is JUST awful!  Every few minutes every Innorruk follower gets into a religious ferment and shout hallelujah or something to that effect.  If you get too close to a static it'll spam you with some sort of message... over and over and over.  You can't turn it off.<br />
<br />
But the one thing that is fun is that the mobs have &quot;last words&quot; that they utter when you kill them, or they have some smart-ass comment if they kill you.<br />
<br />
And the zone has emotes too which were kind of fun and were not overdone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KamuelaTZ</div><div class="date">03-26-2001, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night I went up. Two groups ported in at once and some bugged train showed up. Gargs, clerics, and even chests came to wipe us out.<br />
<br />
We gathered up and tried again. This time just before a rat died more mobs showed up and promptly wiped out the healers and then the rest of the groups.<br />
<br />
I've heard there is no safe spot anymore but after seeing that bugged train I'll take my chances anywhere else other then a portal break-in.<br />

When we went up last week, we fought in the portal room with no problems, then moved north along the wall a little, then to the fountains and then into maestro's throne.<br />
<br />
I think we had 3 groups in the portal room, I know there was only 2 enchanters and 3 clerics that I can recall. We were certainly fighting for quite some time, but we were never in any danger of getting wiped out. Average level would be quite high though, 56-57 maybe.<br />

<br />
On 2nd floor we did find a large hall which had 2 rooms off of it.  On room had a table with  many different mobs surround it and a gnome on top of the table. <br />
We were able to pull 1 mob and almost had him dead when the entire room rushed us and wiped us out.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, that gnome said &quot;That felt gooooooooood&quot; after he HT'd me and killed me.<br />
<br />
They did die after CR, but I logged so I don't know if they dropped anything..<br />
<br />
2nd floor gave us some ranger pants and a Culler...also a nice pally sword.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KamuelaTZ</div><div class="date">03-30-2001, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So people are doing a portal break now?<br />
<br />
I'm biased, never got killed before running to the SW camp spot. Then get wiped out twice at the portal.<br />
<br />
One thing that went wrong was timing. Trying to get three or more well balanced groups to arrive at the same time is difficult. That's probably what I like most about SW camp, more unity after you get everyone rez'd.<br />

<br />
The singing of Innoruuk's praises would jump my PL up to 100% every time.  The constant aggro messages upstairs were terrible.  I really hope they do something about that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arturo</div><div class="date">04-02-2001, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, spent Saturday clearing most of Hate.  Burned through 1st floor in 3 hours. Went up to 2nd floor and got to experience the true meaning of spam.  I was able to sit outside a house of 8 mobs just running in circles while I nuked one till I was oom and it still didn't chase after me. /Hail load up the AEs.  The drops were terrible.  Not a single piece of armor dropped, but we did get 2 culvers.  Neat little Bushido Blades for rangers and warriors. When you go on the floor that Inny is on, you get spammed to death by the mobs underneath you to the point that you cant even read general tells or guildchat.  Let me reiterate 2nd floor is THE SUCK!  Also, no reason to kill Inny unless you're a gnome.<br />

<br />
The SW corner now has a trap similar to the Dragon Necropolis, with a lot of 'evil imps' that attack.<br />
<br />
The mobs on the 1st floor are almost the same.  There are now mini-bosses for each level, which are level 56.  They did not appear to be as tough as normal level 56 mobs.  Each mini-boss drops 2 items plus an inny item.<br />
<br />
The Maestro has been beefed up to level 56.<br />
