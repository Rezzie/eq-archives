</FONT><HR>This morning I sent this email to Verant in the hopes that it would get to Rich.  I'll repost it here and ask for observations from the community.<P><BR>Dear Mr. Waters,<P>	I'd like to submit my observations regarding your upcoming priest rebalancing.  I am a dedicated Everquest player with over 175 days played across two characters on seperate accounts.  I play in a NTOV/AOW-capable guild as a level 60 cleric on the Rathe Server.  My roommate plays a level 60 shaman and my live-in girlfriend plays a level 54 druid.  Given my experience and observations with all three priest classes, I feel that I can provide intelligent, if not completely unbiased feedback.<P>	I was heartened to see your comments on the castersrealm webpage regarding priest rebalancing, though I admit that I have some trepidation from the perspective of a cleric.  It is the impression of many clerics that we are often considered to be the benchmark priest class that the other classes are 'balanced up' to.  Druids in particular often complain about their lack of function in raid environments, and will cite the fact that raids are 'dependant' upon clerics as an argument for their own rebalancing.<P>	You have the information and observations of thousands of players, so I won't bore you with a tedious list or series of class comparisons.  Instead I wish to submit one simple analogy that I hope you will consider.  <P>	Druids argue that they are not useful on raids and are therefore restricted from an important aspect of the game.  That same argument can be turned around and used from the cleric perspective.  Nobody ever cancelled a raid for lack of druids, but when was the last time you saw a cleric quad-kiting in the Cobalt Scar?  Druids are not the only class that has been restricted from an important aspect of the game.  I hope that in your rebalancing of the priest classes, you can make just as serious an inroad toward allowing Clerics 'out of the box' as you will with allowing druids more versatility in healing.  Let us solo.  Let us be efficient in small groups again.<P><BR>	That's really all I want to say, and I thank you for taking the time to read this.  The only thing I could add is that I've lived with all three classes on raids, and frankly I -know- that druids and shamans are effective for most healing in raid groups.  It is my impression that the very versatility of these classes is what hurts them in the healing category.  As a cleric, I heal because I have no options otherwise.  All of my attention and resources are devoted to healing.  As a druid or shaman, I have other options, and it's only when a druid or shaman doesn't devote themselves 100% to healing that they are ineffective on a raid.  Much of the healing on a raid does -not- involve casting Complete Heal on a tank, and giving druids more healing versaitility will not improve their position on a raid unless the players take on the 'healer' mindset.  It is my observation that most druids consider raid-healing to be a degrading role.<P>	Thank you for your time and consideration.  I would welcome any questions or dialogue from you.  I may be reached via email at <Deleted>.<P>Sincerely,<P>Steve Dikerson<P>Borick Ascid<BR>High Priest of Brell<BR>Noble Blade<BR>The Rathe<P>Ervil Kenervil<BR>Level 45 Gnome Necromancer<BR>Noble Blade<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think your letter is quite good and needs to be said.<P>In the last two expansions, clerics have lost a lot of ground. Others, however, still point to the age old arguments that we're wonderful. Clerics have complete heal and obviously dont deserve anything but that in their opinions.<P>We are indeed necessary for raids, but so are warriors, so are shaman, so are rogues, etc. <P>I'd like my place back in experience groups. Fungus grove and Velks have made me not only unnecessary, but a worse choice. Druids and shaman have alot more to offer then just healing.<P>I'm honestly tired of being skipped on balancing because of complete heal. It has been in the game since Classic. The game is BUILD AROUND it. It isnt unbalancing. The game was designed that way.<P>I'd like to see more utility spells as we currently only have root. I hate being one of the top 10 clerics on my server yet still being easy to kill on my way to various zones. Every other priest and every other caster has invis. I really dont like having to wait till VT to get invis and then take an exceptional mask from melee. ITs rediculous.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just an observation, but I agree that most druids and to some degree shamans, feel that healing during a raid is degrading and beneath them. They are there to nuke and slow and buff, not to heal.<P>I have been in places where I am in mid CH on a warrior, and a caster draws aggro from a resist or something, and before I can complete my cast, the caster dies. This is not my fault, since I can't let the warrior die just to save the caster. However, when I scroll up, I see not a single heal from either the shaman or druid in my group. I ask them why didn't they heal, and I have actually been told, by a PRIEST class, "I didn't have a heal memmed".<P>What can you do? As I said, GIVE them druids and shamans Complete Heal. And watch them die from the aggro caused by it, cause they don't have the AC to take it, or the invunerabilities to save them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Shaman tend to have similar ac and hp to a cleric. After all the are the kings of buffing. If you think a shaman wouldn't add agi and sta buffs plus fos etc to himself...your crazy.<P>Alot of shaman in my guild on raids have more ac/hp then I do. Not that it matters...because frankly uber mobs tear through either of us too fast to really get heals on.

</FONT><HR><B>I was heartened to see your comments on the castersrealm webpage regarding priest rebalancing, though I admit that I have some trepidation from the perspective of a cleric.  It is the impression of many clerics that we are often considered to be the benchmark priest class that the other classes are 'balanced up' to.  Druids in particular often complain about their lack of function in raid environments, and will cite the fact that raids are 'dependant' upon clerics as an argument for their own rebalancing.</B><BR> <BR>  It sounds more like you're whining about druids than trying to reveal a problem with clerics.<BR>  <BR><B>Druids argue that they are not useful on raids and are therefore restricted from an important aspect of the game.  That same argument can be turned around and used from the cleric perspective.  Nobody ever cancelled a raid for lack of druids, but when was the last time you saw a cleric quad-kiting in the Cobalt Scar?  Druids are not the only class that has been restricted from an important aspect of the game.  I hope that in your rebalancing of the priest classes, you can make just as serious an inroad toward allowing Clerics 'out of the box' as you will with allowing druids more versatility in healing.  Let us solo.  Let us be efficient in small groups again.</B><BR> <BR>  Clerics can't quad, druids have no place in AE groups.  Clerics can and probably should be made more fun to play and to be able to solo better, but it really has nothing to do with druids.<BR> <BR><B>That's really all I want to say, and I thank you for taking the time to read this.  The only thing I could add is that I've lived with all three classes on raids, and frankly I -know- that druids and shamans are effective for most healing in raid groups.  It is my impression that the very versatility of these classes is what hurts them in the healing category.  As a cleric, I heal because I have no options otherwise.  All of my attention and resources are devoted to healing.  As a druid or shaman, I have other options, and it's only when a druid or shaman doesn't devote themselves 100% to healing that they are ineffective on a raid.</B><BR>   <BR>  Okay, so you are whining about druids.  Honestly spending your time trying to get devs to ignore others complaints is pretty low.<BR> <BR>  I've played a 60 druid, 60 cleric and a 60 shaman on raids.  No, druids can't heal unless you're raiding Crushbone.  Next raid unmem everything but Judgement and your level 34 superior heal (which is more efficient than the level 60 Nature's Touch) and you are a druid.  Enjoy.  Shaman's can't heal FAST, and they can't heal well outside their group, but most times when damage isn't coming in too fast they'll keep their party alive if not themselves.<BR> <BR>  You also mention versatility being what makes the other classes less focused on healing.  The fact is though that clerics are just as versatile as the other classes.  For everything druids or shamans can do, there is something clerics can do, although fear may not be as useful as slow, or stun as useful as malo clerics are every bit as versatile.<BR> <BR><B>Much of the healing on a raid does -not- involve casting Complete Heal on a tank, and giving druids more healing versaitility will not improve their position on a raid unless the players take on the 'healer' mindset.</B>  <BR> <BR>  Most druids have a healer mindset and few do anything but heal despite how bad they are at it by 60.  Why do you think druids are ASKING for healing versatility?  Because they think they're wizards?<BR> <BR>  Druids won't and shouldn't get healing versatility, that is the cleric role.  But the fact is that heals haven't really been upgraded since Kunark where your tough mobs on the way to kill that ever so threatening Trakanon are NOWHERE NEAR as threatening as your typical mob in The Deep or Ssra and CT where they hit for 400.  Druids, shamans AND clerics need upgraded healing.<BR> <BR>  A 60 druid has nukes as efficient as a 60 wizard.  Their best heal is LESS efficient than a level 34 cleric heal.  DESPITE THIS many (not all) druids still have the delusion they are healers and are crying for more healing.  Maybe it has to do with getting outnuked by clerics at 56.<BR>  <BR><B>It is my observation that most druids consider raid-healing to be a degrading role.</B><BR> <BR>  Um... yeah.<P>[This message has been edited by Lind (edited 05-27-2002).]<p>[This message has been edited by Lind (edited 05-27-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Lind,<P>Nowhere was the tone of my email whining, and to use such a response degrades the discussion.<P>The posts Rich made regarding priest rebalancing was in a druid forum, in response to a request from druids, therefore my comparison in my own letter was made in that vein.<P>I know -exactly- how well druids, shamans and clerics heal.  I know what each class can do and what each class cannot do.  I said nothing against rebalancing any class.  I merely pointed out that while the argument that the druids made (And to which he was responding) could serve equally as well from the cleric's standpoint.<P>I'd love to have SOW, snare, tracking, teleports, DOT's, efficient nukes and heals that are nearly as efficient as any heal a cleric has (Except for Complete Heal).  You compare quad-kiting and druid soloability to a cleric being in an AE group?  That's ridiculous.  For every AE group, you need -one- cleric.  There are a limited number of areas where AE-grouping is applicable (Compared to the number of places where solo-kiting is a viable tactic) and, oh yeah...  an AE group requires a GROUP, of a very specific makeup and with all the difficulties that go along with finding and maintaining such a group.<P>Once again, for those like Lind who might not have gotten it, the priest rebalancing statements made by Rich came from a druid forum in response to druids who were asking for rebalancing.  That's why you see druids used as the comparison class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR><B>Lind- you may have played a 60 druid on a raid, but have you played a druid to 60?</B><BR> <BR>  Yes.<BR> <BR>  Honestly pre 60 isn't very important unless you're on the new no split server.  Talking pre 60 is talking no Aego, no Torpor, no Malo, no Ice Spear, i.e. no point.  Okay, sure 50 to 59 is pretty screwed up balance wise and needs to be fixed too.<BR> <BR><B>You mention that clerics are as versatile as a druid.<P>Umm, NO!!</B><BR> <BR>  I think you're confusing versatility and effectiveness.  Line up the different things each priest/caster class can do and they all come out pretty much the same, but no one is going to ask a wizard for a damage shield because while they have it and are thus versatile, it isn't really all that effective.<BR> <BR><B>My cleric is NOWHERE near able to solo like my druid can.</B><BR> <BR>  My cleric can solo just fine, but will not get as good an XP/hour as my druid, who will not get as good an XP/hour as the better equipped meleers or pet classes in my guild, who will get simply blown away by people two boxing.<BR> <BR><B>She flew through the levels- with her ability to quad,  "ROT" (root/dot), easy travel to the solo zone, port to a zone to get a clarity then back to your solo zone, tracking to find those blue mobs. Shaiel doesnt need a rez spell, because she doesnt die.  The list of advantages a druid has for soloing is a long one.  There is no comparison.</B><BR> <BR>  Soloing xp isn't as good as leeching xp off meleers anyway.  My cleric though meleed most of her way to 50 mostly solo in a few days played while getting faction.  Twinking aside, pre 60 isn't what I'm talking about.<BR> <BR><B>In experience groups, druids are fabulous healers.</B><BR> <BR>  In my experience we'd have to not pull things because I'd be OOM with my druid healing until we got a shaman to slow and suddenly I'd never heal again and be nuking and we'd never be not fighting.  Level 60 Nature's Touch is 2.2 hp/mana, Cleric level 34 Superior Heal is 2.45 hp/mana.  Do the math, if a druid makes a fantastic healer than a cleric makes a fantastic nuker/meleer because the healing part of the job ain't taking them anything in the way of mana by 60.<BR> <BR><B>And please dont give me the argument about how we are talking Raid healing here- because unless you make that new healing spell to be only active in TOV, then its gonna come out in Seb, Velks, Chardok, HS, etc.  "Druids needing healing upgrade for raids" is an old saw- read the old posts for the pros and cons.  They do FINE in xp groups.</B><BR> <BR>  Sebilis isn't Ssra or CT.  150 hitting froggies are not 400 hitting snakes and lizards.  It's not my fault they've screwed over their game good and hard (and on top of that they're SLOWABLE so a shaman makes that a 100 hitting snake or lizard!)<BR> <BR>  When leveling in Sebilis there was no way in hell I could keep up with healing with my druid.  Sure I can NOW because everyone in the place is 60 and a 60 meleer just takes practically no damage compared to a 53, but when everyone is 53 there was just NO WAY without a slower.  But Sebilis, HS and stuff is where meleers go to solo now, it's Ssra and CT I care about.<BR> <BR><B>I am not upset with that- because I applaud versatility in group- makeup.  But improving druid healing will finish off clerics in xp groups.</B><BR> <BR>  I don't care.  Clerics finished themselves off by there being so damn many because the game has forced it that way.  But clerics have the option of being in an AE group, druids don't.  With PoP making porting FINALLY more of a minor convience than a frustrating barrier to playing the game, hooking up groups will be easier and soloing will be less of a clear winner for getting xp.<BR> <BR>  To be honest, slow needs HEAVY HEAVY HEAVY nerfing and all the priests need upgraded heals.  But if druids get nothing in the way of more heals, instead getting freed from having to ever cast another insanely mana innefficient heal so they can deal some damage with nukes that would be fine too.  Necromancers are the masters of life and death, they already outheal druids, druids can nuke a lot like wizards, druids should probably get wizard upgrades and just forget the fact they could ever cast a heal in the first place and necros get complete heal.  =P<BR> <BR><B>I think everyone wants some "magic bullet" fix that will make them snapped up for xp groups and raids.  With 3 types of priest classes, and all the advances in gear- the playing field has been levelled.  We are all going to have to live with sitting LFG for a while and perhaps being a bit pro-active to get a group.</B><BR> <BR>  Clerics nuke much better than druids heal, but druids are still pumping all their mana through very poor heal spells.  Most are frustrated as hell because for most of the first 59 levels they thought they were healers (and for the first 40 they actually were,) but they get 60 and they find out they're oh so wrong, bit by bit.  Just look at the manaregen of a shaman compared to a druid and ignoring torpor except on themselves a shaman can sustain three times the healing a druid can through chloroblast even before slapping 75% slow on mobs turning those 400 hitters into 100 hitters.  To give you some idea how poor a druid is for healing 3 times as much sustained healing is the difference between the cleric nuke and the druid quad nuke for sustained damage...  And thats just compared to shaman's chloroblast.<p>[This message has been edited by Lind (edited 05-28-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

As a level 60 cleric with quite a bit of end-game gear, the best I can manage is to pick out a single static blue spawn (6-7K hit points) and hit it repeatedly with a series of DD/Stuns followed by a fast root before the stun wears off.  I get a free DD/Stun with my sprinkler of suffering, but as far as I know there are only two of these on the Rathe server. Every now and then I can toss in a Judgement.  The mob drops in roughly 6-8 minutes.  At this rate I can net one yellow bubble of AA-XP in roughly 3.5 hours of steady work.  This is -not- 'soloing just fine', and I'll note again that most clerics would run themselves out of mana with each pull and require meditate time that I don't need.<P><B> <BR>  Soloing xp isn't as good as leeching xp off meleers anyway.

If you're saying that you leveled your cleric to 60 with a high-level warrior partner, then you're not addressing the balance of the class, and if you're saying you meleed your way to 50 as a cleric, you're lying or exploiting. <P><B><BR>  In my experience we'd have to not pull things because I'd be OOM with my druid healing until we got a shaman to slow and suddenly I'd never heal again and be nuking and we'd never be not fighting. </B><P>A level 60 monk in Fungus Grove, a friend of mine, carves through the 'shrooms in about 90 seconds and takes roughly one to two bubbles of damage in the process.  As a cleric, I can land one heal on him every 90 seconds and keep him topped off.  So can a druid.  The druid, however, can also snare the mob, can regen the monk (Thus reducing the healing requirements further) and can nuke the mob far more effectively than I could.  The AA-XP game is all about low-risk, fast-pull XP, and people don't really need a cleric sitting there doing nothing, leaching away XP. <BR> <BR><B>I don't care.  Clerics finished themselves off by there being so damn many because the game has forced it that way.</B><P>Look around you.  Clerics are outnumbered by druids on every server by a wide margin.  Also, you've abandoned logical premise here.<P><B>But clerics have the option of being in an AE group, druids don't. </B><P>Last time I checked, there were perhaps 3-4 spots in the entire game where an AE group was effective.  AE groups are rare and require a specific balance of classes to obtain and maintain.  This has nothing to do with balance within the class.  Very few clerics have access to AE groups.<BR> <BR>I won't address the issue of shamans and slow.  Yes, shamans can sustain incredible amounts of damage due to their ability to slow.  This allows them to do some pretty amazing things solo, but they still can't solo safely and effectively as the druid can. You don't slow/tank/DOT Yeldema for XP as a shaman.  You do it for bragging rights.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I absolutly love the Druid's arguement that "clerics solo just fine". Ever see a cleric quad kite? Ever see a cleric solo just 1 MOB? Hell, how many times have you seen a cleric get his ass handed to him by a GREEN mob?<P>My guild recently did a trip to Umbral Plains, killing Goturu's (sp?) and such. We had 2 groups. 60 warrior to tank, 60 shaman to slow, 60 cleric (me) to buff/heal, 60 enchanter in 1 group. The other group was all guildmates between 50 and 59 that got all the exp. My wife was playing her Gnome SK in the "exp group". She was getting what we considered to be AWSOME exp. We asked the group if they were getting good exp. EVERYONE in the group agreed that the exp was awsome, EXCEPT the druid, who said <P>QUOTE: it's ok, but I get better soloing.<P>On one hand, druids try to placate us by telling us that "we can solo just fine", where we have to burn a whole bar of mana (or take 15 minutes fighting) to kill 1 blue MOB, and then on the other hand, they go out quad kiting and get so much exp doing it that even REALLY good group exp is only "ok".

Clerics are outnumbered by druids on every server by a wide margin.  Also, you've abandoned logical premise here.</B><BR> <BR>  Not on my server, not post 50, and not even pre 50 anymore.<BR> <BR><B>Last time I checked, there were perhaps 3-4 spots in the entire game where an AE group was effective.  AE groups are rare and require a specific balance of classes to obtain and maintain.  This has nothing to do with balance within the class.  Very few clerics have access to AE groups.</B><BR>  <A HREF="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=16857.topic" TARGET=_blank>http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=16857.topic</A> <BR> <BR><B>I won't address the issue of shamans and slow.  Yes, shamans can sustain incredible amounts of damage due to their ability to slow.  This allows them to do some pretty amazing things solo, but they still can't solo safely and effectively as the druid can.</B> <BR> <BR>  You severly overestimate druids.<BR> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR><B>  I Think this is the point.  Druids have become gods of anything in the simple zones where people would rake in exp and require minimal healing.</B><BR> <BR>  NO!  Any group that a druid can be primary healer in is BETTER OFF without the druid (or cleric.)  Druid's sustained damage output even with moonfire is paltry compared to a meleer and their healing so bad that they just can't help a group kill enough to pay for the XP they're sucking.  Even wizards throwing nothing but Ice Spears are nothing more than XP leechs in xp groups.<BR> <BR><B>Now Verant has turned around and designed a great zone bringing back the necessity of a cleric for grouping, and you berate it because you can't cut the healing mustard as you feel entitled to.</B><BR> <BR>  The group needs a cleric, fine.  No problem.  Don't need a ranger, don't need an SK, don't need a monk, don't need a wizard, don't need a druid, don't need a mage, but NEEDING a cleric is okay?  No, it isn't.<BR> <BR>  That aside, you find a cleric, every 6th person on the server is a cleric anyway because you need them, and you go there and... guess what?  As a druid you can't backup heal because the mobs hit for 400 and your feeble heal spells suck, so you don't even try.  You use moonfire which is just as efficient as Garrison's or Elnerik's and guess what, you and the wizard at the end of the night did... the exact same damage, and half the damage of a meleer.  i.e. punt the druid, punt the wizard, grab 2 more meleer and you'd have killed 25% more, gotten 25% more xp.<BR> <BR><B>You pay a price for being capable of doing a little of everything.  As a specialist I ought to be more powerful in certain circumstances.</B><BR> <BR>  Clerics are no more specialists than anyone else.  Druids no more a generalist than anyone else.  Give druids fear, atone, lull, rez, da, the word AEs, and buff heals and I'll agree with you.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Cali, at no point was I 'whining' about any class.  An issue is an issue.  The use of a denigrating term to invalidate someone's argument is little more than ad hominem.<P>Lind, I've already looked over the 'AE availablily' post, and it does nothing to prove your point.  AE groups are not comparable to druid soloing.<P>Cali, any list of class abilities is going to be subjective until you get right down  to damage, how fast the damage is dealt, how well it is avoided and how efficiently it is mitigated, so any comparison such as yours (Or mine) will be entirely subjective.  You can't make a list of spells, line them up against each other and say 'this is comparable to this'.  Stun isn't comparable to snare, in my mind. I'd sacrifice every stun spell in my arsenal to have snare.  You can't compare our nukes to druid nukes, just as druids can't compare their overal healing capability to a cleric.<P>To address Lind's quotes directly:<P><B>Snare is mostly a convience, even for kiting. Most places you can simply path a mob over terrain and have ample time to cast. This is how druids kill unsnarable mobs with their 6 second cast nukes without getting hit.</B><P>You're describing a pathing exploit, and an exception to the rule. Without snare most mobs will close the gap between the themselves and the druid before the druid can finish the cast-time.  While it may be possible to use a fast casting nuke between the time the mob gets into casting range and when it hits, you're really stretching the truth to say that snare is merely a convenience.<P><B>Speed increases" I have no idea what you're talking about.</B><P>Spirit of the Wolf.  Spirit of the Eagle.  You know, those spells that, when combined with snare, allow the druid to outpace the mob and give them the seconds they need to cast a nuke on a mob before it can get into melee range.  Clerics don't get that.<P><B> Regen is comperable to MoK, I haven't tested it but regen is probably worse. That leaves 6 for each class. Not that I'd really agree with the remaining list either.</B><P>Regrowth of the Grove is a constant 15 (Or 18.  I get some argument in the matter) points of regen per tick.  MoK is 15 points per main-hand attack per round of melee combat and has to be reapplied on every single mob, with the subsequent mana cost (or you can rely on a 10-second cast-time BP).  It isn't even REMOTELY comparable.<P>The unfortunate fact is that you're wrong on every count, Lind, but you have succeeded in doing the one thing I didn't want - you've turned the thread into another typical bitchfest between the druid and cleric classes.<P>The original intent of my letter was to draw attention to our class during the rebalancing -- basically to say 'While you're greasing the squeaky wheel over there, don't forget that the same argument applies to our situation'.  I don't have a problem with any class being made more capable and balanced within the game, but I don't want our own issues to be overlooked in the process.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Ok let me explain a bit.  <P>Used Non-CH heal, because the discussion seemed to be more focused on places where CH wouldn't necessarliy be the best choice.  And since CH is the class defining spell, it's like comparing CH to druid ports.  <P>The statement was that cleric's nuke better than druid's heal.  So the top direct heal that Clerics get is Divine light.  The top nuke they get is judgement, both in the 50's.  For Druids, the top nuke is Moonfire, and the heal is Nature's touch.  <P>It seems to me that the only problem with my little experiment is that I didn't use complete heal.  Well, CH is not the issue here, people.  The issue is versatility for the secondary characteristics.  So, cleric's nuke efficency is between 48 and 75% that of druids.  Yet a druid's healing efficiency is between 80 and 98% that of clerics.  <P>I have nothing against druids, I love them to death.  I do have an issue with the idea that clerics are overpowered healing wise.  Erm, we are CLERICS.  <P>What the hell else can we do?  Can we invis?  No.  Can we lev?  No.  Can we EB?  No.  Can we travel safely while alone?  No.  Can we solo anything *but* undead with any type of efficiency?  No.  Can we get into raids?  Yep.  Can we help eliminate corpse runs?  Yep.  Can we keep people alive to avoid corpse runs?  Usually, depending on the intelligence of other people.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I personally don't think the cleric class is overpowered.  Clerics are necessary for raids.  But so are Tanks.  *grin*.  I may not have heard of a raid being called for lack of druids, but I *have* seen them called for lack of a sufficient MA.  Hmmm, does that mean Warriors are overpowered?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>A cleric's soloability is related to two things, and two things only:<P>1.  The quality of the guild he is in.<BR>2.  The equipment he wears.<P>I proved this on The Seventh Hammer when I played Rathen and was soloing LDCs in Sol B, as a cleric, using Mark of Karn, Mark of Retribution, and a Poison Wind Censer.  A cleric solos effectively by having superior equipment and weaponry.  Period.  If you are attempting to solo in a druid fashion, by using root + DD, or root & DOT undead mobs, you are doing yourself a disservice.<P>Even at level 60, fully buffed, Rathen bordered around 1175 ac, more than enough to handle a wimpy LDC.  Had I had 34 to 41% haste to go with my PWC, to increase my chances of procing the AE poison spell, I could have soloed even faster.  I merely Celestial Elixir'ed myself to recover lost hit points from the Boiling Blood and the melee damage.  Poison resistance was buffed with my gear and Resist Poison to negate the effects of the AE poison rain.<P>Clerics... think... outside... the... box.  Its how you solo; its the only way to solo.<P>Now reconsider this... if I could add a Ring of Dain Frostweaver to my collection of items, I would have a 10 pt dmg shield stacking with my 15 pt dmg shield, for 25 pts.  I also get 10 pts regen per tick from this as well.  Let's add a fungi tunic to the equation.  Again, regeneration per tick is increased.  Let's add another damage shield by acquiring a Regal Band of Bathezid, not a difficult item to acquire at all, only time consuming.  Now you have a possibly 50 pt damage shield and 25 hp per tick regen.  This is how a cleric solos... I repeat unto you.  We solo through our equipment and our abilities.  The highest level clerics in the EQ game now have access to a right-click root ring from Vex Thal, 2.0 second casting time.  All we need now is a right-click item with Retribution or Reckoning, and you'll see clerics soloing as time passes.  "Why should I group with you and your group of melees when I can solo using my equipment and get better experience?"  Expect to see that after Planes of Power is out.  I bet you any amount of money you want to bet; it will happen.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Now, as a cleric, the most realistic way of handling this, is to group with the said druid or a wizard, to get proper escort to ToV, including invis and levitation.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Negative.  Again, you aren't thinking outside of the box.  Acquire a ranger friend and go to South Karana and camp Quillmane.  Kill him until he drops a Pegasus Feather Cloak.  Rathen has one, so will Mananut, and so should you.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>The extreme lack of utility spells for clerics is my major peeve with the class.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Utility can be somewhat supplimented via AAXP abilities.  Run Speed 3.  Acquire it.  Love it.  Cherish it.  Don't want to waste the AAXP points?  Buy a horse, they're only 110,000 pp (and that's the only one worth wasting your money on).  Its self only, but really that's what you're saying.  You want regen and you want SOW.  Those come through items or abilities.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I can't understand why *warriors* should have several available invis items to choose from, when clerics get none.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>Gnomish Vanishing Device.  Camp the items, find a Tinkerer, have him make it.  Or buy it for 15,000 to 20,000 pp.  Its worth the investment.  Buy 4 stacks of Class 5 Mana Batteries and keep a Toolbox on you at all times to recharge it.  This item is invaluable and will save your life.  Unlike poor quality spell invisiblity, GVD invis lasts for 20 minutes, solid fixed duration.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>If druids become better healers, then clerics should be given improved versatility to remove the "portable bandaid" part of the class, when almost everything in the game including basic travel requires the help of others.<BR><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This is a good point, but you fail to address how you'd like to deal with it.  The pottery idols were a step in the right direction, but I think Verant should now add more idols to port everyone.  Allow the to port to various druid or wizard teleportation places.  Make the items have recommended levels of 55 to 60.  Ideally I'd vote 60.  That way no druid can reasonably complain. Make the components expensive, but not rare.  Rarity just pisses people off.  If people realize they're going to be paying 2000 pp per component for a combine and the combine requires two to five of these components, and there is a chance of failure, that alone will deter all but the wealthiest players from pursuing such items.<P>This is how you function as a cleric at level 60 if you want to solo... you have to acquire, in whatever way and through whatever capacity is available to you, items that will allow you to solo effectively.  Hammer of the Sun, if its casting range is increased to a good bit, could be the solo tool we clerics have been aching for.  That combined with the right-click Immobilize with the 2.0 second cast time and you have an unstoppable undead soloing machine.<P>The Age of Cleric Soloing is coming people... its just a difficult pinnacle to obtain and will be an uphill battle the entire way.<p>[This message has been edited by Mananut Bhread (edited 05-28-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

In fact I doubt that many clerics at all are capable of collecting these sorts of toys. How can you define class balance by the extreme exception?<P>And even WITH these toys, soloing isn't effective.  I play a necro as my alt.  I just got through playing for six hours as a druid.  I was AMAZED at how simple everything was with the druid, at how effortlessly I healed my group and kept a higher manapool while doing so than I've ever thought of doing with my cleric.<P>Even with all of my toys, soloing LDC or frogs in LGuk is a pain, and most of those are light blue.

The best solo XP I've found yet is in Echo Caverns, casting about 34 sprinkler nukes on a smuggler guard.  8 minutes to kill for about one-sixth of a blue bubble of AA XP, and that's given my arguably exceptional level of equipment.<P><BR>Borick Ascid<BR>High Priest of Brell<BR>Noble Blade<BR>The Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Because you won't figure this out unless I tell you, run screaming like a little girl with the bogey man after her while your upheaval refreshes.

You think finding a group is bad, it takes all of 8 (I'm being generous, you can probably quad in Skyshrine or something I haven't tried) lvl60 quadders to take all the quad/ae solo spots IN THE GAME.  That means it's time to switch to your cleric alt because it's easier to get a group/duo with a cleric even when there are 5 clerics in every zone and only 1 or 2 druids and wizards.<p>[This message has been edited by Lind (edited 05-30-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008628-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008628-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008628&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008628&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
