I know what he hits for and about his AE's, just looking for info on how/where to fight him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">09-27-2001, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We just fight him at c4 (north wall near the fire) with backs to wall. Nothing really complex in fighting him except I wouldn't advice trying to primary tank. Can bind there if you feel like being extra cheesy, but..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanilya Silverwind</div><div class="date">09-28-2001, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We use a primary tank that has CT on him about 95% of the fight.  Keep him alive, and nobody dies.  If you can't figure out how to keep him alive then you probably shouldn't be bothering with CT unless you plan on zerging him or something stupid.</div></div><hr />

Anyway we have a whole bunch of warriors with rather ungodly stats so they're all allowed to get hit when they feel like it. In general they take 2 bubs of damage, get a CH and go back to the fray. There's always someone there to tank him even after knockbacks so we avoid kiting etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have 4 or so L60 warriors, 3 of which are in Warlord armor. No ST weapons or anything like that but they do know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
Our problem is the knockback, and aggro control. We are having a whale of a time trying to lock down CT from wiping other melee, esp when the main tank is feared or knocked back.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? We've slain Velkator a couple of times and only deaths are the warriors when /disc defensive runs out. Can CT be tanked without defensive?<br />
<br />
Thanks, this board is a wealth of info.</div></div><hr />

Utendar, if you gonna charge it with &quot;multi-MTs, 4 lvl60 warriors with good resist it should be fine. Say warrior 1 &amp; 2 got feared or knocked-back, warrior 3 &amp; 4 take the turn and inform their healers till warrior1 and warr2 is back. Its all about aggro management among the Main Tanks <br />
<br />
<br />
*add*<br />
its snare is almost? unresistable<br />
its fear is resistable<br />
its knockblack is semi resistable<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Utendar</div><div class="date">10-23-2001, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahh thanks guys for those diagrams, they are very helpful.<br />
<br />
To add a few things, our warriors are no where near what others are describing here in regards to gear. I think the best we can manage is somewhere near 5500HP with the others all around 5200-5300 range with raid buffs. So we use whatever healing is most effecient, which at the time is a CH chain. Like I said earlier, this works well with a non casting, non AE mob but CT gave us lots of headaches with the knockbacks. From the description above perhaps we can keep the effects down to a minimum.  /pray<br />
<br />
I'm most interested in hearing how this &quot;team&quot; of healers/warriors coordinate amongst themselves. It does sound like it's out of our scope at the moment; especially if we can't use /disc defensive and more than normal communication seems to be essential.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quilawan EM</div><div class="date">10-28-2001, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DMF takes away the knock back effect but is not very good if you plan to zerg him. For agro control have all the melee take off auto attack now and then and make sure they are not kicking/bashing/taunting. If you have 4 MA's you should be able to rotate them in and out (when one dies the next one comes up to bat, res the one that died, heal him, and by the time #4s dics is gone #1 should be good to tank again) For clerics just a normal stagger CH works, but because its a long fight have one or two on stick in duty (/zerg).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tundar</div><div class="date">10-30-2001, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the chance of sounding like a newbie (but hey, I am a newbie with regards to some things), what is zerging?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">10-30-2001, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a boatload of warriors with full Myrmidon armor, primal and SoD, so agro control and tanking is not a problem. Generally we have 1 warror that will keep agro for about 90% of the fight, only losing it when he is knocked back or feared. The rest of the warriors are able to tank during those times.<br />
<br />
We pull CT to the SW corner and push him north allong the west wall. Rogues position behind him and keep moving backwards to maintain max melee range. Main Tank stands almost directly under him and the rest of the melee people position in front of him slightly inside of max melee range and at an angle to keep driving him north and into the wall. That is the part of PoF where the zone wall is an invisible barrier at ground level. Some of the clerics stay to the side of CT and move with him, some stay behind the main mass of melee people.<br />
Everyone has DMF on to reduce the knockback. People with jboots should have it up in their first buff slot so that the AE snare takes its place. This is so that when you get hit by the AE dispell, it removes the snare and you can click your jboots again. Anyone with jboots can keep from losing any buffs.<br />
<br />
Our last run, we only had 2 deaths. 1 cleric died to rampage after the first heal on the main tank, and a warrior in my group died cuz I got punted by the knockback while casting CH and she got summoned back before I could recover.  =/<br />

There are 2 ways of doing it. #1-All casters (and tanks if you can get them to) bind where you fight the mob, when people die they walk up to there bodies, loot the weapons and BP, and start fighting (or casting). Another way that works during long fights would be resing in the dead tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, that's bind-rushing. Zerging is when everyone blindly rushes the mob (either all at once or in waves-ie: tanks, then 20 secs later casters) with no mind to strategies like MA/SA, CHeal rotations and the like. Taken from the game Starcraft, IIRC (may be wrong on the game, but the rest of this is accurate), where there was a race of aliens named the Zerg who built inferior ships, but could produce them in insane quantities, so they could afford the losses that this tactic causes. Most people get their first taste of this on the old world dragon (Vox/Naggy) raids.<br />
<br />
On most higher-end raids, this is also known as &quot;a quick way to die&quot;. =)<br />

<br />
Hon!<br />
<br />
P.S. We use an MT and heal rotation for CT.  Works just fine though the first time I was wondering if it really would work.<br />
