Ive come close to dying in mm a couple of times but havent so far.  However, the exp is pretty good there, and there did not seem to be a shortage of tagets on the few times i went.</div></div><hr />

After that you move to the graveyard. If these areas are not crowded, you'll get great exp from them. <br />
<br />
The problem with Mistmoore is the frequent ultra-high level trains that higher level types are always leading to the zone. Often the trains are so frequent that you can't even get into this zone.<br />
<br />
So, if you are the sole party in the CY or GY and there aren't any higher level types in the castle, this zone is awesome. Other times it can be a major pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />

Its a great place if you trust your party. In regard to trains....We had one guy who pulled over 10 trains on us...A Gypsy Dancer did close to 550HP of damage to me in under 5 seconds. Thank Karana for Divine Aura...<br />
<br />
Just still dont get why I can get stunned when I am Invunerable!!!<br />
<br />
great XP in MM for sure and I made almost 50PP last night.<br />

In this room , deathly heralds, ushers, scribes, and will sappers and pillagers spawn.  They are chained to the wall, so you can kill them one at a time (unless one of them is a caster, thenyou have no choice).  In order to keep from getting trained from castle and attacked by wandering mobs, just head into the basement to meditate and rest.  Also, when there is nothing to do after the SR is clear, you can pull nearby glyphed from the CY into the SR.  An additional tip: get an enchanter who can mez, they make the fighting SO much easier. Another benefit to camping the SR is that the Icon of Sacrament (required for Caduceus of Sacrament) spawns in the middle room.  It's no drop, so don't let anybody else loot it =).  Lots of nice FS and loot can be found here, I made 2 bubs of xp in under 3 hours camping here! Good Luck!<br />

One several occasions I was fortunant enough to group with a bard who did have the song, and as soon as someone screamed out, &quot;TRAIN&quot; at the top of their lungs, we were out of sight.  Literally.  I mean we were gone!  This was in the Graveyard, so you should expect that the bards who are interested in joining the group will have the impressive song.  And of course, their healing song is a good mana saving aide for those minor scratches after battle.  ^-^</div></div><hr />
