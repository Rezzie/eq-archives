I currently have less than 20pp total and would like to know where I can go to make some decent money in order to buy my spells. Ive been running in oasis recentlyat orc highway and the exp has been pretty good but money could be better. Anyone have any suggestions? How would highpass be for me at this level?</div></div><hr />

Sell concordance back for more than you can sell a gls to a pc for.  <br />
<br />
Some people get their gls on wisp island. I preferred hunting commons.  There are also wisps in nk, but that seemed more dangerous to me, so didn't do it.<br />
<br />
Regular ls can also be turned in but the book received is no more valuable than the ls, so not worth the trouble.  I just sold the LS themselves to the merchants.<br />

edit note- rereading the post, I guess you meant loot AND xp, which this would not do.  <br />

The MOBs occasionally drop ringmail, which sells for 2-4pp per piece in Highpass. It is especially good if you can win a lotto for a PGT, CDS, SBH, etc...<br />
<br />
The EXP is really good there too - whether it is the Gnoll or the Orc side... both have fast spawn times.<br />
