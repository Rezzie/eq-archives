<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamea</div><div class="date">01-15-2001, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went here as soon as I hit level 14 and got all my new spells (most important: bind)<br />
<br />
I soloed from 14-16, and then again at 19.<br />
<br />
The story:<br />
<br />
I grouped with 2 monks, 2 shadow knights, and a necro. We were all level 14-16. We cleared the main floor to the top without needing to stop and med or rest (except me). Everything was blue to us so it was very easy, almost boring to some members. We went to the basement to kill Furbies (badger looking critters that squeak when hit). There are a couple of rooms that spawn 2 or 3 furbies which made it very tough for us. Also in the basement, there are a few tight, narrow halls and corners. At times I could not get a heal on a group member that was around a corners cause others were blocking the hall. We only encountered one death the whole night (Monk was jumped by 3 furbies and poisoned when he went off into a room by himself).<br />
<br />
The following night, we stayed outside the tower, at the base of the ramp (five of us, levels 15-17). We pulled mobs from the train that walk by the tower (kinda like the Orc Highway in Oasis (I HATE Oasis!) ). We were getting whites and yellows for 3 hours of non stop killing. We stopped twice so each member could go afk for a break. It was very safe outside the tower. The loot was poor to fair, I got a 9 AC Rhino Hide Tunic. Most items were Iskar quest stuff, rusty weapons, gold-silver-copper, etc. <br />
<br />
I went from a fresh 14 to 16 solo in two nights, 16-19 in another two nights with a group. If you love to kill skels, then you gotta try this place. Undead Heaven !<br />
<br />
In 4 nights, I never died once (2 close calls when solo) and we only lost the one group member (his own fault). Use Devine Aura to save your life. The zone which is at the entrance to the tower is a great way to escape certain death whether you are hunting inside or outside.<br />
<br />
Beware the two pit holes in the basement. You Do NOT want to fall down those holes, 250 points of damage, plus you fall into a nest of nasty Furbies. <br />
<br />
Iskars do not have clerics, but they do have shamans. I only had 2 requests to join a group because they are not used to seeing many clerics in this zone; clerics level fast, then move to Lake of IllOmen at level 19 or 20. If you want to group, trust me, just &quot;level X cleric lfg&quot;, you will have NO problem getting a group. If you decide to solo inside the tower, folks will constantly approach you and ask you to join them. Inside I did not run into any pests (the ones that plead that they can't solo on their own). The zones are usually very quiet, only an occasional single spammer that won't shut up (you guys know who you are).<br />
<br />
If you like trains, go to Unrest (good loot)<br />
If you like trains, go to Crushbone (good loot)<br />
if you like trains, go to Oasis (poor loot)<br />
If you love to kill skels with no trains. go to the Tower !<br />
<br />
I only saw one train in 5 days.<br />
<br />
Side note:<br />
A female dark elf shadow knight showed up and two Iskars (first time characters) asked me, &quot;What is that thing ? a player or mob ? Can we kill it ?&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marvill</div><div class="date">02-19-2001, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did Kurn's solo for a few levels, and I definetly agree, it's GREAT experience.  I think a group of five is overkill though, a cleric with a moderately twinked tank or two can really clean up here, especially on the upper floors.<br />
<br />
I'm in the Lake now at 17, taking out the yard trash with a group of between 3-6 (picking from one of each of the following, depending on who's on: cleric (me), mage, wizard, bard, shadow knight, rogue.)  The XP was great at 16 and still good at 17, it's highly recommended.  As a cleric, I usually get a couple tells a night asking me to join a group, and there are ALWAYS level 20-30 groups shouting for a healer.<br />
<br />
One warning--AFAIK there's nowhere to buy spells or train in Kunark as a good race...  So consider training Dodge and picking up a spell circle or two before you leave the mainland if you don't have anyone to port you around.</div></div><hr />
