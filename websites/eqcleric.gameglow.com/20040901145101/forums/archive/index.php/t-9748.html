Well, I awoke in Dagnor's Cauldron...did a /who of the zone and found I was the only one in there.  I figure, what the heck, I'll look around for Bilge a bit...so I go to the hero's camp (I hear he hangs there sometimes)...nada...look a bit more, no luck.  I tell my guild I'll go over to the island, then I'm giving up, well nothing there either.  Then I get ambushed by 2 tidal lords, after fighting them off, I'm left with no mana and 50% health...then I hear something I'll never forget...&quot;Bilge Whateverhislastnameis begings to cast a spell.&quot;  &quot;Your feet adhere to the ground&quot;.  Needless to say, it didn't take him long to finish me.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif  Well, I'm bound just outside of Unrest, so I figure I can go there and get him back, get to the island, loot my corpse, can't find Bilge.  Look and look and look...finally go to the top of the island JUST to see a dwarven NPC finish him off!!!!  AHHHHHH!!!!  At that moment, I figure I can be a dwarf that kills dwarf NPC's...LOL  Course, I could never do that.  How much you wanna bet he had the totem on him?   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif  Hope everyone else has a bit better luck!  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

If it makes you feel any better, he probably would have ganked you even had you been full mana/health.  &quot;What's that?  It doesn't?&quot;<br />
<br />
I hear ya  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Good luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ming</div><div class="date">12-17-1999, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG, that so sucks, LOL. I can only imagine...I think I'd definitely have to smash the keyboard just for starters. Last night I spent 5 hours hunting bears in WK. Let me just say, clerics are probably the very worst class in the game for this. Sure, I could kill them with 3 hits of the caduceus, but my average kill ratio was 3 per hour, and when it rains...forgedaboudit. I figure 1 in 100 bears has a HQ pelt. That's 34 hours per HQ pelt. My druid associate's kill ratio was 20/hour, more if he Tp'ed to other zones. <br />
<br />
then later...after I ran sceaming into NK to find regis (as if) he sends me a tell saying &quot;get yo ass back here, NizPon is up!&quot; So I get into WK and about 30 secs away and some idiot hails him. DOH there goes my hollow skull. Then when I have to go to bed...my guild gets invited to PoH by one of the big cheese guilds. Grrrrr. But this is about you...not me, and I feel your pain. Bilge MUST DIE!! (I got him within 2 hours of slaying everything in sight near the gobbie camp, BTW. Dont know if it was just luck, and havent see him since)<br />
