<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tkith</div><div class="date">02-18-2000, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK..I go home from the office for lunch and log in my cleric..figure I check to see if anyone in guild needs a res and restock my gem supplies and food for Fear...I start Running around Gfay.<br />
<br />
I get a tell from someone that I have met, but not intereacted with much.  They sounded different from when I first talked to them.  And their familiarity with terms and places was awful.  Hence my scenario upcoming.<br />
<br />
Can you come res me?  I am Near FP.  OK..I can res u, if you can get me a ride there.<br />
OK..so he gets the ride and says he died in WC...near the zone line.  OK.<br />
<br />
So a wiz then TPs me from Gfay to Sro.<br />
<br />
Wiz says to me...Wonder why he didn't want me to TP you into WC?  I dunno...I just run the distance...no worries there...especially since he's near the zone line.  SO I run (no SoW)..Across EC to WC...Look around..nothing<br />
<br />
Where are you?  I'm near the zone.  Near the sand or on the grass?  I'm by the docks.<br />
<br />
Docks?  WC?  Hmm..Are you By the kithicor zone or by the EC Zone?  I'm in West FP..<br />
<br />
Oh...why originally did you say WC...SO I hop on my hobby horse (still no SoW) and head to FP..I'm KoS there..But I hang out by the gates and send him a tell...Nope..he's still in the zones with the Docks..well thats East FreePort...but I know the tunnels..so I run through the tunnels...come out in North FP..invis with a potion and head out to the newbie zone.  OK...so where are you?  I'm by the docks...OK well I'm in the newbie zone invis just outside of the guards range. he says he has an invis for me.  I tell him to drag the corpse out into the newbie zone and I'll res it..<br />
I turn off invis so he can see me...and an orc pawn attacks me while sitting...stupid thing..after I hit it once...it RAN right towards the guards....then heads RIGHT back towards me....Guards in TOW!  I zone into N Ro...<br />
<br />
Why are you in Nro?  The guards came out and I'm KoS.  Come back in and I'll invis you and you can res Thelon and then me.<br />
<br />
Hmm Now its 2 resses?  I've been running around for an hour (my entire lunch), to res someone I don't know and following their REALLY poor directions..and now its 2 not one...(normally I wouldn't begrudge 2...but it was REALLY getting to me at this point)..<br />
<br />
I'll pay you..really well..<br />
<br />
Like I care right?  <br />
<br />
SO I tell him...I'm not doing it..I have wasted so much time just TRYING to get to you to help you and you aren't making ANY effort to try to facilitate me helping you.  Forget it.  I don't need money, I don't need items.  You need a map.<br />
<br />
He kept sending me tells until I had to put him on ignore.  I mean..I don't even know this person..and they are asking me to res..I get it all the time and its not a problem...but you would think that they would make a MINIMAL effort to try to get the process going.<br />
<br />
One of the things I don't do is res in an area that I'm KoS....its just not done.  You drag the corpse to ME..I don't run to the corpse....and being bound in Fear...if I died...there would be PROBLEMS.<br />
<br />
All in all..it was just an incredibly FRUSTRATING experience.  There were times when he wouldn't/couldn't answer my tells.  My asking him his location was an exercise in futility.  it was really insane.  The level of Effort around a simple ressurrection turned into a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
Anyone else have an opinion on that?<br />
<br />

<br />
Over the course of 20 minutes I heard someone shouting, Can you help me find my corpse?....<br />
<br />
I saw the inevitable happening...<br />
<br />
I finally get a tell - can you Revive me?.<br />
<br />
I calmly point out that I need his corpse in order to do that.<br />
<br />
He disagrees.<br />
<br />
I reiterate and point out that only Necros can summon people to the corpses.<br />
<br />
He says 'Oh'<br />
<br />
He then says, if I find it will you revive me?<br />
<br />
(He is /anon) so I ask what level are you?<br />
<br />
He says  - level 5.<br />
<br />
Grrr....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I reread this post like 3 times before sending in a reply, and the whole time, I'm thinking WTF??? (Is this guy really in Norrath?)... <br />
<br />
After thinking about it for a bit, there's probably a good chance someone may have put the account up for sale and sold it to the person you were talking to.. Very very lost higher level NEWBIE.<br />
<br />
It's a possibility I wouldn't discount...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gniss Fleshmender</div><div class="date">02-19-2000, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's another possibilty, a sibling. I have seen young people playing an older brother/sister's char, and messing up like this. One person in GFay lost a cloak of midnight mist and a piece of jewlery of their elder brother's char, and was wining to the zone about how his/her brother was gonna kill them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WarLocke</div><div class="date">02-19-2000, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just recently made 29th, so I don't really have much experience with people begging for revives.  In fact, I've only cast the spell maybe 5 times.<br />
<br />
Once, I get a tell from a high-level caster in Innothule.  He had died in WK, and couldn't get there because the feerot was down.  He offered me 20pp to revive him.  Whee, free cash  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif.<br />
<br />
The next day, a bard and I tried the stone skeletons in LR.  We got squashed, and I revived her (I was bound in the zone).<br />
<br />
However, I will not do random revives unless offered compensation first.  300 mana is alot at my level, and my time is just as valuable as theirs.<br />
<br />
Now, if I see a corpse, I'll do a /who and see if they're online, and will consider offering them a revive.  I won't ask for anything, but if they don't compensate me, they go on my &quot;Must Pay&quot; list from now on.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, that list is only 2 characters long...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistleburr</div><div class="date">02-20-2000, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings!<br />
<br />
I was participating in a zone take over in Nektulous (kill all the guards and station players there to protect the newbies) when I get a ress request for Kith, some guy's friend (lets call the ress requester Biff and the dead guy Norm) died and is bound in GFay.<br />
<br />
I ask where the body is, am told right at the WC zone. Off I go, SoW faded before I made it out of Nektulous.<br />
<br />
Hit Kith about 5PM game time, no problem. Biff meets me in WC at the zone and says he does not know exactly where Norm's body is. I go in, wander around for a bit getting terrible and conflicting directions from Norm and Biff.<br />
<br />
7PM game time Norm tells me that he thought he died near the zone, but his comp had crashed and when he logged back in he was naked in GFay. Aha, the plot thickens! Why did they not tell me he died LD in there?<br />
<br />
I back out to WC before the critters come out and have Norm petition to see if the corpse is visible. Guide says &quot;Yes, visible, nowhere near the WC zoneline. Have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time Norm has hitched a ride from a druid and does not want to wait until daylight to get the body. I politely decline to go blundering about in there, but offer to XP ress the corpse if he gets it to zone and waits for daylight.<br />
<br />
They start swearing at me, I leave. They die three or four more times doing an insane nighttime CR from central Kith. About an hour later I get a tell from a guildmate saying these two are bitching to the whole zone that I refused to help them...<br />
<br />
Who left what they were doing to cross three zones for a stranger? Who offered to spend a big chunk of mana helping them get their XP back? Turns out they were both under 20 twinks. As the clerics of Brell would say -- Bah.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silvane</div><div class="date">02-21-2000, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After much frustration with some of the same junk I see ya'll posting about (just wait till you hit 50 and try staying un-anon...hehe)I asked a few friends what they suggested.  It sounds bad, kinda is, and I only use it when I'm busy and really can't afford to take time away from my group, but a friend cleric said to send a tell back saying &quot;full rez, 1000pp&quot; and they will leave you alone...hehe.  Or they will offer you a pretty good chunk of change.  Just don't use it if you do have the time to help  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
My worst story is I'm in Plane of Fear (obviously needed by my group) and get a /tell asking for a FULL EXP REZ!  I check the guy out...he's in east commons and is a level 9 guy offering me 8pp for my troubles.  Suuuure...leave Fear and travel across Norrath to WComm to give a full exp rez to a level 9...lol.  The guy could gain back the exp and then some in the time it would take me to get to him and med back up my mana.</div></div><hr />
