<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shinyhalo</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the pet got nerfed into total uselessness...anyone who thinks it's a good idea to cast it as a &quot;DOT&quot; instead of just comping a tank vs high lev mobs is lame.<br />
<br />
However, on a good note Donal's BP is very sweet...I would even say it's the best loot off Trakanon.<br />
<br />
Also, this post underneath says we get a group symbol...which is great for Trakanon raids since time is crucial and limited.<br />
<br />
So they took something good and gave something good recently...not too much to complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jovius</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the pet is beyond a doubt, useless.<br />
<br />
I do not agree that the breast plate off trak makes up for this. Very few clerics will ever lay hands on one. Nor will many people ever see Trakanon. I assume the BP has been in game since kunark came out, just because it has been found doesnt make it a upgrade to clerics..<br />
<br />
As for our new buffs, Im very excited by hearing this, sounds Awesome! Group Heroism.. cant wait.. Spent a lot of time in the Planes the last few days, and i cant count how many times i wished i had this spell. (dont have resolve either) Now i have a reason to trade in some more spells to  hopefully attain this...<br />
<br />
Group Naltron , this would be a God send. For those times when the whole group needs symbols but ya just dont have the mana to Marzin all of them, and Piznarn seems like a newbie buff. Not to mention 1 peridot to cast this? Simply would be the best thing since cheal!  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Now if only they would replace our pet spell.. with something Helpful. Maybe we can come up with some suggestions, and no i dont want overpowering aka ice comet.. hehe.. just something WORTH memming the spell, i dont think that is too much to ask.<br />
