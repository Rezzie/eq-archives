Several groups were there all night tonight, killing just about everything.  The Last Kedge fell 3 times- droped a pretty bad robe (Robe of Kedge) and some really really bad staff.  Anyone know if he still drops the orage quilted robe?  Any word on the Skull Fanged Stilletto there?<br />
<br />
Have had my FB earring for a long long time, used mostly for medding in water  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  Looking forward to hanging out in Kedge soon!</div></div><hr />

Mostly what we're concerned with is the Prayer Shawl, Hammerhead Hammer (or something) and Kedgemail Gloves (if Verant would fix, it grrrr!)<br />
<br />
Oh well, still lots of stuff to explore in Kedge, great exp too.  =)</div></div><hr />

Sharkbone Warhammer<br />
DMG: 8 Atk Delay: 26<br />
WIS: +5<br />
<br />
Found on Cauldronbubble, level 49 named shark.  Nasty critter, double attacks for 133 and required myself (level 40 cleric) and Sindael (level 50 cleric) both healing our tank.<br />

Time to open a can of Holy Whoopass!</div></div><hr />

We were a full party of 43 druid, 40 enchanter, 40 ranger, 35 druid and 35 ranger and me at 33.  On my server, Kedge was pretty well, empty.  I have only seen one other guild in there since itemization.  Of course we couldn't go very far.  We pulled the second room, after the long swim down.  The serrated bone piranahs and impaler swordfish.  Needless to say we didnt go much further, since these were /con'n yellow to our L40's.  But this zone is great, I was so pleased with it.  <br />
<br />
The only thing that really scared me, I had to divine barrier once, and i finally got it up right at the zone, with less than a sliver of health left, and I could of swore as i started the zone, my enduring breath was wearing off.  The 20 seconds or so of zone time i was freaking out, I wasnt sure If i could swim fast with no health, couldnt heal, couldnt gate, I knew the DB would be up for at least 10 more sec.  And from my experience, the Divine spells dont stop DoTs, so it wont stop drowning =)   But it turned out to just be one of my buffs right below it.  Not sure why I decided to share that, but it truly did scare me =)  <br />
<br />
And I cannot wait to get like 10 more levels, Kedge is sweet.<br />

We took two groups and fought everything to the Big Guy.  I don't think we even came close to exploring the whole thing, but we spend like 5 hours there.  Got the Sharkbone Warhammer-from Caulrenbubble (went to druid &lt;sigh&gt;), a Sharksaw cutlass- from Cauldrenboil (man does this look cool), a lamentation blade- from Estrekka Doomwater (25 dam 54 delay, 5str 4sta)- good stuff!! Going back later this week!<br />
<br />
The big guy and his guardians wacked up pretty good.  Corpse recovery generally means getting GMS involved as things get stuck in the wall, even when you gate and/or log off.  The big seahorses also can summon you- yikes!</div></div><hr />

Because we all know druids pray a lot.</div></div><hr />
