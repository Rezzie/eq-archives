<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbletoe</div><div class="date">07-15-2001, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is being posted at both EQCleric and the Ranger Glade since both my Cleric and Ranger were involved in this &quot;event&quot; that recently (July 14, 2001) on the Erollisi Marr Server.<br />
<br />
My Ranger was at the Giant Fort in FM, in a good group, getting xp and loot (got a set of Forest Loops for him).  All of a sudden, 3 burynai came over the hill.  &quot;Baby Burynai&quot; (cleric/paladin), &quot;Fluffy  Burynai&quot; (warrior I think), and a &quot;Diseased Burynai&quot; (rogue).  Shortly another &quot;Fluffy&quot; popped up.  These 4 GM controled Burynai quickly cut through all of the people that were at the fort.  I was fortunate enough to get my Ranger away and camp him out before being killed.  Since my Cleric was in the zone, I logged him in to help out everyone.  While I was there, my Cleric was attacked by the &quot;Diseased Burynai&quot;.  I cast Retribution on him, first was interrupted, second one hit (I saw the &quot;Was struck by the wrath of the gods&quot; message), but he took no damage.  This is a 516 point DD.  Only thing that I can figure is that he had a Rune spell on him.  In the end, it took a group or two of 50+ people to come in and clear them out.  An upper 40 mage in my guild arrived to help people out, but wasn't much help since his pet was destroyed in about 4 seconds, and he was barely able to get out himself.<br />
<br />
Presented with my view of the situation, I'd like to make a few observations about this &quot;event&quot;.  If Verant wants to have some GM events, that is fine.  I have no problem with this what-so-ever.  I myself do not participate in such things myself, and if I had known that it was coming, I would have logged in a different character.  But as it was, a good number of upper 20, low 30 characters were PKed (on a blue server) by opponents which they had absoluetly no chance in being able to conqure.  This to me is just completely and totally assinine.  If there is an &quot;event&quot;, then it should be geared to the level of people where the &quot;event&quot; is going to occur.  Next, we have the loot.  While it took a few groups of 50+ people to come in and finish up this &quot;event&quot;, the loot itself was geared to the level of the people that were PKed.  Dropped were a Lizard Mantle, a Golden Black Pearl Pendent, and a Jagged Band.  I'm sure that these were wisked off to EC to be sold by the 50s that claimed the prizes while there were a number of people that were camping the fort could have used such items.<br />
<br />
Worst, and I do mean the WORST of all, we have a GM show up in front of the fort.  I forget his name, but his title was &quot;the Oblivious&quot;.  How is that for appropriate?  He asked the people there if they enjoyed the &quot;event&quot;.  The unfortunate druid that was in my group that was killed 3 times by the Giants, and not by the GMs (thus, xp loss) voiced his disapproval about the whole entire thing, and I made sure that I told him that I did not have a &quot;good time&quot; during the &quot;event&quot;.  Neither did the vast number of people that I ressed for free back to their camp.  The camp which the GMs stole from them all with this meaningless, assinine &quot;event&quot;.<br />
<br />
Words can not fully express the complete and utter contempt that I have for Verant for this &quot;event&quot; whose only purpose that I can figure was to give an ego boost to the GMs that were involved.  And I sincerely hope that I am never again fortunate enough to be a part of a &quot;GM event&quot;.<br />

I saw the shouts of a GM event going on at the bird city.  Evidently, there were several GM controlled aviaks running amok and killing everyone in sight.<br />

Other than EQ story line GM events, everyone other event is nothing more than some uber GM controlled charactars running around killing every living thing.<br />
<br />
One day I was using EQcaster just for the fun of it, and I ran across several entries that pretty much confirmed what you said.  This has to be for the egos of the GMs, because look what I found.  There are several of these from level 25 to level 60.<br />

<br />
Wheee, that was fun trying to figure out how to get my bodies.<br />
<br />
I don't think GM's realize that for every 50+ that they reward with a 'cool' quest in a mid-level zone, there's a ton of folks that are getting randomly slaughtered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbletoe</div><div class="date">07-17-2001, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">By-Tor, while you do not loose XP from being killed by a GM, you do still loose xp if you are killed by a normal monster that was attacking your party before the &quot;event&quot; started.  Ask our druid.  He also had 2 additional deaths (was feared into the giant fort twice while just trying to get his gear back (he got 3 49 Reses from me though to soften the blow)).  Also, while there might not be any xp loss being killed by a GM, there is also no xp gained during this time either unless you can find somewhere else to be during that time.  And since we are doing CR now because the GMs decided that they needed to kill some people that had no viable way of protecting themselves other than to flee for their lives, I don't see this as a viable option either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moehann</div><div class="date">07-17-2001, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, thats what the GMs do.  They pick on people 10 to 20 levles below them.  if you *ever* see or hear of a GM event coming, log your butt out right quick, unless you have another character oh...about 10 to 20 levels higher than any mob in the current zone than you can log in quick. It is things like these that have me assured that VI is going to ruin their new roleplaying server.  If only they would let me set up the new server heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heilig</div><div class="date">07-19-2001, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait a minute.  I followed you until the part where you mentioned roleplaying.  Isn't that what a gm event is, roleplaying?  Is it ok for a gm to program a mob to kill you, but you don't accept a gm playing a mob that kills you?  At least if the gm kills you, you don't lose exp.  People gripe constantly that the content in EQ is too static, but when Verant introduces some dynamic content, people gripe about that, too.<br />
<br />
I've seen a few gm events, and in every one, there were zone emotes at the beginning that make it pretty clear that something's going to happen.  If you really hate gm events, that's the time to clear out and go play an alternate.  Yeah, it's an inconvenience, but the game doesn't come with a guarantee that you can play wherever you want, whenever you want.  <br />
<br />
Finally, remember that there are some people who really enjoy gm events.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I joined a GM event in Oasis a couple months ago with my Magician.  Here's what I found out (that wasn't announced at the start of the event).  All the GMs were immune to spells (fully immune) and pets could NOT attack them unless the GM attacked the caster first to get on aggro list.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, only melee types could even think of doing anything to them.  The rest of us could just be slaughtered.<br />
<br />
Gee, thanks for the brilliant event.  I'd rather stare at my spellbook some more and will choose that option next time over your yawnfest.<br />

Then hey, guess what?  You're gonna get your butt kicked.  This isn't rocket science folks - if you hear a GM event coming, consider that your hint to leave the zone.  If you are going to subscribe to the 'play where and when I want' mentality and are too stubborn to move, then you WILLINGLY ACCEPT the fact that you could get slaughtered.<br />
<br />
Hell, I'm a L55 cleric and I vamoose at the first sign of any GM event.  There's just no reason in my mind to deal with it.  Heh, kinda makes me wonder what's gonna happen if all of those 'spoilers' for the GM events around the time of Luclin's release actually come true and we've got dragons running around all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moehann</div><div class="date">07-20-2001, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a note of clarification.  I'm not against GM events.  I'm not against GMs playing MOBs.  I'm not against GMs being themeselves. I'm against stupidity. Here are the facts: 1.  Every so called &quot;event&quot; that I have heard of, the level of the mobs that the GMs control is FAR over the level of the normal mobs for whatever zone the event is in.  Why? For what reason?  To make it so that the common wisdom is that if you hear of an event, you run away fast?  To make it so that the GMS dont have to have any skill whatsover to deal with the players? I dont know for sure, but I know it is stupid. 2.  The vast majority of people who participate in these &quot;events&quot; all they get is death. sometimes multiple deaths, and usually these are xp losses.  This is what they call fun?  3.  It is the rare minority that ever gets a weapon or any type of reward at all from these events.  4.  Almost all of the events i have heard of end the same way:  a huge bunch of uber players start porting in from their normal playing zones, kill the Mob in question, loot it, and then go back to their planes raiding or whatever.  Sometimes they are nice enuff to res the poor lowbies or midbies that were dumb enough to hang around.  None of this remotely resembles roleplaying, in my opinion.  What is wrong with GMs coming in and playing Mobs that the local level of players just might be able to kill?  What is wrong with GMs coming in, not to kill, but to talk to the players, maybe to tell them of some new quest, or some such.  What is wrong with more players being able to get some decent weapon or some such at one of these events?  Or will that unhinge the total balance of Everquest?  I mean God Forbid someone should *ever* get anything without puttin hours and hours and hours of hard work into it right? These *events* , plain and simple, are usually not fun for the vast majority of people who get entangled in them, and i think it is a shame.  They show a total lack of understanding on Verants part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Explain to me why Verant finds it to be in their best interest to basically force people like myself into a situation where I need to drop what I'm doing and leave for the next few hours while they flex their juveline muscles and slay paying customers to get their jollies.  Because that's my only option...leave or die.  Well, gee.  I pay money to play this game and I would expect a higher level of service than that.<br />
<br />
You don't go bullying the customer like this and then expect people to flock to your events out of excitement and anticipation.  I was sorely let down at my first GM event.  Here I thought some roleplaying would be happening, perhaps something *gasp* mentally stimulating.  Not even close.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not out to tell them how to write the game.  It's their product, after all.  But if they want people to pay for the luxury of using it, they might want to entertain them a bit more instead of cause them inconvenience.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbletoe</div><div class="date">07-21-2001, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had I seen any zone emotes, I would have left then and there.  I don't like them, can't stand them, and see no real point in them (other than as I said as an ego boost for the GM/Guides involved.  &quot;Hey, I killed 10 newbies today!&quot;  &quot;Yeah, well I killed 12.&quot;  Bet they have a pool going too).  And the only reason that I logged in my Cleric was to help the others that were needlessly slaughtered for this &quot;event&quot;.  Didn't have too, but felt that I should do something.  Especially for those unfortunate melee types that are still bound in FV/OT because they couldn't find anyone in FM that would bind them there (I saw someone offering 50pp for a bind for about an hour the other day).  What did I except for all of this work?  As far as I remember, a Clarity (not that I can refuse those anyway short of dispelling myself).<br />
<br />
The only GM event that I've heard of that was well thought out and well played was when they put in the Butcherblock Battlehammer (or whatever that 30/70, 2hb, procs SHeal is).  They had to fight the orcs in Crush to get the treasure box stolen from Kaladim back, then had to get to and fight some DE guards in Nektolus for the key for the box.  That actually had a good deal of roleplaying built up behind it, and made sense.  Spawning a number of burynai to go in and slaughter people and then drop stuff that can normally be easily bought by the people that were slain (not the people that actually killed the burynai, but the people that were initially subjected to this &quot;event&quot;) does not even come close to a roleplaying situation.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lith Ahntalon</div><div class="date">07-21-2001, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, they had one of these events on E Marr a while back. 6am est I am looking for port in FV but, cant find one so I head over to dreadlands to get a port ( I refuse to do a /w all *insert port class* and send tells, I dont like it when people do it to me) figuring there will be a better chance of getting a port I the dreadlands. I zone in and am making my way to KC. While running along the north wall I spot a cleirc body close to the wall ( I can tell he is a cleric becuase the little dwarf had on golden quest armor) so I stop shoot him a tell asking if he needs a res, he says yes but, watch out for the giants. I'm level 60 and DL giants are no real threat to me because I always travel fully buffed and have my travel spells memmed (root/atone). About this time a &quot;giant&quot; about a head taller than my high elf and with a name comes up and starts whacking me for 40-50 hp a whack. I figure it is some sort of event  with a GM in mob clothing and say, &quot;hey brau I am just looking for a port out of here after I res this cleric, I am sure there other who want to play with you =).&quot; He rambles of something bout how he is gonna kill me. I say again &quot;look brau, I'm just looking for port after I help this fella out I am sure someone else actually WANTS to play with you.&quot; Again the I am gonna kill you thing and 3 more of his buddies show up. By this time I am down 2 bubbles of health and drop a Celetial Elixer on myself and take off after downing a Sow Potion. I out run them, run a cicle and come back the the dead cleric. The gimp GM's are still there and there a lot of poele WANTING to fight them at the KC entrnace. I shoot the cleirc a tell to consent to drag so I can pull him to a safe spot to res him, all the while &quot;giants&quot; are hitting me. Well, I get ticked and pop DA and spam a few of them with /rude. and drag ghte corpse off to KC and zone to shake them. I zone back and res the poor fellow back to his corpse and finally get my port. <br />
<br />
WTF is that? Why screw with someone who has no interest in &quot;playing&quot; when there are plenty of others wanting to &quot;play&quot; with the giants and someone who is trying to help someone else out. Sorry excuse for a GM event if you ask me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">07-29-2001, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GM Events = Crap.<br />
For the most part they consist of any or all of the following:<br />
1. VI staff playing uber buffed NPC's which swoop into a zone with no storyline whatsoever and killing all the newbs in a zone till a few high lvls come in and kill them, thus receiving crap loot.<br />
2. Some disjointed storyline is broadcast which no one can follow unless they read the posts on Harpy's Head Tavern daily, then a couple npc's appear and act out this &quot;storyline&quot; while slack jawed players look on. In the end a_newb_01 is chosen at random from the crowd and awarding an UBER item usually inconsistent with the players class (Qeynos Shield 75ac given to twink rogue on the Rathe) or title, or both (Crystal Claw of Veeshan/Scaled Claw).<br />
3. A VERY involved story is broadcast and a well thought out drama ensues, (Firiona Vie's return to Faydwer) and several gaping onlookers are given Realm of Hero's coins to trade for relatively appropriate items.<br />
4. &quot;A Mist Covers the Land&quot; is broadcast for months but nothing happens outside of a few annoying spawns of bugs or something (NK).<br />
5. Loads of weird spawns happen in a zone, having something to do with the EQ storyline, but no clear connection, along with quests which can't be completed because the items that the npc's refer to don't exist so eventually the whole thing just goes away. (LFay recently)<br />
<br />
I wish the GM events were better designed for the level of players prevalent in the zone, and were more easily understandable, and finally, required a little more of the players than simply killing a GM controlled lowbie mob or marching cluelessly beside an npc for 30 minutes to get a reward.<br />
But hey, at least they're trying.<br />

I have notised that lately theese so called EVENTs just are reported to be a low lev slaying event ..<br />
one of the last ones I tried to do was aborted/put on hold after the GM controlled necromancer had killed every player in the near area..<br />
the necro despawned before any highlev players could get to him and maybe kill him<br />
..<br />
I admit that I am not an expert on events but shouldn't there be something else then just kill alot of low levs ?<br />
(the necro killing event started like it should but then in the middle ended with alot of low lev corps and the necro just despawned)<br />
<br />
if this is the events that verant are doing theese days they might as well just skip them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yeardly</div><div class="date">08-08-2001, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Verant has done a good GM event or two in the past.  I read a /log file of the &quot;Scaled Claw&quot; event and it was real dynamic content.  I also have read about more events where a GM plays an NPC seeking help or guidance or information.  These quests sound like a lot of fun and usually end in a reward of some kind for 1 or more players who did a good job roleplaying or helping.<br />
<br />
The &quot;mindless slaughter&quot; GM events are the ones I have a problem with.  All of the sudden a high level NPC pops up behind you in a low level zone (Oasis, FM, WC have all been targets in the past) and kills you instantly.  All of the sudden you have to do a CR you wouldn't have had to do otherwise.  If I wanted to be PKed I'd play on a Zek server.<br />
<br />
As for dynamic content, this is not dynamic content.  Actually CHANGING the quests that NPCs give out, or putting in new NPCs with storyline information is dynamic.  The new DE camps in WC are dynamic.  Putting the DE camp in LFay a while back was dynamic.  The diseasing of the Karanas was dynamic.  PKing NON PvP players is nothing short of harassment.<br />

I thought I would save all those little gnomes getting stomped. Total magic resist. It was hitting, spell showed effects, but no damage.<br />

Total melee. Finally some necro came and his pet killed it. Seems to be a tanks game these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wastral Utterblight</div><div class="date">08-10-2001, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Around level 14 a month or two ago there was an &quot;event&quot; In the Oasis. Three named Spectres were running around the place attacking people. Thier names all ended with &quot;Locustlure&quot; or somesuch. I was disapointed because they were all green to me. Hows that for a high level slaughterthon eh? I think only one person died in the whole thing. But I did manage to get one of the Specs to attack me which was pretty cool.<br />
<br />
Other then that I havent seen too many events, but I did have a lot of fun when they changed the Qeynos Hills zone back at Halloween 1999 to have all Undead. On the other hand, a few hours before I got to the Hills there was a Event that had to do with the opening of the Fear Plane. Lots of newbies died, they had KoS NPC mobs parked at the zone lines. I witnessed a few evil players get killed while zoning into the Commons from Freeport, by a High Elf Paladin NPC. That wasnt cool :P<br />
<br />
Anywho, I think the big problem with GM events is that they cant do them because when they pop up people instantly try to kill them. Thats why they cant make themselves only level 20 or something because they will die faster then you could type &quot;Greetings wise (GM playing charactor) and what brings you to our humble zone?&quot; or whatever. And whats to stop a high level person from killing a mid level themed GM event and grabbing his phat lewt that was meant for a lower level player. The only events that are for low levels are ones that dont involve combat because then the items are awarded instead of looted by high levels. And those are spoiled because immediately when a event GM pops up they get attacked. The only way they can defend themselves is to DT people, or kill them, or port them to other zones maybe. Which just makes the players more aggresive to kill them.</div></div><hr />

I was playing my shammy with my rogue buddy and it was all we could do to survive at that time. We would beat off one wave and then another would pop right behind it. We kept a corridor at the South Ro zone line open and people were running like mad to get out trailing 3-4 mummies at a time. Needless to say we survived hehehe.

It was a blast people kept shouting that some event was going on near the docks but we could not work our way there at the time. So I never fully understood what it was about or the outcome. All I know is that in a miniscule way I was part of an event where I along with a friend held open a safe area for people to run to.<br />
<br />
Much like some of the previous posts though I have heard horror stories of some events but to be honest have never actually seen one first hand other than Oasis. Be well and safe all<br />

My guild accomplished this recently and guess what? It broke before it finished.<br />
You can read all about it on multiple msg boards like http://www.noows.com <br />
<br />
As for quest NPC's and GM controlled NPC's being attacked: They could simply spawn lvl 75 NPC's with 100,000+ HP and full magic resistance. Simple.<br />

This is a 516 point DD&quot;&lt;/q&gt;<br />
<br />
Fighting a GM is like PvP so you don't see the damage as you normally would.<br />
<br />
I've been lucy enough to loot two GM corpses <br />
From a gnoll invasion of SP (not the original grand re-opening event of Paw, but a latter hack'n slash GM event)<br />
1)great staff<br />
1)silver ruby veil <br />
<br />
In a similar Ft Mt Giant Fort invasion, some named gaint accompanied by named Burynai and Goblins came to take his fort back<br />
1) 2hb hammer<br />
2) polished bone bracer<br />
<br />
Rember kids, GM corpses are FFA loot 8)</div></div><hr />

Possibly, he was runed, but it was still highly annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twinskey Bab0linskey</div><div class="date">08-14-2001, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the health bar not moving is easy enough to figure out as well.<br />
<br />
1) GM mob's tend to have many more then their level would imply.<br />
2) Nuke's do less damage in PvP naturally (I forget the percentage, but it's somewhere between 15-30%).<br />
3) He prob partially resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kahlia</div><div class="date">08-22-2001, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh. I was online the night that Irys was at the faydedar spawning in the lake. I have a screenshot of 40 or 50 newbie bodies just everywhere. Maybe your corpse is among them hehe.<br />
<br />
Verant is pretty clueless. They constantly throw either level 50+ mobs in a 20th level zone or mobs that are immune to all magic and green to the 20s. For every 1 good GM event there are about 147.2 bad ones.<br />
<br />
The only GM events I've actually decided to attend were the one where Firiona and that unicorn were in LFay. Great storyline but a bunch of rude people started casting sentinel or whatever that spell is in a crowd of like 60 people and there were mass LDs. The GM's got so fedup they left and didn't finish the event.<br />
<br />
The other one I went to was absolutely amazing. It was Halloween night 2000 and in WC the sky turns red and werewolves start spawning 10 or 20 at a time. They were level 35-40 and would always travel in large packs. Needless to say all the newbies died horribly, but my guild and a number of others came in and fought them back. It was a ton of fun for me since I was about level 30 or 35 at the time and it was appropriate for me. My level 12 roommate died a lot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindarak X`Lottl</div><div class="date">09-02-2001, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bit of information I got from asking a friend who used to guide:<br />
<br />
1.) The events you're talking about (the newbie slaughters) are called &quot;invasions&quot;.  The GMs there have level caps on who can hit them...usually, it means that only PCs who get XP from them can harm them.<br />
<br />
2.) The guide titled &quot;The Oblivious&quot; should NOT have showed up.  It's a violation of Guide/GM policy.<br />
<br />
3.) The ShapeChange spells are usually cast on the players before they first log on.  (Something about templates, I think.)<br />
<br />
4.) The GMs, when playing as the MOBs, are considered NPCs...which makes them exempt from the 1/3 restriction.<br />
