<br />
Anyway on to the question.<br />
<br />
Hate break-in strategies..  I've only been up there once before, and since most of the Plane was broken everyone was fighting in the SW area.  I know that is the way that it used to be done, but since the patch, most people say to just break it at the port-in building.  What have been your experiences?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">05-06-2001, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's the same old break to west wall as it used to be with a couple caveats:<br />
<br />
1) don't go more than halfway up the wall or you will attract aggro and harm touches from above<br />
<br />
2) about halfway to the camp site there is usually a rat or lich and its best to have a monk distract it while the clerics are running by</div></div><hr />

My experiences with the new Hate breaks are as follows...  <br />
I like to use regular invis upon porting into Hate.  Make right turns to get to wall and go about halfway to 2/3 the way up the wall.  Once on the wall check aggro.  If safe, I then cast itu on myself.  I like itu much better than regular invis for the wall due to most wanderers I have seen being either rats or ghasts.  These two critters don't see itu.  Beware liches and banshees see all invis.  Don't be afraid to stop on the wall and wait til critter wanderers off.  Back to the wall....make a right turn and keep wall on your left shoulder as you run down it.  At corner make left turn and check aggro, if clear keep going to next corner.  This corner is where imp trap spawns at bottom of corner so be careful.  Again check aggro and make right turn.  Wall is still on left shoulder and SS is straight ahead from this corner so make sure you have no aggro.  NEVER TRAIN SS!  You will see folks usually at SS if you are not first one there from this corner.  Important to note that at any time you get aggroed and attacked that you must go to floor off wall, get loc and DIE.  SEnd consent to monkies or rogues to get body to SS.

Levels and gear probably help this a lot, the vast majority of us would have been 55+.<br />
