<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">08-28-2000, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for a place to solo at level 53. <br />
<br />
I tried the Burning Woods, but there were far too many greens now, and Gullerback always seemed to cause me troubles!<br />
<br />
I also tried the Spectral Keepers near Sebilis, but there seemed to be too many of them together. I couldn't seem to pull one at a time.<br />
<br />
I'd love to just find a little camp somewhere with some nice yummy blues that I can solo reliably. I'd prefer undead, but I'm not wedded to the idea. <br />
<br />
I have heard that the City of Mist is good, but I wonder if anyone has soloed there.<br />
<br />
Any ideas appreciated!<br />

<br />
Spectral keepers/champions in Trak are good exp for 51 and 52.  At 53, champs are still blue, while all the keepers are now green.  However, several still give exp at 53.  <br />
<br />
Last night, I tried moving to Dreadlands, primarily to be closer to friends who like to hunt BW and Skyfires when they log on.  I found that many voracious brutes, drolvarg ragers, and petrified cockatrices are still blue and easily soloable at level 53.  One of the giant types, mountain steep something or other, was also blue and soloable, but a bit tougher than the others.   Spiders are all green now, but when one decided to pick a fight with me, I still got exp for it.  I was hunting near the BW zone, and found plenty of mobs there, the biggest problem being wanderers, but rooting or fearing took care of them.<br />

I guess soloing can be good exp though, but still at 53 in DL blue stuff is still pretty low level, everything to me at 54 in DL is green, so that mean everything at 53 is just 1 level above being green, i dont think thats great exp. You could try some frogs at the entrance of seb, though they can hit pretty hard. but for me ive found best exp in Hands in karnor(with a good high level monk or warrior that can pull constantly) and most standard groups in sebilis. Out of sebilis, ive found disco1/2 and zone out(with 4 ppl) great exp. Thats all ive done and i seem to be doing pretty well, although 54 really sucks anyway.<br />
