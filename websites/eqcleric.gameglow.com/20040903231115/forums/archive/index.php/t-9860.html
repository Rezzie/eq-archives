<br />
Now.  Why is it that my friend the Cleric of Innoruk can sufficiently decieve the citizens of every good city in the world well enough to bank in her &quot;native&quot; form and my own home temple well enough to get an Aegis of Life without screwing up her faction at home, and yet I can't get a Fright Forged without going permanently KOS in Erudin?  And even in DE form 'cause I have a pre-change Guise, I can't wander in Nectulos without being killed (at L51, mind you) by D'Skippy the green wonder guard with his 250 MR  (root, break, root, break, die)?<br />
<br />
Boy, was that a run-on or what.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and where is my bloody Initiate Symbol?<br />
