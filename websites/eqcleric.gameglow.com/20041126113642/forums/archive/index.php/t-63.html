I had died in sol b, and could not find a rez.  I logged off, knowing a friend who could rez me would be on later.  When i returned, a cleric who had seen my corpse at the zone offered to rez me, but he got the 'corpse is too old message.'  I was logged off for about 3 hours after the death, and only remained online for 15 minutes following it.  Has anyone else experienced this?<br />

There are a lot of bugs with the ressurection.  I had a situation where I died in skyfire mountains and had to log off before I was able to recover my corpse.  I had a group friend drag my corpse to the zone line near BW and I logged off.  I logged back in about 4 hours later and was able to do the res just fine.  How did you quit when you left the game?  Did you camp out normally, or did you do the /q or /quit or something like that?  I have heard reports that not camping out will sometimes keep you in the game for a longer period of time even after you thought you had logged out.<br />

Well two days past and I still see his body there, so I assume he hadn't been on since death. Well later that night, he signs on. I'm in Karnor's with a guild group so I ask if he wants a res. Well everyone assumed that the time surely had passed, but just earlier that day I read from these message boards it was 2 hours logged time not real time as I used to always assume. So I run over to the body and tell everyone what I am going to do. Sure enough to everyone's surprise, especially the Bard, the ress worked. <br />

When i returned and the other cleric tried to rez me, he told me that sometimes the clock just keeps going even if you log off.<br />

Slight addition.  If you sit at the character selection screen, the clock keeps ticking away.<br />
