</FONT><HR>Ok I was thinking about this last night as I saw a friend of mine pop up beside me naked 6 times. He was a 35th level cleric and his group just kept getting him killed, they wouldn't listen to him and he was the one suffering for their mistakes. He was really mad so I jokingly said "Ya know, DA works wonders in a bad pull.*wink* *wink*" and he started laughing cause he got my meaning. <P>A few nights before I had been killin things in City of Mist with my 41 monk friend and everything was going peachy until all these high levels show up and sit on the bridge right were we are pulling and they woulnd't move and they kept killing everything. So the monk is freaking out cause she is really hot tempered and I was the voice of reason the entire night as she suggested to petition 15 basillion times. <P>So after the high levels leave to go do some epic quest in the city some high level, 53 i think, Enchanter is siting by the entrance with us and he runs off, only to pull his gigantic train right over top of us. Those of you who know CoM know that there are 2 zones right beside one another and he saw where we were and he didn't even have the decency to yell train nor to do it in the other direction, even though he had just been sitting right by us and knew we were there. so we zone and then come back in and i'm down HPs huge. So the monk asks him not to do that again, quite nicely i might add <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> and then he start being a complete ass about it and talkin all this **** to us. so this is the point where the dark cleric in me is let free so i med up to full and buff both of us, then I tell her to go run around the city for a bit and pick up all the undead she can and run back here. So she comes back with about 5 undead on her tail and she feign deaths and I had invis to undead on myself. the chanter keeps running by me in an attempt to train them on me so I run around like I don't wanna get hit, but these things can't even see me <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> in the end he had to zone at about 1 bubble of health left and never came back <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P><BR>So now after rambling I get to the point of this post. What I wanna know is, Have any of you ever just had enough of someone or some group and let the bad cleric just come out and pull some nasty nasty stuff? <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> Or have any of you had any ideas that you think might have worked in a case like this but never been tempted enough to use it? So don't hold back and be all nicey nice on me and tell me how it's wrong to do this stuff, let the dark cleric out for once cause ya know you've all been tempted at least once <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Well I had something like this happen once.  Me, a pally, enchanter, druid, and a couple of rangers were at the barrels inside paw.  We practically grew up here in the early thirties and it provided much excitement and knowledge.  Well one day this group of four trains us and most die and then they try to claim the spot at the barrels.  Well we knew and they knew that we had the camp.  They then said they would share it with us.  Well everyone knows that in play nice the gm's will make u share but this still did not seem fair at all to us.  There are plenty of other places at this level one can go and hunt and from my experience train stations such as this are not the most frequented.  Well out comes the old cleric spell blinding luminance.  On their first multiple pull I whipped this bad boy out and hit one of the three gnolls. That gnoll took off like he was running a 100 yard dash back deep in paw.   The rest of my group took off for the exits, but I had db and gate up so I wanted to see what it brought back.  Sure enough about eight gnolls appeared and since the kser group had been fighting two others they did not realize what was going on.  Well three out of four died and they immediately left.  This may seem mean u say but remember they trained us and killed us first and then wanted the camp. It sure was cleric revenge to me though and taught those guys not to ks camps.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Rackle is a nice, easy going cleric.  Until he gets pissed.<P>One time in the Tower of Frozen Shadow,on the sixth floor, a group passed us by and went straight to the loot mob, the Incoherent Spirit, and his Abram's Axe of the Stoic.  Many times before, we had advertized being on the sixth floor, killing everything except the upper floor (above the stairs).<P>When we realized that they had started killing it, we interjected that this was our loot mob.  They replied that their intention was simply to see the mob wielding the axe.  They were in trouble, so while discussing the matter, I healed them. Thinking that they'd break off and let us have the mob.  <P>Nope.  They killed it. Then I guess they wanted to see how it looked on their warrior.  Finally they moved on, to ValSera's level.<P>Not long after, I receive a tell asking me if I have all the keys.  I did, and replied to the affirmative.  It turned out that the group had had a wipe out.  "Oh well, that's harsh."  I'm not about to go out of my way to rez players that do not want to play nice with me.  Make me angry, and I'll refuse to heal, buff, and rez.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

Was in Karnors courtyard with a decent group during a time when the zone wasn't fully camped.  With no groups doing any nearby camps, we started having difficulty keeping up with the spawn (and also cause our chanter wasn't that good).  So I start ooc'n for help in courtyard (I think its better to ask for help than to just train right away).  Before we even give up the fight and head to the zone, I get a tell along the lines 'your train killed me. i need a res'.  <P>Now this isn't the most obnoxious thing to ask, but he was basically accusing me of training without yelling train and then causing his death when we were still fighting an epic battle!  Because he didn't ask nicely, I simply told him that I wouldn't res him because he falsely accused me.  (and really...how hard is it to get a res at the KC/DL zone?)  He then got all flippant and said that he would 'remember' this.  I simply added him to ignore.<P>It turns out that this guy was a level 57 member of Legions of Doom (LoD) on Innoruuk which is well known as *the* uber guild on that server.  Does being in an 'uber' guild give someone the impression that he can be rude to clerics?  <P>-Madan<BR>53 cleric on Innoruuk<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I was recently sitting in the zone canyon in OverThere...the nice long one that leads to FM.  A dr00d was having a high old time kiting up and down there, irregardless of the fact that he was a)training the groups who were medding at either end of the canyon, and b)training the poor souls entering OT after a hazardous trip through FM, often near dead.<P>Tiring of such foolishness, as well as res'ing the poor souls he killed, I politely sent him a tell and asked him to find another place to kite, and what his actions were doing to innocent players.  My mode of thinking being, if he wanted to kite, he should do so in a place where he at least accepted a LITTLE of the risk that goes with it.  However, my suggestion was rather rudely received, to put it mildly.<P>So I plopped my little High Elvish butt right down in the OT canyon.  The next time I saw him up to his tricks, I Enstilled his sarnak knights.  I then Atoned them, and proceeded to nonchalantly nuke the daylights out of them.  It was rather fun, and I encouraged another cleric and chanter friend to join in the fray...amazin' what we'll do when bored, isn't it?<P>Needless to say, a_pissed_off_dr00d_01 started accusing me of KS'ing.  Me, a noble cleric?  Naw...."d00d, you were running towards a zone with mobs on you.  Looked like you needed help, so I gave it. I sure didn't want you to die. (snicker)  And I'll keep on giving it, as long as I see any mobs running after a player in this canyon."<P>He did try the trick one more time.  This time I let him get the mob just a smidge away from dying, then it got mem blurred and retributioned until it went to meet it's maker.  <P>Apparently he tired of wasting his mana for no good reason, and left the area.  Some people will never learn; just because they have the capability of doing something, does NOT give them the right to endanger others.<BR>I still laugh about this, btw.<P><P>------------------<BR>Benezetta Pia`Adiuvo<BR>Tunarian Priestess of 44 Prayers<BR>Paradise Lost / Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Whilst in karnors I was just getting a bit of idle exp with a side moat group when a group at the captains would camp under the bridge as opposed to off to one side of it.<P>Basically every pull for 3 or 4 attempts by our puller resulting in it going to their group, there were a number of different groups as well having the same type of situation.<P>They were responding "stop training us", Zone responds, "move then".<P>Well this goes on for a while and we get a tad pissed that we can't kill anything from inside the castle.  Being a dorf with a short fuse I decide that enough is enough.  I deliever an ultimatum that they have 30 seconds to leave the area.  I then move into the area and fear every mob they have.<P>All their mobs run into the castle, their tanks leg it after them, I run back to my group.  Next thing ya see is the annoying group hi tailing it to the zone with about 10 mobs on em.<P>Don't mess with dorfs!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>The best time I ever had with a "Trainer" was as a lowbie in Paw. Some d00d kept training my group near the zone in (somewhat unsuccesfully). After awhile I informed him that he'd better pull from beyond the double doors if he was really trying to kill us. Well, he promptly did just that and we still killed everything he brought without a single death. This shut the f***er up good. The guy left immediately after that, feeling like a totally useless piece of $hit.<P>------------------<BR>Seolta the Strategist<BR>Drunken Mick of the 60th Pint<BR>Blood of the Spider<BR>The Rathe - Team Powerfire<BR>http://www.drow.org</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
