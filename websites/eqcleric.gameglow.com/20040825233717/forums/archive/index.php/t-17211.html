<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mherina</div><div class="date">10-22-2003, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're seeking fun, involved, intelligent players whose characters are 45+. and who wish to be a part of a guild thats more than a social club, but not a full-time job. We run one scheduled guild event per week currently, though that could increase as our population grows. Recent raid destinations have been Cazic-Thule, Hate's Fury, Kael, etc. we're not doing planes or high-end luclin destinations yet, though they may become an option in the near future. We have little tolerance for self-centered, greedy or ignorant players, so if you fall into that category please do not waste our time or yours. We run things simply, so we can get on with the fun, and try to maintain a laid-back additude at all times. Nebula people are good people, and we're looking for a few more good people to join us. We are a US guild, on the Saryrn Server, with most of the leadership being in the Eastern time zone, so you will get the most out of our guild if you can play evenings with us. If you are interested in joining us, visit our website (http://www.eqnebula.com), please register and post into the &quot;want to join&quot; forum.</div></div><hr />
