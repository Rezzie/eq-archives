<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JanSorensen</div><div class="date">09-03-2001, 05:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Killing difficult mobs is one of the things that drive many of us. Often you do need skill, tactics and gear - but sometimes these can partially be substituted with numbers - heck, sometimes you almost have to in the case of a mob with large regen.<br />
<br />
Now, while its fun to raid with 50-70 people killing tough mobs I often find it even more fun facing a challenge with 2-4 groups. I know, for some mobs we could just bring fewer people, but seeing that it is possible to bring more to up the chance of success thats not always done. Further, the fact that we *can* bring more people makes VI tune the mobs to &quot;require&quot; it more often than not.<br />
<br />
Now, what I wish for is something like the following:<br />
<br />
A dungeon (or part of a dungeon) thats limited in the following manner:<br />
- &quot;Opening&quot; the zone costs 5kpp (arbitrary ammount).<br />
- Once opened you can zone in within a 5 mins window - after that the zone is closed and cannot be reopened as long as there is someone in there.<br />
- A maximum of 24 can zone in (arbitrary number)<br />
- If you die in there your corpse if left outside (no battle rezzing - no messy cr).<br />
- If you go LD in there you die and your corpse is left outside.<br />
- When you zone in you are given a &quot;buff&quot; that kills you after 2 hours (or any other set amount of time)<br />
<br />
Now put in mobs that would *really* challenge a group of 24 with no battle rezzing and only 2 hours and I think it would be a lot of fun and bragging rights.<br />
<br />
This isnt really limited to the high end I admit - but at the lower levels people hardly ever do stuff with more than 1 group anyway so its less needed.<br />
<br />
I freely admit that there could be problems with regulating that someone doesnt ninja zone in after you pay to open - but I am sure it would be solveable somehow. The fact that the zone could be camped by competing teams is really no different than any other camp though so I dont see that as a major problem.<br />

<br />
If you want to clear sky with 2 groups and VP with 3, why not? There is nothing stopping you.<br />
<br />
Verant doesn't need to enforce rules on you just to make a challenge out of it!<br />
<br />
My guild is very small and we take pride in all the things we do with our small numbers, such as all the Royals, Statue, Vindicator, North TOV, etc...<br />
<br />
The last Yelinak we did, we had 38 people. It was challenging, I'll tell you that! And it made the victory much greater.<br />

<br />
Considering we are doing the Royals, North TOV, Lendinaria, ST, and so on, we are lucky to see 35 people on at a night. If you want to fight Aaronyar, Sontalak, Vyemm, Zlexak, etc, those are pretty small numbers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">09-04-2001, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rather like the idea.  On my server the high end game is getting pretty crowded.  People are fighting over Severilious, Trak, VP key mobs, ToV and so on.  <br />
<br />
I think Verant really hasn't taken a long term view of what is going to happen as the high-end gets bigger and bigger.  Right now VP on my server is being done by maybe two guilds, but when we get 5 or 6 in there, it's going to be ugly.<br />
<br />
I'm really sick of the guild races to mobs.<br />
<br />
Also, if you could see who is in a zone without actually going there, it'd be a big help as well.  No more assembling your guild outside a plane to find out it is currently camped, or was cleared a few hours ago.<br />
