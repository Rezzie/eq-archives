<br />
Vyemm is one of those.<br />
<br />
And CH is a bad idea against him, imo.<br />

<br />
I don't really understand why someone wouldn't use CH against Vyemm. Just heal one round of melee and CH is almost certainly already more efficient than DL. Avoiding the knockback isn't exactly hard if your melee (and you) know what you're doing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">11-11-2001, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My alliance decided to tank dragon faction for a weekend and do ToV north for the first time. After negotiating a rotation with the guild thats been farming it, we moved on in.<br />
<br />
The only hard fight really was Zlexak, had 4 wipeouts on him due to bad positioning, finally got him positioned well on the 5th try and took him out with 2 adds.<br />
<br />
Lord Vyemm really was a letdown from all we had seen about him being the hardest fight in ToV. Basicly just found a place where there was a ledge clerics/caster could hide behind and pulled him to the other side of it. Used a 5 cleric CH rotation with 3 necros feeding us. Really was an uneventfull fight exept for when one cleric broke rotation after enrage when someone accedently opened a trade window with her, and an drake that spawned interupted one clerics casting. Had like 8 deaths on our first try vs him.<br />
<br />
Vulak'Aerr was probably the most fun fight I have had ever. 24 min battle with very few deaths, but a lot of agro control problems and laughs out of it as epic eqiupped paladins traded agro, and everyone kept yelling to let them die. We finally got it settled down and agro set on our main tank who used his deffensive disc 2x. Once Vulak was slowed, 3 of us were able to rotate CH every 12-14 seconds for the duration with necros feeding us. Scary was when he tried to gate several times when he got below 10% health. 10% of Vulak's hp is a LOT of hp when all your melees are 70% slowed and you only have one DB casting wizard and one enchanter to mana tap him...<br />
<br />
One thing that is very important on the fight vs Vyemm and also vs Aaryonar is that their AEs are bugged. Vyemm's ae will still knock you back when you resists, and Aaryonar's will still drain your mana, even if you are out of LoS of them. The fix for the bug currently is to turn serverfilter on and NPC spells off. It keeps your client from actually seeing the spell cast unless you are actually in the AE and don't resists, then it still has full effect.<br />
On Aaryonar, if you don't have serverfilter on or NPC spells off, and are out of LoS of him and get effected by the AE, your mana isn't actually drained. Its a client side bug, if you chain activate an instacast item to force an update with the server, you will see your manabar go up. Hope that helps.<br />
<br />
All in all, it was a damn fun 3 nights. Now that we know the actual damage output and AEs of all the dragons, the spawn times on drakes and such, and have our pulls worked out, we hope to cut the clearing down to 2 short nights or 1 long one next time its our turn.  =)<br />

He's a blast to fight.<br />
<br />
We do, however, use a small cheal rotation.  I have yet to be tossed once by Vyemm, too.  Can't tell you why.  It's a phenomenon within my guild.  My boyfriend puts his cleric right next to me and he gets tossed all the time.  Anyway, somehow, we manage to keep our MT alive and, on this last Vyemm fight this past Saturday, one person died - I think it was my boyfriend's nuke-happy wizard roommate too.<br />
<br />
Yes, I gave you no strategy for defeating him but I give you hope!  That one day only one person in your guild will die and that will be the nuke-happy wizard. :-p<br />

<br />
Its not an exploit. There is a bug that causes you to be knocked back even when you resist or are out of line of sight and don't even get hit by the AE. If you turn your serverfilter on and NPC spells off, you will not get knocked back if you resist the ae or are out of line of sight. You will still take the full effect of the AE if you are in line of sight and don't resist though.<br />
