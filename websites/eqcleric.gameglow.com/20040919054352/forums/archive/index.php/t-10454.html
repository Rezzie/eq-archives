<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callin</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 01:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From level 16 - 18 the Orcs at High Hold Pass have been a pleasure to kill.  I rarely have to search for a group.  Just walk over avial yourself as a Cleric in need of a group and usually you are fought over for your services.<br />
<br />
The loot can be very nice, with many rust weapons, ring mail armor, words, and such falling.  With a vendor less than 2 minutes away, turning the these around brings almost no down time.  Be warned that the looting isn't every 6th, alpha, or such but more of just grab a loot when you get a chance with the over greedy being kicked out of the group.<br />
<br />
The spawn rate is very nice.  I usually sit and med, heal and buff ad watch the exp and auto loot come in.<br />
<br />
Also be warned at most times the Orcs are a free for all.  When there are two full groups running the Orcs are down in seconds and victor goes the spoils.  <br />
<br />
From level 14- 16 the Gnolls at the other end provide some very nice exp.  They spawn is much slower than the Orcs, but also giving you more time to heal up and rest.<br />
<br />
The City itself provides all you can wish for in supplies, bank, merchants.  Non-self binding classes can bind anywhere in the zone, so traveling to your corpse after a death is low down time.<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />

<br />
Dark Elves are KOS there by guards and citizens, right?  I've heard people say to kill Orcs in Kithicor for better faction... could be trouble with the new super-undead in Kithicor!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaliyah</div><div class="date">05-13-2000, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">High Hold Pass is basically a &quot;town,&quot; so you can bind there, yes. You kill the orcs in HHP to get better faction with the guards. but it takes lots and lots of orcs. On my server it's pretty crowded there ... hence I never got into the mood of waiting around for people to leave and form a group then. So I never killed that many orcs. But Id leveled from 19 to 20 there so that's still a lot. I am still KOS. (I am DE btw.) Probably ALMOST to dubious ... But anyway, if the orcs walk towards the guards/citizens, they slaughter each other. Be careful not to let the named orc which spawns every couple of hours or so wander off towards the city. He's not hard to kill and drops something nice that's actually worth something (the rare drop). Good luck there. About the FFA Callin is talking about, yes, its generally a mess and I usually don't mind if another group joins, but if they don't ask us before hand, I get pretty pissed, and being a mage with a wizard friend, it's not hard to KS from these people. I dunno how I would do that with my cleric hehehe. I guess wait until level 34 and do that memory wipe thing  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif)) That'd be reeeeeeal nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">06-12-2000, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've spent a little time there, in different pickup groups.  Experience is great, as everyone says.  However, I cannot recommend a pickup group at the orcs if you need cash.<br />
<br />
If there's only one group at the orcs, the situations I was in, it gets pretty hectic if you're the healer.  I was constantly on the verge of being OOM, casting a Heal as soon as I got enough mana for a single spell, with 2-3 people usually below 3 bubbles of health.  I had to med during the brief interlude between fights, of course.  Somehow, nobody died (even though after I called OOM and one tank was below 2 bubbles of health and still fighting, I had to specifically ask the Shaman to heal).<br />
<br />
This means that I was completely left out of the looting process, as the melees were looting as soon as the corpses hit the ground (even if the fight was still going on).  When I complained that I needed money, too, I was given a ring mail bracer and a bronze rapier.  Over 4 bubbles of experience at level 18, I think I got about 5pp of loot, and spent about 2pp or so on agates for Symbol.<br />
<br />
In a group of friends, it would be a lot better.  Or, if you don't need money, the experience is great.  But, if you need cash, I'd recommend the gnolls - it's less experience, but also less hectic, so you at least have a CHANCE to get some of the dropped loot for cash, and scalps for faction.</div></div><hr />

If you think about it, a cleric's main strength lies in..... thats right, killing the already dead. And what better place then Unrest for that. With Expulse undead, and Ward undead, you can pretty much solo all the way up to level 30 if you really want, or get in a group with a few tanks, sit back and heal, throwing in the occasional nuke and watch the exp flow in. Also, there is FS weapons as loot, the ever sought after bronze armor, and some ring armor on the Mummies in the first level of the house. (Can't forget the gossimer on the Hags, the BloodStained mantle and Tunic on the Undead knight, Thick leather apron on the barkeep, and the Jagged Bands and Dwarven Workboots on the Ghost that resides in the depths of the basement.) Thats just my two copper on the matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">06-22-2000, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to say that I'm not a huge fan of HH.  Not to say that I didn't hunt there, but it was defintely too crowded there during peak times.  I prefered the orcs in Kith over the ones in HH.  Decent loot, similar faction hits, and very rarely camped.  Oh, and as for the undead, camped those orcs for 3 days with an alt without once comming across any undead.  Maybe I was lucky....<br />
