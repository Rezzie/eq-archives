<br />
98% of the mobs are going to be killed with a MT and a few clerics which cast cheal on the MT in some order, its getting boring , yes BORING !<br />
<br />
Why is VI so stupid and domt make some mobs which are rooted and in the area you cant use cheal , wouldnt it be a nice chance ? And I dont mean that you should make gay mobs which DT every 10 sec. So you can start a click fest to get people back in.<br />

Sure it's not real exciting unless you're doing AoW or something on that level, but it doesn't exist in a vacuum either. There are a lot of supporting activities that go into making chain CH successful... spam healing, aggro management, proper buffing, positioning, damage output, and so on. If you find you're in CH rot every time and don't like it, request that another cleric take your place to give you a break from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, it would be nice if they had instead come up with some other way to deal with the tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ixif</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would be interesting is if they took away complete heal and re-tooled all the mobs to not need this tactic.<br />
<br />
I finally got bored of sitting around doing nothing and made a bard, best decision I've made on EQ yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSmiter</div><div class="date">06-26-2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But HOW do you make an encounter that doesn't benefit from an almost endless supply of HPts?<br />
<br />
The problem isn't CH, its the fact that players want to do it the easiest (least risky) way. Chain CHing gets the tank almost infinite HPts, or as long as the cleric chain has mana. The only way to make CH not useful would be to have the mob hit HARDER than it does now (that would just mean double the number of clerics/frequency of heals).<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe a way to make CH less functional would be to add extremely high HP/High AC mobs with insane non removable DS and 100 + per tick regen. Make them hit for a normal damage amount.<br />
<br />
CH wouldn't work all that well against this mob, too many people taking too much damage. It then becomes more about DPS control and balancing DPS with the amount of healing needed. Mana Burn would have a functional use, all other nukers have a roll. Pets, slowers, mana regeners... etc...<br />
<br />
Make killing this 10,000,000 hp mob about combat control and not about how you can use a macro. Have the mob summon decent level pets in on a regular bases just to keep things interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
Another idea would be to having more mobs that multi spawned into DIFFERENT mobs. We all know the Griffs in PoS. You kill one and it turns into 2 or 3 more of the same mob, etc... Why not have 1 mana resistant mob turn into to a mob that could either be a nuker, Cleric, A Necro, etc... keep the players guessing as to what is going to happen next. <br />
<br />
The idea isn't to remove CH chains. It's to make them not always the most desirable or usefull tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barahir Ironaxe</div><div class="date">06-27-2002, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have the slightest idea why youre whining about having to use CH chains.<br />
If it wasnt for the clerics, no raid would be successful. If the clerics in the ch chain wouldnt use their hotbuttons and supplying heals with the biggest precision, you would never see mobs like the AoW dead.<br />
<br />
Why the hell do you want to give VI the idea of making CH less successful against certain mobs? Because youre bored? Please I beg you.<br />
I have been in ch rotations for the last three years, and it is in no way boring. Maybe youre doing something wrong.<br />

Sorry, I have to agree with the boring statement.  CH chains are boring.<br />
<br />
The only CH chain I was ever in that wasn't boring was my first one.  I hit CH, got agro, hesitated on DA, and died.  Oh wait, that one was boring as well since I then spent the next 15 minutes at my bind spot waiting for a rez.  <br />
<br />
Yes, I agree they are needed in certain encounters, but they are boring.  Once you get the timing down, you sit there at your computer counting out the time and hit a key.  Ok, there can be some excitement when the MT dies, someone else gets agro, or a cleric in the chain dies or runs out of mana.<br />
<br />
As far as your statement about people doing things wrong, I would have to once again disagree.  In my opinion, if a CH chain is done correctly, it is the ultimate in boredom as there is little challenge.  <br />
<br />
Each of us plays slightly differently and likes different things about the cleric class.  I'm sure you aren't alone in finding CH chains enjoyable, but neither are those of us that find them boring.<br />
<br />
Perhaps instead of saying someone is wrong for thinking CH chains are boring, you could instead state why you think they are not boring.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nollo the Cleric</div><div class="date">06-30-2002, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not even Archlich needs hell of a extra healing cause of the 125 or whatever dot.<br />
<br />
I was asking for more mobs like glyphed in ssra basement , which for example FD you every 15 sec with an AE which makes MTing hard.<br />
<br />
Or mobs like VP dragons , with huge AEs and less hp. Of course then all guilds would cry for MB wizzies. Like cursed , only thing on cursed which is bad that you still need to chain cheal for 20+ min on the MT.<br />
<br />
All what VI did latly is  add more hp/ac to the mobs ,  root the mobs in a room with 8 to 10 adds which have a fast respawn time , give the mobs AE's so primal weapons wont work ( i.e creator or archlich ) and other stuff.<br />
<br />
So basiclly there are many different mobs out there if you are a melee . You think what weapon I use for that , or where I stand for this mob but chain chealing stayed totally the same since SoV came out. <br />
<br />
Other question to whoever said chain chealing isnt boring. <br />
<br />
Ever had to chain cheal for 30+ min when vulak gates on you the first time you try to kill him ? <br />
<br />
Ever killed cursed ? I think on our first kill it was about 39 min chain chealing .<br />
<br />
Emporer - first kill was 34 min chain chealing , glad I was doing add control with other tanks for this one at least.<br />
<br />
For me it doesnt make that much fun to yell in guildchat I need mod rods for 30 mins , then I can shout for a heal while I have about 2 or 3 sec to pick a mod up and use it befor I have to press the hotkey again.<br />
<br />
Of course , if you are talking about killing klandicar or some named in west ToV and you are done with the mob in 5 min it maybe wont be so bad for you to cheal but the 30 min + chain cheal fights suck.<br />
