<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">04-21-2000, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's Friday, and I took the day off from work.  Since I'm going to have to spend the weekend with the in-laws, figured I'd reward myself up front with some quality time spent killing putrids in SK, and hoping for a certain SK to spawn  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Sleep in a little, about 7:00 AM Central time log on and run there with my bardic friend.  Start killing putrids.  Couple of pally's wander by, but move on after they realize I'm after Gimrot.  Life is good.<br />
<br />
Then 8:00 arrives... and they announce they are taking the servers down in an hour.  What!?!?!?!  Sure enough, at 7 am Pacific time, the servers go down.  I Log out (like I have a choice) and look on the scheduled downtimes screen at Sony.  I'm thinking to myself that I must be losing my mind, because I'd swear that the last patch said &quot;LAST PATCHE UNTIL AFTER KUNARK&quot; or some bold comment to that effect.  But now there is suddenly a &quot;scheduled patch&quot; put out as of late last night -- after I was already in bed...  You call that scheduled?  Feh  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
Of course, I guess I shouldn't feel too bad.  Knowing Verant, the rest of you are in for a miserable weekend of repatches, just like the last time they patched on a Friday.  Don't they ever learn?  [Obviously not]<br />
<br />
I hope I'm wrong, and all of you have a great weekend with no downtime!<br />

[Obviously not] able to find a clue<br />
<br />
A_Verant_Senior_Exec says,<br />
&quot;You're right.  We at Verant are not capable of catching on.  But then again, even if we were, would we really care about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
A_Verant_Senior_Exec looks at the huge amounts of money pouring in and laughs gleefully.<br />
<br />
A_Verant_Senior_Exec shuts down the server for another day.<br />

YOU have been fleeced!<br />

Erondil... still angry but at least won't have to worry about Kunark (since they're shipping via UPS and I won't be here to pick it up on Monday, grrrr.)</div></div><hr />

So I shrugs, try to log back in, and it starts downloading a new patch? Ok, I'm steamed at this point but I figure it'd be a quickie...Verant wouldn't do a massive patch in the middle of prime-time weekend, right? Wrong! On top of them patching at least 2 3+ meg files, their damn patchserver kept dieing, making me start ALL OVER AGAIN! Luckily, one of my fellow guildmates saved me from putting something through my monitor by distracting me from the game. (Thanks Sephy, if you're out there...*hugs*) Got up this am, and there's yet another patch, and found out the guildie I was grouped with didn't loot the corpse because he already had that piece...sigh.<br />
Someone hire Verant a proctologist. Please! <br />

<br />
A druid guildmate and I had run up and bound at the north wall camp in Fear on Thursday in preparation for a break on Friday. The sneak went well and we were pretty excited about the next day.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly...<br />
<br />
The break team which was to assemble at 4pm EST was unable to log in, some members not getting on until 11pm. We called off the raid  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
