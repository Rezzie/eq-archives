If you can get in a group when you are around L24-26 with those 25 - 30 groups in places like green pool and bowl you will get insane experience with decent loot. I went there last nite. Joined a group after healing some people that zoned out due to a train. We started as a full group of L25-30's with me being the second lowest. I started with just under 3 bubbles into L25. After about 3 hrs of constant pulling and fighting from the bowl and its surrounding areas (I mean CONSTANT, twice we had actually cleared the entire area of mobs) and 1 hr of just me, 1 tank, and 1 druid constantly pulling from maze, I was halfway through L26. I also made about 50pp or so of cash and 20pp worth of fine steel loot. Not to mention I made some new friends which I plan on grouping with for a long long time.<br />
