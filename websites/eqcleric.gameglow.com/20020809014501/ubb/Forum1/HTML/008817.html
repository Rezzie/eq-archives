</FONT><HR>A Cleric can leave for any number of reasons.  Dislike people in the guild, dislike the guild's direction, get kicked out, don't like general lack of abilities minus super-healer status.<P>Retention is also random, because it depends on what the cleric dislikes.  If they hate playing their class now, retaining them is going to be a chore because you have to overcome their notions of what they hate about being a cleric.  If its because of guild problems, then ID and try to solve the problems.<P>It happens all over too</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>To add to the other reasons...<P>1) Constant pressure to attend every and all raids.  one of the classes that if you dont have enough of, the raid is canceled.  You need 3 warriors, you need 1 enchanter, you need 4-8 clerics... sometimes as much as 10.  Its not easy being a cleric.<P>2) Constant res requests.  This makes 'your time' other peoples time.  You spend your time 'waiting' on other people who have died, and didnt bring a cleric along for xp.<P>3) Monotony.  Where as most classes can only do one thing 'well' and can do other things with a level of mediocrity, we do only one thing.  We heal and buff.  We cannot melee.  We cannot do much damage.  We cannot solo.  We cannot... well, do much else very effectively.  It gets tireseome only hitting the blue button.<P>4) Disrespect from other players.  Other players feel they are entiteled to a res, cause you're in the zone... the guild.. the server... the planet.  The dont want to help pay for reagents for spells you cast on them.<P>5) Pressure for Success.  If a raid fails, all fingers point to clerics first. often if a raid fails, its because the clerics either screwed up, or couldnt heal successfully enough anyways.<P>6) Lack of Gear.  Where as most classes get 'toys' or get 'powerful items' clerics only get additions to their hp/mana base... and sometimes we get a weapon that actually can kill rats.  Sometimes we get flowing thought items.  Otherwise, we're the 'bastard' class when it comes to loot making, and decisions.<P>Anyways, those are my guesses.  I cant really say, I put up with all that crap just fine.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Level 55 is perhaps most frustrating - on a recent raid with my guild, a level 50 character asked in front of everyone something along the lines of "if I die, I'll be getting a 56 rez, right?"  I haven't raided a lot, but I always assumed in raid situations one takes what one can get as far as rezzes go.  But it was a little difficult for my pride to swallow =\<P>That's one reason I've thought of giving up my cleric.  Plus I have the worst luck ever, and when level 50 clerics around me are in full Ethemereal Mist, I'm in Seb Scale =\<P>Ozymandia Soulstealer<BR>55 Templar, Bristlebane<BR>Cazic-Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Bah, getting a res is more than already what you could expect. In the worst case, they would go without res.<P>Last Hate raid, I was the only Cleric with Epic, and all Clerics attending were 55 or lower. I died three times, twice I had to eat a 90-res (one death was during a total wipe, so I got ported up to res everyone). I lost about a blue as a result. Did I make a single complaint? Nope. It annoys me to no end when others do.<P>Next time the 50-ish char says he wants a 96 res, he better not attend  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>- Kaysha Soulsinger<BR>Templar in the 55th Circle of Erollisi Marr on Lanys T'Vyl<BR><I>The road to Heaven is paved with stones from Hell</I></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I would so much rather play my alts any more.  Preferably melees who cant buff anyone   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>But 99% of the time i feel obligated to play my cleric since NO ONE else in the guild will play one.  Ok, I have to take that back. We do have one other cleric, but she is on the 'second shift', as we call it.  ie: she works nights, I work days, we only are on at the same times on weekends. <P>So I wind up playing my 60 cleric with everyone elses Noob alt melee, and all of their alts outlevel mine, and they get exp off everything we kill while i get the occasional light blue and they wonder why I get bored and bitter and have spent the last TWO MONTHS in the bazaar working on tradeskills!!! <P>The other thing that really burns me are all the 'why dont you get your epic?' comments.  Fine.  You want me to have an epic?? YOU go sit in skyfire for weeks on end.  Take time off work and stop eatting and showering.  Sit and stare at that screen and wait for uber_guild_01 to ks your spawn (as happened to a good friend of mine recently). THEN you will perhaps see why I do not have, do not want, and refuse to camp the damn epic. <BR><I>edit:</I> the people making the epic comments are not guildies.  They are random_idiot_rez_begger_01 generally. My guild knows exactly how I feel about the epic. <P>/e takes a deep breath<P>And THAT would be why this cleric wants to leave.   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif"><p>[This message has been edited by Zzule (edited 06-28-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Heh, a lot of things said in this thread kinda ring true for me.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>People seem shocked when I tell them I have no desire to advance with my epic (I am up to the spawning Ixiblat step), and say the Ragefire camp couldn't be "that bad".  Right, I am in a small guild with only 2 groups max of 50+, and the 3 highest levels in the guild level 55s, most of whom are not in the same time zone and some of whom log in once a week or less.  Even if I could camp Ragefire (which with a full time job, I cannot, no way am I taking "vacation" for that!) there is no way we could kill him, and certainly not before someone else would grab him.  Thanks, but I'll pass.<P>My guild is pretty cool about not demanding rezzes, or if they need them, they arrange for the body to be brought somewhere convenient and provide the port.  <P>Camping something I can't solo but someone else could I am a bit lucky, I always have a 55 SK with me because that's what my fiance plays.  We also have a druid bot to port us around.  That does help a lot as far as always being able to go somewhere for exp, even if it is slow exp in boring places.  Without that, I probably would have burned out on my cleric earlier.<P>Although I really detest the exp grind, to the point that despite wanting to get 56, I still find myself working on tradeskills a lot.  <P>I also came to the realization that I do not like raiding, unless there is near perfect organization in it.  It seems all but one of the large raids I've been on was pretty much people standing around while the raid leader took forever to get things in order and then bitched at the 50% of the people who didn't listen and did their own thing, sometimes wiping out the entire raid in the process.  And the raid I went on when the master looter "lost" several blue diamonds when it came time to distribute them was not exactly endear me to the whole raiding scene either.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>I would hope it's different in raiding guilds, I imagine they would have to be more efficient than that, but I do not have the time nor the energy to commit to the sort of leveling and attendance requirements those guilds have.<P>Sometimes I am tempted to retire my cleric, but I usually stop myself, because I really do enjoy the character.  It's the constant demands of others (though /role helps with that) that really gets draining. <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=11175" TARGET=_blank>Altheia Selonyx</A><BR>55th Templar of Innoruuk<BR>Vazaelle</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Honestly, people leave guilds for alot of reasons, but being a GM of a guild and a cleric, I have seen both sides first hand. <P>If you are in a raiding guild that raids 5-6 days a week, it is very easy to burn out as a cleric. If you like this scenario(I do), then you are what I call a raid cleric. A raid cleric is someone that prefers to raid vs xp or tradeskills. A raid cleric online time is dominated by others. Raid clerics have to deal with alot of pressure. Some people dont like this. Some do. I have seen lots of good clerics, that were recruited for my guild end up not wanting to join after raiding for 3 weeks. They just can not do raids 5-6 days a week. They prefer a raid or two a week and the rest free time. <P>Burnout at high level raiding is a common problem as well. We routinely let clerics take a couple days off, so they dont get burnt out.<P>Loot - well in my guild, our clerics are not the step children. Most of the time I see large mana items, I tell my officers now that is a CLERIC item. But all loot needs to be done fair, which is hard to do. Also I truly believe if you have good equipped clerics, you need less, but all of them need to have approximately the same gear or mana pools. So we strive to make sure which clerics get upgrades are the biggest( as long as they play regularly.<P>EQ is 3 years old, if you have played since beta 3 like myself, you probably seen a few friends just retire. This is just a fact of the game. Nothing you can really do about this one.  <P>One thing we did to help our clerics is we have a  dot fund. I pretty much try to supply dots for our clerics at every raid. The dot fund basically gets money from spell sells, xtra loot not needed, and gems from raids. This i know has helped tons of my clerics from having to worry about xping for cash to raise money for dots and just plain frustration at being poor all the time. This helped to remove alot of friction. <P>I do not allow clerics to be blamed for failures at guild raids. This actually goes for most of the guild. I know that our job is stressful as it is, but to yell at clerics who never get praise when everything goes right, is just wrong. I know a few times this had happened and caused friction, but does not happen now. Yes i know who and when a cleric misses something. Human error, people make mistakes. I just tell my guild to focus on cr and take another shot. <P>Those are most of the reasons i have seen for clerics leaving the high end game. IE level 60 clerics. Those our some of the things i have done to try and keep them happy. It just seems to me that the high level 60 clerics are slowing dying. Most high end raiding guilds are constantly looking for them to join them. Hope that helped.<P>Lalu<BR>GM of Tindi'Losi<BR>The Rathe<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>BORDOM!<P>Its actually easier to play most classes as they increase in levels, and this is true for the cleric as well.  The cleric started out having to melee, nuke, buff and heal multiple targets on each pull. Rooting/stunning multiple inc mobs, saving the chanter, keeping the ranger alive and tossing that big heal on the tank is a thing of the past.  At lvl 60 fighting many mobs (and the big ones on raids) you cant root, you cant stun, you cant keep the chanter or even the ranger alive (if they get aggro they are toast), you simply heal the main tank.  BORING!<P>And raiding in the end game requires clerics and warriors, so if you don't go to the raid eventhough you are bored to death at them you feel guilty because your guild HAS to have you there to do it.<p>[This message has been edited by By-Tor (edited 06-28-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Flooglehammer - it's not just your guild. It is universal.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>I do not know of any cleric who will stay in a guild that does not or can not reimburse reagents cast on guild outings.  Going broke to buff a raid is not fun.<P>Clerics also tend to leave guilds when they're asked to leave the exp group they just managed to join after spending [insert inordinately long period of time] waiting for a group, just to rez a guildmate who died in [insert area at least three zones away] while soloing/farming/traveling/doing anything else a cleric can't do easily.   <P>Along similar lines, getting a tell from a guildmate of "You're still LFG, you must not be doing anything, can you come rez our group of guildies? We already have a lower level cleric/druid/shaman but we got wiped out and want a higher level rez."  The we-don't-want-to-exp-with-you-but-we-want-your-rez thing is very, very annoying.<P>The pressure, criticism and flak from deaths on a guild outing, regardless of whose fault it was, is also a reason.  I'll make a blanket generalization and say clerics are sensitive people, and probably beat themselves up enough over any missed heals.  Thus, getting crap from guildmates ("Y did u let me die!!!111 OMFG u suxx0rz!!!11") is likely to encourage a cleric to leave a guild, too.  Being derided is not how anyone wants to spend his or her time.<P>Being told, "You need to work on your epic" by a guild leader ... well, Zzule and Altheia summed that part up pretty well.  <P>I'm not sure what a guild could do to retain clerics in those situations, other than the peridot thing.  Helping clerics advance in levels and equipment is probably also a good way to keep a cleric happy and in the guild.<P>Being sensitive to the cleric's time and feelings - actually, that'd go for any player, regardless of class - would go far in keeping people from leaving.<P>------------------<BR>Vinta<BR>56th Cleric of Innoruuk (Terris-Thule)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

As I've said in other threads, I'm in a lucky circumstance (small guild, we play together exclusively -- we have cleric, warrior, shaman, wizard, ranger as mains, with a monk who often comes along, and twoboxed chanter and monk for times we need em). But about 4 months ago, most of my guild were all playing their melee alts (as was I, playing the two boxed monk) and my cleric was just sitting down nearby to heal / buff.<P>I still love being a cleric. I love grouping with my group. If I raided more than 2 or 3 times a week, I might lose interest -- but as long as we keep doing hard, fun stuff like CT, Kael Arena (easy but fun, and good drops), crawling around SG, etc, I'm in for the long run.<P>On the other hand, I left my first guild because I couldn't stand the people in /gu bitching about dying. They would ask for a res, then when I'd say "no, suck it up I'm busy" (I was more polite than that to most of em), they'd continue to whine about how much this death sucked, and how far they have to go, and yadda yadda yadda. <P>Once I started putting members of my guild on ignore, I knew it was time to leave.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=147676" TARGET=_blank>Tanilin Soulsoother</A>, <B>&lt;Ex Tempore&gt;</B>, Rallos Zek<BR>60th Erudite High Priest of Quellious</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing since Beta 3 and I have been in the same guild for over 2,5 years now.  <P>My guild has evolved to a heavily raiding guild and we spend about each day raiding (Ssra, ToV, Kael, Deep,...)<P>I have to say that my guild always treats clerics very well with lots of peridots, we are all nicely equiped, the guild helps the clerics getting epics an so on.<P>The only things that bother me in the guild, playing a cleric, is the blame.  If a raid is not successful, 99% of the time the clerics get blamed and this is the part that I, after years of playing, still have problems with.  People forget that there are many factors that can make a raid fail.  Positioning can be bad, aggro management might have been bad, slow might not have stuck,... but the first thing that comes to mind is : clerics didn't heal.<P>And this still bothers me.  I am a good cleric but the constant nagging sometimes gets to me.<P>The 2nd major point of frustration in a raid guild is the attendance.  For certain mobs you need 8 to 12 clerics.  So pressure to attend raids is higher than most other classes.<P>This last point can be a positive thing for some too.  The knowing that you are needed, can be fulfilling sometimes...<P>In the end, if you feel frustration about something, talk to your officers instead of plain guildremoving.  Make some of 'em play a cleric sometimes at raids  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif">  That last part, we use alot in our guild  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Venerable Pacemaker<BR>High Priest of the Rathe <A HREF="http://www.spiritoftunare.com" TARGET=_blank>www.spiritoftunare.com</A> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

I agree with most everything folks have said.  For me, I don't like raids.  Raids cost clerics a lot in terms of time and effort and sometimes even plat (reimbursement for reagents should be a baseline expectation from a guild, so that shouldn't happen to most clerics), but the benefits are not in line with that.  I'd rather attend a raid with my ranger, it's a lot more fun and carefree.  I remember a time in Kael when my ranger helped break into the arena with one group, then switched to my cleric so that a second group could form.  As a cleric, I defaulted the plate to the heavy metal tanks, then watched as chain was defaulted to the "only" chain class there (who was only there because I agreed to play my cleric instead of my ranger).<P>With respect to what can guilds do to retain clerics, some good advice has already been given.

It's not a very exciting class to play and comes with few rewards unless you plain just like helping people, as I do.<P>I've been offended on more than one occasion by self serving people asking for a rez only to find out it didn't give back the exp they wanted.

</FONT><HR>How about this for a reason to leave:<P>On any and every raid, the one cleric higher in levels than yourself (and the only one with Nalton's Mark) doesn't use /tgb to help get everyone buffed.  That cleric buffs his/her group with a single peridot and sits down on their ass, while myself (and any other clerics) blow 5-6 peridots to buff groups, and buff the few people who don't have a cleric in the group.  Now imagine this happening on every raid you do...even after you tell the guild "Why don't we use /tgb to save on peridots?" before the raid even starts.  Taking it one step further, imagine not being reimbursed for any of the peridots you use, or even given any of the vendor loots (berserker's sword, etc).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I just left EQ about a week ago, but i still haunt the boards. I was hoping to wait till at least the clerics changes showed up to see what would happen, but thats not gonna happen. <P>My whole reason(s) for leaving are my absolute hatred for the system, and verrant interactive. I have never played a worse video game in my life, well ok maybe G.R.O.W.L. for the sega genesis, but that's beside the point. <P>The game is based on spending time doing things that aren't even fun. It's kinda like those parts in the final fantasy games where you have to go around and find random encounters with monsters so you can level up and thats not fun. It's monotonous and it gets boring, but unlike final fantasy, there are no cool cutscenes you can watch, no cool storyline you can follow, just camping for exp, camping for loot, camping for money, camping for trade skill components.<P>I love the guild i was in, we still keep in touch and we're planning on getting together in some other games. But EQ sucks and i couldn't take it anymore.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I can imagine there's a lot of pressure on misc clerics playing lots. First of all there IS indeed active pressure from the very highest end guilds, who are always looking for more good clerics (atleast on Rodcet recruiting clerics has been used even as an offensive weapon...), hence the temptation to move on is very real for the clerics that enjoy raiding. We just offer more bang per hour played  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif">  (shameless add!)<P>Then of course there's those that get burned out due to extreme pressure. We have enough clerics that this isn't a huge issue anywhere except Emperor Ssraezhsa... which is worrying me, keeping doing it (we're a relatively small guild) WILL burn out clerics... mages even more so. Interesting dilemma in there, one of our clerics already taking a break because we need 80% clr attendance.<P>Dunno about clerics getting blamed. Everyone seems to get blame rather equally with us. Monks for bad pulls, shaman/enc for too slow debuffing, clerics for poor healing, melee for imperfect agro control, wizards for getting ****ty dps, mages for too few rods etc. Lots of blame to throw around, no need to hog for clr =p  <P>I guess unfair loot distribution can be a problem too, but I don't believe really in non-dkp systems. We abused a guild that did nazi looting. They kept equipping main tanks first, and we systematically recruited them once they got equipped... was really profitable for us, but sheesh, took them a healthy amount of time to move to dkp.<P>Sub 60 I really, really don't know.<P>-- Delheru Tanreall<BR><A HREF="http://www.ascentguild.com" TARGET=_blank>Ascent</A>, Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with everything listed above.  Bottom line, when you start to dread going to a guild raid, it is time to change your main or change your guild.  I decided on the former, though unfortunately leveling (my former main) up to 60 takes too long, so I still play my cleric on raids until I can get my enchanter up to par.  Biggest reason why I dread playing my cleric now is frustration.  I'm getting too bored at raids, and too disappointed with the amount of overall disrespect from people towards clerics.  <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24725" TARGET=_blank>Aiyre Soulfyre</A> <BR>High Priest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I just rejoined my guild after leaving it for about 4 days, both leaving and rejoining were some of the hardest descisions I've made in my time in EQ.<P>Why I left:<P><UL TYPE=SQUARE>All hands raids 5 - 6 times a week, meaning that I had to raid even on nights when I really didn't feel like it.<P>The fact that all hands, often means "all hands if you are a cleric" (double standard)<P>Being blamed for every death/raid failure/screw up.<P>Being absolutely needed for raids and not needed at all for exp groups.<P>Being pressured to rack up AA points when I cant stand to exp and thought I was done with that crap when I got 60.<P>LUCLIN<P>Ssra<P>General guild issues, not specific cleric ones.<P>Not being able to solo a light blue mob w/o using more than 80% of my mana while my ranger in 30% of the uberness of my clerics gear can plow through normal blues with barely any downtime.<P>Leaving on a vacation from EQ for 10 days, and watching my guild only raid on 3 of them, due to lack of clerics.<P>Seeing my guild lower their standards with regards to clerics for recruitment over and over, b/c of the lack of them.<P>Repeatedly seeing people in my guild say things like "all you need for the clerics is for them to be lvl 39 so they have CH"  I really cannot seem to get across to them how terribly insulting that is to my skill as a cleric.  There is a particular person in my guild who is guilty of doing this numerous times, I've had to put him on ignore several times b/c I got so upset over it.<P>Having to explain to the tank for the 90th time why he didn't get a heal when he died in less than 3 seconds/asked for a heal at 100hp.<P>Knowing that even though any other class in your guild can change mains, you can't b/c you are a cleric.<P>Dealing with being replaced by two boxxed twinks (most of whom are not even 60) that I have to work with and treat as equals</UL><P>Honestly, for a very very long time I loved my cleric.  And I love raiding, in the 4 days I was unguilded, I just about went stir crazy.  I got two tradeskills to 200 on my druid and made like more solstice robes than I care to think about.  But raiding too much, and dealing with too much stress and bitching and people being mean gets to me after a while.  I don't like my cleric anymore much, I'm tired of not being able to solo, tired of not being able to invis,tired of having to train the zone when I get one greenie mob on me b/c I can't solo it w/o the right spells up, if at all.<P>I went back for my friends, whether I'm going to be sticking with it, I don't know right now.  If I leave again, it's probably the end of EQ for me, outside of a high end raiding guild, this game holds little interest for me, but inside one, raiding more than 5 nights a week is leading me to burnout that I don't know how to escape anymore.<P>Ceridwen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Wow, this is seriously messed up.<P>I relate to all of it, and have been retired for the most part for a month or two.  I thought it was just raiding burning me out, and I enjoyed the rest of the game.. but the raiding is what kept me playing.<P>It isn't a good place to be in where the source of enjoyment is causing such grief.<P>I still don't know what could be changed to stop this all from happening.  The game is too set in its ways.  At least VI has seemed to grow some balls and is willing to make some sweeping changes without fear of destroying this mess they call balance.  Maybe there is hope for us.<P>I hope this balancing coming up restores some fun for our class<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Gosh, this is an interesting thread. One I've often thought on myself these past few months. For myself, the guild I was in took a major hit a year ago when there were only two clerics over 50th level. I was the highest one, yet still in my low 50's. So I was determined to level up, putting in many hours fighting to get in camps which often resulted in 'sorry you are not 56th level, we can not use you'.. That was the first hit is becoming disenchanted. The next came when another cleric joined the guild, of higher level than me. He became the choice cleric, as the saying might go. Our guild had maybe one 55+ xp'ing group and the other cleric seemed to get preference whether it was intentional or not. <P>Our guild then started raiding with other guilds, and the boring nights of sitting in a secondary or teritary(sp?) group meant all I did was the occassional buff since my group rarely took damage. It got to the point where I'd struggle to stay awake from the boredom. :P<P>And now? The guild is doing farely well. We've got 5(full time) clerics over 50th now, mine being the second highest. I've been wanting to complete my epic, but that doesn't look to be very realistic on Veeshan. Who knows. Right now I'd be estatic if I could get 3 more levels to hit 60th. Of course, then that means less time playing NWN..<P>Oh yes, another thing, my guild has gotten very raid heavy lately. At least 4 nights a week. Prime time. Makes doing the xp grind very difficult. *grumbles*<P>-Nimdale<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Flooglehammer, high end raiding with 30-40 people is boring and unprofitable for clerics.  We usually stand around 95% of the time; most of us don't even buff anymore once someone in the guild has mass group buff.  <P>Everyone else is dealing and taking damage (all evening long), and our biggest joy is finally pulling off a good complete heal rotation.  <yawn> <P>We aren't even able to watch the big fight because we have to face a wall and stare at the rotation messages.  Are clerics essential, yes, are raids exciting, no.  <P>And we clerics don't get to end our raid evenings with any interesting gear until the guild has reached the point when those plate armor pieces would otherwise rot.  <P>If your playing time is limited, your cleric character stagnates, because all your time is consumed by raiding.  Those relatively few clerics who can play endlessly are racking up those AA points, and the rest of the people in your guild are doing it too, but some clerics can't even find the time to scrape money together to buy a few spells.<P>I oversimplify, but hours and hours of standing around (yet still not daring to look away from the screen) is not fun, and pretty soon we clerics are distracted by other games, or other things to do in RL, that are a much more fun use of the evening.  <P>I had to leave a raiding guild to regain my interest in EQ after not logging in for a month.  I was tired of making no progress while watching others grow in power, in some small part due to my efforts.<P>To retain your clerics, make sure they are still progressing, either in loot, items, or experience, preferably in all three.  I suggest swamping your clerics with lots of cash, so they can purchase what they need if they aren't likely to have the time to hunt for it because of raiding, or sell that extra loot and buy stuff for the clerics.  Find out what spells they need, what faithstones they need, make sure they have the cash for things or make sure the guild buys it.<P>For clerics, raids can equal no character growth.  If it goes on long enough, clerics leave.  Make sure your clerics are progressing somehow if you want them to stay.  There has to be some reward for all those boring evenings watching other people have fun.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>After dying five times on one raid ( and we didn't even kill him, man how come sometimes a mob we killed in ten minutes last week makes us look like a bunch of noobs the next week ?) I went looking for xp. I found out I can solo a centi dator in akheva, takes all my mana but I can do it. But after watching the ranger next to me kill six in the time I killed one I gave it up and went to rez guildies. In spite of the fact they only had three people I still didnt get invited to join in the fun after rezzing them. Can't talk to my class elders, they all got sixty back when groups still wanted clerics.<P>So, I decided to do something drastic. I went to KC. Yes train central, noob training grounds. But much to my surprise I enjoyed myself there. They still want clerics in the groups there. No one is soloing half the zone.<BR>No one is upset that I can't aego them yet. In fact they love my buffs. Getting a 96% rez is still looked upon as a bonus there not a right. And its not like I can die there. With rs3 and da/db I'll always be able to hit the zone when four hands come trailing some noob.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Taken from Casters Realm:<P>The Cleric is one of the most fundamental classes in Everquest.  Looked at under the pain light of reality, Clerics keep people alive.  But there is a lot more to this class than just healing powers.<P>Clerics have the best health increasing buffs in the game.  With both their Symbol line of spells and their Courage line, they can at later levels give well over 1000 extra hit-points to people. Clerics also get an excellent line of AC increasing spells, and resistance buffs for all kinds of magical attacks.<P>Thats your job. You know when you start a cleric, you are there to heal and buff. Same way a warrior knows he is there to get beat down, same way a necro knows he is there for mana, same way blah blah blah <insert other class here>.....<P>Why do clerics quit their guilds? Same reason any other class quits their guild, they want to. End of story.<P>If you didnt want to heal people and give rez's, shouldnt have chosen a cleric. As for others who expect you to give out things for free, screw em. When you go on raids, /tell the raid leader your rules. I expect this back, or I expect this as payment for....etc.<P>I chose to be a Shadow knight. I tank. If I die, I die. We all die in EQ. Dont know if I know one person who has never died.<P>Quit your bitching or chose another character.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Lol Carp, when I started my cleric so did I read up on it on castersrealm. They said there was two types of clerics, Batttle cleric who was in the front line cursing the enemy and healing some and the healing cleric who stood behind and mostly healed. I choose dwarf because that was suppose to be the battle cleric. So no, I did not know that when I choose a cleric that I would end up 2.5 years later sitting looking at a wall at every raid.<P>As for changing class, lol, you got to be joking right? You are not allowed to change class as a cleric because they need your cleric, even if you level a char to 60 and get it 200 AA points they will still ask for your cleric on the raid. This thread shows some of the frustration that clerics have and if you cant see that then I suggest you play a cleric to 60 and join a raiding guild and play in it for the next year or two and try to get some AA etc.<P>Dangrim</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008817-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008817-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008817-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://www.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008817&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://www.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008817&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
