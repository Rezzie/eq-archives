As soon as i hit 6th level(I have a human cleric)i went to north ro through the tunnel and found a never ending supply of orcs and jackals and now that im level eight i still eliminate the local pumas and rattle snakes and i will find the infrequent orc riader that still cons blue. But is there a better area that i should go to? And what 1-handed blunt should i have. I think i have a copper mace. I want a fine steel morning star but 66 plat is the cheapest ive seen. I have also invested in armor. For level 8 is an AC of 230 good? If ya go to north ro look for a cleric named saleorn on the rathe server baby!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
