<br />
 Not a lot right now but there is a lot of people unhappy with some really dumb decisions on the part of Verant and the serious overcrowding issues on EVERY server. 1800+ people on a server? 1000 is what they were designed for and the game is just a shadow of what it was now.  <br />
<br />
People will also just leave to play something new. Lots of people have been playing EQ for 9 months straight. Some people will just play less EQ and play both games.  Rest assured that there will be players leaving and also players never coming, choosing to buy AC as thier first MMORPG. I myself am now mostly playing a necro on Tallon Zek as I cannot stand to play on the blue servers at any time but 2:00 AM to 1:00 PM PST.  Its just not worth fighting the kill stealers and hearing everyone bitch about this and that.<br />
<br />
 When you get frustrated in EQ or see someone acting like an ass... ask yourself a question. Would this problem exist if there were 1/2 as many people in this zone or on this server? Chances are the answer will be no. Someone ksing? Go somewhere else. Oh wait can't. EVERYWHERE is camped.  Someone being an ass? Petition him. Oh wait can't.  There are 2000 people on this server and it takes 4 hrs for a guide to get back to me.  Smarten up and add some servers Verant.<br />
<br />
  Actually maybe they wont have to. Between AC and the sheer cruelty Verant seems thrive on (Sure, I want to stare at a stump/riverbed/spot on floor for 8 hrs in a GAME. For a chunk of virtual armor. Sounds like a blast) the number people playing EQ will decrease.  It is already happening.  Look at the EQ boards.  What used to be filled with people discussing new things and strategies, with just a few whiners interspersed, is now ALL people complaining with basically zero discussion.  The posts have also changed from a couple people whining about obviously dumb things, to the trend now that is for longtime players to either post that they are quitting or demanding a change be made in a intelligent fashion. <br />
<br />
EQ is a great game but it is no longer the only game in town and I think the designers have really lost touch with who is playing this game.  WAKE UP VERANT!  The majority of your players are adults with MONEY to spend.  You have done everything change the focus of this game from the average player to a small group of teenagers or welfare recipients that can play this game 12 hours a day. If that is your target market you have got them all. Unfortunately it is the adult players who have the disposable income to buy your games. You are driving them out with your ridiculous ideas of how long quests take, how long levels should take, and how much exp you lose when you die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garrick Lifestream</div><div class="date">11-14-1999, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ive been playing EQ since it came out.. And as far as I am concerned if people want to move on and try another game.. let them.<br />
<br />
However, id have to hesitate to say that people are leaving EQ to go and play Asherons Call. Perhaps a few.. But I merely glanced at it.. Watched a few moments of gameplay, and from what I saw it was not what I'd call a &quot;fun&quot; game.. Not satisfactory in the least..<br />
<br />
The problem with most of these online RPG's is that instead of forming a cohesive community.. Where fairplay and fun are the focus of the GAME.. What people instead end up doing is turning this and other games like it into a glorified trip through a supermarket, if you will.. &quot;Gee, now alls I need is &amp;lt;insert item here&amp;gt;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally.. I do like the fact that other people play the game.. And I take the good with the bad. I realize that yes, there are going to be people out there who cant stand to share.. I simply stay out of their way. &quot;Why?&quot; you might ask.. Of course I have just as much right to be there as any of you etc.. But to me.. If a person is going to get all infatuated with silly virtual items, then just let them.. They are completely missing out on a major part of the game fun.. But its their 50$..<br />
<br />
I had met this dwarven cleric named foodawg.. And he had gotten the Ivory Bracer fever as it were.. By pure luck i managed to solo Hand, and went to show him my prize.. Instead of congratulating me on my acheivements.. He immeadiatly starts offering money.. I said no cause I had gotten it for my hard efforts.. Blah blah blah more whining.. I said just take the stupid bracer, its not that important to me.. He took it then gave it back and realized how stupid he had been acting over some little item in some glorified MUD..<br />
<br />
In the end the game is whatever you make of it.. Try not to let these people who prolly shouldve been kept back in kindergarten from ruining your fun..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erolotis</div><div class="date">11-14-1999, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let them leave. From what I have seen of AC its gonna be Bug City for months, and quite frankly, its a Microsoft product. Eq is the best. With the upcoming expansion (set for 3/00 so most likely 6/00) it will only be better. As for whiners, I have played for 4 months and most &quot;whiners&quot; I met when a newbie have now either left the game or grown up enough to cut that garbage off. When I meet ppl that KS or some other buffoonery, I avoid them, I have made enough good friends from around the world to not bother with ppl who don't meet my standards of play. As for too many ppl, let others try AC it will cut down on traffic and lessen the server load. Why would you want to leave a game thats been thru almost a year of trial(and it is trial still) for a new product that will face all the pitfalls that EQ has already overcome? Especially, after investing hours into your cleric, warrior, ect. AC has what 3 races? a system of spell casting and a &quot;fealty&quot; system that screams &quot;Here comes the BUGS!!&quot; It all sounds good on paper, but, rest assured its another game that hasn't been fully tweeked hitting the market ahead of schedule much to the headaches of those that run out to buy it. But, feel free to go, I am sure Verant isn't going to role over for the competiton. Eq will only get better, while you are off staring at &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; or whatever their dics. message is. As for camping I always find a spot, or a group. The party dam. patch changed KSing, as a cleric I am well recieved where I go, I am happy as hell with this MUD and have yet to reach lvl 50. hehehe. Maybe then I will look back at this post and wonder tho'...<br />
Yours, E</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree with the ridiculous quest process, especially for clerics.  I would sooner be shot than sit staring at my computer waiting for an ingot to summon on a stump (doubly so for the cheap end product). Better yet, whoever thought of that one should be forced to do just that for a month straight, perhaps then they will understand how extremely stupid this quest actually is. I certainly do hope that Verant wakes up and changes the quests in a major way.<br />
As far as jerks, I have met quite a few.  I have also met many more people whom I am glad to know.  When you do encoutner a jerk, simply move away from them.  If you are grouped with them, leave.  It is really that simple.<br />
<br />
Yes, everything is camped.  BUT, what about the expansion pack?  What about the new zones?  Verant IS making an attempt to spread out the players, and it may or not be working.  Still, there is room for improvement.  Yes, please add some new servers.  This will certainly help the current server load, as well as spread out new players.<br />
<br />
As far as losing touch with the players, judging by the &quot;new&quot; quests they are not out of touch with the Rangers, Warriors, and several other classes.  They seem to be quite cozy in fact.  BUT, what about the poor Cleric, who keeps the others alive?  He gets Stumpwatch '99, and armor that has less AC and worse buffs than the other classes (+5 INT, what do we need that for?  +5 STA on Chestplate when Rangers get +3 STR, +3 WIS, +30 HP?).  Perhaps Verant needs to forget some classes and &quot;remember&quot; some others.<br />
<br />
By all means continue to rant.  It's the only way the game gets better (and you can be dam sure I will rant on).<br />
