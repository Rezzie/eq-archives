I love being a healer I have always been one in muds but it seems Verant has no clue about healers or just doesnt care =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesius</div><div class="date">07-31-2000, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps, but I think we as a class in general are not as outspoken about class-specific issues as others (rangers for example).  If we were ALOT more vocal, maybe Verant would start listening to us?<br />
<br />
I love being a healer also, as I believe the majority of us do.  On the whole, I feel that Verant has done an decent job of making our class enjoyable to play.  When I focus on specific aspects of the game, that's when I lose interest.  So I don't do that anymore; I just try to have fun, make new friends, interact, and if I get exp, great.  If i didn't do that, I would have quit 6 months ago.<br />
<br />
Btw, I agree with you on the pet.  Total waste of mana in my opinion, unless you're in that situation.<br />

<br />
I really don't think Clerics should get such a spell, but since we do, our voice has spoken.<br />
<br />
I just wonder if Verant actually thought we'd use this spell for the cost of mana is uses.  I'm hopeing that they just put the spell out as-is until they get the proper feedback whereas they can 'tune' the pet (less mana).<br />
<br />
I'm sure it'll be less mana when more clerics reach the required level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaharz</div><div class="date">08-07-2000, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pets a joke... I got a good a laugh when I finally saw the stats on it.  I would have been horribly dissapointed but I never got my hopes up cause I knew we would never get pets worth it.  The mana cost is a just a bit obscene.<br />
I think as a class we do need to speak out more on occasion.  I don't know how many times I've seen a patch message coming across &quot;There's something for everyone in this patch.&quot; but there is nothing for clerics unless we got it as a side effect from &quot;tuning&quot; done on another class.  Examples of this are shorter fear casting times (meant to mainly help necros and SKs) and the zero recast on buffs that said explicitly in the patch message was to aid shamans.<br />
There's some points where I wish they'd make an obvoius nerf, just so I knew they even payed any attention to clerics.  I realize groups look for clerics, and we are good for the groups so clerics are exactly what Verrant wants.  I don't care if I can't solo, that's why I made a mage to play on occasion... but some things are ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The two main gripes I have right now are the Lord Grimrot spawn.  I realize it is a really good item that should take a lot of work.. but that camp is just ridiculous.  I'm sure I'm preaching to the converted here though.<br />
<br />
My other gripe is primary hand items.  How many things are really worth putting in there?  I'm 35th and still have a sacrament, although I just got a mithril frog totem to use on occasion.  On the rare occasions I can actually swing away in a fight without risking running low on mana, I almost never hit, it's somewhat pointless. What is there that is actually useful in our primary hand, mithril frog totem, plat dragon totem, paw of appollo, sharkbone warhammer, the 1hand blunt from kith (I forget exactly what it is called), the springwood club, and two god drops.  I'm sure there's other stuff out there that I don't know of or remember right now.. but it's probably a short list.  I mean I don't want a nasty weapon.. cause my skill is to awful even with it being almost maxed to hit anything.. but doesn't seem wrong that monks get a 1hand blunt that procs Smite?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">preiter</div><div class="date">08-09-2000, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do people feel that they should have upgrades in every patch? Patches are for bug fixes and game tuning, it's not a Christmas present or a new novelty for you to play with.<br />
<br />
When we don't get a change in a patch, that means that Verant thinks the class is Ok. And I am inclined to agree with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">A11e</div><div class="date">08-17-2000, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Preiter, but I disagree with you.  Human and Erudite Clerics are night blind yet clerics are the only pure casting class that doesn't get night vision spells (even hybrids get night vision spells).  <br />
<br />
Verant gave Superior Heal to several classes and Rez to Pallys.  Clerics received no new abilites.  <br />
<br />
<br />
My biggest gripe about clerics is that we can be unbelievably boring.  Unless we are fortunate enough to have clarity and/or mana song (or are in an extremely slow pulling group), we rarely have enough mana to do more than just heal, med and throw in an occasional buff.  On those rare occasions when we can spare the mana, we get to play yoyo - stand, stun, sit, rinse and repeat chain stunning the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">08-17-2000, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A11e - why are you complaing about other classes getting superior heal? its not that great a spell anyhow.  Once ya get to 51 it becomes pretty worthless, when ya get to 53 it becomes even more so.<br />
<br />
Other classes getting ressurection is good, if ya getting a group cos of ressurection i feel sorry for you.<br />
<br />
playing a cleric is all about strategy and how to handle mana when you don't have much.  How many other classes in the game get spells that actually require skill to use? and the more skillful you are the better they are.<br />
<br />
Any class can be unbelieveably boring after long enough playing them in the same place with the same people killing the same things.<br />
<br />
I have said before, class has absolutely nothing to do with how interesting a time you have, what you do and who you do it with will.<br />
<br />
Regarding the pet.  Think of it as a high mana cost DOT that can get resisted (ie killed).  Learn to use it for situations it was designed for.  Having the pet is a bonus (maybe not a significant one but one nonetheless) accept it use it or don't use its up to you.  It's certainly not a no brainer oh look I just got heroism I wonder what ill buff from now on type spell.</div></div><hr />
