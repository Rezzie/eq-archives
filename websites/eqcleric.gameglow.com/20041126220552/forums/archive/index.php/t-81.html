How do you do it?  I hit 51, spent 8 hours and gained maybe a pixel or 2.  I got so frustrated, I almost quit.  Then I started a super twink, an iksar monk.  He's alot more fun than I think I ever had with my cleric, and one heck of a damage dealer.  <br />
<br />
I guess my question is, how do you muster the time and patience it takes to hit anything over 51, only to lose what seems like all of it in one death?   Maybe it's just me and the burn out factor, but all I ever use my cleric for now is to res fellow guild members.<br />

That's really the only advice I can give you.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of new zones, new dungeons- get together with your guild or a group of friends and explore them.  See how far down you can go in Sebilis...see how well you can control the spawns in Chardok.  Heck, go back to older zones now that they're emptied out and play around in there.  Test your skills that you've gained over the time you've played your cleric.<br />
<br />
You may die a lot.<br />
<br />
But the experience will come.  Just don't focus on it.<br />
<br />
I've been having more fun lately in Everquest than I have in a long, long time.  And I think a big part of that is that I've not been focusing on leveling- I've been focusing on honing my skills (as cheesy as that sounds), exploring with friends, and just well...having fun.  Don't quit your cleric!  Just rearrange your priorities. =)<br />

ps- keep that twink...if you have a bad night, play it!  That's what I do...warrior twinks are great for stress relief. =)</div></div><hr />
