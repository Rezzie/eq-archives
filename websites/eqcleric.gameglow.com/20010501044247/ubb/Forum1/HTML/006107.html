</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>I am still not convinced that we are playing the game the way Verant designed it to be played. If true, should we call a hammer flawed because we cannot use it to eat  as if it were a spoon? Should we blame the maker of the hammer?<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>We are NOT playing the game the way Verrant intended. The best example is Lower Guk. Verrant once stated that Lower Guk was intended to be played as a group starts at the beginning and fights their way through to the King, and exits out the back zone. 15-20 minutes after the first group starts their run, another group can start. <P>They did not intend for people to slice and dice up the zone into "rooms" and "camp spots" and stay there for hours and hours essentially farming the same items over and over.<P>Of course, design and reality are usually miles apart. People find the best, safest way to get what they want out of the game. Namely experience and items. And Verrant's idea of Lower Guk, while IMHO would be a hell of alot of fun, is not very efficeint for long term EXP or Item gain. Too many deaths, too many issues. People discovered that staying in one spot waiting for that Lord to spawn with that awsome SSOY was alot better than killing the Place Holder and moving on.<P>Having realized this, Verrant has made slight changes in the way spawns are handled in the newer zones. Like Chardock. Any MOB can drop just about any item in the zone. Or some places where no matter how hard you try to split up the spawns, certain rooms always spawn all at once. This adds variety and uncertainty to the zone, making it more fun.<P>Or course, players realize that this is not condusive to gaining UBER LEWT and mad xp's, so these zones are, for the most part, unused. BYOG (Bring Your Own Group) zones. Human nature is to do what is most profitable  with the least amount of effort. And this is where games fail.<P>The problem is, there is no spoon, and it is not possible to design a game that would work around human nature. Because no matter how you code it, someone will figure out a better way to get what they want faster and more efficient than you can code ways to stop them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The players of EQ are on it like a full time job and Vi still thinks they are going to beat them. When verrant finally takes the mentality of "if ya can't beat them join them" then i think some real progress might actually be made. For gods sake these people spend every waking hour on the game, of COURSE they are gonna know the shortcuts, of course they will know how to do things better but Vi punishes everyone for what these few do.<P>What they need to do is seperate the uber players from the normal players. have zones that are specifically designed for them. Maybe a zone that has incredible loot, like donals BP's pre nerf and MoK pre nerf BUT if they die the monsters will loot their bodies. They stand a chance to make huge gains but stand to loose alot if they fail. I think the uber players need challenges to match their playing style, not nerfs to cramp their style.<P>Nerfs only slow them down for a time until they find a way around that, it's the casual gamers they are hurting most. VI will never beat the uber gamer, so they might as well join them and make it fun for everyone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Because no matter how you code it, someone will figure out a better way to get what they want faster and more efficient than you can code ways to stop them."<P>Not quite.  Verant's Vision is part of it [the spoon's intended use].  I do agree that, at its best, it would be extremely difficult for anyone to design a game that 'would work around human nature.'  But, the purpose of the spoon still exists.  It is the way Verant thinks we ought to play their game.  No one can refute that.  The fact it, the spoon is used not just for eating (it's intended purpose) but say, as a weapon, or a paperweight.  <P>So does Verant know best?  Do they truly _know_ how we ought to play their game?  Reading several of Abashi's and Absor's posts, both explicitly tell us that they _think_ their way is the best (in terms of enjoyment).

</FONT><HR>What VI really needs to do is wipe every old dungeon off the map and replace them with ones that actually make sense.<P>There are three reason that people will never play the game the way VI wants them to:<P>1) It is virtually impossible to consistently get a group of people from unrelated spots in Norrath, get them over to a dungeon you want to "do," get them organized, and then have all of 30 minutes of fun fighting your way through it, getting maybe one interesting drop and less experience than any of the players would have gotten soloing low blues.<P>2) There is no alternative place or mechanism to get 99% of the items in the game. If you want an SMR, there is one and exactly one place to get one. So why would you go anywhere else? You can get roughly equivalent items in some cases, but every single enchanter who wants to complete their epic is essentially obligated to sit in lower guk for weeks camping the Magus. Why the hell would that enchanter organize 12 different groups over 6 hours a day to "do" the dungeon instead of just sitting there and reading a book between spawns (or in many cases, asking the guild necros who now have nothing to do in Velious raids to go solo the spawn for a day).<P>3) If you try to do a dungeon, you will die. A lot. You will spend 15 minutes working your way down, someone will die, and then you will spend 6 hours doing CRs and refighting through rooms. Meanwhile the next group waiting at the platform to ride the Lower Guk ride is tapping their feet. yeah, right. They got tired and just fought their way past you, and are now begining the same multihour CR process in the next room because the mage's body fell through a wall.<P><BR>I honestly can not believe that VI ever thought anyone would play this game "as they intended." Maybe up until level 20, when there are no dungeons with anything worth camping and most of the mobs still wander around.<P>All randomized loot did was move the lowest level camp site to the zone out area. Dungeons without the initial population to support the playstyle the game forces you into (anything old world except Lower Guk and SolB, most Kunark dungeons except for Sebilis, the non-city zones in velious) are all empty 90% of time and thus raid-oriented.<P>All I can say to VI is "Well, duh."<P>I can zone into Droga on any day of the week, any time, and I will tell you exactly how many people will be there. Three. Me, the guy farming the Idol of the Thorned, and the guy farming the Shroud of Nature.<P>I can zone into Solusek's Eye on any day of the week, any time, and I will tell you exactly how many people will be there. Ten. Me, the guy farming the Molten Cloak, a paladin trying to get Melatite, someone fighting the Solusek Priest or whatever his name is that drops an epic component, some farming imp skin gloves, and one level 25 player asking "Any exp groups here?" There will be four other people who are there after surviving a train in solb and zoning in for safety. They'll be gone in ten minutes.<P><BR>I've posted this elsewhere, but I'll say it again because I am in absolute shock that VI keeps avoiding this:<P> Dungeons in EQ are broken as designed. <BR> Camping items is NOT fun.<BR> <P>What I do not understand is why dungeons, and lets use lower guk as an example, don't work like this:<P>You zone into Upper Guk, the thriving city of Frogloks. The greeter says "Hello %T, Welcome to Guk. The inn and markets are yonder, and then temple to (whatever paladin god the frogs worship. Has anyone ever found out who?) is down that way."<P>In the temple of $GOD, the Shin Lord says "Hello %T, I understand you are here because you want [a Ghoulbane|an SMR|money|$phatlewt] -- if you bring me some of the following items I will have the smiths and tailors of my people make you such in reward."<P>Having received this quest, you go down into the ruins of old guk to slay the horrid undead frogs. They drop numerous items which you take N number of back to the Shin Lord to prove your worth, he gives you $item.<P>No camping, no sitting in one place all the time. You can fight your way down to the Ghoul Lord, kill him, take his head back to the smiths of Guk and get your Yak.<P><BR>Drop rate controls are stupid. They don't work over time, and they annoy the hell out of players.<P><BR>Alternatively, if you are evil, you can wander down slaughtering the goody goody frogs of Guk, fight your way down to the Froglok King, take his crown and the Mithril Two Hander Plans from his smiths, and walk back to Neriak where you buy a large piece of mithril, find a player with high blacksmithing skill, give him the plans and the mithril, and he makes you a Mithril Twohander.<P>Want an FBSS? Bring me two scrolls of Swift like the Wind, five pieces of silk, two vial of mana that I can imbue with the spells, six small gems of certain types that I can use to hold the magic in the item, and two shadow wolf pelts -- wala, FBSS.<P>Sure, it took you 36 hours to find all that stuff, but you weren't sitting on your ass camping the Frenzied Ghoul the whole time, and any number of players can do this quest concurrently.<P><BR>If players new that every time they "did" lower guk at least one person would get all the commonly dropped quest items they needed for something they wanted, then you actually would see six people getting together and "doing" the dungeon. There would be no point in sitting in the Frenzy room all week, because only one of the quest items for the sash dropped there, and it dropped all the time.<P>Any time the loot is static and sufficient enough to form a constant playerbase, you are never going to find anyone doing a dungeon unless the zone is just too difficult to survive in, in which case they're just going to raid it because a six person group would never survive anyway.<P>I suspect nothing I'm writing is sounding at all new to players, because we all figured this out days into the game.<P>So no, we are not playing the game the way VI intended, primarily because their "intended" playstyle is about the stupidest possible way to play their game.<P>Sorry for the ranting, but this has always been a sore issue for me. My intial playgroup in EQ basically fell apart because our Paladin wanted a Ghoulbane and we decided to "do" Upper Guk. A week later and a level lower, we all gave guk the finger and it's been next to impossible to get that group together to do anything ever since.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think one thing that would help a lot is for Verant to reopen the firepot room for binding and add a cheap (20-30pp) Translocate: Timourous Deep potion so melee classes could use it. In the current game climate of distributing class abilities among other classes, giving people the ability to self-port to almost any city is not unbalancing and would be a huge improvement in gameplay experience for everyone. Wizards and druids would still be the only ones who could evac and group teleport and would still have access to teleport destinations noone else had. Getting your group together would be almost instantaneous, then you could run or port together to the destination of your choice. Yes, the world would become a little smaller, so maybe they could add a quest to be able to use the firepot room that required you to travel to each city and collect a talisman, then turn them all in to a NPC in the firepot room who would give you a single firepot key.<P>Just my two cents. I think that would revolutionize the game, honestly, and without unbalancing PvE in the slightest.<P>WW</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Pretty good ideas, Isafel but there's one major thing you forget...<P>Experience.<P>When I zone into OS and /shout for a group I'm not looking for loot, I'm looking for exp. Why do you think people camp the pool room of SolB, where no loot drops? It's fast exp. TONS of blue mobs that can be gotten there easily in controlled pulls.<P>Verant's exp system is horribly out of whack. It takes you as long to go through the final 10 levels as it did to go through the first 50. Now, it's easy to say "It's because Verant wants you to play the game longer" which may or may not be true. But the simple fact is that 51-60 was added as an "overflow valve".<P>It's pretty obvious Verant never planned for ANY expansions in the original stages. Some of the things they did were so short sighted it was pathetic. <P>There were only 3 places to go for post-40 exp: SolB, LGuk and Kedge. Kedge was nice, but you HAD to have an EBer and worse, the ideal spell for the zone, DMF, couldn't be cast in there (FYI, it still can't, as per The Vision<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP>) So, for practical reasons everyone crammed into SolB and LGuk. They were the only places to get a pickup group. Kunark helped solve that (be careful what you wish for... zones filled with level 40 yard trash is a BAD thing). Despite the new zones, the best places to get exp are still those few places where you can pull a steady stream of blues and those happen to be Sebilis and Karnor's. Everywhere else you can do this is either too far out of the way (Splitpaw, CoM) or too hard to reach (Velketor's Labyrinth, Dragon Necropolis) or has a hard to get key (Howling Stones).<P>Skills use only one byte. One byte is 8 bits and a bit is a 0 or a 1. If we let the resulting string represent base 2, we can represent all the numbers from 0 (00000000) to 255 (11111111). That's why none of your stats (except HP, mana and AC) can exceed 255 and none of your skills can exceed 252. This model worked just fine in the pre-50 world but in the post-50 it fell apart. Meditate caps at 252 (level 51) so casters without mana regen (read: clerics) suffer as their mana pools go up but their ability to regain that mana stays the same. Monks were better at melee but now they are equal to warriors and must use weapons to outdamage them. The list goes on... The point is they should have gone to a 2 byte stat on everything when Kunark opened but now it's too late. Switching would require a MASSIVE revamp of the entire game structure, something Verant won't do given how much work they've put into other, more minor problems in the past.<P>Flow control via spawn rate. Better known as the "rare spawn" or "the PH cycle". For certain things, this works quite well. The AC in OOT is a good example of PHed mobs not grinding people into the ground with boredom. But for the rest it's just plain awful. I think we all know the reason why...<P>So no, EQ isn't perfect. I'm not sure it'll be fixed. And a new GUI in SoL isn't gonna fix it...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>Erudite Templar of Prexus<BR>Cohort Chalybeius<BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

In the time it takes my finger to begin to raise from the key I just hit, that calculation could have been done hundreds of time.<P>VI did some tests and found that their skill system scaled acceptably between totally arbitrary point 1 and point 50, and so it didn't matter.

With drop rate controls, you just frustrate players who know that if they waste enough time, they will get what they want.<P>Eventually every tank will have Lamentations. Back before Kunark every tank had Ykeshas. They went and got them because there is no comparable item -- you can't win a fight with just a regular sword in EQ, you have to have the best sword conceivably available to someone 10 levels higher than you in order to do well against NPCs of your level. So everyone needs the best, and the best is a single item.<P>You can go on for days about how back in the day people ran around in leather with fine steel and were happy, but I've fought with leather and fine steel and getting your ass handed to you by a greenie is no way to spend an afternoon.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">
