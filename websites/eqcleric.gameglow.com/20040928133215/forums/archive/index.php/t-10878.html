Others claim you can't get him with 60 level 55+ people.  Can't land slow but rogue poison works.<br />
<br />
What is the truth here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaldiana D'Ozz</div><div class="date">07-24-2001, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, he is unslowable by traditional means (honestly I don't know about rogue poison, we havent messed with it for the most part).  <br />
Yes, even unslowed he is doable with low numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically it depends on a few things (just like all BGH mobs do):<br />
<br />
First and foremost...How well does your group work together?  If your clerics don't time heals right with each other, your tanks don't know how to gain/regain aggro or take over main tanking etc, then even with 60 people you'll have trouble.  <br />
<br />
Practice makes perfect on anything, raiding as a cohesive group takes a ton.<br />
<br />
How prepared are you for that particular mobs abilities?  Does it AE?  Is it resistable and if so which resist?  Can it be slowed?  Does it dispell?  What debuffs are worth using?  Should melee be defensive or offensive?  Which nukes will land?  Are single target heals or group heals more efficient? Etc.  In this particular case, it's learning to deal with his AE snare.<br />
<br />
<br />
When in doubt and learning...zerg (but not to the point the resulting lag makes it even worse...ugh).  <br />
Once you've gotten some experience, cut the numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps...not giving specific strategies since you didn't ask for them necessarily and since some don't like spoilers *nod*  <br />
