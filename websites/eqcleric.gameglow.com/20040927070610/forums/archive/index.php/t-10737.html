Most stuff here gives exp up till 50th.  The 2 at the entrance were nerfed and don't drop anything anymore, and they have 10x more hps and are 10x harder but are also 20 levels lower...anti zone out camping I guess.  The ones just past those are the ones to kill.  I got 39-42 in Skyshrine and may go back for more soon.<br />

I've killed in skyshrine for over two weeks and have always had a warrior or mage and earth pet handy.  C-Heal on a pet is better than healing a warrior ;-)</div></div><hr />

About 1/3 of the time I had a good group, the other 2/3 of the time I had a 55 Warrior and we had no need for an ench because he would just tank 2-3 monsters at a time.  Got me a full set of guardian, him a few spare pieces and also got him the very nice for tanks mantle/gorget.<br />
<br />
Went back there last week with a paladin, me, mage, necro, and bard.  Didn't see any robes drop for the casters but we got a couple pieces of guardian for the bard and some sentry armor for a ranger that showed up for a little bit.  Think he got about 1 piece per death... he seemed to like dying more than just sitting in the corner and waiting for his armor to drop...<br />
