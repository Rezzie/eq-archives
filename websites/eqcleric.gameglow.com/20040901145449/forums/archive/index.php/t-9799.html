My faction is maxed. I can not get any faction for doing any of the quests for the pallie guild or cleric guild or recieve any faction for killing any mobs that used to give faction. <br />
<br />
I have petitioned several times about this and have been told a few different stories. <br />
From a guide named Tarius basicly after I did the quest that the quest is bugged and then I should talk to koggog(lead-gm admin) to get my heart and scyte back since my faction is maxed and i should have obtained the shield. Tarius was very help full and even informed me after that he heard that a fix for the quest is going in on the next patch. (when ever that is)<br />
<br />
I have talked to koggog several times now and had other guides talk to him and all he tells me and the guides is basicly that the quest is not broke and that I failed in completing it due to the fact that my faction was not high enough. And that basicly i'm screwed in that I have to camp Lord Grimrott over and then raise my faction. Huh raise my faction but I just told you I don't get any faction hits for any quests or mobs that used to give me faction.<br />
<br />
I was told by 2 guides to email questhelp@variant.com and have but as of yet no reponce back from them.<br />
<br />
I am very fustrated with this quest and the fact that the GM's are doing nothing to help out even though there is obviously a bug that is preventing me from obtaining the shield.<br />
