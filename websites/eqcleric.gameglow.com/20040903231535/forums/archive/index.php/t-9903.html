<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Machia Velli</div><div class="date">11-10-2000, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it when other peoples servers go down other people go to other servers, start up newbie characters, and commence begging?  Yesterday, several servers were down, and one person decided to come up to me for buffs as I was in GFay.  I responded with &quot;Please don't beg from me, its unhealthy, there's a full forest of things to kill, along with other clerics out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn't like that, and started to curse me out, and commenced to trying to lag me off by doing /consent machia over and over again.  I guess since that didn't work he decided to /rude me over and over (hotkey I think?) and managed to lag 2 people out by the bank but not myself.  He did accept a duel, where he ran by the guard, who did not mind me striking him down.<br />
<br />
Later, he tells me he has a level 60 cleric on Tunare, by the name of Darian Mo'adib, a dark elf.  He quizzes me on the cast time of word of redemption, which sounds like an interesting spell to ask about since anyone could know that.  So I asked him how much, with full EM and full charisma gear on, a  peridot would cost.  Now, I think ALLLLL us elves and dwarves have been getting ripped off, because apparently in Neriak they cost 8pp!  Simply astounding since every enchanter I asked said 10.5pp is the lowest you can go.<br />
<br />
Be on the lookout for Mista Kewl Do0d Darian Mo'adib, supposed level 60 dark elf cleric, on the Tunare server.  And, if you see him and his kewl self, let him know that Machia says hi.<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Back to camping GImblox on SolA for me I suppose.<br />
