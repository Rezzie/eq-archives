<br />
EM - got what I want some time ago.<br />
Innys drop - got Lodizals Shell Shield so I wouldnt use.<br />
5svAll earring - ok, I only have 1 BD + the 10mr earring so I guess I could use this, barely.<br />
<br />
Please tell me I am missing a piece thats worthwhile from Hate so I can better stand the mob spam.... <br />

We killed Inny last week  and dropped no human stuff.  I later see what the human piece is and BLEH!  Its a questionable upgrade from a NoS.  I'll pass on it.  So I scratch Hate off my list of places to return to.  I'd love to get back to Fear though =).  Its good to see some more cleric gear in Fear.  I wish they would revamp and give all new items in sky.  80% of the gear there is substandard for the level and skill needed.<br />
