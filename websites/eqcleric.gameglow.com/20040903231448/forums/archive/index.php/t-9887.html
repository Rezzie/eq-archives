<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Greetings!<br />
<br />
   I am Aenae Webspinner, a 50th level Priestess of Innoruuk on the Luclin server, and I want to share a little information with you about experience ressurections.<br />
<br />
1. The key to getting my attention is politeness.  Be polite, ask nicely, and if I have time I'll help you out.<br />
<br />
2. Good grammar helps considerably.  Saying &quot;can i get a rez plz d00d&quot; is not going to get you very far, especially since I am not a &quot;d00d&quot;.  A better example might be &quot;Greetings M'lady!  My immortal spirit hast become sundered from my mortal form.  When you have time and spare mana could I trouble thee for a ressurection?  My friend will drag the corpse to thee.&quot;  Note the roleplaying aspect.  Also note &quot;when you have time&quot; and &quot;will drag to you&quot;.  Make it as easy as possible and it will happen more often.<br />
<br />
3. Offering money is a joke unless it is a substantial quantity of money.  I am going to either help you or I won't, offering me 50 pp is not going to impact my decision.  If you choose to give me a gift afterwards I will cheerfully accept it, but 50 pp is not going to get my attention.  On the other hand I received an offer of 1000 pp for a ressurection in MM Castle the other day.  I was sitting around preparing to start up on a FG raid, but we were still waiting for some people so I said &quot;Okies&quot;.  The deceased provided transport from Lavastorm, had the body handy at the zone, and had the 1K on her as she went to the bank while I was in transit to the corpse.  These are all good things - learn them well.  Note I never asked her for money, it was offered.  Also note that I would NOT have gone if she had asked about 15 minutes later, no matter how much money she had.  If I am in a group they depend on me for heals - when I leave they are all stuck until I get back and I just will NOT do that to people.<br />
<br />
4. The vast majority of people who ask me for a ressurection are soloing Necromancers, Mages, and Druids.  My sympathy for these people is pretty limited.  If you want to farm the Frenzy, selling FBSS' for 9K each thats your business.  But when you die don't expect me to drop everything and come restore your lost experience for 42 pp and a pair of moonstone rings.<br />
<br />
5.  Being anonymous will usually irritate me immensely.  The FIRST thing I do after I get a request is a &quot;/who all player&quot; to check your location and level.  If you are anonymous &quot;So people quit begging me for SoW, ports, clarity, etc&quot; then you need to think about what you are asking from ME for a little bit and consider your own priorities.<br />
<br />
6.  Remember this one well - &quot;No&quot; means &quot;NO!&quot;.  If I can't do it (too busy, grouped, etc) then badgering me isn't going to help your cause any.  Being rude after the fact doesn't help either.  Example - I had left Guk and was headed to the Oasis to catch the boat to Timorous and hunt Faydedar before he despawns.  A person who had been farming Ass Sup sends me a tell asking for a ressurection.  Note that these are not exact quotes and have been modified to protect the innocent.  He said &quot;I went LD and died, and I'm bound in Trakanon&quot;, I say &quot;I feel for you, but I'm sorry I can't help you now I'm too busy.&quot;  He then said &quot;Plz plz plz!&quot;  Me - &quot;Sorry. no.&quot;  Him - &quot;Well thanks for nothing!  Now I have to hike to FV, catch a boat, hike to guk, and by the time I get there my corpse will be too old.&quot;  My response &quot;I'm sorry but I can't help you right now.&quot;  Harassing me afterwards only hurts you in the long run, for the NEXT time you need a ressurection.<br />
<br />
7.  Experience ressurections are not an entitlement.  If you want to be sure you are going to get one, be grouped with a good cleric.  We want to gain experience too.<br />
<br />
8.  Ressurection costs me 900-1100 mana for the spell and the follow up heal.  It takes a while for this to med back up, if you can supplement this somehow (Mod Rods + healing, Necro Refill, Clarity) then that helps your cause significantly.<br />
<br />
In closing a comment - when I was in Guk that day I did 8 charity ressurections in a two hour period.  Six of them were dragged to me, one was on my way in and one was on my way out.  They asked, and I helped.  I have never turned on Anonymous or Roleplay, with the exception of a one week period when this creepy guy was stalking me (yes, he was wierd).  <br />
<br />
I am always available to help, and happy to do so.  Feel free to ask, feel free to donate (whatever you feel your EXP is worth to you), and remember to hug the friendly priestess!<br />

<br />
When I commented on the 50 pp, what I meant is trying to bribe me to do a resurrection isn't going to get you very far unless its a BIG bribe.  The point is that whether I am going to resurrect you or not is not going to be swayed by an offer of 50 pp.  If you want to give me money afterwards, then feel free.  If you don't, that doesn't matter either - just give me a hug and a thank you, and try to pass on my assistance to the next needy soul.  Trust me, raising your bid to 75 after I say &quot;No&quot; the first time isn't going to make a difference.<br />

To see what kind of response I would get I tossed this up on the main Everquest boards &quot;http://boards.station.sony.com/everquest/Forum2/HTML/009976.html&quot; and got a post by Abashi.<br />

Aenae_Luclin,<br />
As someone who's seen /petitions that read, &quot;Soandso won't give me a rez&quot;, I thank you for helping the community out.<br />
<br />
Please allow me to add my own tip:<br />
<br />
9. Forcing the cleric in your group to /random for cleric spells or cleric loot that is dropped could hurt your chances of getting a rez in the future.<br />
