<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenian - Bristlebane</div><div class="date">12-06-1999, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes that's right I actually have 2 of these rare bracers.  No I didn't set out to farm Zahal and Regis, but I happened to kill him twice and bought the enchanted plat to finish off this quest.  I was actually hoping to get some Experience for turning in the items but no luck there. And please before flaming me for doing your quests, talk to Moraine.  I did the Cleric breastplate quest for her, basicly free of charge after I killed Bilge.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I'm taking offers for good ranger items in trade.  If nothing leaps out at me I'll probably just give them some of my cleric friends for the price of the enchanted platinum</div></div><hr />
