<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wicked</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally hit 44 yesterday and did some testing with my friend who's a 50 druid.  More specifically I'm talking about a Druids Skin like nature vs a Clerics Resolution buff and HP/AC buffs in general.<br />
<br />
Well my friend is a level 50 druid and has told me, along with many other people that clerics are the best at buffing and healing...I've heard this since day 1.  Hell they've even told me a while ago that our Resolution Buff outdoes any HP/AC buff in the game (well this was quite some time ago when they said that --maybe things have changed).  Well I received my new level 44 spells yesterday and experimented a bit with the new buffs. <br />
<br />
The Druid Skin like nature spell adds more HP/AC than the Cleric Resolution HP/AC buff.  I even spoke to a guide if there were bonuses based on the level of the caster for Resolution and they said no.  (Too bad I couldn't find a 50 cleric to cast reso on me to test it out).  Maybe there's something I'm missing....So it brings me to the following:<br />
<br />
Now the break down...<br />
<br />
Mana Costs:<br />
Skin like Nature (Level 49 druid): 300 mana<br />
Resolution (Level 44 Cleric): 110 mana<br />
<br />
Are we the best at HP/AC buffing ?  Our single HP/AC buff falls short of being the best, but it is more mana effiecient.  Does this make our buff the best?  To consider ourselves the best at buffing as some people proclaim, we have to add in the following factors/spells.<br />
<br />
On top of resolution, at minimum:<br />
<br />
Symbol of Pinzarn (Level 39):  Costs 200 mana, casting it takes a jasper costing about 8gp and change.  A pure HP buff.<br />
<br />
Symbol of Naltron (Level 44):  315 mana, costs 11pp and change per cast a pure HP buff that gives more HPs than Pinzarn.<br />
<br />
Armor of Faith (Level 39):  Pure AC buff, 150 mana.<br />
<br />
Shield of Words (Level 49):  Pure AC buff, 300 mana.<br />
<br />
To actually have the best &quot;final HP/AC buff&quot; at one given time, we have to stack our main HP/AC buff with additional HP and AC buffs.  We need to add a symbol buff and armor buff.<br />
<br />
So lets consider this setup:<br />
We start with our basic HP/AC buff:<br />
<br />
Resolution:  110 mana, HP/AC Buff<br />
<br />
We add an AC buff:<br />
Armor of Faith:  150 mana, AC buff, OR Shield of Words:  300 mana, AC buff.<br />
<br />
We add an HP buff:<br />
Symbol of Pinzarn:  200 mana, HP buff costs 8gp and change<br />
OR Symbol of Naltron 315 mana, HP buff costs 11pp and change.<br />
<br />
Basically these 3 buffs can range from 460 mana to 725 mana, and you are out the cost of either 8gp or 11 pp.<br />
<br />
So does this really back up the claim that clerics are the best HP/AC buffing class in the game?<br />
<br />
After hearing things from different people throughout my EQ lifespan and seeing things for myself, my personal view is that clerics have great HP/AC buffs but that doesn't make them the best buffers in the game.<br />
<br />
To truly be the best at the HP/AC buffing, we would have to use all 3 lines of our buffing spells and as you know, you basically have to pay through the nose to be the best at it (mana wise and PP wise --don't even start the debate that money means nothing ah higher levels, because for some of us it does).<br />
<br />
From a practical standpoint, who spends 500-700+ mana buffing someone up?  (Unless of course you are off to PoF).  Some of these buffs cost a ridiculous amount of mana, not to mention gem cost.  These buffs are a mana nightmare if you have a few tanks in your party.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that just because we have the best HP/AC buffs in the game when combined does not mean we are the best at, from a practicality standpoint.  If we were to be the best at HP/AC buffs, our spells would be efficient and feasible to use.  True, if we stack all 3 there is no match when it comes to HP/AC --we are the best in the sense that our spells can give the most HP/AC than any other class.  From a practical standpoint however, is this the best ?  My answer is no --the huge mana costs and pp cost for us to give the best HP/AC buffs is impractical and thats the reason why I believe we aren't the best at buffing.  If we were the best, I would expect a little more mana efficiency and maybe something better then gems for casting (maybe something like a quest item you need to have in order to cast things such as symbol, but not the repeated buying of gems.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is Verant needs to have a sit down and whats a clerics purpose other than res and heal? Is there any life other than this? Why is plate yeilding class have worse class specific plate than shaman/druid/rogues and rangers when they are chain/leather only? Things like that. We really have 4 spells that sets us apart. THe res spells that give xp back, and Superior and Total heal spells. Necros and Paly's get the undead spells, and our buffs are good if we want to spend the cash. Dont think any of the Great Shaman or Druid spells require components? Not the Buffs anyhows...my little vent ...<br />

I get just about the same AC from Bravery AND 116 hp for just 70 mana while I get about 13 or so AC for 75 mana for Spirit Armor.  Now what the hell is up with that?!?!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinur</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like heaven to me. At high levels a party wants a cleric for it's healing more than anything else (although they can do more). So it's not goig to hinder us getting a group.<br />
<br />
If a druid can take one of the 3 buffs we can cast of us then it means we as clerics have less down time. No complaints there at all  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
I think clerics are the only class to get more than one hp/ac buff. The basic resolution line.<br />
<br />
I see the offset of having additional STACKABLE hp and ac buffs is the casting time, mana and regent cost. The big differance is that we can stack similar effect spells, were as most other buffing classes only have one of that type spell.<br />
<br />
Basicly if you have a 49th level druid in your party, everyone in your party gets more hp/ac for less down time (downtime is shared with the druid). IF you dont you cast resalotion  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derenath</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, SLN is better, but not by a whole huge amount. Seems like reso gives me about 50 more hp than valor and SLN about 50 more than reso. 50 hp isn't worth it considering what else the druid can do with that 190 mana. Never done any timing either to see how long reso lasts compared to SLN, but reso lasts a long, long, time. Not sure how much more AC SLN gives, but I doubt it would make up for the mana cost.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather see my druid save that 900 mana for evacs, starfires, pack regens or chloro's than buffing the 3 tanks for an extra 50hp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thecklos</div><div class="date">10-31-1999, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, i've got a lower level cleric as well as a level 50 (oh no 49 after pof last night) enchanter.  <br />
<br />
From what i've seen is this (in terms of buffs that stack, don't stack.)<br />
<br />
Skin like nature is not just 50hp better but includes a minor addition to hp regeneration speed (and that regen extra stacks with chloroplast too.)  Makes SLN much better than resolutoin all considered (also removes that mana load from cleric.)<br />
<br />
Now as for the AC buffs, the cleric line of ac buffs guard, shield of words etc doesn't stack with the enchanter ac buffs (mist, cloud, shadow, etc)<br />
<br />
And the enchanter ones are incredibly more mana efficient, shield of words cost 300 mana the lvl 49 enchanter ac buff costs 70 mana for almost as much ac.<br />
<br />
So with a high level group you typically cast only Naltron (doing rough stuff) assuming you have an enchanter and a druid along anyway.<br />
<br />
Anyway that's been my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venia D`Veil</div><div class="date">11-19-1999, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If a cleric uses about the same amount of mana as a druid casting SLN, a cleric can get both resolution and Symbol of Pazarn (spelling wrong I know). Now with both of those buffs from the cleric, compare that to SLN. In an ideal case though, it is nice to have a druid cast SLN and then the cleric cast symbol, at level 38 I still can't get a full group with valor and symbol of pazarn, I can get 5 and have to med again. it is nice being able to share that responsibility. But usually I don't buff for the simple fact that hp buffs only help if the person has lost more then their normal amount of hps, if they don't get hurt that much there is no use buffing them. Better to use that mana keeping their hps high if most situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obarr</div><div class="date">11-19-1999, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys are missing the point regarding resolution vs SLN<br />
<br />
SLN is a level 49 spell, and resolution level 44, so SLN should be better than resolution as it is 5 levels higher.<br />
<br />
the difference isnt much though, especially compared to the difference in mana cost.<br />
<br />
at high levels, all the buffing you do is symbol &amp; shield yourself and tanks, resolution yourself and non tanks, druid picks up SLN on tanks. you save a bit of mana and they get that tiny bit more protection.<br />
<br />
sounds fine to me.  hell i wish we could dump more of our buffs on other, leaves me more mana for other stuff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alliliel</div><div class="date">11-19-1999, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might be missing the point on the buff thing. In my case, it's called guilt prevention. If one of my group members dies, I take it REAL personal. If I didnt have full buffs up on that person I feel even worse!<br />
<br />
Last night in the Ghost room in Unrest, we had to flee the zone because stuff was appearing, like out of nowhere. (We just cleared the pit and the pools and the ghost and suddenly 3 hags and 3 dark terrors come from nothingness, uh oh!)<br />
<br />
To break the room again, I put Guard, Bravery, Symbol of Ryltan, Endure magic/cold/fire on everyone. The enchanter gave us all clarity and a couple of other buffs. We each had over 12 buffs, easy. <br />
<br />
We medded up, everyone at full health and went into the basement. The pit was camped, we went to the blood pool and cut down a hag in about 10 seconds, a TT in half that time. We get to the ghost room, after a quick med and there's the ghost.<br />
<br />
It turned bad on us. No one could get spells to stick. The lvl 32 enchanter cast 9 spells for a TOTAL of 300 HP damage, the paladins were missing alot and the ghost was max hitting everyone for 60 HP per attack, and he has dual attack and bash (or kick, I forget). <br />
<br />
Yes, some folks died. But I know that there was NOTHING more I could have done. Everyone had EVERY buff that was worth anything. (Endure disease would have been worthless.) And I healed till totally zero mana.<br />
<br />
Did I feel horrible about it? Oh yes. I was very sad for our fallen heroes. But I took some comfort in the fact that I could not have done any MORE to keep them alive.<br />
<br />
So I guess from my perspective, it's not the idea that this or that buff is not efficient, or costly or whatever, it's that I think as a cleric, I owe my group EVERY last effort I can provide in keeping them alive.<br />
