</FONT><HR>I've spent a great deal of time learning to be a good cleric.  I think all classes by the time you pass 50 have a pretty good understanding of how their peticular class works and try to play their character in a way that best suites their class.  All classes except monks it would seem at least.<P>Perhaps I just have had really bad luck, but its been quite a long time since I have grouped with a monk that I didn't have to "educate".  Sure they can pull, but they come running back to the group and then stand there and tank.  The warriors trying to pick up agro and is taunting away but the mobs still pounding on the monk.  I would think any monk would know that he should FD to help the warrior pick up agro but they don't, I've had to ask them to do it so much I've actually made a hot key for it.<P>Deuragon says, "Monk please FD after pulling to allow the warrior to pick up agro quicker"<P>Now I know in every class there are some idiots but I just don't think I've had this much trouble with any other class on such a regular basis.  Anyone else experiencing the same sort of thing?<BR><P>------------------<BR>Deuragon Deathbane<BR>~ If your not dying, your just not trying.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>What I have done in these instances is said "Monk- whats your AC?  Whats your HP?  MainTank- whats your AC? whats your HP?" Sometimes the melee-who-shouldnt-be-tanking gets the picture. Sometimes not.  Sometimes you have to add "We can kill much faster if the group can conserve the healers mana.  This is best done by only healing one person."<P>Btw, I group almost exclusively with a 60 monk as the main tank.  Her high dodge, fast damage-dealing abilities, great disc's allow us to do lots of zones and lots of things.  So- dont discount the monk as main tank.<P>Shaiel<BR>Heirophant<P>Leonidas<BR>Templar<P>Anneli<BR>Rogue</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Been there myself, but then I was doing pickup groups on the LOIO-FM-OT-DL-KC track (sigh).<P>I could not get it beat into the monk's head that he needed to "lose the aggro".  Mostly I sent him direct tells to try to get him to correct his fighting style, but it was getting to the point that he'd need to be confronted in guildchat.<P>Suffice it to say, I found other places to hunt that day.<P>Keeping aggro on the melee with the highest AC is the responsbility of all, the warrior/paladin/sk/ranger/monk can only do so much.<P>------------------<BR>Corish, 46 Cleric of Morell-Thule</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I don't have a problem with monks in groups. I do however have a problem with monks who can solo and I can't! <BR>If a monk in your group isn't following orders and making things harder for you tell them in no uncertain terms they are not to get agro again, you should not have to be wasting so much mana on them and if they continue to do so you'll be saving that mana for more productive members of the group. If they still keep it up either leave the group, or let them eat a death, maybe they need to learn the hard way. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Oh man!<P>Don't dizz monks, please! <P>/em lower lip starts to tremble<P>I simply love that class (my all time favourite alt is one). Think of them like a light wheight tank compared to warriors (ie. without taunt and the massive HPs of a warrior). <P>They have absolutely lovely skills - the highest defensive ones there is, FD (which is also excellent aggro control), fear (instill doubt - for fear kiting or tight situations), a separate damage table (the highest - the only melee class outdamaging a monk is the rogue), self heal (mend) etc etc<P>If You on top of all of this slaps a fungi and/or other high level gear You have one helluva asset to the group/raid/whatever.<P>My lil' monk twink is now level 51. He's got no velius quest armor or big MOB drops what so ever but he still has around 1030 in unbuffed AC (and will keep getting more, I'm sure). Getting good armor (not uber) for monks is quite easy if You have a high level main.<P>What I think You saw was simply a bad player who couldn't or wouldn't listen to either pieces of advice or direct orders. ANY monk worth his name knows how to control aggro.<P>So again: don't dizz monks!<P>/em takes a deep trembling breath and tries to look brave<P> <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Now this is a funny topic.<P>Up to level 50, you will need a SEVERELY twinked warrior to have him surpass the AC of a monk.<BR>After that level, warriors usually get really high AC nodrop gear, which lets them catch up and most likely go higher in AC than a similarly equipped monk.<P>Next time, ask both the monk and the maintank for their Ac (HP of the warrior WILL be higher 95% of the time, no question).<P>OR, try the innovative way, if you happen to camp mobs that are always the same type and level, let the warrior tank 5 of them, and after that let the monk tank 5 of them. See which costs more mana to heal.<P>Little story from a few months back:<BR>Kael Drakkal, the place known as Iceshard Keep. We're triggering Doldigun Steinweilder and his giant friends, which eventually results in a lvl 60 unslowable giant that hits for about 204 a pop.<BR>The cleric used less mana on me when I tanked him from start to finish, than on the warrior who tanked him.<BR>He was surprised  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=592" TARGET=_blank>Ronaan</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

There will always be mobs out there that need a warr to tank, that is just the way it is.

</FONT><HR>I think the situation described here isn't so much a class problem, as it is a problem with grouping with people who just don't play well.<P>I've grouped with plenty of clerics who don't time their heals well, who insist on meleeing or nuking in mana-intensive situations, etc.  Warriors who don't taunt.  Paladins who don't stun.  Druids who don't snare.<P>At level 59, I tank at least as well as any equivalently equipped warrior.  At the very high end, warriors take the lead on tanking of course... simply because their ac+hp are unmatched for things like tanking uber mobs.<P>Monks, since Kunark, as a class have seemingly attracted a disproportionate number of "idiot twinks".  People who think Monks are indeed just "warriors with less hp, more damage".  Monks, imho, are the easiest class in the game to twink and succeed at. (Much to my chagrin, Monks used to command a little respect, because it was hard to get to high levels using only your fists... but that's a whole different rant altogether.) Dual wield at level 1 is insanely powerful. <P>Fairly commonly you'll run into monks who were twinked, and have been soloing up into their 40s and decide to start grouping.  Having not gotten any better gear, they might now have sub-standard gear for tanking (and they think they still tank like a champ- going from FM Giants to Drolvarg Ragers) and they'll just stand there getting all the agro, and not feigning it off.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Like I said though, you'll get this with any class, especially twinks.  Perhaps Monks are noticed more by Clerics because a) a bad Monk REALLY gets trashed bad in a fight... I mean really bad, I know you all know that. and b) There are just so many bad monks out there these days.<P>------------------<BR><P>Geist Schattenfaust<BR>Master of the 59th Fist<BR>Xegony</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I can testify from both sides, I have a 54 (sooooo close to 55) cleric and a 49 monk. Monks make surprisingly good tanks, one of my favorite tanks for exp groups is a 57 monk in my guild. Typically until the very high end, monks have very comparable AC, but less hps. The block skill, though, is incredible, and reduces damage taken noticably. So for most exp groups, I don't really care one way or the other. But the warrior does tend to get his feelings hurt unless he's got aggro the whole time  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>The thing that DOES irritate me though, in a good exp group, is having the main tank be the same person as the puller, regardless of class. Two reasons: 1) If the group is functioning well, the puller should be able to leave the fight with about 25% of the mob's health left, to bring a new pull for maximum exp flow. If it is the same person, he has to wait until the fight is over, so more downtime. 2) The big one for me is that I don't like to send a puller out into a dangerous situation with less than 80% hps. If they are taking damage during the fight, all too often, their hps are high enough that CH seems like overkill (and 10secs of waiting), and remedy or Cel Heal isn't enough. If someone else had been taking the damage, I could have waited until I could have cast a more efficient CH. So from a mana management perspective, I prefer the puller and the MT to be different people, regardless of classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I think a LOT depends on level.  My warrior primary hunted with my husband's monk and a friend's cleric as a trio from 18 to about 44, starting in January 2000.  Needless to say, none of us were twinked ;p.  As a result though, it wasn't particularly efficient to use CH on me once the cleric had it, and my husband's monk could tank about as well as I could, especially when you factor in mend.  So, he'd bring back the mob, and take the initial damage, calling out when he used mend.  I'd let him drop maybe another bubble after that before trying to take aggro (and most of the time he had to feign it off).  The damage got shared so sometimes he needed a heal in addition to me, but it wasn't any less efficient -- my ac tended to be lower due to his natural ac, and I didn't really have the hitpoints to consistently use complete heal anyway.  If you're only using Superior or greater it tends to work out about the same anyway, especially if you dont lose damage dealt to repeat feigning off.<P>By not automatically feigning immediately on incoming we also didn't often have to pull the mob off of our cleric.  (Sometimes on difficult splits he was low enough to have to feign right away or need a quick heal).  <P>We retired at 47 and 48, but I could already see that as I got more hitpoints and better gear we were approaching the point where it made sense for me to tank it over him, but the switch still was not necessarily an automatic.  Perhaps the monk you grouped with was used to having better ac and comparable hitpoints, and hadn't yet adjusted to the switch, or perhaps he hadn't often hit that switch yet.<P>Loredena Mainacier   Warrior of the Tribunal<BR>The Revellers</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>A smart monk tanks quite well. One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is how to CH a monk.<P>A monk has 2 tools at their disposal that make them eminently CHable. Stonestance and Mend.<P>You can cut the CHs really close on a monk, if it looks like they won't make it, they can just hit stonestance and/or mend. So long as they have one of these in reserve, you can afford to cut the CHs awfully close.<P>This gives them more CHable HPs and makes up for some of the difference in HPs between a warrior and a monk.<P>The main thing that is lacking in monks as tanks is taunt.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>OMG.   NO NO NO NO.  <P>I am a lvl 60 monk in a raiding guild.  The one thing I hate most is the monk that pulls and then FDs it off right in front of camp.  They should stand right behind the warrior going to tank and stay there not attacking till the warrior gets it on him.  Why should you do this?  Becuase if you FD before it is agroed on the warrior, it is often likely that the entire raid will be put on its hate list all at one time.  <P>This means that anyone sitting is going to get smacked for 400+ damage very quickly.  Or if it is a flurry try 700+ and a flurry really quickly.  Also on many mobs your intial hate is capped on first entry and many mobs you won't get added to the hate list by being in the vacinity of them if they already have people on the hate list. (Classic example is having a lvl 50 person agro Nagefen then a lvl 60 can walk right under him and get AEed and still not get ported away or attacked.)  What does that mean?  That means if you aren't on the hate list and then you CH a warrior tanking that mob you are then added to the hate list but that first CH contains very little hate since you weren't on the hate list to begin with.<P>Now you are saying this isn't a raid environment we are talking about.  Again I still call bull****.  On a single or even multiple pull in an exp group a monk should still not fd.  Bring those mobs to camp and then hit stone stance.  You are now a super tank for 12 seconds.  Now instead of FDing and those mobs wacking people sitting, or all of those mobs going onto a warrior who is a far far inferior of a tank to you for 12 seconds he will only get one attacking him and it is easier for the crowd controllers to get stuff under control in those 12 seconds.  With this method I can nearly self heal myself.  Also since 2 or more mobs aren't attacking the warrior there is no need for the cleric to heal that warrior before all the mobs are controlled and they all go running off to smack that very same cleric around some.<P>Now that doesn't mean a monk should pull in and turn on attack before the warrior has agro.  But if I ever was told to FD when I pulled I would go off on that cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Good thread (Blame a Cleric who also plays a Monk for letting Monks know of this thread).<P>I was prompted to respond because I saw a Post by Prieter regarding the Monk Mend ability and Stonestance discipline.<P>About Mend:<BR>-----------<BR>a) It has a 6 minutes recycle time (ie it will ungrey for a Monk 6 minutes after it was last depressed).<P>b) It allows a Monk to heal 25% of his current total HP (which equates to about 1.25 red bubbles on his HP bar).  <P>Now, some Monks only use it as a last resort in Group fights to avoid death or give them more time to get off a successful Feign Death.  Other Monks (like me) like to use it if it's available AS SOON as we're down 1.25 red bubbles (IMO, it saves you Clerics manna, and allows us to make max use of it with it's 6 minute recycle time).  Also, some monks (me included) have a Group macro that sends the Group a message that we've used Mend (mine reads 'I've used Mend on myself').<P>I also have a Group macro that I press when my 'MEND' hotkey ungreys that reads:<P> 'My Mend ability is back!'<P>I bring this up because I've had some Clerics get mad at me because when they see the 'used Mend' message, some Clerics thought I was demanding a heal from them.  I have found that once I've explained why I have it, they like it because it helps them in deciding how best to manage heals if a situation gets nasty.  My advice to Clerics is that when you group with a Monk, ask him if he likes to Mend early (ie as soon as he is 1.25 red bubbles down), or late (ie only as a last rtesort, etc.).  That you don't waste a heal as the Monk hits Mend; or allow the Monk to die because as you wonder why he's not using Mend.<P>Stonestance: <BR>------------<BR>A) It has a base 12 minute recycle time at 51 (the Level where Monks get this), but that time decreases 1 minute for every level above 51.<P>B) It doesn't make us immune to damage, it just decreases the damage we take for 12 seconds (on average, a hit for 120 HPs will become a hit for 14 HPs, etc.)  <P>C) EQ displays the following message in /say when we hit the stonestace button.  For me, it would read:<P>'Chilau becomes one with the Earth'<P>Also, a Monk may use 'Stonestance' when actually split pulling a MOB from a group of MOBs, so if your Monk is doing a lot of split pulling, it's doubtful he has this discipline available during the Group fight.<P>BTW - I think most Monks will agree with you guys in that a Monk who doesn't learn to control his aggro deserves the scorn of Clerics, Groupmates and Guildmates alike.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

I celestial the monk after he FD's and CH the warrior when ever he is at 30-40 percent life.

</FONT><HR>All these player-haters in here droppin' posts to bring out the trolls.<P>I've played virtually every class in EQ at some point or another and had enough sense to stop playing the ones I sucked at.  Classes have <B>absolutely nothing</B> to do with a person's grouping abilities.  If they're a moron, they'll suck just as much as a Monk as they would a Ranger or Cleric.  I dunno why thats such a hard concept to grab.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I'd like to comment on this from a monks perspective.<P>Depending on the zone, i'm am the tank of my exp group 90% of the time.  Why is this?  <P>For one reason I have good ac and hp, plus the monk damage mitigation, and a fair amount of regen.<P>The second and probably the most important reason is that unless there is an above-average warrior, paladin, or sk in the group I can command aggro for the whole fight.  Commanding aggro and keeping it is an important thing.<P>There are many times where I play my monk as the puller/tank and the main cleric in the frenzy room in VL, chardok etc.  It is nice only having to CH myself and not have to keep other people alive.  Cleric only has to heal one person.<P>In most exp situations a well-equiped monk will use less healing mana than any tank class. Monk has mend, and stone stance that recycles very quickly.  Experience is not one ore two big mobs it's continuous, and warriors don't have a good way to get free health back over time like a monk does.  Also a monk and FD and stop damage taken at any point in the fight.  <P>Frankly i'm sorry that you've had such a bad experience with monks taking aggro that shouldn't.  If i'm in a group where a big tank is there and I know it will be more efficient to drop aggro I do.  But I rarely find a big tank to exp with and end up being the tank.<P><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=58130">Qing Lao Hu</a><br><BR><a href="http://pub33.ezboard.com/beqrip">Rest In Peace</a></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008334-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008334-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008334&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008334&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
