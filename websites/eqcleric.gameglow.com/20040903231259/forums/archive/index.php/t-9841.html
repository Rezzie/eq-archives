<br />
&quot;What does it drop?&quot;. <br />
<br />
I've been hunting in Kunark for the past week. Its great fun, I've even been pulling a little solo duty now and again. Anyhow, I swear I've heard that statement in non-guild/non-friend groups more than anything else, lately.<br />
<br />
I say something like:<br />
&quot;Hey, wanna go whup some_mobs_00? Great exp!&quot;<br />
<br />
They say :<br />
&quot;Hmmm, never done that...What do they drop?&quot;<br />
<br />
What is *up* with that? Now I like items as much as the next guy, but I just tend to base my play-time on 2 things.<br />
<br />
1) Fun<br />
2) Experience<br />
<br />
I'll forgo #2 in a second if it affects #1. ( e.g no fun, awesome exp, I'll leave in a second if something fun pops up, even for no exp )<br />
<br />
Sigh. Now, I will take some time and go hunt for items I need, or help friends/guildies get items they need, but in normal everyday play, this isn't even a consideration.<br />
<br />
Am I just being silly?<br />

This game is about phat lewt, bitching about class imbalance and annoying the hell out of your fellow players by begging, training and talking about last night football game in /shout.<br />
 Of course, there are those of us, who go and poke a sand giant just for kicks (sand giant's kicks, that is).</div></div><hr />

I'd like to know.  I don't usually care, I'll go try it anyway, I'd just like to know for general knowledge.<br />
