<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 04:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scenario:  Your guild zones in en mass into Kael to kill King Tormax. When you zone in you find a weaker guild with 20ish folks gathering for him as well. You have a small (10-15 min) window of opportunity to do the kill before the other guild gets the number of people they need to have a sufficient force.<br />
<br />
Do you:<br />
<br />
A) Kill Tormax anyway, ignoring the other guild?<br />
<br />
B) Let the other guild take their time getting their members there, buffing, and learning how to pull, while you find something else to do?<br />
<br />
C) Offer to team up with them, taking the mob if they refuse?<br />
<br />
D) Offer to team up with them, leaving them the mob if they refuse?<br />
<br />
E) None of the above</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtan Honorshield</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">F) All of the above.<br />
<br />
It depends on what other mobs are up, on if our &quot;assholier&quot; members are online, on which guild the other one is (do we like them or not)...<br />
<br />
Personally i prefer option B, if possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johrena</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(Gonna respond as if you’re Stranger_01)  <br />
<br />
A) Kill Tormax anyway, ignoring the other guild?<br />
<br />
Most people do not play the game to watch others fail.  It’s just sometimes a by-product of your guild trying to reach their own successes.  I try to believe there is good in people and they play this game to have fun.  Some people, much like yourself, are forced to make the hard choice and play the bad guy.  That is not in any way your fault, but just the nature of the beast.  With the game in its current state there isn’t always enough content to amuse everyone.  The people that put in the time to reach this lvl of the game want the challenges.  After you’ve done old world content a few times… you’re not going to be as satisfied as you were when you first went.  For myself, I like mobs where the outcome is totally in the air.  The challenge is what drives me the most in this game.<br />
<br />
Therefore, here you are in a zone, in full raid force, and guild_01 is trying a mob for the first time.  Hell, you might even have friends in the other guild.  Sure, it’s good PR and the nice thing to do to let them attempt this mob.  However, do not fool yourself into thinking if the roles were reversed you would be giving the same opportunity.  Karma is fickle that way.<br />
<br />
B) Let the other guild take their time getting their members there, buffing, and learning how to pull, while you find something else to do?<br />
<br />
As simple as this sounds…. Hey, good luck with Mob_01 we will walk away and go kill Mob_02, which might not work out either.  As you begin the process of moving your troops to go take out Mob_02, some five zones away, unknown to you there is a force gathering to kill Mob_02.  Most of your people are either there or in transit to this new location and have been denied, yet again, to another mob.  That means more time wasted.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As easy as it seems to wish the other guild well, you’re not always able to do that.  Being in a position to make that choice is never as straightforward as it seems to everyone else.  It’s generous to let the smaller guild attempt a new mob.  However, you have to ask yourself, at what cost?  You have a responsibility to your guild members that are there as well as keeping the bigger picture in mind.  I don’t envy your position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayne</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two months ago or so we decided to try Velketor.  Since we're small (18 characters, maybe 9 players at the time) we didn't take long to get in front of his room.  In the meantime, several representatives from a larger, but certainly not uber (not NToV capable, but certainly Velk capable) guild sends us tells.  The bottom line: take as long as we want, they'll get him when we give up.  And they did let us take as long as we wanted.  Five wipes w/o Cleric epic was enough for us.<br />
<br />
Fast forward two months to Wednesday night.  Velk is up again and our mighty 18 is looking for something to do, specifically Velketor.  We have 2 GB Wizards now, our Rogues have all levelled to 60, and our MT has gained 600 hit points.  The problem: two other guilds are marching on Velk for a joint attempt.  I ascertain where they are and tell my guild we can beat them to Velk without any difficulty.  We can fight down much quicker than them (for some reason I've noticed we can move 3 characters each faster than many guilds who only have a single character per player), toss a few buffs, and charge.  However, we decide to chill out thinking back to a few months ago when the situation was reversed.<br />
<br />
So, we kill &quot;Lord Bob&quot; while we wait and then pop into Kael Drak to do some caster quest.  They finally pull and wipe (40 players =P) while we're in Kael.  I ask someone their plans and they tell me to re-try.  We sigh, say ok, and go kill Trak.  The zone later resets before they are finished buffing for 2nd attempt (like over 2 hours later - damn that's slow).<br />
<br />
Were we nice or TOO nice?  It's just a problem in the game.  Mobs don't reset fast enough for the situation (players banded together into powerful killing machines) Verant created.  What in hell did Verant think was going to happen once they forced players to band together into groups of 50-75+?  Once those players killed the targets they gathered together for did Verant think they'd just pop back into Sebilis or Velks?  Blah.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherazade</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a member of a &quot;medium-sized&quot; guild we find ourselves in both sides - for some mobs we are the experienced guild for some others we still try to find our way. We as a guild most of the time choose B if we zone in somewhere and we find another guild preparing for the big mob we planned. We don't look what guild they are, or what numbers they have (well we look if they have the numbres close to do it or if its only 3 people claiming to do it). We then move and go for another target.<br />
<br />
Well on the other side - we had almost everything yet when we were in the zone - preparing and some other guild zoned in.<br />
<br />
A) Incredibly rude - we had this a while ago with a guild in VP - not only it gave them a bad reputation on our server - they also had big problems within guild right after. It may bring you a triumphe on the first sight, but on a long term view it ruins more.<br />
<br />
B) One way to do, makes the other guild feel respected<br />
<br />
C) If this happened to me, I wouldn't feel respected.<br />
<br />
D) We had this the other night with Vindi/Statue/AoW. We very much appreciated the offer, because we really were low on numbers and we were pleased to learn from their tactics. Loot was handled fair in between the two guilds and we had a great time.<br />
<br />
E) we also had the case that a guild let us do Doze - and waited at the door to walk over our corpses when we failed - I didn't find it a very good way to handle competition, but its a way. Smaller / not so experienced guild would like to learn from their mistakes and try to improve - it's hard to do with some other guild in your neck and forcing you to kill mob xxx in yyy time /shrug <br />
<br />
There is a lot to do in the game - and just because a guild has planned to do something doesn't mean they have to do it - we are all flexible, aren't we? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hamin</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What our guild does is,<br />
1) who was in the zone first?<br />
         A) if the other guild, do they have the numbers?<br />
                    If no, we give them x amount of time to get their force in place.  We let them know if they are not moving on the mob after time has past we will.  We usually give 20-30 minutes on average. <br />
<br />
2) If we don't know the answer to 1, and both forces have the numbers.  We ask their raid/guild leader to /random 1 100 with our raid/guild leader, if we lose we move to another location.<br />
<br />
3) We have an agreement with most guilds equal to power as us, first guild with 18 people in zone gets the mob/s<br />
<br />
We try not to hang around, in force, in zone to rush another guild if they are trying a mob.<br />
<br />
Something to keep in mind is that most mobs do respawn, so if you don't get the mob this time, you could get it next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Johrena</div><div class="date">08-16-2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sherazade,<br />
<br />
That’s just it… in scenario A it’s a fact of the game.  If you don’t have your shit together you can’t expect to c*ckblock the other guild.  If you want to learn that’s all find and dandy… show up WITH your raid force there.  Don’t sit at the zonein and say, please don’t take Mob_01 because we want to spend 5 hours learning how to do it.  <br />
<br />
Now for your scenario in E… again, it’s the game.  IN FACT your scenario on E is the rules of PnP.  If your guild fails the first time… rules are you’re done.  It’s called taking turns and it’s happen on our server.  GM was called and Guild_01 was told to move on… and let Guild_02 take the mob.  It sucks because Guild_01 was trying to learn the mob but GM was called and said… see ya later bye…. Because that is the rule.  Sometimes that rules in your favor and sometimes it's not.<br />
<br />
Sure be nice, let the guild you know is going to die try it a time or two… but come on already.  Move on, you can’t do it… try another day… do your HOMEWORK!<br />
<br />
This is just an example:<br />
Say you have 12 people killing FG on their way to take out Naggy.  However, 36 people zone in ready to kill Naggy.  Now 12 people aren’t going to be able to take out Naggy on their first try.  How long should you wait and watch those 12 people die over and over again?  I say once, maybe twice and then tell them to do their homework.  That’s fair.  They need to find out what it takes to kill the mob: force, strats or whatever.<br />
<br />
If they want to learn to kill higher lvl mobs.. pick a mob that isn’t in so much contention with other guilds.  T-max lives just a matter of hours (hell, mins) when he’s up so pick on something that not every guild and their mother is trying to kill.<br />
<br />
I’m all for letting a guild learn… I think it’s kewl that higher lvl guilds give them a chance.  (That’s why my guild rocks)  But how many chances do they get… how many hours do you wait and watch a guild die?? <br />
<br />
It sucks that this happens just about everyday on ever server…. But people are trying to play the game and do what they do best… raid.  VI created this beast and people are just trying to play within the limits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, you say there is lots to do in the game.  You’re correct.  But just because PoH is open doesn’t mean a guild that’s move FAR beyond that is going to want to raid there.  There is a limit to what a guild can or wants to do.  Once PoP is out there for everyone... it should open things up a little more.  But when you have 5 guilds doing all the top end stuff... there isn't much up to do sometimes.  =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LaotzuQigong</div><div class="date">08-19-2002, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, having been in this boat many times before both as a guild member, former guild leader, and officer at one time or another, I think it all depends.<br />
<br />
If I run into this situation, I tend to ask a couple of questions...<br />
<br />
1)  Is this mob generally considered FCFS or FFA?  There is a very significant difference between the two.  FFA tends to mean whoever can engage first ala Lodizal.  FCFS tends to imply whoever has a capable raid force in place at the mob (IE, sufficient minimal numbers to have a chance at the mob).<br />
<br />
2)  Who is the guild in question?  Do we have good relations with this guild?  Have they extended us similar courtesies in the past?  Or have they been equally as happy to run over us/camp us/train us in order to get to a mob?<br />
<br />
3)  Is this a guild who directly competes with us?  Guilds that are on or near your level don't need a &quot;leg up&quot; so to speak, they fend for themselves just fine thank you.  Those that are a tier below, it's nice to give them a chance to learn and take a spin when the opportunity presents itself.<br />
<br />
4)  Are there other reasonable target available?  It's easy to be generous when every mob is up, it's when you haven't seen a mob in 3 or 4 days or possibly weeks that things get dicey.  I don't know about your servers, but on our server most everything is dead within 48 hours of patch.  What that means is that a guild needs to be competitive if they want any mobs at all.  It's nice to be generous, however, the end result of being too generous can be impeding the progress of your guild.<br />
<br />
So, in answer to your question...<br />
<br />
A) It depends.<br />
<br />
B) It depends.<br />
<br />
C) We don't team up on raids unless it's something like Plane of Fear where we want CT and the other guild just wants armor drops.<br />
<br />
D) See C. <br />
<br />
As for sitting behind another guild while they make an attempt and going after the mob afterwards, we rarely do that though we have done it to a few select guilds.  Usually, this is to a directly competitive guild who's done this or something similar to us first.<br />
<br />
IE, our primary philosophy tends to be, do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  However, if they do something else, return the favor in full.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightGod</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally, Drinal supports (and follows) first in force.<br />
<br />
The arguements start when the definition of sufficient force comes into play =P But the public as a whole generally can figure things out pretty quick and will support the ones who are right.<br />
<br />
And for a guild trying a mob for the first time, generally the guilds on Drinal are pretty cool about letting them wipe over and over or take as long as they need to buff up/prep for it. A good example of this is HoT....at one time there were about 7 guilds regularly farming HoT and we had a pretty decent idea of when you could expect to find it open. An up and coming guild wanted to give it a try, posted and asked around a bit and got a very supportive response. They pretty much had HoT totally to themselves for 24 hours. Rhags are a more up to date example. The resident &quot;live in Ssra, first emp kill on the server&quot; uber guild has been really awesome lately about calling in other guild when the Rhags spawn since they no longer need the loot from them, usually sharing strats and throwing in a little firepower if the guild they contact doesn't have all the peeps they need online at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldur</div><div class="date">08-21-2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What laotzu said (heh from same guild).<br />
<br />
However one time we went for yelinak at the same time as another guild (first guild on server to VT).  Anyhow we got plenty of people there and they had 23 people.  Since we wanted to kill the mob and they insisted they had a raid force, we decided to give them first shot.  They tried, and wiped out.<br />
<br />
We then waited for it to regen up to full and tried it, to find one of their members running around destroying all of the rods, and tradespamming our clerics (I had trade turned on by mistake and was one of the clerics in the chain who got continously traded with).  Needless to say with clerics in the chain getting interupted and no mod rods, and with pretty poor tactics (we know much better ways of doing it now) we also died.<br />
<br />
So it goes to show, it doesn't always pay to be nice.  <br />
<br />
Typically I would be from option a, unless the guild was one that I liked and we had other stuff we could do.  But if my guild is bored and theres something to kill, and others don't have sufficent numbers to try it at present then theres no shame in killing it.  Its not a question of getting what it drops, but doing a raid of some description.</div></div><hr />

Hey!  Sounds a lot like my guild.  We're almost all of us n-boxing.  I 4-box (3 on raids), my guild leader 6-boxes and almost every last one of us has at least 2 accounts.  And yes, we're small.  We haven't succeeded on Velketor yet though.  I think if the druid healing change goes in we might be able to.  :) <br />
<br />
FYI:  I like to take the friendly, non-confrontational approach and not race people to mobs.  So in my book you all did the right thing.  <br />
<br />
Yes, Verant needs to make more uber mobs pop more often so there isn't this perpetual conflict.</div></div><hr />
