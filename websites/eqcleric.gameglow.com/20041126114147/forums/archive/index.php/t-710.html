Humans are night blind.  Paineel clerics have a quest for a helmet that gives the wearer the effect of the necro spell &quot;deadeye&quot; (infravision and see invisible).  For a non-evil cleric to do this quest they have to effectively destroy their a part of their &quot;non-evil&quot; faction.  To date I have not seen ANY quest for a helmet that non-evil human clerics can perform, much less one confering night vision.  <br />
<br />
Many clerics have asked for some simple utility spells shared by other casting classes (like night vision, invisibility and levitate for example).  <br />
<br />
A simple way for Verant to fulfill this request would be to add some quests, that can be done by all clerics, that will yield items that grant these abilities.<br />
<br />
What do you think fellow cleircs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, a Regent Symbol of Bristlebane would be fun: what effect would you put on the symbol of the trickster god?  Shadowstep?  Or how about Illusion: Troll?  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boanerges</div><div class="date">08-01-2000, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, this is the worst quest in the world for good Erudite clerics such as myself. For humans it's no big deal because, honestly, who needs good Erudin faction if you're not an Erudite? Just camp the guards for a while or kill a few emissaries.<br />
<br />
But Erudin is the only place where I am amiable to everyone, where I can buy and sell quite well. That faction is one of the few I truly care about (that and the Priest of Life  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif)<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a good set of questable armor that good clerics can do.<br />
<br />
The problem is other races complain. Think about how many deity specific questable items are out there. Only one to my knowledge and it's for Dark Elves. Not complaining about DEs getting a quest, but that they are the only ones with a quest specific to their god.<br />
<br />
I don't want to start a flame war but every time this gets brought up the fact that we can do other quests is thrown in our face. &quot;You can do temple quests. Stop whining&quot; &quot;You have the Aegis. Stop whining.&quot; To my knowledge these all require some work with factions, even for some &quot;good&quot; clerics. I'm not asking for massive quests here, but I'd love to get an item to show the devotion of my character too.<br />

<br />
On another note I see there is a new quest for barbarian shamans, the Initiate Symbol of the Tribunal... so it looks like they are slowly but surely adding quests for all gods.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif Can't wait!<br />

I like the fact that clerics are starting to diversify based upon their religions - this should have been the case from the start. I also have to say it's a good thing that DEs finally got something to quest for; if anyone was screwed with quests in this game it was the dark elves, for (insert your diety's name here)'s sake, they didn't even have a newbie quest from their guildmaster.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this portends that clerics of every religion will have religion-specific quests. I would say that gnomes should be the next to get something; I know that high elves, halflings and dwarves are loaded with quests they can do. Maybe they even will fix the vendors at the gnome cleric guild to sell all the proper spells.</div></div><hr />

I hear you.<br />
<br />
There were &quot;more&quot; spells added last April, but they are still severely lacking.  Only two 49th level spells to be found there ... had to go to Kaladim, and visit our Brell-brethern there to obtain the spells.<br />
<br />
I think the game company has delibrately neglected gnome clerics due to lack of players.  Why else purposely leave out the majority of the spells when the vendors were supposedly fixed?<br />
