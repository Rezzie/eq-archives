My BP is green and my head piece is chain.  But I  am over half purple.  Yet I still get asked almost daily for ports and sows.  Not just from the begging newbs in WC, that I could almost understand, but from all levels and in all zones.  I've even got the statement &quot;Halflings can be Clerics?&quot; a number of times.  We're more populous than Gnomes (so I've been told), yet even Gnomes seem to be accepted as Clerics more than Halflings.  I sometimes wish we could put bumper stickers on our armor so that i could put &quot;I am not a Druid&quot; on my BP.<br />
<br />
Ok I know there's too many halfling Druids running around for it to ever change.  Even if i get full Hate gear, I'll get those request.  But I'm running out of witty remarks for those request.  Any you other Halflings got any orignal ones?</div></div><hr />

My take on bristlebane is that he's more evil then good anyway, so I tend to be darker then most halflings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I'm on Sow Strike.<br />
I never bought that spell.<br />
That spell wouldn't scribe in my spellbook.<br />
/em looks around and doesn't see any druids, rangers, or shaman.<br />
And the one that really pisses them off - &quot;Can I have sow plz?&quot;  &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hey, I'm a priest of mischief whaddaya expect?  :D <br />
<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, I've had some people ask me REALLY nicely hehe.  Even had a level 40 cuss me out and tell me what a stupid druid I was for not buying sow, and how now I wasn't getting the 20pp he was gonna give me :rolleyes:  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">08-24-2002, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess we've all done the throw Shield of Words on them. tell them &quot;There you go&quot; and then watch them stand dumbfounded while they figure it out.<br />
<br />
My latest SOW reply &quot; Sure see if they'll hit me with it too&quot;<br />
<br />
My latest port &quot; Ok just tell me when your dead and I'll port you right back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Too many don't get it though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is a typical set up<br />
<br />
SowWanter(for the sake of example, a monk): Can I have sow plz<br />
Me: Sure, only if you can give me a TP<br />
SowWanter: Im not a wizzy<br />
Me: IM NOT A SOWER!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Huffadopolis</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you have some money to throw around, buy a sow potion or two and use it on yourself whenever you get asked for sow.  Then run off, and send a tell to the person that asked and say &quot;Hey that was a good idea, thanks&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crowgoth</div><div class="date">08-25-2002, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a lot of stupid peeps out there.  I'm a dwarf and I still get sow requests.  My shaman gets port requests and I even had a rez one - she's a troll.</div></div><hr />

oh well :p <br />
<br />
heh i have been asked for clarity, sow, corpse summon, porting and levitate...<br />
and i havefull SS armor with epic and everytime this has happened i have been nonanon.  and also had the stupid people standing in front of me.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabal</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason I am often asked &quot;Hey, Dark Elves have their own clerics now?&quot; :)<br />
<br />
And many people also confuse me with a necromancer (ever seen a necro in full plate?) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sherazade</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my boyfriend is a woodelf bard  - and even when he still had his lambent/SS outfit and was using his lute, people asked him for ports and sow.<br />
<br />
I got sometimes asked for KEI /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knobbs</div><div class="date">08-26-2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did the shield of words thing to a younger character. He seemed very pleased and ran off. Never worked out whether he was happy because he had his SOW or whether it was because he had a &quot;high level&quot; AC buff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fhylden</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It never fails to strike me as ironic when my halfling ranger is standing next to my halfling cleric, and someone runs up and asks Fhylden for sow.  I always reply &quot;I'm a cleric. I can't sow&quot;.  Sometimes,  they'll ask my ranger for sow, sometimes not.  What's worse is the ports.  I'll have people I've grouped with all night as a cleric ask me for a port at the end.  People I CH'ed a few times.  I even had guildmates ask me for ports!  It's an epidemic!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a gnome, I only wear robes, but carry a mace and shield.<br />
<br />
Here's what I got last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;TL to bind plz&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Port me to BB plz&quot;<br />
<br />
Beggar: &quot;May I please have SoW?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;Um, I'm a gnome&quot;<br />
Beggar: &quot;Gnomes can't be druids?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;If they could, I'm sure nature would look a little differently&quot;<br />
<br />
/who all beggar<br />
[57 MAG] Beggar (Gnome) &lt;Unknown Guild&gt;<br />
<br />
WTF!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gorgoni, I'll have to try that one out some time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clockwork Bra and Panties anyone?<br />
<br />
I think that would be fabulous!<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me.</div></div><hr />

Tickticktickticktick<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL they would kill Tunare and replace her with a clockwork.  Then probably cut down all the trees - yah for gnome druids!  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kimbera</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My low-level paladin got asked for his first port a couple of days ago.<br />
<br />
Ignore the fact that he was holding a two-handed sword.  Ignore the fact that hes wearing the newbie armor (full yellow plate).  Ignore the fact that he's not /anon or /role and /who CLEARLY shows him as a paladin.<br />
<br />
But the person asking was in his low 20s... I would con green to him at 13.  Even if the character WAS a druid, he STILL couldn't port.<br />
<br />
But, he's a halfling, so... u port /sow me plz kthx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgoni</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes... mine is ingeneous... makes lots of people laugh too... then after what I say they say something like:<br />
<br />
&quot;HUH? Oh! LMAO... Sorry Dude&quot;<br />
<br />
Its very effective<br />
<br />
It works best with classes that look like others (Monk wearing robe = Wizard... other examples I can think of: asking for Crack from a Mage) or doing something completely random works too: Ask a melee for levitate...ect...ect.... I think you can come up with your own I am sure... I am just too lazy to think up a whole bunch right now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gorgoni</div><div class="date">08-27-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yes... another fun thing to do is use your hide skill... remember... us halflings get it... another thing I do:<br />
<br />
SoWWanter: Can I have sow plz?<br />
Me: MUHAHAHAHA<br />
SoWWanter: ?<br />
Me *uses hide skill*<br />
<br />
Its fun to just sit them sit and stare and wonder what the hell just happened... unless of course they got see invis up... then it kinda sucks and makes you look weird :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aorion</div><div class="date">08-28-2002, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Humm we seem to have run out of ideas quick.  Not good for us tricksters.  Come on, quick being a trick hog.  Own up.  How about the leve/invis request while sitting in DL at the rings?  Anyone ever throw a invis undead and have someone actually believe that they were invised?</div></div><hr />
