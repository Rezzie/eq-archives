<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">02-06-2000, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went to Kedge Keep for the first time today, to help a ranger friend complete his Raincaller quest.  A few observations:<br />
<br />
You need 2 people that can cast enduring breath -- and watch your time!  It's a little scary to see that icon flashing when your puller just said &quot;incoming&quot; !!!<br />
<br />
If you just want to pull to the zone, and get a little experience with the area, a group of 34's or 35's should do great.  Saw a 35 ranger / 37 bard doing well there -- then later the ranger solo'd adequately.  Like any dungeon zone, you'll be fighting the &quot;yard trash&quot; (my Unrest days still stick with me), but it's pretty good experience -- and tons of pulls that you can grab singly or in pairs.  Just make sure you've got a good puller that knows what they are doing.<br />
<br />
If you're higher level, I'd suggest going to the south room.  If you go down the hole in the first room, and go straight out when you get a chance, you'll be in the south room.  Don't go down past the first openings  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  Then you can pull to there -- and pull the other 3 rooms, plus the 3 piranha/mermaids from the room above (that is where the ranger quest mermaid spawns).  We pulled a ton of sharks, piranha, piercers, swordfish, mermaids...  In a fairly short period saw around a quarter or half bubble experience at level 40.  Our group was primarily 40, with a 42 wiz and 36 enc.  We often got 2 at once, one yellow and one blue -- or both yellow even.  Loot was mediocre, a few pp, lots of sharkskin etc.  Can get one of the totemic armor quest items though...<br />
<br />
If you don't have a bard singing the jig to restore stamina, plan on keeping extinguish fatigue mem'd.  You'll be using it a lot!<br />
<br />
The best part of the zone -- other than the pair / solo at the zone, no one in the zone.  We had it to ourselves -- and we didn't go very deep -- that place could easily hold 3 or 4 more groups our level and no one would ever run out of pulls.  We could barely keep up with the few rooms we were trying to hunt!  Seemed to be a 17 minute or 18 minute respawn rate.<br />
<br />
Any of you more experienced folks care to elaborate more?  Like where to find the good stuff -- and what level you need to be? (drools at the thought of an abolone gorget)<br />

As many blues as we wanted, usually 1 or 2 at a time.  Be careful as there are some higher level fish (red to me) nearby - and if you get a bad pull you'll want to zone.  BTW - fish are animals, so druids can charm them which can help immensely on a multiple fish pull.<br />
<br />
Also, in addition to having two enduring breath casters, invest 10 plats or so in a potion of water breathing.  One of our breath casters went LD and I wound up drowning as the other one was OOM when breath started flashing for the 5 of us.  BTW - you drown faster than you can gate so be sure to start your gate while you still have a bubble of air left.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrach</div><div class="date">04-24-2000, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a level 35 with a full group of other level 35s I pulled good exp from here, and being a DE it was a welcome change of scenery (though that swimming sound gets old fast).  We pulled to the entrance, but what was really impressive was the logistics of staying below water the entire time.  The magician summoned everyone bags of enduring breath stones and the enchanter cast a buff on everyone that kept our stamina high.  Healing did not aggro the mobs, so this made for a very safe adventure.  Loot was horrible, but exp was good.</div></div><hr />
