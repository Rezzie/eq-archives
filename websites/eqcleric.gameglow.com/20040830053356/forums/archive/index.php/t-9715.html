<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vervain</div><div class="date">11-01-1999, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so I'm headed from Guk to the commons to rez an ogress friend of mine who got a little to close to a hostile NPC there, and I stop to chat with some folks I know in Oasis.  Some bronze-wearing female comes running by with a SG beating on her.  I root it, and it starts hitting me.  It's down maybe 1/5 or its hits (It has 80% left).  I step back.  It starts wailing on other young folk around (this is just north of the docks).  I step back and lay a couple of stun/wraths on it to keep it's attention while my friends and the rest of the smaller folk run.  It comes for me, and I root/wrath it down.  Some gnomish caster (necro I think) starts bitching me out for stealing his kill.  I'm a little bit adrenaline rushed, so I say, Hey, it was beating on some small folk, and on me, so I killed it.  Do your kiting away from the lower-level population.  He starts calling me names, bitching at me in general, and griping about the loot.  Sheesh, a bloodstone ring and 8-10 plat or so.  I give him the loot and  take off 'cause my friends 2 hour timer is running.  For the next half hour random people are /telling me bitching about how I KS'ed this SG.  Do I need a hotkey for &quot;Hey, is this monster claimed, or has he just wasted a party and is looking to vent his aggro on everthing and everybody?&quot;  Damn, I was just trying to keep some low levels from dying the way I used to all the time in oasis when I was their level.  What's the proper thing to do in cases like this, other than stand by and watch the moster decimate the croc slayers?</div></div><hr />

Personally, I detest people who kite, its the cheapest method yet invented to gain XP.  I totally agree with you, someone has to look out for those of lower level with moron's with DoT spells run all over creation.  Continue doing what you are doing and /ignore the rest.<br />

'Some bronze-wearing female runs by'<br />
<br />
'Gnomish caster starts bitching me out'<br />
<br />
Where in the nine hells do you get a reason to hate druids in this?  They can neither be gnomes nor wear bronze, so the one thing neither of these people were was a druid.<br />
<br />
You don't care who or what they are that bother you, if you can blame those evil druids, do you?<br />
<br />
By Brell's brass boots, I'm ashamed to be ranked with the lot of you so-called holy men.<br />
<br />
Bah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vervain</div><div class="date">11-11-1999, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moan's right, the gnome was (most probably) a necro doing the DOT thing.  True, most kiters are still druids, but in Oasis, there are many necros and even wizards getting in on the act.  I'm feeling better, though, was playing with my new AE spell and a newbie troll was being mobbed my about 6 froggies outside Guk.  I stepped up, cast, and they all dropped.  I tossed Heal/Valor/Armour/Symbol on her and sent her on her way mumbling about &quot;big nice mojo lady&quot;.  About an hour later, a 35th level troll SK came up, thanked me for helping his &quot;lil sister&quot; and tried to give me a Savant's Cap.  I thanked him and told him that I don't do it for rewards, but to spread good will.  He promised to save three newbies from themselves in my honour.  Spread the word, and it will come back to you someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilaraa</div><div class="date">11-11-1999, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. We are there to help if we can. I was in guk looking for a group and some low level puller brought an army of Frogloks with him. Use the Area Effect spell 3 times, DA and DB and helped them all escape. nobody died and not a word about Kill Stealing.<br />
<br />
Stupid kiters need to kill where they are not endangering the entire population.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moan</div><div class="date">11-11-1999, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with that last point.  I have nothing against kiting, and play a druid myself when not grouped with me paladin bother, Groan.<br />
<br />
I don't kite, however, it's not terribly efficient after the nerfing.  More fun to porcupine anyway. =)<br />
<br />
The important part is that kiting or not, you should take the big prey AWAY from high-travelled areas, not through the middle of them.  If you drag your SG through a crowd of people, you deserve to have the kill taken, and you deserve to be vilified.<br />
<br />
As for this unadulterated hate of druids, I can only assume it's the next variant of the 'I hate Kill-Stealin' wizards' posts that were so prevelant early in the game's release.<br />
<br />
Always remember that you can dislike one person, but if you spaout hate about the entire class, you're talking about literally THOUSANDS of people you've never met, and any of us who ready the posts become QUITE perturbed.<br />
<br />
Personally, I play warrior, cleric, druid, enchanter, shaman, and necromancer.  Several of those chars have fallen by the wayside, as I find my true calling is that of healer.  Druid or Cleric, I find I can be extremely helpful to those around me as either one.<br />
<br />
Seeing people say such hateful things when they are so obviously wrong puts those saying it in a worse light than the &amp;lt;insert hated class here&amp;gt; that they try to blame.<br />
