I've found it as nice steady experience.  Last night I was surprised to see Iksar Crusader(guard) come to meet me all the way to the Goblin Ruins east of the lake.<br />
<br />
Was it normal for the guard to wonder this far from Cabilis?  If so, is there are a safer place to hunt?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Obek</div><div class="date">09-26-2000, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing this also.  The bloodgills have between 1300 and 1400 hps, so 3 Retributions take them down.<br />
<br />
They spawn in several locations and always with 2 next to each other.  To split them I root one, pull the other to shore, root/nuke, med up, reaquire aggro from the goblin that I rooted, and pull him to shore.<br />
<br />
The spawn time is about 14 minutes. I usually have to wait 1-2 minutes for the first dead goblin to respawn.<br />
<br />
The loot consists of Ancient Coins (worthless to sell only good for a quest) and a few gp up to 4pp and change.<br />
<br />
I have never had a guard come near me when fighting on the east shore.<br />
<br />
Tip:  When targeting the goblins you have to get close enough to use F8.  Then you can swim out of targeting distance and stay in casting range.  This will get you further from the goblins and closer to shore.  Using this tip I can pull without SoW and make it to shore before being hit.(swimming skill 180+)<br />

I hate to solo, and have found that if you team up with a mage or necro you can do the tour of the roof with the 4 spawns of 2 gobos each with just a small amount of downtime.<br />
They have to be able to at least cast their L44 pet spell, other pets are torn apart in no time by these mean gobos.<br />
The great part of mage/necro is they each got a enduring breath spell (waterstones/dead man floating), I prefer the waterstones as you are not relying on your partner got mana for the dmf. Saves the swimming to the beach and still raises your skill in swimming (192).<br />
I got ALOT of xp there at 48, very few conned green to me. And 49 is not bad at all. Only 20% are green.<br />
Share the fun!<br />
