</FONT><HR>I just want to share my experiences with leveling my dwarven cleric to levels 19-24. I'm a casual player, so I can usually only play for 1-3 hours at a stretch. This had a bearing on which zones worked for me.<P>Lake of Ill Omen - In my opinion this is one of the worst zones for a cleric. Verant in their foolishness created a massive zone with  no guards. Since we clerics do not have invis or SoW, travelling in this zone is a recipe for disastor. The best experience to be had is in the Fort groups. But the fort area is extremely dangerous for a low 20's cleric to travel in. Virtually all mobs around the fort con red, so if you are aggroed and you don't have SoW you are dead. The mobs will resist root and stun and it is a long, long run the zone. If you do go here, bind yourself at the windmill and form / join groups at the undead ruins just to the west of the windmill. Power players who can stay logged on for 8 or 10 hours at a stretch will  do OK at the Fort, as once they settle into a good group the XP is great. Loot absolutely sucks also.<P>HighKeep - Goblin groups in Highkeep are relatively safe and stable XP. The problem for the casual player is getting into a group. It is a popular zone and the groups are usually full at prime time.  When you only have an hour to play, you do not want to waste 45 minutes waiting to get into a group.  Loot was OK, but not exceptional.<P>Everfrost - Mammoth groups in Everfrost seem perfect at first glance. There are usually a number of barb warriors looking for a healer, and the loot from the tusks is fantastic (8pp per). But two things made this a tough go. First, and this is only a minor problem, there are plenty of barb shamans at our level in the zone who will compete with you to be the group healer. But the big problem is the rangers. High twenties and low thirties rangers farm mammoths for the tusks.  At that level the can solo them and still get XP. I not knocking what they are doing, I'd do the same if I could. But it can make it tough for a group to make a living here.<P>South Karana - Make this your home till you hit 24. Here are the reasons why:<P>- Unlike LOIO, SK for the most part does not have wandering mobs that will aggro you. This makes it a safe zone to travel in.<P>- Relatively easy to find a group. SK has two  areas to group at. The "Aviak" city can support two groups and the "spires" can support three. In most cases I was able to get into a group within 10 or 15 minutes. At peak times the XP can be slow, but at least you usually are able to find a group.<P>- Lake Rathe Gnoll/ Undead camp<P>What a find! This camp is just inside the Lake Rathe zone when you zone from South Karana. The mobs are typically levels 15-22. <BR>They can be camped with as few as three high teens or a pair at 23/24. The spawns alternate between gnolls and undead. The XP tails off after 23, but it is still fun. Loot is good, with lot of neat things dropping from the various mobs that spawn. All-in-all one of the most fun camps I've ever done (For those under 25). <P>Because it is a fairly large camp, you frequently get multiple pulls. This gives us clerics a chance to practice our meelee skills. The undead are especially fun, as we get to take them down with expulse undead. At level 23 I grouped with a 24 wiz. We would pull the entire camp of gnolls (6) and then chain cast AoE spells to wipe them out. Not much XP  at this level from gnolls, but the new pops would be Dry  Bones (approx. level 22) which gave great XP and frequently drop FS weapons.<P>The mystifying thing here is why this place is so rarely camped. Those that give the camp  a try become addicts, but it can sometimes be difficult to get players to come down to Lake Rathe (from SK), even though the zone in only a 60 second run from the aviak city. People are sometime reluctant to try the unknown. It is quite safe, because when things go bad you are just a few steps from the SK zone. Give it a try.  You'll have lots of fun. Invite you pally friends to tank for you. This camp is tailored made for paladins and clerics!<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I haven't tried the other places you suggested, so I can't comment on those.. but I disagree with you about LOIO.<P>First... I have found it easy to avoid most of the things there, while traveling from place to place in the zone. Its a pretty wide open zone, and I can avoid things easily. Once I ran into a goblin that was high blue to me (and I was LOM), and I easily outran him back to FV.<P>I have spent nearly five complete levels at the lake and died three times. Once by the windmill, once by the goblin mines, once in the sarnak fort. (I also died once in FV when our group foolishly decided to hunt spiders there... easy if you get one at a time, but its really hard to survive since its hard to get one at a time) <P>Its a dangerous zone, as all the zones are in Kunark. However, the exp is great, plus it is so easy to find a group.. especially as a cleric. I don't think I've ever spent more then 15 minutes finding a group, which is really benefitical to me, as I also can rarely stay over three hours. <P>Definetly some cons though. Like you said.. loot isn't too great (although sometimes I get up to 3pp from a sarnak). Zones are far away depending on where you are (although the FM zone isn't that far from the fort). <BR>Also, there is only one merchant in the entire zone. My least favorite part about LOIO is going through FV. FV can be really dangerous, and although I've never died, my brother has. I've had to go to FV more times then I liked, due to the fact that I had to exchange those gold, silver, and copper into plat. And running out of reagent for symbol spells. When I went to get my level 19 spells I bought 3 stacks of them for 15pp.. haven't ran out yet!<P>Just my experience in the zone. I am itching to visit other places of Norrath so I think I will take your advice and head over to SK to finish the 19-24 stage.<P>Quotison<BR>Level 22 cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#800080" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=000048&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum10&number=10&thisthread=000048&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
