<br />
today as a level 24 cleric..  i ran out of mana against an Aviak Rook.  It had less than 80hps left..  and i had 4 bubbles of hps left  350 at least.  the rook killed me in melee before i could do 80 stupid hps of damage..    <br />
<br />
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!<br />
<br />
Clerics of D&amp;D were second only to fighters when it came to melee..  and i think that the fact that Verant has reduced a cleric to a wizard who casts postively on a party instead of offensively on the monster is a shame.  they have taken what used to be my favorite class and threw it in the toilet.<br />
<br />
normally this would not deter me from just switching classes and playing something else...  but you know what..  Verant has made a game where there is NO VARIETY!!<br />
there is only ONE way to play any class..   you have no option whatsoever..   every ranger is the same..  every cleric is the same...  every wizard is the same.    it just plain sucks..   i realize now that even if i collected every piece of equipment out there that would help me in melee..  a tank type would be 20 times better than me...   and that is not an exaggeration.   i totally feel that this game is going to fail eventually..   simply because the only thing it can do is stagnate..     i havent played every class..  but i have played a few.. and i have grouped with the ones i havent.. and really..  you cannot play effectively unless you fit into the preconcieved mold of each class that Verant has forced you into.<br />
<br />
well, i for one am done playing someone elses character.  since this game cannot allow me to play a character which adapts to my playstyle, then i am forced to find a game that can.  Sad but True. <br />
<br />
it should be noted that i do not think that clerics or any other class are way out of balance..  (well maybe rogues and druids) and i do not expect to have a character who can do everything and slay dragons at level 10..  all i ask is that i can play a cleric differently than every other cleric in the game.   is that so wrong?  <br />

Nobody said it was.<br />
<br />
Can't Verant make a game that is what THEY want it to be, and not just a copy of something else?<br />
<br />
Furthermore...<br />
<br />
You can play a cleric any way you wish to in this game.  Just because you can't play as effectively as someone that plays to the strengths that the designers have coded, well, that's YOUR problem.  Please don't discourage people from playing any class because YOU have a certain perception of how the class should be.  There may be many people out there who have their first experience in RPGs with EQ, and don't have the same conception of the cleric as you do, and you are effectively polluting their game experience with your negativity.<br />

<br />
if you dont want me to pollute new plyers with ideas of what in my OPINION is a crappy way to design a cleric...  then dont get their hopes up with clerics rock statements..<br />
<br />
I never said this was D&amp;D and i dont want it to be..  but EVERY other game i have seen portrays clerics much differently that what is here...  and to me it sully's the word to call EQ clerics, clerics..<br />
<br />
and to address the fact that you say you CAN play the cleric  in a way other than the way its been coded for..    <br />
 i challenge you to show me how..  give an example of how a cleric can hope to be effective enough to make POSITIVE PROGRESS while not being a mana battery that heals?<br />

You've missed my point.  I didn't say you could play your cleric YOUR way (whatever that is) and power-level.  What I said was, you could take the path of least resistance (and least fun, IMO) and be a walking band-aid.  To some people, this is a GREAT way to spend their in-game time.  Not to you, and arguably not to me.<br />
<br />
I never disagreed with you that the med/heal/buff routine is boring.  I never disagreed that cleric melee is pitiful.  But I will disagree in that I can play the game and make &quot;positive progress&quot; in ways other than purely statistical measurements.  I have had many interesting conversations, some exciting and humorous experiences (solo and with others), and gained a lot of intangible &quot;positive progress&quot; other than simply leveling and gaining items.<br />
<br />
You have your attitude because you bought into something that you expected to be one way (the D&amp;D cleric), and when it turned out not to be the case, you had an enormous expense that your ego won't let you recover from.  You put so much time into getting a cleric up in levels that rather than simply start over, you have to trash clerics as a whole.<br />
<br />
I admit, being a cleric has been boring sometimes.  I've got several side characters that I play, and honestly, one or two that I enjoy IMMENSELY more than my cleric at the moment, but I will never just give up on it, or try to discourage anyone else from playing one.  The beauty of the game is that you can always take a break and try something new for a while.  Sometimes it even gives you a fresh perspective on an old character.<br />

<br />
you  put a good spin on it..  and you are right..  about many things..    I think i posted this not necessarily to discourage others..  but moe to just vent to some people who i knew would listen and .. hopefully sympathize..<br />
<br />
you are right though..  i have invested alot into my cleric...  and i probably wont give him up..  I will attemp another character eventually...  but i will still play Achillean a mojority of the time..  simply..<br />
<br />
because of the friends i have made..   you are right to point out that positive progress is not only measured by gamestats..  and for this .. i am thankful to Verant..  they have made a game where i can and have made some very close friends...<br />
<br />
but..  as you also said..  i obviously dont like being a walking band aid..  and i know alot of other agree with me..  as do you (at least partially)    but what can i do about it?  other than start another character...  and end up devoting another huge investment of time..   into probably another character i will inevitably find problems with...  i guess nothing.. and because i am addicted to my friends and this game i will play on..<br />
<br />
but i just wanted to vent the fact that .. things could be much more enjoyable..  at least for me..  if the design were different..<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening.<br />

<br />
The problem with griping about the design of the game is that the chances of you gettting the one change that you feel will make the game significantly better for you is almost certainly never going to happen (no matter what that change is).  There are so many factors that go into the game that to single one tiny segment out and hope for it to change is silly... While Verant might make some significant changes to various aspects of the game, the changes they make will never be of the magnitude, or in the areas, that all players would like them to be.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about &quot;losing&quot; an investment of time in the game.  If you're thinking that way, then your real problem is that playing the game at all is a waste of your time.  You could delete all your characters and start from scratch, and not have really lost anything: you still have made some friends, you can still start a new character, and actually BENEFIT from the fact that you know some of the tricks, you know the zones, you know some strategies to use as well as avoid.  <br />
That's why it's great that you can have 8 characters on a server... and with what, 15 or 20 servers now, that means you could conceivably play every single race/class combo, and each one would be a little bit different, maybe even enough to make it worth playing.  Your wood elf druid is going to have a much different &quot;life&quot; than a halfling druid, etc.  I have yet to play a pure caster class OR a pure melee class, and I have 4 active characters and a few that were just &quot;dabbling&quot; in something.  That fact alone means that I can try two more styles of playing that I haven't even begun to explore yet, in almost 5 months of playing the game.<br />
<br />
It's easy to get discouraged.  In my case, getting through level 15 was about the most painful thing I've been through in the game.  And it doesn't get any easier from here.  But I will consider Gorgrim to be my &quot;main&quot; character for a long time, even of some of my other characters pass him up in levels, because it was the first character that I really nurtured into something.  I have a druid character on another server that I am simply power-leveling, trying to catch up to some friends that I found out had started playing a couple weeks ago.  He'll probably zip past 16 in just a couple weeks, because I learned enough from my cleric about how to build a character from the ground up.  I also have an Ogre Shaman on yet another server that I started one night when I got frustrated with Gorgrim's inability to find a group and get that last bubble in 15.  I intend to make that character a TRUE roleplaying character... something I started with Gorgrim, and just couldn't pull off.  I can't seem to imagine a dwarf cleric in my head, but my ogre shaman is very clear, how he acts and speaks.  The roleplaying is the most fun thing about that character.  In fact, in the roughly 4 hours I put into that character the night I created it, I spent about 2.5 hours just looking for the Shaman guild in Oggok, and it was hysterically FUN because of the way I roleplayed it, and I wished I could roleplay Gorgrim that way.<br />
<br />
So what I'm trying to get at is, if you're unhappy with cleric, try something else for a while, and either you will find something you really do like better, or you will get some new perspectives, and the vacation from your cleric will help you to play it again later... some of that frustration will be forgotten.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, are you one of the kinds of people who, for whatever reason, has difficulty finding a regular group?  I know that since my schedule prevents me from playing at a regular time (like every night between certain hours), I tend to play at very irregular times, and even though I've made friends, they usually out-level me rather quickly, and it makes staying with a regular group rather rough.  I think people that play in fairly static groups, especially people that know each other offline, and can easily coordinate their playing time, are less prone to this kind of disilliusionment with their characters, especially if their character is as group-oriented and group-dependent as the cleric.  Some of the more solo-oriented classes might be more appropriate for people that aren't part of a good group or guild.<br />
<br />
Personally, I've had a couple of guild experiences that left me with a sour taste in my mouth as far as guilds go.  The ones I've been in have largely been run by very self-serving officers that only use their underlings for personal gain.  I had a good friend (offline) playing a mid-high level enchantress in a guild, and she was abused so badly that I quit along with her, even though I had been treated pretty well.  She had quested, on her own (since no one from the guild would help her) for the Staff of Observer, and the moment she had it, her Guild Master showed up and demanded that she hand it over, because he &quot;needed it.&quot;  That was the first in a long line of injustices done to her, but was more than enough for me to realize that guilds aren't as nice as they're made out to be, sometimes.<br />
<br />
OK... that was a tangent... but after all, this IS the &quot;Rants&quot; forum....  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Achillean</div><div class="date">11-08-1999, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats exactly what i have planned..  i will be starting another serious character ..  so i can have something to fall back on when i get frustrated..  <br />
<br />
and yes..  i have trouble finding groups..  i went to unrest and called out one night ofr an hour that a level 24 cleric was looking for a group, not a single response...<br />
but that is besides the point..  I do play very irregular hours..  as do all my friends..  who have friends of their own that i dont know..  so even if i manage to get on at the same times as my friends..  sometimes they are just too busy for me.<br />
not to mention that i like to solo sometimes...     <br />
<br />
for a while my good friends were far above me in level..  because i had just started my cleric...  after an unsuccessful attempt at bard..      so i learned to solo... and I play alot during the off peak hours...   when they arent on..    so i Shot up in levels...   and eventually we were all in the 19-21 level range..     but since i played in off times..  and usually more than most other members in my guild..   i continued to solo..  and ended up at 25..  while they remain at 20-21..     <br />
which really doesnt stop us grouping by itself..    but the grouping is still limited by  our playing times....<br />
<br />
so ..  when i hit the brick wall of soloing a cleric at 25...  (where i am now)  it resulted in the frustration that we have been talking about now... <br />
<br />
dunno if that explains anything..   but since i dont want to play a druid (equates to jumping on the too powerful bandwagon for me)  i stick with my cleric..  and ponder over what character class to play..  since i spend most of my time solo.<br />

Levels 24-28 are not good for soloing live mobs.If you do solo live ones you have to stick to light blues/greens (ie darters).<br />
They way to avoid the med/heal boredom is to find groups/mobs where you get to do more than just heal.Also you should consider that since you have Gheal groups 4+ levels higher will take you in and thus allow you to take on new mobs or areas.At present (lvl30) i generally split my time between:-<br />
<br />
a) Treants- nuking<br />
b) Cazic - Group work<br />
c) Camping for quests<br />
d) Roleplaying<br />
e) any interesting invites (spectres cyclops etc.<br />
<br />
If you only intend to powerlevel then yes you will be stuck with heal/med.<br />

In Lower Guk you can make a big difference with a combination of healing and nuking, or even just nuking if you have another person healing. I have soloed a spectre at level 35, I think that is quite good considering the one I killed was yellow (yes, I kited it, but I still killed it and didn't use my healing abilities).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonzrick</div><div class="date">11-19-1999, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Lower Guk, I find that I am usually the only Cleric in the group.  The role I take depends on what the tanks pull into battle.<br />
<br />
If it's a solo undead froggy, then I start with a Banish Undead. At 585, that's a significant jumpstart for the party.  After that, I'll close in and melee just for the sheer fun of it and to laugh at my pathetic results.  1, miss, miss, miss, miss, 3, miss,  1, miss, 24 (big score!), 1, 14, miss, miss, miss.<br />
<br />
If it's more than one, then I usually do an ASSIST on the tank, cast Banish once, and close into melee.  I keep an eye on everyone's HP as well as my mana.  As soon as someone needs a heal, I pull back, heal, immediately sit and med.  When the first monster goes down, what I do after that depends on how well the first round went, how everyone's HP stands, and how much mana I have.<br />
<br />
If we end up with a big mob, I'll never cast Banish.  Instead, I close in to melee and let my pathetic swings add whatever they can.  I melee, and heal until I'm a 50% mana, then I pull back and med and heal.  If necessary, and mana and HP permit, and the group is really getting banged on, I'll cast a small spell to pull one of the monsters from the party and hold him so the group doesn't have him whacking away at them.<br />
<br />
It all depends on the situation and mix down there.  But I've gone through about 5 levels and have not had any deaths on my watch.  Except for the time the Monk chased a runner, and stumbled into 3 gargoyles, an evil eye, 2 bloodthirsties, and 2 frogluk casters!  Then we knew it was all over...I gated to the zone, zoned, and came back to do the res's.<br />
