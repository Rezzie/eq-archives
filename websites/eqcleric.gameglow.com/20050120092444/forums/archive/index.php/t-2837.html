  1- HILL GIANT PING PONG. required lots of Beer..Root(for yerself)...FEAR...Smallest nuke ye have...heal and invigor... Find HG Root yerself...Drink...Nuke...fear...repeat. Seeing who wins is the best fun when really really bored. I had an audience of 15 newbies watching me one time in WC, they thought I was GOD. SIGH...<br />
<br />
 2- Gobber Wall Art....Find a wall any will do. Entice any gobber to come real close to said wall. (Oooo OI OI me foots broke! I must  rest I cannae even move to defend myself) Root said Gobber in Place, stun him but good to make em stand still. Wind up yer favorite Gobber Kncoker and let fly at 'es 'ead. Invite friends over to drink and ale and make  comments on yer latest work of Art&gt;!<br />
<br />
3- If'n ye hear some dwarf be yelling &quot;FOR BEER FOR BLOOD FOR BRELLLLLLLLLLLL&quot; Look Up. And then get out of the way. Likely ye'll be under a highplace where some drunken Dwarven Cleric is attempting a Bombing Run (while tottaly bombed) while Divinely protected upon some passing gobber, orc, or ogre. We get bonus points for splash damage to surrounding mobs and witnesses...ye've been warned.<br />
<br />
And here's some pointers on the proper way to dispatch a Kunark gobber fer those interested is...<br />
 Grab their flapping toungue, Yank down, bash em with yer knee in dah face den hit em on dah back of der heads with yer Gobber Knocker.<br />
 Save dah tougues fer yer local tinker, with a piece of shark tubing and a gobber toungue they can make fun party favors....PLTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHBthahhhhplbthhhhhhhhhhh heh heh.<br />
 And yes shark tubing can be used fer sucking up the last dregs of a keg too.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Ye got any fun dwarven games ye play? Post em here. Me next chapter will be FUN WITH OGRES or FUN WITH FEAR AND FATTIES.<br />
<br />
Until then I'm off,<br />
<br />
<br />
PS-Post yer own dwarven games here.<br />

You too can enjoy this healthy exercise.  Just go the nearest doggy dungeon, go barehanded up to a dog and give it a resounding slap and the command &quot;Heel&quot; and the dog will happily follow behind nipping harmlessly at your heels.  Do this to as many doggies as you can.  Once you feel you have given the poor things enough exercise find an impressionable group of newbies, stand in front of them and give the command &quot;SIT!&quot; at the same time casting Earthquake or your own faveourite AE.  The doggies should all then fall exhausted at your feet.<br />
<br />
This can also be a good excercise for gobbos and the poor troopers in crushbone who grow weary of standing at their posts for hours on end.<br />

So I had all 8 spectres on me. Well, just fer kicks, I ran around Oasis with my &quot;squad&quot;. I got to play the part of a drill instructor.<br />
<br />
I was running backwards (thank goodness for jboots) around the inn hollering stuff like &quot;Come on you pansies, keep up&quot; &quot;Left, Right, Left, Right&quot;. I was also doing cadence chants:<br />
<br />
I don't know but I've been told<br />
Ogre flesh tastes better cold<br />
I don't know but it's been said<br />
A good Troll is a Troll thats dead.<br />
<br />
Of course, I was doing this in /shout so the whole zone got to see it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I finally got tired of playing with them, lead them back to the island and gated out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halthek Naugrim</div><div class="date">03-26-2001, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not so much a game, but it was definitely Dwarven fun.<br />
<br />
I was sitting with some friends in Emerald Jungle (ogre warrior, enchanter, and another cleric).  I was dry, but luckily the other cleric had some ale on him and passed it out.  The ogre gets himself hammered and went out to pull.  It was great fun watching him run into trees on his way out.  Because he couldn't see straight he brought back 4 friends instead of the usual one or two.  The enchanter proceeded to mez the extras while the ogre proceeded to break mez as on just about everything.  The ogre's health started to fall fast...  Here is where it gets fun.  I wasn't about to be out drunk by an ogre, so I down half a stack of ale and try to cast complete heal.  Of course I can't (next time remember: root first then drink).  The other cleric stays sober and tries to heal but it is too late; we have a dead ogre on our hands.  The other cleric and enchanter take off for the zone with all but one gorilla which remained mezzed.  I walked down to the gorilla and slapped it up side the head (I was empty handed).  I continued to try and punch while it had no problem at all making quick work of me.  Another ogre even stopped by to watch and offered to help me.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif  Anyway, I received a free trip to North Freeport where I bought more ale for everyone!  I haven't had so much fun in-game in a long time.<br />
<br />
Now for the serious question...  I played around with the root self, drink, heal routine for a while after this.  Half the time I resisted my own roots.  When I could get root to stick it was usually only for a couple of seconds.  Only once did it last long enough for a complete heal to finish casting.  How can I make this work better?  Should I use something other than root?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

1. Find a elf woman to res. Wood elf druids seem to need a res most often.<br />
1.5 Drink some good booze.<br />
2. Res them, and give them some good booze.<br />
2.5 Drink some good booze.<br />
3. Chuckle at them when one or two drinks causes weaving.<br />
3.5 Drink some good booze.<br />
4. Watch the elf closely- is the booze good enough to make them grow a beard?<br />
<br />
If not, try again later with some new booze.<br />
If so, then you've got yourself a marvel of beauty- a bearded elf. You'll be the envy of dwarves and men everywhere.<br />
<br />
I also like giving bare faced women Woven Frost Giant Beards.</div></div><hr />
