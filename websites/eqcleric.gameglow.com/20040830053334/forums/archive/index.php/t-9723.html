<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vfib</div><div class="date">11-12-1999, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Working on some Dervs in North Ro last night, I come upon 2 clerics working the undead ruins.<br />
<br />
Now they have two ghouls that they know they could not take so they ask these two newbie warriors to take one while they take the other.<br />
<br />
I was medding nearby and I suggest to the newbies that they will not surive the fight and that they all join into one group.<br />
<br />
I then tell all 4 that if they need, I will heal them as needed.<br />
<br />
The two warriors like the idea.. The two clerics tell me in no uncertain terms to mind my own buisness and to leave them along.<br />
<br />
Ok then..<br />
<br />
So the warriors ask and receive a promise from the clerics that they would get heals from as needed even though they are in two different groups.<br />
<br />
Well they start the fight.  As expected, the warriors get bet down very very fast.  I start to heal and while healing one, the other dies.<br />
<br />
Now the two clerics are actually laughing as they dump their mana into ward's vs the ghouls.<br />
<br />
The one warrior is yelling for help, so I jump in on his mob along with heals for him.<br />
<br />
Now I kill off their warrior's ghoul and now the other 2 clerics are in trouble.<br />
<br />
I have to think looong and hard about it, but in the end, I root and nuke the ghoul to save them.<br />
<br />
Then the clerics just go rolling off without a word of thanks to the surviving warrior or myself.<br />
<br />
Now, what would you do?<br />
<br />
Me, I blasted the clerics on tell and explained how you should play the game.  Now I know this sounds high and mightly but damn it they just killed one warrior, would have killed another and never even looked back.<br />
<br />
This is not how a cleric should act.  Sorry but it is wrong.<br />
<br />
So what does the cleric do, he tries to trade some PP to me.. Like that will make things better...<br />
<br />
Agrrrrr jerks.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the rant, but I think that playing a cleric is hard enough and to have folks do that just makes all of us look bad..<br />

Those are powergamers who have higher level characters who are trying to get through levels for the xp rezz's for their other characters...<br />

It's a lot of work to hit 49. Perhaps they may think that's what they're doing, but if they hit 39 they'll be a different player by then just from having had to be a healer. It takes a special breed to succeed as a cleric. I think most likely these were newbies without a clue. Powergamers would have been  smart enough to realize that a couple of tanks could be very useful for many battles to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That kind of playing style is despicable and I would've let those peices or garbage die where they stood.  Yeah two wrongs don't make a right, but it'll feel damn good anyway to see those bastards yell for help while I laugh at their soon to be rotting corpses.<br />
