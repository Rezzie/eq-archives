</FONT><HR>Is to add an item in the game that has a triggerable res.  While the players of Clerics may want the epic for their toons, the guilds want the effect, period.  Verant has repeatedly stated that they do not want our epic entering the world faster than 2/week -- I agree with Tarf when he states who cares, but that's Verant for you.<P>Here's how they should do the item:<BR>-> Put the item in Luclin or some re-vamped zone<BR>-> Make it a semi-common drop off a mob doable with one good or two ok groups<BR>-> Cleric only, no drop (got to limit the farmers)<P>It can weigh 50 pounds and require a tink bag for storage for all I care with -50 to all stats.  What guilds want is to lessen the pain of "Oops, we just screwed up."<P>Now I know there will be some who post that they don't like it because it trivializes their epic and therefore their achievement.  To them I say "bah," as new content constantly trivializes our items.  Most class epics are not the "best" items for the slots, or are situational at best.<P>Anyway, a flood (say 7 per week) would truly remove the Ragefire problem for Verant and would cut down on the traffic count of this board =P.<P>My 2 cents<BR>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>That idea would work. Bad thing is I'll bet the "revamped" PoS quest mace (the one that had charges of 49 res) has unlimited charges now (has anyone even tried to do PoS quests since the revamp?). Seems to be our luck lately.<P>I still think that a quicker and simpler solution is to make the Skyfire container NO RENT. There are horror stories already of clerics watching as some top guild kills Ragefire and holds the corpse until some lowbie twink can loot.<P>The risk of pearl loss is minimal with a no rent container (really, how long does it take to loot an item, put the pearl in and hit combine? 10 seconds?) and while you can do the "corpse trick" to keep it, it's still a deterrent as keeping a current corpse until you're high enough or finish the rest of the quest is a pain.<P>My 2cp...<P>------------------<BR>Boanerges Thundercry<BR>High Priest of Prexus<BR><A HREF="http://www.cohort.cc" TARGET=_blank>Cohort Chalybeius</A><BR>Cazic Thule Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Okay here's my objection to making the heart no rent.  First off you won't change the camp at all for anyone because 90% of the clerics on most servers post 50 have all but that part of the quest done.  <P>Second off is people like me...I basically didn't do the quest because I knew with my real life schedule I could never sit and camp ragefire.  I got married last year and this year my wife said she'd camp rage during her spring break.  It was solely a timing issue of when we could even try it.  As it was we both went bonkers as we lost sleep and held spot 24/7.  I got my container and I now have most of the rest of the quest to do.<P>I am a lvl 58 cleric and am actually sort of thankful that I won't be one of the ones that hits the pearl wall and then goes bat**** because it's such a pain in ass.  When I quest I prefer to do the bottlenecks FIRST as much as possible.  <P>Thecklos<P><BR>PS Making it norent would just make me keep a fresh corpse for a couple more days as I finish the rest up.  The real problem is a quest that can be done entirely in a day or two except this single long exhausting camp.    At this point I have burgle/chardok note/skyfire rage.  Should be done soon</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>IMO, they should limit the number of epics entering the world by another spawn that could be held solo or by 1 GOOD group/2 average groups.  This could be done at an earlier stage of the quest such as with Grimblox or even with the Sol B Ragefire.  <P>It is totally ridiculous to expect clerics to camp a spawn for upwards of 7 days and not be able to finish this part of the quest by themselves.<P>Arcangelo<BR>57 Cleric<P>PS I will not be wasting a week of my life in Skyfire knowing that bigger/stronger guilds have the ability to take the spawn whenever they want.  I just hope someone from Verant Interactive reads this and can understand the pain this presents to the cleric class.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, there are several reasons I suggest an alternative item as opposed to changing the quest:<P>1) Guild KS horror stories.  This item is not particularly desired by Clerics as much as it is for the Cleric's guild. Two per week will never satisfy the demand of the player base for a mana-free Revivisence.  Therefore, the amount of pressure on the camp is just insane.<P>2) The time issue is rather unfair to a fairly large percentage of the playerbase.  Using spawn time as the limiter as opposed to quest difficulty reduces the skill aspect and makes it an endurance contest.  And I really don't even want to touch the 5 day camping issue except to say that if I sat at my comp for 24 hours straight (much less 5 days) my wife would take the kids and leave me =).<P>3) From what I've read the problem for GMs still exists although it may be somewhat reduced.  Seems like a GM is getting involved constantly anyway.  My solution, while diluting the game (but Verant does that all the time anyway), would most definitely make life easier for Verant.<P>Rayne</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Because the cleric epic is MUCH more desired over the warrior epic. No other proc or right-click in this game compares with a mana free 96% rez. This is an item that turns 1-hour CRs into 5 minutes. The warrior epic will just allow a warrior to gain a little more aggro, it wont completely make or break a raid the cleric epic sometimes does<P>EDIT - just adding something<P>Im not saying they should make ragefire spawn more often than sev, but the situation they have right now is just unacceptable in my opinion<P>------------------<BR>Balamor<BR>60 Dwarf High Priest<BR>Soldiers of Light<BR>Fennin Ro<p>[This message has been edited by Balamor (edited 03-27-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>arge said....<BR>---------------------------------------<BR>This highlights the problem with the quest as it is now. Don't take this the wrong way (I am glad to see any cleric get their epic), but your looting a container and THEN doing the quest is a slap in the face of every cleric who has been sitting on their pearl for months or even over a year. There is a reason why quests need to be linear and I still find it astounding that Verant did something this stupid.<P>The point is that the way this is now, EVERY cleric (with a force capable of killing Ragefire) on every server is now competing for Ragefire, not just those who have done the rest of the quest.<BR>-------------------------------------------<P>You griping about people doing the quest this way as if we're doing something wrong is absolute bs.  I've never once seen somebody gripe about a ranger mq'ing a sky or hate stone (yet they aren't doing the quests as intended.)  I've never seen somebody gripe about what order ANYBODY loots an item in a quest before.  What you are saying is that if you are doing any quest the ONLY way it's "acceptable" to do is to do them in the "order verant intended".  <P>If I had wanted to finish this up before I started camping ragefire I could have (it's fairly easy and I had my duk note anyway.)  Most quests are NON linear.  The cleric epic was originally one of the most linear quests in the game (most aren't)  Is it okay for a ranger to loot the hate stone in hate if they aren't on that part of their quest yet?  <P>Don't tell me I slapped anyone in the face.  Yes this part of the quest sucks completely.  Yes it is basically an exercise in endurance which most people can't finish.  But anyone who has had their pearl for a year could have sat there for a week or a month and gotten theirs anytime if they had that endurance/drive/time/etc to do it.  The fact that they didn't is NOT my fault.  I did finally have the time to do it so I did it.<P>Then he went and said<BR>-------------------------------------------<BR>The sum total of my argument is this: clerics who have done the quest in order should not have to compete with clerics who have decided to do this step first.<BR>--------------------------------------------<P>I hope you do every other quest in the "order it was intended" (although I'd seriously doubt it.)  In fact sad to say alot of people end up doing quests because they randomly get one of the rarer items in the quest more by accident than chance and look it up and think hey I can finish that.  <P>By your logic those people should never even get that item because they are doing the quest out of order.  They should only be allowed to loot it if they ahve started the quest talked to the proper npc's and are at that stage.  <P>I'm picturing that in code (could be done but it'd be ugly.)  You can't loot that yet it's item 10 in a 20 part quest and yer only at item 5.<P>Thecklos</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>From a cleric that is sitting on the last step of this painful quest for over 6 months All I can say is this.  The Rage Camp is total BS for clerics.  I would no more give up what little vacation time I have or ask anyone in my guild to do the same thing just for an item in a game.  When RL suffers for a game there is something completly wrong.  <P>Possible fixes for IMO are as follow<P>1) Make the item useless until you can actually cast the spell or you cannot loot the heart unless you are lvl 56.  This should not be too hard since the code exists to check lvl to enter planes.<P>2) Change Ragefire camp and make it a container that forages a certain item for a lot of different zones.  You turn the pearl into the Sky Rage he gives back a container that you have to fill with 10 items that are a rare spawn all over Norrath.  So a cleric would have to spend their time running around norrath trying to fill this container.  The speed at which you can complete this portion is long but would never require you to get 12 people to sit in one spot for 4 to 6 days.  After the container is filled you then have gather forces trigger rage and kill him.<P>3) Make the cleric turn in the swirling pearl to get the triggered spawn.  Like the druid triggered Fay.  You get the item back and Triggered Fay spawns.  Then the quest is back to being linear.<P>To me an epic quest should take a long time.  Basically a uber guild can do this quest in under a week.  That is not epic ... it is you have to be in a uber guild.  <P>For the casual player epics are out of the question.  <P>my 2 CP worth<P>Todestul<BR>High Priest of Innoruuk<BR>Innoruuk server<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>The major difference between the cleric and warrior epic is that a warrior epic is easily replacable and not even among the top 20 weapons for that class, while the cleric epic has an effect that no other item in the game has, and a crucial effect at that, and is still one of the top five primary hand items for a cleric even without the effect.<P>Warrior w/o warrior epic = who cares?

</FONT><HR>Rayne, I like your idea, you have been espousing it for a long time, and I would like to get it in front of SOE somehow.<P>Here is my idea.<P>Take the cleric quest mace (the cadacus of the sacrament) and make it be the same stats as it now has, only effect resurrection or reviv.  <P>Take all these other posts that talk about other aspects of the epic and put them on another thread.  <P>Flag this thread so it is permanently on top.<P>I thinkthe epic log jam will DISAPPEAR once another item has clickable res on it.  Because guilds care about the click, not teh clerics stats.<P>Fine, keep the epic rare if you want, but downtime is NOT FUN!  Give us some more clickable res items so there is not so much contention.<P>Tarf<P>PS Rayne, I switched email accounts and lost my old account password, can it be mailed to my new email?
