<br />
I am amazed at the experience factory that has opened up in the middle of South Karana! The zone is still very empty, my group (34 warrior, 31 ranger, 31 enchanter, 28 druid, 28 magician, and myself) camped the front bedroom and controlled the entire front of the dungeon up to the double doors.<br />
<br />
This provided twelve spawns on a fifteen minute cycle, so we had literally non-stop blues, whites, and the odd yellow for hours. I made all of 29, and a bubble into the first hell level, in four hours with about 45pp in cash and Fine Steel weapons.<br />
<br />
A grand total of eight people entered the zone while we were there, and as we kept the front area completely swept of spawns they would inevitably attempt to pull beyond the double doors and train themselves out of the dungeon...<br />
<br />
We offered much advice to the people who entered, but they all wanted to rush into the cell block area and ended up doing corpse recoveries. The front is a steady, controllable, profitable area to hunt until at least 34th.<br />

Paw is great..Was having a tuff time geting into groups and getting xp before I stopped by this place.. If you can get a lvl 50 druid to power lvl you behind the doors its even better. http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif  And the gloves are cool as well..Its random drop; So any gnoll might drop these. I got 2 pair so far. Tolk me 2 weeks to get em all in the same day and went from 31 to 35 in that time as well..Nice place for any clerics really.</div></div><hr />

All Paw has gotten me is killed.  We didn't go through the double doors, but we stayed in the back room.  I got wrathed and pierced with steel...dead.  That happened about 3 times.<br />
<br />
I'll never go back there....  Maybe not never, but not atleast until I'm over 31..  Don't go there unless you have a strong group that plays together.<br />
<br />
What are the gloves?  +2 wisdom?  Hum...never?</div></div><hr />
