lets see....59th pallies get our 49th lvl res (I am still wondering how they go from revive to res instead of getting our 50% res)<br />
<br />
I am now having pallies give ME hp buffs that stack with my own, if they are gonna give pallies this wonderful benefit where's my extra AC and attack???<br />
<br />
my DD's cost too much mana<br />
<br />
and the new aggro rule.............well if I really go there I may NEVER finish this post (WTG Verant...telling cleris to be more pickie about when they heal is NOT an option)<br />
<br />
and on top of all these injustices (btw there are plenty more, but I dun wanna go there right now) a simple spell like turn the undead. I STILL dun know any of my cleric friends who have it. the 1 cool damage spell that is out there for us and no one can get their damned hands on it!<br />
<br />
I am starting to wonder what verants mission is here. Balance the classes???? they consider class balance giving pallies the &quot;cleric signature&quot; ability. we clerics have sat and watched class after class get this or that to &quot;even&quot; them out with the other classes, but what about us? <br />
<br />
yeah yeah yeah I know<br />
<br />
sit, med, stand, and hope the heal u cast dun get u slaughtered, cause they fixed some &quot;bugs&quot;. its hard enough to be a cleric as it is, but &quot;fixings&quot; and limitations being put upon us are gonna do but 1 thing. make those of us who have enjoyed being the cleric and who have dedicated their lives to being one of the most important classes when creating a group not want to play<br />
<br />
heh...here's a tell I got from a friend who's main is a 54th lvl warrior and who's secondary is a 49th cleric<br />
<br />
&quot;After the new change I don't think I have any desire to play my cleric anymore. 1 heal at what Verant &quot;considers&quot; to be the wrong time and I am dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
what a boost that was for my spirits  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
