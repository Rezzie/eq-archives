<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">03-19-2001, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, going back to VP this weekend and while I wasn't on the last trip to attempt Phara Dar this is what I heard.  The raiding force seemed to get the dragon to 70%ish life, then the AE stun goes off, then the dragon would regen to like 90% life and I'm guessing eventually just ate everybody and moved closer to the dragons next lvl.  So the few posts here indicating that Hoskar was the harder of the two, or indicating that you needed luck for Phara Dar it obviously confuses me.  We had lvl 60 people with 200+ RM and they still got stunned.  So baring some lucky streak on stuns, is there some hidden form of stopping the regen?  I'm not sure if any SK/NECRO/SHM tried any of the disease spells.  I guess I'm looking for some sort of hint or more details on what sort of &quot;luck&quot; it requires to kill this stinky dragon.  Do you try waves of tanks to keep a number of melee out of range of the AE so they run in when 1st wave of tanks is stunned?  Anyway, thanks for any hints.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Drop a disease DoT on Phara to slow down/halt the super regen. Same approach as Silverwing (back when we were doing VP with 20 people and had to worry about SW's regen).<br />

I will attempt to convey this to our raid and also try and check and see if anybody had attempted this last go at it.  I would suspect no, but I'm not sure.  Maybe next week you'll see a new post on if any new VP dragons have died on Bristlebane!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">03-26-2001, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to follow up on my post.  We did kill 5 of the 6 dragons in VP on saturday.  I 100% believe we would have killed Phara Dar too if we would have had time for a 2nd attempt.  Got it down between &quot;Ph&quot; or &quot;Pha&quot; before it got pushed up onto a pillar and then tanks couldn't hit it for several rounds and it regen'd like mad.  We killed Druushk and Nexona for the 1st time on our server.  All in all it was a fun 10ish hours or so killing the 5 of them and a very good attempt at Phara Dar leaves me confident that on the next VP run it will die.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Thistleburr for you descriptions of the dragons and which spells you used in the respective fights.  I was chain casting remedy all over the place during the phara dar fight.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
Congratulations on a good run! We encourage our tanks to fight the dragons into the center of the room, to avoid the wall crawling you described. They don't always succeed at this, but it is our goal...<br />
<br />
This weekend Phara Dar CH'd herself 5 times over the course of the fight, which made it last a while. She did cough up two Shields of the Elders, so it was worth it  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Do you fight her in the &quot;pool&quot; room?  Not sure how to describe it other then a big room with a shallow pool in the middle and a couple of ramps on either side of it, on 1 end of the room? (The ramps leading up to her lair)<br />
