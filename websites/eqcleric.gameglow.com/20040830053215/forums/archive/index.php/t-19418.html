We are looking for a couple high playtime clerics for raiding between 4pm - 12pm Eastern. <br />
<br />
We are a basically a raiding guild and we are looking for players that are on during our raiding hours (~4est-12est) 4-7 days a week. We want high play time people. If you can only play raid hours and already have 150++ aa thats fine, however if u have low AA we expect you to be on enough to work on ur aa during off raid hours. Same goes for gear ldon's/god's can and should be used to improve it during off raid hours if ur gear isnt up to par.<br />
<br />
Curent Cleric Requirements are LvL 65 preferably with MGB and some raiding experience. A great attitude and willingness to workout new scripts on our own with minimal spoiler information is a must. Elemental flagged is a BIG plus as backflagging takes much time, but we are doing backflagging for a little while longer. The more flags the more likely you will be considered.<br />
 To recap: High playtime, Elemental flagged (or VERY close to it), Great attitude. All applications are welcome and reviewed.<br />
