<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">03-19-2001, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone had success using the knockback stuns as a way to interrupt spellcasting for level 56+ mobs? I heard it suggested that the knockback factor, since it actually moves a mob, might be used to interrupt spells. Has anyone actually tried this and if so what are your results?</div></div><hr />

It's no guarantee (maybe a 50/50 chance of interruption), but it's better than nothing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salve</div><div class="date">04-06-2001, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The low level spell Stun has a better chance of sticking, and thus interrupting.  The damaging stuns like Holy Might, Force, and SoF seem to give an extra save vs. the damage itself (damage which is pretty much inconsequential to the high level mobs). Can't wait to get Stun Command in a couple of levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">04-08-2001, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Salve, you can't stun a 56+ mob. Even if you hit, it doesn't take... like trying to stun a giant. Hence the consideration of spells that move the target because moving will give a chance of interruption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kandolek</div><div class="date">04-08-2001, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you're just moving a mob, does our level 1 strike spell move them enough to be as useful as sound of force (the spell I that seems to move stuff the most).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jhihad</div><div class="date">04-09-2001, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When we were doing Paebala Rats with one group in Dragon Necropolis, I used Sound of Force and Force to help stop gaters.  Quite a few of the Paebala are unmezzable (and unsnareable), so I used high end stuns purely for the knockback.  That along with the tank bashing kept us from having mobs gate on us.  In fact a couple times where the warrior wasnt around to bash, my stuns were sufficient to stop the gater.  Its not a guaranteed thing, but it definately helps.<br />
<br />
Btw We got a couple of Paebala Fetishes, which are incredible items that go in range slot  12/25 ac7 +9wis +15 mana +5 str +5 vs ALL Resists, zero weight <br />
