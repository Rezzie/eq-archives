<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erondil</div><div class="date">12-28-1999, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Following Alliliel's suggestion, parked a low level ranger on aviak isle.  After checking since she got her Gull, finally saw him tonight!  Grabbed my cleric out of Lower Guk and ran for Freeport.  Just missed the boat, was waiting for the next one when someone else arrived on the island.  36th level ranger, Nineyards is the name.  I ask him not to attack Gull, as my cleric is on the way.  He proceeds to kill Gull.  Then he disappears -- I do a who and he's gone, I assume camped.  A few minutes later, I do another who and he's back -- he asks if I watched the battle, I say no, why torture myself?  He then claims he went linkdead before he could loot (but there was no corpse, ironically enough).  It's bad enough that we only get one chance at this stupid bird a week, but mercenaries of other classes have to kill him too?<br />
<br />
And if any of you are friends with him and can defend his actions, great -- I would love to be wrong in my suspicions; in the meantime, you can darn well guarantee that when he auctions those vambraces off I will be protesting loudly...<br />

/em sighs and adds another name to his do not res/heal list   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
EDITED:  Oh, yes -- forgot the best part of this whole fiasco... He claimed he didn't know what Gull dropped (after he claimed he didn't loot him).  Then why would he swim that far out of his way?  It's not like the island is near anything else AT ALL  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/frown.gif<br />

I'm fighting mad about hearing this. I know this joker you are talking about, too, I was camping the Unrest basement once when he begged me for a res, I did it too. Now I'm sorry I did. Grrrr....<br />

Alliliel begins to cast a spell.<br />
Erondil feels much better. (Long distance heal, my Elven Brother!)<br />

Either that or make the quests as easy to do as warrior crafted armor quests.  I would much rather see level three's running around in the armor than to see level 35+ who deserve the armor unable to get it because of other classes and their greed.<br />
<br />
My roommate has been going through similar experiences trying to get his rogue-only ravenscale armor.  So far he has lost the breastplate to the lower level friends and twinks of a cleric, a druid, and a shadowknight. *sighs*<br />
<br />
I don't really like no drop much, but I am also very tired of seeing people who deserve their class-only equipment trying time and time and again to get it (even for RL *days*) only to continously lose out to someone else who has no real need for it besides pure greed.  And it's even worse when they act like jerks about it, like what happened here with the ranger.<br />
<br />
Good luck for next time and I hope that ranger gets all the suffering and grief that is due him.</div></div><hr />

I haven't had a chance yet to park my ranger there ... but (/em snarls) that's SO wrong. Its not even like a 36th lvl will even GET exp there.  I was on that island with a guildmember who was 21st lvl.  Only SOME of the aviaks were yellow to him.  A 24th lvl druid was there trying to kill the few birds that were at most blue to him.  And if you'd asked him not to kill Gull because there was something for your cleric armor that was on him and that the cleric was on his way ... well then he can't use the excuse that he didn't know what Gull dropped.  Damn this makes me mad!<br />
