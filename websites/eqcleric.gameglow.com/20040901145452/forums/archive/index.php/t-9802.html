<br />
The other night I was sitting in NK at the stone bridge medding up. Some &quot;d00d&quot; walks up to me and tells me to SoW him. Because he was rude, I didn't feel like explaining, so I just said No. He complained so I finally broke down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can druids wear bronze armor?&quot;<br />
&quot;um, no, sorry&quot; he replied.<br />
<br />
Fine, maybe he learned something? Nope. Another halfling comes through, this one a warrior with 2 weapons, wearing bronze and steel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, can I have a SoW&quot; the guy asks again...<br />
<br />
I even get tells from people asking me for a sow because they saw me run by or or saw Halfling in the /w list. I know I'm cute, but come on  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Fortunately I've never been asked by another cleric.<br />

<br />
I have actually been asked to SoW someone after I ressurected them!<br />
<br />
Last night someone in the Rathe Mountains asked me to teleport them to West Commons. I told him &quot;Sure, go die there and I will teleport you right next to your corpse.&quot;<br />
<br />
He did not get the joke...<br />

How weird, I'm a high elven cleric.  High elves can't be druids or rangers or shamen.  I even had someone ask me to turn them into a wolf once.  The saddest thing though was a time when I was in Lower Guk and another cleric joined the group (high elven female, not that I think it makes a difference).  About a half hour later, after we'd been in a few fights, she says, &quot;Am I the only cleric here?&quot;.  I say, &quot;No, I'm a cleric.&quot;  She said, &quot;Oh, I thought you were an enchanter.&quot;  And that with me being garbed in a mithril breastplate, cleric quest greaves and carrying the caduceus and a charred guardian shield.<br />

<br />
And I'm a dwarf and have people ask for sow...though rare...but shows that there are some REALLY dumb people in the game.</div></div><hr />

The only problem is I have a human cleric in full plate and carry a mace and a charred shield all the time. Go figure.<br />
(I get mistaken for a paladin a lot though)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind you, I did ask a gnome mage for a clarity once...  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif she was in my group.<br />
<br />
Mind you, she was wearing a one of those light-blue nightgowns and was casting mes on the critters... http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll refrain from naming him - he did have the good grace to act very sheepish when I pointed out the golden armour and bloodstained tunic I was wearing   http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Equally funny is my halfling warrior friend - he sometimes uses a Bull Smasher and shield combo... enchanters keep casting clarity on him for some reason.  Guess they don't know that clerics don't wear crafted  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif<br />

   I guess people are at least checking /who before asking, though.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

Some monkey asked me for a CLARITY?<br />
<br />
I just ignored...sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best run-though joke...<br />
<br />
Practice begging to where you can get guards to give you something.  Whenever you are ruhnning though a zone quickly swerve close to a guard and hit beg witout slowing down.  The guard says something like &quot;Here Ofbac!  Take it! And Stop bothering me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Then within a minute you get 3 or 4 tells from folks asking what quest that is and what did he give me.  <br />
