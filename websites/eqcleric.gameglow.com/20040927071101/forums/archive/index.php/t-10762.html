I have noticed that a 35 cleric and 40 paladin own this area especially the bridge. I spent one 3 hour day with a cleric from my guild got him to 38 and me to 42 just with the 5 spawns for that time. On the E Marr server I have never seen more than 8 people there except when SK's or druids are after their epic weapon pieces. The spawns at that time were blue to yellow to my Paladin and red to the cleric. After making my Levels they blue to light blue. Easy to solo as a cleric or a pally if you root and Nuke. <br />
<br />
Bridge: 35-46 (experince slows at 44)Solo is doable have undead nukes and root memed<br />
<br />
stable: 40-46 (experince has not slowed down for drcobane yet here group of 4 can hold this area. pally,shaman,cleric,druid was my group and it was easy. all level 40-47) pathing gets weird here imho\<br />
<br />
Temple: 40-54 (experince must be good at this level because I see shamans soloing here and there epic drops in stable area) This area has 2 traps and very deadly pathing. a group of six is needed if you are below 50. pathing is deadly if you pull from the right and left sides of the water fall. The mobs will run if not pulled by leved puller and train the globe room from the bottom. outside spawns there are 8 plus 2 wandering mobs. All at 45 wwere blue to red if they come from globe room. Golems resisted root and broke snare 90% of the time. Decent loot Wrath bone hammer is uncommon and rare is trance stick some minor gems (durfinite and perdiots and other minor gems) pages/words and runes.<br />
<br />
INSIDE I have never been inside I have seen guild raids where they took 18 level 51 +. I know exp is good there but most are there for just the epic mobs.</div></div><hr />

I hunt the Temple now with a ranger partner.  It is not difficult to hold the area pulling from inside &amp; outside of the Temple &amp; exp is still good for us at 51.  The goo house is also not a bad area to camp.  I have noticed some strange pathing issues lately near the Temple though, since the last couple of patches.  Mobs seem to just land on you &amp; be half underground, but if you are on the side closest to the gate, it seems to be better.<br />
<br />
We use it as a place to just grind out some exp with some chance at loot.  I've never been a big fan of DL &amp; those zones.</div></div><hr />
