<br />
Would've been nice if I had been informed this before having to pass by some Spectres thinking I was safe from their harm. Needless to say that without SOW I would've been really dead that time. Just when is this crap about not telling us about changes to spells gonna stop?!?!<br />
<br />
I for one am mad that my symbol only seems to last like 5 mins on the warriors I group with.<br />

Trashed both me and the necro nicely.   Oh well...I can understand them being tough enough to see through the invis, but I don't see why they didn't deem it necessary to inform us of such changes...must not have been on the &quot;to-do&quot; list.<br />

Here's another arbitrary behavior of the spell:<br />

Why does invis to undead kill a magician's pet, which is not undead?</div></div><hr />

Checking the burned out cabin for the diary, I decided to gate out. (I had the invis spell on). An INSTANT before I gated, a zombie commander walks up right next to me. I waited for about 5 seconds, then quickly ran for the WC zone, then gated.<br />

<br />
Invis-To-Undead does NOT work on Spectres in Feerot.  They do, however, work on the ones in Oasis and OOT.  Don't know the reason why it is.  Possibly so that no low levelers can go see the nice giant portal to PoF.<br />

I am guessing its so people dont invis up and enter the portal.  They want you to clear them out, and simple as it may be for 30 people to clear em.<br />
    As for the mobs in Kithicor?  Perhaps you were to low level...I walked through just fine with invis, yeah half of em are green to me now, but nothing attacked me, just gotta stear clear of the wolves =)<br />

Invis to undead works on some and not on others .. can't quite recall which ones it didn't work on though.  But then, even in AD&amp;D the invis to undead spell didn't work on ALL undead - and you have to admit, quite a bit of this game is a great deal like AD&amp;D.<br />
