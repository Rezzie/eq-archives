<br />
Why oh why does Nagafen have to be dead to complete our quest when most of us cant kill Nagafen  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
My guild and I have worked really hard the last week to get me and the other senior cleric in my guild all the items needed for the Sprinkler.... but now we are stuck. Nagafen is up. I was about to hand in my pearl two days ago.... we were all buffed and ready and I was excited, suddenly..... ZONING PLEASE WAIT.... yup you guessed it Nagafen popped ontop of us :\ My guild does not have enough twinks to kill him. Another guild failed on their attempt later in that day and wouldnt accept my offer to help them with higher level clerical buffs and rezes. <br />
<br />
So few people want to do Nagafen now, experience seems to be more imoportant and of course Nags loot is no longer so nice since Kunark comes out. My guild has posted that anyone on my server who would like to kill Nagafen has Sol Invictus's help in anyway we can. (For example one of our Ench got the first serpent on Tribunal yesterday so she could speed of shassar everyone....) but I dont know if anyone is going to take us up on the offer.<br />
<br />
So in the meantime, I will just sit around with my pearl and my two orbs and cry. <br />
