<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quotison</div><div class="date">01-29-2002, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a level 43 cleric.. that means I have a very nice spell that gives me 50% of my experience back when I die. I have died once since 39, and I was quite pleased to get 50% of my exp back when I rezzed myself.<br />
<br />
Today, I am in Dreadlands looking for a group. Someone shouts, 'Is anyone rezzing?' Since I'm not doing anything, I shout, &quot;If you can do with a 50% rez, then I am&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't expect everyone to go crazy over my 50% rez. Its nice, but I know at high levels you lose 8 hours of experience for dying. The difference between a 50% and 90% rez can be several hours. With that said, I am not offended when my rez is refused. I even do a /who on this person to first, if the person is over 50, I usually assume that person is in need of a 90% rez.<br />
<br />
However this person says a minute later,<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking for 49+ rez&quot;<br />
<br />
I found this extremely rude. No, &quot;Thanks Quotison, but since I lost a lot of experience in Level X, I am really looking for a 90% rez, but thanks for the offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have spent 21 days playing this character to level 43. I am not a second rate cleric. If you don't want my rez, that's fine, but don't throw my rez aside as if it was useless. <br />

After you get the 90% res, people are going to scoff at your 90% and look for the 96%.  Most levels, the differance is negligable but people still insist on that 96%.  THEN once you get the 96%, people will seek you out for it.  It doesn't matter if they have a 90% resser sitting right there at FM, they will still want your 96%.<br />

You say you shouted that you could do a 50% rez, he didn't want that, so he shouted that he was looking for a 90% or better rez.<br />
<br />
Now, had you sent him a tell saying you could do a 50% rez and he either didn't reply or replied in a rude manner, then I could understand.<br />
<br />
When all I had was my 39 rez, I had many people tell me they wanted 49 or better.  I also had many people just ignore my tells saying I could rez them at 50%.  I even had one guy tell me I was stupid for offering a 50% rez when he obviously needed a higher rez.  (His body was still there the next day, so I'm hoping his rez timer had expired.)<br />

<br />
<br />
That's the rude part. In my case, the person did not respond, his next /ooc was &quot;Looking for a 49+ rez&quot; modified from just, &quot;Looking for a rez&quot;. I don't mind if my rez is refused, I do mind when someone does not appericiate that fact that I am willing to do them a favor. <br />

<br />
About 10 minutes later, a guild chanter had died, WHILE GROUPED WITH A LEVEL 50 CLERIC, and pulled me out of the camp because she wanted a level 56 rez.  I didn't find out she was grouped with the level 50 cleric until after I had done the rez, or I would have refused.<br />
<br />
Heard a story of a level 52 cleric traveling thru oot and hearing someone spam /shout with NEED 96 PERCENT REZ DUE TO BIND DEATHS.<br />
<br />
Level 52 cleric offered to come and do the rez, but the person refused.  The person finally did get her 96 percent rezzes, but only after half the corpses had poofed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">01-30-2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me is it simple enough to just state what you want in the first place.  Don't shout Looking for rez when you mean looking for 49+ rez.<br />
<br />
What are you trying to accomplish?  Perk interest of Clerics...hmmm maybe mine is good enough let me go out of my way to help this guy.  Right.  People ought to ask for what they want.<br />
<br />
When I am non anon (which is 100% of the time) and I get asked for a rez they better darn well take it.  They know my level or can figure it out.  They most likely did a /w cleric to see who could rez in the first place.  So if they send me a tell asking for a rez and then find I don't have a high enough exp% to give back to them.  They just earned a quick log on the no rez list, no group list, possible ignore list, and buff any creature they are fighting list.  I can get mad on ocassion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brenen</div><div class="date">01-30-2002, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">50% res is better then no res, but is really sucky to anyone over say 50+. I would never take a 50% res, even if it was free, unless my timer was 5 mins away or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feias</div><div class="date">01-31-2002, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I was getting 5% exp back from a rez I would take it.  Why?  Because it gives me something for nothing (if I am not charged). A rez is not something you are automatically entitled to or even deserve.  Death brings a penalty and the fact that we are able to mitigate that penalty at all is very nice.  Restoring 50% after a death for who cares what reason is opportune.  90%...excelent and 96%...next to perfect.  But anyway you count the exp it is receiving something for nothing.<br />
<br />
If I were to offer you a free Toyota Camry after your car just got wrecked would you decline it?  No way.  But if you thought there was a chance you could get a Dodge Viper instead you might hold out.  To me this is just GREED.  Take what you can get, move on, and enjoy the game.  We all want the best stuff but it isn't always going to happen and you will erk quite a few people along the way with your greed.</div></div><hr />

Fighting in Dl today when a guildie of a group member died in another group up the ridge from us. My group member asks me if I'd mind rezzing. He has know all day that I am 1 yellow etc.. away from 49 rezz. I say sure as long as he'll drag it over so I don't have to make our group wait. <br />
<br />
He drags, i rez, and he hits yes then gives me 5 peris for my trouble,  then starts yelling at me in /ooc that I conned him and what a cheap B*&amp;^H 'cuz I took the peris and it was only a 50%.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vidar</div><div class="date">02-01-2002, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't have too many problems with this when I was those levels.  The only time that stands out was once when I was doing several resses by the Ry'Gorr fort.  It was during off hours and I was the only cleric in the zone.  The only anon person in the zone was a druid (I knew this because she was standing right next to me).  There was a 35 ranger shouting for a 49+ res.  Since I couldn't do it at the time, I just kept silent.  On the other hand the 52 necromancer I ressed gave me 200pp.  I told him that was a bit excessive for only a 50% res, especially after he fed me his mana, but he insisted.  Some folks are nicer than others.<br />
<br />
Aerlin, personally, I think the one you ressed was a fool.  5 dots is reasonable for a 50% res and the next time he wants one, you probably will be 49+.  What I would do if I was you is the next time he asked me for a res would be to inform him that I don't have the Divine Ressurrection skill up and ready for him and since he made such a big deal over the last time I helped him out, I wouldn't want him to settle for anything less than a perfect res.  However, that's me and I do hold grudges.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerlin</div><div class="date">02-01-2002, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, one of my more annoying character flaws is that i hold HUGE grudges http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
He is never gettting a rez again or being allowed in my groups.  Don't care if its a raid , pick up group or whatever, it is very rude to flame someone for helping you out.<br />
<br />
Oh and if he is reading this ( I found out yesterday he actually has a low level cleric!!)<br />
<br />
I used all of your peri's on myself in Chardok yesterday and it felt GOOOOD!!!<br />
