<br />
Tired of being just another name in a large guild? Change all that and join Dawnwatchers.<br />
<br />
Who are Dawnwatchers? <br />
<br />
Dawnwatchers aims to bring together those who want to explore the content while levelling in Norrath as well as having fun, gaining experience and making a bit of loot on the side! Boring XP grind in a mad race to mid 60's is not what we are about, we like to have fun while levelling! <br />
<br />
Some things we think are important:<br />
<br />
Helping each other.<br />
Being polite to people.<br />
Playing by the rules.<br />
Gaining XP<br />
FAIR distribution of loot.<br />
Organised events.<br />
Member participation in the running of the Guild. <br />
<br />
How to contact us<br />
<br />
We welcome new members in the range of level 20-50. If you wish to join us, please register in our forums and post in the applications section giving your details.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dawnwatchers Website (http://dawnwatchers.eqloft.com/index.html) <br />
<br />
As you can see, we aren't an uber guild at all, we're just a bunch of people having fun at the low to mid end of the game so far.<br />
<br />
Some of you may already have a character on Venril Sathir, if so that's great, we'd love to hear from you. But if you don't, there is still the option of character transfer and more details on that can be found here:<br />
<br />
Character Transfer (http://www.eqloft.com/page.php?url=/uk/Account/transfert.htm) <br />
<br />
It is possible to transfer with all items and equipment to a dedicated UK server that has population at GMT hours of play.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />
