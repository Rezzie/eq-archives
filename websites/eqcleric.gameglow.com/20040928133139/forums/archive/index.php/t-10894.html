<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suiren</div><div class="date">09-14-2001, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Went on my first Naggy raid last night, only to go LD right after buffing and failed to get back on until after the raid was over. But in the time I was there, I realized just how different Naggy is from the dungeon raids I'm used to. Asked my group a lot of questions, but I'd like to know what other clerics have to say....<br />
<br />
1. What heals should I be using? I know celestial is out since it takes too long and is likely to be dispelled. What about c-heal? When should I start casting it? My group suggested using s-heal for the faster cast time, but on a 45-50ish tank with lvl 60 buffs that would barely make a dent. Raid leader, a cleric, suggested that all clerics have a group heal memmed and use it, but my group heal is REALLY lame at my lvl, barely does a thing to a caster let alone a tank. Is it worth trying to keep up with the group heal or s-heal or should I just use c-heal?<br />
2. Buffs... How many junk buffs should I have on my group, and which ones do I use? Do I put my self buff on right after the junk buffs or leave it for last? Any special order I should be getting my good buffs on in, like the most important ones last (c2 comes to mind... I'd hate to lose that), or doesn't it really matter?<br />
3. Resists. What's considered good unbuffed FR/MR for a dragon raid? Mine are currently around 50, which I was told was tolerable. What's some relatively cheap/easy to camp gear I can get to boost my resists? (around 1k in the bank, and not making money too fast) If I had to choose between wis and resists, which one is better to have (I'm no good oom, but if aoe's gona kill me anyway...)?<br />
4. Any other tips for a cleric new to this stuff?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanya</div><div class="date">09-14-2001, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Use superior heal. Complete takes too long to cast and will draw lots of agro as will group heals. Its real easy to get interrupted with fear on a complete heal too. Sup heal everyone, casters will have close to 2k hp with the right buffs too.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Most of the time there will be a buffing group that first will buff you with junk buffs. Four junk buffs is a good number. Resist poison, resist disease, ultra vision and see invis are examples of good junk buffs. After the junk is put on then they will put the real buffs on. I have seen them split and have 2 buff groups, 1 for melee and 1 for casters. For both groups you should have the highest cleric hp buff, ac buff and symbol you can get. Group resist magic from the enchanter and circle of winter from a druid should go on both casters and melee. Melee should get a Talisman from a shaman and speed buff from the enchanter. Casters should get a clarity. After each person is buffed they log out to a chat room so their the buffs won't wear off their character while others are being buffed. In chat they will assign groups and go over strategy. Everyone will log back in at once and form the groups and wait for the order to charge. As a cleric I mem divine aura and divine barrier. When the order to charge is given I pop DA and run in with my tanks. That way I am not feared or taking damage from the AOE until the time I need to heal my group. You can cancel the DA early if you need to. I then heal until oom or the dragon dies. If you get summoned early you can pop DB to give the melee time to taunt. Casters should be bound there so if they die they can mem 1 heal or nuke and run back in to help.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Try to get magic resist to 70 and fire resist to at least 80 but 100 is better. You will have to give up wisdom and ac to get these resists but you will be of more use with those resists. It doesn't do any good to have 200 wisdom if you are busy running in fear or healing yourself. Here are some good items:<br />
skull shaped barbute +10 mr<br />
plat emerald ring +10 fr each<br />
gold emerald bracer +6 fr each<br />
bracer of beetlekind +10 fr<br />
gold hematite necklace +7 fr<br />
Kunzar cloak  +10 fr<br />
dwarven ringmail tunic +8 fr +8 mr<br />
vambraces of the fervent +5 fr<br />
bloodstained mantle +10 mr<br />
shiny brass shield +10 mr<br />
charred boots +5 fr<br />

1, superior heal is about the best you can do. 10s. is a LOOOONG time to tie yourself up with a heal when you have other people you should be looking out for. Don't be shy about healing people, just because their red bar is full doesn't mean it'll be that way when you finish the cast.<br />
On the celestial front, I've found it's somewhat effective to put one on your tanks just as the charge begins (provided they don't buff to the gills), as it will give you a few seconds to anticipate where you'll have to start throwing spells first. During the fight, if the tanks are doing ok for themselves except one, you can try landing it but like you said, expect it to be dispelled soon after.<br />
<br />
2. Everyone needs 4 buffs. Use your best resists, but only the cold/poison/disease ones. Find someone else to hit them with a fourth one, as you (or someone else, a druid with Circle of Winter and chanter with Grout Resist Magic, whatever) will have to put endure fire and magic on them afterwards, towards the end of the buff cycle.<br />
Suggested resists, I believe, are resist cold, resist disease, resist poison, dead man floating, see invis, enduring breath. I'm sure there are others, just those are the most common ones.<br />
After dummy buffs, I believe come the shammy stat buffs (str/dex/sta), then cleric buffs (reso/aof/symbol) and haste, then the good/applicable resists.<br />
<br />
3. Varies with the leader. I've heard some say as low as 50-60, my experience is MR above 70 and FR above 90 pre-buffs, and others that want 100 in each. But regardless, it's an honor system...I doubt the leader is going to run around and check all 30-42 people who are there to verify their equipment.<br />
As with HP/AC, though, there is no such thing as &quot;not enough&quot;; you're better off to far exceed the target than to be below it by a few points to scrounge a point or 3 of wisdom.<br />
<br />
4. Enjoy yourself. Don't do it because people pressure you into it, do it because you wanna see the big red pollywog licking your boots.<br />
<br />
YMMV.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerie</div><div class="date">09-14-2001, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One word: lag! This is a raid - expect 30+ people crowd. Unless your computer and connection are really top of the line, expect incredible amount of both graphical and connection problems. I do the following whenever I raid:<br />
<br />
/serverfilter on<br />
particle effects are turned off<br />
PC names are turned off (use /target and /assist commands to select players instead of mouse or keyboard)<br />
clipping plane is turned down to minimum<br />
all messages (damage shield, bard songs, others attack messages, etc.) are turned off<br />
<br />
As a cleric, /serverfilter is a rather tricky issue to tinker with. It sometimes introduces a bit of lag time into playing - which, as you know, can be rather annoying against high end mobs. Of course, since it makes your connection more stable, it's something to take into consideration. Datarate.txt is another setting you should take a look at. Eventhough I am on a modem, (56k) my datarate is set at 9. Again, if you have problems with connection at high datarate, lower it down bit by bit until you find the stable number.<br />
<br />
But above all, don't get mad if you go link dead. It's inevitable in multigroup situations, like clarity fading before the pull.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/tongue.gif Just work around with settings to minimize LD, but still expect it to hit during the worst moments.</div></div><hr />

The Talisman is better and will overwrite your AoP anyway!<br />
