<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Culaine</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a 35th level cleric, and while others sometimes complain about the heal and med routine they claim to fulfill, I strongly feel that the character is what you make of it, and therefore really enjoy my life as a priest of Tunare.  If you adapt strategies depending on what you fight, then life need not be like this.<br />
<br />
My adventures of late have pretty much all concerned gathering the icons and ingots required to obtain the various armour pieces.  I have had a little success here, and am the very proud possessor of both the boots of the reliant and the greaves of the pentient.  I do however have some concerns on the validity of the quests.<br />
<br />
I fully realise that the spawns for the monsters that drop the items are controlled in such a way that you don't have every cleric on the server running around in a full suit of quest armour in 2 weeks.  <br />
<br />
I resent the fact that if I really want the next piece of the armour, I have to kill innumerable amounts of low level creatures to even have a chance of getting the beastie to spawn.  Then there is no guarantee that, having committed all this time to looking for the beast, some druid won't catch Bilge first, and then go on to tell me that they wanted the icon so they can twink their cleric (bitter experience speaks here).  Also, having completed two of the quests now, I have less experience than when I started doing the quests.  (I recieved no experience for completing either quest, and have died once).  Though on reflection, I think I see where this has come from.  I feel the designers are possibly trying to get people to focus on something else other than levelling like mad.<br />
<br />
The problem is at the moment, people ARE still racing to get their characters to level 50.  I like to think I am an polite sort and would never dream of asking one of my usual companions to join me in goblin or aviak genocide.  They wouldnt get no experience and in the 7 or so hours it takes the beast to spawn, they could have been off gathering experience points, or doing their own quests.  If the fight is no challenge, then in my opinion, it is boring.  Also from observations of the other quests, the beasties that they require to kill, spawn with amazing regularity.  Take Tarshuk in the Rathe mountains, my group killed him, and within 10 minutes he was running around again.  Take Redwind in the plains of Everfrost.  Another very frequent spawn.  Compare that to any of the mobs required for the cleric quests and you see a huge difference.  Having said this, I would hate to see the spawn times for Tarshuk or Redwind changed, as I can fully appreciate the frustration of waiting/hoping/praying that your chosen beastie will actually have the grace to spawn.<br />
<br />
I think the idea of the quests is a good one.  Personally I don't care where the new armour is equivalant to rubicite or not.  Its better than the bronze plate I have just now, better than any steel plate I could buy, and until I can get something that is better it will do just fine.  What  I would like to see is more of the quest element added and more of the camp element removed.  It seems to be that, unless I get incredibly lucky and stumble across the rare spawns as I travel (a little difficult, if thats say, in Befallen for example, and then ask yourself why on earth would a 35th level character go into Befallen, apart from to look for quest items?) then my only option is to camp them.  Possible solutions would seem to be to increase the spawn rates or provide some sort of trigger perhaps? Maybe even change the quests so they take away the camp element completely and mean that you have to gather a larger number of items from more commonly found monsters, such as the shaman quests for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zachton</div><div class="date">10-28-1999, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, heh I like the armor better than my banded and bronze as well.  though I'm gonna get another mith bracer before I waist any more time on THESE bracers.  What is anoying though is that Rangers and Shamans get more AC and better stat increaces than we do, and I REALY feel soory for Paladins... their armor is equivlent to ours and they have to go though even MORE stuff.<br />
     One anoying thing though, Babbin in Befallen.. sigh he has misspawned on me 8 times.  That is is 8 times of 8 hours running around killing everything in the zone I can lay my my expulse/mace on.  (with exception of two times coming in after server been down)  Tell me if you think that is even realistic, guy shouldn't be THAT rare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selenia</div><div class="date">10-29-1999, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree with your post that the stats on the armor is better than what I've got now (bronze and banded) and it really stinks that other classes have armor better (in AC and in wt) than ours and don't have these ridiculous spawn rates we have to deal with. <br />
If Verant ever reads this board, my vote is to increase the spawn on our items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fortissimo_Gix</div><div class="date">10-29-1999, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sat on the stump for 7 hours, maxed out my skills, brought up specialize up to 64, met at least 30 other clerics... and never got the item needed for the boots.<br />
<br />
I won't be back... no more stump watching for this girly cleric.  7 hours of sitting there casting wrath at spiders, scarabs and snakes just gets a little boring after awhile... and it's not like you can invite anyone to sit with you... they would be as bored as I was..<br />
<br />
No, the Great Stump Watch 99 will not see me in attendance again...</div></div><hr />
