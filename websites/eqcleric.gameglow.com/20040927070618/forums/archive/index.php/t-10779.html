This isn't a whole lot of time to get a group together, so I usually just go for pickup groups in the popular dungeons.<br />
<br />
Where is there to go in the new lands for a pickup group besides Karnor? (I am getting really sick of Karnor). There are lots of good zones around, but it seems like a major effort to get a group together to go to any of them.<br />

<br />
Burning Woods is short jog from Karnor. You could shout for a group there easily.<br />
<br />
Spectral Keepers in Tarkanon's Teeth are easy to solo at 50 and you could send a tell to someone in Sebilis to see if they need you.<br />
<br />
Yes, you need two keys to Sebilis and one of them needs to be in the bank. A necro can't summon your corpse if you're not in the zone and you need the outside key to get back into the zone. Corpse summoning isn't that rare there.<br />
<br />
I also enjoy fear kiting Voracious Brutes. Something about the way they run tickles me.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have been having lots of fun in Skyfire Mountains. Have a druid evac you from Karnor's, or make the hike across Burning Woods.<br />
<br />
Wurms and Mature Wurms, Wyverns and Elder Wyverns, assorted drakes and flying sperm are all good to hunt with a small group. Avoid the Chromodracs, they AoE debuff and DoT, not worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
The wyverns are giant flagged and cannot be stunned, but the wurms are stunnable. Have Abolish Poison memmed for the Elder Wyverns.<br />
<br />
The key here is Fear kiting. We get lots of strange looks when people see our lvl 42 paladin and lvl 43 ranger in the zone, but the risk is rather low if your group knows how to kite.<br />

I guess that being an evac destination one could assemble a group at Karnor and try to convince them to hunt there.<br />
