<br />
For 41(and 0 bubs) - 43(and 4 bubs) I´ve been killing Ogre Guards inside Oggok. This has given me 3/4 to 1 bub and hour and an average of 130 pp per hour.<br />
<br />
I have friends who has gotten all the way to 49 in here. At 49 you make 1/5 to 1/4 bub an hour.<br />
<br />
The advantage of hunting in there is:<br />
<br />
1st: There is a merchant that will give you good prices when in wolfform, or in DE form.<br />
<br />
2nd: You fight back to zone. no risck of dying.<br />
<br />
3rd: constant pulling with the right group. 1 tank of 43+ (warrior for CHeal, or monk for fast damage preffered), 1 Druid who is there to master loot, wolfform and pack regen/chloro), and a cleric... for optimization throw in a nice bard or another tank (bard is best since you will be fm at all time, and can almost keep the 1st half of the zone clean).<br />
<br />
4th: Only take fractionhit against ogre guards.<br />
<br />
5th: So few ppl know about this place. You will find a maximum of 7 ppl in zone at peak : )<br />
<br />
6th: The ogre guards are 12+ pp a kill : )<br />
<br />
For those of you who have allready tried to kill the guards outside Oggok (the ones in ferrott), dont mark me as insane. The guards inside are way easier.<br />
<br />
