<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shroud</div><div class="date">11-11-1999, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am writing this because I believe these changes would make Norrath a much improved place. I know that many will not agree with me on all of my points and I may be flamed for some of them. But, I think if you read all of this you will see that the majority of my subject matters are logical, well thought out, and excellent ideas. I will to try to order this properly and not wander of the topic. Be warned I said try, also that this is a rant of sorts; and is a very long one at that. And yes I will try to use paragraph breaks <br />
<br />
See there is one! OK I’m going to arrange it this way. First, I will talk about general<br />
changes; some of which will be easy changes, and others that would require countless man hours and tons of work to implement. After general changes,  I’m going to go into the class specific changes. These are what  I would like to change for certain classes. Lastly, I will talk about trade skills and revisions I would like to see made to them. So...Let's begin.<br />
<br />
GENERAL CHANGES<br />
<br />
1.) A simple change that would save many from agonizing hours of clicking. A scroll bar<br />
when buying items that would allow  you buy in quantities larger then one at a time. Ten at a time or even a hundred at a time if you so desired. This would  keep people from going insane because they have to click there precious time away.<br />
<br />
2.) Another easy  implement  I would like to see is a function that would allow you to see<br />
what people around you loot. When someone in your group loots you already get one message: “You receive xx PP  xx GP xx SP xx CP” (xx being a variable and PP = platinum  coins, GP = gold coins,  SP = silver coins, and CP = copper coins) Why not make it go further and say two messages. The new one being optional (a preference in chat filter called viewloot, with an on/off switch) for those of you that don't want it and consider it useless spam. You would get your money split:“You receive xx PP xx GP xx SP xx CP” and then the voluntary message formatted as follows: (name of looter) “John” loots (item/s looted) “A rusty dagger” from (name of corpse) “A Goblin Whelp's Corpse.” If there was nothing on the corpse you would still receive a message. It would just read: “John loots nothing from A Goblin Whelp’s Corpse.”<br />
<br />
The main reason I want this function is because later in the game, and early on in the game just not as frequently in the later levels, you just don't know if someone is lying. Once you start going to Plane of Hate, Plane of Fear, Lord Nagafen raids, or Lady<br />
Vox assaults you team up with three to eight other groups! That is eighteen to forty-eight other people some of which you don't know or by chance trust. Making  it optional would be fair since if you didn’t like it you turn it off. But, I guarantee that most people would keep it on.  Give it a range so you have to be a stone’s throw away from the corpse in order to get the message. This would end a lot of the kill stealing that happens in the Planes do to people trying to steal. Most of<br />
which you aren’t aware of since you don’t know if the corpse truly had nothing. People loot a monster and take the treasure, then lie and simply say that it didn’t have anything. How can we tell if we are being lied to? How can we trust anyone? I know for a fact that I’ve been lied to in regards to if a corpse actually had nothing because I’ve found out that a friend was lying. Someone I trusted and never had a reason to doubt. It hurts a lot of trust someone and then find out that they’ve been stealing loot from under you. This feature would end that. It would cause peace of mind and unity amongst the community since the loot stealers would be well known and disliked.<br />
                   <br />
Furthermore, you could give bards and rogues (I know this should go in  the class specific<br />
section but,  I think it's better to put it up here) a skill. Call it &quot;Conceal&quot; which if<br />
was successful people would not see what the rogue or bard looted. You would get a message like this: “John loots nothing from a Goblin Whelp’s Corpse”. When in fact they actually did loot something. However,  if they failed though you would receive a message like this: “John tries to hide looting a rusty dagger from A Goblin Whelp’s Corpse, but fails!”  I then conceive people would not want bards or rogues to loot at all then, since they wouldn't trust them; and because of this<br />
bards and rogues would not want this skill but it's just another idea. And I believe<br />
that the majority of rogues and bards would want this skill because it would be another thing they could do if they wanted to. Thus, adding to their ability to role play their character differently.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, with that many people and fighting mobs that drop impressive equipment people<br />
become unordinary selfish and loot the mobs and then lie about the loot. Lord Nagafen has been known to drop seven items. Never in any of the slayings I’ve been to has he dropped more then four; never once five, six, or seven. I smell foul play, and this would end it. Plus, it's more realistic to see what someone loots. This game let’s you take damage from falling, drown when you run out of air, consume food and water; but it doesn’t’ let you see what someone who is right next to you loots. With this enhancement the game would be much better, except for those currently lying and stealing loot. Guess they would have to become a bard or rogue.<br />
<br />
Also, now and then persons group up with people they don't know. Some tend to think<br />
since they are new they can take advantage of them and steal  for the new kid. This is why people tend to form and this clicks. Group with the same people you know and trust and never let anyone new into your group. With this view loot function more people would group up with strangers. Which would make the game easier for people who have a hard time finding a  group. It would also make the loot<br />
stealers recognizable and disliked. <br />
<br />
3.) This game is called EverQUEST? Could have fooled me! Although I truly enjoy this game; Verant really need to tweak, balance,improve, implement a lot of quests. The newly implemented Soulsek Temple quests illustrate how unbalanced some classes have it. Paladin and Cleric armor being top among the list. The Paladin armor is extremely hard to get, and the cleric armor has less AC then the Shaman armor, not to mention the fact that lots of the spawns for the cleric armor are<br />
broke. Why is it that some classes have it wonderfully easy and some have it unimaginably hard. I mean looking at the paladin quests, and then looking at the<br />
ranger stuff. I giggle it's like they don't like paladins. The journeyman boots quest<br />
is so retarded that I’d rather have it how it back the way it used to be. Yes I would<br />
rather have Najena a cesspool of hate and ignorance full of kill stealers, twinkers,<br />
and the always present @$$holes; then how the journeyman boots are now! Simply making the ancient Cyclops spawn more often (I’ve never seen him) would help. Make him spawn once a day or more randomly per zone  in Ocean of Tears,Southern Desert of Ro, and the other place he's known to spawn, I think North<br />
Karana.<br />
<br />
What’s more, I think there is a lack of Quests in the game.  It's more EverHUNT,<br />
EverCAMP, or EverMED (my personal hell ) then it is Everquest. Things they could do to lessen this is give better experience from quests. Doing the damn mail delivery all day for some good experience instead of hunting birdies all day. It would give some variety to the game. If you want to get rid of the camping issue get rid of a lot of these static (same place just clear placeholders) spawn. Make them spawn in a random placeholder now and then making it a bit challenging ,dangerous, and most importantly fair. Just cause a monsters known spawn point is camped doesn’t mean he won’t spawn down the hall sometimes to add a bit of danger to a dungeon. Now maybe the monster will  spawn more in there original spots but, give them a chance to spawn elsewhere. Instead of sitting and staring at the same wall, killing the same placeholder you could hunt in a different spot and explore, never knowing what you’ll run into. <br />
<br />
Cast a spell, meditate then repeat, casters are doomed to stare at their spellbook (until<br />
level thirty-five, good change I love it)  Constantly waiting on mana, and giving mana reports. What is with all this downtime in this game? Personally I think there needs to be hmmm maybe a quest that lets you meditate twice as fast as normal! Make the quest hard, time consuming, but also make it possible to do with some help. Don’t make it one spawn for every caster that is camped to hell. Make it different for all classes or all races. Maybe Dark Elves need to go slaughter twenty<br />
high level Elves spread all over the world (put them on a spawn time of one to two hours don’t do that damned Ancient Cyclops thing you got going) and some more stuff depending. It would make the game so much better if we aren't always sitting waiting on mana. In addition to, make it stack with clarity, oh my! think about it; you could have a full five bars in under five minutes real life time. If they even wanted you kill Lord Nagafen and return his scale along with other stuff. That is fine just make him always drop two to three scales. I guarantee people would<br />
gather in masses to take down that fekker!<br />
<br />
4.) Plane of Fear and Plane of Hate need to actually start dropping stuff. I don’t know if Verant nerfed the drop tables for these zones but, you use to clear Plane of Fear<br />
and get about two to five (sometimes more for Warriors and ShadowKnights and Monks since their drop tables are so damn high) pieces of class specific armor.With it taking so many damn people to do Plane of Fear that really wasn't enough. Now it's even worse; last time I helped clear Plane of Fear and got four total pieces of class specific armor. Four people out of sixty who are all devoting eight or more hours, and experience (considering how much you can die) all that work in order to get four pieces?!?! Thats IT?!?! WTF CHANGE THIS NOW!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
*Takes a breath*<br />
*Goes afk to get some water, and punch something*<br />
*MEEEEEOOOWWW!!!*<br />
*ACK! SNUGGLES! I'm sorry I didn't see you sitting there!*<br />
*Snuggles...Snuggles...NOOO!!!! You can't die...Your not dead...*<br />
<br />
Hehehe OK enough of that; just need to settle down that last topic pisses me off soooooo<br />
much.<br />
<br />
5.) Can I get a bind? Teleport? People are always looking for these. They have to waste<br />
their time and wait for some kind soul to offer assistance. I think there should be<br />
maybe a quest to get a bind in a town or a NPC that sells teleports and/or binds in<br />
every city. If it was a quest  make it that if you want the Freeport Teleporter (or<br />
whatever they decided to name the guy/girl that did it) wants you do to do some pretty long complicated quest, but after that he will teleport you for a minimal fee of 10pp and binds for free. If it’s just a NPC that sells teleports and  binds make it 25pp for a teleport, and 5pp for a bind.                   <br />
<br />
6.) A /consentdrag function that enables people to drag a corpse but, not to loot it.<br />
Although I have never had a problem with someone looting my corpse I only consent people I know very well. There are however people who offer to help you out and you find you’ve only been taken for the fool and all of your hard work is down the drain. <br />
<br />
7.) Another very easy implement that would help very much. Allow friend and ignore list<br />
to hold 50-100 names each. My friends list is full, that doesn’t mean I only have 20 friends though. Also if you put someone on /ignore they can not see if you are online when they do a /who all. This prevents them from seeing where you are. And if they are very mischievous going as far as going to that zone to pester you.<br />
<br />
8.) There are people who are very concerned with there weight. Monks for example need<br />
to keep their weight down in order to function well. And they have to constantly<br />
battle the copper silver and even gold coins they get. Either destroying them endlessly which gets very annoying. Or dropping them on the floor which is equally as annoying. Make a function so you can accept which coinage you wish to receive. A yes/no for every type: platinum, gold, silver, and copper. <br />
<br />
Thats about it with my general changes, let's move to class specific, I will do this one class at a time. All fourteen; I told you this was long. OK here we go, in no particular order...<br />
<br />
CLASS SPECIFIC CHANGES<br />
<br />
Shaman: Not too many changes here, although I still see a dot bug from some of their high<br />
level dots (and Necromancers too rarely) but, besides that shamans have it rather satisfactory. There new quests are pretty easy and give great gear (better then cleric stat wise and AC wise) They have great buffs, dots, and a pet.  But there is one aspect that needs to be changed. I'm just going to mention it here I will talk about it in depth in the trade skills section. You guessed right Alchemy! Never heard of  it you say? That does not surprise me it is a broken skill. How they release a broken game I do not know. And how  never mention an ETA on when it will be fixed just makes me mad, and I’m not a shaman.<br />
<br />
Enchanter: Another class that has it reasonably favorable, some changes that would make it better for enchanters is tone down the frenzy hit they get for a lot of there spells. Maybe it is meant to be like this but just seems a bit bizarre how high it is. Also I think the should further the role enchanters play on enchanting items. I will talk about this more in the trade skill section.<br />
<br />
ShadowKnights: Well I must say that sort of get the short end of a stick. There harmtouch<br />
is laughable. It has a long repop time on it, not a lot of damage, and is easily resisted. I think it should take out half of the monsters  health, and repop once a day. Not half of the monsters current health either, half of it's total health. It would get resisted by red and yellow monster fifty percent of the time. In addition, it would hardly work (say one out of a hundred times) on Lord Nagafen, Lady Vox, Cazic Thule, or Innoruk. Imagine  if it did work though; that would be remarkable. Surely something to tell your grandchildren about hehe. Generating that change would  make up for how unfortunate they have had it. They have received a positive touch with their drain series they recently got. Although I hear some ShadowKnights don’t like it or have a problem with it. It is still a step forward. In addition, they could use more swords, they need a &quot;Soulfire&quot; for them.<br />
<br />
Paladin: Well first and foremost their new armor is a kick in the face. It’s hard as hell to get and requires good faction with a lot of different factions and that you master a trade skill that isn’t that useful besides for these quests and making banded (more<br />
talk about this later). That aside paladins have it pretty good. Lay on hands is great, they have a good line of personal swords (not to mention the Fiery Avenger once it’s found. Thirty-three damage and delay with a very good proc is a lovely weapon). They could use group healing spell at 49 I think, but that is about it for them.<br />
<br />
Bard: Along with rogues maybe give you the &quot;conceal&quot; trait if they implement the &quot;view<br />
loot&quot; function. However, someone who saw a bard in action in phase four would tell you it was a sight to behold. They had a song that made them(self only) full hit (damage) and there lullaby was much better, allowing them to put eight or so monsters to sleep. Truly making them a very powerful force. Although this was a bit much, I think the nerfs they have done to bards now make them little more then a decent tank with a few good songs.  Mana song namely; sad but true. I have personally seen a good friend quit his bard due to this. I see what he means. They<br />
get a good song every six  or so levels. Everyone of their songs should be useable<br />
(some bard songs are still broke) and have an importance. They only get Fifty songs after all why only make eight of them good. Bard a jack of all trades, nah Bard the most nerfed class in all Norrath. Did Brad's wife cheat on him with a bard? Man did you guys screw  with bards. TORE THEM A NEW ONE! Put bards back how they where in phase four, with minor tweaks,  not the devastating ones you did. This would make them a more viable, entertaining, and balanced class. Making it not fun knowing your not only there because of manasong. I know fun is a hard concept to you Verant, but think about it. This is a GAME! <br />
<br />
Ranger: Need to really redo the algorithms for their dual wield, they way it is now they<br />
just aren't really dishing out lots of damage. When they should be since there<br />
defense is not  that majestic either. Make them way better with bows too I think a<br />
Ranger who has maxed archery should be critical hitting every fourth or fifth shot.<br />
Now it's once in a blue moon. Also I heard they have messed with Snare and it is not as powerful as it used to be. <br />
<br />
Cleric: Just because I am one don't think I will be unfair. Back in early phase four clerics used to have BASH! I think that should be reinstated. It really wouldn't have that much of an impact, just nice to know that your not just a magic user who can wear<br />
plate. In typical RPG's Clerics were decent fighters. Right now a wizard  with a the same damage/delay weapon can melee the same as me. Which in all honesty is not fair, I miss way too much. Not to mention that I don’t tank (defensive) as well as I think I should. No I should not have all the nice skills that a warrior has, but my dodge should cap way higher and my ability to defend myself should be almost the same, maybe a bit less, then a warrior. I have eight hundred sixteen AC more then most Warriors but, you couldn’t tell since he sucks up the damage much better then me. Other things I would like to see is the Resurrection line of spells UNNERFED! The Resurrection effects piss me off enough; now you make it so corpses can only be resurrected 2 hours after death?!?! WTF?!?!  The reason Verant did this is because people where crowding zones with bodies lagging the<br />
zone. Hmmm... how do we fix this? OK use your brain and not nerf the class for the actions of another! Make an option in video mode, call it: “See PC corpses&quot;(PC means playing character, so you would still see NPC corpses) and have an on/off switch if switched off you don't see any other PC corpses.(jut your own) WOW! We used our brain! Now wasn't that fun? Sure it was it’s fun to be fair, and not nerf constantly.<br />
<br />
Druid: The new dot nerf made druids a bit difficult to solo.  Druids are solo types; nature boys who love mushroom pads more then a nice Elven ass. Undo this, not to mention undo the resistance lots of mobs have towards there level forty-nine DD. Also, like Rangers I have heard of snare being nerfed, once again undo the nerf.  Besides that and the fact that there plane gear is a pain in the ass to get (not more so then clerics since there are usually more clerics then druids) but it's still a pain.<br />
<br />
Wizard:  Going to get right to the point, a wizard is suppose to be the master of DD. Well ice comet is nice but, what else you got? They need something better, or need their spells more mana efficient. And I hear that many wizards have resistance problems<br />
with a lot of monsters. Doing only ten percent of the damage they should be doing<br />
due to partial and even full resists sometimes. Besides this they are tolerably<br />
proficient.<br />
<br />
Magician: Pets and this goes for Necromancers as well. UNNERF the damn pets put the forty-four and forty-nine pets BACK! So what if the pet can out melee you? A level 4 pet could out melee you when you wear level 4.  Why not nerf that level 4 pet? The logic is insane all due to a bunch of high level melee types pissing and moaning cause magic users are powerful. Well in every RPG I have known, to master magic is MUCH harder to master and much more deadly then melee. And magic is  MUCH more powerful. It’s the way of the RPG world live and learn don't rewrite the rules do to a bunch of whining sissies. And I don’t see the whole pet rant thing anyhow. A pet may dish out more damage but it can’t control a fight like a good warrior can. It can’t track and pull like a ranger. It can’t feign like a monk. It can’t  save a life like a Paladin can. if they are bitching cause they suck make them better don't nerf the pets. I also think they should get new/better items<br />
to summon.  There firebolt line of spells should not miss if a line of sight is not<br />
available (someone standing in front of you) Jerks who like to stop high level Magicians from soloing stuff just need to stand in front of them when they cast and they waste loads of mana. Also they need something to fix the root bug with earth elemental.<br />
<br />
Necromancers: Wouldn't you know it a negative nerf that is not fair EVERNERF at work. what is with the new resist to their drain spells? Get rid of that put it back. And their pets too like I said above. Not to mention that I still see a DOT bug now and then.<br />
<br />
Warrior: Whine and you shall receive, the only class to have NO negative nerfs. I think<br />
they are extremely well off, maybe some minor twinks to there two handed weapons.<br />
<br />
Rogue: OUCH! I feel for you. First off give them some freaking locked doors so that skill<br />
isn't wasted. And they are needed for certain dungeons. Second make their poison skill WAY much better, it’s just too crummy now. I don’t know the specifics of how exactly the create poison and apply poison works. But I do you know you need to get pottery skill (a rather useless skill again, will  talk about later) up to make vials. Then you need to collect items to make the poison. Which is rather time consuming. Then you need to successfully make the poison. If you do then<br />
you need to apply it the weapon and it works one time. And if you move during the applying process the poison fizzles DOH! (this counts if you are hit and move too) Not really worth it to waste your time to learn. Twinks need to be made to hide/sneak making them the masters of this. Although they finally got a positive tweak dealing with the minimum damage they do with backstap, but they are still far off from being complete. Along with bards maybe give you the &quot;conceal&quot; trait if<br />
they implement the &quot;view loot&quot; function.<br />
<br />
Monk:  You guys have it very excellent, beware though I heard they are looking into<br />
nerfing your feign death! Making the monsters come back when you quit pretending to be dead. This is stupid if the monster is dummied into thinking your dead. It should do what he does when you are actually dead. Clear the agro list and walk away. GRRRRRR this will make higher level dungeons a lot more hard! <br />
<br />
Some general melee issues: Melee types complain and get positive nerfs. Melee types<br />
complain and magic-users get negative nerfs. Verant needs to stop this reward them by nerfing magic-users philosophy. It is  not helping them just hurting us; which in the end hurts them too! Make them better in melee damnit! I don't understand your reasoning in they cry we get punished.<br />
<br />
Some general magic-user issues: We need to speak up, and get the PVP twenty percent<br />
damage cut we got awhile ago taken off! Not fair how come their melee doesn't do twenty percent less damage. We get nerf after nerf they need to stop this and put us back how we were. And the only way this will happen is to speak up, We must lower ourselves to the ideals of the melee types: Scream and moan till they do something.<br />
<br />
WOW LAST SECTION! Anyone actually reading this? <br />
<br />
TRADE SKILL CHANGES<br />
<br />
On a general trade skill note. I think doing a trade skill should yield some exp. Make a<br />
large banded tunic get a tiny bit of experience. Not tons of experience but say you make ten full suits of banded. I think you should get a few splinters of experience<br />
for that. I am calling for extremely extensive reconstruction upon most of the trade skills. None of these will probably ever happen. Even if Verant liked any of these ideas the sure amount of work to create it actually happening would turn Verant<br />
off. But anyway this is what I would like to see happen to the trade skills. It would<br />
rock!<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing: Is good for what? Making banded basically. You can make items that other tradesmen need too but,  the best thing that you can make is banded. So what would I suggest them being able to do? Well this is my idea, try and keep an open mind: say your hunting in Soulsek B, and you kill a kobold and it drops &quot;A Chunk of Mithril.” With a skilled blacksmith he could then take all your Mithril and make it into Bars of Mithril. Then he would buy molds; (they could just do it so you use the ones for banded, or maybe you need to make your own or something. Or have a skilled potter make them) and with these molds and the appropriate amount of<br />
bars you could make a full set of  Mithril armor. No need to camp a spawn, just hunt kobolds or buy Mithril pieces. Although it would take time to get enough to make a full set. One if every four kobolds drop a bit of Mithril, one in every  fifteen a chuck, and once in awhile you get a brick of Mithril or maybe even a bar!. Maybe something like four bits makes a chunk, four chucks makes a brick, four bricks makes a bar. And it would be something like four bars for a breastplate, three for legs, three for helm, two for boots, vambraces, and gloves and one bar for a bracer. And even with a skilled blacksmith fails would come along. That would<br />
suck to fail on a breastplate wouldn’t it? Doing something like this would make the<br />
trade skill better so those that have devoted their time to it don’t feel ripped off. It<br />
would also lessen camping of rare spawns. Instead of camping the King for a Mithril Breastplate. collect Mithril and have a blacksmith make you one. Also, in  runnyeye the Goblins would drop black iron bits, chunks, bricks and bars rarely. You could make Black Iron Plate. It would have would some decent stats, but it would look real nice! Maybe in The Lost Temple of Cazic Thule have them drop Rubicite bits, chunks, bricks, and bars rarely  it would make a trade skill useful and the game fun. <br />
<br />
Tailoring: Right now the best thing I can think of that a tailor can make is them ten slot backpacks for my bank. They need to start being able to fashion some kick ass<br />
gear. Maybe get some Fetid Fiend skin from Plane of Fear and sew it into some real cool armor. This is just one of my ideas as above many different zones would drop different unique items that a skilled tailor could use to make it into something useful. Maybe with the help of a blacksmith to make Mithril (or Black Iron, or Rubicite if thats what was wanted) studs and make some Mithril studded leather armor. It would be great for Druids. Or need some nice light high AC armor with a<br />
bit of  fashion monks? How about some Rubicite Reinforced Leather  for example.<br />
The possibilities are endless, right now this is a skill that is nice to have, but not<br />
really anything big about it. One more for you: Sanmaihns in Plane of Fear drop a type of  hay, how about if a skilled tailor could weave this into some nice armor? or maybe make a backpack out of it? It’s up the imagination where they would go from here.<br />
<br />
Pottery: Once again a skill that is basically not worth it, make it have some application,<br />
some high level purpose, practical and important. Since Verant can’t come up with<br />
any ideas; I have a few.  What do I have in mind? Hmmm maybe with a QUEST a skilled potter could make an &quot;Everfull Jug of Water.&quot; Never have to buy water again? I’m sure lots of people would take up pottery then. Or an “Everfull Pot of Food.” These things would be hard to get, and require a skilled potter. But they would be well worth it. you don't need to go buy water. They could do the same<br />
thing with bandages...maybe not everfull but a lightweight container with 20 slots that will only hold bandages? Good idea huh? <br />
<br />
Archery: This skill is probably the best off, there should be some items that need the help<br />
of other trades maybe a crossbow (real slow delay but LOTS of damage; maybe something like forty damage 200 delay) that requires the help of a very skilled tinker. exploding arrows that have a proc that need the help of a skilled tinker. Maybe with the help of a skilled Rogue they could make poison tip arrows. (if they fix that part of the rogue and let items hold poison charges) Just some ideas.<br />
<br />
Alchemy: I will admit I don’t know much about this skill. But, this is how I imagine it. Say you want sow? Buy a potion from a Shaman that has 30 charges of sow. Might cost ya a bit; say thirty plat for a potion of sow with thirty charges is only one platinum per sow; not that bad. Now if only it wasn't broke. Furthermore with assistance of other classes, I think shamans should be able to make potions and have other classes “bless” it with a spell. Say a Cleric helps a shaman make a nice Resurrection potion. Shaman makes a potion, then the cleric casts Resurrection on it and it gets one charge of Resurrection; they would sell good. Shaman and  Wizard get together, make a nice one charge potion of Teleport to Greater Faydark. Nice to have if you get into a jam. <br />
<br />
Tinkering: It's coming along rather well now just need new items. I would like an item that makes me float. Or maybe an item that castes invisibility? No I got it my best idea! A item that has one charge of Spirit of the Cheetah (Super fast sow for thirty<br />
seconds) Rocket Backpack! Mwahaha!<br />
<br />
Jewelry: This is currently probably the best skill to master. You can make lots of money if your good at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shroud</div><div class="date">11-11-1999, 12:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But, we need some more gems. Some quests for gems that give some nice  results would be a nice combo.<br />
Or perhaps rare drops off of one of the dragons, or one of the gods that give super good stats. Would stink<br />
if you failed but just for example say you kill Innoruk and get a “Titans Gem.” Find a Jewelsmith, cross<br />
your fingers and viola a plus fifty strength ring! How cool would that be? Verants main problem is they<br />
don’t expand. They need to make jewelcraft quests, and more gems, maybe rare metals to combine with<br />
gems too. The possibilities are only limited by their creativity. They aren’t being to creative.<br />
<br />
Enchanting: A skill that is suppose to be coming. It would allow Enchanters to enchant items besides<br />
jewelry. This is how I imagine it. The new trade skill would be called enchanting. It would be available<br />
only to Enchanters. They would get a new spell called “Enchant.” Maybe to get this new spell they have to<br />
do some detailed quest. However once that got it,  say you want a combine dagger? Buy a store bought one<br />
and an Enchanter enchants it and it's now combine. This is pretty useless item just using it as an example.<br />
Here I’ll use a one that could apply to something someone wants. You want to add some agility to your<br />
store bought plate? Find an Enchanter willing to help, this enchanter must have the Enchant spell, and<br />
another item called “An Enchanting Box,” (maybe another quest, or a high level pottery quest to get it, it<br />
would have unlimited uses, would be a box with two slots and a combine button at the bottom) Then you <br />
would need a scroll of the spell you wanted it to be enchanted with. So you get the spell  “Agility” from a<br />
Shaman vendor. The Enchanter then casts Enchant on the Steel Breastplate. Now at this point the<br />
Enchant can hold (that is what you want it to do) turning it into a Combine Steel Breastplate. (same stats,<br />
maybe a bit better) OK, some things you should know about the spell Enchant: it has a reagent which is a<br />
ruby, it’s also a VERY long spell, say two minutes long (real life time) if you fizzle or get interrupted the<br />
reagent isn’t used. But, if the enchant doesn’t hold, there would be no harm your breastplate but it eats up<br />
a reagent. Or, it can fail enchantment and incinerate your Breastplate (OUCH!) when this happens you<br />
lose the reagent and the item. Now if your enchantment takes hold (fifty percent chance) then you put it in<br />
the “Enchanting box” with the scroll and hit  combine. Now here it can go two ways. It can “take good” or<br />
it can “take bad” if it takes good  you know have an “Agility Enchanted Combine Steel Breastplate” with<br />
a rather large agility increment or you can have it take bad when you get an “Agility Cursed Combine<br />
Steel Breastplate” with this one the agility is negative. Any item can have an enchantment put on it. Say<br />
you have a Mithril Breastplate and want to add more agility to it? Sure! But if the item already  has stat<br />
buffs then both success tables are reduced. Both enchanting the item itself and combining it in the box.<br />
Since the Mithril Breastplate already has one stat buff your chances of enchanting it are now twenty-five<br />
percent chance. Thats one in four of success. Say you get it to hold and want to risk a third enchantment.<br />
A third stat increase has a chance of five percent. Which is basically not worth it. You have to buy the<br />
ruby, supply the already rare two enchanted item, and the spell you wish it to be enchanted with. If a three<br />
enchanted item was created it would be amazing! Sick of buying sow potions?  ask an Enchanter (skilled)<br />
to enchant  your boots with SOW! Since sow isn’t a stat buff it has restrictions one of the restriction is that<br />
it can only be placed on shoes. Another of the requirements is you need to provide Journeyman boots, not<br />
a scroll of Speed of the Wolf. Which would make failing SUCK! But if you where up to it and got a<br />
success you would have sow  whenever you wore them boots. To prevent enchanters from ripping people<br />
off you would get a spell message (if you had your spells options on all) of what is going on. John begins<br />
casting a spell (two minutes later) John tries to enchant a Mithril Breastplate but Fails! The Mithril<br />
Breastplate incinerates( the ruby would be used with this scenario). Or, John begins casting (two minutes<br />
later) John tries to enchant a Mithril Breastplate but the spell doesn’t’ take hold .(just ruby burned up not<br />
Mithril Breastplate. Last example the spell takes hold, John begins casting (two minutes later) John<br />
enchants a Mithril Breastplate. Now after this John would still have to try to combine it in the<br />
“Enchanters Box.” And you would receive similar messages for success and failures. John Enchants a<br />
Combine Mithril Breastplate with Agility.  Or, John Curses a Combine Mithril Breastplate with Agility. <br />
<br />
Well this is my rant, I think overall all I have to say is my changes would make this game something<br />
Verant is afraid of for some reason. <br />
<br />
FUN! <br />
<br />
No animals where hurt in the typing of this rant!</div></div><hr />

<br />
   Read your whole post, in case you were curious if anyone had.  Too bad you aren't an IMP for EQ.  Kinda wonder where they found the folks that do it now...<br />
<br />
Anyways, I bet they would hold off all such changes for the EQ2 Super Patch that costs $50, so you would spend your money on it....<br />
Actually I seriously doubt that anyone at Verant even goes to cleric sites and reads rants...  they seem to be all elf ranger types...</div></div><hr />
