<br />
If you can get a party of 4 to 6, you can camp the Goblin Warlord room, they spawn a little slow, about every 25 mins, but you pick up heaps of Black Iron Medallions, Black Iron Boots and Gloves and even the occasional Black Iron Crown.  Besides, it takes a Level 22 Wizzy 10 mins to get all his mana back.  http://www.kmrcs.com/eqcleric/ultbbs/ubb/smile.gif.  The delay between spawns doesn’t seem that long when your there.<br />
<br />
In the Warlord room is the Warlord (Level 23-25) and two Goblin Elite Guards (level 18-20).  They bang a group of four around quite a bit, but it’s nothing a good Cleric can’t control.  Have root or Holy Might ready as when they get to 2 bubbles of life they run for help.  While we never let one get out of the room, I think your death would be fast and violent should they run to the king.<br />
<br />
In a party of four, I made 180pp and 2 bubbles of XP in 4 hours.  While the XP is slow vs SK and Lake Rathe, the money is great and goes a long way towards getting those Level 24 spells.<br />
<br />
Also I suggest, that while there, you bid for the Icon of constant off Scurge.  While the chances of him popping up aren’t good, you may as well see if someone level 30+ player beating on the Goblin King can’t get you one step closer to the Chest-plate, and it saves you from having to camp the room later in life.<br />
<br />
Good Luck<br />

Good place to a BIM if you don't have it yet. Got mine on the second slaying of the Warlord. Also, a note, if the Warlord gets boring, just get a full group of 6, 19-23, and head over to the Knight room for some BIBS.  The tanks in the group will love you for it if they need better 2h'rs.<br />
Also, the Knight room provides more consistent fighting...just be sure to stay towards the wall where you come in, b/c going further pulls, EEs and Dazeds who don't want to mess with.</div></div><hr />

A lesson learned in Runnyeye this past weekend, for those who did not know...<br />
<br />
The Knight room is just past the Green and Purple crystal rooms near the water. If you follow along the water, you will come to a fireplace with two Dazed Guards. To the left of the fireplace are two bedrooms containing multiple Dazed Shaman and Guards. The fireplace guards are independant, but the bedrooms are linked.<br />
<br />
We did not know this, and the resulting train killed everyone between there and the gorge -- No survivors, just eighteen bodies in a massive heap at the zone line.<br />
<br />
I felt so bad.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yengoi</div><div class="date">02-23-2001, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been hunting in Runnyeye for several levels and it is great exp. I am now level 22 and grouped with a level 23 paladin last night, I got 8 blue bubbles in 2 hours. Hard to beat that. In a small group (or solo for the daring) you can pull goblins from the pool room (turn right from the entering from the Gorge, down the ramp, right at the door, and then straight to the pool room). Zap a gob to get its attention and run towards the gorge zone. If you are solo and pull more than one (first pull may be up to six if you pull the knight room) or in a duo and pull more than two, zone to the gorge then back again as soon as all the party makes it across. This will dis-aggro the mobs and they will start heading back to the pool. One will often hang back and you can run up and hit it and then pull it back towards the zone to fight. Paladin only used lay-hands once and that was because the wandering Warlord (there is one in a room and one wanderer) walked by and he couldn't resist chasing it down even though we had just finished killing 2 gobs.<br />
I first camped the warlord at level 19. I was with a level 20 rogue and a level 22 fighter. This was the minimum sized group to do it. At this level it is very dangerous (everyone was less than 1 bubble after the fight) and everyone must know their part. Much easier with 4 level 19 to 22 except then gets a little boring if only doing the warlord room.<br />
Camping in the warlord room is safe and you can med w/o interruption. Just stay by the back wall so out of range of wandering mobs outside the room.<br />
