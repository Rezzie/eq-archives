<br />
Needless to say, I won 100pp, for being in 3rd place, for the 4th picture.  All the rest are uh, pretty cool.<br />

<br />
Aaah.. Dalur.  Spending too much time in Butcherblock are we?  You should visit Nektulos more often  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I don't even know these people that were at the competition.  It wasn't only for Xegony either- it was a game-wide server-type thingy.  It was VERY small too, maybe 12 participants.<br />
<br />
A warrior won first place for a picture of him sitting down and levitating in a VERY scenic part of Kunark.  I don't know where it was, but if my eyes served me correctly, it was the Emerald Jungle, just before entering the ruins of Mist.<br />
<br />
The way he sat, made it look like he was a caster meditating in mid-air.  Perfect race to use it too.  The barbarians look so cool when they sit down in air, it really sord'a looks like they're concentrating heavily.  He got 500pp.<br />
<br />
There was an Enchanter that got 2nd place, but I never saw their screenshot.  I dunno.  I guess I just missed out.  She was awarded 250pp<br />
<br />
And of course, moi, I got 100pp.  AT least it's enough to buy me Jaspers  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
