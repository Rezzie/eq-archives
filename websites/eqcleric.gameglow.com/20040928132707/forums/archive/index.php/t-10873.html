<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">06-08-2001, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a growing guild of level 49-60 players, well balanced, most in the 54-55 range. We've gone to PoH probably 20 times now and have put most members in nearly full suits, and have also successfully cleared parts of the second floor. We've done PoF a couple of times and are doing our 3rd on Sunday (all without Draco or CT up) and have made decent progress in outfitting those classes as well. We were able to complete island 3 - azarack isle - in PoS.<br />
<br />
Other achievements so far include making epics for a pair of monks and a druid, and are about to complete our first shaman epic as well. We're also close to a couple of ranger and enchanter epics. We've killed VS on our first and only try so far, and easily annihilated Faydaedar while doing the druid epic. We've killed all the fear plane golems twice. We were also able to kill Nortlav the Scalekeeper with about 17 people.<br />
<br />
We've done all this in about 2 months since the guild was formed, at which time the best we could do was kill Phinigel - so we've been making good progress so far.<br />
<br />
We're about to do our first PoG raid, get our second chance at VS, and soon we will do Severilous as well.<br />
<br />
Our strengths:<br />
-3 excellent monks levels 60, 58 and 54, all with epics<br />
-3 level 60 clerics, 1 57 cleric, and 8 clerics level 51-53<br />
-about 12 total level 55+ players including a SK, a ranger, 3 warriors, 3 enchanters, and a shaman<br />
-players are all skilled at their classes and work together well in raid situations, listen to and follow instructions well<br />
-a few senior and experienced people who know how to run raids well and successfully<br />
<br />
Our weaknesses:<br />
- lack of very high level warriors (we borrow often)<br />
- generally insufficient resist gear<br />
- serious lack of bards and magicians (again we borrow)<br />
- little raid experience for most of the guild members outside of the past two months<br />
<br />
<br />
Also as a FYI we are giant-aligned although we do have some people with good dragon and dorf faction.<br />
<br />
Okay now that I've given all the background info, my question is: Where do we go from here? Is the progression from here (VS/Sev/PoG/2nd floor Hate) -&gt; (Trak/PoS/PoG bosses/Draco/Innoruuk) -&gt; Western Wastes/VP -&gt; ToV/Cazic/Dain/Velk -&gt; Sleepers Tomb? What other places can I take these folks where they will have fun, a good challenge, and be able to upgrade their gear enough to be ready for the next step? Do I have any steps out of order? Which ones should we do first to be able to progress the fastest and have the most experiences in the time left that we are playing the game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd recomend camping ToV or Keal for quest armors.   Its a lot less stressful than PoG in most guilds.  PoG has issues with people trying to stay non-kos but still wanting to help the guild and/or get loots.   <br />
<br />
Western Wastes is also good, but can be very frustrating for any class that has buffs.  Almost every dragon in the zone has Vox or Nagafen disspell breaths.   Some have Chaosflux so keep DMF up!<br />
<br />
Dragon Necropolis is another great place to get some fairly nice items and the breastplate gems you will need if your doing Thurg/Keal/SS armor quests.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derenath</div><div class="date">06-09-2001, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also Lord Dojo and the named Golems in Velks would be about right for your guilds level. Western Wastes also for the nesting dragons. Gating ones might give you trouble.<br />
<br />
And of course epics for your clerics. The King in Chardok and Ixiblat can offer some decent melee gear.<br />

<br />
VP should possibly be a &quot;tentative&quot; goal as acquiring even 24 keys is a difficult task.<br />
<br />
Your Monks would *love* do you do Lord Dojo in Velks.  He can be done with as few as 12 but I recommend taking 24 or so for your first try.  He drops some nice Monk gear.  25ac 0.5wt tunic, 25ac 0.0wt turban, etc  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malathor</div><div class="date">06-12-2001, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Based on that list your should certainly be able to hunt in WW, start exploring DN, and take down Lord Dojo and Chard King right now. The next mobs to try are Dracholiche, Chard Queen and Sev. If you can take them down its time to move on to the following list:<br />
<br />
Trak<br />
Talendor<br />
Wuoshi<br />
PoS (Spiroc Isle)<br />
Vaniki<br />
ToV farming<br />
<br />
Moving past this list to some of the early &quot;uber&quot; mobs like Klandicar and Vindicator is gonna take some high level Warriors. Getting some and equiping them should be your number 1 priority.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">06-18-2001, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, if i'm getting this straight you have about 20 members 55+ atm. I would recommend getting 10 more 55+ asap. Use invites until you have a solid 45 or so 55+ players that will attend raids regularly. At least at first you will need numbers to make up what you lack in equipment/tactics.<br />
<br />
First I would recommend going with +Dragon Faction in SOV, its alot easier than +Giant, and it allows you to take advantage of the new SS quest items in addition to the sick TOV quest items(eventually).<br />
<br />
1. Practice Dragon technique on Sev, Trak, Talendor (wont hurt your Claws of Veeshan faction and are relatively easy).<br />
2. Kill in Kael Arena for Thurg quest armor for your lowbies AND to build +CoV faction.<br />
2.5 PoG armor is about the same as Thurg armor but drop rates suck really hard...not really worth it and will just bog you down.<br />
3. Kill in Halls of Testing in TOV for your 55+ ppl to get nice SS quest armor (resists/stats will go up quite abit from this armor).<br />
4. Fight in DN for ridiculous EXP and some decent items (willsapper, PSC etc) and make it your goal to take out Zlandicar eventually. He's got some nice drops and you can get ST keys too.<br />
5. Once your COV faction is high enough, kill Klandicar too for more ST keys.<br />
6. Kill Dojo, Velketor, Vindicator, Dracoliche and forget about VP. A. you need mass Trak killings to even get the keys B. It would take you FOREVER to get to the point where you can kill Phara Dar. (unless you wanna just kill SW and Hosh Xygoz and split)<br />
7. Try to get as many Warrior and Cleric Epics as possible.<br />
8. Once your ranks have swelled abit, and you can consistently take down Vindicator, Velketor, Trak etc. *Add* Dain, CT, and Dozekar to your To Do list and practice each one exclusively till you can keel em reliably. <br />
<br />
There you have it. If you use this plan as a rough guide and pursue it aggressively with serious commitment from guild members you might be able to do all this in the next 8mo.<br />
You should have 60+ active members by then if you REALLY want to cook with fire.<br />
80+ if zerg is the name of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seolta</div><div class="date">06-18-2001, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">grrrrr really need edit capability :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jubal</div><div class="date">07-19-2001, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok this is what we've done to this point - as a general FYI all the dragons and major spawns on Torv are on a rotation so all the guilds that can do them get a shot in turn without fighting over them:<br />
<br />
1) Went +CoV faction (changing was a bitch but doable) since 2/3 of our new recruits wanted +CoV<br />
<br />
2) Lost to Trak on 2 tries our first go because we didn't get the pulls right (Trak on bridge, Trak in water ecch). We figured out enough that we can do it our next shot though. Even when he was on the bridge we got him down to 60% fast before he fell in the water so we know if we get to actually engage him in open combat, he's toast.<br />
<br />
3) Been practicing our dragon technique on Faydaedar, making a bunch of easy druid epics. Last go 30 folks only corpse was named Faydaedar =) Pretty confident we can nail Sev again on our next turn.<br />
<br />
4) Been killing in Kael Arena and avoiding PoG. Not happy at all about the drop rates though, we've gotten one piece of plate in 3 raids and it came from a mob by the WL zone. Most of the stuff in the arena drops chain. Where the plate drops, I got no idea. We did get some cool weapons though including 3x Defiance and that nice 20/30 bow. Killed a few mobs in the Tormax area as well including one that gave +Dain +Yelinak faction hits.<br />
<br />
5) Got ourselves on the list for Ragefire, prepared now to make 5 cleric epics as soon as our turns come up. Sadly the list for this one is long =( Working on warrior epics but the green scale is a major bottleneck and largely depends on the Sev rotation (which isn't all that bad really, we get one of four Sevs)<br />
<br />
6) Teamed with one guild to kill CT and another to kill Velketor. Velketor is going to turn out to be a regular event it looks between our guild and the other. Nice for casters to get something finally.<br />
<br />
7) Killed Dracoliche on our own! Nice belt I got too.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also fixed our major problem and recruited a bunch of warriors and clad them all in indocolite, leaving us with 10 55+ warriors and one who is 60th.<br />
<br />
Plan from here is to do VS, Sev, Trak, Draco as many times as we can get to them, plus the combo run on Velk on a regular basis. Soon I hope to be able to do Velk alone. Getting everyone on strong +CoV faction now so soon HoT will be open to us and we'll fight a bit there. Zerg is definitely not the name of the game; we've gotten the nickname 'the ghetto guild' from the ubers since we do things that only people who are much much better equipped can match. We do SG, DN and Velk's Lab in xp groups mostly these days, but one day I plan on taking a raid-sized force to clean out DN and the boss in SG. VP will have to wait; by the time we get enough keys we'll probably be able to waltz right through at the rate our power is growing.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering now is how tough Vindicator is compared to the stuff we've been fighting and whether he's a reasonable near-term target... perhaps Zlandicar as well or Klandicar (now that I know how easy it is to get +CoV faction back).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delheru</div><div class="date">07-19-2001, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vindi is relatively hard until you get the knack of it, then it becomes a total wuss all of a sudden. Numbers don't mean very much with him, you can kill it with 24 if you have to (ok admittedly need good equip for this), and never should need more than 36. Your warriors might not be able to stand up to him very well though, if they're still wearing indicolite that is... I'd go to halls of testing the second you have sufficient faction if I were you. Seriously that place is EASY, 6man with excellent gear can hunt there np sO I have no doubts 18 people with not-so good gear can as well. ToV might sound like a scary sound, but until you go to the north wing it isn't  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">electrae</div><div class="date">07-23-2001, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For resist gear we have a program.  All blue diamonds and diamonds on raids go to our guild jeweler who makes resist gear and hands it out to folks 50+.  It got our guild jeweler from 200 to 250 in Jewelcrafting and it got us well equipped.  The person getting the jewelry supplies the metal or money to cover it.<br />
<br />
Start working on tactics.  You will need them for the tougher mobs.<br />
