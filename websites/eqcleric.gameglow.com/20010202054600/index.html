<blockquote>
January 9th, 3:00am<br>------------------------------<br><br>***Patch Day***<br><br>We're happy to present today's patch, which focuses primarily on addressing issues that have been brought forth by EverQuest players.  We appreciate the opportunity to spend some time focusing on specific issues important to you.  Today's patch includes the following:<br><br>*Disciplines*<ul><br><li>The "Resistant" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 1.</li><br><li> The "Holy Forge" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the previous 2.</li><br><li> The "Weaponshield" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.</li><br><li> The "Leechcurse" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the previous 15.</li><br><li> The "Deftdance" Discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.</li><br><li> The "Puretone" Discipline now lasts 4 minutes instead of the previous 2.</li><br><li> The "Sanctification" discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the previous 10.</li><br><li> The "Unholy Aura" Discipline now gives a 50% bonus to Harmtouch (compared with the previous 25%) and causes it to save versus disease, which should result in even fewer resists in most high-level encounters.</li></ul><br><br>*Spells*<ul><br><li> "Lay on Hands" has been improved starting at 40th level.</li><br><li> The "Summon Corpse" spell is now available to Shadowknights.</li><br><li> Corrected a bug that was causing damage while using the "Trueshot" Discipline to be the same regardless of the quality of your bow.</li><br><li> The spells "Focus of Spirit" and "Visions of Grandeur" now stack.</li><br><li> "Harmtouch" is now resisted as if it were a "Lifetap" spell, meaning that it is all-or-nothing, and nearly unresistable with exception to encounters that are immune to magic or out of the acceptable level range.  In addition, maximum damage for Harmtouch has been increased starting at 40th level.</li><br><li> We fixed a bug that caused "Lure" type spells (Wizards) to be resisted more than they should have been in certain types of encounters.</li><br><li> Melee attack timers will no longer be reset when a SK, Paladin, or Ranger cast a spell.  Previously these classes had to wait a full attack delay after casting before they would attack via melee again. </li></ul><br><br>*Miscellaneous*<ul><br><br><li> You may now adjust the clipping plane in the Hole.  Previously, the clipping plane was fixed.  Many people requested the ability to bring the clipping plane closer to allow them to improve their client's performance.</li><br><li> Fixed several problems with trade-skill components that were not dropping.  Also added some new recipes.</li><br><li> Fixed the Iksar "Shackle of Steel" quest.  </li><br><li> The additional options for /camp (/camp server, /camp desktop) have been implemented.  /camp server will take you to the server-selection screen.  /camp desktop will cause EverQuest to terminate and take you to the desktop.</li></ul><br><br>*Root and Snare*<br><br>Root-type spells and "snare" type spells now use a separate spell effect.  <br><br>Previously, "Root" spells would overwrite any snare effect upon the target.  When the root would wear off, the target began moving at full speed.  With this change, when root wears off, snare will still be in effect.  This has a few added effects on the other end.  <br><br>For instance, root will no longer cancel SoW or Journeyman's Boots effects.  It also allowed us to correct a long-standing bug that was allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's Accelerando if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was rooted.  As mentioned in a previous patch where the first part of this bug was fixed, this was not the intended effect.<br><br>*Looting NODROP Items*<br><br>A new command is now available to EverQuest players.  <br><br>In order to prevent the accidental looting of NODROP items, the /lootnodrop command has been added to the client.  The command supports three options:  ALWAYS (Default) - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP item.  SOMETIMES - You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP items that your race and/or class cannot use.  NEVER - NODROP items will be looted without confirmation. <br><br>It is highly recommended that you DO NOT CHANGE this from the default option, as the GM staff cannot assist in cases of accidental looting.<br><br><br>- The EverQuest Team</blockquote></p>

Also addressed were problems with targeting, enabling and disabling<br>windows, and switching to and from resolutions above 1280x1024.</li><br><li>Corrected a problem that would cause some Voodoo card users to lock up when killing giants.</li> <br><li>Added messages for some new skills that some NPCs have (e.g. Rampage, and Flurry). </li><br></li>Fixed items and item drops in a number of zones.</li></ul><br><br>Enjoy your weekend!<br><br>                          - The EverQuest Team<br>                           </blockquote></p>

PATCH MESSAGE, DECEMBER 7, 2000<br><br>Today's patch addresses a few issues brought up by players over the last several days:<ul><li>Fixed an issue with /split that would cause people to go linkdead in the event that they used the command in quick succession.</li> <br><li>Fixed a bug where you could not edit socials or skills (via the hot button window right click) in fullview mode if you had hidden your "MainMenu" window.</li> <br><li>Fixed a bug where you would not see hotbuttons in "normal" mode if you had hidden that window in fullview mode.</li> <br><li>Fixed it so you can't use hotbuttons when looting, trading, banking, or using a merchant in fullview mode (which is how it is in normal mode, but with the inventory working in fullview mode now it wasn't blocked properly for that).</li> <br><li>Fixed the message for the /dynamiclights command to report properly. </li><li>Fixed a problem where INI setting were not being read properly if you had camped or went LD to server select then reentered the game. This was causing various UI problems with window positions and colors being wrong.</li><li>Fixed a problem with Sirens Grotto - Some people entering the zone were getting stuck.</li> <br><li>Fixed a problem with passage from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. Travel in that direction was supposed to require a key.</li> <br><li>We believe we fixed a problem where NPCs sometimes would hit a pet-owner no matter how far away the owner was from the pet and the NPC.  </li><li>Corrected loot drops in Thurgadin</li><br>We again appreciate patience while we stabilize following Velious launch.<br><br>                          - The EverQuest Team<br>                           </blockquote></p>

I personally think it was a joint plot between Gameglow and my wife.  Gameglow wants updates, and my wife is out of town and is enjoying my not being able to play.  Ok, maybe they had nothing to do with it, so while browsing I came across our new Velious spells.  They are:<br><ul><li>Armor of Protection, Level 34, Self only AC/Hitpoint buff (+15 AC, +225 hit points, 110 mana)</li><li>Turning of the Unnatural, Level 39, DOT vs Undead (400dmg, 180 mana)</li><br><li>Celestial Healing, Level 44, short duration (4 ticks) group regen (744 healed, 200 mana)</li><br><li>Improved Invisibility to Undead, Level 50, Fixed duration ITU (10 min, 75 mana)</li><br><li>Word of Stunning, Level 55, AE Stun (low radius, low resist, 9 second duration, 150 mana, 45 sec recast)</li><br><li>Aegolism, Level 60, upgrade to Heroism, group HP/AC buff (1100 hps, 54 AC, 900 mana, 1 peridot)</li></ul><br><br>I have to admit that I'm pretty excited about a few of those spells.  Aegolism is the best answer I've seen to why a Cleric wants to hit level 60.  It's a group Heroism/Marzin rolled into one.  And with Marzin stacking with it a level 60 Cleric can add 1800 hit points to group members.  1800!!!  That, my friends, is a LOT of hit points.<br><br>Word of Stunning is another very nice spell.  Ever find yourself or your group surrounded by a lot of mobs and wondering what you would do once your Div wore off?  Slap a stun on the lot of them.  Also gives us another tool when the Wizards and Enchanters decide to play "nuke em all."  A specialized spell to be sure, but one that I think will find some use.<br> <br>I remember feeling a bit of chagrin when I saw that Wizards were getting ITU.  Then I saw what ours does.  Wizards can have our castoff.  This makes our spell the best invis in the game, albeit ITU isn't used too much (alas).  Still, there are places that are strictly undead (e.g. deep in the Hole).  It's somewhat comforting that in those rare situations where I'll need to toss it I'll know it will work.<br><br>Group Celestial Heal and Turning of the Unnatural are the last two new spells.  Group Celestial Heal has an incredible HPs healed/Mana ratio (3.72:1).  Granted it's over 24 seconds, but it still has the best ratio available to Group Complete Heal.  It's another nice tool.  Turning of the Unnatural is the only spell I find a bit dissappointing.  It's ratio is only marginally better than Expel and it takes 96 seconds for its full effect to be reached.  I'm not sure why I would use this spell instead of casting Expel twice.<br><br>And finally, Armor of Protection.  A buff just for me =).  See, Verant knew I was getting close to 1k AC and wanted to help me out.  As a bonus all the other Clerics get it too.  Ok, dementia aside another 15AC/225 hit points is great.<br><br>Of course, these spells are not final and may change before (and after) Scars of Velious is released.<br><br>Regardless, I'm looking forward to our new spells.  Aegolism is enough to spur me to 60.</blockquote></p>
