So far every time we pull him he is accompanied by his 2 chronies.  If you have information about a successful strategy for defeating him, please share it with me.

Keep Vindi busy while you kill the pets and then let him come to camp... the pets are so trivial that cleric mana shouldn't be significantly affected by killing them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">runz</div><div class="date">08-25-2001, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i usual setup camp at the ramp begin of the arena left or right side doesnt matter<br />
<br />
reason why i setup camp here is because if you are fighting vindi or his pets you get almost no adds and vindi or his pets wont warp on eachothers because this is out of their argo range<br />
<br />
pulling vindi is easy<br />
i got vindi solo out of his lair 10X<br />
for pulling prefer a monk that has a high  fd rate<br />
if you setup camp on left side clear everything on the left side to vindi<br />
then the monk stand at the begin of vindi lair and use a shuriken and hit vindi<br />
hug the wall and run back <br />
out of vindi line of sight<br />
then wait for vindi to warp on you<br />
and you press FD at once<br />
there you got vindi solo<br />
now let your other monk chain you off<br />
pull vindi to the ramp<br />
and enjoy<br />
<br />
iam sure other guild use different tactic<br />
but since vinde pets has been nerfed you can not snare or root his pet anymore<br />
<br />
i hope you can use this info</div></div><hr />

I just realized that we never get his guards if we do the pull right the first time.<br />
<br />
Ask a monk, though.  I just give monks sweet healin' lovin'. :-p<br />

<br />
I have seen the Cleric healing cycles (5 seconds between CHeals and cycles threw about 6 clerics) in guilds used in 4 differant guilds in my server but seen 2 guilds do it not in shout and they say they are using a differant stratigy that seems to be better from what I hear.  Can anyone help me or hint me twards the right direction ? =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caleal</div><div class="date">09-11-2001, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pulling Vind/Tormax to the zone with non KOS people is lame and we refuse to do it.  =P<br />
<br />
Generally we have a monk pull vind and his 2 guards out into the open area outside the areana. The monk FDs and a bard with fresh SoW on occludes Vind to agro him, then kites him and his guards around. A monk then pulls a guard off and we kill it, then the other. The bard then brings Vindicator home and the warrior playing main tank for the fight smacks him as the bard runs past. Main tank group for the fight usually consists of 3 clerics, 2 warriors and a bard. The 2 warriors are the 1st and 2nd main tanks. First heal on the main tank comes from 1-3 paladins using LoH. The clerics cast CH in sequence 7 seconds apart continuously untill the warriors defensive disciplin is down, then we tighten the sequence to land the CHs at 5 second intervals. Vendicator usually lives for less than 5 min.<br />
<br />
We do the same general thing for the Statue, exept when it is pulled to camp, a ranger intercepts it off the bard and tanks it with his parry disciplin while the statue is debuffed and slowed. Once slowed, a warrior steps in and takes agro. We use a 10 second heal timing on the slowed statue. We are actually overhealing at 10 seconds but don't want to push the timing out any further due to possible lucky quads by the statue, slow breaks, etc. Last time we killed the statue the only death was the main tank who went down because his disciplin went down at the exact same instant that the statue got a lucky quad. It didn't help any that he is a Wood Elf warrior /tease Titanax. He was resed back in and fighting before the battle was over. Even the ranger and bard have lived the last 2 times. lol<br />
<br />
3 cleric with c2, potg, GoB, a bard a steady supply of mod rods, and 3 necros to feed them mana can keep CHs landing on a main tank every 6-7 seconds for a very long time. Our last fight vs Lendairia the Keeper lasted 11 min and all 3 of us finished at 70-80% mana. At about 8 min into the fight we were yelling at the necros to feed other clerics because we were all at or near full mana. I cast CH 21 times in that fight and finished with about 75% mana.<br />
<br />
One of our alliance members had a theory about how to kill the Avatar of War. Unfortunatly it would require about 100 level 60 rangers if his numbers are correct. If we can ever assemble 100 level 60 rangers to give it a whirl, I'll let you know how it goes.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than the obvious (clerics *move* to keep in range) is there a way to resolve this?<br />
