I've only been to Karnor Castle and that's about it.<br />
<br />
I'm one bubble away from 52... where should I go for good exp gain in group? Loot doesn't matter at all, and I don't really like soloing.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any information!  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

You may also want to go to Trakanon teeth and pick up the medallions for a Sebilis key, but having just gotten the medallions myself I don't know how populus sebilis is.  City of Mist might be another one to try, but Karnors is the most convenient dungeon on the continent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Medger</div><div class="date">06-23-2000, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Karnor and Skyfire are the only places I've found for casual exp. And once you bum a sow and know the route they're only 10 minutes or so apart.<br />
<br />
CoM had too many greens at 52. And it's hard to just casually hunt reavers. I suppose you could pick on Goos.<br />
<br />
Chardock and Sebilis are hard to just zone into and shout for a group.<br />
<br />
At 55 I've been hanging out in Skyfire a lot lately. Once you get the pulling down it's easy to get singles to snare and fear. Snare/fear on a single mob is just relaxing compared to ROK dungeon pulls. And there are usually only a few people in the zone so you also get a break from Karnor's constant trains and res requests. And we get a spell drop now and then. Two nights ago a kind Skycinder Drake dropped Yaulp 4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just made two Sebilis keys this morning (one for bank) and hopefully I go there with friends sometime.<br />
<br />
I'll try Karnor and Skyfire for casual exp gaining.<br />

So much faster than a bank run...</div></div><hr />

When you die the key is on you, not on your corpse.  So don't waste getting 2 keys anymore.<br />
