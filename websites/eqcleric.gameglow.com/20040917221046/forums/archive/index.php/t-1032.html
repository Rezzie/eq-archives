I'll have 41st lvl and finally be outta mediocrity.  hehe.  To say a cleric can't solo is rediculous.  Been doing that in Lower Guk now for a little bit of time with relative ease.  Once I get Retribution or Banish, I'm gonna rock that place.  hehe.  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, is that at 30th lvl, I think my cleric would've taken my 46th lvl warrior in a duel.  Ick.<br />

I do it all the time when waiting for a group. Once you get banish, try soloing around the &quot;safehall&quot; between the lower tower area and the frenzy area. I get great experience soloing wans and zols, faster then being in a group.<br />

Talk about NICE exp while in 40th lvl!  hehe.  Tonight, I'll do my normal routine of &quot;/shout Anyone casting clarity?  I'll come to you!&quot;  hehe  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'm really lookin' forward to 44th lvl as I'll finally be rockin' hard.  Insanely powerfull for the area that I'm in with little to no problems.  Even now, when I have problems, I'm already used to rooting everything attacking me, running to a safe spot and then gating out.  hehe.<br />

Wrath does 160 max dmg in pvp at lvl 30... I think forget if its 15 or 20% :P<br />
<br />
A lvl 46 warrior has an innate MR bonus... MR is the bane of clerics, and even when a nuke hits its not always going to be full...<br />
<br />
Anyways.. 46 warrior who doesnt have a respectable MR deserves a beatdown, hehehe.<br />
<br />
Oh ya soloing... good stuff. Solo'ed ramp trash in Lguk for a lil bit at 34 was just kinda hard breaking it and no one ever killed the live frogs so it was a pain sometimes heh. *shrug*. Friend at 52 was soloing ass/sup to exe once which is pretty cool.<br />
