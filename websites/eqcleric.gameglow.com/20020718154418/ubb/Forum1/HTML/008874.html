</FONT><HR>I have a question regarding gems defaulting to clerics and whether this is normal or not. Let me explain the situation.<P>I am a 60 paladin, my wife plays a 60 shaman. We usually fight in small groups, almost exclusively with friends. My wife still needs torpor, so we plan on camping the emperor in sebilis. Our plan was to just fight for xp in the zone until a rogue we know comes online.<P>We are duoing and slowly form a group, grabbing an enchanter and a wizard. We get a lower level warrior to act as back up tank and more damage output. We have been fighting for about an hour or so between the zonein and zoneout, with me pulling things from down by disco, down by jail, anything that's alive. My health has not gone down below 2 bubbles (I have C2 and can CC myself). Essentially, it was pathetically easy. <P>We are about to move to the necro jail, but the enchanter (level 54 or so) insists on having a cleric. We find a cleric and head out. We get to the jail and the clerics says "all gems to me". The enchanter acts as if this is fine.<P>Is this standard? I had been the one buffing. I was casting naltron on everyone (same symbol the cleric had). I was casting Shield of Words on myself and the warrior (same AC buff the cleric had). I had already hit everyone up with reso, and the cleric had yet to give us hero. Essentially this cleric had done absolutely nothing. <P>When the members of the group (other than my wife) all agree to give the gems to the cleric, I asked in group "Why?" The response was "to help pay for dots" That's when I politely point out that I had been the one casting naltron for the past hour and a half and that the cleric had yet to cast a single spell in 5-10 minutes.<P>It struck me as the biggest scam in the game. The cleric insisted on getting the gems, even after it was pointed out that he had spent no dots, nor would he need to spend any dots at all. He didn't care, he wanted the gems. "That's just the way it works, we need a cleric" was something said by a group member.<P>After my wife and I left the group, they needed a tank much more than we needed a cleric while I was with them.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>"gems to the cleric"<P>I call bull ****.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>This is often on a very touchy subject with clerics. As a general rule, clerics make very little money on a daily basis (despite people who think we make bazillions of pp doing rezzes... a lot of us don't charge =P)<P>I'm sure every cleric out there has been stiffed MANY times on peridot costs. Most non-clerics don't realize the peridot costs involved in keeping 6 people symbolled for a night of xping. It's roughly 65pp an hour, using Naltron or Marzin.<P>HOWEVER, the cleric you met with was being totally unreasonable IMO. Sebilis has so many spell/gem/sellable item drops that a night's xp can easily net each member of a group hundreds or thousands of pp after selling/splitting.<P>The fairest solution, and the one I've seen the most often in Seb, is to have someone master loot, then sell & split all sellable drops after you leave the zone. Reimburse the cleric in your group (or any other class that buffed with reagents) for the number of peridots they used for the night, then split the rest of the pp evenly between all group members. Divide any nice item drops or rare gems as you see fit. (random, NBG, whatever)<P>My personal best was doing the Nec/Guard camp for 8-9 hours one night. We got almost 30 "rare" gems (9 BDs, 11 diamonds, 7 black pearls), over 40 other sellable gems, a lammy and an RBG, plus several of all the common drops of the named in that camp. Total pp split between 6 ppl was something like 1600pp EACH, plus we each got 4-5 rare gems and rolled on the items. After they reimbursed me for peris, of course =P<P>Defaulting all gem drops to the cleric is pure greed IMO. If even one blue diamond drops in a 4hr xp night, he's made his peridot cost back PLUS another couple thousand pp. (assuming BDs still sell for 2-3k hehe)<P>Just tell him he'll be fully reimbursed for his peridot costs before the rest of the loot is split. If he argues, ditch him, he's being greedy.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=47567" TARGET=_blank>Morinkhan</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.furys-edge.com" TARGET=_blank><BR>Fury's Edge</A><BR>Morell-Thule<p>[This message has been edited by MorinkhanMT (edited 07-10-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>You're right, that was total BS. Should be "gems to the person spending money on the group".<P>The practice of giving gems to the Cleric in Seb started back in the day when everyone's level and economy meant that it was a HUGE drain on a Cleric's account to be continually burning peridots on everyone. And this was in several zones, but Seb was the only place that you could make a significant advance on your expenses spent.<P>Now other classes use Peridots too, and there are certainly not enough challenges in Seb or elsewhere in Kunark or Antonica to cause the same financial drain due to 'dot usage as there were in the day when Kunark was king of the hill.<P>The real practice SHOULD be, "all tanks carry a stack of 'dots and offer them up to the casters that run low or ask". Isn't that pretty much what happens when the group needs port stones, or corpse coffins, or any other reasonably expensive reagent that's used to help everyone? Of course, that only works well in a guild situation. In Pick-Up groups you'll always run into greedy bastards.<P>Qanimaru...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>BTW, has seb turned into LoIO2 on other servers? I hadn't been to seb (except for trak raids and juggs and reets) in a long, long time. I was appalled at the lack of knowledge of the game by most of the people there.<P>We start heading to the jail before the cleric got there, and the 54 warrior asked my 60 shaman wife "are you sure you can heal enough for the jail?" My wife and I laughed, then pointed out that I was the one who had done all of the healing for the past hour. Clue number 1.<P>Initially the group wanted to do friendly loot. Clue number 2.<P>The enchanter says "boy, you sure hit hard" I respond with "I'm sure (the ranger) is doing more damage than I am". She responds "but you hold aggro so well!" I respond "I'm a paladin." Hello! 60 paladin here. Clue number 3.<P>I'm staying away from seb...unless the necro jail is open for me to solo.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>"are you sure you can heal enough?"

</FONT><HR>Clerics get handed a huge burden having to symbol/Aego entire raids and all exp groups.  Most raids don't reimburse the cost.  Most clerics have accepted this as a fact of life.  When you're spending up to 1000p a night so everyone can have their raid, you have to have some means of getting your money back.  Otherwise the peridot well will soon run dry.<P>Now, I usually only group with guild folks and they already know, quite well because I complain a lot, about our costs.  However, when I feel like I've recouped my recent costs I start sharing with the group.<P>So, you could be paying for the piper for raiding.  <p>[This message has been edited by electrae (edited 07-10-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Grouping with your own guild folks and grouping with strangers are completely different.  Why should complete strangers fund a cleric they don't know, so he can buff his guild?  That's completely unreasonable in my opinion.  My guild gives out money/peridots to raid clerics, even doing that when I'm xping with just guild people they will generally give all the gems to me for peridot costs for raids (which I wish they wouldn't but they generally insist).  But I wouldn't expect people outside of my guild that I grouped with to fund me for my guild raiding.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Just thought I would post my thoughts on this  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>As a cleric I have a legitimate expense shelling out for peridots. Prior to 58 (? group symbol) I would always symbol every melee, and bard/chanter (chanter especially as they draw such high aggro, and have such poor AC/HP), say 4 dots an hour plus deaths, new additions etc.<P>In a zone like Old Sebelis, where lots of gems drop, people are usually willing to "give all the gems to the Cleric".  However I always take  just enough to cover what I believe my cost to have been (and usually I estimate to the high side, as I often get nothing and eat the expense).  I insist that the rest be distributed evenly amongst the group, including myself.  That was simply to cover my expenses, and I request a share of the excess just like anyone else.  Anything else is simply greed on the part of the cleric.<P>Group symbol at 58(?) greatly reduced this expense, and my requests for gems accordingly.  At this point I would often just eat the cost as it was only one dot every hour or so.<P>However, once I hit 60, my expense for dots increased tremendously.  Blessing of Aegolism costs 4 dots for 2 hours, plus one or two for new recruits or deaths, so say 6 every 2+ hours.  To make matters worse, I have made my home in Cazic Thule, where there is no cash loot, and very little saleable loot (ie gems,icepaw scalps).  I regularily shell out for a stack of dots at the end of every night now, and hopefully I recieved something in lotto that I can sell.<P>Oh yeah...I bought a Phase Spider Carapase last weekend, and I have been broke ever since  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Baroness Ailsa Noanaz<BR>Erudite High Priestess of Quellious<BR>on Mithaniel Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Also..<P>If a previous group or raid stiffed that cleric...it's OK to feel bad. It's OK to offer more..<P>But it's not your fault and you shouldn't HAVE to pay for it. The people who should pay for it is the guild or person that sponsored the raid, or that past groups members.<P>To the person who said basically all raids give DoT's to clerics. That is so untrue..that's the exception not the rule. My guild does provide DoT's now..but it didn't do it so much in the past. My previous guilds never did.<P>But still that isn't other peoples problem. That's a problem of the people in your guild. If you want to recoup funds spent on raids, grap your guildmates and group up..ask for all the gems from that group and explain it's to cover for the most recent raids expenditures. If they disagree then maybe you should look for a new guild...not a new exp group.<P>In short...your exp group is only responsible for the peridots you spend on THEM. Not the peridots you spend on OTHER PEOPLE. They could care less if your gruildmates go without Symbol ona raid...why would they care? It doesn't affect them at all.<P>If you need DoT's on a raid...explain your low on funds..after a few raids say you will symbol anyone who supplies the peridot. But of they don't have the peridot your sorry, you just can't afford it.<P>Same goes for necro's and coffins, mages and CoH...wizards and ports to places like PoH and PoA or translocates. Basically if money is spent on a reagent, it should be compensated for from the raid or group funds at that time....not from some poor random guy the next day.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20365" TARGET=_blank>Citra Dangermouse-60 ENC</A><BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20357" TARGET=_blank>Venerable Pilsburry Dangermouse-60 CLR</A><BR>Celestial Tomb<BR>VEESHAN</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It's standard to give all gems to the cleric in a seb group on my server... but that is under the assumption that they are actually buffing the group. Whether or not they decide to keep all or split the gems according to what they need seems to be up to the cleric. Most I have grouped with (while on my wizard), just keep all the gems to make up for costs in places where there is no form of refund. I'm not sure this is fair, but I'm not going to personally argue with it either. I would have a bone to pick however if a cleric wanted the gems but didn't cast the symbols and such. I have never thought of gems as a lure to get a cleric to join/stay in a seb group. It's not a form of payment, but a form of reimbursement for the costs used on the group.<p>[This message has been edited by Kyrah (edited 07-10-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>No, defaulting all gems to the cleric is not how it should go.<P>Every character should be reimbursed for the expenses they incur while grouped, be that peridots, coffins, pearls..whatever.<P>But you need to understand that clerics do get shafted on dots sometimes. I still get shafted around 10% of the time in pickup groups and it drives me nuts.<P>The worst case of getting shafted happened when I was level 52. One of the top guilds on our server was up for Rage but Naggy was up. So, they throw together this open raid and invite me. They have me symbol the whole raid while promising to repay me after the raid. I was in the exp group and I saw him loot a diamond and a ruby. We get ported out and when I asked about repaying the 40 or so dots I get disbanded and they port away. Needless to say members of that guild can't buy a rez from me no matter what they offer.<P>Vanya</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I think it depends on the server.  Clerics don't get to roll on some of the best items that drop, so don't have many replacement items to sell (weapons, haste items, even most plate armor doesn't count for NGB to clerics, while a heirophant's cloak can go to a melee with no one blinking).  Even 100 platinum a resurrection (if they charge) isn't much when you look at the time involved.  100 platinum to go resurrect someone in Dalhnir is a lot of time for little gain for the time.<P>As a paladin, you probably went to a lot of Nagafen and Vox raids, were the clerics reimbursed for peridots during those raids?  Or did they have to eat the expense so you could have a chance at your epic item?  What sort of items were they allowed to roll on?<P>I have seen many very wealthy melees, and many very poor clerics.  Yes, I have also seen many very wealthy clerics that do abuse the cash drops.  It isn't unusual for rare gems to be randomed to a group, while cash drops all go to the cleric (I prefer to split with the enchanters who tend to also be very poor on my server and then spread out the rest after making my reagent money back and extra to pay for raiding.  The enchanters tend to start casting jasper runes and make my job easier.).<P>Pick up group clerics often (though not always) are also pick up raid clerics.  An axe of frost doesn't cover the reagent costs of Kael raids, and that is about the best a cleric can expect raiding Kael.<P>Was the cleric greedy?  Tell me about his equipment and level, then tell me about your equipment.  Abuse by clerics exists, but abuse of clerics also exists.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>hehe wow<P>Obviously a lot of different solutions on different servers. I've NEVER heard of "all gems go to clerics" this thread.<P>I've also almost never been on a raid where I wasn't reimbursed in pp for my peridot expenses, or given a couple stacks at the start of the raid. Maybe once or twice on open raids waaaay back...<P>Maybe it's just my personality, but "all gems to the cleric" just seems like pure greed to me. It doesn't make sense for a pickup group. If I was anyone else in that group besides the cleric, all I'd be thinking of is the huge pp gain the cleric is getting, FAR beyond his actual peridot costs.<P>Sure, maybe if it was a group that xps together often, you're all friends and everyone knows you're always short on cash... maybe then, they could be nice and let me have all the gems. But a stranger in a pickup group? I'll make sure you're reimbursed out of the group's total loot for any costs you incurred, but beyond that, you get your 1/6th, just like everyone else.<P>If Seb's not a good zone for a cleric item-wise, put together a new group and go somewhere where good cleric loot DOES drop.<P>--Edit--<BR>hehe just remembered... things can be vastly different on different servers. I know a few server transfers who were shocked that Seb isn't a pick-up group zone on MT. It's not.

</FONT><HR>The point about the equipment was simply to point out that NBG may have made enough of a difference to argue that "all gems to the cleric" might be evening the loot situation out.  I do agree, NBG is bad, and I would prefer to do away with it.  AGTTC is also bad when you random everything also.  NBG and AGTTC might not be such a bad combination together.  Melee gear tends to be very expensive on my server.  Mostly due to the amount of money melees make with NBG.  Cleric gear tends to be cheap by comparison (though not MQed Velious armor of course).  I am just a bit bitter from seeing Rangers auctioning lupine daggers then showing up at the Drolvarg Captain camp looking for a group and similar occurances.  The cash items on that camp are a joke, and there isn't anything a cleric can roll on if their group members all managed to sell the gear they won based on "need".<P>The Nagafen and Vox raids I was thinking of were all pickup raids.  I was reimbursed for reagents on those once.  I have rolled on an item from the dropped loot only once also.  That was a Vox raid with about 12 people rolling on the Tobrin's Mystic Eyepatch. If TME sells for 24 k, then I only got 2k of value from all my Nagafen and Vox raids.<BR>: feels like a sucker.<BR>If you only did guild dragon raids using guild funds, you wouldn't be able to relate, and I am sorry for bringing it up.<P>Most of my good equipment I either quested for, bought with trade skill money, or is no drop from raids.  The rest of my gear is on the order of guantlets of the black and jasper rings.  That said, I wouldn't have done this, but can understand those that do and those that allow it to be done.<P>My advice to understand the loot situation is to talk to your wife about her income in groups (not solo, clerics solo abysmally).  Now add your reagent expenses to that income.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Well, maybe I've just been lucky in my raiding career, but this is the general way it went for me when I hit 46 or so and started down the road to being a "raid cleric".<P>I went to any and all raids I could find. I was one the only plane-capable players in my guild at that time, so all my raids involved me bumming my way along with larger guilds. We had very few Open raids in those days on MT.<P>My only requirement was that I got reimbursed for any costs I incurred. I went into every raid with absolutely no expectations of loot, gems, or xp.<P>I began building a reputation as a solid cleric that would attend almost any raid, so guilds would come looking for me if they were short on clerics. As I got to know people, they would often allow me to roll on limited cleric items (ie. Hate boots or gaunts etc), because I was helping their guild on a regular basis.<P>Most often, the raids I attended had next to no chance at any loot for myself. But since I was always willing to help out, the friends I made and the guilds I aided finally started giving me a full chance at anything I might want to claim or roll on.<P>In retrospect, this worked out so well for me. I made a lot of friends, I got a great rep as a good cleric, got a lot of guildinvites, but most importantly, I got a good idea about who all the good and ambitious players on our server were. This helped me a lot when I finally started looking for a high-end guild.<P>As it stands now, I'm in the top guild on MT. We're in VT, should have it cleared soon. I play with a fantastic group of players, work with a very strong group of clerics and have no worries about loot or cash. My guild takes care of it's clerics, because they realize that we're the core of a high-end guild. I'm handed stacks of peridots whenever I'm out, the guild bought or made me my GVD, Earring of the Solstice, and my Faithstone. The only thing I've bought myself in the past several months was I saved up and splurged on a horse =P<P>I guess what I'm trying to say is... an active cleric that is free with his time and efforts will eventually be rewarded.<P>Man, sorry I turned this into a novel, I just got carried away during some downtime in VT. =P</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>It's DoT (Dead on Tuesday)!   These folks are my buddies and they take care of me when we group. <P>KC didn't fund peridots until towards the end.  It takes a lot of organization and bookkeeping to do a guild bank, and we were always short on those attributes.  I don't think most guilds do.  Shoot, we did a joint raid with Unconquered a while back and I Aego'd all 50 people 3 times and never got a single peridot.<P>Fortunately I group with the same people all the time and they see I'm taken care of.  I don't know what hurt more, spending the mana or the money.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>Not all clerics raid with a single guild, folks.  Lots of people do raids with alliances or freelance clerics.  I bet the folks that complain about clerics getting gems aren't forking over any dots or cash to clerics on raids.  That's always been my experience.<P>Like you Higar, I often times have to force people to take gems/money when doing exp groups.<P>  <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by NightGod:<BR><B> Ele....wow....what raids are you going on? DbT needs to start a guild fund NOW to cover raid costs, and if its an open raid, you need to gate out if you don't get a satisfactory answer to "How will my dot costs be reimbursed?" within 5 mins of getting there. The only time I've had trouble getting reimbursed for gem costs was an early Fear raid that had just horrible VT drops...I got a fair share of the gems that *did* drop, but it was still not enough to cover my costs...that was more the zones fault than the raids, however.<P>That said...I've found the opposite to be true...I have trouble giving away money at the end of a night in Seb. No...seriously...everyone says "that's OK, I got [x] exp and a SCH for my rogue twink, more than enough". /boggle...last time I ended up splitting the VT between me and the druid out of a group of 6 people...and she almost gated off before I could give her anything. Hell, one time my buddy didn't get anything to cover gems and didn't say anything. The ML from that group hunted him down the next day and gave him about 5 times what he had spent on dots...<P>Ah well, I definately prefer the "no, take all the money, stop trying to offer us some" over the "WHAAT!!?!? You want to keep two ruby crowns to cover your costs? GREEDY CLERIC!" that I've seen some people go through (thought I agree, cleric in the above example = greedy cleric).<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><p>[This message has been edited by electrae (edited 07-11-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>For normal exp groups I don't use too many gems. I won't throw Naltron around except maybe on an Enchanter or the puller. I'll give Pinzarn to whoever wants it. Now if someone hands me a fire opal lets say, then everyone will get a round of Naltron (level 52). Unlesss it's a raid, I conserve dots until I see some good gems. Some groups don't think about it at all and others will try to hand me every gem that drops. I feel like if I've left a group having gained as much pp as I've lost it's all good. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I have never taken it as rule of law and never absolute either.<P>Typically most of the group gems do go to the cleric for the sole purpose to reimburse for the DoTs they use.<P>Now I also need to say that at those times when I am not using DoTs or another person is it is then that person that gets the bulk of the gems.<P>Typically we get enough to give everyone in group a gem or two and the cleric (DoT user) twice as many or more.<P>I am completely against any absolute rule and giving all the gems to the Cleric is just wrong.  Everyone else puts in their help as well.   Everyone ought to walk away from the group with something if possible.<P>There are two decently well known Clerics that hang out in Seb on Tunare (won't list their horrid names to be semi nice) that are the epitome of loot whores (and more).  Demanding all the gems period should define that.

</FONT><HR>Personally I agree with the "costs should be covered where they're encurred" thread that most everyone is saying in one vein or another.<P>But to those of you who say "costs should only be covered on this one group, I shouldn't be responsible for what happens elsewhere." Well... is Seb the ONLY Place that you ever to pickup groups? Do the clerics in your pickup groups get compensated in those other zones that you rely on them? In a lot of cases the answer is "no" unfortunately.<P>You're right, it's not your fault. And perhaps those Clerics should manage their expenses better. But the reason that the "all gems to clerics" exists in some circles is that those people feel that they can make up for all of the Clerics other expenses in other places by just letting them have this one perk in one zone. I've seen it before and been on the receiving end of "all gems" regardless of what kind of protests I put up. But I was told just to take 'em and shut up, just make sure to take care of them in some other zone, or res them for free (which I do always anyway), or whatever.<P>I don't personally agree with it. But there is a logic there that obviously some people seem to feel is justified. *shrug*<P>Qani...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

If he doesn't then u don't give him anything if he does then thats fine, give him a normal pp stone now and then but not BD/D etc.. a few rubys should cover most expences..<BR>I can't even remember how many K pp in dots I've spent on symbs that I never got a CP for..( one of the reasons I got 2 stacks of jaspers on me..a group that feels that they don't want to give the cleric a refund for stones only get jasper buffs a group that is aware of the cost of symb spells get en dot buffs)<BR>But I would kick out any cleric that felt that he should be defaulted every stone that drops, in a area that drops alot of high PP stones.<BR>it's not a rule that clerics should recive stones it's just a polite way of saying that you know that he is spending extra pp on the group and you think that he should recive something for it.<P>But what I can't understand is why a pally would continue to cast symb and other buffs when he has a cleric in the group...think about it, you join a group and the pally keeps casting buffs on the group members..it's like saying to the cleric we don't need/want you..doesn't a pally have any better use of their mana then to cast buffs ? when there is a cleric in the group ? last time I checked a pally spell list it looked like they do have a few better spells to waste their mana on then to keep buffing a group after a cleric joined the group. (pally's do get a group buff spell or two that is nice..but casting symbols..bah)<BR>Two sides of the story I think..but then again I might be wrong here..<P>------------------<BR>Advert Silverhand<BR>Cleric of Brell<P>Drunken bartender of Brell<BR>(But I only Drink stuff I can summon)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>If/when a paladin and a cleric in the same group happen to have the same buff spell, SOmetimes the paladin will offer to cover that buff to spare the cleric the mana. Heck, when the main paly in my former guild got a velious breastplate, I made him do ac buffs in my group, as his shield of words was the same as mine.<P>------------------<BR>Gniss Fleshmender<BR>Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>When I am in Seb (and often other places too) I usually am the ML for the group. Here is how I normally divide it up...<P>- PP and GP split to the group as it accumulates. I keep little to none of the cash for myself, except SP...that's drinking money.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"> CP gets destroyed.<P>- Rare gems and items get rolled on, unless someone can convince the group otherwise. Usually, no one has a problem with class armor going to that class by default if they need it, but I have seen some pretty big arguments over non-specific items like Lammies; I just put my foot down and say SHUT UP AND ROLL when this happens.<P>- Research stuff and spells default to the class that needs them, if they're present. Otherwise the research items get destroyed, and extra spells go into the pool for rolling.<P>- Non-rare gems and jewelry, I keep enough of for myself to cover peridots and maybe a bit more, especially if I didn't win any item rolls. After all, if I don't make SOME profit, I'd never be able to buy spells or upgrade my gear. BUT, I am always sure to split a few trinkets to each group member as well. Everyone should walk away from my group with SOMETHING, even if it's just a gem or two. And you'd be surprised how far this bit of generosity goes in terms of keeping people happy. You should have seen the look on a certain enchanter's face when I turned around and handed her two fire opals and a couple of extra spells that no one else wanted...<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>Dwarf Cleric-54, Rathe<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=15436" TARGET=_blank>View my profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Call me silly, but IMHO unless you have a full group, you need somebody. To me, there are few things more offensive in EQ than when you have an odd number of people in the zone, so you know that not all the groups are full, yet there is someone sitting at the zone LFG because the jackasses in the partial group are going "We don't need X class..." Think of the play time of others besides you, and let them in. You'll have just made someone's day, and who knows, you just might make a new friend as well.<P>------------------<BR>Galavant Greenlabel<BR>Dwarf Cleric-54, Rathe<BR><A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=15436" TARGET=_blank>View my profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008874-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008874-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008874&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008874&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
