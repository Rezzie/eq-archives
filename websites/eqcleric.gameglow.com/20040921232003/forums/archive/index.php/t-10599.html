<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daia</div><div class="date">12-27-1999, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was having a very slow time at level 30 in Rathe Mountains even though I was soloing Giant Skeletons and grouping for Cyclopses and Hill Giants.<br />
<br />
So on a whim I took someone's suggestion that I try the basement of Highhold Keep.  The experience just blazed through.  Took me about 5 of my normal play sessions (2-4 hours each) hours each with only 1 death down there to not only get the remaining 4 bubbles of 30 I needed, but 1.5 bubbles into 31.<br />
<br />
At level 30 you can solo stray pickclaw guards and lookouts.  In a group pulling from &quot;the hole&quot;, a cleric is a beloved friend and you will definitely find a group.<br />
<br />
I hear that experience dries up a lot after 32, but there are plenty of people level 35 and up still here (grouped with a level 39 yesterday) getting experience off pickclaw raiders.<br />
<br />
The only downside is that the loot is not as good here as other places.  I average about 25 plat a session, nothing compared to other places.  But hey, I'm not going to complain =)</div></div><hr />

I think I started around 24, and finally left at 33.  At the time when i first went there it was a barron waste land.  There would be like 5 people in the zone at peak times.  I remember people didn't even know what was down there in the whats now refered to as the warrior and raider rooms.  But slowly the place filled up as word spread about the amazing xp.  But after L33 i just couldnt take it anymore.  I had to get out of there.  Talk about xp grinding =)  But I did see a L39 in there once.  I returned at 36 once, just being bored, and noone would let me in a group, as most of them were high 20's =) <br />
    Of course this was on a newer server...Brell Serilis.  Now the place packed, glad i was there in the beginning tho, never had to wait around for groups =)<br />

Yes, the exp is great from 20-31, but I hate that place. I stayed there for so many lvls. the only reason I would be there at lvl 30 is because I want to get out of hell lvl (30). I've been in highpass and high keep for over 11 lvls and most of the time, clerics are #1 there besides tanks. Also that's where all the enchanters hide..hee hee. It becomes boring after awhile hearing all the kill stealing and such, but I would go here for a couple of lvls at least but most of the time the bull crap isn't worth the exp.<br />

<br />
One thing I only found out last night - there is a prisoner called Osargen in the jail - he is on a 6 minute spawn - still cons blue to me at Lv30.  1 root 3 Wraths and he drops.  You then have enough time to med up before he pops again.<br />
<br />
So if you can't get in a group, and hes not camped (rare, he is a popular camp) you can solo here easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also- are you sure about Osargen being blue to someone in their 30's?  I was doing him at 26-ish. He was blue then.<br />
<br />
Don't forget the 3 prisoners need to be removed and well-spaced.  Someone once mentioned that they will beat on Osargen, but I never found that.<br />

That amazed me and I wondered if they upped the levels a bit on them.<br />
<br />
I spent far too long down there in the beginning..ugh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nemean</div><div class="date">05-10-2000, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Osargen was blue to me at lv30 and every 2 kills I was seeing my xp bar move - and in hell thats pretty impressive.<br />
<br />
However I got 31 last night and he is now green to me - still gives xp, but not much.<br />
<br />
Yes, prisoners attack you, but at lv30 I could melee them with Caudaceus pretty easily - didnt even bother casting on them.</div></div><hr />

Just make sure you get the last hit or you will loose the exp.<br />
