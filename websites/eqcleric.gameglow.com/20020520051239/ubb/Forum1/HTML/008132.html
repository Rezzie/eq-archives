</FONT><HR>We need ways to augment melees abilities in a group or duo such that getting a shaman or druid over us is NOT a wise choice. <P>Oh but you say, "clerics get groups fine! You're nuts or have a bad rep". Wrong. A melee in good equipment does NOT take enough damage to make getting a cleric useful. Instead, getting a nuker/dotter/thorns/slows/hastes AND heals is much smarter.<P>I'm not talking some level 56 tank in VL with a frostbringer and indicolite. Yes a cleric will be needed.<P>But when you start having tanks with 1400 ac 5000 hp unbuffed, the fact is they can absolutely demolish blue mobs without needing more then augmenting heals to complement their invig bp or their fungi.<P>WE DO NOT NEED NEW HEALS. We do NOT need new raid spells. We need things to make us VIABLE in any XP grind zone other then Cazic Thule.<P>Thanks.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Actually.. if there was one raid enhancement id ask for, it would be group AC and group resistance buffs. Cause... DAMN. those resistance spells are level 30 and 35 and dont last for crap. having to mem it and slowly cast it every 30 minutes on every group member is the biggest pain in the butt. <g> I dont care if its not as powerfull as the druid ones<P>BTW how can you say we arnt viable in other zones? id like to see you take on pits in velks, or jugs and shrooms in seb, snakes in ssra.. or the most of HS (Those harm touches will whipe out the mana of just about any non cleric) without a cleric. <g> maybe if you didnt stick to wussy camps. <P>------------------<BR>---<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32524" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A><p>[This message has been edited by Luminar (edited 03-14-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Luminar, it is not the clerics that stick to the wussy camps, it is everyone else.  Melees looking for alt xp don't go to the shrooms or juggs or Ssra.  They go solo or duo mobs in Velks, upper Seb, and a few other places.<P>I love HS, but I haven't gone in 3 months.  It is too hard to get a full group together to go, when almost everyone else can solo or duo for good xp.  No one wants to leave their spots, travel to HS, take some risks, and then have to go somewhere else when a couple of members of the group have to log.  <P>I don't know anyone who really enjoys grinding for xp post-60.  Everyone does it for the abilities.  People would rather solo for safe, steady xp under their own terms.  No waiting for other people who are afk, LD, etc.  No having to leave a place when someone else needs to log.  And if you do form a full group, why get a cleric when you can get another melee for more damage?<P>Schatze is right.  A well equiped level 60 simply outclasses Kunark mobs.  Clerics aren't needed for xp mobs.  Almost all my xp from the last three months has been from AoE groups because they are the only type of group that needs a cleric.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

Really I still consider this the exception rather than a rule of thumb.  If I am correct in my assumption then those few Warriors that have the above, sure they will take a Shaman or Druid over us.  I don't see how that justifies new melee enhancing spells for us for that fringe population but ?<P>2)  "We need things to make us VIABLE in any XP grind zone"  We have these tools already, in fact I have not found a zone in my experience where I hindered xp gain, to a non-acceptable ratio, as a duo yet.  Seb, Velks, Solb, Guk, Kael, CS, W.L are just some examples.  Considering our "must have" status for end game raids, I think thats balanced, if other classes can offer a bit more in xp grinds, for duos.<P>3) 200 - 300 hitting mobs, should not be duo xp mobs imo.<P>At the end of the day a high level Shaman will make a better partner for a Warrior or Monk (slow haste etc), but Clerics are still a viable alternative.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I do agree with all the posters, to some extent. It's really just your own opinion... But...<P>Smegal, if a mob is going after a caster it means he has generated a bit more aggro then the tank, yes? And if a cleric launches a big heal (TM) at the caster, the cleric is likely to surplant the caster and have to DA/DB. If this is frequent, then you'll have a dead cleric rather then a dead caster.<P>Somethign like a CE 900hp a pulse for 2 pulses, it would heal more then DL, cause less aggro... just my idea.<P>However, I really don't see clerics needing a power increase in raids. It just isn't that big a priority for me, even if it saved lives...<P>Like i said, it's really just an opinion.<P>But I'm sick of people asking for UNREALISTIC stuff heh :P we haven't gotten any healing upgrades for 2 expansions... which if you're of my mind, means that the other spells should increase utility, or B.) that we're a healer 1st 2nd and third and that we should have new viable heals... well it's really just which viewpoint you are.<p>[This message has been edited by Schatze (edited 03-14-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Actually no we don't need any new heals. DL is just short of a 1k heal and it's fine. If you're in an exp group, the fact of the matter is, casters should not be getting aggro, period. They need to learn when to nuke, not to sit immediately, etc. There really is no excuse for it.<P>Similarly, if one does get aggroed it shouldn't just be a walk in the park to get it off. There shouldn't be caster CH basically.<P>What we do need, which we started to get via Judgement, is more soloing capabilities. Quite literally, every other class can solo very well at 60 w/ a couple AA points. Even rogues can do it, because of their half decent AC and sheer damage output. Coming from a 60 cleric who has tried soloing on many occasions, it takes roughly 9.5 min / mob including med time w/ basic regen. BAotR would make it about 8.2 minutes, and the absolute best we can do, with BAotR, PotG, FT15, and KEI is 4 minutes a mob. I'm lucky if I can kind a KEI, let alone PotG, and most people aren't going to breach FT5, let alone 15.<P>Point is, most clerics can never hope to kill a mob and med back in under 7.5 min (best place I know is grey), whereas just about any other class can do it in 5 or less (PAL's can probably drop most mobs and med / heal back up in 2.5 min or less).<P>THAT is where we need some help. A Venerable High Priest shouldn't need to nearly extinguish his mental powers just to slay 1 simple minion. And if you get an add.. rootcamp or zone.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>You are asking for a new heal why? It will not make you more desirable as a partner than a Shaman. Yes maybe the druid, but I'm not a big fan of druids anyways.<P>The reason a Shaman is chosen, they have adequate healing, (a cleric is currently more than capable of providing the healing for a group), but on TOP of that, they have buffs, haste, slows. Now if the cleric could provide an alternative to that line up, I'm not saying the same things, just something different. Then that would elevate the cleric in the order of chosing.<P>Maybe a few spells against undead only, debuffs. I don't know, I don't play a cleric myself and cannot for the life of me think what else your class is supposed to do. From my point of view, you provide great healing and rez's for when things go wrong. Nothing else really, as your AC/HP buffs are nice but by no means mandatory like a good haste/slow. Come to think of it, its got to the point where most clerics I end up grouping with don't even bother buffing, they just go straight to med and throw out the heals when it is required.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Our narrowed abilities has made it easier for clerics to be replaced by shammies, and druids, and in some cases preferred over us.<P>The only answer to that is when (and trust me it does) things go wrong and that shammie and warrior start sending tells out for a rez, all you need to do is say "sure I will rez ya, got room for a cleric in your group?"<P>That is a polite way of saying you may need us more than you think.. Sure at level 60 the exp loss may not be that important, as most are working on AA, but I would say that most of the tanks and shammies out there are not wanting to loose a whole orange of exp. either. <P>The biggest problem EQ has made for all classes, is the overlapping abilities of all of us.. In the cleric's case though, our soloing abilities are not anyways close to most classes, and our duo grouping for exp. has come into question now.. Our biggest contribution is now in the raid formatt, and that does get old day in and day out complete healing and rezzing, with little or no experience, and in many cases competition with all the other plate and melee users for the rare drops that may greatly improve a tank, but marginally improve a cleric.  <P>Dusklar 60th High Priest of Prexus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I know this is a low level example but I think it illustrates the point clearly.<P>We are very helpful after a problem erupts, or blows over.  We are great at mass healing, large healing, and rezing.  We bring people back from disaster well.  But we aren't that great at averting it all together (or not better than other classes)<P>Two days ago I was in the Overthere looking for a group.  I was turned down by a couple of groups (none of which had a cleric at all).  This wasn't hard to take as I figured I would be picked up soon.<P>Well about 20 minutes later I get a tell from one of the groups that turned me down asking if I could come rez their group from a wipeout.<P>Now, I had to ask them why now he decided he needed my skills and not before.  I could have helped and possibly avoided the problem. But either way since you didn't get me then you will all pay 100pp for my assistance now. My services come free to group members but not to others especially ones that flatly deny me enterance into a non full group because I wasn't needed.<P>We are seen as clean up and wanted for our skills that help when things go bad.  No one wants to think that things will go bad on plain exp groups though, and for that we suffer.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>For a lot of people, raiding is EQ.<P>For a level 60 raiding cleric, introducing variety in our raid abilities and breaking the monotony of our niche would be desirable. Making the cleric role in high end game a bit more non-linear, would also be desirable.<P>Asides from raiding, why not try to make the class a bit more fun to play?<P>Making our heals more fun, without necessarily making them more powerful would be desirable. Why not make point blank AE heals that work like AE nukes do on mobs? The amount healed, and spell refresh time could be tweaked to insure it's not "unballancing". Why not make a new heal type that works like rain AE damage spells do? Heal in certain location for a few turns, up to 4 PC targets. Why not directional Wall of Healing type heal? It would work like mage projectile nukes, just would be a wall of blue particles that passes through people and heals for certain amount within certain range.<P>Why not give us invis and levitation? How come every damn caster class has invis, and we don't? Even *warrior* can invis themselves and *other people* through the use of cobalt pants, but not cleric... Every caster class can lev themselves, but not cleric.<P>Enchancing grouping ability for cleric at level 10, does nothing for a large customer base that are already past this point.<P>I did my time, I stuck with it for 60 levels, now gimme mah damn cookie.  <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif"><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>smegal, your in after life? arnt you supposed to be uber or something? how about putting the smack down on the stupid casters getting agro and requiring bigger heals? Schatze is right.. a bigger heal just ensures a dead cleric. <P>as for mor, I usualy dont have trouble casting it earliy and waiting a few seconds for MT to get agro. Maybe the melee persons your fighting with should start either useing taunt, useing spells to taunt, or useing specific weapons that have high taunt. its pretty nice in that it does do as much as our high end nuke (maybe more if the mob last a while) and cost less to cast.<P>as for anyone picking a shaman over us, I cant say i have ever run into a group that was in a descent exp spot and didnt have a cleric, nore wanted one because they had a shaman. shaman torpor is like a cleric living off celestial heal, and we know that dosnt work. a tank with 4k hp buffed can put a cleric lom with celestial heal, and at the same time the shaman is casting haste, and mana gulping slow. watch him go oom with a couple resist. theres just no way a good exp group can deal with just a shaman. and you can forget a druid as main healer.<P>------------------<BR>---<P><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32524" TARGET=_blank>Magelo Profile</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Luminar<P>Read my post again about MoR - please.<P>I was with a monk (Gharns Rock, Primal, 41% haste item + epic) and a Mage (Epic pet and Velk boots).<P>I cast MoR on inc or as part of me pulling with others hits on to specifically count how often the monk got hit with only the monk and mage killing and with me not nuking at all to get as possitive a result as possible. <P>The result? On 10 mobs or so I got on average a little *less* dmg/mana than Reckoning produces if it hits for max - and I got more aggro because I to cast early. Both MoR and Reckoning can get resisted so I will consider that as cancelling out.<P>Now consider the following:<BR>The ratio would have been worse <BR>- If I had not cast right away<BR>- if the group had been larger <BR>- if the mobs had been slowed<BR>The ratio would have been better: <BR>+ if the mobs had a higher hit percentage (monks in NToV gear dont get hit much)<BR>+ If the mobs had had more hp and hence lasted longer<P>That said - I dont think MoR is worth much in anything but a slow killing (be it small or just lacking in power) group unless you fight unslowed mobs with fairly high hp. I could see that with an epic pet + a NToV/ST equipped monk for damage 8k hp mobs in Akheva just died too fast and missed too often.<P>I am looking forward to seeing actual parse results though = #hits mob makes on average per successfully landed MoR. I reckon I can try to gather some data and I hope you will too.<P>Empirical data >> gut feelings   <IMG SRC="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 03-15-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>Some of the posts on this board completely boggle my mind.  I have a couple comments.<P>Smegal - of course I agree with him.<P>Schatze - I am so bitter right now about cleric abilities outside of raiding, it's hard for me to express...but I still strongly disagree with you.  I'd be thrilled to get a new, effective heal.  My dream would be a group CE, but I'm told "they" don't like that idea.<P>Lumenar - There are other circumstances surrounding the need to actually heal a caster from time to time besides their lack of skill (or whatever you may have been implying).  Thank goodness it's rare for me to have to heal one...because it sucks with the heals I normally have memorized.  And saying that greater heals just make dead clerics... How much greater can you get than CH?  We are talking about something better than DL.  It's ridiculous we haven't gotten an upgrade to that.<P>Jan - I really hate to disagree with you on MoR...I usually agree with your comments.  But, in practice I have found this to be one of my favorite spells.  I can cast it quickly, and it lands most of the time right away.  Yes, it does get resisted, but really not that often.  In fact, the only mob I can think of that I haven't been able to land it on yet is Tunare.  Also, from a clerical standpoint...I really didn't become a cleric to nuke...I quit playing a wizard to become a cleric in fact...so casting MoR on a mob is much more satisfying than landing a nuke - to me anyway.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Arele" TARGET=_blank>Arele Nyxx</A> - <BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org" TARGET=_blank>Afterlife</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>I dont know who you all group with, but my regualar parter is a shaman.  Yes, I dont add too much, as he is a solo GOD, but when it gets close, I either turn it around or clean up the mess afterwards with a rez.  <P>My shaman does NOT like to play primary healer.  Know why? Because they have so much OTHER things they could be doing.  Think of it like this: You have a tank that engages a mob but only kicks.

Currently I spam Remedy or DL and cross my fingers.<P>I dont know about you guys but the ONLY reason I dont get groups is because there is 6 other clerics sitting there LFG.

</FONT><HR>Ok, if you have a tank with 1400 ac and 5000 hps then chances are that they might have their own willsapper and eyepatch of plunder, as well as primal weapon for avatar.  Its usually pretty easy to just get a friendly enchanter to cast vog on the tank which will last quite a while, just as one could get a aego fairly easily from a friendly cleric.  Saying that a tank would rather group with a shamen, well, if you want that shamen to be oom constantly and have large downtime maybe.  Take sseru for example.  I regularly partner with a tank who has unbuffed 4550 hp's and 1380 ac.  Sometimes I group with a shamen as well, but chances are more than once I'm emergency healing him if he aggros too soon.  With the speed that we pull, there is simply no way that a shamen could keep up.  <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=24725" TARGET=_blank>Aiyre Soulfyre</A> <BR>High Priest</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Got to admit, I have been seeing a huge problem here recently. Went to shroom king in OS with a bunch of 59/60s... I was meleeing 90% of the time because there was nothing else for me to do except CH once every 2 or 3 mobs. I could have gated and they would have handled it just fine, easily even. Even though I put together the group, I felt embarrassed at how little I could contribute to offense. The melees I was with weren't particularly uber either, pretty much average for what I would expect for players of their class/level.<P>Give me Flame Strike goddammit!

We don't kill AoW or Tunare, but every one of our warriors has his epics, all but one or two weild primal weapons, all are in full Skyshrine armor or better, have willsappers, eyepatches, et cetera, and we're just ONE of four guilds on our server who can boast this or better.  This isn't exceptional.  This is the standard for the end-game.<P>And in the end-game, clerics are XP leeches.  As long as there is a Fungus Grove or a Chardok, people aren't going to hunt in the tougher zones for their AA points.

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with Cali.  I also have a 55 shaman who was my main until recently.  If you ever ask a shaman to be main healer they will not like the idea.  Slow still cause a huge amount of aggro and usually if I am the only healer as a shaman, I end up dead.<P>As my cleric I do have a hard time looking for a group.  The reasons I feel this is  because I was not on at the right time and they had to take a shaman or a druid over a cleric cause there was not any other healers on at the time.  They fill up the group and they are not about to kick out the other healers because a cleric logged in.  <P>Another thing I have noticed is that in places like Velk there are about 5 clerics looking for group at zone.  This is true, but I also noticed that there are many other clerics in zone already in a group.  Two clerics in one group is just as much of a waste as two shamans or two druids or two enchanters.  <P>For months the cleric was the most wanted class and many people made the cleric because they thought they would have no problems getting into groups.  Just like there was that time where everyone made a rogue and after everyone made an enchanter.  In the end game a lot more clerics are needed then any other class.  Guilds are pushing for clerics and there are a huge creation of cleric "bots".  (bot = a character played on a second account who's functions are set up by macro's)   <P>I feel that the reason why the exp grind year of a cleric life is hard because the end game demands so much of them.  If the end game did not require clerics to be the most needed class in a raid then more people will not feel the need to make cleric alts on another account.<P>Edit: spelling <p>[This message has been edited by Chaldaea (edited 03-18-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>In the upper-30's, nobody wants a Cleric if they can get a Druid or a Shaman.<HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>LOL!  I recently started playing my cleric because I'm just not getting to heal much with my druid (lvl 41) anymore in exp groups, and I miss healing.  I've also been impressed at just how well a cleric can heal and still have mana left over to do other things.  Every group I've ever been in post level 25ish  that didn't have a cleric to heal, was looking for one.  Even right after I got greater healing, the group still would rather have a cleric healing.  The only time I heal in a group now is when our cleric has left and we haven't found another one yet.  Unless I have enchanter buffs on, I can't keep up with healing at all without horrendous downtime.  With enchanter buffs I can limp along provided the mobs don't hit too hard.  <P>One of the problems with getting Aaexp at level 60 as a cleric is there are more level 60 clerics than any other class besides maybe warriors, just take a look at the roster of any high end guild.  Sure  some of these are second account bots, but I'm sure many of them are also trying to get aaexp as well.<P>I absolutely believe that 60 meleers who've been raiding for a long time are overpowered for wimpy exp fights but I still can't see what meleer would want a 60 druid partner over a 60 cleric anyway, cleric heals are so much more efficient, thus less downtime.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>To those in the end game who prefer shamans or whatever,to a Cleric.Consider this.Next time you send a level 60 Cleric a tell for a rez and he refuses,it's because you passed him up when he was LFG.Don't look at him as an XP leech,look at him as Life Insurance.I'm only level 35 atm.I symbol almost everyone in the groups that I join.I have a small group of friends that group together.However,I am constantly LFG at this level.As Drakov or whoever said,most groups are happy with the Shaman's buffs/slows/DoT's/heals.But if you asked the shaman he would probably prefer a dedicated healer.Second,those clerics you climbed over to the top are looking at getting the higher level rez's also.If you pass them up in your XP group do you really think that they are going to be there in the End-game? I think not.Most of your post 50 Clerics are tired of being asked to come along only on Raids.I have several high-level cleric friends who only log on their Cleric for raids and spend their down-time on Alts.Why? Because you would rather your Shaman friend heal and buff you.<BR>I agree that we need buffs that are stackable with other classes.I'm tired of trying to buff a group and wasting mana,only to find out they only need symbol.Getting the message "your spell would not have taken hold on your target"infuriating.<BR>Next time you die,ask your Shaman buddy for a rez=)<BR>/flame on</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>the reasons I'd like to see clerics get a new heal upgrade to DL is where as we are teh masters of healign in so mutch as we have Cheal the other healign classes only LACK really that heal on us and in some cases have better heals, Eg, teh shamn or druid or both DL equive has a longer range then DL, healign about the same, druids shamsn get remady spell, Shams and opally get REALLY eficent HoT's torpor and Celestial clensing.  This i why I'd liek to see clerics get a new better heal to once agaion make us teh TRUE masters of healing no if ands or buts, thats our job that what we shoudl do the best buy a long shot not just one lv 39 spell.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Venerable Netorbesnom Spellbinder,<BR>High Priest of the Companions, The Tribunal.<BR> <A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12138" TARGET=_blank>http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=12138</A> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>If I knew I would need a lot of heals, then I would have a cleric, but 9 times out of 10, a good group can function on minimal heals. Even chain pulling.<P>But your right, I do look for exp in the easiest, safest possible places. Cause I don't like dieing for some stupid little piece of exp.<P>If I must die somewhere it will be on a raid to get loot. So if some cleric does getting touchy about not being in my group and me needing a rez, well stuff that cleric, I would gladly pay for a rez, but if they refuse then I will get my exp back the hard way.<P>Doesn't change my opinion of who is needed in a simple exp group post 50.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>Arele<P>I agree that MoR owns - for hard mobs that last a while. <P>I was referring to (easy) exp mobs with a fast killing group. I did a few tests (http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000628.html) which I invite you to look at and comment on wrt MoR for exping. I would be happy to find greater use for MoR - but for exping I cannot seem to - so any suggestions are most welcome.<P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264" TARGET=_blank>Mikar of the Nexus</A><BR>High Priest of Brell<BR><A HREF="http://companions.windsofstorm.net/" TARGET=_blank>The Companions</A><BR>The Tribunal<p>[This message has been edited by JanSorensen (edited 03-18-2002).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#dedfdf">

</FONT><HR>I experience like..oh..never.  When I did, it was usually with one melee (rogue or sometimes a bard), so the MoR was helpful. <P>I have also found it useful in tough fights when it's just me, rogue, monk, bard.  But we tend to try things most smaller groups wouldn't.  Imagine fighting 2 or 3 tough mobs.  I can land MoR on all of them while they are slowly being killed one at a time.  By the time they get to the second, it's down a good 20% due to all the DS.  By the time they get to the third, it could be down to 50% or sometimes more from the DS.  In those situations, it really shows.  Plus, there is almost never any aggro from casting.  <P>I do agree in exp grind groups the MoR would be useless since the mobs would die too quickly.  But, in the right situations...it's a terrific little spell. <P>------------------<BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org/members.cgi?page=details&character=Arele" TARGET=_blank>Arele Nyxx</A> - <BR><A HREF="http://www.afterlifeguild.org" TARGET=_blank>Afterlife</A></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#f7f7f7">

</FONT><HR>>>>In the upper-30's, nobody wants a Cleric if they can get a Druid or a Shaman.<<<<P>This just isn't the case.<P>In the pre 50 game, a Druid or shammy can do it but a Cleric is prefered. I have a 55 Druid and 49 Monk and my memories of the 30s and 40s are that we always wanted a Cleric for Main healer but frequently had to make do with a Druid because we couldn't find a Cleric.  We would even hold a spot open for a while but when no Clerics are found, we would fill it with something else that would complement the Druid healing like a bard/chanter/necro/shammy/another druid.<P>Last night with my Monk in Dreadlands, we had a group formed up and all we needed was a healer.  No clerics but some Dr00ds (their LFG message said Dr00d) but they wouldn't join us if they had to main heal.  I told the leader I was against them being in our group even if we got another healer.  <P>I have leveled my Cleric up to 20 now and in Lake of Ill Omen, I log on and get tells frequently asking me to group.  Sure they can get a 19 Druid to do heals with the same spell but I can do it better and I would frequently get asked to join camps with harder MOBs that would make a druid cry (it made me cry when I was there).<P>>>I'm level 40 now and, for the most part, still just duo-ing with my friend's Ranger... sometimes getting a third person.<<<P>Pre 50, Clerics are in demand and I have only been in a groups that did without because we couldn't get one.  You walk into DL, you should be able to get a group quick.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="" face="Verdana, Arial"></font></P></td></tr></table><table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial">This topic is 3 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008132-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008132-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/Forum1/HTML/008132-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008132&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=008132&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
