I think that last night i may have found the fun and challanging answer for where to get the xp from.<br />
<br />
Solb and Lguk are always camped, right?  Last night, low guk was so camped on povar that the hall spawns were being competed for.   Needless to say, the tower was fairly safe to move around in.   <br />
<br />
So, i root/nuke froggies.  safe from trains because of the over population, clarity and chloroplast easily accessable from the other peep's in the zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ailamil Faithbringer</div><div class="date">11-10-1999, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's how I got outta 47 last night!   At 47 you can pull solo blue from a distance.  I was able to clear my way to the savant room and hold it by pulling them solo.  At 48, most of the stuff to zols will be green (icluding the savant, the assasin, the supplier, the ritualist, maybe the cav, sage, scribe- didn't get a chance to check on those .  The executioner should be blue still).  So using them to get outta 47 might take awhile.<br />
<br />
The best way to get outta 47 is to do bugs in Sol B.  I grouped with another cleric (50), 2 tanks (48 and 50), an enchanter (50) and a wiz (mid 40).  Constant pulling, great exp, set of black chilten legs, a green silk drape, and a golden chilten bracer later - I was silver away from 48 (almost 3 bubs in just over 6 hours).<br />
<br />
Alternately, sit in the Hand room, pull the hand room, AM room, and everything up to the Ghoul Lord.  Great exp there.<br />
<br />
On the live side, the fork can be great exp too.  Sit at the entrance and clear the top, then the Yun Priest, then the hallways, then the Crusader.  You can sit either at the top of the fort or the bottom and pull everything.  Hardly anyone is ever there and it's wonderful exp (not to mention those silver plated legs are nice, as is the runed mith tunic)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traturn</div><div class="date">11-10-1999, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok,so back to guk again last night.   let me tune my experiences a little.<br />
<br />
<br />
at levl 47, some wan's are green.... i still got noticable xp movement off killing one.   blue wan's and zol's definate xp movement killing a single mob.<br />
<br />
ranging from the assassin to the hand room I killed mobs.  Fighting in the tunnel at the drop point, or cav room hall worked well.  really any spot with room to root and run out of range in order to nuke.<br />
<br />
3 hrs playing i got 1.5 bub xp, without dying.  it seems like a pretty good pace to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
with FH/FM, i can handle 2 wizzies or 2 wan's ( granted things go well ).  a zol tends to take a bunch of mana, about 6 banish necessary.<br />
<br />
Call me crazy, but it seems like Great xp from this side of the keyboard.   best part is it's fun and challanging too.<br />
<br />
1/2 bub to levl, i'll tell you what it's like in 48.<br />

I mostly hunted in the Sol room in Sol B and in the hand or frenzied area of Guk at high 40s. Kedge wasnt an option then but now its a great place for exp and some really nice items too. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badaf</div><div class="date">11-11-1999, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres not a doubt in my mind the best place for you to go. I went from 47 to 50 there in relativly short amount of time. <br />
Seafury cyclops in OOT.<br />
 Heres some of the many pluses about it:<br />
In the open. <br />
So very few or no trains.<br />
Sow if someone can cast it.<br />
Exps:<br />
Exps per mob is good or better than bats, LDC, and beetles.<br />
Spawn time. <br />
The 5-6 clops spawn on the island with a respawn time of 5 minutes! Plus  the cyclops that hold the ancient cyclops is close by as well as Gornit the Hill giant. 2 groups can pull cyclops constantly. even with 3 groups theres usually always one up. And in my 3 levels there there was never 3 full groups pulling.  So constant pulls!<br />
Loot:<br />
Average to very good loot. clops have about 5 plat in change and often drop rare gems (fire emeralds, fire opals, star rubies, sapphires) and jewelry (worth from approx 40 plat to 90 plat!).<br />
No wanders. <br />
While all the cyclops wander. There are several areas on the islands where the cyclops dont wander so you only have to worry about more than one joining in when you are pulling. <br />
Difficulty: To me these are much easier that bat or bugs. Me and a 49th levl mage with earth pet can pull constantly!...usually it takes one complete heal on the pet per cyclops. Also me and a 50th level warrior could pull pretty much non-stop. A 3 man team should do fine.<br />
Downsides:<br />
No zoning. But with little chance of training this is not much of a problem. Unless you are a caster banking can be bother. But since the clops dont drop anythinng heavy its not much of a big deal.<br />
No &quot;good stuff&quot;. <br />
Theres not any high level magic loot cept for the rare ancient cyclops.<br />
Quag Maelstorm.<br />
His a named 45th (i think) level clops and hes mean. He cast a drain mana spell, has alot more hps and hits very hard. Recommend 2 tanks. <br />
Need to take boat. <br />
So evils have a slightly tougher time getting there. <br />
All in all this place is was an undiscovered gem on my server. I was hesitant to even mention it here cause its just that good. I HIGHLY recommed giving it a go. Definatly a refreshing break from the stuffy, crowded dungeons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traturn</div><div class="date">11-17-1999, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, good xp solo in guk )<br />
<br />
wans turn greener 1/2 way through 48, i stopped killing everyone i saw, and tried to go after zol's/dar's/wizzies.<br />
<br />
zol's need about 5 or 6 banish, dar's need way too many, more than i got mana, but with crackrock, no sweat.... dead dar's.<br />
<br />
double teamed with a shaman, kept me regen'd (as good as clarity sometimes) and got a lot more meding in dot killing the greenies, therefor more zol's.<br />
<br />
i used straightup root to do this.  now that i got immobilize, i'll use root still )<br />
