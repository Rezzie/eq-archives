<br />
The reason I ask is yesterday in VP, I was toying with resists.  First time I had 300+ resists and never resisted Silverwings chaotic flux.  First time I met her I had 190 and resisted every one of them.  Now, we proceed to Phar Dar,  She casts a stun,  People with 250+ rm got stuned with me at 188 rm resisted all of them.  Honestly I think ester and VI's programmers have their heads up their arses but with under 200 rm or any other resist I seem to resist more than if I had higher.  Thoughts, Ideas?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dalain</div><div class="date">04-09-2001, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally think it's almost luck.  I've been in bard groups with 200+ and 250+ resists and resisted things fine in VP, and I've been in non-bard groups with my resists between 190-220 and resisted things fine.  This last VP run for Phara Dar I was at 217 MR and I resisted all the stuns.  But at 217 for Druushk I only resisted the AE 1 of 3.  I personally don't think it hurts to be over 250, but I also don't think it helps at all either.  I'd almost say that much over 190 doesn't seem to help much, but I also don't think it hurts.  I certainly haven't run much tests, but these are my observations from the 4 times I've done VP.  It would be hard to test since you need a dragon type AE and I think more then 2 meetings of SW to get a good idea if 250+ resists hurt or not.  Your first SW encounter could have been just bad luck.  *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<br />
I run about a 190 MR and have been gfluxed three times in about twenty Silverwing kills. Phara has stunned me twice in the 9 times we fought her.<br />
<br />
Last Phara fight I dropped a Celestial Elixir on the puller as he came by, she decided to charm me. So I spent about 45 seconds meleeing our Iksar warlord while the guild laughed at me  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
