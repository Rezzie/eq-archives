<br />
Broon in East Karana - recommended party: you and a tank type. If no one is camping Proon, don't sit there twiddling your thumbs, ZONE quickly, or he will slaughter you. He gets a little ticked when you kill Broon. Best place to fight him: waters edge near the wood bridge - allows easy zoning afterwards. Note: this is where he will end up after wandering - his actual spawn point is near the base of the ramp to High Hold Keep. Tactics: standard melee battle - heal / med / buff etc..<br />
<br />
Slaythe in Misty Thicket: Recommended party: You and a tank type. At 24 you could probably solo him, but the downtime is just too much. Note - he will spawn when you go to a halfling thief on top of one of the wall towers and say ' What small favor' Bronin is his name. Slaythe will instantly spawn by a big stump off to the right of the wall gate, in the thicket - way off near the far side of the zone. Best tactics: bind at stump, run to tower, phrase spawn Slaythe, gate to stump, practice 1hb/2hb on him till partner needs a heal, then heal / med till he is dead. Good buff for group is resist fire ( plus all hp ac ones) Slaythe casts aoe Drake Breath. Don't med too close or it will hit you too.<br />
As soon as you are ready to fight again, run and spawn him.<br />
<br />
Goblin Mines in Lake of Ill Omen, Kunark - there are 2 entrances to these mines, one is a less guarded one with blue Warriors, blue / white Soothsayers (shamans), white / yellow Warlords. Generally the entrance is guarded by one at a time, respawn type of mob is random - can get any of the above.. The main entrance has more mobs at it, cant really pull one at a time with out a ranger / druid or the like.. Warriors / warlords are standard melee types, all are fairly resistant to root, be prepared to cast it multiple times till it sticks. Soothsayers or their upgraded cousins, spirit casters or something (white cons) cast drowsy, low level dots, cold based dd's - either do the crap buff / cancel magic tactic to get rid of drowsy, or chain stun it thru the fight so it can't cast. Hotkey Stun to nail it as soon as it starts to cast. <br />
<br />
Various wandering skeletal types near undead ruins in Lake of Ill Omen con blue ( some green) Seemed to resist Expell undead alot though  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/frown.gif <br />
<br />
Giant Skeletons in Rathe Mountains - blue / white, yellow and red cons here - wide range of spawn levels. Carefull pulling - heh make the tank do it - you might get a cyclops if you aren't careful - always be courteous and shout Train as you run for the zone. I fought these just to the left or right of the corridor to Lake Rathe - mini zone corners.<br />
Standard melee type, and you can bring your undead DD to bear too - just let the tank do enough damage first to offset your DD so it wont go for you instead..<br />
<br />
As you can see I don't like to fight in dungeon / train prone spots, and I usually fight in a group of 2, but that's just me..<br />
<br />
Will post more spots as I try them.<br />
