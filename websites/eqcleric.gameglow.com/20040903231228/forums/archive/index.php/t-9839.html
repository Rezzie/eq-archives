<br />
My guild (yeah, all 6 of us) decided we would head off to Chardok.<br />
<br />
Our ranger had been there before and knew his way around.<br />
<br />
So we zoned in (that's the zone where the exit vanishes when you zone in, you have to go all the way around) and got set up.  We found some blue stuff to kill, lots of hp, we were having fun.  <br />
<br />
Eventually we figured we'd better head to the actual zone just in case.  So off we went.  There, parked at the exit, were several members of a large guild on our server, Prophecy.<br />
<br />
They not only told us we couldn't sit there, they told us we should go back where we were.<br />
<br />
I didn't want a fight, so we headed back.  More of their guild were arriving (almost all 51+).  <br />
<br />
A minute or two later, they trained us.  They made sure they got about 8 of the biggest things in there, ran them by us, then gated out.<br />
<br />
Fortunately no one died - we evaced when we saw what they were doing.<br />
<br />
I would like to express my thanks to the 4 clerics who were present in that guild.  You were rude, snobby, and thought you owned the whole dungeon because you'd been there &quot;all day.&quot;  We were not rude to you, we asked if you wanted to join up and help each other out.  You were jerks.  All of you.  If any of your guild (and boy are there a lot of em) ever needs my guild's assistance, I will regretfully inform them that they will receive no assistance from us because of the atrocious acts of their guildmates.<br />
<br />
I won't name names, I think they know who they are.  I assume they got that cocky from being in the planes.  God have mercy on anyone trying to get there when they were &quot;owning&quot; it.</div></div><hr />

Not saying that the guild mentioned definately does that, because I don't even play on the same server with them.<br />
<br />
But it is a shame when it does happen, and some big guilds do get this arrogant.<br />

Im in a good size guild with almost 100 active members.  We hold people accountable for crap like this.  We hunt every thurs and<br />
just about every week there is someone in my group who is not in our guild, we invite everyone that is there to join in the fun.<br />
<br />
Here is my rant to your rant.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have the nerve to train people or tell them to get out of your zone then you should have your named posted here.<br />
<br />
Telling us that 4 clerics were jerks doesnt do a single thing.   Being given the names can help someone else avoid one of these jerks.<br />
<br />
Last night my guild got together for PVP night in FP.  All of the people there were level 22 and bellow.  Some idiot Wiz named &quot;TOMB&quot; level 48 sat invis in the arena and started nuking a druid and paly that started to duel.  He wouldn't stop even when we ask him nicely, as there was nobody his level here to duel.  This guy left soon after he got tells form all 30 of us on and is on all of our dont group or bail this guy out list.  He wasted all of our time cause he was bored and wanted to be cruel.<br />
<br />
Please dont feel like you cant name names because that makes you the better person, that imho is a crock.  If you are a jerk and try to get people kiled you deserve to be named as such.  I can understand why you dont want to name names but I think you should because people need to be held accountable for their actions.<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope you dont run into these idiots again.<br />

I say you go back in there, and start to /log everything.  And then hope that those people do it again.  If they do, it is a direct and flagrant violation of the Play Nice policy, no one, uber-guild or not, can own a spawn, let alone a whole zone.  They will be FORCED to let you guys have your own space/spawns.  <br />
<br />
Power to the individual, death to uberguilds!!!!<br />

I don't know what tone they were talking to you in but maybe they were saying &quot;you might not want to be here because we are pulling some really nasty mobs to zone&quot;<br />
<br />
There a lot of times when my guild will rally together to take down some nasty mobs that would get a party of 6 taken down.<br />
<br />
Did you think that maybe you were infringing on thier camp area - Play Nice Policy is a 2 way street.<br />
<br />
I don't know what happened between the 2 groups I wasn't there... So were only getting one side of the story - who knows...<br />
