<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cael</div><div class="date">06-04-2000, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight my level 51 monk friend died in Dalnir, so I helped him go do CR.   He said he was at full health, ran through some mobs to the zone out, but instead of zoning out, he found himself dead.  He didn't know what killed him so fast.   We started going through the dungeon, and the mobs inside were very easy, nothing hitting for more than 70 hp.   I was puzzled what could have killed him inside.   We got to the zone out, and an 'overseer' was up, so I pulled it.  It was just like any other mob in there (ie, green trash), then suddenly I just died.  I was at full health, had heroism, and symbol of mazrim on, so I had about 2200 hp.  Something he cast did over 2200 hp damage.  We want back in for another CR mission, and engaged this mob again.   This time he died like the other mobs inside.   <br />
<br />
I'm curious...anyone else have a similiar experience with this overseer?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vanje</div><div class="date">06-04-2000, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My partner and I have a lot of experience with this guy  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif  The Overseer is the place holder for The Kly, which is the npc the drops the Necklace of Superiority.  Both of them have some very nasty attacks and if you get close to either one of them you may find yourself dying very quickly indeed.<br />
<br />
Our practice has been to chain-stun him while the other member(s) go about doing what they normally do in any situation. Having 4 stuns up, I rarely had to heal anyone in my group during the fight. <br />
<br />
It turned out to be an extremely long and tedious camp but the reward was well worth it!  (I had to refuse a trade offer for a PKT since I didn't want to do the camp again lol  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/biggrin.gif ) <br />
<br />
Just so you know, my partner is a necro and we were both around 45 when we started this camp. I've also heard that mage pets that stun and/or root work well.<br />
<br />
Good luck if you decide to persue The Kly  http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />
