Below are the 'official changes' made to Feign Death:<br><br>
<i>
Feign Death was recently changed by the Tuning Team to reflect evolving gameplay issues.  Since two of the three classes that get Feign Death get it through spells, I thought this might be a good place to explain the changes.
<br>
Previously, when you used Feign Death (and assuming you cast the spell successfully or, in the case of the Monk, made your skill roll) hostile monsters would decided that you were dead and wander off.  When you later got up, they would still remember that they were angry with you.  If you were within sight, they would immediately come after you.  If not, they would come after you at some later point.  This might happen within a few minutes, or could happen even a few hours later.  The only way to be absolutely sure that a monster had forgotten about you was to zone.
<br>
With our new changes, about a third of the time that you successfully Feign Death, the monster will immediately forget about you, similar to an Enchanter casting Memory Blur.  If they do NOT forget about you, they will immediately come after you when you stand up.  No more monsters coming back at irregular amounts of time - it should be immediate or not at all.
<br>
This is a change - the old way, if you Feigned Death a SINGLE TIME, the monster would ALWAYS  remember you.  This way, they remember you about two-thirds of the time.
<br>
Using the old Feign Death, you could Feign Death multiple times to try to confuse the monster.  After about seven or eight times doing this, most monsters would eventually forget they were mad at you. 
<br>
With the new Feign Death, if you Feign Death once the monster has about a 65 percent chance of remembering you.  Twice and the monster has about a 50 percent chance of remembering you.  Four times means about 20 percent, and six times means about 8 percent.  This is very similar to the old Feign Death.
<br>
Another addition to the new Feign Death involves a monster "going home."  When you Feign Death, most monsters will return to where they were before the fight.  If a monster returns to its initial location, it will immediately forget about you greater then 90 percent of the time.  Therefore, if you Feign Death and stay down long enough for a monster to "go home," you should be safe when you stand up a majority of the time.  If the monster IS still mad at you, it will return immediately, rather then wandering back later at some irregular interval.
</i><br><br>
Essentially, this means Feign Pulling is no longer going to be anywhere near as effective as it used to be.  However, this will not affect Necromancer's as much as Monks.  Necro's will still hold a much better soloing ability in dungeons due to these changes, however it will not be quite the same.<br>
However, this may or may not affect Necromancer's astounding ability to solo in dungeons.  Further testing will be needed to determine this.

This appears to have been added after the previous message:<br><br>
<i>
After further testing and watching these changes on the Live verses the Test Server, we will bechanging Feign Death again on the next patch. 
<br>
New changes will make it so that if the creature is less than level 35, the monster will always forget about you. If the creature greater then level 35, then the monster will use the changes detailed above. </i>
<br><br>
This change appears to me aimed at high level dungeon hunting, yet aiding the lower levels by returning Feign Death to its previous state.

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">New Necro Quest</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
There is a new quest in the Rathe Mountains given <b>only</b> to Level 50 Players.  Details are sketchy, but it appears to be a quest aimed at SKs, with a side item of great benefit to Necromancers.  A necklace (+7INT, +7WIS) can be gotten by completing part of this quest.  If you have any details on this, please <a href="mailto:faust@doomguild.com">mail me</a>.

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
In the next few issues you will see a new breed of article, something I think every Necromancer will enjoy.<br>
-There will be detailed how-to's of how to accomplish certain feats, including many Screenshots and detailed walk-through's.  These will of course be major spoilers.  The first one will be how to duo Allizewsaur with two L50 Necromancers, and how to solo it following soonafter.<br>
-More to follow will be how to solo the named spawns in Guk, do quests, and more.<br>
-Guides on making Necros, race comparisons, and more.
