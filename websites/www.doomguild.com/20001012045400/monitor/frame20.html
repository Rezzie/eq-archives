Greetings..<br><br>
As I was hunting in Guk tonight Nexia was kind enough to give me a copy of Words of Collection (Beza).  I had previosuly acquired Words of Obligation from a Guk Knight, and was eager to research the 44th level pet.  Much to my dismay, I got the same error message as the last time I had tried, about a week prior.  Upon contacting Guide Casiopiea, she eventually told me that it was, indeed working.  Nexia then attempted to research it twice, and alas got the 'do not combine' message both times.<br><br>
Obviously, I was quite angered at this, both the pets being nerfed again, and the GM (Zatoria) either having bad information, or more likely providing false information to the guide.  I will be posting a copy of this on Newsgroups and EQVault's forums, as well emailing this info to both EQ News sites.  Unfortunately there isn't much more I can say, except once again Necros have been nerfed.<br><br>

Since the most recent patch has been made to the live servers, I, along with many Necros have noticed our resists rates have skyrocketed.  On the average, it has become apparent that Necros are definitely being resisted more <b>while</b> grouped, and enjoying the same resist rate as ungrouped.  Along with the recent kiting changes, this has made playing a Necro by far one of the hardest classes in the game to play.<br><br>
I strongly suggest that the Necromancer Community send Geoff Zarkin a well thought out, clearly worded email expressing our disgust at these unannounced changes.<br><br>
Reach him at <a href="mailto:GZatkin@Verant.com">GZatkin@Verant.com</a>.

According to * GM * Xentrix of the Xegony Server, the Staff of Undead Legions will be fully functional after the next patch.  I'm not holding breath..<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
The Level 44 Pet Research Recipe (Words of Obligation, Words of Collection Beza) is NERFED!  Do NOT attempt to research this spell, as you WILL lose your words!  More to come..
<br><br>

<b>Addendum</b>:  I have received several emails stating that Words of Cazia are indeed the correct words for the L44 pet spell.  Sorry for the error.  However, it troubles me that the GM obviously gave me a form response to my inquiries about this, which is even more disappointing than the spell being broken.<br><br>

<b>Repost</b>:<br><br>
<i>- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage.</i><br>
Does this mean their ability to tank has been lessened?  Also does it affect Mages?  Please let me know!<br><br>
<i>- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better.</i><br>
I'll believe it when I see it.<br><br>
There are scattered reports that the L39 and the L34 pets have also been nerfed by this patch, however I can neither confirm nor discredit these rumors.  If you've any information please let me know.

<b>Ignite Bones</b>:<br><br>
Ignite Bones is the 'coup de gras' of the Necro DDs, as it were.  At least for non-undeads.  It is a fire based spell, costing 210 mana to cast.  It can be acquired at all or most Necro guilds, and is scribable at Level 44.  The spell does an initial 494 Direct Damage, as well as turns the target into a skeletal form.  However, this does <b>not</b> make the target an undead target!<br>
Due to its dual effect, this spell will be resisted more than any other utility spell around these levels.  In addition to this drawback, there is approximately a 10 second recast time on this spell.<br><br>
