			<BR>I'm sick and tired of the bullshit in EQ, I made level 41 (and halfway to 42) last wednesday (just for the record, and easily rip up to 50 in about 2 weeks if I kept to slamming those level 40ish guards).<P>And that night I decided to take a step back from EQ, and see what I have become.. I play at the whims of the poor service and unfair gameplay..<P>example : who fucking cares about not disapearing right away when you go linkdead...  this isn't some sort of ultra important thing.. if someone goes linkdead 99% of the time it would be because of the bullshit servers being overpacked..<P>another example : the guides.. they are totally useless.. and are supposed to use they're own judgement when helping players out with problems.. this is a game after all, and if you are making players suffer, you are not doing your job, and secondly we are paying customers<P>one more quick point : Verant should create some sort of lan option for EQ, because I would much rather play with a bunch of friends and customize the world/quests myself then play with the 1000s of idiots online.<P>the only way i'd play online again, would be if there was some sort of strict screening for players.. like make one very strict rp only server, and no retarded names like "jarjarbinks" or other bullcrap like that... and if the guides were actually a little more intelligent on that server. <P>Hm let's see I will try and some more of the retarded issues with EQ, <P>1: Quests, .. uhh bullcrap<P>2: NPC interaction .. uhh bullcrap again, you can do the same quest infinite times (with the same character).. hmm ogre shadowknight guild.. VERY hungry guildmaster you can give him 40 lizardman meats and he's still hungry<P>3: faction system ??????? fucking bullcrap, how the hell can the guards tell the difference from a naked erudian paladin, from a naked erudian necromancer, both with same strength and charisma ??? hmmmmm bullcrap.. the only thing i could see that would fix this is, if they had permanent "factions" where gnolls would ALWAYS attack human-types, and humans are allowed into any human town, however, possibly higher level clerics, or mage-types would have some sort of item to determine your class and THEY would be allowed to attack you on sight, OR conversely make a spell to determine a person's religion (what god they are connected to through their worship) and that could be a basis for attacking someone, like for example, priest of bertoxxulous would be attacked by a priest of prexus etc. .. it just bothers me that those guards are omnipotent... now one thing to add to that is.. if you cast a necromantic spell those guards may recognize it and attack you because they know you are a necromancer then... but using spells like shock of poison.. gate, ignite bones,... etc.. they shouldn't be able to tell ;) <P>hmmm<P>and on experience lost on death, and bind affinity, think about this.. you are a level 43 barbarian warrior, you die in lower guk because you went linkdead while walking over to a monster's corpse to loot it.. so you kept walking while you were LD and walked into a bunch of rough monsters who whooped your linkdead arse, you are bound in freeport, you make the run back (30 minutes) because there is no cleric to revive/ressurect/etc  you, then you spend about an entire day getting that lost experience back, and don't feel very happy about EQ because you were set back because of stuff that had nothing to do with the game .. blah blah blah<P>I could give a million examples about retarded game design CHOICES they made, that can be changed easily, but wouldn't make things fair in some situations.. like in a pvp battle. if you are losing.. just turn off your computer and you will live.. umm yes, that can be done, but then again, in that situation, they could make it so that you dont disapear.. not hard to program that.. and only do it for duels, (which is very easy.. start the duel, turn on wait before popping off after LD to 30 seconds) then after duel make it back to 0 seconds.. so many people die in dungeons or outdoor zones because they went LD while walking around in a safe area, but blah blah blah<P>i dont even feel like explaining anymore<P>you know where i stand on these issues, and the bullcrap player economy is just sickening.. everyone will have FBRs and oracle robes in about a year...rubicite?? ive already seen tons of level 5 warriors with that.. let alone the 50% spread of level 1 to 10 warrior/hybrids with full sets of bronze or steel plate, and the sick thing is.. none of these items deteriorate or get removed from teh game in some way.. the only way items get removed from the game permanently are when people suffer from the terrible corpse disearing bug....<P>byebye cruel world<BR>me no talk no more<BR>blah blah blah<P>-------------------------------------<BR>Davood Kehmeekosheh<BR>Formerly level 41 Erudian Necromancer<BR>Formerly on the Bertoxxoulus server<BR>-------------------------------------<P>p.s. don't send me emails asking to get free items from me.. im NOT loading up EQ unless its to play with an emulator, or if they make a lan option for it.. go and play and suffer to earn the items yourself. plus I don't even have it installed anymore.. if you like i can send you screenshots, but thats all your getting from me..

			I don't mind the faction stuff that much, the BS quests, the occasional disconnection and most of the other stuff you mentioned. I too hate the multitude of losers with dumb names like Jarjarbinks or Danecroman or even Spork (And yes, I have SEEN Spork) but if you find a good group, you can pretty much ignore everyone else, and if you can't find a good group, ignore them anyway while you look for one. My biggest issue with this game is the COMPLETE lack of ANYTHING to do for necros. The all high and mighty paladins get quests for holy swords, we get quests for a.......Thex Mallet? And that's actually a shadowknight quest I think. So we can get some beetle eyes, oh wow. So what do we do without necro quests? Camp, kite, camp, kite, repeat ad nauseum. I'm so sick and tired of camping and kiting. Hey, let's sit at this stupid room so we can get our <camped mob like Najena> stolen by the group of wizards! I hate camping, period. I want to be running around, preferably in a dungeon, actually adventuring. I don't see much adventure in killing the same shadowknight, mummy or froglok over and over. I want some zones where you can actually do this well. And the necromancer-friendly merchants would be nice to have too.....<BR>Anyway, farewell Davood, I can't say I ever knew you but from reading your posts you sounded to be among the best, and I'll miss reading your usually informative posts.<P>Serrin<BR>Fennin Ro

			Maybe you just played WAY to much heh, when you do alot it cam become boring. Look at mtv for an example they play the SAME videos over and over and over (when they do play videos) or they play the same shows, it may be fun to watch the first 10 times but after that it gets boring. Same thing applies to everquest. You do the samething Over, and over and over from what ive read it seems all you do is kite gaurds that would get pretty boring, at least IMO. Take a break from it start a new charter, I woudln't do anything drastic like sell my charter. <BR>I do agree that they need to do something about the servers and such.<BR>They also need to make away for melle clases able to bind them selves anywhere, maybe a potion or something, they have potions for healing and invisbilty (im pretty sure they do) why not bind? heck they can be expensive too like 10 20 pp or something.<P>Didn't really know you davood but you seem like a pretty cool person. <BR>good luck in all that you do.....<P>Mordoor

			Because in september, no more video games, for mister davood, university starts again, so he must start getting all video games out of his system, we only play baldur's gate now because we can go at our own pace while playing it, .. like we can stop and start anytime.. like play 20 minutes one day save game and play again 2 days later .... plus everytime we want to play we can play, because its a network connection,  only thing stopping us is power outtage.<P>lots of pre-studying for classes to do as well, we are good students after all ;)<P><P>heh heh.,<P>he emailed verant about switching his account to someone else... its in the process right now..<P>:)<P>fare well world of EQ, if at any point an emulator comes out (or Davood's network programming skills increase some more) we may whack around with eq some more, well just have to see<P>:)<BR>Signed,<BR>by someone, who occasionally plays eq, but is going to stop soon too...<BR>
