			Brothers and sisters,<P>Well, after the friendly response to my last post,<BR>it would seem that some here will AGAIN react negativly, if so, SCREW YOU! THIS is for those that need information.<P>I am not sure if many of you group with enchanters, if you dont, TRUST ME, FIND ONE, and become that players BEST PAL! Enchanters are AWSOME to group with, what with there buffs and de-buffs, AND they have the only charm left in the game. ADD to this the fact that enchanters have a spell called CARITY, THIS spell increases your mana regen. Add to this your Alure of Death, and you, my fellow necro, are a mana machine. NO MORE!!! Last night, while in the pit in Thule, I was with my enchantress pal, she had clarity on her to fellow necros. After a battle, I cast Alure of Death, after a bit, I noticed my mana not shooting up like it used to. Hmmmmm, I wondered, what is wrong, I get up, and notice that ALure of Death was not on. Hmmmmm, maybe the spell failed to cast, since that patch before last, my fizzle rate is WAY UP. I cast it, and get<BR>"the spell fails to take hold". I recast Alure 10 TIMES! EACH FAILED, same message! So, I ask my fellow necromancer to try Alure, to see if it works, he is a couple lvls above me(I of 30th, he 32 lvl). SAME THING!<P>SO, those that think I was wrong before, ONCE AGAIN, Verant proves that they HATE necromancers! I think they must want everything to be Tolkenisk and have only npc necromancers, and the rest of the players to dance around singing happy songs. It seems that every other patch cuts either the Shadowkinghts, or us down AGAIN! If this is not fixed (Word loss, reasurch pets,no mix of ALure and clarity,total nerf of Screaming Terror) I say we protest a weekend. We start one Friday, ALL DAY, every necroamncer on EVERY server send petitions and bug reports on how they seem to be out to cut our legs off. I know, some will say," You just are a ******, EQ loves us, and is not out to get us" Well, why is it that allmost every patch, they nerf us a little more? They broke spells, and took months to fix, they took our Charm, and gave us Screaming Terror. When they realized we had a us for it, the nerfed that. They STILL have not fixed the DoT bug. THIS is a MAJOR problem, imagine if a Wiz used a line of DD spells, and if that spell caused the kill, ding, no corpse, no exp? You think this class would be quite? HELL NO. Wizards bitch about others having some spells that do as much damage. THey bitch because 1 SPELL is a MAJOR quest. Let me tell you, if they made our pets buyable, and made Lich a quest, which I am SURE it is, I would not be so pissed.<BR> <BR>Add to thsi the fact that they wiped out our 29th and 34, and so on non-stack words, and you have got to realize Verant doesnt give a damn about us! YES, I love being a necro, it is a challenge I enjoy. TO A POINT, Verant seems to go out to make it VERY hard on us. WHY? Someone please answer me why?<P>But, back to my final point, on the Friday of our protest, we ALL send bug and petitions on how they have messed with us AGAIN. IF, nothing is done, the NEXT weekend, we have a GAME WIDE necro sit out. EVERY NECROMANCER sits out of EQ for a weekend. YOu can paly other classes, BUT, dont paly your necromancer! This worked for enchanters, I was told they were nerfed WORSE thatn us at one point, but after a sit out, well Verant woke up FAST and did something. <P>Brothers, sisters, let us work together to make our darkness a bit better,<P>Gaeorn Kinslayer<BR>

			I agree with what you've said.  Thanks to the present uncertainty with respect to DoT's, kiting, pets etc I've quit playing my necro and gone back to my cleric.  I've put 21 lvls into my necro and Verant seems determined to make that a complete waste of effort and time so until I know whats happening my necro is shelved. So frankly ^%*&)&#$ Verant and their stupidity. (Clerics are so booooorrrrriiiinnngg to play).

			Let me start by saying i have experience I have an erudite necro i played to 43 a troll shaman i played to 28 and my present character a Dark elve necro at 24 Now first off lets say Yes I play my necro because i enjoy it. However with each patch i enjoy us less and less and im not going to go play a druid because we suck I LIKE NECROS.<BR>  So you younger players know just how much we suck ill explain why i stoped playing my erudite necro... I still do not have a single pet after 29, Neither do 3 of my friends of similar levels... with the removal of charm we are no longer able to solo in dungeons, and if you ever tried playing the high levels without going to dungeons you should know it aint gonna work.<BR>I regularly get kills stolen by players several levels below me because our direct damage is pitiful and kill stealers know that.<BR>I only group with my friends... mostly wizards... because they are the only ones who pity me enough to help me get exp. <BR>        Yes we can solo sand giants... But so can wizards... why dont they? its very risky and requires a LOT of downtime even after a successful battle.  Necros are simply braver i guess. (interesting note in oasis once i saw a wizard and a druid teaming a sg, both were around 32-33 they took down the sg fast and neither one had a scratch on them... and they repeated this act several times)<P>Now for the last 5 major patches 4 yes FOUR OUT OF FIVE of them were deliberately nerfing necros the closest other class was druids with one nerf.<P>If Verant doesnt return us to at least some shred of our former glory i fear that there will be large armies of low level druids soon forming. And the forest of Nektulos will ring with the sound of silence.
