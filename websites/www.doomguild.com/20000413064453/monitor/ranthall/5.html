			<BR>  First, I understand that some things should have a limit to it, or players shouldn't be able to do certain things least they exploit the situation.<P>  But Varant's paranoid.  I've noticed from day one that anything which you could actually use strategy and thought for, or especially use your spell-caster to her/his full potential, they lable it an exploit and stop you from doing it!  To the the point of being absolutly absurd.<P>  A spell-caster's _main_ means of survival is using their spells to the fullest and avoiding a hand-to-hand as much as possible.  We all know this, and the caster's ability to do so is a major part of the beauty of the class.  Take, for instance, casting from what should be an un-reacable location.  Hmm.. let's use Black Burrow for example.  Lots of us should know this area, but for those who don't...<P>  The entrance to Black Burrow is a cave in what appears to be the shape of a large dog's jaw.  There's four "teeth", which are the two in front.  The "snout" is connected to a very large block of stone.  All in all, I'd guess it goes up about 20 to 30 feet, in game distance.<P>  A player is able to "climb" the hill and stand on top of this block, indeed, climb up even further.  Now that's getting up there.  Being a spell-caster class, Necromancer of course, I seen this as a prestine opportunity.<P>  However, Varant apparently put the blocks to this, as I experianced in great shock!  After nailing the creature with the spell, it didn't climb up after me -- it went _inside_ of the tunnel -- and started pummling me from below!  Through tens of feet of stone between us!  Could I hit back with my weapon?  No!  Of course not, which means that the MOBs are deliberatly given this ability.<P>  There are also other redicules limitations, such as not being able to attack something that's in water when you're on land.  Your spells have absolutly no effect on them, and your pet will you that it is an illegal target.<P>  It seems varant would be oh-so much happier if they could get rid of all of the spell-casting classes (especially Necro) and only have fighters.  After all, the _only_ thing they apparently don't see as an exploit, is charging head-on at something and beginning to swing.  This is ludicris and suicide for a spell-caster.  Sure, we get pets, but we all know they only go so far and we're also painfully limited in what we can do with them, as well.<P>   This is redicules.  Why even have a spell-casting class if all you're going to be able to do is stand there, swing, and hope to get the spell off between being treated as a rag doll.  I swear, it's like varant is affraid to let their players innovate and think, and are _deliberately_ squashing one's ability to use strat and one's imagination & thought and forcing us all to basically be figher classes.  It's absurd, what are they affraid of?  Indeed, _paranoid_ of??<P>   Talk about control freaks, give the players at least _SOME_ freedom.  You put us (Necros especially) through enough MUD (heh) as it is without such extreme and absurd limitations.<P>   Okay, well folks this is the rant place and I really needed to get that off of my chest. : )  Later,<P>~Myskyra

			I hafta agree, and respond. I'm not a necro(heh..yup sluggo, the only reason I read these boards is because your a guild brother. be proud. =) ) but I am a spellcaster too. (Heh..of the enchanter class too, which has be abused almost to the point of insanity, like shadow knights.) I also read fantasy books.  In one story, one of the heros saw a sleeping dragon in a cave(ice cave and dragon, FYI) and he threw his hammer, hitting a huge spear of ice hanging from the ceiling. This, of course, came crashing down and killed the dragon(went through back, cracking his spine). Would this EVER, EVER, EVER happen in a game? No. It would be 'too easy'. I mean, it's useless to use your mind and think about the game when all you hafta do is set your self into a 'SEEK-CON-CAST-KILL' rythm and you can go on a spree of death. Now, that's not too fun, but it works. It also keeps players from leveling too fast. It also kills the imagination of players. It also kills thought. It also kills roleplaying. It kills the gaming spirit. It turns Everquest into a midevil Quake! Unless that's what Verant secrectly wants, then need to do some massive changing. If others feel this way, and think gamers should be able to find advantages(if Verant makes them harded to find, but still useable, that's fine too!) and use them, post here. Maybe we can attract some attention.<P>-Teart, who's enchanter took about 3 weeks to make 7 while his rogue is there in almost 3 days.

			Although a lot of this would be cool, hitting an ice spike off of a ceiling to kill a dragon would be THE MOST CAMPED spot in the game and everyone would be there fighting over it. : ) Hell, I would throw my staff at it to save me the trouble of actually killing it. 8) I like the idea though, but they would need to put in some stuff a little more constructive like, do this to get into here or something to that effect. I would like that, maybe even have traps that you / a rogue would have to disarm before you pass through. Or have boxes on monsters that are trapped and so on. But having points of disadvantage to an char / npc would not be put in. Look at it from the fighters point of view. Here he is, down on the ground, watching a wizard nuke a monster that cant touch him cause he is not in the water with the monster "fighting it" or on some ledge that it cant get to. But when the fighter fights it, he has to stand there and take blows and pray he lives. Hell, If I could cast on a monster that was in the water while I was on land, I would be in Erudin hunting sharks. :) They are blood red to me. I think they do need to come up with something that would be more along the lines of to do this / get to this place in the dungeon, you need to have this item, touch this pressure plate, disarm this trap, etc...<P>My 2 cents...<P>Taerath 12th Level Gnome Necro

			As a programmer, I suspect that, although the world is 3D, the nearness algorithms are only 2D Why this would be is idiotic, but it's a legacy concept from the olden days of restricted-3D games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D.<P>If so, I suspect it's just laziness on the part of Verant.

			but i really think Verant did a good job on EverQuest. I see why you are so mad that you cant sit on top of a 50 foot buliding and cast the mob to hell, but if you could actually do that, dont you think it would retract from the game. I'd hate to see a bunch of really powerful wizards and necros (and what ever else that has a damage spell) just sit on top of a buliding, and nuke the badguys. I really believe that then, all that the casters would know how to do is to cast on a bad guy till oom, and med. rinse, repeat, and theres a level....really really easily. Not only would the caster not have to move(aside from getting a mob over to him), but it wouldnt be a challenge. The game would be filled with powergamers, and the like. If they made it so the casters could do that, then the melee characters would just be outa luck. They have little, if none, ranged attack. So it would be a caster only thing, and i see that as a bug. This way, the casters have to think more about what is going on, and the bigger picture, than just sitting on some rock, while the monster just runs in circles, waiting to be killed. The game is definately designed around groups and later on, you will have to. There is just too much of a risk solo'ing. unless you enjoy dying and losing alot of exp, time, and not to mention all of your loot and whatnot. Now Necros and other pet classes can somewhat over come this fear by gateing out when you get over your head, and sacrificing your pet. But still, you are gonna die. Its a given. So just get over it and play the game how it is.

			Sure its fine for them to add a warriors frenzy for when he is low on hp. But I ask why havent they added the specilazation skills in to reduce casting time and mana cost. Sure its nice being able to strike from a distace. But A) We get resisted B) We get interrupted. Its frustrating to watch your character die becuase one your spells get interrputed and two your melee sucks.<P>Of course with my pet I dont worry too much but I can see how Wizards get pissed a lot. Plus they lose a lot of time looking for a party. There just isnt always a party around willing to take you on. Like if you play weird hours or whatnot.<BR>

			If Everquest was so badly designed why are the people who claim this still paying to play it?<P>Yes, it's difficult playing a spellcaster, especially in the beginning, but it does start to pay off at higher levels. Specialize reduces your mana and allows you to concentrate on a particular spell type. As a necro, if you don't like taking hits let your pet take some, taking turns in melee with your pet is a key tactic for a necro, you can heal your pet, buff your pet, do whatever is needed to make sure they last longer.<P>There may be some aspects of the game that are viewed unfair, such is life. You may not be able to kill a monster from afar, but there are plenty of ways to use the game design to your advantage. So the monster can hit you through walls or from beneath the floor. Well since height isn't taken into consideration, think of summoning your corpse from a lower level in a dungeon? Saves alot of heartache. Instead of suffering from "It's not fair" tantrums, make the best of the situation.<BR>And if all else fails email Verant, they do actually listen to suggestions.<P>It's only a game, just have fun

			Most people are still playing because they are on free time from the original sign up. All of the friends that I got to join are waiting till their time is up. I re-upped because I want to try the race-war server, but I know that the first decent multiplayer game will kill EQ for good. For us that will probably be AOK or Homecoming.<P>The second thought is: the game when it was release was MUCH better from a play ballance perspective. You are sold a character being told that they ill bew able to do certain things, then the wind blows up Verant's ass and they take what they promised away. Where is the class-action lawsuit?
