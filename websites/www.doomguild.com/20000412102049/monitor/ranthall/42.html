			I hate saying bad things about talented people, but I've given them plenty of time to get their act together.<P>Verant's ability to create quality updates sucks.<P>It's inexcusable.<P>Almost every patch, something that is announced doesn't work, or partly works, or isn't actually implemented, or something else.  Someone in the dev team seriously needs to go back and look at the idea of "testing" again.<P>Amateur volunteer coders for MUDs--whose code runs 100,000 lines or more--can put out bug-free updates time after time after time.  There is <i>no excuse</i> for professional programmers to be unable to do the same.  Isn't this what they have the test server for, not to mention their own private machines to try things out on?<P>That said, I can understand them not getting to certain things.  Some apparently simple problems have very complex causes and solutions, and you want to have time to do it right.  But for heaven's sake, if they're NOT going to do it right (and they frequently aren't so far), at least they could try fixing everything at once!<P>Finally, I just want to point out that the problem is unlikely to be with any individual coder.  They have to have plenty of top-notch people working there.  Whoever manages the coders just needs to structure things so that you get out a tested product and not what one programmer figured, at 3am, ought to do the trick.<P>(Sloppiness is rampant somewhere.  Remember the initial parser for strings that ate / and : and a bunch of other symbols even when they were in the middle of text, for no reason?  A sophomore CS major would be embarassed to show someone code that did that, much less have it appear in an international product.)<P>  --Ichoran

			>    Anyone who has <BR>>spent more than, say, 6 months <BR>>as a professional developer would know <BR>>that quality is inversely proportionate to <BR>>time spent on a project. <P>Quality is inversely proportional to complexity which is proportional to time that needs be spent on a project to get it working.  If you cut time off a project by failing to test it, however, quality goes down.  I trust that your experience confirms this.<P>>    The problem isn't <BR>>management or the ability of the <BR>>programmers, it is the huge number <BR>>of whiny immature customers that want <BR>>everything to be fixed yesterday.  <BR>>With all the constant complaining about <BR>>how "my class sucks," it is <BR>>no wonder that Verant is forced <BR>>to sacrifice quality.<P>Forced is a relative term.  Management is <i>willing</i> to let the huge number of whiny immature customers boss them around to the extent that they fail to do a good job.  That just creates yet more whining.  I can understand initial problems in the rush to fix post-release bugs.  That rush is over.  Updates are no longer weekly.  It's time that management, who is supposed to be in charge of such things, provides a bit of a buffer for the dev team so they have time to verify that they did things properly.<P>>    Volunteer MUD coders <BR>>have WAY too much time on <BR>>their hands and 100,100 lines of <BR>>code is child's play.  I <BR>>can generate 20,000 lines of code <BR>>in a 60-hour week and not <BR>>break a sweat.  EverQuest probably <BR>>has 300,000 lines of code at <BR>>least.  Most likely more.<P>Have you actually looked at the 100k lines of code that make up most MUDs?  Depending on the version (no, Smaug doesn't count, it was mostly rewritten), you often have a collection of hacks written by dozens of different people.  This isn't child's play, but can be handled by someone with sufficient experience.  To the amateur, large chunks of the code are a semi-mysterous black box.  But they can get it to do what they want by testing until they get it right.  Note that I did say <i>amateur</i>.  If you're a professional developer, I agree, it ought to be child's play to you.<P>>    Pointing out the <BR>>parser is just a cheap shot. <BR>> The fact that it takes <BR>>out certain characters is insignificant compared <BR>>to the other issues that the <BR>>dev team has to face.  <P>Except for the small fact that text is the primary form of interaction that gives the virtual world its social feel, and that was constantly hampered by garbled text.  It is an insigificant programming problem with a major impact on the user interface.  This is the kind of thing that <i>should be fixed</i>--it is insignificant to do, yet it will improve things noticably!<P>(It should have been three one-line (or small) changes:<BR>  (1) Eat all whitespace at the beginning of the string (simple while loop)<BR>  (2) Parse when on first nonwhitespace character (simple if-statement).<BR>  (3) Don't parse on the remainder of the string (comment out one line of code or move it to if-statement above.)<BR>Obviously they could have made it harder than this, but really, you could rewrite the entire parser front-end in about 30 minutes.)<P>>And I know first hand that <BR>>any sophomore CS student wouldn't give <BR>>a flying (*$^$& that his parser <BR>>dropped characters, as long as he/she <BR>>scored a B or better on <BR>>the project and still had time <BR>>to play Quake in the lab <BR>>until 5am.  In fact most <BR>>sophomore CS students don't even know <BR>>how to open and write to <BR>>a file, let alone write a <BR>>command-line parser.<P>We apparently know different types of sophomore CS students.  Simple string manipluation was usually taught early where I was from.  And if you showed off a program that bungled it, you were liable to get snickered at.  As far as grades went, sure, who cared?  But as a point of pride among students, boasting about something where basic things were buggy was not really viable if we were pretending to be "done".<P>>    I realize everyone <BR>>is frustrated about the quality of <BR>>some things, but you have to <BR>>remember how complicated this game is. <P>I know, I said as much myself.  There are still pathing errors.  Okay, fine, it's complicated, it will take time to work out.  But what about things where a trivial test would be enough?<P>For instance, the new Wizard Fire Spiral spell now has the correct data in research.  (Never mind how it got messed up before, they were rushed, I can understand that.)  But the spell doesn't work properly (for instance, it isn't a fire spell).  How long would it have taken for someone to create a character of the appropriate level, the appropriate words, made the spell, scribed the spell, and cast it?  About two minutes.  And that isn't even something a coder would have to do themselves.<P>Shadow Vortex was broken when it first came out.<P>Hungry Earth was supposed to appear in research but the scroll that is made is Shadow Vortex with the name "Hungry Earth" and the components for "Umbral Messenger".  Misnaming is tolerable, though unnecessary, but creation of the wrong spell?<P>This stuff isn't complex, it's basic.  Complaints about "I don't have time!" aren't really valid because they already took the time to figure out what data and/or code they needed to change.  Testing it is only a small, if irritating, addition in time.<P>> You either have to be <BR>>patient and let them fix things <BR>>right, or tolerate lack of quality <BR>>because you wanted everything done yesterday.<P>I'm all for being patient.  That's why this is in the "rants" section.  I'm here being patient and they bring out twice as many broken things as before.  Certain Verant high-ups are fond of pointing out that there will always be new bugs.  Sure.  Doesn't mean that they have to encourage them.<P>(I also wonder sometimes what their code looks like.  I know that I, alone, in a day, could code and test on a MUD what they announce as a week's work or more, and which has no apparent graphical element.  Something must be going on there, and it must be important, but I'm mystified as to what it could be--especially given Brad McQuaid's recent posts implying that he doesn't have coders on his dev team working on the expansion yet.  Part of it, I'm sure, is fixing small bugs which go unannounced.  Maybe a lot of it?)<BR> <BR>> It is your choice.  <P>Not really, it's management's choice.  If they decide to try to do everything yesterday and have lack of quality, I'm stuck with it, and so are you.  My point is that it is about time for them to choose differently.  It will actually be more efficient in the long run because they won't have people returning to the same problem over and over.<P>  Ichoran<BR>

			    Actually most of the CS students at my school (University of Michigan) that I knew were Computer Engineering drop-outs so maybe that explains it. :)<P>    I was a Computer Engineering major so none of that applied to me...exactly.  I didn't give a flying (&&#$ either, but for totally different reasons.<P>    Your first post obviously wasn't as well-thought-out as your second and you didn't appear as knowledgeable.  Your second post dispells that appearance and I apologize for the semi-flame.  It is not usually in my character but I have been getting quite frustrated lately at people who expect software to work like magic.<P>    As for management having a choice, well that is still something I disagree on.  Verant is funded by 989, a division of Sony.  Sony wants happy customers because they have a reputation to keep up and I am sure that Verant is trying to get funded for their next endeavor.  Sony reads all this stuff about people wanting stuff fixed and that they will cancel their accounts.<P>    Sony gets a cut of everyone's monthly fee so they look at this and say to Verant "You idiots better fix this stuff NOW!!!  Make them happy!" or something like that.  So Verant rushes the fixes/features out buggy instead of taking the time and fixing really important bugs.<P>    There is not always a choice.  PC game companies do not make that much money.  Verant will probably make enough after payroll and bills and Sony's cut to fund the expansion pack.  Then they have to look to Sony to fund the next game or they all have to find new jobs.<P>    So get pissed at Sony for pressuring from above and the user base for whining and not being patient, but not at Verant.  They are discovering how shitty their position is and I don't envy them one bit.  I have been there.  They are doing the best they can.  <P>Silen of Neriak, Solusek Ro
