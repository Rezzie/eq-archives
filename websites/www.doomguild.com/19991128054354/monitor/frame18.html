Greetings..<br><br>
Below is a cut + paste of my returning message on the boards explaining my absence:<br><br>
Hello everyone!<br>
I'm sure many of you have wondered where I have been the last few weeks. As many of you know, I play Sluggo on the Xegony server. Due to an unfortunate bug, I lost my corpse due to a bug. I have invested much time in my character, who is Level 44, and had acquired many rare items. I petitioned with hope that the GMs would actually do something.. but alas my hopes were in vain. I had a few extra items in the bank which I sold to twink a new character, a cleric. All said, I got a decent new character, but didn't have the heart to play Sluggo again. It was a hard decision. However in recent days I have begun to play Sluggo again, and am in the process of re-equipping him (if anyone on Xegony wants to donate something send me a tell :P) and hopefully finding a new spot to hunt. Or maybe a group now that Verant FINALLY fixed the DOT bug! Oh wait.. they didn't =( Well they SAY they did!<br><br>
Hopefully Verant will actually fix the DOT bug this time, hopefully concentrating on it before they nerf our DOTs on the live servers.  I'll keep everyone updated on this issue, as well as many others affecting Necros (including why Wizards can quest for Ice Comet, but we can't for Invoke Death).  Stay tuned.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Kiting Issues</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
As many folks know, Verant is attempting to address the recent issue of Kiting.  I won't go into detail as to what kiting is, because I'm sure every Necro knows how to do it.  Soloing for a Necro is a way of life, since the DOT bug limits our usefulness in groups.  Without DOTs, Necros are essentially mana drainers, with only 2 nukes to our name (and one of those at 44th with only limited usefulness).  With DOTs, we are a valuable asset in a group, able to outpace any class for overall damage.  Throw in a decent pet, and Necros are actually useful in a group.<br>
However many people are stricken with the 'Grass is Greener' syndrome, and complain incessantly to Verant.  However people have failed to realize the problems that Necros face, including Verant <b>forcing</b> us to kite because our pets are impossible to keep current, and we are useless in groups.  Essentially, Necros will be nerfed completely as a class should Verant choose to nerf kiting.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Recently, famed Arch Magi GZ mass responded to concerned emailers in his usual vague, helpless manor.  Here's what he had to say:<br><br>
<i>If you are getting this mail, it is because you e-mailed me concerning the recent modifications to DoT spells in reference to Kiting on the test server. I am sorry that you are getting a group reply, but there were too many e-mails to respond to each of you individually.<br>
I did want, however, for you all to at least get a response.<br>
DoT spells will most likely be changed with the next patch. I can not go in to detail about what they changes are yet – we are still testing and do not want to prematurely announce what we will do.<br>
Be assured that the changes will not eliminate Kiting, nor will they make DoT spells useless. For many people, the changes that we make will increase the power of your DoT spells. For those of you that kite, you will lose a bit of efficiency kiting. <br>
Kiting in its current state is bad for the game because it allows certain classes to take out creatures of levels that other classes have absolutely no chance of taking out. This kind of imbalance is not something that we want in EQ. <br>
The reason that we are putting these changes in now is that we finally heard a solution that we found acceptable AND that had minimal impact on the rest of the game. Most other suggestions involved getting rid of or limiting SoW (which would effect everybody) or getting rid of all movement spells together. Kiting in its most common form involves SoW and a DoT. Kiting can also be done with Snare and DD or a Bow, the Necromancer Darkness series, Journeyman boots and DD, Root Bombing, etc. Any time that you can move faster then your opponent, there is trouble (and you are doing some form of kiting). If we were going to completely fix kiting, we would have to take EVERY instance that let you move faster then a monster and fix it. That would have a huge impact on EQ – we do not want to do it.<br>
We have a change that has a much softer impact going in – look for our announcement about it soon. I think you will be pleasantly surprised about what we are doing – at least compared to what you probably think we are due to rampant rumors.<br>
As a side note, we played with different powers of DoT’s and Kiting on the test server. People saw this and started posting. Now, just as a reminder, test is for testing. Thank you all for your prompt e-mails noticing that were we testing DoT spells. Please realize in the future that just because we are testing something on test does not mean that it will go live.<br>
As a side note, we think that we got most of the DoT bug fixed. This means that you will be able to use your DoT’s in a party situation, making your class much more powerful (the Necro’s should be very happy with this one). I have heard reports that there still may be a case where there is a bug – but it happens MUCH less frequently. If you experience this bug, please e-mail use a report of what spells you were using, what you were fighting, the classes in your party and the size of your party. Any info (the more specific the better) you can give us on this bug (if it exists) would be greatly appreciated. Please e-mail this to ggrobson@verant.com. This address is ONLY for bugs related to DoT spells.<br>
If you still have issues with this, please wait a week or two before e-mailing me. I have a backlog of e-mail that I want to get answered – e-mailing me later will ensure that I have more time to read what you send me.<br>
Have a good one, and feel free to repost this.<br>

<b>Here's a repost from the last issue, I still get a few additions now and then :)</b><br><br>
The petition has been sent in to Verant.  Thanks to all who have added their name, the final count was well over 1,500 individual names.  With any luck we will start to see a change over the next few updates.

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Screaming Terror</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Screaming Terror is a fear-based spell that was recently added to replace the Charm spell.  Screaming Terror will not only fear your target, but it also has the ability to wipe the target's hate list.  It appears that both aspects of this spell are able to be resisted, and there is no way to tell unless your target comes back for you.  Beware, do not use this spell in conjuction with DOTs, unless you want the target to come back.  There will be no way the hate list is wiped with DOTs in effect.
<br><br>
<b>Addendum:</b>  <i>Screaming Terror works indoors only now, and Verant has yet to make it a one save spell.  Used to have hope, now another useless spell in Necro arsenal.<br><br></i>
