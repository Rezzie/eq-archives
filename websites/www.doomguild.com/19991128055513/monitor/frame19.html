Greetings..<br><br>
Once again we are here with a new issue.  The recent patch has made it effectively harder to kite, however it has not addressed the ability of Damage-only classes (Mages, Wizards) ability to kite.  Of course I knew Verant would not address this, and I doubt that they ever will.<br><br>
Check below for a prelimnary analysis of the patch, and the next issue will have full details regarding the changes of the most recent patch (13 September).<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
In the recent patch Verant made some changes to kiting:<br><br>
<i>
DoT Changes:<br>
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT spell works.<br>
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there is no change to how a DoT spell works.<br>
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied (happens every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it would have taken.  <br>
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased.  If the monster moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much damage from the DoT as it would before the patch.  If the monster moves for less then 18 seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage then it would have done before the patch.  If the monster moves more then 18 seconds during the fight, it will take less damage then it would have before the patch.<br><br>
</i>

Obviously if a monster is in melee, then the DOT does the <b>same</b> damage it did pre-patch.  And if the NPC is feared or rooted, then the DOT will do the same pre-patch damage.  However, if you are effectively kiting the monster, then the DOT will do 66% of its pre-patch damage.  What bothers me is that spell designed for kiting (Darkness line) will seem to be affected.  Perhaps if Verant had implemented code that when the NPC is under a motion-affecting, then the DOT will do normal damage.<br>
The last change is a bit confusing, it would seem if you time the kiting, and rooted the target every 17 seconds, that the DOTs will actually do <b>more</b> damage.  I will test this out, apparently kiting has become much more of an art than a tactic.<br><br>

<i>- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable.</i><br>
Uwee.. L49 root spell in game.<br><br>
<i>- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.</i><br>
I doubt this spell could made more effective, as it is completely useless now.  I'll perform some tests.<br><br>
<i>- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save - this should stop the 'train' problems that it was causing.</i><br>
Hmm.. should have been all or nothing in the first place.  Wonder who the genius on the Dev Team was that decided it should be all or nothing.<br><br>
<i>- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers - check your tomes.</i><br>
Researchable?  I don't see scribable.  If it is indeed scribable and actually produces a useable, please <a href="mailto:Faust@doomguild.com">mail me</a>!  I will post the results tonight!<br><br>
<i>- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition are now more easily identifiable.</i><br>
I guess GZ has begun to cure himself of cranius rectitus and fixed it.. finally.<br><br>
<i>- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating.</i><br>
Guess that means its got Levitate now?<br><br>
<i>- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed.  This means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that it will now stack with the darkness line.</i><br>
And how about taking out the Effect:  Illusion Skeleton part too?  That doesn't add anything except eye candy and increases the chance of a save.  Maybe if it actually made the target into an Undead creature for its duration *wink*.<br><br>
<i>- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt.  Pets default to /pet taunt.</i><br>
Does this mean the pet will actually be able to taunt now?<br><br>
<i>- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.</i><br>
Slightly?  As in.. 2 damage per tick? We'll see.<br><br>
<i>- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added.</i><br>
If you find anything out about this please <a href="mailto:faust@doomguild.com">mail me</a>!  I'll get this posted right away too.. lets just hope it doesn't involve killing Cazic Thule or Nagafen.  Maybe it'll be a pansy waitfest like the IC rods..<br><br>

<b>Here's a repost from the last issue, I still get a few additions now and then :)</b><br><br>
The petition has been sent in to Verant.  Thanks to all who have added their name, the final count was well over 1,500 individual names.  With any luck we will start to see a change over the next few updates.

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
<i>- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage.</i><br>
Does this mean their ability to tank has been lessened?  Also does it affect Mages?  Please let me know!<br><br>
<i>- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better.</i><br>
I'll believe it when I see it.<br><br>

So our pets have been nerfed.  Not that it was any surprise.. Verant staff swore it was <i>only a possibility</i> the DOT and pet nerfs would go live.. but we knew better.. didn't we.<br><br>
