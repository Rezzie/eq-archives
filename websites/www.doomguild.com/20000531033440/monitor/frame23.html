Greetings..<br><br>
With this issue once again comes rumors (some more accurate than others) about nerfing Necromancers yet again.  However it is important to take the news with a grain of salt, as indeed there is valid reasoning to label Charm/FD as a bug.  However, it strikes me extremely odd that almost a full year after the game was released Verant is still labeling such instances as these as bugs.  Indeed it is not a bug, rather a game feature that many of their customers complained against because they could not take advantage of it.  Thus, instead of Verant admitting indeed it is a full blown Nerf, they label it as a bug and we should be thankful it lasted as long as it did.<br><br>
As it is now, Necromancers have just lost a great deal of power in an area they should have no comparison in:  Control of the Undead.  My example:  If you Charm a frog in Guk at the zone, have it guard there, and you then run to the bridge area and Feign Death, how does the frog know?  Does he have some special link with his master?  Herein lies the fault in Verant's RP reason, and as mentioned before Verant likes to sugarcoat everything they nerf.<br><br>
Anyways I'm rambling at this point.  I encourage everyone to write a well thought out, long, feedback next time you are OOM.  Its a great way to pass the time, as well as give Verant a piece of your mind.  Keep in mind a great number of Feedbacks eased back the nerf of FD the first time.  And keep something in mind:  Suggest Verant give charmed pets the same save roll against FD as Mobs do.  Do NOT listen to Abashi, every mob gets a save factor when you cast FD, and sometimes they will see through FD.  GZ has stated this numerous times, rub it in their face.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Thus far I have heard mixed feedback about the 'greatness' of this spell.  I rarely see it used on my server, Xegony, for anything other than fetching bodies out of walls or lava.  As it is, the coffins make it too encumbering to use in the Alter Planes, not too mention awkward to carry.  Indeed this spell will affect the Necromancer class in a hardly noticeable way.  Alot of hype surrounded this spell, and once again Verant has pumped something to be what it really isn't.<br><br>
To acquire the spell is more of a crapshoot than anything else, I have read reports of people waiting 30 hours before even seeing the Ishva that drops it.  As it stands now, Summon Corpse is an item that requires too much effort for the payoffs, in my opinion=).<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Equipment Guide: Blighted Armor</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Welcome to the first of several equipment guides that will soon grace the issues of The Necromonitor.  Included will be detailed item info, drop info, any other worthy notes about it.<br><br>
Blighted Robe  - AC 11, DEX 10, STA 10, INT 13, MANA 40<br>
Blighted Cap   - AC  5, WIS  7, INT  8, HP  10, MANA 20<br>
Blighted Boots - AC  4, AGI 14, HP   5, POI 10<br>
Blighted Gloves- AC  4, DEX 10, INT  8, DIS 12, MANA 12<br>
Blighted Arms  - AC  5, INT  7, HP  15, FIR  9<br>
Blighted Pants - AC  5, STR  3, DEX  4, HP  10, COLD 10<br><br>
Total Stat Modifiers for the complete suit:<br>
AC +34, STR +3, STA +10, AGI +14, DEX +24, INT +36, WIS +7, CHA +0, SV FIR +9, SV COLD +10, SV POIS +10, SV DIS +12, MANA +72, HP +40.<br><br>
All of these items will be found on Boogeymen in the Plane of Fear, as well as a slight chance of drop on Phoboplasms in Fear as well.  Overall the suit affords a healthy dose of INT and MANA, however when compared to other classes Armor and the rate of droppage (only Wizards will have a harder time obtaining armor amongst pure casters), Blighted Armor leaves alot to be desired.  In the following issues we will have class armor comparisons.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
<b>Dead Man Floating</b><br><br>
Dead Man Floating is a Level 44 research only spell that can be labeled as an all around buff.  It costs 150 mana to cast, with no reagents.  It grants the target See Invisible, Water Breathing, Levitate, as well as +64 to +70 SV POIS dependant upon level.  However, it does have its drawbacks.. such as it is completely useless in Kedge Keep, due to Verant's claims that 'levitations spells are not meant to work in underwater zones' such as Kedge Keep.  What strikes me as odd is the levitation component was added just a few patches before KK came out.. hmm.<br><br>
Nonetheless DMF is an excellent utility buff that will see much use upon its inscription in your spellbook.
