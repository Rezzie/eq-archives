			I cannot understand verant at all, the people running this company must really have no common sense.<P> The new patches are becoming more and more pitiful.<BR> Many are  useless. i.e. great, you spent weeks fixing guild names, wonderful. Or how about the time spent making the names flash above your target(what a waste). <BR> Many don't work at all,i.e "new" spells which are fixed aren't fixed at all, and the ones we do want fixed aren't<BR> Many are half-assed to mediocre filler material ,i.e. god, making many items no drop lore items was a sad fix for camping, poison and critical hit for warriors and rougues was just a band aid for a bullet hole, and the new pathing code for mobs has so many problems and bugs it isn't even funny.<P>Not to mention the horrible support and updates to what the team at Verant really are doing. Great, I know that identify magic and sense magic will be updated in the future with a more useful spell, and the zones paineel and the hole will be added in the "near" future.<BR>How about some idea as to what you guys have in store fom us and what you have in mind? What are the long term plans? For camping? For kiting? For exploits?For classes?  We'd like to know considering we pay a monthly fee to play.<BR>I don't want to hear thing after they appear on the test server. I don't want to hear things from the select few web masters and high lvl people you decide to talk to. I hate getting infomation from "someone who talked to a guy working at verant and says". Is it too much to ask for a page which has your long term plans and what I can expect from the next patch to hit the test server?<P>I also can't but help think that the head guys who do make the game aren't listening or seeing what the game is all about . If I remeber correctly a few weeks ago there was a lunchon with the crew of Verant, many question were asked and many were answer, what really sticks in my mind though was one question. Q from one of the head honchos: how did you guys hit 50 so fast? A:Oh we killed guards Q:(the head guy)acts surprised and makes a phone call on his cell phone.......oh boy, if they didn't know that was how people were leveling to 50 so quickly it really must be evidence they have no idea how EQ is played or that they've never played EQ at all.....yeesh.<P>I cannot but help seeing that all of the developers at verant working on the expansion, with the horrible service and patches I have to ask myself where the hell has all the "smart" people who first create the world of norrath gone to? The only answer is " the expansion", I really can't be excited about the expansion. With the new texture limit, does it mean that the loading time will be longer? The new zones will be crowded too, and good zones will be camped to hell.<BR>What verant should be considering is the existing zones which have so many problems. One right off the top of my head is the unbalance between Odus and Fay. Odus, a continent, is quite possibly the worst collection of zones in all of the game, it has nothing to offer anyone. Meanwhile Fay is jam packed with "good" zones. Verant should be making the "bad" zones better so the population will be distributed evenly. Many zones are close to empty due to bad design or itemization meanwhile others are overbriming with people, fix these verant instead of making a new batch of crappy to good zones.<P>This game is reminding me too much of UO, a lot a frustration and horrible support, Verant really need to learn that it's the developer who makes the game but it's consumer who makes or brakes it. <P>
