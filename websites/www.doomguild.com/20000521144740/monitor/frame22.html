Greetings..<br><br>
With our 22nd Issue we bring you great news about the future of Necromancers, including an awesome new spell and an analysis of a recently updated spell.  Also you will find a brand new poll, something never before seen on this site.  I will include a new poll in each new issue for the next few issues, and then a feedback poll on what the readers feel about it.  With it there is a possibility of running polls and submitting them to Verant, as this has remained the premier website dedicated to Necromancers.  Please enjoy the issue!

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">New Spell: Summon Corpse</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Recent rumors have confirmed that indeed there is a new spell slated to enter the Necromancer arsenal:  Summon Corpse.  Although it will have heavy drawbacks ( including high mana cost, relatively expensive and horrendously awkward reagents ), this spell will bring praise upon Necromancers for CR around the land.  No longer will players have to wait when corpses are stuck in walls, no longer will you have to find a 'lost' corpse, and CR in High Level areas will become substantially easier.  More news to come on this highly anticipated spell!

<b>Addendum:</b>  The Jade Inlaid Coffin is IN GAME!  It may purchased for roughly 165 platinum (65 CHA) from <b>Dvis Zexus</b> in the Cleric Guild in Neriak!  He also sells the rocks to TP into Hate..:)  Thanks to Chigowitz Powderus for the tip, I have just confirmed it this moment.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Further Update on Feign Death</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
With the most recent patch, some changes went into effect that further altered the effects of Feign Death.  In general, any mob under Level 35 is supposed to 'forget' about you when you succesfully Feigned.  On mobs over Level 35, the immediate effects are somewhat different.  If the mob returns to its spawn/home point, it is supposed to forget you 90% of the time.  The effects on mobs without a home point, namely roamers, are fairly less pronounced.  Contrary to Verant's acknowledgements, mobs without a home point seem to always remember you when you cancel Feign Death.  Caution is urged when using this spell!

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
In the next few issues you will see a new breed of article, something I think every Necromancer will enjoy.<br>
-There will be detailed how-to's of how to accomplish certain feats, including many Screenshots and detailed walk-through's.  These will of course be major spoilers.  The first one will be how to duo Allizewsaur with two L50 Necromancers, and how to solo it following soonafter.<br>
-More to follow will be how to solo the named spawns in Guk, do quests, and more.<br>
-Guides on making Necros, race comparisons, and more.
<br><br>
Expect the first of these specials over the next two issues!

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
<b>Screaming Terror</b><br><br>
Screaming Terror, in its old form, was the first and only 'fear and forget' spell in the game.  When originally released, it brought great praises among Necromacers.  However, Verant began a series of 'nerfs', which eventually led to the spell not functioning at all.  Once again, Verant has altered Screaming Terror, completely ridding it of the Fear aspect of the spell.  It will currently mesmerise the target, the only general purpose spell available in the game that offers this outside of the Enchanter class.<br><br>
At a first glance, the spell has awesome potential.  Crowd control has now become one of the Necromancers forte's.  The spell does have its drawbacks in regards to the Enchanter mes; as it takes 60 Mana, 2.6 Seconds to cast, and has a recast time of roughly 2 seconds.  Nonetheless, this spell will see action in all forms in the battles to come!
