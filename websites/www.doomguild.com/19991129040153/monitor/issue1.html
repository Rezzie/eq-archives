Greetings..<br><br>
I'd like to take this moment to thank you for coming to the Necromonitor, the first newsletter aimed at the arcane art of Necromancy.  We'll be featuring news, stories, and events dedicated to Necromancy.  I'm going to try to put out a new issue every week or so, however this may vary as demand necessitates.  Please enjoy what we have to offer!<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Errant Quest?</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">
Not too long ago, the guides ran a sort of quest on the <b>Xegony</b> server.  Part of the quest was for some vile Hummies, High Elves, and Wood Elves to cross the Nektulos Forest from the East Commons zone to the Lavastorm zone.  While many of the intruders completed this part, some of the feeble intruders were too weak to run past our entourage of Stone Guardians and brave Guards.  The Guides then intervened, namely <b>Cypren</b>.  He began to use his powers to induce the defenders to slay themselves!  I submitted a report to <a href="http://eq.stratics.com">Stratics</a>, and Senior Guide Liantus retorted that the Guides did <b>not</b> intervene!  I am not sure whether he is unclear on his facts or just covering up Cypren's errant behavior, but I know what I saw!<br>
On a side note, I have been told that this 'quest' will be re-run on Friday, April 16 at 8:00 PM PST.  I invite our brothers and sisters to aid us in stopping the intruders!<br><br>

Its a well known fact that Necromancers are among the best solo hunters in the game, as well as excellent group hunters.  The reasons are simple: their pets, direct damage spells, and persistent damage spells.  Perhaps the best way to engage a critter is to strike with a persistent damage spell ( such as Clinging Darkness, Heat Blood etc ), send your pet after it, and then engage the critter.  After taking one to one and half bubbles of damage, back out and let your pet take some hits.  Use your direct damage spells ( such as Lifetap, Lifespike etc ) to regain your HPs to max, and repeat until the critter is dead.  However, take note to make sure you've enough mana to finish the fight!  This accomplishes many things, including saving your pet's HP ( however, if you're out of mana its wise to let your pet take the full brunt ), conserving mana, as well as making sure you've enough life to run if necessary.  You will quickly learn your pet's combat capabilities, as well as your own.  This technique takes some getting used to, but I have found it to be the best solo technique yet.<br><br>

<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="2">Pet Bug!</FONT><br><br>
<FONT FACE="VERDANA, TIMES NEW ROMAN" SIZE="1">The Level 12 Pet Spell ( Convoke Shadow ) is bugged!  The GMs on Xegony have been notified of this, however it doesn't appear that Verant is going to fix this critical bug anytime soon.  The problem is that the pets being summoned are extremely weak.  I personally summoned green pets when I got the spell at level 12, so have many of our counterparts.  It is also necessary to note that only level 12+ pets have a magical attack, so if you summon an extraordinary weak pet take heed when fighting magical attack-only critters!<br><br>
