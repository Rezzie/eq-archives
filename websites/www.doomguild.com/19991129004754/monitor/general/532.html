			To all Necromancers, <P>I have read in many boards on many different sites and all of them (to the most part) agree that we are basically "useless" after level 30 or so. I have only been playing my character a week and he is Level 8. I love this character, the class, and everything that I can do...however, I do not want to play this char for a few months and then find out that I am worthless to a group & there is no creatures I can SOLO on. <BR>Please reply to this msg and tell me what you think.

			Greetings brother.  I've been playing a dark elf necromancer for quite some time.  I'm just about to hit level 24.  I've read quite a lot of negative sentiment on this board about how ineffective necromancers are at later levels.  Obviously I can only speak about the levels attained so far.  I can say that I've enjoyed it immensly.  I chose to play a necro for a few reasons.  One of them was that I wanted to play a class that could solo well, and necromancers do this exceptionally well.  I'd say the toughest period for me was level 12-16.  Once I hit 16, I was leveling like mad.  I think from level 20-23 has been one of the quickest periods of advancement so far, and I'd like to add that I know *exactly* where I will be hunting...both now, and in the future.  This is actually a point I think needs to be addressed.  All the classes have their strengths and weaknesses.  I've found that I have the most difficulty in tight spaces (dungeons).  I think if you can find how to play on the strenghts of your class, and which monsters you are most effective against, this is the real key to gaining experience.  Perhaps things will get tougher at higher levels, but for now and the immediate future, I have no doubts I'll be able to solo very effectively.  <BR> I'm not going to get into the whole Druid / Shaman / Ninjadeathkiller debate.  I *can* say that I've been playing a wood elf Druid (currently level 11) and a friend of mine is a level 14 Troll Shaman.  I can saw without a doubt that I had easier times with my necro at those levels.  What I *do* love about my Druid is that its such a usefull class in a group.  I can heal people, and cast 'buff' spells.  I'm looking forward to level 14 when I can cast Spirit of Wolf and Levitate.  To me, its not a matter of better or worse;  the classes simply are designed to do different things.

			No reason to listen to level <30 necromancers when you ask what it will be like at high levels.<P>The answer is simple: it blows chunks.<P>Necros SUCK from 30 to 50 and thats all there is to it.<P>We rock from 1 to 29, but those are very low levels..  Anyways.  Im sure you will get another 10 messages from low level people telling you how they like their class, but then again thats not what u asked.

			Or close to it.  I remember earlier i was in a large group hunting minotaurs and i added almost nothing.  The best i did was when a Muddite joined the fray i DOT'd and Feared the little guy away.  Woo.  Fear is useful for scaring Frenzied mobs off the Wizards of your party, but if the group had to choose between the Wizard and the guy taking an even share of the XP by just casting Fear, well, can you blame them?  All the spells that would probably make us useful to a party (banshee aura, gather shadows, vampiric embrace, etc.) are self only.  <P>I do think a Necro can probably be useful in undead dungeons using their Ward Undead line to act like weak but very mana-efficient Wizards.  Unfortunately, if they can pick between a Cleric and all the buffs and healing and Ward Undead (generally better than yours) and a Necro who has just Ward and not even a lousy Root spell, i think it's an obvious choice again.<P>Necros just aren't built for grouping.  And Verant did indeed make this game for groups.  So, you are going to run into problems at high levels when soloing starts either becoming not an option or mind-numbingly boring.

			I am only a level 25 necro, and i have begun to starting the lake of a group ability.  Currently all i have in my spells is the shock of poison.  Whee it does 150 damage, not much to be proud of.  I cannot buff the group (except with spirit armor), and the only real accect I bring to a group is my pet.  Now with a pet he can pretty much solo a skeletal monk now, and he is good at die in combat to give the group a extra 20-30 sec addition delay before the mobs start killing us.  That is nice but never noticed like a healing spell, a buff spell, a SoW, etc.  Pretty myuch in my opinion of the necro is find a group you like that like you and stick to them.  That is the only way I have ben successful as a grouping necro.<P>Aaelnayael Gravedancer<BR>rank 25 necromancer<BR>Mithaniel Marr

			Just not with the same spells we use for soloing.<P>We can stop a monster from regenerating it's health during a battle, make it weak, and lower it's AC so our tanks can hit it easier.<P>We can buff the group with added resistances to cold and disease, we can also cure disease. We can also give our tanks a strength buff, and additional AC. We CAN heal other characters in a pinch, although that's not what we are good at. <P>Our darkness line of spells is even better than giving our group members SOW.
