Posted by Seneby on February 07, 2001 at 13:12:30:<p>
A few scarabs thought it would be nice if I shared this so here it is...<p><p>One must always remember the beginnings; their beginnings…<p>In a time long ago a young lass dreamt of dark dreams and stood high above a burning land in a tower of pain. Untouchable the girl was catered by evil and darkness alike, her walls adorned with the trophies of countless victims and the shattered remains of all those framed her ceiling; bodies suspended in time so that the sickened soul could enjoy their last final moment for all her dark eternity. But alas, a dream is a dream and dreams are always meant to be awakened from…<p>A long time ago when the world was young a wide-eyed girl new to womanhood was awakened from her dreams of darkness and given a candle to light her sleep from then on. It’s radiant light kept her sleep untroubled and she never awoke the following day plagued by the nightmares of the past.<p>A long time ago when the world was not so young a no longer wide-eyed girl happy with her family and her friends followed her duty over her heart and visited such pain and sorrow upon her own blood that did the candle break. With it broken the nightmares of long ago crept back into her heart and slowly extinguished it; her eyes no longer shined like they once did and her soul no longer sang as it too once did. Her family disowned her, her friends turned their backs on her. Only one had the courage to extend a hand or look into her abyss, save but one…<p>A time not so long time ago a faithful husband on a long journey found a tower of self-pity and hate. All around he observed the land was dead and lifeless, the trees burnt and the earth scorched. He originally had company, but they were weak and the journey hard so they too had gone away until only he remained to arrive in this desolate land. A tower of scorched bone rose high into the sky where the shrieking of a soul in misery echoed of the walls like some nightmarish heartbeat. For many days and many nights this faithful man fought his way up the tower’s many levels where many had previously tried but all failed and died; their last moments preserved in pain and shame in the tower’s walls forever; their very souls entrapped to stand guard over their dark mistress for all time.<p>A time only shortly before a man of faith and sight alone in a world of conceit thought of someone’s pain beside his own and risked much to spare another from an eternity of darkness’s embrace. Alone and out numbered he climbed the many levels of the tower of bone; each level telling another story of betrayal to a different tone of screams and horrid screechings; each level telling a different tale of betrayals, both by others and those by the woman who screamed so high above.<p>A time almost recent to now a man with great understanding only matched by his compassion walked into a chamber at the top of the terrible tower of bone and gave the cursed woman the one thing she needed to be free of her world of self pity and pain; he gave her a memory, a spark of their past when happiness was common to them both and the land wasn’t so scorched and the trees weren’t dead. As a glimmer of light returned to those long dead eyes the woman stopped screeching and the sobs slowed as the pain ebbed to a slow beat. The skies cleared a bit and for the first time in uncounted ages the world was quiet; in his embrace he as asked her if she knew who he was and she replied that he was the grain of hope and forgiveness on a beach of ridicule and self-pity. The man then asked if she knew who she was and this is what she told him:<p>Who am I...?<p>I am a ghost who let duty rule my life and plunge me into darkness...<p>I am a shadow of hatred who with but one word burned a forest of friends and left nothing for the soil to grow...<p>I am a dying memory of something once great and proud, but humbled by pride in the course of my duty, my devotion... I followed those above me out of duty into an abyss that I could not leave alive... so I died...<p>Who am I?<br>I am a lonely shade sustained not by pride, sustained not by duty, sustained not by devotion, sustained not by the strength of a god, only living on the sweet embers of a once loving memory about a sweet loving letch of a cleric...<p>Seneby <p>
