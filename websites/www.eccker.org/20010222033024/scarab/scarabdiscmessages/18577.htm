Posted by <a href="mailto:ggardiner@flashmail.com">Gyst Starblayze</a> on February 08, 2001 at 01:37:58:<p>
Listen my friends, for the time long awaited for has finally arrived.  For those with a mind to know and ears to hear, I shall weave an epic tale of the struggle one great elf has had through the maze of life's uncertainties.<p>The elf was known as Gyst, and his story begins long ago, in the dark mists of the Faydark...<p>After recieving a vision from Mithaniel Marr while building up his endurance by meditating in the fire pots outside Felwithe, Gyst made his way across the new unexplored lands until he arrived in Freeport.  Amid the foul stence and corrupt treachery, he found a beacon of hope, of justice, and of honor.  He joined this upstanding group of adventurers known as Scarab, and with the help of his many friends he began to make a name for himself.<p>However, from the very beginning, Gyst soon learned that it would be no easy journey.  Terrible failures plagued him as soon as I tried to establish himself in the world.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystRobe.jpg"></center><p>But Gyst wouldn't give up.  He wouldn't let a trifle as small as a pink robe hinder his progress.  He faced intense ridicule in this apparel, but he vowed that someday, somehow, he would rise above his situation and become the leading fashion figure of the entire world!<p>And so it began...<p>And thus it followed that Gyst experienced a prolonged period of soul-searching.  He tried to build a reputation and a good name for himself, while at the same time he searched his inner soul for the deep truths about his existance.<p>Naturally, his studies as a magician led him to the realm of most casters.  He soon found himself in a very snazzy robe, wielding his magical powers and bringing the forces of evil to their knees.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystCaster.jpg"></center><p>Although he had to wade through puddles of envious drool every time he visited Qeynos, Gyst did not feel right.  He just wasn't complete.<br>Something was missing, and he intended to find out.<p>After acquiring his grandpappy's old poetry book, he began experimenting with the vocation of music.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystBard.jpg"></center><p>But much to his dismay, he simply couldn't remember the tune of the mana song, despite his countless attempts to hum it to himself when no bard was near.  Furthermore, he noticed that often creatures would curl up and die upon hearing him recite a poem before he would even command his elemental to attack.<p>Gyst was disappointed, but he would not give up.<br>He began following the adive of Phil (and his cousin Gus, pictured) and he started making fashion statements at all the local weddings.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystWedding.jpg"></center><p>Yet for some inexplicible reason, people stopped inviting him to their weddings, so Gyst was forced to move on.<p>Undaunted, he focused his energy into another attempt.  In an intense campaign, Gyst devoted himself to the betterment of his guild.  A true patriot to the end, Gyst tirelessly campaigned for election into the Inner Circle.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RedWhiteBlue.jpg"></center><p>However, due to some minor technicality, Gyst's name did not appear on the ballot, and thus he was not elected.<br>After this further failure, Gyst fell into a fit of depression and eventually became a foul double-fisted drinker.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystDrunkard.jpg"></center><p>Gyst lasted in this state for several months, and only made his way out of it by abandoning his good principles and becoming a disciple of the ways of the Sith.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystDarthMaul.jpg"></center><p>Yet Gyst was good at heart, and he soon realized the folly of his ways.  It was then the epiphany occured.  Suddenly, Gyst's mind became clear and he knew what he must become.  He devoted his talent and energies into self-perfection, until one day he fully achieved the rank of Battle Master.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/GystBattleMaster.jpg"></center><p>Armed with his magical sword Nillabane, Gyst could cut through any opponent with ease.  His life was pure, simple, and beautiful.<br>But, it was not to be.  The gods of Norrath saw fit to take Nillabane away from Gyst, and his days as a Battle Master had come to a sudden and horrific end.<p>Gyst was crushed.  Heartbroken.  Ruined.<br>He almost returned to habitual drinking, but his friends helped him continue the struggle.  A long time passed and Gyst constantly searched for the true meaning of his existence... his true identity.<p>And by a twist of fate, the gods of Norrath made a mistake, and for a few brief moments Gyst came into possession of the Pimp Cane.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/UberBugStaff.jpg"></center><p>Although his experience with the Pimp Cane did not last long, it gave him hope to carry on.<p>He devoted his possessions and faculties into rebuilding a stylistic and fully functional wardrobe.  His stunning arrangement of apparel included all the latest trends (many of which he started), and the beloved "Mistmoore Farmer Twinked Alt" look.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/advisor.jpg"></center><p>And then it happened.<br>Finally, after all these years of searching, Gyst found his true calling.  He found his identity, his purpose, his joy.<br>With the help of the wise and noble Qyen Vimwarder, countless months of effort, and barrels upon barrels of money, Gyst obtained perfection.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/DiscoMage.jpg"><BR><br><b>Gyst became the Disco Mage.</b></center><p>Ah... perfection!
