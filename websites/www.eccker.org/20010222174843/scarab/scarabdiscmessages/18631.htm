I come before you tonight because an important situation has been developing. Due to my recent campaign announcement, the filthy forces of the dwarves have mobilized a counter offensive of crude propaganda against the upstanding citizens of Norrath and the wholesome ideals that have kept us together for so many years.  I fear that this may only be the beginning of some seriously intense hostilities.<br>I'm sure you are all aware of the constant presence of the dwarves. Somehow they have managed to spread themselves across the expanse of Norrath, and it is a rare privilege to find oneself free from the annoying presence of dwarves for a few brief moments. However, I fear that far too few of us actually understand the threat these dwarves present.  Thus, I have set aside the following week to be Dwarf Awareness Week.<br>Through this intense and informative campaign, I hope to increase public awareness of the Dwarven threat and to establish several counter measures against their ever-growing nuisance.<br>We must all know the magnitude of the threat, and most importantly, we must all know what we can do about it.<p>First and foremost, the absolute best thing you can do against the dwarven threat is to elect me to the Inner Circle in the upcoming election.  Once bestowed the official authority of that rank, I'll be able to engage countless large-scale efforts to purge our lands of the dwarven filth.<br>However, this is not enough. One leader can do a great deal, but true victory lies in the hands of the individuals. Only when each individual citizen of Norrath takes action into his or her own hands will our lands be free and pure. Dwarves may be small, but they are very real, and they are very dangerous. The best offense is a good defense, and so I have requested the services of the renowned monk grand master, Ran'un. He has graciously offered to explain a few basic self-defense moves which can be used by anyone against a hostile smelly dwarf.<p><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/Ranun.jpg" align="left">Thank you Gyst, it's a pleasure to be here. As I'm sure you all know, it is vital to know how to defend oneself when traveling in Norrath. Dwarves can be quite formidible opponents, unless you know how to handle them, simply because they are so different from most of the enemies you'll come across in Norrath.  For starters, they are very short, so you must adjust your tactics to accomodate for this. Also, they often possess an intense odor, and often can (unless you are prepared for it) render you stunned for long periods of time. Be wary when dealing with dwarves for the first time. My lovely assistant Thena Lonnes and I will now give you a few quick pointers about how to defend yourself against a vile dwarf.<p>First, we'll start with the most basic move... the punch. Punching is simple, easy to learn, and provides an activity the whole family can enjoy. But when dealing with dwarves, a standard punch rarely does more than ruffling the grimy hair of your opponent. Therefore, the key to punching dwarves is all in the stance. Notice how Thena first lowers herself in a poised crouch before she begins the punch. This brings her to the level of her dwarven opponent and still maintains her balance. Then, with a quick forward thrust, Thena plants her fist squarely in the face of her opponent. This type of blow is effective enough. Do not try to strike lower than the head, simply because the rest of the body is so hard to reach. Just be wary of the dwarf giving your hand a rabid bite.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/ThenaPunch1.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/ThenaPunch2.jpg"></center><p>Now Thena will demonstrate the kick. The kick takes a bit more practice, but once you master the technique you will be able to deal a quick series of damaging blows to your dwarven opponents. Dwarves are much lower to the ground than you are, thus they are able to scurry around rather quickly. So, when kicking dwarves, it is important to remain quick on your toes. Notice how Thena lightly balances herself on the balls of her feet, allowing her freedom to quickly dodge any attacks. As she lightly hops around on her feet, she is able to make quick, hard jabs with her feet at her enemy's head and torso. This method does take practice, but the results are well worth it.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/ThenaKick1.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/thenaKick2.jpg"></center><p>More apt fighters may want to proceed to the Flying Kick. Flying Kicks are more difficult to master, but a single well-landed kick can often completely disable a dwarven enemy. As with the previous moves, we must adjust our motion to accomodate for the dwarves height, or lack thereof. Notice how I begin the kick like I would begin a standard flying kick. This creates a false sense of security in the mind of your enemy. The trick comes at the last second, when instead of kicking straight forward, I kick down at a harsh angle, directly into the dwarf's brow.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunLeap1.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunLeap2.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunLeap3.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunLeap4.jpg"></center><p>And finally, the most formidible and effective combat move against a dwarf... the Drop Kick. A dwarf's size makes him an ideal target for this technique, and the results are often quite deadly. Begin by either grabbing ahold of a dwarf and flinging him into the air, or by having a friend toss a dwarf in your general direction. Then, with a small running start, run toward the falling dwarf and sharply kick him before he reaches the ground.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunKick1.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunKick2.jpg"><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/RanunKick3.jpg"></center><p>Pardon the pun, but the dwarves will get a real kick out of this move.<p><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/DropKick.jpg"></center><p>There you go. That should be enough to help you defend yourself against the next dwarf you see. Remember, it's better to be safe than sorry, so it is often wise to drop kick a passing dwarf before he has a chance to make a nuisance of himself.<p>This message has been brought to you in part by the Norrathian Purity Front, by annual financial support by viewers like you, and by the letter "T".<br><center><img src="http://www.guildscarab.com/gyst/Gyst2001.gif"></center>
