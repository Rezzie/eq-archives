<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp; This is a massive
quest involving most of the cities in Norrath.&nbsp; See the full quest
description in <a href="Q_Akanon.htm#Going Postal">AK'Anon</a>.</b>
<p><a NAME="Ogre Heads"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Ogre
Heads:</font>&nbsp; In the warrior guild in Kaladim there is a dwarf male
named Byzar Bloodforge.&nbsp; He is looking for the heads of the ogres
Zarchoomi and Corflunk who roam the countryside of Butcherblock.&nbsp;
If you ask Byzar "What about Corflunk?"&nbsp; He responds with, don't mention
those names, I hate those ogres and would pay handsomely for their heads.&nbsp;
He does the same if you ask about Zarchoomi.&nbsp; You must give him both
heads, and then he will say he underestimated you and give you experience,
faction, some coin and a decent item (often blackened iron).&nbsp; Your
faction with&nbsp; Stormguard, Kazon Stormhammer, MinersGuild 249 and Merchants
of Kaladim will all get better, and your faction with CrakenkWarriors gets
worse.&nbsp; He will then give you the Trumpy Irontoe Quest.</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Runner (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc Runner:</font>&nbsp;
Talk to the Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin guild
in Felwithe.&nbsp; Occasionally an Orc Runner can be seen running from
the entrance to Greater Faydark along the path towards the crossroads.&nbsp;
He is relatively tough (be at least level 8 if you want to solo him), but
usually will yield a sealed letter upon his death.&nbsp; Take the letter
to the Paladin Lord.&nbsp; Give it to him to receive a faction bonus and
the quest for Dvinn's heart.&nbsp; (Submitted by Tshober)</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Runner"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc
Runner No 2:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; This quest is given by Dill Fireshine after
you do the orc hatchet quest.&nbsp; You need to kill the orc runner and
return his damaged pouch to Dill Fireshine.&nbsp; He will also ask you
for a note which can sometimes be found on the orc runner.&nbsp; The orc
runner can be found in butcherblock.&nbsp; He runs around a lot, but the
easiest place to find him is by the two cabins hunting area. The faction
changes are as follows:&nbsp; Faction with Faydarks Champions, King Tearisthex,
Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of Tunare gets better, and Crushbone Orcs
gets worse. You sometimes get a pretty nice reward for this (sometimes
worth several platinum), and a decent experience boost.</b>
