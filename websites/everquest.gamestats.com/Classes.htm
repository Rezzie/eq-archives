<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of what class
to play is really one of personal preference.&nbsp; They all have advantages
and disadvantages.&nbsp; One major factor in your choice of class is whether
you plan on grouping or playing alone.&nbsp; There are some classes that
just aren't suitable to play solo.&nbsp; Read the descriptions carefully
before picking a solo class.&nbsp; Of course, every class is fun to play
in a group, and grouping is really encouraged in the game design.&nbsp;
Therefore,&nbsp; I would suggest you choose your class based upon how you
would like to play in a group.&nbsp; This needs to fit your personality
and how you like to play within the game.&nbsp; I see the classes in three
categories (with some crossover of categories):</b>
<blockquote>
<blockquote><img SRC="wpn129.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>&nbsp;
Fighter Types - or tanks as they are referred to in the game - including
Warriors, Paladins, Rangers, Shadow Knights,&nbsp; Monks, and maybe Rogues.&nbsp;
Clerics, Shamen, Druids and Bards can fill this role in a pinch, as can
the pets of Necromancers and Magicians, but not very efficiently.&nbsp;
These classes see the most action.&nbsp; They are always at the forefront
of every battle, and they rarely find themselves out of the action.&nbsp;
If you like wading into every battle, shouting bonzai, and hacking off
heads and limbs, this is for you.&nbsp; Because every party can use multiple
fighters, you will never be at a loss for a group.&nbsp; However, these
classes need less strategy to play (and may seem less fun to some) and
lack the means to travel and to extricate themselves from tough battles
that the magic classes have.&nbsp; The first time you have to run back
to town to buy stuff, you will really envy that magic user's gate spell.
It is also very expensive to buy equipment for most of these classes, and
heaven help you if you die somewhere where you can't retrieve your corpse,
forcing you to repurchase all of your armor all over again.</b>
<p><img SRC="symb005.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Magic Support, including Clerics, Enchanters, Shamen, Bards, and Druids,
and to some extent Magicians and Necromancers (though they really fit the
third category better).&nbsp; These classes, while possessing some offensive
skills (especially the Shaman, Bard and Druid), are far more valuable in
how they enhance the skills of other party members.&nbsp; Most of them
are very difficult to solo (except the magician, druid and necromancer).&nbsp;
Their primary role is to buff the fighters with enhancements and defenses
and debuff the monsters to make them easier to hit and kill, then stand
back and let the fighters do the dirty work.&nbsp; They are also very useful
for traveling, healing, sneaking around and other non combat related stuff.&nbsp;
You may enjoy these classes better if you are the type who likes to role
play more than just kill and level.&nbsp; The healers are also supposed
to keep track of the hit points of each party member and keep them from
dying.&nbsp; If you chose one of these classes, you should be happy with
the fact that while you may not be the hero that demolished the monster,
you were the one who made it possible for that hero to do his job.&nbsp;
Every party needs one or two of these classes, especially the healers.</b>
<p><img SRC="wpn059.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" height=32 width=32 align=BOTTOM><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Magic Attack, including Wizards, Necromancers and Magicians, and to some
extent Druids.&nbsp; These classes have the ability through firepower and
summoning to quickly kill monsters when the fighters start to get low,
and most importantly, kill off the monsters who break off and run for help
before they can summon their big brothers to whoop your butt.&nbsp; This
is especially true of the wizard, who has no crossover and really only
fits into this category, yet does it best of them all.&nbsp; These can
be soloed, but only with a perfect strategy and a lot of patience.&nbsp;
If you play one of these classes, you have to be prepared to sit back and
patiently bide your time while the fighters bash at the monsters, conserving
your mana to strike where it is most effective and, for necros and magicians,
directing your pet to the most useful area.&nbsp; You should also be prepared
to spend a lot of the game staring at the inside of your spellbook, meditating
to get back spent mana.</b></blockquote>

Bard</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Bards are almost always welcome in a group.&nbsp; However, be warned
that they do not make a great solo class.&nbsp; While they are not as good
at any particular thing as any of the specialized classes, they do a little
of everything.&nbsp; They also can cast forever since they don't use up
mana when they sing.&nbsp; Such ablilties as heal, find corpse, accelerated
travel and group invisibility make a bard invaluable group members.&nbsp;
While the bard only does one thing at a time, he does it real well.&nbsp;
If you are a social person who likes meeting new people, the bard may be
for you.&nbsp; If you like to go off on your own a lot or are shy about
travelling with strangers, you may want to think twice about playing a
bard.&nbsp; I once saw a pretty well reasoned argument on a message board
that the most powerful group you could put together would be 6 bards.&nbsp;
One suggestion.&nbsp; It costs you nothing but a little time to locate
a corpse for someone.&nbsp; Yet that can get you a friend who may someday
save your life.&nbsp; Don't be stingy with your locate song.</b>

Cleric</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is the most popular class in Everquest.&nbsp; Not for people
trying to play them, but for people trying to group with them.&nbsp; If
you play a Cleric you will have lots of friends, since a Cleric is an absolute
must for a well balanced party.&nbsp; AD&amp;D has ruined the reputation
of Clerics.&nbsp; They are such wimps in that game that nobody wants to
play them.&nbsp; This isn't true in Everquest.&nbsp; Sure, Clerics are
most important for their healing and curing abilities, but Clerics are
pretty decent fighters when given the chance, and you don't want to go
after undead without one around.&nbsp; Clerics are able to wear full plate
armor, giving them a level of protection unmatched by other spell casters.&nbsp;
Coupled with your heal spells, you should be able to keep from dying a
lot.&nbsp; One thing you should know is that Clerics are constantly in
need of money, because they have to buy both spells and heavy armor.&nbsp;
This is a class for the person who likes to socialize and wants to be welcomed
wherever he goes.</b>

Druid</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>There are three things that druids do better than others - travel
(camouflage, spirit of wolf, and solo or group teleports), damage shields
(great for long combats), and playing with animals (sense, charm, buff
them, terrorize).&nbsp; The other great thing about a druid is that, while
they are not the master of any one thing, they are the best class to fill
in the gaps that a party has.&nbsp; Need a healer?&nbsp; Druids are the
second best (tied with Shaman) next to Clerics!&nbsp; Need extra firepower?&nbsp;
You got it -perhaps only the wizard outshines her here!&nbsp; No Shaman
or Enchanter?&nbsp; Druids have decent buffs as well.&nbsp; Druids also
have the tracking skills of a Ranger.&nbsp; Given time to meditate, they
can buff you before combat, destroy creatures during it, and heal you afterwards.&nbsp;
No one else can do that for just one cut of the experience.&nbsp; Because
they have such a wide variety of skills, Druids are one of the better solo
classes out there.&nbsp; However, many of their best spells don't work
unless they are outdoors, making them difficult to play in a dungeon, where
many of the best items can be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Druids are also weaker
at each given area than the equivalent specialty class. This is a good
class for a person who likes to do a little of everything, without being
a master of any.&nbsp; (Thanks to Starkinder for the input on Druids)</b>

Enchanter</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The enchanter is not a good solo class.&nbsp; It has the weakness
of a spell caster without the attack powers many of the other classes have.&nbsp;
However, Enchanters are very valuable group members.&nbsp; They are sort
of an all around magic class, with a little of every type of spell.&nbsp;
They can buff you up to make you worth about another level and then buff
down the monsters to make them easier to attack.&nbsp; They have some limited
attack spells, and have spells such as root and lull which can make life
easier for the whole party in battle.&nbsp; With an enchanter in the party,
the group can take on much higher level monsters and get a correspondingly
higher experience and gold return.&nbsp; In addition, they are also supposed
to get spells which can create magical items, although many seem to not
work yet.&nbsp; The enchanter's main work gets done before and after the
battle, and although once the battle starts they often tend to hang back
and let the others do the dirty work, they have enough damage spells to
pitch in when needed.&nbsp; If you like to group, and don't mind being
the one giving support to the others, this is a good class to play.</b>

Magician</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This class is sort of a cross between a fighter and a wizard, because
they can fight with their pet elemental and stand back and cast like a
wizard.&nbsp; Thus, while not as strong as a wizard or fighter in their
specialty field, magicians are able to to do more than either one alone.&nbsp;
They are also popular with groups because they can summon food, water and
basic weapons, which always seem in short supply, and get the invisibility
spell fairly early on for easy travel and scouting abilities.&nbsp; In
some ways the magician's most valuable contribution to a group is as a
provisioner.&nbsp; Because a magician basically comes with a built in tank,
it is one of the best classes to solo.&nbsp; The biggest problem with this
is that you spend a lot of your time standing back and watching your pet
elemental do all the dirty work.&nbsp; If you plan on playing on your own
a lot, and don't mind playing a support role when in a group, this is a
good class for you.</b>

Monk</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The monk is one of the best fighting classes in the game, but it
does have its drawbacks.&nbsp; Because he can't wear armor, he takes more
damage when hit, and the limitation to hand to hand combat stops him from
using most of the cool weapons in the game.&nbsp; But the monk's natural
quickness allows him to avoid more hits than other fighters and hit the
enemy more often.&nbsp; The biggest advantage of a monk that I can see
is that if you die you don't really have to go find your corpse since you
don't need much stuff.&nbsp; You also will not be constantly poor like
most of the other classes.&nbsp; Monks dish out some incredible damage
since they get a lot more attacks per round, and have some really cool
looking moves built into the graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also get feign
death, which is a great skill for avoiding sure death, and can be used
to help a group survive a tough battle.</b>

<p><b>This is one of the best classes to solo.&nbsp; Of course, since most
NPC's hate the site of you, you may find it necessary to solo.&nbsp; Like
the magician, the Necromancer has the combined ability to summon a skeleton
to work as a tank and stand back and blast away like a wizard, but the
necromances has more powerful combat spells than a mage.&nbsp; While not
as strong as a fighter or a wizard in either specialty, the combination
of skills can be pretty deadly.&nbsp; The biggest drawback of a necromancer
is that you are evil.&nbsp; You can't even get a shopkeeper to sell you
food.&nbsp; There has been many a time where I've seen necromancers standing
near a shop begging other players to go in and buy some stuff for them.&nbsp;
Necromancers are also useful in a group since they give the group both
a tank and a battle mage in one package.&nbsp; This is a difficult class
to play, but is a good one if you want to spend most of your time soloing.</b>

Paladin</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The paladin is a combination fighter and cleric.&nbsp; You get the
attack abilities of a fighter and the spell casting of a cleric.&nbsp;
Paladins spend a lot less time sitting on their butt than regular fighters.&nbsp;
The Lay on hands skill is like getting a get out of jail free card.&nbsp;
Once per day you can avoid almost sure death by completely healing yourself.&nbsp;
In a game where you spend a lot of time looking for your corpse this means
a lot.&nbsp; While not quite as powerful as a warrior, you are still pretty
good at dishing out punishment and can take a pretty good licking.&nbsp;
Also, if the group doesn't have a cleric, the Paladin is the next best
thing.&nbsp; Like all of the fighter classes, Paladins can be soloed, but
are better playing in a group.</b>

Ranger</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Tracking makes this class really shine.&nbsp; This skill alone makes
Rangers welcome in almost every group.&nbsp; Foraging is also a nice skill
given to Rangers.&nbsp; If you have a Ranger you can find the monsters
that give you the best experience or gold without a lot of mindless wandering,
and you can keep a look out for the ones that will kill you on sight.&nbsp;
Rangers are also pretty good fighters and can readily play the tank.&nbsp;
You can't dish out or take as much damage as a warrior, and you are somewhat
limited in your weapon and armor selection, but you can definitely hold
your own.&nbsp; Because of his druid and tracking abilities, the Ranger
is one of the better solo classes out there.&nbsp; Tracking lets you pick
your fights and only engage the monsters you can beat, and warns you when
you are getting near something that can take you out in a hurry.&nbsp;
Besides the solo abilities, Rangers are also one of the most popular classes
to have in a group.&nbsp; This is one of the few classes for which I have
seen people actively shouting to find for a group.&nbsp; One thing about
a Ranger is that you have to be careful what you kill.&nbsp; You are supposed
to be a lover and protector of nature, and killing too many wild animals
may get you in trouble with your guild.</b>

Rogue</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Show me the money.&nbsp; All of the rogues I have played with have
disdained looting monster corpses since they make so much money pick pocketing,
and, since they are limited in their armor selection and have no magic,
they don't need to spend a lot on armor and spells.&nbsp; Never ignore
the benefits of wealth.&nbsp; Also, back stab is a great skill to have
when grouping.&nbsp; Let the fighter start in on the creature, get behind
it and stab it hard and fast.&nbsp; Oddly enough, considering that rogues
are generally not the most popular types with the public (many legitimate
vendors refuse to even deal with you), rogues are best when fighting in
a group.&nbsp; They can be soloed, but only with a lot of difficulty.&nbsp;&nbsp;
While they can fight fairly well, they don't fight as well as any of the
fighting classes, and they get no magic.&nbsp; It is their unique skills
that make them stand out.&nbsp; The backstab skill, poisoning, and the
ability to pick locks and remove traps make the rogue very valuable in
a dungeon.&nbsp; There are also apparantly places in the game only a rogue
can get to.&nbsp; This is a tricky class to play since it doesn't fit easily
into any mold.</b>

<p><b>This is a very difficult class to play.&nbsp; While it is basically
a combination of a necromancer and a warrior, it is not very strong in
either class.&nbsp; From what I can see from the skills you get, this class
really won't come into its own until quite a high level.&nbsp; But then
it will start to kick some serious butt.&nbsp; If you have the patience
to milk it through the lower levels and are willing to be hated by just
about everything in Norrath, you may enjoy playing this class.</b>

Shaman</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This seems to be a pretty good cross between a fighter and a cleric,
with a little wizard thrown in, and in a pinch can fill either role.&nbsp;
This is a class that can be soloed, albeit with some difficulty.&nbsp;
You have some decent buffs, which along with your heal skill makes you
a pretty valuable party member.&nbsp; Plus you have the added advantage
of being able to pitch in with a weapon and do more than token damage.&nbsp;
A Shaman is always welcome in a group because of his combination of abilities.&nbsp;
Since this is the only true spell casting class for the trolls or ogres,
it is a pretty good choice if you are set on playing one of those races.</b>

<p><b>While they get no magic, the warrior dishes out the most damage over
time, and can take the worst beating and still survive.&nbsp; This is the
classic hack and slash class.&nbsp; Your high strength lets you arm yourself
to the teeth and still carry around a lot of loot when necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Warriors get the highest physical attack ability of any class.&nbsp; There
are supposed to be a number of weapons and armor that only a warrior can
use.&nbsp; As a tank, the warrior is the best class out there.&nbsp; A
group will feel much safer knowing it has a warrior up front to take the
damage while it gangs up on the monster.&nbsp; The biggest problem with
the warrior is the complete lack of magic.&nbsp; You will really miss having
many of the magic abilities of some of the other classes.&nbsp; If you
don't group with a healer, you will also spend a lot of time sitting down
and waiting to heal back your lost hit points.&nbsp; You have to decide
if pure straight up killing is your thing.&nbsp; If so, this class is probably
a good choice.</b>

Wizard</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>Once you get attacked you are in trouble.&nbsp; But, if you have
some nice tank taking the damage up front you can really kick some serious
butt.&nbsp; Nothing beats the wizard in sheer attack abilities.&nbsp; The
pyrotechnics are awesome.&nbsp; That is until the wizard runs out of mana.&nbsp;
Then anything can beat the wizard.&nbsp; Every party wants to have a wizard.&nbsp;
They may just hang around and leach for a few battles, but when the going
gets tough, they can whack a monster to the ground in seconds.&nbsp; Also,
they are good at stopping monsters who are running away to get help.&nbsp;
The wizard is not an easy class to play.&nbsp; Because he is all attack
and no defense, he must approach a battle warily.&nbsp; But it is really
impressive when you take down that monster in one shot that the fighters
were battling for five minutes.&nbsp; Wizards can be soloed, but only if
played perfectly.&nbsp; If you play a wizard, be prepared to spend a lot
of time staring at the inside of your spell book.&nbsp; Also wizards, like
all spell casters, are constantly short on money.&nbsp; Those spells are
expensive.</b>
