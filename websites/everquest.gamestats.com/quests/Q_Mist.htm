Grimlot's Love:</font>&nbsp; This quest no longer results in the Electrum-Bladed
Wakizashi.&nbsp; I am not sure what if anything you get for this.&nbsp;
Lord Grimlot tells you about his poor, misguided beloved Arlena, who has
run away from him to Mistmoore castle.&nbsp; Being the sentimental type,
he wants you to track down the lass, kill her and return her either the
lute of the gypsy or her bones.</b>
<p><a NAME="Shadowknight Darkforge Armor"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Shadowknight
Darkforge Armor:</font>&nbsp; There is an undead knight who spawns in the
room with the coffin in the graveyard (although he seems a rare spawn)
who will make darkforge armor, which can only be worn by shadowknights,
if you bring him the proper ingredients.&nbsp; Be aware that he will often
get killed by other players, so you may just have to wait around from him
to spawn.&nbsp; Also, the rest of the armor can be found in Najeena.&nbsp;
Decaying armor is found on lizardman crusaders in Cazic Thule, and is no
drop lore, so you have to get it yourself.&nbsp; There may be a left and
right component to each piece.</b>

In the graveyard there is a tomb.&nbsp; Go behind the tomb and there is
a renegade shadowed man (he now follows Solusek Ro) who wants you to retrieve
a flower from the tomb for him.&nbsp; This is very simple - go in the tomb,
mind the floor traps on the sides and grab the little bag (the flower)
off of the top of of the coffin.&nbsp; This, when given to the renegade
shadowed man, will yield a scepter (necro only, magic, lore, nodrop item,
no stats) and a faction adjustment.&nbsp; +Faction with the temple of solusek
ro folks, and -Faction with the shadowed men.&nbsp; The flower repops every
minute or so, so if you are camping in the graveyard or tower, you can
run over and get a faction boost every once in a while.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Vampire Teeth"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Vampire Teeth:</font>&nbsp;
This is the current quest for the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Electrum_Bladed_Wakizashi.html">Electrum-Bladed
Wakazashi</a></font>.&nbsp; It is not easy to complete. The Avenging Catliff
is a non-aggressive npc.&nbsp; You don't need any faction.&nbsp; You can
kill him 1000 times he will be non agrro. You hail him and he glares his
fangs with a electrum bladed wakizashi. You ask him about the wakizashi
and he tells you he is looking for his mother and father.&nbsp; You ask
him "Who is you mother?" and "Who is your father?" and he tells you Maid
Issis
and Butler Syncall are captives in Castle Mistmoore and he wants you to
free their souls by killing them. He will reward you if you bring back
their fangs to show him that you freed their souls.&nbsp; Maid Issis and
the Butler Sincall are located fairly deep within Mistmoore.&nbsp; The
teeth are very rare drops (roughly 5% - and these two particular NPC's
are usually camped as well).&nbsp; Anyway, if you're lucky enough to obtain
the teeth (both of them), you simply give them to Avenging Catliff (who
spawns behind the graveyard).&nbsp; He will give you the EBW.&nbsp; And
since Avenging Catliff also drops some nice stuff, he's usually camped
24 / 7 as well (he gets to breathe Norrath air for about 3 seconds before
the spells and swords start raining in).</b>
