Message:</font>&nbsp; Theron Rolius, in the Hall of Truth, standing next
to the paladin guildmaster in the rear raised section, is the person who
initiates this quest. He asks you to meet a messenger named Mojax Hikspin
"near a lake in the Commonlands".&nbsp; When found in West Commonlands,
he is usually sitting next to the fisherman on the lake - the one that
won't talk or sell to you.&nbsp; He needs a flask of milk, which you can
get from the office of the people or at Greenleaf's in Freeport.&nbsp;
As soon as you give him the milk, he starts to hand you a note, but a fast
NPC named Duggin Scumper comes by, insults the Freeport king or something,
and runs off, yelling that You'll never catch him, and that he's taking
this to his superior in the Quenos Royal hall or something.&nbsp; In order
to get the note, you have to attack the man, kill him (he's around level
3 or 4) and loot his corpse to find the note.&nbsp; Then you return the
note to Eeyana Neastra, a sentry on the top level of the temple of Marr
(she may be in the Hall of Truth now).&nbsp; He is very tough to catch
without magic.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, sometimes if you stop chasing him and
return to Mojax, he will walk down the path to a pillar and drop the note
for you there.&nbsp; Each time you give Mojax milk, you restart the sequence
so that you can try again if you mis the first time.&nbsp; You get a little
gold, a item (sometimes a potion), experience, and increased faction standing
with the Knights of Truth.&nbsp; (Submitted by Saidan)</b>
