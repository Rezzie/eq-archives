<p><a NAME="Bandit Sisters (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bandit Sisters:</font>&nbsp;
This starts in Felwithe with the High Elf Paladin Guildmaster.&nbsp; He
will ask you&nbsp; if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"&nbsp;
Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you
are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).&nbsp; If you
say you are inexperienced,&nbsp; he tells you about a fallen member of
his order in Kelethin.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you say you are experienced, he
gives you the jojongua's pelt quest).&nbsp;&nbsp; You then need to talk
to the drunk named Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale.&nbsp;
His sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser Faydark who have
joined the dervish cutthrouat and are giving his family a bad name.&nbsp;
Being a good father and paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters,
retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all at once.&nbsp;
Beware.&nbsp; These bandits are pretty tough and will not willingly part
with their jewelry (approximately level 10 to 13).&nbsp; You will get experience,
faction and an item when you return all four necklaces.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Awen, Talison &amp; Zanshin)</b>
<p><a NAME="Bat Wings (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bat Wings:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Magician's guildmaster, Niola Impholder, is researching a spell and
needs some bat wings, 4 actually.&nbsp; Get them for her and you will recieve
faction, experience and a spell scroll.&nbsp; (Submitted by Aqulistor)</b>
<p><a NAME="Black Wolf Skin"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Black Wolf Skin:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Wizard guildmaster Tarker Blazetoss needs a black wolf skin for a spell.&nbsp;
Return one to him and gain faction, experience and a minor item, sometimes
a spell.&nbsp; Faction will change as follows:&nbsp; increase for Keepers
of the Art, King Thearisthex, Faydarks Champions, and decrease for The
Dead.&nbsp; (Submitted by Soren)</b>
<p><a NAME="Bone Chips (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bone Chips</font>:&nbsp;
The cleric guildmaster, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, will reward you for killing
skeletons and returning with bonechips. Return to him four bonechips (stacked
will work) for faction, money and an item, normally a first level cleric
spell.&nbsp; (Submitted by Turlo Lomon)</b>
<p><a NAME="Enchanted Longbow"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Enchanted Longbow:</font>&nbsp;
Talk to Kinool Goldsinger in the Enchanter Guild&nbsp; and ask him "Where
can I get an Enchanted Trueshot Bow?"&nbsp; Go throught the dialog with
him and you find that you need several items.&nbsp; 1) Faerie Dust.&nbsp;
Although this is in the order you actually get the details, you may want
to do all of the Antonica elements first and then do the Faydwer parts
to save a couple of boat rides.&nbsp; You need to talk to princess Jolena
of the fairies about this.&nbsp; Asking her about it reveals that one of
her wings was stolen by a bald person who smelled of rust and refuse. She
asks you to bring her wing back and she'll give you the Fairy Dust. In
Ak'Anon by the Necro Guild there is a Gnome named Sanfyrd Featherhead.
If you ask him where Princess Joleena's wing is, he will tell you that
you can't have it because he read that it will make his hair grow back.
He also mentions that he has no [friends].&nbsp;&nbsp; Patronize him by
saying "I'm your friend"&nbsp; at which point he excalims that you are
"just saying that to get my feather, if you are really my friend you would
help me get some hair tonic" (or something to that effect).&nbsp; Converse
with him further and he will give you a 10 slot crate to fill with hair
tonics.&nbsp; You then have to jump the pond to west freeport and visit
a gnome merchant in a tent outside the west gate by the name of Ping Fuzzlecutter.&nbsp;
Ping sells the tonics you need, so just buy ten and combine them.&nbsp;
Take the new box&nbsp; (no longer a container) back to Sanfyrd and he will
ask one more favor before forking over the wing.&nbsp; He will give you
his tattered toupee and ask that you get it fixed by the same man who sold
him the tonic (this is the meat and potatoes of the quest).&nbsp;&nbsp;
So once again jump over the pond to WFP to talk to good old ping.&nbsp;
NOTE: The wording here is important.&nbsp; You need to ask ping "can you
repair a toupee?"&nbsp; I tried the word fix and it didnt work.&nbsp; Ping
will go into the history of his wig, "The Mane Attraction" and tell you
that he can still fix it because it is under warranty.&nbsp; But in order
to fix it you need to fetch him two clumps of hair from a hulking gorilla
(the magillas in LTR of Cazic-Thule) and a lock of the golden tresses from
a "certain mermaid".&nbsp; This certain mermaid is a golden haired mermaid
(thats the exact name of the npc) that resides in Kedge.&nbsp; You will
absolutely need at least two well balanced 40+ groups to safely do this
(kedge is no joke).&nbsp; Once you retrieve the mermaid hair, u go back
to WFP and give Ping the 2 clumps of Gorilla hair, the golden locke, and
the wig and you will get the mane attraction (ac 4 +10 cha).&nbsp; Go back
to Ak'Anon and give the wig to Sanfyrd to get the glimmering fairy wing.&nbsp;
Take the wing to Princess Joleen and she rewards you with the dust.&nbsp;
I am told she will give you the dust even if she cons dubious. 2) A Treant
Heart. Wooden Hearts are dropped by Treants, but a ranger shouldn't attack
a Treant.&nbsp; Instead, you can get this by giving lanterns to Jyle Wyndshot
in the hogcallers inn in Freeport (which you did for the trueshot bow quest)
and about every fourth lantern or so he gives you a heart instead of just
treant wood].&nbsp; 3) Your TS Bow, and 4) 3000gp.&nbsp; The bow is called
the<a href="../equipment/graphics7/Rain_Caller.htm"> Rain Caller</a>. (bow

<p><a NAME="D'Vinn's Heart (Fe)"></a><a NAME="The Falchion"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The
Falchion:</font>&nbsp; This quest is given after you complete the Orc Runner
Quest.&nbsp; The Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin's
guild wants you to [prove yourself a faithful paladin of the court].&nbsp;
He asks you to present him&nbsp; 3 things to prove this, and you shall
wield "The falchion", a paladin only&nbsp; weapon.&nbsp; Bring him the
heart of Dvinn, find the supreme caster of the orcs, and also find the
supply crate at the supply drop point from the orcs to the Tier'dal.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Killing D'Vinn in Crushbone gets you his heart and killing the orc prophet
in Crushbone gets you a blue orc head.&nbsp;&nbsp; The crate is dropped
by Brarm in the Ocean of Tears.&nbsp; He is about level 22 and spawns once
per game day at 5am with 2 dark elf dragoons (approximately level 18 to
22) on the rocks with the Sirens just as you enter the Ocean of Tears from
Faydwer.&nbsp; Bring the items back to Lord Jyleel and he will give you
a <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Falchion_of_Koada_Vie.htm">Falchion of
Koada'Vie</a>.</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp; This is a massive
quest involving most of the cities in Norrath.&nbsp; See the full quest
description in <a href="Q_Akanon.htm#Going Postal">AK'Anon</a>.</b>
<p><a NAME="Illegible Scroll"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Illegible Scroll:</font>
Lord Jyleel will ask you to bring him an illegible scroll,&nbsp; which
can be found, among other places, on the Crushbone Orc Oracles.&nbsp; Your
reward ranges from a minor item to a low-mid level scroll. (Submitted by
Doriath)</b>
<p><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><a NAME="Jojongua's Pelt"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Jojongua's
Pelt:</font>&nbsp; The Felwithe Paladin guildmaster, Tynkale, will ask
you if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" if you hail him.
Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you
are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).&nbsp; If you
say you are inexperienced, you get the Tandan Nybright quest.&nbsp; However,
if you say you have been with them for awhile (or whatever&nbsp; [xxxx]
line equates to that) he will give you a quest to go to Innothule Swamp
and slay Jojoojojgogogoguna, the long-named huge Kobold lord in the aptly
named Jojongua's Tower. He is a rare spawn and drops a pelt called a Very
Large Hide.&nbsp; Take his pelt to Tynkale for xp, faction and an item.&nbsp;
The following factions go up:&nbsp; Clerics of Tunare, King Teristhex and
antimage.&nbsp; He will then ask you to meet up with a man named Tolon
Nurbyte.&nbsp; He is found at a local inn, and will spawn if you ask the
innkeeper who is Tolon Nurbyte.&nbsp; Likely this part is just a lead in
to the Princess Lenya quest in Highkeep.</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Runner (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc Runner:</font>&nbsp;
Talk to the Paladin Lord, General Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin
guild in Felwithe.&nbsp; Occasionally an Orc Runner can be seen running
from the entrance to Greater Faydark along the path towards the crossroads.&nbsp;
He is relatively tough (be at least level 8 if you want to solo him), but
usually will yield a sealed letter and a pouch upon his death.&nbsp; Take
the letter to the Paladin Lord.&nbsp; Give it to him to receive a faction
bonus and the quest for the falchion.&nbsp; (Submitted by Tshober)</b>
