<p><a NAME="The Bloody Shank"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Bloody Shank:</font>&nbsp;
Be warned that this quest can really mess with your faction with the deep
pockets.&nbsp; Visit the Captain standing out on a balcony in Highhold
Keep. Hail him and answer his questions.&nbsp; It seems a petty rogue escaped
the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The rogue's
<a href="../equipment/graphics6/Bloody_Shank.html">Bloody
Shank</a> was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives you the
shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to kill
him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the Deeppockets
in Rivervale.&nbsp; He may sometimes be found around the southernmost tower
in Misty Thicket.&nbsp; Hand him the bloody shank and then kill him, but
be careful because a bodyguard sometimes spawns next to him when you hand
him the shank and also the guards will help him if they are nearby. Handing
him the dagger and killing him lowers faction with Deeppockets,&nbsp; Circle
of Unseen Hands, Coalition of Trade Folk III and Carson McCabe and raises
it with Merchants of Rivervale.&nbsp; Return his head for decent money
and experience.&nbsp; You will raise faction with Highpass Guards, Carson
McCabe, Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos Guards and Freeport Militia.&nbsp;
There is also a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot on the second floor of the
Fool's Gold.&nbsp; When you hand him the bloody shank he does not give
the generic (Thank you.) response. Not sure what happens if you slay him
too.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ebaemnn o' the Rose and Kozmo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Eye of Stormguard:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Eye of Stormhammer:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest for the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Avenger_Battle_Axe.htm">Avenger
Battle Axe</a></font>.&nbsp; After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner
clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him "what important stormguard
matter". He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank
of High Pass keep.&nbsp; Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does
give you part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has
the other part, the "Emerald Shard".&nbsp; Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes
found in Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to
you if you do a small favor.&nbsp; Apparently a bounty hunter by the name
of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he
will give you the emerald.&nbsp; Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!&nbsp; He hops around
between the Orc camp and the wall.&nbsp; You may have to talk to Bronin
to get him to spawn.&nbsp; If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore
item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Frogloks
of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.&nbsp;
When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the
emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you a key
to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.&nbsp; The key is labeled H.K.106.
Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the
following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of
River Vale gets worse.&nbsp; When you turn in the key in highpass bank,
you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the
following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson
McCabe all get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronin also says "There is a [second
Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."&nbsp; Upon
further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare,
and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.&nbsp; In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about
the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The
only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting
"at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to
Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his
brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone
to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.&nbsp; Faldor Hendrys
is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front
gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. He may also
sometimes be found in Crows Tavern.&nbsp; You need to kill him to get the
gem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine the parts and you get the eye of stormguard, which
gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.&nbsp; If you give it to Beno,
he gives you a long speach about how wonderful a warrior you are and says
he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed by the ancient stormguard
hero, Jendl Mizebrite."&nbsp; He then will give you the Dwarven Avenger
Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.&nbsp; It is likely that
you need to have a very high faction with him to get the axe. (Submitted

<p><a NAME="High Guard Battlestaff"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">High Guard
Battlestaff:</font>&nbsp; After you finish the Peacekeeper Staff quest
in Erudin, Lumi will comment that you are ready for more advanced duties,
she says "We have heard that there is a person in the mountain keep called
High Hold who is hiring mercenaries to attempt to obtain a High Guard Battlestaff.&nbsp;
We are missing one of our staffs and believe this person has it.&nbsp;
Go to Highpass High Hold and find this person and return the High Guard
Battle Staff to me."&nbsp; She is supposed to give you a container to put
the staff pieces in, but I have been told she does not do it, so this may
be broken.&nbsp; Go to Highkeep and talk to the banker.&nbsp; She says
she will clear out old strongbox accounts if given the key. The key is
gained from an npc named Tallus Holton, who is located in East Karana.&nbsp;
Attacking him also draws his bandit cronies so I suggest a team approach
or a level 25 to 30 individual.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you kill him, you get a
staff segment (a lore item) and a Highkeep Strongbox Key.&nbsp; Give the
banker&nbsp; the key and she gives you a few gold,a little experience and
a faction adjustment plus one more staff segment.&nbsp; Combine them in
the box and return them to Lumi to get a High Guard Battlestaff (Not sure
of the stats, but I think they are Eru Pal Cler only,&nbsp; 5/33, +10 char)</b>

stands close to the entrance of the cellars, near the bank.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Library Book (E)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Library Book:</font>&nbsp;
If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine
light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book from the library. This
starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The librarian
tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows
the person who last checked it out.&nbsp; When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that
he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.&nbsp; He tells
you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.&nbsp; Once there,
she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.&nbsp;
When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.&nbsp;
Her brother is at Crows&nbsp; (It seems he is sick and is in need of some
Erud's Tonic.&nbsp; This is a side quest).&nbsp; Ask him about The Testament
of Vanear.&nbsp; He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold.&nbsp;
If you give him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory
slots and a combine button in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then laughs and tells
you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34 and the book is worthless without
them.&nbsp; He also says that the thief sold the pages to someone named
Ran.&nbsp; If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner
is a librarian in Highpass.&nbsp; If you go to Highpass and ask about The
Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a
man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man
wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in
Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had
page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and
go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in
and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one
npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starsine. Kill him and you get page
30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos
Quest in Freeport).&nbsp; Beware that any smugglers around him will come
to his aid.&nbsp; Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard,
+Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)&nbsp;
The faction hits for him are pretty lagre, so be aware after that of potentially
slipping to KOS in Qeynos.&nbsp; After going back to Qeynos, I went back
to Moodoro and said I want page 34.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said ahh so you figured
out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page
and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.&nbsp;
He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will
deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the
page.&nbsp; Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen,
Beggar, or Knight.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Note - keep the Knights and give them to
the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].&nbsp; Once the whole thing
is combined you get the <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Testament_of_Vanear.html">Testament
of Vanear</a> which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop
lore item.&nbsp; You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum. (NOTE:&nbsp;
I am told that you can avoid Erudin completely by giving Moodoro Finharn
2gp (the same guy that you get page 34 from) and he gives you the 2-slot
book of the testament of Vanear.&nbsp; Once you get the book, you can combine
the page you get from Moodoro (by playing his card game) and the other
page from Dylin in HighHold Pass and you've got the book!&nbsp; No need
to go to Erudia.&nbsp; And because Moodoro sometimes hangs out at one of
the sewer entrances, evil races could sneak in and get the book, too. )

<p><a NAME="The Lottery Ticket"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Lottery
Ticket:</font>&nbsp; In East Freeport go into Hallard's Resales (located
in the "bad" part of E Freeport behind the import store) and talk to Tohsan
Hallard.&nbsp; He will tell you about his special deal - bring him 4 orc
pawn picks (dropped by those pesky Deathfist Pawns in West Freeport and
the Commonlands) and he will give you 5sp and a Highpass Hold Lottery Ticket.&nbsp;
If you give him 4 orc pawn picks (not stacked) he gives you a few silver
and a Highpass Hold Lottery Ticket (NO DROP and LORE ITEM), which he tells
you is a non-winning ticket from last year's lottery.&nbsp; You get the
following faction changes for turning in the picks:&nbsp; Coalition of
Tradesfolk, Knights of Truth, Merchants of Qeynos and Coalition of Tradesfolk
III all go up, and no factions go down. Take your new lottery ticket to
Highkeep to the basement near the bank.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparantly, you randomly
get different tickets each time you do this.&nbsp; Go talk to the person
near the bank (not the banker) about something like the "highkeep lottery"
and he will send you to talk to Casino Treasurer Lynn who is nearby. The
treasurer says that last year's winner never came forward, but gives the
winning ticket number and says something about it being a person from Freeport.&nbsp;
Some tickets get you nothing, some are a "runner-up" and gets you a few
coins and tiny amount of XP.&nbsp; If the winning number that he gives
you is on one of the tickets, you get the key to the Royal Suite on the
3rd floor, a nodrop lore item. There is a locked door on the third floor,
opened it with a key, and where you will find a skeleton named "Tearon
Bleanix" who responds to questions about "Princess Lenya".&nbsp; It may
be that this is the new quest for the <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Thex_Dagger.htm">Thex
Dagger</a> since the old one doesn't seem to function any more, although
the beginnings of this quest were around before the patch that nerfed the

<p><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Princess
Lenya [New Version]:</font>&nbsp; This quest now seems far more involved
and probably gets you something a little better than the old dagger reward.&nbsp;
Part of it seems to be the lottery ticket quest above.&nbsp; I have seen
Princess Lenia in Lake Rathe by the guard tower in the cove.&nbsp; She
will beckon you ashore, and tell you that she needs a key and proof of
your good intentions in order to be free.&nbsp; If you ask Anna about Lenia,
she tells you that you need to talk to Martin and Tyrana about freeing
her from her imprisonment.&nbsp; I think they are both in Highkeep.&nbsp;
Martin will apparantly give you a key if you bring him a silk evening gown.&nbsp;
I assume this is the key Lenya needs, but am not sure.&nbsp; Tyrana drops
a container when killed along with a note to fill it with 3 fairy dusts
and a Sand of Ro and feed the results to the royal fish in Lake Rathe.&nbsp;
This fish is connected with Lenya because it says she will exact revenge
when you kill it.&nbsp; Also, if you Hail Lt. Rosead in Felwithe (on the
balcony - go through the secret door in the Paladins Guild) her will tell
you that Princess Lenya is missing, and have you seek out Tolon Nurbyte.&nbsp;
Tolon tells you to go see Tynkale, who gives the drunken daughter quest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is certainly more to this, but I don't know it all yet.</b>
<p><a NAME="Princess Lenia (HH)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Princess
Lenya [OLD VERSION]:</font>&nbsp; [I am keeping this description here in
case it ever changes back, but this version of the quest is no longer valid].&nbsp;
In the top of High keep is a Princess Lenya.&nbsp; The information I have
been given on this is confusing, but several people have told me that it
does in fact work.&nbsp; The princess of Felwithe has been taken prisoner
by Carson McCabe (ruler of Highhold Keep).&nbsp;&nbsp; She would like you
to help her escape - a reasonable request.&nbsp; First, visit a Tearon.&nbsp;
He is located near the front of the Keep.&nbsp; Say "I want to be a hero."&nbsp;
Pay close attention to the name of his princess.&nbsp; Next, seek out the
REAL Princess.&nbsp; She is located on the top floor of&nbsp; Highhold
Keep, behind an illusionary picture frame wall at the top of the stairs.&nbsp;
Hail her and give her the bracer you got from Tearon.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
you give it to the Princess (as proof), she says thanks, vanishes (for
about half a second), and you get XP and the following faction: KingTearisThex
(Felwithe King)+, FaydarkChampions+, MayongMistmoore-, RingofScale-, KingAythoxThex-
(???...hmm, could this be continuing somewhere?).&nbsp; She also gives
you the bracer, which is now AC 1 but which still can't be worn.&nbsp;
This is where you need a friend to help you.&nbsp; When your friend gives
the bracer back to Tearon, you get more xp, and this faction: ClericsofTunare+,
KingTearisThex+, Anti-Mage+.&nbsp; The princess should then appear next
to him.&nbsp; Give her the amulet from Tearon she will thank you and give
you a letter to take to Tolon Nurbyte, in the only inn in Felwithe.&nbsp;
Apparantly, the important thing is that the two people hand over the bracers
in rapid succession.&nbsp; That is, the moment the bracer is handed to
the princess upstairs, the other bracer has to be handed to the elf downstairs
before she respawns a second later.&nbsp; The method I have been told to
use is to wait to see the "you have gained party experience" message and
then hand the bracer to Tearon.&nbsp; If done properly, she'll appear downstairs
and stand there for a few minutes.&nbsp; She won't spawn at all downstairs
unless it's done nearly simultaneously.&nbsp; Since getting the bracers
is basically free, I would suggest you keep experimenting until you get
the right combination.&nbsp; Your reward for the bringing him the letter
is a <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Thex_Dagger.htm">Thex Dagger</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(If you give the bracer to the fake Princess, in the basement near the
prisoners, she reveals herself to be a dark elf, and gives the following
faction: CarsonMcCabe+, CoalitionofTradesfolk+, HighpassGuards+, MerchantsofHighpass+,
RingofScale-, but no XP.&nbsp; She then attacks you, so you have better
be careful).&nbsp; This quest is not faction dependent. As long as they
will talk to you you are fine.&nbsp; (Submitted by Sasbian Montar, Baroah

<p><a NAME="The Silent Watch:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Silent
Watch:</font>&nbsp; This seems to be the beginning of a complex quest.&nbsp;
At the end of the Princess Lenyaquest Tolon Nurbyte mentions something
about a 'you might be worthy of the Silent Watch after all.'&nbsp; Ask
him 'what is the silent watch?' and he says 'The Silent Watch was established
in the early days of Felwithe. King Tearis Thex had many cruel deeds to
do. The regular Paladins were too righteous to carry out any of the necessary
missions and we dare not bring in the Feir'Dal, after all, some of the
operations were against Kelethin. King Tearis formed our group. Koada'Dal
not of prim and proper breeding. Now we act as a secret guard and report
only to him.&nbsp; I don't know if that leads anywhere here or in Felwithe.</b>
