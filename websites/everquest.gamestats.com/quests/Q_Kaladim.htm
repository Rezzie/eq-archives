It would appear that the aviaks have been defecating on the huge dwarf
statue over the entrance to Kaladim and the dwarf paladins are VERY upset
about it.&nbsp; Bumle Reminjar, in Underfoot Hall, will reward you for
every 4 aviak chick talons you bring him.&nbsp; You will increase faction
with Clerics of Underfoot, Kazon Stormhammer, and Miners Guild 249.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Talk to a paladin in the paladin's guild and he will send you out to collect

get experience, guild faction and some money.&nbsp; Note that you must
be given this quest to complete it.&nbsp; Players with low faction will
not get anything by giving him bone chips.&nbsp; you will increase faction

Bundin's head:</font>&nbsp; This starts in Kaladim next to the "pit" or
arena in front of the warriors guild.&nbsp; The guy standing on the rim
asks you to hunt down and kill a guard Bundin that deserted his post.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He wants you to bring back his head and his axe.&nbsp; he can be usually
(but not always) found between the lonely guard outside the docks and the
ruins with the elf vendor and two quarelling guards.&nbsp; He is around
level 7, but hits much harder than his level, so watch out (I have been
told you may sometimes loot a fine steel weapon off of him).&nbsp; Also,
if you attack him near any guards, they may come to his rescue.&nbsp; Kill
him and turn in his head and axe for experience, faction, a small amount
of money and sometimes an item.&nbsp; Killing him will lower your faction
with the Kaladim Residents, so beware of doing this too many times. You
must turn in both the head and the axe.&nbsp; When you do, you will get
the following faction changes:&nbsp; increase with Storm Guard, Kazon Stormhammer,
Miners Guild 249 and Merchants of Kaladim, and decrease with Craknek Warriors.&nbsp;

task of "ridding him of that infernal Cleaner" and says he will give you
a "Miner's Cap" if you do it.&nbsp; The Cleaner clockwork is sometimes

<p><a NAME="Cromil's Remains (Ka)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Cromil's
Remains:</font>&nbsp; This quest is sometimes given to you after you return
4 bone chips to the paladin in the guild hall in Kaladim. He will ask you
to find the remains of his brother Cromil.&nbsp; Supposedly he is now undead
and is with an undead army located somewhere in the Plains of Karana.&nbsp;
You can find these remains in the Southern Plains of Karana.&nbsp; Cromil
is not actually a creature that is listed.&nbsp; It turns out that after
you kill a Putrid Skeleton in the camp where Lord Grimrot hangs out, one
of them might have a set of Dwarven Bones. These are in fact Cromil's remains.&nbsp;
Upon returning them to the paladin in the Kaladim guildhall, he rewards
you with some cash and a spell.&nbsp; Be warned that the location is in
a very dangerous location, as many of the creatures there are well into
the upper teens in level.&nbsp; Especially beware of the roaming cyclops
and Lord Grimrot, who is in fact the subject of another quest.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Eye of Stormguard:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Eye of Stormhammer:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest for the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Avenger_Battle_Axe.htm">Avenger
Battle Axe</a></font>.&nbsp; After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner
clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard.
He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High
Pass keep.&nbsp; Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you
part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other
part, the "Emerald Shard".&nbsp; Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in
Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to
you if you do a small favor.&nbsp; Apparently a bounty hunter by the name
of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he
will give you the emerald.&nbsp; Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!&nbsp; He hops around
between the Orc camp and the wall.&nbsp; You may have to talk to Bronin
to get him to spawn.&nbsp; If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore
item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Frogloks
of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.&nbsp;
When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the
emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you a key
to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.&nbsp; The key is labeled H.K.106.
Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the
following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of
River Vale gets worse.&nbsp; When you turn in the key in highpass bank,
you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the
following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson
McCabe all get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronin also says "There is a [second
Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."&nbsp; Upon
further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare,
and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.&nbsp; In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about
the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The
only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting
"at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to
Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his
brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone
to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.&nbsp; Faldor Hendrys
is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front
gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to
kill him to get the gem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine the parts and you get the
eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.&nbsp;
If you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speach about how wonderful
a warrior you are and says he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed
by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite."&nbsp; He then will give
you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.&nbsp;
It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with him to get
the axe. (Submitted by Sheba and Erondil and Bertran Headbasher)</b>
<p><a NAME="The Gnome Take"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Gnome Take:</font>&nbsp;
Tell Jeet that you will run to the gnome city (after doing the boog mudtoe
quest I believe) and say you will collect the gnome take.&nbsp; He will
then give you a key. You have to find a clockwork scrubber in Ak'Anon which
responds to 628 and use the key on him to get the gnome take. The scrubber
was down in the zoo area when I found him and responded by saying something
like wiz... tik... 628... You give him the key and your faction with clockwork
goes up and you get the gnome take. Then you take the gnome take to Jeet.&nbsp;
You get a couple of silver and a minor item for completing this quest,
plus faction and experience.&nbsp; (Submitted by Quegos)</b>

After you kill&nbsp; the gnomish clockwork "Cleaner VII" which wanders
Northern Kaladim and return his remains to Beno Tenarle, he will give you
a knight card&nbsp; which he would like you to return to the smith, Doran
Vargnus.&nbsp; Doran Vargnus is one of the dwarven smiths shipwrecked on
the Island of Erollisi.&nbsp; The island is located in the Ocean of Tears
between Kaladim and Freeport.&nbsp; The dwarves are camped in a small tent
on the southeast corner of the island. (LOC: 1280 -9245)&nbsp; Complete
the quest by giving the knight card to Doran.&nbsp; He gives you an item

as blackened and bronze, and even dwarven mail.&nbsp; (Submitted by Rexan)</b>

have to go to the Butcherblock port and talk to the girl on the end and
she'll tell you to find the two remaining Mudtoes, Boog and Goob, in the
Sea of Tears. You will find one named Boog Mudtoe (lev 17) on the island
right across from the all girl island of Erollisi. You kill him and get
his head and a note that is to his brother.&nbsp; His brother is on the
island with Gornit the Giant.&nbsp; He is a shaman and casts root a lot,
so you have to be careful attacking him.&nbsp; Take their heads back to

Turn in orc belts to Canloe Nusbeck in the warrior's guild for experience,&nbsp;
faction and minor money and items.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can turn in as many

just be treated like giving one item four times, so it is just a time saving
device.&nbsp; You can find these by killing orcs in Crushbone. Faction

those names, I hate those ogres and would pay handsomely for their heads.&nbsp;
He does the same if you ask about Zarchoomi.&nbsp; You must give him both
heads, and then he will say he underestimated you and give you experience,

After you give Byzar Bloodforge the two ogre heads in the ogre head quest,

he tells you about Trumpy Irontoe.&nbsp; He says he doesn't know where
he is, but that he had been engaged to his sister and ran off on her.&nbsp;
He wants his head for this affront to the family honor and promises to
make you an honorary member of the Bloodforge Brigade for returning the
head.&nbsp; Trumpy hangs out at the Fish's Ale in Qeynos.&nbsp; Your reward
for this quest is usually a bloodforge hammer, a very nice 2HB magical
weapon.&nbsp; The secret to killing Trumpy is you have to get him away
from Barstomper.&nbsp; In order to do this you ask him in the bar about
Sragg.&nbsp; He then gets all puffy and walks out.&nbsp; If you follow
him he will get quite a ways from the bar.&nbsp; You can then safely attack
and kill him. Be warned he will run away so a good root spell or snare
is a good idea.&nbsp; Also, he is in good with the corrupt guards and they
might help him if they see him getting attacked.&nbsp; Do not chase him
either he will come back if you let him and enventually he will run back
by barstomper and then you have a much bigger fight on your hands.&nbsp;
You must have a good faction in order to be able to get the hammer.&nbsp;
Trumpy's head is now a no trade/no drop item, so you can't give it to a
dwarf to get the hammer, but must raise your own faction to get it.&nbsp;
If you hail him first he will tell you about some beads.&nbsp; If you ask
him about the beads you will know if you have a good faction.&nbsp; He
may say that your shifty eyes tell him you are not good and in that case
you do not.&nbsp; If you do then you can give him the head and he will
give you the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Bloodforge_Hammer.html">Bloodforge

<p><a NAME="Tumpy Tonics"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Tumpy Tonics:</font>&nbsp;
Note that this quest is needed to finish the Trueshot longbow quest in
Kelethin.&nbsp; A dwarf name something Everhot who hangs around in front
the Kaladim bank and walks up and down the mine hallways very quickly will
talk to you if you hail him a few times.&nbsp; He tells you he's in a hurry
with working on his Dwarven Wire. When you ask about the wire, he tells
you he'll give you some if you get him two Tumpy Tonics from Tumpy Irontoe.&nbsp;
Trumpy can be found at a building in Kaladim on the right just before the
hallway where you zone to the bank; it's right across from Tanned Assets.&nbsp;
(there is also a Trumpy Irontoe in Qeynos who supposedly can fulfill this
quest).&nbsp; There is no identifying sign on the door or anything, but
when you walk in you'll see him standing behind a counter.&nbsp; Hail him
and he'll say "....if you don't see something, ask me and perhaps I can
make it" or something to that effect. Ask him, "Make me a Tumpy Tonic?"
and he'll tell you that he can make them, but that he needs kiola nuts
and flasks of water, and that Kiola nuts can be found in the island chain
in the Sea of Tears.&nbsp; After much asking about, you find that the island
you need to visit is the Island of the Sisterhood of Eollisi. When you
get there, find the vendor that sells kiola nuts, purchase your Kiola nuts,
and go back to Kaladim. Be VERY careful if you are going to fight anybody
here, everybody is strong!&nbsp; In Kaladim, give Tumpy the nuts and flasks
of water and he'll give you Tumpy Tonics (you get faction, I'm not sure
about xp). Take the Tumpy Tonics back down to the dwarf Everhot, give them
to him, and he'll give you a spool of dwarven wire (you get xp and faction).&nbsp;
The wire can be used for the trueshot longbow quest.</b>
