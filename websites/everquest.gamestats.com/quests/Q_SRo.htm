<p><a NAME="Bandit Tongues"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bandit Tongues:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This may not work anymore.&nbsp; In South Ro along the zone edge at 1100,
1428 is a 1-tent camp populated by a neutral Orc "Ortallius" and Wizard
"Rathmana Allin". Ortallius wants proof that you killed bandits.&nbsp;
Give him a bandit tongue for faction, experience and a reward.</b>
<p><a NAME="Evil Research"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Evil Research:</font>&nbsp;
If you are an evil magic using class, go to South Ro and talk to the female
Dark Elf who sells the smithing stuff.&nbsp; Walk up and 'Hail' her.&nbsp;
You may need a good faction to get this quest.&nbsp; She wants regular
lightstones for the books that give combine instructions and a greater
lightstone for the book that actually combines the ingredients.&nbsp; The
book you get for the lightstone is random and seems to be book one far
more often than book two, so bring plenty of lightstones.&nbsp; You get
some good xp for doing this and it increases faction with DarkBargainers,
DreadGuardInner and DreadGuardOuter.&nbsp; I have been told the combine
items don't yet work, so this is more for the xp and faction than anything
else.&nbsp; (Submitted by Maldaven)</b>
<p><a NAME="Ortallius' Cutthroat Rings"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Ortallius'
Cutthroat Rings:</font>&nbsp; Hailing Ortallius and talking to him reveals
that as a child he was saved from Dervish Cutthroats by Rathmana and he
now offers a bounty for the return of any 3 or 4 Cutthroat Rings&nbsp;
(he'll take either amount.&nbsp; There is a debate on whether it makes
a difference in what you get in return).&nbsp; Give him the rings for a
few minor items. Your faction will increase with Solusek Ro.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Rathmana's Business Offer (SR)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Rathmana's
Business Offer:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk to Rathmana about his [business].&nbsp;
He will tell you to give him the item and 20 gold.&nbsp; Nobody seems to
know what item he is talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted
by Zanshin)</b>
<p><a NAME="Rathmana's Travelling Offer (SR)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Rathmana's
Travelling Offer:</font>&nbsp; Talk to Rathmana about the [traveling offer].&nbsp;
If you give him 30 gold, he will allow you to reach into his scroll bag
and take 1 scroll.&nbsp;&nbsp; The scroll you get is random.&nbsp; It is
often an illegible scroll (take to Highkeep).&nbsp; Sometimes you will
get a high level (level 20 or so) scroll worth quite a bit.&nbsp; Your
faction will go up with Solusek Ro.&nbsp; (Submitted by Zanshin)</b>
