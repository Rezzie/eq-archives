<p><a NAME="Ged's Gloves"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Ged's Gloves:</font>&nbsp;
There is an NPC named Ged Twigborn who hangs around another NPC and they
will wander the forest at times. I usually see them in one of two places:
either along the same wall as the zone to the commonlands, or by turning
on the path off the main road from the sign pointing towards Freeport.
Ged will make you some gloves for a price. He makes ratskin, wolfskin,
bearhide, or lionskin gloves. All require some money and a specific pelt.&nbsp;
You need to be amiable with him to buy lionskin gloves.&nbsp; The <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Ratskin_Gloves.htm">Ratskin
Gloves</a></font> cost 6 gold and a giant rat pelt (ac 3 , negative 5 charisma),&nbsp;
the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Bearskin_Gloves.htm">Bearskin
Gloves</a></font> cost 25 gold and a high quality bear skin (ac 5), the
wolfskin gloves cost 13 gold and a high quality wolf pelt and the<a href="../equipment/graphics6/Lionskin_Gloves.htm">
lionskin gloves</a>&nbsp; cost 96 gold and a high quality lion skin. I
have been told that a tiger spawns some times in the south west corner
of Kith forest near the orc spawn and gives a high quality skin, and that
they are also dropped by highland Lions in NK.&nbsp; The gloves are good
for druids who can't wear metal.</b>
<p><a NAME="Grim's Tiger Revenge"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Grim's
Tiger Revenge:</font>&nbsp; If you enter Kith from West Commons, then follow
the right wall like you're going to Rivervale, Grim Oakfist is in a house
with an innkeeper near the right wall, not too far from the ranger guild.
You must have higher than indifferent faction with the Ashen Order for
Grim to give you this quest.&nbsp; He says there are three named tigers
in Kithicor&nbsp; that I believe killed his family. He is here for revenge
but cannot hunt&nbsp; them due to the rangers all around Kithicor. He says
he will reward you if&nbsp; you bring back the pelts of these tigers.&nbsp;
They come in different parts of the woods, one even keeps&nbsp; roaring.&nbsp;
They spawn after you talk to Grim. So the easiest way to find these tigers
is with a tracker-- but killing these tigers gives a hit to ranger/druid
faction. The tigers are around level 25, but they hit in the 40's and each
one drops a strange or unusual tiger pelt.&nbsp; When you return the three
pelts to Grim he thanks you and gives you a <a href="../equipment/graphics8/Collar_of_Neshika.htm">Collar
of Neshika</a>.</b>

of Kithicor” and a Star of Odus, which can be purchased in Erudin.&nbsp;
To get the quiver, go to Kelethin and speak with Leutenant Leafstalker
who tells you to collect 6 different named arrows (Acknowledgment, bravery,
defiance, gallantry, fortitude and recognition) from the Outcast Brownies
in Lesser Faydark (Kill Pixe Tricksters and Pranksters to get the spawn).&nbsp;
Then go to OOT and to Seafury Isle. Kill the Buccaners until Miltin the
thief spawns (he is a very rare spawn) and kill him, hoping that he drops
the Quiver. Get the Quiver and combine the 6 Arrows.&nbsp; Return the Quiver
to Leaf in Kithicor along with the star.</b></li>

<p><br><a NAME="Morin's Sword"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Morin's Sword:</font>&nbsp;
Morin Shadowbane, the multisexual ranger guildmaster of the forest, sends
you on a Quest for the new Ranger only weapon, the Short Sword of Morin.&nbsp;
There are two ways to get the sword.&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; If you trade in an
Ebony Bladed Sword to Morin, you will get a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics6/Short_Sword_of_Morin.htm">Short
Sword of Morin</a></font> , a Ranger only weapon; or&nbsp; (2) She will
also tell you that she will give you her personal sword if you find and
kill the Ghoul Messenger, who is located "between Kithicor and the Karanas"
and bring back his note, or whatever he drops.&nbsp; The messenger spawns
somewhere in Western Karana, is tough to anyone not in his 30's, and is
always running.&nbsp; He drops a map of Kithicor.&nbsp; Take that map back
and you will also receive the sword.&nbsp; You get the same sword for doing
this as for trading the Ebony Bladed Sword. (Submitted by Anaxagoras Ionia)</b>
