<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fishing can be a very useful and lucrative skill
to have, especially at lower levels.&nbsp; Just be aware that, much like
real life, you will spend a lot of time in one spot constantly throwing
your line in and out of the water hoping to get a bite.&nbsp; This can
be pretty boring, but if you don't mind being bored, you can make some
extra cash.&nbsp; This is probably the easiest of the secondary skills
to learn and train.&nbsp; All you need is a fishing pole and some bait
and you are ready to head to the nearest body of water and start fishing.&nbsp;
Some would advocate putting a few skill points here to avoid the risk of
breaking your pole.&nbsp; Personally, I would rather lose a few gold pieces
than some skill points.&nbsp; You can eventually recover the lost gold.&nbsp;
As far as I can tell, you can catch one of four things:&nbsp; a generic
fish (worth about 2 silver pieces), a fish scale (worth about 4 copper
pieces), a rusty dagger (worth about 1 &frac12; silver pieces) or a tattered
shoe (worth about 1 silver piece) .&nbsp; While you're fishing you can
talk to the people around you or practice your spells and other skills.&nbsp;
Remember to sell your fish as soon as possible before the temptation overwhelms
you and you start to eat them.&nbsp; This skill is especially useful for
races such as Erudites who live on an island and spend a lot of time either
waiting for a boat or riding it to another town.&nbsp; Between the time
on the dock and the time on the boat, I estimate that the trip to Qeynos
garners me about an extra gold piece each time. Note that the fish scales
are used in the enchanter water breathing spell, so alot of times you can
get good money for them from an enchanter of adaquete level to use them.</b>
