Hold:</font></font></font></b></center>

<blockquote><b><font color="#FF0000">Level Range:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
15 - 30</b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Typical Creatures:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
Orcs (orc soldier, orc warrior, orc conscript, orc medic (magic-user),
orc mercenary, orc fanatic (magic-user), and a named orc that carries the
Shiny Brass Halberd) and Gnolls (A Gnoll, Gnoll Brawler, Gnoll Shaman,
Gnoll Soothesayer, Gnoll FlamePaw, Gnoll Champion, Named Gnoll), smugglers.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">NPC's and Quests:&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">Two
named gnolls and two named orcs who spawn infrequently and who drop some
of the most sought-after mid-level items in the game: The Polished Granite
Tomahawk, the Darkwood Shield, the Shiny Brass Halberd, and the Shralok
Pouch.&nbsp; There are also 3 named smugglers in the center of the zone:
Brenon, Dalishea, and Greth Truksorm</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">This
zone is treated as a city zone for the purposes of binding, so a non magic
user can get bound here.&nbsp; This is a festive little zone.&nbsp; It's
got a couple of inns and taverns, a weapons shop, a merchant who sells
pottery sketches, another merchant who sells pottery supplies, and a number
of merchants who sell alcoholic drinks.&nbsp; If you're a potter, Highpass
Hold is one of the most underrated places in Norrath to do pottery.&nbsp;
It's one of only three places where you can do single-zone pottery (i.e.
where you can buy all your supplies in the same zone containing the wheel
and kiln), and there are three wheels and three kilns in the zone.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">The biggest attraction of the zone for players
in the appropriate level range, however, are the gnolls and orcs who spawn
at opposite ends of the zone. The orcs spawn near the exit to the Kithicor
Forest, in a fairly tight cluster of spawn points.&nbsp; The orcs have
a crazy fast respawn rate, and the orcs that spawn range from the lowly
conscripts (around 13th level) to the mighty orc fanatics (22nd level).&nbsp;
A good group can park themselves near the spawn points and rake in the
XP and loot. The gnolls spawn near the exit to Eastern Karana, and their
spawn points are much more spread out.&nbsp; Moreover, they don't spawn
nearly as quickly as the orcs.&nbsp; So folks who are hunting gnolls have
to do a lot of running around.&nbsp; The gnolls also don't have as much
variety as the orcs, ranging from the basic "a gnoll" (11th-12th level)
to the gnoll flamepaws and gnoll champions (both around 19th level).&nbsp;
Both gnolls and orcs occasionally drop ringmail pieces and the occasional
bronze weapon.&nbsp; They also occasionally drop scalps, which can be turned
into the captain at the appropriate gate (the Captain near the gnoll spawn
points will take gnoll scalps, and the Captain near the orcs will take
orc scalps) for up to 5 gold.&nbsp; This is also one of the few ways known
to improve your faction with the Corrupt Qeynos Guards and the Freeport
Militia.&nbsp; The best time to hunt the orcs and gnolls in this zone,
especially for melee classes, is during off-peak hours when the competition
for kills is scarce.&nbsp; During peak hours the zone becomes a free-for-all,
with everybody attacking the spawns and to the victor go the spoils.&nbsp;
Kill-stealing is rampant during peak hours and whining about kill-stealing
is frowned upon. During off-peak hours, things are a little more friendly,
with people helping each other out, rotating kills, respecting the kills
of others, and so on.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">In the middle of the zone, in a cave across
from the keep, are three named smugglers that have been the death of more
than one unwary traveller.&nbsp; The toughest of these is Dalishea, who
is 18th level.&nbsp; Her partners Greth and Brenon are 16th and 13th, respectively.&nbsp;
They sometimes drop bronze weapons.&nbsp; They spawn slowly, and therefore
aren't camped very often.&nbsp; Also, a little-known part of this zone
is the smuggler's cove.&nbsp; If you dive into the water near the Tiger's
Roar Inn, you can find an underwater passageway that leads to a secret
cove filled with smugglers and one corrupt Qeynos guard.&nbsp; The smugglers
where either green or red to a 16th level character, so I'm unsure of their
level.&nbsp; The smugglers were, at the time, "glowering dubiously" at
me, so I (an Erudite Magician) wasn't KOS to them.&nbsp; Which is good
because they've got a kiln, a pottery wheel, an oven, and a forge in their
cove.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">Traveller's Note:&nbsp; On the older servers,
this zone is pretty well camped on both the orc and gnoll sides, which
means that low-level characters can survive the trip through the zone without
significant difficulty.&nbsp; On the newer servers, where there aren't
enough players high enough to camp the zone, Highpass is a death trap for
low level (and even medium level) characters.&nbsp; If you're travelling
through this zone, do a "/who" command and see how many players are there.&nbsp;
If it's 15 or more, you're probably safe.&nbsp; If it's less than 15, you'll
probably either want to take the Runnyeye/Beholder route or become invisible.&nbsp;
