<br><a NAME="Ocean of Tears"></a><b><font face="Kaufmann Bd BT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Ocean
of Tears</font></font></font></b></center>

<blockquote><b><font color="#FF0000">Level Range:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
10-30</b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Typical Creatures:&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">Sharks,
buccaneers, bandits, aviaks, cyclops, Ogres (Moog and Boog), pirates, giants,
goblins.</font></b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">NPC's and Quests: </font><a href="../../quests/Q_OTears.htm#The Mudtoes (Eo)" TARGET="_self">The
Mudtoes</a>; <a href="../../quests/Q_OTears.htm#Sentry Xyrinn (OT)" TARGET="_self">Sentry
Xyrinn</a>;</b>
<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">The
ocean you cross when travelling between Antonica and Faydwer.&nbsp; Mostly
water, but there are several islands with various nasties on them. Karean
of Karana, the seafearing dwarf, scouted out this zone as follows:&nbsp;
Monsters by Island:&nbsp; </font><u><font color="#000066">Erollisi Island:</font></u><font color="#000000">
You will find 5-6 high level named NPC's near the dock area. There is also
a Dwarven Blacksmith on the west side of the Island with one of his friends.
Scattered on the island are some Sisters of Erollisi.&nbsp; They wil sell
to you and are involved in several quests.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><u><font color="#000066">Pirate
Island:</font></u><font color="#000000"> There is a single Pirate on an
island right west of the the Erollisi Island.&nbsp; He was red at level
17 and aggressive. One of the Mudtoe Ogres can sometimes be found here.
On the Island there is also a shopkeeper selling Magician spells. </font><u><font color="#000066">Cyclops
Island:</font></u><font color="#000000"> North of the Pirate Island is
an island filled with Sea Fury Cyclops. I didn't get near one because they
coned red and were aggressives. There seems to be a circle of teleportation
for druids on the island as well, but if I was a druid, I wouldn't want
to teleport into the middle of 4 cyclops. On the north shore of the Island
is a named Giant. I didn't approach him since I'm used to Oasis, but he
seemed to be peaceful enough. The second Mudtoe Ogre spawns on this Island.
</font><u><font color="#000066">Death
Island:</font></u><font color="#000000"> Very dangerous.&nbsp; There are
the standard four spectres guarding a spire at the top of this&nbsp; rocky
hill of an island.&nbsp; There are also a series of spawn points where
either greater skeletons or gargoyles appear.&nbsp; The gargoyles are the
same as&nbsp; grinning gargoyles in Castle Mistmoore, and occasionally
drop gargoyle eyes. The gargoyles, when left to their own, will destroy
the skeletons, so if&nbsp; you camp at this island, it's wise to leave
with one gargoyle roaming, so when you return there will be all gargs and
no skellies. </font><u><font color="#000066">Goblin Island:</font></u><font color="#000000">
South of the pirate Island, this one is full of Isle Goblins. They range
in levels from about 17 to 23. Beware. Also on the Island are 2 NPCs including
an Oracle of some sort.&nbsp; He is involved in a couple quests and also
drops the oracle robe if killed. </font><u><font color="#000066">First
Island from Kaladim to Freeport:</font></u><font color="#000000"> This
island is devoid of everything except an Inn and a Shopkeeper and is southwest
of the Aviak Island.</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font><u><font color="#000066">Aviak
Island:</font></u><font color="#000000"> An island full of parrot-looking
aviak.&nbsp; There are 4 types of aviaks.&nbsp; Starlings are around level
10, Turacos are level 15ish, Tanagers are around level 20, and Quetzels
are around level 25.</font></b>
