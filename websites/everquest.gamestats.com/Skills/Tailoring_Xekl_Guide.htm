<br><b><font size=+2>Xekl's Guide to All About Tailoring</font></b></center>

<p><b>First let me say that Tailoring is a very difficult skill to raise
in both time spent and platinum invested in the trade but I do think it
is a great moneymaker once you get it high enough. It is not totally out
of whack like many ppl think; it's just harder than other skills. Of all
my skills, tailoring is the one I'm most proud of. There are hundreds of
Master blacksmiths and Jewelers on my server but only one master tailor,
me.</b>
<p><b>When do things become trivial?</b>
<br><b>Patchwork: 26</b>
<br><b>Studded: 68</b>
<br><b>Backpacks: 90</b>
<br><b>Reinforced: 122</b>
<p><b>There are no patterns for Masks, Belts, Shoulders, and Capes despite
the recepies in the book.</b>
<p><b>here are no recepies for Quivers and Fleeting Quivers despite the
patterns being available.</b>
<p><b>Studded tunics are broken and can't be made. Reinforced tunics work
however.</b>
<p><b>AC and weights (medium armor)</b>
<p><b>Patchwork:</b>
<br><b>Boots: AC 3, wt 2.5</b>
<br><b>Cap: AC 3, wt 0.6</b>
<br><b>Gloves: AC 3, wt 1.5</b>
<br><b>Gorget: AC 2, wt 0.5</b>
<br><b>Pants: AC 4, wt 3.0</b>
<br><b>Sleeves: AC 3, wt 1.5</b>
<br><b>Tunic: AC 6, wt 4.4</b>
<p><b>Studded</b>
<br><b>Boots: AC 4, wt 2.5</b>
<br><b>Cap: AC 5, wt 0.6</b>
<br><b>Gloves: AC 4, wt 1.5</b>
<br><b>Gorget: AC 3, wt 0.5</b>
<br><b>Pants: AC 5, wt 4.0</b>

<br><b>Boots: AC 5, wt 2.5</b>

<br><b>Sleeves: AC 5, wt 1.5</b>
<br><b>Tunic: AC 11, wt 3.5</b>
<p><b>To become a successful tailor you must also become a blacksmith (or
be very good friends with one).&nbsp; The Best class to be for tailoring
is either a Wizard or a Druid. This is because you do a LOT of traveling
and wizards and druids can teleport themselves all over.&nbsp; Once Patchwork
becomes trivial you need to move to studded armor. There is no profit in
studded and it is VERY time consuming and costs a lot of platinum, but
is needed to advance on to making Reinforced armor, your best consistant
moneymaker.</b>
<p><b>To make studded armor you need medium pelts. The best place I found
for medium pelts is in the deserts of Ro and the Oasis. Pumas give both
Puma skins and medium quality pelts. I found about 1 in 4 pumas will yeild
a medium pelt. If you're lucky you can find a merchant loaded with medium
pelts. Check the Inn and Fishing Village in N. Ro and the Gypsy Merchants
and the Inn in Oasis (near P2). Medium quality pelts can be bought from
merchants for 114cp with 100 charisma. The Freeport area is a good place
to work on studded because of the availability of medium quality pelts
and ore for blacksmithing the studs. I found the best way to go about it
is to empty out all of your backpacks, buy 200 waters and 600 small ores
(all stackable). This will make around 180 metal bits (200 if you have
no failures). Once you have these metal bits, buy 1 water per 3 metal bits
and make studs. This may yeild about 50 studs. Studs do not stack btw.
Take your studs and large sewing kit and gorget patterns (buy 1 pattern
for every 2 studs) and move to the deserts to find your pelts. 50 studs
will yeild 25 attempts at making studded, which will probably give you
5-10 skill increases, depending on intellect.</b>
<p><b>Relax now, it gets easier at this point. You can continue doing studded
till it trivials out at 68. But studded is such a pain in the butt so I'd
suggest after getting it to around 45 or so, start working on reinforced.
To make Reinforced you need steel boning. This becomes trivial at 41 for
blacksmiths but I raised my blacksmithing to 60 and I think it helped my
success rate for making steel boning. To make steel boning you need one
brick of ore, 1 water, and 1 file. The file is reusable. Again, like studded,
I empty out all my backpacks and buy about 40 waters, take my file out
the bank and go buy as many ores as I can hold. Ores are VERY heavy and
you will be so encumbered that you cannot walk, unless you have SoW cast
on you, otherwise only buy maybe 1 backpack full at a time. Then slowly
move from the merchant to the forge and make your steel boning. Once you
get a bunch of steel boning you need to find High Quality Pelts. These
are very abundant in the Karanas, so head to west karana and check out
the village merchants there. Try the small village near Qeynos Hills and
the one near T2. If these are empty I found a nice supply in North Karana
at the Gypsy camp and also in East karana at the village near the Beholder
zone entrance and the village to the right as you come off the wooden bridge
at the fork in the road. Again you can see how much traveling you need
to do.</b>
<p><b>Once you get your skill up high enough (80+) you can now start making
backpacks. These are a very good profit item. Save all of your High Quality
Bear Skins till you get your skill in tailoring up real high. I sell these
for 50pp each. HQ Bear Skins come off Black and Brown bears only. Grizzly
and Kodiak bears will yeild Grizzly Skins. The best places to find black
and brown bears are in West Karana, Rathe Mountains, and the Commons. I
offer 10pp each for all the HQ bear skins, but you can probably get away
with offering 2pp-5pp (I like to keep the competition away). Keep in mind
that HQ Bear skins are used for the Bear Cloaks, so if you see someone
else auctioning for them it's either a budding tailor who wants to TRY
to make a backpack or someone who wants to do the bear cloak quest.</b>
<p><b>Once I get a bunch of HQ Bear skins, I'll take my sewing kit, patterns,
and skins to a high level zone such as Mistmoore, Lower Guk, Sol A, Sol
B, etc. and auction. If you try to auction a 10 slot backpack in a low
level zone for 50pp everyone will laugh at you. This item is for the high
level rich people. They aquire a lot of items and desparately need more
room to store it. Usually when I find a buyer they want 8-10 at a time.
8 for their bank vault and 2 to carry. So if your skill in tailoring is
low and you risk losing a HQ bear skin to make a backpack, chances are
you will fail and that is a potential 50pp you just threw away.</b>
<p><b>Now what else is there to make money on in tailoring besides backpacks?
Well, backpacks may be your best single moneymaker but you don't sell these
in mass quantity. I make Reinforced Leggings, Sleeves, Gloves, and Tunics
and sell them for 10pp each. Your best customers are Druids. Druids can
only wear leather and Reinforced is better than the best leather they can
buy. There are much better things they can wear at higher levels though,
so your target is the mid level druids who don't mind spending 10pp. I
cater to mostly lvl 15-30 druids and best places to sell are in Greater
Fay and North Karana.</b>
<p><b>Caps, Boots, and Gorgets don't sell cause there are other items such
as Savant's cap, Bearhide boots, and Studded Leather Gorget (from Blackburrow)
that's easier to get and cost less. Sometimes I come across some ppl who
want reinforced for the status (no one else has it). There are so few tailors
who can make reinforced as many give up at skill 30 or so. I am probably
the only master tailor on my server (xegony).</b>
<p><b>So, despite all the complaints about tailoring it is a nice moneymaking
skill once you get it up high enough. It's just hard to raise.</b>
<p><b>Now what would I change? First I'd put in the mask, belt, shoulder,
and cape patterns. Then I'd provide recepies for quivers and fleeting quivers.
I'd also allow tailors to make leather. Let studded become trivial at 45
or so, then let tailors make leather from 45 to 68.&nbsp; However the greatest
change they could make to tailoring is to make studs and steel boning stackable
AND make them available from a vendor. One skill should not have to rely
so heavily on another.</b>
