<b><i>Sabrael leaned her chair back against the wall, closed her eyes,
and sighed contentedly.&nbsp; It had been a tough day on the road, hawking
her wares, fighting her way through brigands, and choking on the dusty
paths, but she was in Freeport now, freshly bathed, and sipping her favorite
spiced wine at her favorite inn, the Jade Tiger's Den.&nbsp; The commons
room was nearly empty, as she had gotten in rather late (actually very
early in the morning, she mused), just the quiet murmur of two elven mages
sitting in the far corner.&nbsp; She took another sip of her wine and decided
to head up to her room as soon&nbsp; as she was finished.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
opened her eyes as she heard someone approaching the table, and looked
warily at the young man walking towards her.&nbsp; Human, about five and
a half feet tall, he struck her as quite handsome with his neatly trimmed
beard and jet black hair.&nbsp; She also noted the easy way he carried
the rapier strapped to his hip, the scabbard well worn from frequent use.&nbsp;
She took comfort in the graceful, curved Combine blade that leaned against
the wall near her left hand, and watched him approach.&nbsp;&nbsp; He flashed
a smile and spoke as he neared her, "Art thou the Ranger Sabrael, of Surefall
Glade, Bowyer Extrodanaire?"&nbsp;&nbsp; She relaxed a bit.&nbsp; "Perhaps,
young lord, I may be.&nbsp; Dost thou seek a fine bow to pair with that
handsome rapier?"&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aye, that I do," he chuckled, "but I have
not come to buy one this night.&nbsp; Instead I was wondering if you would
share with me the secrets of their making?&nbsp; I desire to craft myself
such a weapon, for I have heard that the satisfaction gained therin is
unsurpassed.&nbsp; When I inquired of the local populace, they said to
me 'Seek out the lovely Ranger Sabrael, for none knows the craft as she
does.'&nbsp; And thus I stand before you now...thou art easy to find, I
need only follow the trail of goggling eyes and broken hearts."&nbsp;&nbsp;
She smiled and motioned him to sit.&nbsp; He had a silver tongue, this
one, and she wondered if his wit was as keen.&nbsp; She liked compliments,
even when they were designed to get something from her.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bowmaking
is no easy task, young lord, nor is the telling of it. It is thirsty work,
both.&nbsp; What do you have to offer me for divulging the secrets of my
livlihood?"&nbsp; She looked meaningfully at her near empty glass.&nbsp;
The young man smiled and motioned for the barkeep to bring over a bottle
of wine and another glass.&nbsp; Sabrael sighed...it seemed she wouldn't
be going to bed anytime soon after all...</i></b>
<p><b>So you want to take up a trade skill in Everquest, and Fletching
has crossed your mind, eh?&nbsp; Why, you may ask, be a Fletcher/Bowyer?&nbsp;
Will you get rich?&nbsp; No. Will you become the world's greatest fletcher
and be the envy of all?&nbsp; No. Wll people beat down your door to buy
your bows and arrows?&nbsp; No. But...Will you make better bows than ANYTHING
that can be found in a store?&nbsp; Yes. Will you have at your disposal
some of the most powerful single-hit weapons in the game?&nbsp; Yes. Will
you find that, as one of the classes that can use a bow, your life as an
adventurer has suddenly become easier, as well as the lives of your adventuring
friends?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Will you save money?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Will you
be PROUD of the time you spend and the items you create?&nbsp; Most Definitely.</b>
<p><b>Fletching is a skill that takes a lot of time, patience, and money
to build&nbsp; up, but from what I have seen, all the trade skills are
like this.&nbsp; Right up&nbsp; front, I will offer my opinion, that, if
you are not one of the four classes&nbsp; (Ranger, Warrior, Rogue, and
Shadowknight) that can use a bow, I personally&nbsp; would not take up
fletching.&nbsp; This is because the market, due to the fact that only
those four classes can even use a bow, is rather limited.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;
the benefits of having a bow, and being able to use one, are tremendous&nbsp;
(please see my other article on Archery).&nbsp; And being able to make
your own bows and arrows is such a plus that it is hard for me to believe
that members of these classes do not ALL take up fletching...just for their
own personal&nbsp; use.&nbsp; Of course, I would rather they didn't, as
this would kill the market&nbsp; completely...ignorance is bliss (for those
of us who sell to the ignorant...).</b>
<p><b>Anyway, on to the basics of Fletching.&nbsp; As with the other trade
skills, you&nbsp; must first train at least one point in Fletching.&nbsp;
However, unlike the other skills, I would not recommend training more than
this, as your skill will&nbsp; advance quickly by making cheap arrows at
4cp per try.&nbsp; Put one to three&nbsp; points in it, save the rest of
your training for something else, and go start&nbsp; making arrows...</b>
<p><b>On the Making of Arrows&nbsp; In order to make arrows or bows, you
must have:</b>
<p><b>A supply of cash.</b>
<br><b>A fletching kit.</b>
<br><b>the correct components.</b>
<p><b>I would also recommend getting and reading the books on arrow and
bowmaking,&nbsp; as they are cheap and have good info in them.</b>
<p><b>What components do you need,&nbsp; you ask?&nbsp; Well, forget about
bows for now.&nbsp; I did not make my first simple hickory recurve bow
until skill level 30+, and even then I was failing more than succeeding.&nbsp;
For making arrows (and you will sit in a quiet corner for endless hours
making litrallay hundreds of arrows to get good at this skill) you need
4 basic components:</b>
<p><b>An arrow point.&nbsp; There are 3 different types:&nbsp; field points
(1cp each),</b>
<br><b>hooked points (a couple of silver each), and bladed (several gold
each).</b>
<br><b>An arrow shaft...again, there are several types:&nbsp; wooden (1cp
each), bone (2&nbsp; sp or so), ceramic (a couple of gold), and steel (several
gold each).</b>
<br><b>A fletch...either round cut (1 cp each), parabolic cut (6 cp each),
or shield cut (a few silver per).</b>
<br><b>And a nock...large (1cp), medium (3 cp) or small (1cp-1sp).</b>
<p><b>To start with, buy 20 each of the cheapest components...wooden shafts,
field&nbsp; points, round cut fletches, and large nocks.&nbsp; Now, find
a quiet corner, and put these items in a container like a bag or backpack.&nbsp;
Move one of each at a time into your open fletching kit, until you have
one of each in there, then&nbsp; hit combine.&nbsp; Voila!&nbsp; Most likely
you get a red message saying you failed,&nbsp; and all your components
in the kit disappear, gone forever.&nbsp; Do this 19 more times and see
how many arrows you get and how much your skill goes up. Repeat.&nbsp;
Rinse if necessary.&nbsp; Repeat again.&nbsp; Keep doing this until you
get the message that "This item is trivial for someone of your skill."&nbsp;
Usually this will happen with the 4cp arrows around skill level 16 or so.&nbsp;
This is good.&nbsp; Now, go back and buy all the same components, except
get MEDIUM nocks instead of LARGE.&nbsp; Medium nocks are harder to work
with (the more expensive a component, the harder it is to make something
with), and will raise you skill some more. Every time you get that blue
"Trivial" message, you have to start working with harder materials...and
more expensive ones.&nbsp; But remember...you only have to add one component
at a time, and you can go backwards on some of them.&nbsp; What I mean
by that is that a Parabolic Cut Fletch is more expensive than a medium
nock, so when medium nocked arrows become trivial for you, you can go back
to large nocks, but change the fletching you use.&nbsp; This will</b>
<br><b>still make for a harder arrow, and you will save yourself money
in the long run.&nbsp; Don't be afraid to experiment.&nbsp; Buy a few of
the components you think will work, try them out, and see what messages
you get.&nbsp; If they don't work, you can always sell the components back
to the merchant.&nbsp; For the cheaper components, they even give you full
value back (although they give you far less than the total value of an
item AFTER you have made it.&nbsp; I usually get 7sp back on an arrow that
cost me 1gp 2sp for basic components).</b>
<p><b>The components of the arrows and their effects are listed below.&nbsp;
This is&nbsp; much more specific than the manuals found in the game, so
it's kind of a&nbsp; spoiler.&nbsp; You have been warned.&nbsp; If you
want to skip ahead to the part on&nbsp; bows, do so now. The shaft of an
arrow determines basic damage.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wooden shaft:&nbsp; dmg 1 arrow.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bone shaft:&nbsp; dmg 2.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ceramic shaft:&nbsp; dmg 3.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steel shaft:&nbsp; ?? (dmg 4, I think.&nbsp;
Might be 5 though.)</b>
<p><b>The point adds to this damage...</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; field points:&nbsp; no addition.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hooked points:&nbsp; +1 dmg.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bladed points:&nbsp; +2 dmg.</b>
<p><b>The fletching affects the range of the arrow.&nbsp; Every arrow has
a base range of 50.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; round cut fletch:&nbsp; no change.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; parabolic cut fletch:&nbsp; +50 rng.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shield cut fletch:&nbsp; +1 damage, SUBTRACTS
range (-50, I think).</b>
<p><b>Finally, the nock adds range as well, smaller nocks being more aerodynamic.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Large nock:&nbsp; no change.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Medium nock:&nbsp; +25 rng.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small nock:&nbsp; +50 rng.</b>
<p><b>Thus, the basic 4cp arrow has a damage of 1, and a range of 50.&nbsp;
An arrow&nbsp; with a field point, bone shaft, small nock, and parabolic
fletch would be damage 2, range 150.&nbsp; Better than the flight arrows
they sell in the stores, and cheaper too!&nbsp; Just keep experimenting
with arrows until your skill gets up there.&nbsp; If you don't have customers
for arrows, and you don't want to waste the expensive ones yourself, then
you can sell them back to the merchant for about 60-75% of their value,
which will allow you to keep making more arrows...</b>
<p><b>The Art of the Bowyer.&nbsp; (you can stop scrolling down now if
you were skipping the "spoiler.")</b>
<p><b>Ok.&nbsp; You've gotten your first 30 or so skill points now, and
you are bored to tears of making arrows.&nbsp; You want a bow, to shoot
those arrows out of! Well, my friend, bows are tough to make, and expensive.&nbsp;
But they are the real reason for having this skill in the first place.&nbsp;
There are several components available for making bows.&nbsp; The most
basic requirement is a bow stave, made of some wood.&nbsp; Hickory is the
simplest and easiest to work with, and also the cheapest.&nbsp; After that
comes Elm, Ash, Oak, and Darkwood.&nbsp; A hickory bow stave is less than
3gp, and Elm is around 3pp, Ash is 18pp or so, Oak is 75 pp, and Darkwood
is over 250pp just for one bow&nbsp; stave!&nbsp; Stick with Hickory for
now.&nbsp; Second in importance is the string.&nbsp; Only 3 choices here,
and all of them&nbsp; cost less than 1gp.&nbsp; Hemp, Linen, and Silk,
with Hemp being the easiest, and silk being the most difficult.&nbsp; String
affects the damage and delay of the basic bow stave, with hemp being the
slowest but most damaging, and silk being the fastest and least hard-hitting.&nbsp;
There are other components to bows as well...planing tools and whittling
knives, and cams for making compound bows, but all of these are HORRENDOUSLY
expensive and should be avoided until much later.&nbsp; Forget about them
for now.&nbsp; Just stick with a bow stave and a string.</b>
<p><b>Buy a hickory bow stave and a length of hemp string.&nbsp; Put them
both in your&nbsp; fletching kit and hit combine.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp;
If your lucky, you'll have a new&nbsp; "rough hickory recurve bow."&nbsp;
If not, you'll be out 3gp or so and will have to try again.&nbsp; Thats
all there is to basic bow making.&nbsp; But because it is so expensive,
especially when you fail, it is NOT a good way to try to raise your skill.&nbsp;
Use arrows for that...sit in the proverbial corner making arrows until
your eyes bleed, and you have a high skill, then go try to make a couple
of bows to use and sell.</b>
<p><b>Every bow requires these two components...a stave and string.&nbsp;
What about planing tools and whittling knives and cams, you ask?&nbsp;
You want to make finished compound bows?&nbsp; Well, I can tell you what
you need to know, but my fletching skill is approaching 100, and I have
not yet made a compound bow.&nbsp; The parts are just too expensive.&nbsp;
But this is what I know:</b>
<p><b>Hickory bows can only take string.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; No tools
or anything else. Elm bows can be finished with a whittling knife.&nbsp;
You cannot use a planing tool on them.&nbsp; Ash (and any better) bows
can be finished with either a knife OR a planing&nbsp; tool, but not both.&nbsp;
I am not sure if an Ash bow can have a single cam, two cams, or no cams
at all.&nbsp; Not much point in putting 45pp cams on an 18pp bow&nbsp;
anyway. Oak bows can be cammed, but I am not sure if they can take two
cams.&nbsp; That&nbsp; would be an expensive bow to experiment with too.&nbsp;
A basic oak stave is in&nbsp; the neighborhood of 75pp, with cams running
45pp+ each, so a failure will hurt.&nbsp; Two or three people have asked
me if I make "Runed Oak Bows," so I am&nbsp; guessing that it is possible,
if one can find a set of runes.&nbsp; Again, an expensive experiment. Darkwood
bows (which cost 250pp just for a stave) can have anything you want&nbsp;
done to them. There are even rumors of Steel and Ceramic Bow staves, but
I have never</b>
<br><b>seen such offered for sale.</b>
<p><b>As far as which components do what, I have compiled a list (below,
much like the arrow components above), along with what skill level I would
recommend&nbsp; you achieve before trying.&nbsp; I will list the skills
as numbers and slashes, i.e. 30/35/46, which is the skill minimum, the
skill nominal, and the point at which the bow becomes trivial to make.</b>
<p><b>Hickory bow staves (30/35/46) are damage 10, range 50, delay 50.</b>
<br><b>Elm bow staves (50/55/66) are damage 13, range 75, delay 51.</b>
<br><b>Ash bow staves (80+, not trivial for me yet) are damage 16, range
100, delay&nbsp; 58.</b>
<br><b>Oak bow staves are estimated at damage 19-20, range 125, delay 60
or so.</b>
<br><b>Darkwood is a mystery...</b>
<p><b>Hemp twine makes the basic bows listed above.&nbsp; Slow, but damaging.</b>
<br><b>Linen string gives -1 damage, -4 delay.</b>
<br><b>Silk string gives -2 damage, -8 delay.</b>
<p><b>Whittling knives are -1 damage, -4 delay as well.</b>
<br><b>Planing tools are -2 damage, -8 delay to the finished product.</b>
<p><b>Cams increase damage (+2 presumably) to offset the string and tools.</b>
<p><b>From this, it is easy to see that using such combinations as Linen
string and&nbsp; a knife are a pointless waste of money.&nbsp; Simply using
silk string gives the same effect.&nbsp; Don't use a knife unless you are
already using silk. Likewise, don't use a planing tool with hemp twine.&nbsp;
Be smart about your money. String is dirt cheap, tools are expensive and
hard to work with.</b>
<p><b>Thus far we have discussed the making of arrows and basic bows.&nbsp;
This information will get you easily to a skill level of 100+, if you are
diligent and practice regularly.&nbsp; At skill level 101, you are considered
to have mastered a skill, so beyond that, you should have the abilities
to figure things out for yourself.&nbsp; Your apprenticeship is over.</b>
<p><b>Marketing.&nbsp; Where do you sell your bows?&nbsp; Who do you sell
them too?&nbsp; How much do you sell them for?&nbsp; Well, as mentioned
previously, only Rangers, Warriors, Rogues, and Shadowknights can use bows.&nbsp;
Before I auction my bows, I use the /who command&nbsp; to see who is in
my zone.&nbsp; If there aren't at least a few of these classes, or a lot
of anonymous people, I usually don't bother.&nbsp; I have had several people
expess interest in buying a bow "for a friend," but no one has yet done
so.&nbsp; I guess their friendship isn't worth the platinum I ask for my
bows.</b>
<p><b>NEVER sell a bow to a merchant.&nbsp; They give you far less than
you paid for the basic materials.&nbsp; All you will do is lose money.&nbsp;
Also, although I have occasionally given away a Hickory bow or two (usually
to friends, once as part of a game for some first level Rangers), I NEVER
sell my bows for a loss.&nbsp; I spent many hard hours making arrows to
get my skill where it is at, and much money as well, and bow parts are
expensive.&nbsp; That is time and money I could have spent earning experience
and better equipping myself.&nbsp; That time is woth money.&nbsp; If the
other person cannot or will not acknowledge this, then they don't deserve
to carry one of my bows.&nbsp; Simple as that.&nbsp; I also charge more
if I have to travel far, or for custom orders.&nbsp; I only know of 3 places
in the world to buy bow making supplies, and if I have to travel halfway
across the continent to hawk my wares, through dangerous terrain, then
the price goes up.&nbsp; You get what you pay for, and bows are worth the
money.&nbsp; Smart players realize this.</b>
<p><b>In general, I charge 1pp for a simple hickory bow.&nbsp; 2pp if I
have to travel a long ways.&nbsp; Elm bows cost me 3-4pp to make, so I
sell them for 6-7, sometimes more.&nbsp; Ash bows cost nearly 30pp (assuming
a 2/3rds success rate), so go for correspondingly higher prices.&nbsp;
I try to only mark my bows up 25%-50%, and I give good deals on arrows
(I was making them for my skill points anyway, so what the heck...they
are only arrows).&nbsp; I also frequently trade bows for other equipment.&nbsp;
Especially equipment that other people have made with THEIR&nbsp; trade
skills, such as armor or simple magic jewelry.</b>
<p><b>As you are walking about using the /auction command to sell your
creations, be prepared to answer A LOT of questions.&nbsp; "What are the
stats on such-and-such bow," "how much for this-and-that," "how do you
make bows," "what good are bows," and things of that nature.&nbsp; Selling
bows and adventuring are not compatible, so I do one at a time, usually
making time for both during a period of play.&nbsp; I might try to sell
bows when I first sign on, then go adventure for a while, then head back
to town to try to sell again before I sign off.&nbsp; Seems to work alright
for me.&nbsp; Also, don't be afraid to advertise custom bows and arrows,
and make them to your customers requests.&nbsp; Some people like high damage
bows, some people like fast bows, some people like some combination of
the two.&nbsp; Be flexible, and, most of all, be prepared to put a lot
of your time into the craft if you want to be good.</b>
<p><b><i>Sabrael leaned back as she finished her glass of wine.&nbsp; "There
you are my&nbsp; young friend, all that you need to know to begin a life
of hardship, boredom, and toil.&nbsp; But the rewards are great, if one
knows what to look for."&nbsp;&nbsp; It was nearly noon now, and she was
sleepy.&nbsp; The young man, Radel, finished writing on the piece of parchment
he had brought, and smiled at her.&nbsp; "My lady, it would seem I have
kept thee awake for quite some time.&nbsp; I cannot begin to express my
gratitude for what you have shared with me.&nbsp; I am in your debt."&nbsp;
She smiled back and stood up to stretch.&nbsp; "Aye.&nbsp; So it would
seem. You can begin to repay me by allowing me to excuse myself to my room.&nbsp;
It was a pleasure speaking with you, and I wish you luck in your journeys,
wherever they may take you."&nbsp; He stood and kissed her hand, and as
he walked away, she thought to herself that she had better get back to
practicing her craft soon...this young man had been quick of wit indeed,
and had asked all the right questions of her.&nbsp; If he had the patience
to match, she would have some serious competition in the future.</i></b>

<p><b>An addendum by Gunk:&nbsp; If you place your fletching kit in top
left slot and something other than a container in top right slot, you can
create arrows while shoping for parts.&nbsp; You have to watch the chat
screen to see when you create an arrow, as the graphic does not show up
in your hand,&nbsp; but can still be dropped on character pic in top right
of screen.&nbsp; Also, the first arrow made will drop to kit but can then
be moved to a bag.&nbsp; All others of the same type will go there until
you fill a 20 slot.&nbsp; This greatly speeds making arrows.</b>
