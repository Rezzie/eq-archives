<p><b>This is a thief only skill.&nbsp; You can buy a book called the tattered
book in West Karana, and possibly elsewhere, with information.&nbsp; For
each vial of poison you will need A suspension fluid, poison components
(depending upon the poison to be made), and a vial made by a potter.&nbsp;
(see the pottery recipe section for vial recipes).&nbsp; Patterns for vials
are being sold at all the merchants who formerly sold only the clay, sheets,
glass, and the book on pottery, which is actually pretty convenient, since
all other clay items require a trip to a separate sketch merchant.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Poisons are listed by type (fire, snow, etc.), and seem to have different
effects, depending on the poison type. There are three poison supply merchants.&nbsp;
One is in the shed between two farmhouses in West Karana (about -3000,
-13000), another is a dwarf on the island in the middle of Dagnor's Cauldron,
and a third is located in the Freeport tunnels. Each of these NPC's give
quests which let you get poison from them directly rather than making the
stuff.&nbsp; (see the quest sections for these two zones).&nbsp; Once you
get a vial of poison, it apparently has 10 applications if you are successfull,
and one if you aren't.</b>
<p><b>To apply the poison just click any piercing weapon onto the vial.&nbsp;
After you apply poison to your blade, it will last until you zone or attempt
to poison something.&nbsp; Poison can be resisted by the target, and if
it is, you have to reapply and try again.&nbsp; Oddly, if you move when
trying to poison, you poison attempt can be interrupted like a spell.&nbsp;
(doesn't make sense really, and i hope they change that one).&nbsp; It
seems likely that those using duel wield can apply a different poison to
each balde for two different effects (again, this is under dispute). For
poison components, you need 2 or 3 poison sacs and of course the vial.&nbsp;
The best ones, from what I have been told, are off of the cistern asps
in Oasis.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are also many new and odd components being
dropped by beasts all over Norrath. These are needed for all the new poisons,
and from what I've heard they are all very rare drops. This means that
if you get something off a monster that sounds particularly gruesome, (like
crystallized marrow off an ice bone skeleton, or bile from a fire drake),
hang on to it and try to auction it, chances are there's a rogue out there
who'd want it more than a mage wants words. There are already several appliable
poisons in the game: The Vial of spider venom&nbsp; which you get from
the bug colection quest, the vial of rabid froth and Crookstingers poison
sac.</b>
