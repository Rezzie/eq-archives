<p><b>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312863551/allakhasfantasya">The

won't be disappointed with this.</b>

Sorry Tolkein fans, but these are the best fantasy novels ever written!&nbsp;
If you have not read them, just buy them now.&nbsp; You won't regret it.&nbsp;
The characters in these books are so vivid and real, that I feel like I
know them, and the world is as complex and well thought out as any ever

have written to me to include this series.&nbsp; It is obviously very popular,
and many feel it is one of the best fantasy series ever written.&nbsp;
I have to say that the first few books in the series were incredible and
well worth reading.&nbsp; However, I think it got very mediocre after that.&nbsp;
Some of the books can really drag, and the last few just go nowhere.&nbsp;
Also, it is not yet finished, and despite there being eight books out,
the ending seems a long way away.&nbsp; I personally think Robert Jordan
decided he was just going to live off of writing these novels until he
died and started stretching it out in mid series.&nbsp; This is not a bad
fantasy series, and sometimes can be pretty great, but go into it expecting

Classic fantasy.&nbsp; The story is now somewhat commonplace, but was very
original when written.&nbsp; The writing style can best be compared to
Tolkien in how she weaves the various tales together without resorting
to sheer battle imagry.&nbsp; If you like Tolkien, you will probably like
Le Guin.&nbsp; This is a very good fantasy series.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553262505/allakhasfantasya">A

Complete Chronicles of Narnia</a> :&nbsp; I read these books when I was
a kid and loved them.&nbsp; They are known more as kids books than adult
books, and I can't think of a better way to introduce a child to the joys
of reading than giving him or her these wonderful books.&nbsp; There is
a reason these have stayed popular for more than 50 years.&nbsp; The link
above is for a hardcover version that contains all seven books for only
$35.&nbsp; You can get each individual book for about the same total through
the general link.&nbsp; Or you can splurge and get the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060244887/allakhasfantasya">deluxe

paraphernalia.&nbsp; You pasted the posters all over your walls.&nbsp;
You stood in line for hours to see the latest edition.&nbsp; Why not read
the books?&nbsp; All three movies in one book.&nbsp; This isn't great literature,
but it's kind of fun to see how the movies translate to book form.&nbsp;

read most of these, so you'll have to read the amazon.com descriptions
