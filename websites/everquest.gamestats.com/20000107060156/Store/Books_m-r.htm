<p><b>1) <font color="#CC0000">The Pliocene Exile Saga:</font>&nbsp; Is
it science fiction?&nbsp; Is it fantasy?&nbsp; Well, it's a little of both,
and is very well done at that.&nbsp; There are some times when it bogs
down a little, but this is a really interesting concept of time travel
and the mysteries of life on earth.&nbsp; Highly recommended.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345324447/allakhasfantasya">The
Many-Colored Land</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345324196/allakhasfantasya">The

<p><b>1) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345340248/allakhasfantasya">Dragonriders
of Pern</a>:&nbsp; This trilogy is considered one of the classics of science
fiction, and is clearly loved by a lot of people.&nbsp; The novels are
as much romance as science fiction, and have a more broad appeal than many
SF works.&nbsp; The story is very unique, and well told, but it may not
be for everyone.&nbsp; This version combines the original trilogy of Dragonflight,
Dragonquest, and The White Dragon into one novel.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were
quite a few sequels to the trilogy, which were set in the same world, but
explored different times and events.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I have the right
order on these:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345369335/allakhasfantasya">The
Renegades of Pern</a> ;&nbsp;</b> <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/034529873X/allakhasfantasya">Moreta

Masterharper of Pern</a></b>
<p><b>2) <font color="#CC0000">The Harper Hall Trilogy:</font>&nbsp; This
was the first sequel series after the original Dragonrider series, and
is almost as entertaining.&nbsp; If you liked that weries, you will like
this one as well.&nbsp; While it is not necessary to have read them to
enjoy these, I would recommend it.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553258524/allakhasfantasya">Dragonsong</a>

<p><b>1)&nbsp;<font color="#CC0000"> Iron Tower Trilogy:</font>&nbsp; A
very fine fantasy trilogy.&nbsp; The race of the warrows is a nice addition
to the fantasy world.&nbsp; This is a good version of the classic story
line of the little guys who get involved in a war against evil and become
heros.&nbsp; It's a shame that the duology which follows these novels is
now out of print.&nbsp; You can't go wrong with these.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451451023/allakhasfantasya">The

<p><b>2)&nbsp; <font color="#CC0000">Other Mithgar Novels:</font>&nbsp;
These are all stand alone novels that take place in Mithgar, the world
where the Iron Tower Trilogy is set.&nbsp; They take place at different
times and have different characters, so they are not a series, but simply
related novels.&nbsp; Each one is well worth reading.&nbsp; The world he
has created is very real and fascinating, and his characters are always
interesting.&nbsp; Read the descriptions of the novels, and pick the one
you find most interesting.&nbsp; Once you start, you will probably want
to read the whole set.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451454111/allakhasfantasya">Voyage
of the Fox Rider</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451452682/allakhasfantasya">The

of Socrates</a> :&nbsp; A must read for fantasy role players.&nbsp; Engrossing
story of a group of role players who step up into the next step of computer
gaming.&nbsp; It starts off a little slow, but hooks you part way in and
leaves you waiting for the sequel, which from the ending, may or may not
happen.</b>
<p><b>4)&nbsp;<img SRC="iconnew.gif" height=12 width=31><font color="#CC0000">The

<p>1) <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441005969/allakhasfantasya">Riddle-Master
: The Complete Trilogy</a> :&nbsp; A re-release of the whole trilogy in
one book, including the novels The Riddle-Master of Hed, Heir of Sea and
Fire, and Harpist in the Wind.&nbsp; These are based upon Celtic mythology
and are a different type of fantasy than the standard novels written today.&nbsp;
Kind of a mystic tale, and worth reading.</b>

<p><b>1) <font color="#CC0000">The Recluce Saga:</font>&nbsp; I really
like the world the author has created and enjoy reading his books.&nbsp;
My biggest complaint is that he skips around from book to book, with characters
introduced in one book not reappearing until several books later, so that
plot lines hinted at in each book can wait a long time to get resolved,
if ever.&nbsp; This wouldn't be so bad if the books weren't so good.&nbsp;
Even though they are listed in a certain order, there is no real order
to this saga, since the books cover different characters and even different
time periods.&nbsp; Still, some later ones refer back to older books, so
it is best to read them in order.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812505182/allakhasfantasya">The

<p><b>1) <font color="#CC0000">The Elrick Saga:</font>&nbsp; Except perhaps
for the Thomas Covenant series, you will not find a more unlikable hero
than Elrick.&nbsp; This is part of the charm of these books.&nbsp; Very
original brooding dark fantasy.&nbsp; One of the classic fantasy series
that spawned the genre.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441203981/allakhasfantasya">Elric

<p><b>One of the classic Science Fiction writers, with a large library

and find Dream Park, which describes the ultimate RPG.</b>
<p><b>1)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0449208133/allakhasfantasya">Lucifer's
Hammer</a> :&nbsp; Several movies have come out over the past few years
about a comet crashing into the earth, and I always felt they were ripping
off this book without giving it its due credit.&nbsp; A very believable
rendition of the doomsday scenario.</b>
<p><b>2)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671741926/allakhasfantasya">The
Mote in God's Eye</a> :&nbsp; (Written with Jerry Pournelle) Excellent
novel about first contact with aliens.&nbsp; The alien culture is very
well thought out and detailed, and the problems encountered are fascinating.</b>
<p><b>3) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345333926/allakhasfantasya">Ringworld</a>
:&nbsp; A science fiction classic.&nbsp; A completely unique idea for a
world that is amazing in its conception.&nbsp; The book is not perfect,
but is well worth reading.&nbsp; There were two sequels which, while not
as good as the original, were still very entertaining, especially the first
one.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345334302/">Ringworld

<p><b>His novels of the Inner Frontier are some of the most unique and
fun science fiction novels ever written.&nbsp; Santiago ranks as one of
my favorite books ever.&nbsp; He has basically transferred the western
to outer space and has created characters that are just amazing. Once you
start reading them, you will just tear through then and wish he would go
out and write more.&nbsp; There are other ones besides these, but unfortunately,
they are out of print.</b>

: A Myth of the Far Future</a> All of his books are worth reading, but
you should definitely get Santiago.&nbsp; The book lures you in and overwhelms
you with the fantastic characters who make up the myths of this far future.&nbsp;
You will tear through this book and wish it was 200 pages longer.&nbsp;
I must have read this book 5 times, and enjoyed it just as much each time.</b>
