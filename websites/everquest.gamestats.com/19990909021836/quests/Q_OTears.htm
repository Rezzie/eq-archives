<p><a NAME="Bracers of Erollisi"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bracers of
Erollisi:</font>&nbsp; Styria Fearnon will tell you that the pirate captain
has stolen the Bracers of Erollisi.&nbsp; Return them for a faction, experience
some gold and a minor item.&nbsp; The factions which change are as follows:&nbsp;
Faydark's Champions, King Tearisthex, Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of
Tunare get better and Crushbone Orcs gets worse.&nbsp; Basically the bracers
are worth more than the reward.&nbsp; (Submitted by Doriath)</b>
<p><a NAME="Hehe Meat"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">HEHE meat:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest to get the <a href="../equipment/graphics/Grobb_Cleaver.htm">Grobb
Cleaver</a>.&nbsp; It starts in Grobb (of course).&nbsp; Talk to Carver,
by the Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat
called "HEHE meat" and the recipe to make it.&nbsp; You can purchase the
meat in Oggok from Dooga the Ogre Chef.&nbsp; (He has a seperate quest
to deliver froglock legs).&nbsp;&nbsp; He will send you to deliver a Grub
Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik.&nbsp;
Nerbilik is fishing on the Siren rocks.&nbsp; Be careful, since I have
been told the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent.&nbsp;
Give him the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased
faction with DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and
some xp.&nbsp; However, he will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so
you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse.&nbsp; Then take the recipe
and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for
you efforts.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ashrum)</b>
<p><a NAME="Knight Card"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Knight
Cards:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; After you kill&nbsp; the gnomish clockwork "Cleaner
VII" which wanders Northern Kaladim and return his remains to Beno Tenarle,
he will give you a knight card&nbsp; which he would like you to return
to the smith, Doran Vargnus.&nbsp; Doran Vargnus is one of the dwarven
smiths shipwrecked on the Island of Erollisi.&nbsp; The island is located
in the Ocean of Tears between Kaladim and Freeport.&nbsp; The dwarves are
camped in a small tent on the southeast corner of the island. (LOC: 1280
-9245)&nbsp; Complete the quest by giving the knight card to Doran.&nbsp;
He gives you an item for the card which ranges from cloth to some pretty
nice armor pieces such as blackened and bronze, and even dwarven mail.&nbsp;
Also, Doran is not picky about where you get the Knight card.&nbsp; You
can get knight cards (among others) by playing poker with either Moodoro
Finharn in the fish's ale (See the <a href="Q_Qeynos.htm#Library Book (E)">Library
Book</a> quest in Qeynos) or with Zenita DRin in Freeport (See the <a href="Q_Steam.htm#Telescope Lenses (A)">Telescope
Lens</a> quest in Steamfont) and he will give you items for these cards
as well.&nbsp; (Submitted by Rexan)</b>
<p><a NAME="The Mudtoes (Eo)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Mudtoes:&nbsp;</font>
Furtog Ogrebane in Kaladim will tell you that his father killed a whole
tribe of ogres (the Mudtoes) except for two that got away.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then he tells you to go to the docks in BB and find more info on it. You
have to go to the Butcherblock port and talk to the girl on the end and
she'll tell you to find the two remaining Mudtoes, Boog and Goob, in the
Sea of Tears. You will find one named Boog Mudtoe (lev 17) on the island
right across from the all girl island of Erollisi. You kill him and get
his head and a note that is to his brother.&nbsp; His brother is on the
island with Gornit the Giant.&nbsp; He is a shaman and casts root a lot,
so you have to be careful attacking him.&nbsp; Take their heads back to
Furtog for a decent item and the Trumpy Irontoe quest.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Doomfist)</b>
<p><a NAME="Pirate Earrings"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Pirate Earrings:</font>&nbsp;
Styria Fearnon on Eriollisi will give a quest to return pirate earrings
to her for a minor item, a few coins, and faction adjustments.&nbsp; The
pirates are on another island.&nbsp; When you submit the earrings, you
get the following faction adjustments:&nbsp;&nbsp; faydarks champions,
King teristhes, clerics of tunare, and soldiers of tunare go up and crushbone
orcs go down.&nbsp; (Submitted by Erondil)</b>
<p><a NAME="Sentry Xyrinn (OT)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Sentry Xyrinn:</font>&nbsp;
Somewhere in the Ocean of Tears there is an undead island (rough loc of
-604.96, -7343.81).&nbsp; The island is populated by a few greater skeletons,
a couple gargoyles, and four specters.&nbsp; There you will find stranded
a female paladin named Sentry Xyrin.&nbsp; She mentions that she was part
of a [boat disaster] and that she is from the temple of Marr in Freeport.&nbsp;
She will ask you to get her a [Potion of Marr] from Serna Tasknon is the
Temple of Marr in Freeport.&nbsp; With the potion she will be able to regain
her strength and take on the undead.&nbsp; (You can also initiate this
quest by first speaking to someone in the Temple of Marr, getting the potion,
and from that point on learning of Sentry Xyrinn's location and going to
look for her).&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to get the bottle from the Temple of
Marr and then bring the bottle to all the 8 guards in alphabetical order
(It does not tell you all the names so you must figure this out yourself).&nbsp;
It seems that if your faction is not high enough you can't get the bottle.&nbsp;
When you give it to the last person (not including Xyrinn) he will tell
you that she went to the Sisterhood of Erolisi.&nbsp; The sisters will
tell you she is either dead or stranded on a nearby island.&nbsp; Then
go to the island where she is stranded and give the bottle to her.&nbsp;
She will give it back to you to take back to the temple, after which you
will be done.&nbsp; (Submitted by the Monk Kausee and by IceAssasin)</b>
<p><a NAME="Tome of Ages"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Tome of Ages:</font>&nbsp;
This looks like another long and involved quest, which may not yet be active.&nbsp;
It starts on the Island of the Isle Goblins across from the Isle of the
Sisterhood of Erollisi.&nbsp; Talk to the Oracle of K'Arnon.&nbsp; He asks
if you seek knowledge or offer something.&nbsp; Either way, you get to
what he seeks: The Tome of Ages written by the Scribes of Dal.&nbsp; This
is a group of dark elves who broke the tomb into seven separate pieces,
perhaps to keep it from the oracle.&nbsp; Asking about the Scribes, he
says that if he knew where they were, he would not be asking you to find
them.&nbsp; It seems that you need to find the pieces and combine them
to re-form the Tome of Ages.&nbsp; I only know of one book which you can
definitely obtain:&nbsp; The <a href="Q_Neriak.htm#Book of Turmoil">Book
of Turmoil</a> in Neriak, which, when given back to the Oracle of K'Arnon,
yields a Glowing Torch (a nice item for enchanters), a bit of exp and the
following factions adjustments:&nbsp; Oracle of K'Arnon goes up, Oracle
of Marud goes down.&nbsp; (I wonder where that Oracle is?).&nbsp; The other
six books are most likely Book of Enlightenment, The Lost Book, Book of
Blood, Book of Monuments, Book of Elders and Book of Scale.&nbsp; However,
the message given for using the Keywords of the other 6 books are all basically
the same. "I do not seek the &lt;bookname> at this time, but I may have
need of it in the future".&nbsp; Thus, it is likely that you either have
to be a very high level to complete the quest or it is not yet complete.
