<p><a NAME="Ged's Gloves"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Ged's Gloves:</font>&nbsp;
There is an NPC named Ged Twigborn who hangs around another NPC and they
will wander the forest at times. I usually see them in one of two places:
either along the same wall as the zone to the commonlands, or by turning
on the path off the main road from the sign pointing towards Freeport.
Ged will make you some gloves for a price. He makes ratskin, wolfskin,
bearhide, or lionskin gloves. All require some money and a specific pelt.&nbsp;
You need to be amiable with him to buy lionskin gloves.&nbsp; The <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Ratskin_Gloves.htm">Ratskin
Gloves</a></font> cost 6 gold and a giant rat pelt (ac 3 , negative 5 charisma),&nbsp;
the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Bearskin_Gloves.htm">Bearskin
Gloves</a></font> cost 25 gold and a high quality bear skin (ac 5), the
wolfskin gloves cost 13 gold and a high quality wolf pelt and the lionskin
gloves (ac 5) cost 95 gold and a high quality lion skin. I have been told
that a tiger spawns some times in the south west corner of Kith forest
near the orc spawn and gives a high quality skin, and that they are also
dropped by highland Lions in NK.&nbsp; The gloves are good for druids who
can't wear metal.</b>

Etched Armor:</font>&nbsp; [NOTE - This quest is still only on the test
server, but should go live on 10/13/99]&nbsp; In the ranger camp in Kithicor,
you can obtain several pieces of Ranger only armor:&nbsp; (Submitted by
Tsunamineko)</b>

<b><font color="#990000">Ivy Etched Helm:</font>&nbsp; 1) Top of the rune

Greenburn (a wayward&nbsp; master archer) in Raithe by unkempt druids and

<p><br><a NAME="Morin's Sword"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Morin's
Sword:</font>&nbsp; Morin Shadowbane, the multisexual ranger guildmaster
of the forest, sends you on a Quest for the new Ranger only weapon, the
Short Sword of Morin.&nbsp; If you trade in an Ebony Bladed Sword to Morin
(Some people have said that Mornin must be in female form for the trade),
you will get a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics6/Short_Sword_of_Morin.htm">Short
Sword of Morin</a></font> , a Ranger only weapon.&nbsp; She will also tell
you that she will give you her personal sword if you find and kill the
Ghoul Messenger, who is located "between Kithicor and the Karanas" and
bring back his note, or whatever he drops.&nbsp; I have received conflicting
reports/speculation as to whether this will result in a different sword
or the same one as you get for turning in the Ebony Blade.&nbsp; Since
the ghoul messenger does not seem to be in the game yet, this will have
to wait to be resolved.&nbsp; (Submitted by Anaxagoras Ionia)</b>
