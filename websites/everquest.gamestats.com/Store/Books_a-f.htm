<p><b>1)&nbsp;<font color="#CC0000"> Hitchhiker's Series:</font>&nbsp;
Very enjoyable, light reading that is technically science fiction, but
is almost it's own genre.&nbsp; This series is just plain funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you like novels that provide a lot of wry humor and don't take themselves
too seriously, these are for you.&nbsp; The "trilogy" runs to five books
now.&nbsp; The first three are better than the last two, but all are worth
reading.&nbsp; In order, the books are:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345391802/allakhasfantasya">The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a> ;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345391810/allakhasfantasya">The

this book, which combines all five books plus a bonus story in one hardback

Adept Series:</font>&nbsp; There are seven books in this series, but the
last four seem to have been written to exploit the popularity of the original
trilogy.&nbsp; I would only recommend the first three, which are all excellent.&nbsp;
This is a cool concept of two alternate universes, one with a SF theme
and one with a fantasy one, which start to juxtapose.&nbsp; Both universes
are well thought out and fun to read about, and these novels are real page
turners.&nbsp; The trilogy is:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345354915/allakhasfantasya">Split

<p><b>2)<font color="#CC0000"> The Magic of Xanth:</font>&nbsp; This series
is hard to review.&nbsp; There are some truly aweful books in this series,
but there are also some really great ones.&nbsp; For the most part, the
novels in this series are funny, light and entertaining.&nbsp; The first
several books are the best ones.&nbsp; After that, they start to vary significantly
in quality.&nbsp; You won't do bad with any of the followups. Just remember
that the name Xanth doesn't guarantee a great book.&nbsp; The initial books
are (I'm not sure of the exact order, but I think this is right): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345347536/allakhasfantasya">A

<p><b>3) <font color="#CC0000">Incarnations of Immortality:</font>&nbsp;
The first book in this series is seriously cool:&nbsp; the story about
how a man accidentally becomes the grim reaper.&nbsp; The rest of the books
never quite live up to the first, but as a whole, it is still a fun series
to read.&nbsp; I like the concept.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345338588/allakhasfantasya">On

Asimov resisted revisiting his masterpiece until much later, when he must

with the follow-up novels, but the original trilogy was too good to really
match, so they were basically disappointing.&nbsp; If for some odd reason
you haven't read these classics, buy them now.&nbsp; They really live up
