the several of these&nbsp; books are listed as out of stock.&nbsp; I don't

Unfortunately the book "Empire of the East", which is a great book and
sets up the premise for this series, is out of print.&nbsp; You don't need
to have read that for this series, but it would let you appreciate some

interesting is that clerical magic is not really represented in fantasy
too much, so this comes from a somewhat different perspective.&nbsp; If

Written a long time ago, well before I was born, these books inspired a
whole generation of science fiction writers.&nbsp; 50 years or so later,
they are still as good as when they were first written.&nbsp; The books
seem to only be available as trade paperbacks, so they are a little more
expensive than most. One warning.&nbsp; The first book in the series is
basically to provide background for the rest, and is thus pretty tedious
at times.&nbsp; Don't let it discourage you from getting the rest, which
are rocking space opera at its finest.&nbsp; You can even skip the first
book without mising a whole lot if you want.
