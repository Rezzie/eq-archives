<p><b><font size=+1>First Things First...</font></b>
<br>Playing a Dark Elf Magician is totally different than playing something
like a High Elf Magician, naturally due to faction hits and who you can
and can not attack. Thus, I write this with dark elves in specific. I myself
love playing dark elves, but often I get frustrated by the fact that I
have to cast Invisibility almost each and every time I want to go into
a town that's not Neriak/Grobb/Oggok, but do not let this discourage you
from playing a race/class that kicks oh so much arse. Then again... every
race/class kicks ass, but you have to know how to play them to get the
most out of it... Please note I will not go into full detail on Neriak.
There are many maps on the internet to view &lt;cougheverquest.gamestats.comcough>
and this guide will assume you took a look at a few of them.
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 1: Character Creation</font></b>
<br>Choosing a Dark Elf Magician gives you many sweet advantages with few
disadvantages. Dark elves have a naturally high Intelligence which is something
you need a lot of. Think about it for a second, do you want a 130+ INT
Magician with mana coming out of the rear, or do you want a Magician that's
well rounded in DEX/AGI/STA/INT/WIS? Everything's up to you. Personally,
I would choose a good sized STA to counteract the low hit points Mages
get, with a good helping of INT (for mana), and some AGI/DEX to increase
that Armor Class rating up a bit. Later in your life you will find magical
items and jewelry to increase your INT (and thus you mana stores as well),
so dont worry about an ungodly high INT right now. Besides, your mana isnt
going to look very good the first few levels anyway, so dont even bother
worrying about it.
<br>Now the next step is extremely important in the long run: your deity.
Are you Agnostic or are you a follower of Innoruuk? Following the Prince
of Hate can lead to you being welcomed warmly into almost anywhere in Neriak,
but beware, for you will almost certainly get Killed On Sight in other
towns. Agnostic is most likely the better way to go. You wont be very welcome
with most NPC's in Neriak (namely the Necromancer guild), but you have
a better chance at surviving in other towns, albeit a small one. I chose
Agnostic for this reason, and this guide will assume you will too.
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 2: Levels 1-3</font></b>
<br>Ok, like many would say, the first 3 levels are pretty much the same
for all classes. Lets take a look at your starting life, shall we?
<br>You will start in the Neriak Commons zone, in front of the Dashing
Form clothes shop. In your hands you'll find a club, 5 food, 5 water, 2
spell scrolls, a guild note, and the PK book. If PvP is not your cup of
tea, destroy it and free up the valuable space. Start out by hitting the
Spells button and scribe/memorize those two spells. The first is Minor
Shielding and the second is Burst of Flame, both you will use quite often
in your new life, so get to know them. Once you do get them memorized,
go through the archway near you and go up the crude ramp on the right into
the gate-like door. Welcome to the Magic Guild! If the spam of NPC spellcasters
doesnt drive you insane, the noise of their spellcasting will. When you
enter, there will be on the far side of the room two stairs. The one on
the right goes up to more guild NPCs (and more Enchanter spell merchants),
and the one on the left will go downstairs to the spellshops and guildleaders.
Go downstairs and go all the way down the hall to the door at the end.
Inside are the three guildleaders and a few spell merchants. Your note
should tell you which NPC you should give the note to (the one directly
opposite of the door). Once you do give the note, you'll recieve the guild
tunic and will also take a faction hit with The Dead (Necromancers) and
gain in The Spurned (any other Magic Users). Put on the tunic and wield
the club. Take some time out to explore Neriak if you arent familar and
find your way out to Foreign Quarter and then to Nektulos Forest (if you
dont know the way, have someone lead you. Neriak is confusing to many new
players). Now it's time to go hunting!
<br>Although a paradise for Necromancers to stockpile their bone chips,
Nektulos Forest just plain sucks for a newbie of any class. The Player
to Monster ratio is horrible. Instead, follow the nearby road past the
bridge into East Commonlands and take the fork from there to the left and
head on to West Freeport. The monsters here spawn in a confined area and
thus they are MUCH easier to find. Be careful of the Freeport Guards! Do
not get too close to the Freeport gates, lest you might anger one of the
militia. If they /con dubiously, they are ok to get close to, but dont
get close if they /con threatenly or scowls at you. Trust me, you'll thank
me later when you are using the time it takes your newly killed self to
run all the way back from Nektulos to hunt and gain levels.
<br>Start on rats and snakes, or if it's nighttime, go for bats. Get some
good distance between the target and you, and fire away with your Burst
of Flame spell. Back up while your spell is recharging since you may get
another shot in before you go melee. Dont forget to hit your auto-attack!!
I've seen too many newbies die because they forgot the most important part
of combat.
<br>The loot here is only so-so at level 1, but the advantage is that the
majority of the loot you get from bats/rats/snakes is that they are stackable.
Destroy the non-stackable rat teeth, snake fangs, and snake eggs. The money
you make off of these is NOT worth the effort. Keep using your Burst spell
until you hear that lovely sound every player charishes: DING! Welcome
to level 2. Keep hunting the rats/snakes/bats, but dont take on the Deathfist
Pawns until next level. The advantage of this level is that you are quite
suffecient to take on Decaying Skeletons, and extremely lucky if you can
kill that certain skeleton who's holding the cracked staff (sell for around
1 platinum piece!).
<br>If you make a good amount of loot, head back to Neriak and buy yourself
a spell or two with the money you made. My personal suggestion: Summon
Water, Summon Food, or Summon Dagger. Water/Food is quite possibly the
best spells in the game, but Dagger will allow you to get yourself a magical
weapon that's better than that crappy club you're still carrying around.
Any chance you get, buy yourself a large bag or backpack. In fact, buy
a lot of them. They will allow you to carry around a lot more loot so you
can hunt a wider range of monsters.
<br>If you started to use Piercing, save up about 5 gold and go ahead and
ask a high level player in East Commonlands if he/she would get you a Giant
Snake Fang. These killing machines can dish out a sweet 5 dmg rating with
very little delay. Perfect for magic users who specialize in Piercing weapons.
Otherwise, find a cracked staff (OneHanded Blunt) or a Worn Great Staff
(TwoHanded Blunt) for your killing needs.
<br>At level 3, go ahead and kill the Deathfist orcs. Killing the pawns
here has two advantages: Armor and Weapons. Sell the weapons and wear the
armor. The cloth armor they give will be what you will wear until you finally
upgrade to something like woven much later in your life.
<br>Like many guides, I'll give you a run down of the most notable spells
you'll find and I will rate them on effiency. I'll rate spells on Minuses
or Pluses. Four pluses means the best spell you can get at your level,
Four minuses means a total piece of garbage not worthy of your spellbook.
<p><b>Burst of Flame: </b>Your first and most basic burn spell. Costs 7
mana and only does a maximum of about 6 damage. Very useful in your early
levels, but increasingly worthless later on. Later in your life, you'll
be using this spell to get the attention of monsters, but it's not a very
effective attention getter once you get a pet. <b>Rating: +</b>
<p><b>Minor Shielding: </b>Your first shield spell. Costs 10 mana and adds
to your hit points and AC. One thing I love about this spell is that it's
very mana efficient for a long lasting shield spell. You'll be using this
spell even after you get your next upgrade. Rating: ++
<p><b>Summon Dagger:</b> If you use Piercing weapons or plan to hunt willowisps
in the future, this is the spell for you. Summons a magical dagger that
will dissappear when you log out. Costs 10 mana only. <b>Rating: +</b>
<p><b>Summon Food/Summon Water: </b>10 mana to summon one black bread or
flask of water that will dissappear on logout. This, along with Summon
Water is one of the most used Magician spells in the game! Only problem
with Summon Water is that they cant be used in things like Pottery or Blacksmithing.
<b>Rating:
++++</b>
<p><b>Reclaim Energy: </b>Although costing only 5 mana, this spell is still
a piece of garbage. It just doesnt live up to it's spell description hype.
It'll destroy your own pet and give back some mana, but the problem is
that the mana you recieve is almost nil. Only good thing about this spell
is that it helps you kill your own pet if it's weak to make room for a
stronger one, but dont waste your time memorizing this spell for anything
else. <b>Rating: --</b>-
<p><b>Sense Magic: </b>Completely worthless except for one reason only:
To gain skill in Divination. Detects magic in whatever your are holding
in your mouse cursor, but can be counteracted by the fact that you can
right click and hold on an item to see it's entire properties. Certainly
one spell Verant needs to upgrade. <b>Rating: ----</b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 3: Levels 4-7</font></b>
<br>At this point in your life, you'll now understand the power and beauty
of a magican: the elementals. If you've save up over 5 gold, you can go
buy yourself a Summon Elementalkin spell. You have your choice of Water,
Air, Fire, and Earth. Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Water
for the well-balanced and high hit point regen, Air for invisibility and
high Armor Class, Fire for pure damage but low hit points, and Earth for
massive hit points but low Armor Class. Elementalkins are expencive even
after you buy the spell, for they require one malachite per casting! You
can buy that downstairs in the magic guild, or in the gem shop in 3rd Quarter
(which you'll frequent much later in your life). Be sure to buy at least
10 or more malachite, there is nothing more frustrating than getting beefed
up for a battle, travelling several zones, finally start casting your spells,
and then suddenly forgetting that you have no malachite to summon your
pet. Without an elemental, the magician is nothing more than a weak wizard
with a few special spells.
<br>You'll finally gain the ever important skill all magic users charish:
Meditate. Spend ONLY 1 training point into buying Meditate because it'll
go up extremely quick on it's own. Remember the little meditate button
on the spell menu? Click it and you'll notice that over time your mana
will be recharging at a much higher rate. You'll also notice that your
spell memorization will be much quicker, and will be extremely important
if you die and have to rememorize the spells again.
<br>>From here, hunt in Nektulos Forest on the right side of the road (coming
from Neriak) where the large spiders and normal skeletons hang out. The
large spiders give the best loot: spider silk which can be sold for over
1 gold each. Watch out for the skeletons and bears though, and stay away
from Young Kodiaks!!
<br>Use the commands of /pet attack, /pet guard me, and /pet back off to
your advantage. In fact, assign them to social keys and then reassign them
to your hot keys. Be sure to use the /pet back off command only when grouping
and only when the monster is almost dead, due to the fact that pets will
steal some exp if they get the final blow in (however they will ALWAYS
steal exp when you are soloing, so dont hold back).
<br>At around 7th level, you'll find your pet is increasingly worthless
against most monsters you hunt, and thus you'll need to start tanking for
it. At around this time is a great time to join a group that's camping
around the skeleton ruins or obelisk. Not only will you gain a decent amount
of exp with low risk, you may even gain yourself a few new friends. Keep
doing this until about 9th level.
<br>Also, an extremely useful spell to buy at this point is your burn spell
upgrade and Summon Bandages. Bandages will allow you to make use of the
extremely helpful skill of Bind Wounds. Later in your life, when you can
Bind for 30+ hit points, it's a life saver when you are low on life and
the party cleric is out of mana.
<p><b>Burn: </b>Your second in the line of burn spells. Costs only 15 mana
and does about a maximum of 12 damage. Would be great if the damage was
upped a bit. <b>Rating: ++</b>
<p><b>Summon Elementalkin Water/Earth/Air/Fire:</b> Costs 40 mana for your
first pet spells. Choose one and stick with it, since it'll be kinda worthless
to buy all four spells unless you want bragging rights. Use these to tank
for you, but at this stage the elementals are kinda weak. <b>Rating: ++++</b>
<p><b>Gate: </b>Costs a massive 70 mana, but this is one of the most efficient
spells in the game. It will teleport you back to your home point or your
set point (if you used, or got someone to use, Bind Affinity). Very cool
spell for emergency escape routes, as you'll be using this spell all your
life. <b>Rating: ++++</b>
<p><b>Summon Bandages:</b> If you're going to go hunting solo, the 15 mana
is well worth it to summon some bandages for yourself to practice Bind
Wounds on. Bind Wounds will mean the difference between life and death
when you're poisoned and cant get to a cleric in time.<b> Rating: +++</b>
<p><b>Sense Summoned:</b> If you're going to go hunting Fire Elementals
in Lavastorm and there are no other Magicians in the area, including you're
own pet, this spell might be useful. Unfortunately, it bites otherwise.
<b>Rating:
-</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 4: Levels 8-11</font></b>
<br>Once you hit level 8, buy the next Summon Elemental spell, but also
buy Shock of Blades. Blades will be the one burn spell you'll use until
level 16, naturally due to the fact that level 12 never gives you a direct
damage spell, and the damage spells the level does give have an ungodly
high Mana to Damage ratio making them almost worthless. From here on, hunt
in East Commonlands taking on the Darkweed Snakes (watch out for their
poison!) and various other ilk. Hunt Young Kodiaks only if you are confident
in your skills.
<p><b>Summon Elementaling Water/Earth/Air/Fire: </b>Next in line for the
pet upgrade, these guys hit harder, have more hit points, and just are
just plain better than Elementalkins. You'll start to notice that the Double
Attack elementals have will be increasingly better, not to mention as elementals
go up in upgrades, you'll get things like parry/dodge/reposite/etc.. Costs
80 mana, so be sure to cast it in a safe area because you will be meditating
that back up again. <b>Rating: ++++</b>
<p><b>Shock of Blades: </b>The next upgrade in your Direct Damage arsenal,
Blades is one of the most loved Magician DD spells, naturally due to the
fact that it uses Conjuration skill and not Evocation. 30 mana for a good
23+ damage, plus it only gets more powerful as you gain in levels, but
ditch the spell for Shock of Flame at level 16.<b> Rating: ++++</b>
<p><b>Flame Bolt: </b>I really cant recommend this DD Bolt spell. It's
good, but you actually have to AIM the stupid thing and sometimes it can
hit a tree or something. Looks cool however. <b>Rating: ++</b>
<p><b>Invisibility: </b>For 30 mana, this is the single most dangerous
spell in your entire arsenal. Not dangerous to others, but rather to yourself.
Complete invisibility (except to undead and special creatures), but it's
spell duration is totally random and it gives you no warning whatsoever
when it will wear off. Although extremely useful, you will be sure it can
make your heart race faster while running thru Freeport or other towns
praying the spell holds long enough. <b>Rating: ++</b>
<p><b>Lesser Shielding: </b>An upgrade to Minor Shielding, Lesser not only
gives the benefits of Minor, but it also gives you some Magic Resistance.
Not really mana efficient unless you are going into PvP combat with other
magic users.<b> Rating: +</b>
<p>Shield of Fire: Your first fire shield, Shield of Fire will put up a
temporary shield that will damage whatever gets a successful melee hit
off of you. Does nothing to your Armor however. Great spell to buff your
pet with before battle. <b>Rating: ++</b>
<p>Well by this time, you should know exactly what to do and where to hunt
and how to survive. No longer are you a newbie. Hope you do better than
what I had to go through in my early days. Ick.
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 5: Using your Elemental</font></b>
<br>So you've summoned your first elemental and now ready to rock? I dont
think so. While elementals obey your every command, they are fickle sometimes.
Below are some commands you should learn to use effectively, unless of
course you want to take one good look at a train of monsters that just
killed your pet and is now homing in on you. Be warned that all commands
cannot be given unless the pet is within a certain distance from you. This
is why you should stay near your pet the majority of the time. For very
easy access, assign all the commands to social keys, and assign the ones
you'll be using most to the hot keys
<p><b>/pet attack</b>
<br>This command is quite obvious. Target something, give the command,
and the elemental will carry out your order to destroy whatever it is.
The elemental has many forms of attack, ranging from the normal hits, to
bashing, to their own magical spell attack. Whatever you do, do not listen
to what others will tell you about letting the pet attack on it's own.
It's just like a normal player and can get killed easily. NEVER let it
attack something without supporting it via Direct Damage spells, otherwise
you will find your pet, and yourself, getting killed quite often. This
brings me to another question: To tank, or not to tank? When you first
get your elementals, you'll naturally be using them as the tanks (letting
the creature beat up on it while you blast it from afar). However, if it
gets poisoned, the elemental will lose it's innate ability to regenerate
quickly and that is when you should jump into the melee and tank for it.
Dont worry about it's hit points, as long as it's not taking any damage
it'll still regenerate hit points naturally (for the weaker poisons), albiet
slowly. You should also monitor it's own hit points and jump in to tank
for it when it gets low, which brings me to:
<p><b>/pet report health</b>
<br>This command will tell the elemental to report to you how many hit
points it has left. It is much more useful than targetting the pet itself
since it will report the exact percentage it's at instead of waiting for
that little red bar to go down to it's level. It's also effective because
you dont need to target the pet to find out it's hit points, thus you can
still keep a lock on a monster while monitoring your own pet.
<p><b>/pet back off</b>
<br>This command is extremely useful in group combat because it will tell
the pet to stop attacking, thus preventing it from gaining the final kill
and stealing precious exp. Kinda worthless when you solo since it takes
exp no matter what, so dont hold back unless the elemental is poisoned
or dangerously wounded. Please note that if the monster continues to attack
the pet even after you gave the command, there's really not much you can
do to stop the pet from attacking again!
<p><b>/pet guard me</b>
<br>Kinda worthless since the pet will almost always be guarding you from
attack.
<p><b>/pet guard here</b>
<br>Extremely useful when camping a spot in groups, this command tells
the pet to stop following you and hold it's position in a certain spot,
althewhile still guarding you. To make maximum use for this, command the
pet to guard here near your group, run off looking for monsters to lure,
and lure it into the trap that you set with your pet and group. It's also
useful if you want to lure and dont want your pet following you around
messing up a valuable pull.
<p><b>/pet who the leader</b>
<br>Very useless since all it will do is make the pet say "My leader is
soandso" where Soandso is your name. Neat to do in conversations.
<p><b>/pet follow me</b>
<br>Use this if you want your pet to follow you again if you used a command
that will make the pet stop (IE: /pet guard here).
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 6: Advanced Magician Techniques</font></b>
<br>Ok, by now you have learned how to hunt and the more useful commands
your elemental will respond, but you dont know how a magician <i>really</i>
works. Below are a few tips to maximize your efficiency as a summoner:
<p><b>Circle Strafe</b>
<br>Most often, monsters will try to nudge past your pet and will try to
go melee on you. On easy monsters this is no problem whatsoever, however
if you are hunting things like Sisters of Erollisi, you are going to find
yourself getting hit in melee by a big bad halberd for 25+ damage per hit.
You can prevent this damage by circle strafing (you Quakers know what I'm
talking about) around your pet. Simply hold down the right mouse button
and then hold down the right or left arrow key on your keyboard. You'll
sidestep, but keep the elemental in view by making a complete circle strafe
using the mouse. Monsters really, really hate this since they have to chase
you down &lt;grin>. Back up a few steps to cast a burn spell or whatever,
then resume the stafing. DO NOT try this in the Lavastorm Mountains! You
may find yourself strafing into a pool of lava.
<p><b>Use Fire Shields!</b>
<br>If you are going to hunt some serious stuff (things that con white
or yellow), cast a Shield of Fire/Flame/etc on your pet before hand. Please
note a Fire Elemental already has this perminently on, so dont bother.
Each time the pet gets hit, the creature that attacked will take some damage.
Sure it's not much damage and the shield doesnt last long, but we're talking
about a per-hit basis here. It all adds up, mind you. Your first fire shield
spell comes at level 8 (Shield of Fire).
<p><b>To Burnout or not To Burnout?</b>
<br>That is the question which I ask you today. Burnout spells are quite
effective on a short term basis while grouping (getting rid of that strong
monster everyone is having trouble with), but it's almost worthless while
going solo. Burnout spells almost eliminates the natural regeneration of
pet hit points and adds to their strength and armor. Unless you have something
like an Earth elemental that can take the damage and still dish it out,
dont bother with this spell. It's extremely useful to cast it on a pet
before a battle, when grouping, and have the group tank (most likely the
warrior or shadowknight) take the blunt of the damage instead of your pet.
Your first Burnout spell comes at level 12.
<p><b>PvPing Magicians?</b>
<br>Unless you are playing on one of the PvP Team servers or playing on
Rallos Zek server, you are completely safe from anyone who wants to randomly
Player Kill you, unless you use the Book of Order and Discord on the Priest
of Discord. However, there will come a time when you will want to test
your own strength against others, or perhaps you just dont like that High
Elf (mortal enemies of Dark Elves) running around Nektulos? Whatever the
reason, the only way to can engage in PvP is by using the /duel command.
Once the other player uses the duel command themselves, the chaos begins.
Magicians are at a natural loss when it comes to PvP due to the low hit
points and weaker-than-wizards burn spells, however with a little faith
and few tactics (and some luck!) you will come out clean and alive.
<br>First of all, be sure your pet is within the 4 level PvP limit of the
enemy player. Elementals follow the level limit just like players, and
you will find that a level 4 pet will refuse to attack a level 9 player
in a duel (because it cant!). If you know the exact level of your pet,
and your opponent too, the battle will go smoothly.
<br>Open with a fire shield spell. It <i>always </i>helps in PvP. If you
are attacking something like a warrior, use the circle strafe technique
to confuse your opponent while you and your pet hits in melee. This really
doesnt work well against magic users since they only need to target you
to cast spells, not needing a Line of Sight. Go into melee if your target
is a magic user. The more interuptions the enemy has, the better. This
will be enhanced by the fact that the enemy will have two things attacking
them (pet and you). Be sure to cast spells the moment after you see that
red message saying the enemy tried to hit you (or did hit you), as this
will allow you to cast a spell without getting interupted since normal
burn spells have less of a casting delay than most melee attacks (especially
true against 2 Handed weapons!). If your opponent has a pet themselves,
count on a lot of spell disruptions on both sides, but always attack the
player. The pet dies if the caster dies.
<p><b><font size=+1>Step 7: Where to Hunt?</font></b>
<br><font size=+0>This section will outline where, and how to, hunt in
by zone. Read carefully as you will be mainly KoS everywhere you if you
stray from the beaten path.</font>
<p><b><font size=+0>Nektulos Forest, Suggested Level: 4-9</font></b>
<br><font size=+0>Around the time you get your first elemental is the time
to return to your homeland. Follow the nearby path from Neriak and start
hunting spiderlings and fire beetles which inhabit the left side of the
road. Once you get to level 5, hunt on the right side of the road, killing
large spiders, shadow wolves, black bears, and skeletons. Beware the skeletons,
for they often pack more than you can handle if they are wielding weapons.
Large spiders carry the best of the best loot in this area, so be sure
to bring a few backpacks. The spider (note: NOT spiderling) silk they carry
sells for over a gold apiece, although it cant be stacked. Black bears
are good to hunt if you are planning to raise your tailoring skill anytime
soon, as ruined bear belts will produce the patchwork armor needed for
your fellow trolls and ogres. Sometimes they even give low/medium/high
quality bear pelts, which are almost always in demand by tailors (medium
for studded, high for quivers and backpacks, etc..). Shadow wolves, like
the black wolves before them, carry the ruined wolf pelts needed for dark
elven patchwork armor. Once you hit level 7 or so, start grouping up at
the Skeleton Pyramid (follow the first fork in the road) or the Obelisk
(next to the zone exit to East Commons). The skeletons there spawn at a
good sized rate, but watch out for the occasional mummy that spawns! At
around 8th and up you can kill the halfling druids (the fork going to the
right just before the bridge) with a good success rate, but I personally
wouldnt. Those halflings give very little loot and will gang up on you
if you attack a single one. That, combined with the fact that the halfling
deputy or medic make occasional appearances (they are high level, and will
kill you easily) make the shrine worthless to hunt in.</font>
<p><b><font size=+0>West Freeport, Suggested Level: 1-4</font></b>
<br><font size=+0>The ultimate newbie hunting grounds, West Freeport spawns
creatures in a confined area so you never even need to search for prey.
This is where the word 'hunting' is replaced with 'killing'. New dark elves
should start on giant rats, snakes, and bats. The giant rats give the best
loot as they have many things that are sold for around a silver apiece
that are stackable, but ditch the non-stackable fangs however. Bats are
always profitable to hunt since they never spawn anything that you cant
stack, but the only problem is that bats only come out at night. Snakes
are good, but only one thing on them (snake skins) is really of worth.
Skeletons can be hunted from level 2 and up, and they give great loot!
Weapons you can sharpen and then sell, as well as bone chips (for your
fellow necromancers). The most profitable of the monsters here are the
Deathfist Pawns. They have not only weapons (however, ditch the picks if
you dont want to do the Neriak Warrior quests), but also cloth armor you
can sell and wear! A rare spawn in this zone are wolves. This things are
higher level than the black wolves from Nektulos, and will kill you easily
at your level without proper protection.</font>
<p><b><font size=+0>East Commonlands, Suggested Level: 5-10</font></b>
<br><font size=+0>One of the more diverse zones near Neriak, East Commonlands
(often refered to as EC) carries a wide range of creatures to hunt. At
around level 5, you'll be looking for black bears and more fire beetles,
although I suggest Nekulos as a better place to hunt at this level. Once
you hit level 8 and gain your next pet as well as Shock of Blades or Flame
Bolt, go hunt Darkweed Snakes, but be sure to watch out for it's poison!
The poison it carries is stronger than the large spiders and other nasties
you met earlier. Be ever on the watch for the wondering Young Kodiak (and
worst of all, the Griffon!), which can devastate even the most hardened
magician at this level. The great thing about these snakes is that they
often carry Giant Snake Fangs, a commonly prized weapon (piercing, 5 dmg
27 delay) of low level rogues and magic users, even though it's not magical.</font>
<p><b>Ocean of Tears - Erollisi Isle, Suggested Level: 12+</b>
<br>Ok, so it's not exactly for newbies, but it's worth a great mention
for dark elves. Once you hit level 12 and gain the next step in pets (and
Bind Affinity spell!), ask others of your level if they want to group up
and come hunt on the Sister Isle. When you can a good sized party (3+ members
should do it), go to East Freeport (invisible of course) and jump on the
boat that leaves there. Once you zone into the Ocean of Tears zone, take
a vigil lookout on the rightside of the boat. If you spot land, jump off
and swim toward it (making sure the party follows suit), as the wood elf
who guards the docks oftentimes kills dark elves on sight. As long as you
dont go near the town portion of the island, you'll be remotely safe for
now. Use your group tactics to kill the Sisters of Erollisi (DIE SYLVAN!!!).
Not only are they great exp for your level, but the loot they have is fantastic:
Purity Belts (3AC, +2STR, +2STA, Medium Sized Leather Armor) and sometimes
Research components. Purity Belts sell normally 3-4 platinums to other
players and 1 platinums to NPC merchants, making them your main money maker
at this level, which is good considering that once you hit level 16 you'll
be needing the research components they carry as well as the money to buy
new spells. Note: The ones dressed up in chainmail armor are lower level
than those dressed up in leather armor, so hunt those first to get a hang
of things. Beware the halberds they wield!
<p><b>Befallen, Suggested Level: 6+</b>
<br>The first of the 'newbie' dungeons you'll encounter as a dark elf,
Befallen is a necromancer's dream come true: Skeletons and various other
undead things roam freely within these halls. To get to Befallen, travel
to the ridge on the desert side of East Commonlands and then zone into
West Commonlands by heading west. Continue to follow the ridgeline west
until you see a hole in the side of the ridge (in night there's a light
coming from the hole so it's hard to miss). Welcome to Befallen. Hunt the
skeletons in the first level (you'll know it's the first level since there's
a door in the main hall that wont open without a key. It goes down to level
2), but do not kill anything if 'skeleton Lrodd' is nearby. He's a very
high level (in comparison to you) skeleton that will quickly react to protect
it's own kind. You have been warned. Another thing to note in here is shadowknight
and necromancer NPCs, which obviously are exactly like their player counterparts
in respect to their skills and spells. The shadowknight is widely hunted
because he's the only one that carries the key to level 2, but if you do
decide to kill him, beware! He has Harm Touch ability and knows how to
use it. Harm Touch effectively deals damage that's almost enough to kill
you outright. Best to let someone else take the Touch than have yourself
drained from full hit points to almost dead in just a second. All in all,
this dungeon just plain bites loot-wise, but is great for experience.
<p><b>Crushbone, Suggested Level: Dont even think about it!</b>
<br>Although a favorate hunting spot for many, Crushbone is one place you
want to stay away from at all levels! Not only is it on the Continent of
Feydwer, the Crushbone Orcs are allied with the warriors of Neriak. Kill
an orc and you lower faction with the Indigo Brotherhood, also known as
the Neriak Warrior's Guild (and many would argue the guards as well). Not
good. However, if you gain enough faction in Crushbone Orcs (kill Sisters
of Erollisi for this) that you con dubiously to them, go hunt some elf
slaves, which in turn raises your faction with the Indigo Brotherhood.
In short, hunting in Crushbone is a surefire way of destroying reputation
in Neriak.
