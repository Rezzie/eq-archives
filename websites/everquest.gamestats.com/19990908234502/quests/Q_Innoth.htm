<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp; This is a massive
quest involving most of the cities in Norrath.&nbsp; See the full quest
description in <a href="Q_Akanon.htm#Going Postal">AK'Anon</a>.</b>
<p><a NAME="Lyunga's Gem Collection"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Lyunga's
Gem Collection:</font>&nbsp; In the Innothule swamp, you talk to Lyunga,
a wandering NPC troll female that can usually be found near the entrance
to Guk.&nbsp; After level 10 or so she will tell you that she collects
gems. By the upper teens, she will tell you about her gem collection and
that she wants more.&nbsp; Ask her what gems and she will tell you that
she wants a ruby. In return for the ruby, she gives one of several items.&nbsp;
Ones I know of are the Brutechopper axe, <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Midnight_Mallet.html">Midnight
Mallet</a></font> and <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Ivander's_Hoop.htm">Ivandyr's
Hoop</a></font>.&nbsp; FYI, giving her champer's ruby from Rivervale will
not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; The criteria for what you get seems unclear and could
just be random.&nbsp; (Submitted by Trallak and Uggluk)</b>

Severed Arm:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Lork wants you to find
his brother Nork's dismembered body from a fat alligator in Innothule Swamp.&nbsp;
Kill the alligator and recover Nork's severed arm.&nbsp; Take it back to
Lork and he will give you a Broken Stein to take to the ogre trainer Uglan
in Neriak. CAUTION - Uglan will kill shamen or shadowknights on sight.&nbsp;
Uglan will then ask you to intercept a Blue Orc Runner and get a letter
off of him and return it to Lork.&nbsp; The letter details a conspiracy
between the Crushbone Orcs and the dark elves against the ogres.&nbsp;
For a reward, Lork will give you an item, sometimes a </font><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Crude_Stein.htm">Crude
Stein</a></font><font color="#000000">.&nbsp; Then, as pay back, Lork wants
you to bring him the hearts of Lord Crushbone and the dark elf ambassador
who visits the shaman guild in Oggok.&nbsp; The dark elf ambassador&nbsp;
is named K'ryn and he is located in komarr's caves (the tunnels).&nbsp;
If you enter the tunnels through the bottom right tunnel, contune through
the tunnels until you reach the shaman trainers you should go to the right
and there will be six or so ogres who sell the shaman spells.&nbsp; In
that room there is another tunnel which will bring you to a room with about
five different passages.&nbsp; In one of those passages waits the dark
elf ambassador.&nbsp; You need to kill him and get his heart.&nbsp; (he
also often drops a dragoon dagger).&nbsp; For killing K'ryn, you lose faction
with IndigoBrotherhood, but gain with EmeraldWarriors and SteelWarriors.&nbsp;
The Lord Crushbone is the always camped D'Vinn.&nbsp; You need to kill
him as well and get his heart.&nbsp; Once you have both hearts, return
them to Lork and be prepared to receive your big reward from the grateful
ogre - Some rawhide armor!&nbsp; Well at least you should get some dragoon
daggers while doing the quest.&nbsp; Basically, the only reason to do this
quest is if you happen to stumble across these two dragoons and kill them
and want to get rid of their hearts.&nbsp; (Submitted by Oglug,Vaprak and

This quest is also given by Hulkulk's assistant in the Shadowknight Guild.&nbsp;
You have to get the head of the Spore Guardian.&nbsp; The Spore Guardian
spawns in the Innothule swamp, and it's corpse sometimes has a "Huge Mushroom
Head".&nbsp; Giving the mushroom head to the the correct troll in the SK
guild hall will get you a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Froglock_Skin_Mask.htm">Froglok
