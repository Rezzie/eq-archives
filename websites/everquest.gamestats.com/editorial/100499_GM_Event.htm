<p><b>Note:&nbsp; This describes a GM event which actually took place on
several servers over the weekend.</b>
<p><b>GM event on Mithaniel Marr</b>
<p><b>I, Dendil Coup'De'Grace, relate this story to you, for your enlightenment.
After being consistently disappointed in my efforts to retrieve the fabled
Paladin holy sword, Ghoulbane, I decided to travel to the Estate of Unrest,
to take my frustrations out on some of it's occupants.&nbsp; Having recently
attained the 28th circle of training, I decided to enter the vile house
without my usual invisibility to undead, to see which of the inhabitants
where brave enough to face me.&nbsp; Much as I suspected, there where too
many of the beasts, and I had to run to safety. I was meditating and healing
in Dagnor's cauldron when a poor dwarf collapsed at my feet. Fortunately
I had sufficient mana to heal him, and when he regained consciousness,
he told me he had to take important news to his king, and told me to gather
a party to escort him.&nbsp; I called upon help, and 3 brave individuals
came forward, Cascas, Golle, and Bolaun. We made haste to the Dwarven king,
who upon receiving the information, summoned his Heir, Brec Stormhammer,
and his champions to his side. He said we would have to go and do a task
for him, but that we must have a Dwarven or Gnome, cleric or Paladin to
lead us.&nbsp; Fortunately, one of my guild brothers, Kinken, a dwarven
cleric was in the vicinity, so we could continue the quest. We made haste
to Dagnors Cauldron once more, and after some searching, found a hoard
of Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords under the water, and, pulling them to shore,
we began to slaughter them. Brec told us that we must enter the water one
more time, to face another foe, which turned out to be a large, almost
frog like creature named Phinigel. By now word of our adventure has spread,
and many more had come to our aid, and we eventually defeated the creature,
which had in its possession an item of great importance, we realised that
we must make haste to the King once more. Things where not quite as they
seemed though, for on our journey out of Dagnor, we where attacked by 4
Dark elves, of great power (/ooc red at level 45 at least…) who proceeded
to slaughter us. Brec fell quickly, being the focus of their attacks, and
the item was stolen. I too fell in the initial combat. (/ooc and many thanks
to Fara, (hope I got the name right) who gated me back to G fay from HH
keep) I rejoined the battle in Greater Faydark, by now there where very
many there to join the battle!&nbsp; /ooc in fact, it turned into a farce
for a while, with the DE being almost impossible to kill, at the point
of death, we could&nbsp; suddenly no longer hit them, like they where charmed,
or had become an actual player character.&nbsp; Some of the PC's in the
zone even killed the one surviving dwarven GM, delaying the resumption
of the quest. I had lost most of my companions by this stage, but I soon
found more, my guild sister and fellow paladin Adainiel, and my guild brothers,
Dwarven clerics Kinken and Bolaun, plus two others, the bard Chillawack
and the mighty wizard Machin. The dark ones where eventually slain, after
a long battle, and we retrieved the box. We made haste back to Kaladim
and the King, but the quest proved not to be over quite yet, as the foul
ones had locked the item in a box. One of the kings closest knew that the
key was in the possession of the Captain of the Teir'dal guards. The King
appointed a new Champion, the mighty Grundel and charged him with the task
of retreiving the key, Grundel gathered a party from the most powerful,
(/ooc His guild it seemed…) and they gated to Nektulos. Being so lucky
as to have Machin still with us, we followed, but arrived to late to help,
the captain having already fallen. The key was retrieved! We gated back
to Kaladim, and the King opened the box himself. The King then appointed
Grundel as his champion, to replace the fallen Brec, (Grundel is now called
Grundel Dwarven Champion) The king gave the item, a mighty relic, to Grundel
to wield. (stats where not confirmed, Grundel chose not to answer me, but
I was informed that it was called the Hammer of Brell, [ed note: actually
it was a <a href="../graphics6/Butcherblock_Hammer.htm">Butcherblock Hammer</a>]
). Cascas was also rewarded with a Mithril 2Hander, Machin received a Shiny
Metallic Robe, and I received a short sword of the Ysheka. A rogue also
received a serrated bone dirk, but I have alas forgotten his name. Adainiel
and Bolaun also where rewarded with gems, and I believe others where given
similar rewards.</b>
