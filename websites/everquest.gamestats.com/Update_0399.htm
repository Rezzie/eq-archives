<br><b>March, 1999</b></center>

<p><b><font color="#000066">March 31, 1999:&nbsp; I have written a </font><a href="GuideWiz.htm">Guide
to Playing an Erudite Wizard</a> <font color="#000066">which is linked
through the player's guide sections on wizards and erudites.&nbsp; It covers
creating and playing an Erudite Wizard through level 8.&nbsp; For those
of you who have tried to get onto the message board and not enjoyed the
hassle Delphi puts you through, I have been assured that they are changing
their codes to make it easier to use.&nbsp; This should be done within
a week.&nbsp; I like the layout of the Delphi board, and it even has a
nice chat feature.&nbsp; I figure most people will go to EQ Vault or EQ
Stratics for messages, but feel free to use the board and chat as much
as you want.&nbsp; At least it won't overload when the server goes down.&nbsp;
Also added links to the following areas:&nbsp; Steamfont.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 30, 1999:&nbsp; Added links to two nice
personal pages dedicated to specific classes:&nbsp; The Enchanter's Realm
and Bohica's Lair (Troll Shaman).&nbsp; These are in the player's guide
and the general links section.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bohica also had maps to Grobb
and Innothule which are now linked.&nbsp; Also added 2 new map links for
Kelethin.</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066"><b>March 29, 1999:&nbsp; I must say I'm amazed.&nbsp;
I've gone over 10,000 hits since I put this up somewhat on a whim 2 weeks
ago.&nbsp; I appreciate all the people who have come here to get information
and have e-mailed me with suggestions.&nbsp; Keep it up.&nbsp; Thank you
to Games First for mentioning my player's guide in their review of Everquest.&nbsp;
You can read the review </b><a href="http://www.gamesfirst.com/Reviews/EQ/eq.htm">HERE</a>
. <b>I updated the links to the Norrathian travel agency to reflect that
it is now part of EQ Stratics.&nbsp; They should be good again.&nbsp; I
have changed the frames to make the index frames smaller and less obtrusive.&nbsp;
Hopefully, it will satisfy both the people who want easy navigation and
those who don't want any clutter (then again probably not).</b></font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 27, 1999:&nbsp; Thank you to Sony for
mentioning my page in its news section.&nbsp; Because it seemed to be the
most requested feature, I have added a new section to the player's guide
listing the commands in the game.&nbsp; I also added links to the following
sections:&nbsp; Qeynos, Halas, Grobb,&nbsp; Jewelry making, Brewing.&nbsp;
For those of you who don't want to view the Player's Guide in Frames, simply
bring it up in a separate window.&nbsp; I have left the table of contents
at the top of the guide so that it can be used without the index frame
if you prefer it that way.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 26, 1999:&nbsp; Assuming you came through
the first page and don't have this page bookmarked, you should notice a
dramatic improvement in the look of this page.&nbsp; If you bookmarked
this and wonder where to find the guide,click the link above to get the
framed page.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still have a lot to do, but the main Everquest
page and the Player's guide should now be in frames and hopefully easier
to use and nicer to look at.&nbsp; I also added a tip on the /loc command
in the tips section.&nbsp; I have chosen to keep the player's guide intact
despite the size of it so that it can be easily downloaded or printed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I of course welcome feedback on the design.&nbsp; It is my hope to make
this as user friendly as possible.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 25, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp; Big addition today.&nbsp;
I have finished my guide to the cities and zones of Norrath.&nbsp; Most
of the cities and zones are covered, with some having more detail than
others.&nbsp; I would appreciate any feedback on this, especially as to
monsters or zones I missed or mistakes I have made on descriptions or playing
levels.&nbsp; Because of its size, I have made it a separate area from
the Player's Guide.&nbsp; You can either access it from the table of contents
of the player's guide or from the link on this page.&nbsp; I also added
links to the following sections:&nbsp; Ranger, Druid, Shaman, Necromancer,
Magician, Rogue and Tailoring.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 23, 1999:&nbsp; Congratulations to Sony
for having the sense to give everyone 2 extra free weeks for going through
the hassle of playing (or not playing) over the past week.&nbsp; This is
a great game, and they should keep their fans happy.&nbsp; More updates.&nbsp;
I added a lot of new links to the maps section, with links to the maps
on EQ Online and the official maps on Sony's Everquest home page.&nbsp;
There are now maps to every major city and many of the more popular hunting
grounds.&nbsp; If you know of more maps. I also added links for several
of the major trade skills.&nbsp; There are now links to guides for Baking,
Blacksmithing, Bowyering, Fishing, Fletching, Jewelry Making, Pottery and
Tailoring.&nbsp; As I find out more information, I will flesh out those
guides.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 22, 1999:&nbsp; Added a new section to
the Player's Guide for maps and travel guides.&nbsp; There are now links
in that section to maps or guides for most of the major cities in Norrath
through EQ Vault, EQ Stratics and The Norrathian Travel Agency.&nbsp; As
with the rest of the guide, I will add more as I find them.&nbsp; I also
added links to the following sections:&nbsp; Shadow Knight, Rogue, Warrior,
General Classes, Wood Elf, Erudin, Gnome, High Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, Troll,
Barbarian and Half Elf.&nbsp; If you know of other links I should add,
let me know.&nbsp; I am working on my own guide to playing an Erudite Wizard,
and should have it done in a few days.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 19, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added links
to the following sections:&nbsp; Magician, Enchanter, Necromancer, Wizard,
Group Combat.&nbsp; Changed the skills section so that I can start to add
links and information about the various trade skills.&nbsp; The only one
on there right now is fishing.&nbsp; I will add others as I get the time.&nbsp;
I'm trying to make this more user friendly.&nbsp; If you want any other
feature added, please e-mail me and let me know.&nbsp; Also, if you know
of a good link to add, e-mail me and I will check it out.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 18, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changed the
format of the Everquest Main Page to keep the updates up front so that
you can tell when changes have been made to the Guide.&nbsp; I'll jazz
it up a little when I get more time.&nbsp; Added Links in Player's Guide
to several new Ranger Guides on EQ Stratics.&nbsp; Added more tips.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 17, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Added a section
on choosing a server to the EQ player's guide.&nbsp; Made some updates
and changes to the section on starting statistics.&nbsp; Added new links
to the following sections: Cleric, Monk, Necomancer, Paladin, Ranger, Shadow
Knight, Wizard, Statistics, Deities, Trades.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 16, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Site is now
included in Everring.&nbsp; Added some new links and graphics to several
sections of the player's guide.&nbsp; Added some new links to the general
links section.</font></b>
<p><font color="#000066"><b>March 14, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some serious
updates made to the classes section of the players guide with more information
and additional links</b>.</font>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 13, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Updated the
Players Guide with some new graphics and additional links to the players
guides located on EQ'Lizer.&nbsp; This should provide a lot more information
than before.&nbsp; Also Changed the layout of the Everquest main page.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000066">March 11, 1999:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp;
Added this nice new update section which will track the additions made
to the page.&nbsp; Added a page dedicated to the game Infinite Worlds.&nbsp;
Added a page dedicated to The Realm.&nbsp; Created a Delphi discussion
Forum (message board) and placed a link on the Everquest page.&nbsp; Also
updated Players guide with some additional links and added a Table of Contents.</font></b>
