<p><a NAME="Darla Starfire:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Darla Starfire:</font>&nbsp;
Talk to the female guildmaster in the necro hut.&nbsp; She wants you to
kill Darla Starfire, a level 5ish NPC who is supplying the hated Kerrans.&nbsp;
You will be rewarded for turning in her head.&nbsp; (Submitted by Doriath)</b>
<p><a NAME="Heretic Battle"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Heretic battle:&nbsp;</font>
Markus Jaevins, the Magician Guildmaster, will ask you to get the heretic's
remains from Jailmaster Lius.&nbsp; Lius will tell you that the heretic
escaped.&nbsp; the heritics are the various Necromancers wandering around
Tox Forest.&nbsp; If you bring the remains of any heretic to Markus he
will reward you.&nbsp; Kill one of them and return his remains for experience,
faction and a reward.&nbsp; Your faction raises with High Counsel of Erudin
and High Guard of Erudin, and lowers with Heritics.&nbsp; I don't know
if the reward is greater if you kill Talliger, who is the most powerful
heretic.&nbsp; (Submitted by Aoiryuu and Fellus)</b>
<p><a NAME="Kobald Shaman Paws (T)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Kobald
Shaman Paws:</font>&nbsp; This quest starts in Erudin.&nbsp; The Cleric
Guildmaster apparantly has a feud with the Kobald Shamen.&nbsp; Some sort
of religious dispute I guess.&nbsp; She is a bloodthirsty sort and wants
you to return with the paws of her enemies.&nbsp; Go kill Kobald Shamen
in Tox forest and return with two paws and you will be rewarded.</b>
<p><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><a NAME="Mining Caps"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Mining
caps:</font>&nbsp; The NPC necro Talriger Eklorin, who is walking around
in the forest on the other side of the bridge, wants to employ a young
necromancer to retrieve some mining caps for his skeleton workers in the
mine. Apparantly, these skeletons will not continue to&nbsp; work without
the caps.&nbsp; The caps are sometimes dropped by kobald scouts (though
not often).&nbsp; Providing these caps will result in experience, faction,
some nice money and an item.&nbsp; He only gives the quest to those he
likes (and doesn't KOS). (Submitted by Allart and Zooky)</b>
<p><a NAME="Poacher Heads (T)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Poacher Heads:</font>&nbsp;
This quest starts in Erudin.&nbsp; Those nasty poachers wandering around
Toxxulia haven't just annoyed you.&nbsp; They've apparantly pissed off
one of the townspeople who stands just outside the Temple of Quellios.&nbsp;
His request is a little gruesome, but hey it's a barbaric world out there.&nbsp;
Bring him head of a poacher and he will reward you with a little money,
experience and faction.&nbsp; The faction adjustments are as follows:&nbsp;
KaranaBandits worse;&nbsp; KaranaResidents better;&nbsp; GuardsofQeynos
better;&nbsp; HighpassGuards better;&nbsp; CircleofUnseenHands better.</b>

Erudites.&nbsp; He can generally be located somewhere along the shore from
the bridge to the mountainside.&nbsp; He is fairly tough to kill since
he casts blindness on his adversaries.&nbsp; Take his head to Marzius Denison
at the necromancer's hut and you will get some money and an item.</b>

some money and some faction.&nbsp; You may also get an additional quest.</b>
