Bind:</font>&nbsp; Llscent Tagglefoot by the druids guild is in a bind.&nbsp;
He will say he needs somone to deliver a case of jumjum juice to Xanuusus
a treant in the Northern Karanas Plains. Say "I will take the Jumjum Juice"
and you will be provided with a case. Getting to Treant is a long walk.&nbsp;
Go to North Karana and follow the water to the right.&nbsp; When you hit
the mountains follow them and you will run right into him.&nbsp; I have
been told you no longer have to levitate to give him the jum jum juice.&nbsp;
Also, apparantly Xanuusus is not smart enough or just doesn't care to distinguish
between the jum jum you get from Llscent and that you find from looting
bixies.&nbsp; Who's going to argue with a Treant?&nbsp; So any case of
jum jum juice will work.&nbsp; Factions go up with StormReapers, MayorGubbin,
and MerchantsofRiverVale, and went down with the UnkemptDruids.&nbsp; You
will also get some minor coin and a minor item.&nbsp; Considering that
bixies are very low level creatures and drop jum jum quite frequently,
this may be a good way for low level characters to make some money (Assuming
you survive the trek through N Karana).&nbsp; (Submitted by Kozmo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Corrupt Guards (NK)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Corrupt Guards:</font>&nbsp;
Capt. Linarius at the top of the bridge tower on the edge of the Northern
Plains of Karana wants you do help him root out corruption among the guards.&nbsp;
He will ask you to seek out and find any corrupt guards, to kill them and
bring back their guard bracelets to him.&nbsp; Now there is a guard tower
located between the river and the valley which leads to Qeynos Hills on
the Northern Plains, it's near the mountains. In this guard tower is a
guard named Guard Donlan.&nbsp; When you talk to Donlan you discover that
he is charging people a travel tax of 1 gp to travel on the roads.&nbsp;
Kill him and return his bracelet for experience, faction, some money and
a minor item.&nbsp; (Submitted by Tarn)</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp; This is a massive

Mrysila in the gypsy camp has a quest for good magic users. Give her a
lightstone and she will give you either Runes &amp; Research Volume I or
Runes &amp;</b>
<br><b>Research Volume II.&nbsp; Be warned that what you get is random
and not dependant upon which one you already have.&nbsp; I got two volume
ones for my two lightstones.&nbsp; For a greater lightstone she will give
you the Concordance of Research, which is what you use to combine the ingredients
to get the practice runes.&nbsp; The research materials are (or will soon
be) posted on Mithiran Tower. [Thanks Wester Windwolf for helping me on
this quest]. (Submitted by Washoo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Winds of Karana"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Winds of Karana:</font>&nbsp;
This is another of the multiple part quests. When heading into Southern
Karana, from Northern Karana mind you, there is a tower just before the
bridge. Just outside the tower doors are four very large horn like structures.
Standing beside one is a female bard. If you talk to her, and ask if there
is anything you can do for her, she relays a sad story of a hermit who
stole her flute. Now, head into Southern Karana. Head straight south, making
sure to give a wide berth to the Grave Yard of Lord Grimrot. About half
way through the zone is a fountain, with Vhalen standing there. Vhalen,
who is also the object of the broken Lute quest for bards, has an offer
for you. He will complete his latest masterpiece for you. Of course, he
needs something for this. Two sheets of a song. Pages 1 and 2 of the Winds
of Karana. He tells you of a man who has stolen these pages. A vile man
of a Hermit. Sound familiar eh? Now, head southeast till you see a cottage.
It has a hexagonal wall of stone surrounding it, so it's not hard to find.
Inside the walls is "a hermit." A very unfriendly sort. Here's where the
quests takes one of two paths. The door to the hermits house is either
locked, or broken and won't open. So it's hard to get to him. If you slide
past the door slowly you may be able to see him and target him. Now, if
you want to talk to him, you can go behind the house, stand EXACTLY against
the chimney that protrudes and banter with him. He's very hard to convince
to talk, and the sentence basically has to say something to the effect
of "where is the flute" though this isn't the exact wording, (I got it
right once out of 6 attempts) Now, if you do talk to him, he has twoquests
you can achieve from him (More on these later) in which you kill two people
and bring proof to him for the Flute and the Page. Now, as it's hard to
get through the door, and thus hard to exchange the items to him, there
is ONE other manner to do this quest. Target him, as before, and begin
an attack. Spells will draw him out just fine. After he is dead, his body
will contain the Flute, Page 1 of the Winds of Karana or just one or the
other. At this point, some factions will go up, down and you will no doubt
gain some good experience. I estimate him to be around level 19-20. Now,
head back into Northern Karana, and hand the flute over to the bard sitting
against the pillar. She, as thanks, will give you Page 2 of the winds of
Karana, some experience, faction and occasionally a small cash reward.&nbsp;
You</b> <b>are almost complete. Head back into Southern Karana and hand
both the pages to Vhalen at the same time. You will gain Faction, a small
amount of money, and a Bard song. This song appears to be random. I got
the 3rd song, another got the 4th song.&nbsp; (Submitted by Myen).</b>
