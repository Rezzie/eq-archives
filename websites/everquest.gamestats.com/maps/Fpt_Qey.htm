<center><b>ROUTE FROM WEST FREEPORT TO QEYNOS</b></center>

<p><b>If you are under level 5 then I would not take this trip yet because
if the amount of risk involved.</b>
<p><b>If you are under level 10 then it is a good idea to drop any important
items into the bank BEFORE you make this trip, it will be long and hard
and don't expect not to die the first time if you try this on your own.
My advice would be to get another player who is of a higher level or has
experience in this trip to guide you. Also make sure that you have a lot
of Water and food, I would recommend getting about 10 of each as the journey
is long, however this isn't essential because you can purchase some on
your way.</b>
<p><b>You could also get someone to cast a spell called Spirit of Wolf
(SOW) on you which will make you run faster and will reduce the time this
trip takes (normally a few hours earth time) and will maybe save your life.
However SOW does not last forever and you may need a re-cast to complete
the journey. Please note that Bards cannot cast SOW no matter what level
as well as many other classes. Classes that can are (depending on their
level) Druids (at level 14) and Shamen (at level 9).</b>
<p><b>Also reading both the Good and Evil Races routes is a good idea because
there maybe tips in one which I have missed in the other.</b>
<p><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b>
<br><b>GOOD Races Route (and some Evil Races)</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West Freeport.</b>
<p><b>This is a newbie zone so you should not have a problem with this
zone.&nbsp; Go out of the Gates of Freeport and walk directly away (gates
behind you) from the gates towards the zone to East Commonlands.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; East Commonlands.</b>
<p><b>This zone gets a little bit harder. The route is once you have zoned
from Freeport is to follow the right hand wall of the zone.&nbsp; Follow
the right wall of the zone after a little while you will see an opening
in the wall (Plus 1200, Plus 900) this is the zone entrance to the Dark
Elf Area called Nektulos Forrest. This place should be avoided at all costs
unless you are of an evil race or a high level (20+) good race.&nbsp; Continue
to follow the right wall keeping as high up the wall as possible. You will
then pass a large orc camp on your left. As you pass the orc camp be careful
of one of the orcs that is sometimes slightly up the wall, however if you
are high enough up the wall he will ignore you. Then you will pass an Inn
and then another smaller Orc Camp both slightly on your left.&nbsp; After
you have passed this last Orc Camp the zone (Plus 1200, Plus 5000) isn't
far so keep going until you zone into West Commonlands</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West Commonlands.</b>
<p><b>This Zone is hard for people even if your level is in the Teens.
You MUST be careful of all monsters here, as a lot of them will Kill On
Site (KOS) and "seem" to roam randomly around the zone.</b>
<p><b>As you are already on the right of the zone the best route to take
is to follow the right hand wall as high as you can like you did in East
Commonlands. You will pass a building that looks like a tower with some
skeletons (and maybe zombies) however they will not touch you if you are
high up the right wall. Then you will pass a very big Dervish Camp.&nbsp;
The next camp you will encounter will be a very big Orc Camp. You will
not be able to go up the wall for this camp so you will need to go into
the open and walk around it. You must make sure that there are no kodaks
and roaming orcs, in fact any monsters walking around the area (Make yourself
invisible if you can). Then walk around the Orc camp and get back on the
right hand wall as soon as you have passed the Orc Camp. Follow the right
hand wall and you will eventually reach an opening in the far corner of
the zone (Plus 900, Plus 4000) that will take you to Kiticor Forest.</b>
<p><b>(Alternative Route)</b>
<p><b>If you want to you can follow the left side of the zone in the Desert.
All you do is go as high up the left side of the wall as you can and keep
going. Watch out for any Hill Giants (Approx. level 34) which sometimes
roam the area.&nbsp; This is why I personally prefer the right side of
the zone. However if you take this side there is a zone to Befallen which
you can use if you get in trouble (Minus 900, Plus 500).</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kiticor Forest.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>You now have two choices on which route to take. Rivervale way or
Highhold pass. They both eventually meet up in the same place.&nbsp; Highhold
is harder (in some circumstances) than the Rivervale route. However the
Rivervale route is a bit longer and can be dangerous in the Gorge of King
Xorbb or Runnyeye.&nbsp; This is an on going argument on which way is the
best way to go. One of the deciding factors is if you can cast invisible
or camouflage then its probably best to try Highold pass as the monsters
will not see you if you are invisible. However if you cannot then it may
be safer to go the Rivervale route.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have made your choice then...</b>
<p><b>In Kithicor Forest To Highhold.</b>
<p><b>Follow the path, do not deviate from it as there are some high level
monsters here, athough they are very few and in between and you are not
likely to see them. Take the following Turnings along the path - Right,
Right, Right, Left. You will come to the zone (Plus 500, Plus 2000) of
Highhold pass</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>In Kithicor Forest To Rivervale.</b>
<p><b>Follow the path, again do not deviate from it as there are some high
level monsters here although they are very few and in between and you are
not likely to see them. Take the following turnings along the path - Right,
Right, Right, Right. You will come to an entrance cut into the rock face
which is the zone (Plus 2000, Plus 3800) entrance to Rivervale.</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highhold Pass Route.</b>
<p><b>As you zone into highhold, Orcs will spawn just around the corner.
These Orcs are about level 18+. Normally people are camping the spawn of
Orcs so they normally busy however you may not be so lucky. If there are
some Orcs you will see them just a few steps into the zone. It is probably
a good idea to ask someone to give you directions to Highhold Keep as Highhold
is like a maze and can get very confusing on your own and for the first
time (I still take wrong turnings sometimes).&nbsp; The route goes through
a tunnel.&nbsp; Then a left turn to where you see a bridge and a guard.&nbsp;
Then a right turn (do not cross the bridge) which follows a path to a fork
where you turn right to the entrance to Highpass Keep.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you get to Highold Keep you will then need to ask the person
or maybe another if they can show you the way to the zone of East Karanas.
This is because going out of Highhold is also a problem as this side there
are Gnolls and again they are high level (Level 15+).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>If however you decide to go it alone when follow these instructions.
NB: I originally wrote this when my Bard was at level 16 and the Orcs were
conning red so be careful now at level 30 they ignore me. :)</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have zoned into highhold follow the path straight under
an arch turn left and go up towards a Guard and cross over the wooden bridge.
Follow the road down to the left and you will come to another wooden bridge
that runs over a river on your left, you will also see Tigers Roar on your
left that you can normally rest or buy provisions there if you want to.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>When you are ready follow the other path from Tigers Roar straight
up the hill which will veer you to the left at the start then turn right
at the next junction. You will go down a narrow bank that at the bottom
you should turn left. You should pass buy a NPC then turn left at the next
junction and go over a couple fallen logs on the floor. At this point there
may be high level Gnolls patrolling, however the zone isn't far and must
make a run for it. One word of warning though some of the Gnolls are mages
and they are capable of rooting and hit hard however if you run really
quickly they normally don't get time to cast before you zone. You will
go under an arch and quickly after zone to East Karanas.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>East Karanas (from Highhold Pass Route).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have zoned into East Karanas follow the valley down to the
right. You will eventually come to a tower and a crossing to the other
side of the pass. Cross over to the left and follow the left wall all the
way down.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Try to avoid looking over the edge of this cliff as you can attract
Griffons (Level 34+) or Griffawns (Level 18+) or you can plunge to your
death if you go a little too far. Also keep your eye out for roaming monsters
on the way down which might attack you.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you get to the bottom of the pass follow the windy path avoiding
all Lions and Wolves etc. as these KOS and are about level 13+. Also if
you do get in trouble follow the path and you will get to a junction, turn
left and run towards the buildings where the guards "should" help you.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Following the path you will come to a junction in the road which
you must take a right turning. Follow the path until another junction.
There will also be a milestone showing the direction to Highhold pass on
the right of the path. Turn left towards another milestone at this junction
and follow the road to a Large Bridge. When you cross the bridge it will
Zone (Minus 10, Plus 1000) you to North Karanas.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Rivervale Route.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>As you zone into Rivervale follow the path past the guards (and cleric
house on your right) you will see an exit on your left go towards this
and turn right. Follow the path until you see a brown building called fools
gold. Go around the right of this building towards some merchants. You
should then see the Priest of Discord on your left. The Priest is facing
the way you need to go which is the zone to Misty Thicket you will also
see some guards at the zone exit on the left. Behind and to the right of
the Priest is a tower built into the rock face, in there you will find
a bank if you need to use it and a Merchant. When ready Zone to Misty Thicket.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Misty Thicket (from Rivervale Route).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Follow the path at the first junction take a right and then follow
the path to a wall with some guards. The Rivervale side of the wall has
very low level monsters however going through the arch you will be going
into the higher level part of the zone (max of level 14).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>As you go through the arch the path will end. This was where I got
a bit lost the first time I went this way. However stand in the arch facing
away from Rivervale with the wall to your left and right. Then think of
a clock as being straight ahead is 12hrs and behind is 6hrs then go in
the direction of approximately 10hrs or ask a nice halfling to help you,
there are normally some at the arch resting.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>You need to avoid all of the goblin camps and the occasional Orc,
Young Kodak and Goblin Warrior roaming the place as these will all KOS.
When you get to the other side of the zone there will be an entrance into
the wall normally guarded by two goblin warriors (Minus 820, Plus 1640).
If you are not very high a level then you need to either ask someone to
kill them for you or make a run for it as the zone is not far and you should
be able to make it unless you are stunned by one of them.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Runnyeye Castle (from Rivervale Route).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is a dungeon and you need to be careful as there are a few roaming
goblins here. My advice is to get someone to escort you through this place,
as it isn't very far and however if you take a wrong turning you can easily
die by the odd Evil Eye or Dazed Goblin Guard.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>If you cannot find anyone then the route you should take should be
pretty easy. Effectively you turn right at every turning. Walk along the
corridor and turn right you will see a small river in the floor go around
the right of this and turn the next right. Then you will see a Head on
a Stake turn right at this point and then zone to the Gorge of King Xorbb.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Gorge of King Xorbb (Rivervale Route)(Another name is Beholders Maze).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have zoned from Runnyeye you will need to go through the
Gorge of King Xorbb. There are ALOT of high level monsters (level 15+)
here and you really need to be careful. The easiest way is to go up the
left-hand wall as high as you can and follow the wall along the left valley.
When you see some monsters they should not attack you if you are up the
hill (high up) follow the left wall.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>One word of warning, when you follow the left wall you will need
to watch out for two possible occurrences.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>1. Taking some corners too quick. Some of the corners are sharp and
you must not take them too quick or you will fall to the ground. If you
fall you can take about 50hp of damage so be careful if that's all you
have.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2. You will be taken to the ground once along the wall. This will
be obvious if you take the journey slowly. Make sure that no monsters are
down the bottom and quickly walk down. The drop is a gradual one however
if you run with Spirit of Wolf (SOW) or with a Bard's Accelerando playing
you will probably take damage if you don't slow down for this drop. As
soon as you can, go back up the left wall. DO NOT try walking down the
bottom for any more time than necessary.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Then follow the left wall until you get to a junction. This will
be at the point where you cannot follow the left wall anymore. So check
that no monsters are around and walk down to the floor. You must take the
left junction keeping close to the left wall trying to avoid any mudities
or goblins that might be roaming. The zone (Minus 1210, Minus 475) to East
Karanas is down this valley.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>East Karanas (from Rivervale Route).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have zoned follow the valley until the area expands into
grass you will see some huts on your left which are merchant huts and you
can rest there and buy water and muffins if required and is relatively
safe.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>When ready go up the right hand wall as high as you can and follow
the wall to the right avoiding the Bandit camp with Tallus Holton. You
will then come to a river in front of you just after the Druids stones
(teleport site) that was on your left. You must turn left and follow the
shoreline of the river however you must watch the Cyclops in the water
called Broon (Level 28ish) as he will attack you if you get too near to
him, just walk a bit inland around him.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Follow the coast to a wooden bridge and cross the bridge to Zone
(Minus 10, Plus 1000) to North Karanas.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>North Karanas (both Routes have met).</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Come off the bridge and follow the coast to your left (have the water
to your left). This is a big zone and you need to follow the coast all
the way. DO NOT veer off onto the plains, as you will probably die, however
the coast is normally VERY safe so don't worry (but keep your eye out).
You must however watch for a group of human, half elf and Barbarian looking
raiders and are camped at the edge of the shoreline (Approx. Minus 4200,
Minus 2000). Go a bit inland and walk around them, not too far inland though.
Follow the coast PAST a stone bridge (Do not cross the bridge), which is
the bridge to South Karanas, and then continue along the coast until you
zone you West Karanas.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>West Karanas.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>You will need to follow the shoreline all the way in this zone. There
shouldn't be any monsters however avoid any if you see them as they will
probably attack on site but don't worry. You will also see the occasional
Farmer at the water edge however unless you are evil they will be harmless.
Once you have followed the coast until it ends turn right and follow this
wall. You will eventually find an opening into the wall (Minus 10, Minus
1000) that takes you into Qeynos Hills.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Qeynos Hills.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This zone is reasonably safe, however you need to keep your eye out
for Gnolls, Wolves and Grizzly Bears which regularly roam the plains if
your a very low level.</b>
<p><b>Follow the path straight past a Guard Tower on your left and to a
T-Junction. If you want to go to Surefall glades (Druids/Rangers) then
turn right here and follow the path until the end. If you want to go to
Qeynos City then turn left and follow the path until you zone.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Qeynos City.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This Zone around the gates is for newbies.</b>
<p><b>Once you have zoned follow the path straight. You will then get to
Qeynos.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>EVIL Races Route (Good Could go this way)</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>So your an evil Race? Well your journey will be hard unless you can
make yourself invisible. Follow the Good Race Guide going the Highhold
way if you can make yourself invivible however read below for important
information regarding Guards and other NPCs which might attack you.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>N.B. I am inexperienced with travelling as a Evil Race therefore
there may be some mistakes however I will do my best and would take any
suggestions to improve it.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>West Freeport.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is a newbie zone so you should not have a problem with this
zone.</b>
<p><b>Go out of the Gates of Freeport (If you can even enter freeport)
and walk directly away (gates behind you) from the gates towards the zone
to East Commonlands.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>East Commonlands</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>You will need to follow the left wall of the zone. Follow the wall
as high up as you can. You will be walking in a desert. Follow the wall
until you see an opening (Minus 1100, Plus 900) go into this cave and follow
the path. When it starts to open turn right and follow the path you will
then zone to North Ro.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>If you are a Dark Elf you will be probably coming from Nektulous
Forrest. When you have zoned into East Commonlands follow the path until
you get into the open. Then go Exactly straight forward and maybe slightly
to your right however not much (don't follow the path after the area has
opened up). Also watch for any Griffins and any other wildlife. You will
eventually cross a path however you must watch out for a roaming a guard
that sometimes walks down the path. Keep going into the desert and you
should see an opening to a cave on your right (Minus 1100, Plus 900). Go
into this cave and follow the path when it starts to open up into an larger
area turn right and follow the path you will then zone to Northern Desert
of Ro.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Northern Desert of Ro.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have zoned follow the path until you come out into the open.
You will see a tall rock in frount of you. Go around the rock to its left
side and go straight ahead into the desert. Keep going in the same general
direction until you eventually get to the Ocean. When you are travelling
through the desert be carefull of roaming Madmen and Orc Raiders or any
other monsters which lurk in the dunes.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have reached the waters coast follow the coast to your right
(have the water to your left). Keep walking along the coast until you zone
to Oasis of Marr.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Oasis of Marr</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The oasis is a level 20ish zone and can be very hazardous. I have
travelled here many times with my level 8 Troll Shadow Knight on my own
so it can easily be passed without any problems. Before you go you must
be aware that Sand Giants (Level 34+) and Spectres (Level 37+) sometimes
go to the coast however this isn't that common also the crocodiles should
not attack you unless you attack them. Follow the coast again (water on
your left) you will pass a dock and then you will see a small tall rock
in the sea.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Keep following the coast until you start to see the end of the zone.
This is the difficult part of this zone where you must go into the desert
for a little while because of an Orc camp. At Approximatly Minus 1000,
Minus 1300 go out into the desert at a (approx.) 45-degree angle. Keep
going avoiding any nasty monsters that do roam this area. I would advice
trying to get Sprit of Wolf (SOW) from one of the players you will see
at the coast, as this can be a lifesaver. Also the zone is quite big and
is between two rocks. The zone will at Plus 10, Minus 1900 and you will
zone to Southern Desert of Ro.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Southern Desert of Ro.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This zone is very difficult to explain where to go. Effectively as
you zone in you want to go towards the right of the Zone. However and a
big However. On the far right of the zone there are Dervish and Orc camps
which you MUST avoid. So run to the right of the zone keeping away from
any camps which you see. This is probably the most risky part of the trip
so take your time. You will also find that you will be initially walking
in the desert and then eventually get to the grassy part of the zone.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>You are aiming for the Innothule Swamp zone which is at Minus 3192,
Plus 1139 once you get there zone.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Innothule Swamp.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is a very dark place however you shouldn't have any problems
in seeing because you should have infravision. As you zone in follow the
path until you meet the waters edge. If you want to go to Grobb (Troll
City) or GUK then take a left here and follow the edge of the zone. The
first entrance you come to which is guarded by who Frogloks is the GUK
entrance. If you continue past this following the edge of the zone you
will see about three troll NPCs this is the zone to Grobb. If you do not
intend on going to Grobb or Guk then turn right and follow the edge of
the zone (have water to your left). You will be looking for an opening
in the side of the zone which will be the first opening you come to...you
will then zone to Ferrott.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Ferrott</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This is inhabited by Lizards and should be relatively safe if you
dont stray. Follow the path taking the first right that you come to. Continue
to follow the path and you will come to another junction which you should
take a left. You will then walk though the zone for a little while and
eventually see another fork in the road this time you should take a left.
You will pass some ogres on your left and then come to a T-Junction. If
you want to go to Oggok turn right here otherwise turn left. You will then
cross a bridge over a river. Keep following the path taking a right at
the next turning. You will then eventually get to Rathe Mountains zone.
NB: If you are a good race then you have to be invisible in this zone because
of Ogre Bouncers. They will attack ALL good races and will probably kill
you in one hit you have been warned.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>As a side note...If you have intentions on going to Cazic Thule then
when you zone in from Innothule swamp. Follow the path until you get into
the open turn left and follow the left wall (mind the bard there not sure
if he attacks Evil people) until you come to a river. Swim directly across
the river to the other side. Then follow the edge of the building until
you see a large ramp in front of you. Go around to your right and then
go up the ramp. In the middle of this large ramp you will find a small
opening which is the zone to Cazic Thule. A word of warning Cazic Thule
is a level 20+ zone DO NOT go in there if you are any lower because you
will almost defiantly die if you do.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Rathe Mountains</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Not many people know their way though this zone however it is very
easy to navigate. As you zone in from Ferrott the zone will start to open
up. You will be presented with three choices in directions to go. DO NOT
turn left or Right or even explore down there unless you are of a very
high level (level 40ish). Go straight on and follow the path, you will
eventually see a left hand turning which you need to ignore and instead
veer to your right. You will then come to an area where I am unsure how
the monsters here react to Evil Races. There will be some Giant Scarab
named monsters here. Make sure that you con them before you attempt to
go past in case they attack you, however I know that that they con indifferently
to my Wood Elf Bard and will not attack him. Follow the path to the right
and you will then be taken into an open area of the zone. There will be
some Inns on the left side of the zone. You need to follow the left side
of the zone (same side as the Inns). However keep away from these Inns
because the merchants can be hostile even too good races. Follow the left
side of the zone until you find an opening on the left into another area.
Then follow the right side of this new area. Keep following the right side
until you see an opening on your right and then follow down there to zone
to Lake Rathe.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Lake Rathe</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>I hope your swimming is good or it will get better. As you zone in
you will walk the edge of the water and you should see a pier. Also watch
out for a named Froglok which sometimes roams this area. He is very high
level and will defiantly attack you if your an evil race. Turn right and
follow the edge of the water you may need to swim at parts so be prepared.
Follow the right side of the zone. You will then see a camp on the top
of a hill that is a bandit camp, keep away from this and follow the right
edge of the water (water to your left). Now take the journey slowly at
this point because there is an Orc camp on the edge of the water which
can be nasty. When you see the Orc camp swim into the lake around the Orc
camp and then get back on the edge of the zone when you can. Give yourself
a nice wide berth around the camp as they will see you in the water if
you get too close. Follow the edge of the lake again passing another place
with a empty house and then you will come to an area with another pier.
Be careful here because after 6pm Norraith time (use /time command) Dry
Bone Skeletons and Zombies spawn and are lethal unless your level is in
the 20s. Also watch the Gnolls during the day which are of a lower level
but will attack you on site. You need to turn right here and I advise going
up the banks around the edge of the camp which will mean you will pass
without any problems. You will then zone to South Karanas (Plus 4352, Plus
1147) after following the path.</b>

<p><b>There are lots of ways to travel though this zone. However to make
it simple follow the edge of the zone although it is a little longer. The
quickest way is to go straight ahead into the zone and never turn and head
due North, however this can take you past some nasty monsters which might
kill you. Once you have zoned from Lake Rathe follow the path until the
area opens up. Then take a left and follow the edge of the Zone. Keep following
the edge if the zone you will be force to turn right do this and keep following
the left side of the zone. After a long time following the edge of the
zone you eventually meet some water. Turn right and follow the edge of
the river (water on your left). You will eventually come to a stone bridge
crossing the water which you need to cross to North Karanas (Plus 2889,
Plus 907).</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>North Karanas.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>IMPORTANT: You will need to jump off the left side bridge before
the tower because there are guards there and they will attack you. Swim
away from the tower to the edge of the water. Then Follow the coast to
your left (have the water to your left) continue along the coast until
you zone you West Karanas. If the guards see you then zone back to South
Karanas, which can be done in the water if needed.</b>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>You will need to follow the shoreline all the way in this zone. There
shouldn't be any monsters however avoid any if you see them as they will
probably attack on site but don't worry. You will also see the occasional
Farmer and Barbarian Camp at the water edge which you will need to avoid
because they will probably attack you. Once you have followed the coast
until it ends turn right and follow this wall. You will eventually find
an opening into the wall (Minus 10, Minus 1000) that takes you into Qeynos
Hills.</b>

<p><b>Qeynos Hills.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Once you have zoned in walk along the path until it opens. Be aware
that a guard walks along this path regularly and will probably attack you
if he sees you. When the zone opens up turn left and follow the edge of
the zone until you zone to Qeynos City.</b>

<p><b>Qeynos City.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>This Zone around the gates is for newbies.</b>
<p><b>Once you have zoned you will need to be careful of any Guards. You
can get bound at the zone point if you need to. Also if you follow the
left side of the wall you will eventually see part of the wall look like
Vines on it. This is the secret entrance to the Qeynos sewers that also
has a Necromancer guild.</b>
