<p><a NAME="Clurg's Revenge"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Clurg's Revenge:</font>&nbsp;
Clurg the bartender doesn't like that someone in Neriak is imitating his
drinks, and wants you to deal with him.&nbsp; Bring him the head of this
imposter and you will get rewarded.&nbsp; The head you get from completing
the Freeport Exotic Drink quest works here, but that's not the one you
are really supposed to get.&nbsp; He is referring to a female ogre bartender
named Pugla in the Ogre area in the Foreign Quarter of Neriak.&nbsp; She
is located in the large building containing a small PvP arena with a mixture
of troll and ogre NPCs inside.&nbsp;&nbsp; She gets scared if you ask her
about the Flaming Clurg.&nbsp; Be careful with her since she hits harder
than her level would indicate.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by Kiggulak)</b>
<p><a NAME="Exotic Drinks (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Exotic Drinks:</font>&nbsp;
This quest is probably the best quest in the game for a lower level magic
user, especially an enchanter.&nbsp; In fact, with the new changes, only
an enchanter (or perhaps a very careful dark elf) can really do the whole
thing.&nbsp; It results in the Stein of Moggok, a great magic item which
gives +10 int, +5 dex, +10 hp, +25 disease resistance, has two charges
of healing and acts as a greater light source.&nbsp; The items can be collected
by just about anyone, but you need to to be an enchanter to finish the
quest.&nbsp; I know the quest works every time with a level 20 enchanter
who has illusion ogre and benevolence.&nbsp; It also can work in some instances
with a level 12 enchanter who has illusion dark elf and alliance.&nbsp;
It is a lengthy quest, requiring you to go all over the world to get items,
but worth it.&nbsp; Clurg, the Ogre bartender in Ogguk, has lost his bartender's
compendium and wants it back badly.&nbsp; It is currently held by Bartender
Gregor, in Freeport.&nbsp; Fortunately, Gregor has a lust for exotic drinks,
and lacks only the ingredients to make his dream concoctions.&nbsp; He
will give you the compendium for those ingredients.&nbsp; He wants you
to get him the following items:&nbsp; (1) a Kiola Nut, which can be purchased
on the island of Erollisi for about 2 gp, (2) Erud's Tonic [now a no drop
lore item] (see Erudin quests, basically a quick purchase and exchange),
(3) Honey Jum from Rivervale (See Rivervale Quests - the price is now 3
platinum) [note:&nbsp; You need an indifferent faction in Rivervale for
this one or you need to trust a halfling to get it for you.&nbsp; If you
can't find a trustworthy halfling, (I had the misfortune of initially getting
ripped off by a particularly nasty halfling named Mappas who believed he
could extort 5 pp for the honey jum after I gave him the items and a promise
of 5 gp to get it [back when it only cost 5 gp for the item]) you can easily
create one of your own and do the exchange since a level 1 can easily do
this part of the quest], and (4) a Koalindl Fish from the lake in the Temple
of Life in Qeynos [now a no drop lore item].&nbsp; This is the hardest
and most costly part of the quest.&nbsp; You will take a severe faction
hit with several good factions and with Rodcet Nife himself for killing
the fish, dropping several levels in faction, and you will get attacked
and killed when you leave the water unless you gate in time.&nbsp; (There
is also a paladin who will jump in and kill you in the water if he is nearby).&nbsp;
The fish do not drop a corpse every time, so you may have to kill several
fish, potentially making you kos with many clerics afterwards.&nbsp; Also,
they are a slow spawn and are currently being camped quite a bit.&nbsp;
I don't know if this will work, but it might be possible for two people
to do this with one creating a mule to kill the fish and take the faction
hit, while the enchanter who will complete the quests loots it and gets
the item.&nbsp;&nbsp; As another alternative, Frostbite the Dog in WK sometimes
drops a Koalindl fish if his master is not around, but you lose some serious
faction for this as well and one of the people you lose faction with happens
to spend a lot of time in Gregor's bar, making it tough to complete the
quest if you become kos with her.&nbsp; Although the resulting drink sounds
pretty foul to me, should you manage to gather all of these ingredients
he promises to give you his bartender's compendium.&nbsp; The enchanter
must give Gregor the ingredients.&nbsp; IMPORTANT.&nbsp; You must now give
them to him one at a time, or he will send you back to collect the other
three all over again!&nbsp; Gregor will then give him 3 to 4 pp and the
bartender's compendium, which is a no drop item.&nbsp; This has to be taken
to Ogguk and given to Clurg the bartender there.&nbsp; Be aware that even
under an illusion some ogres might attack you, so it might help to go invisible.&nbsp;
Before giving it to Clurg, the enchanter needs to cast illusion ogre and
benevolence.&nbsp; Or as an alternative, cast illusion dark elf and alliance
(this lets it be done by a lower level enchanter, but does not seem to
work every time).&nbsp; If his or her faction is not good enough, it won't
work (I have had reports that indifferent has worked for some people and
not worked for others, but that is probably the minimum he should con).&nbsp;
Clurg will then give you the stein.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would say, assuming you
can get sow when needed, you can do this quest in just about 3 hours (less
if you have teleports).</b>

by the Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat
called "HEHE meat" and the recipe to make it.&nbsp; You can purchase the
meat in Oggok from Dooga the Ogre Chef.&nbsp; (He has a seperate quest
to deliver froglock legs).&nbsp;&nbsp; He will send you to deliver a Grub
Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik.&nbsp;
Nerbilik is fishing on the Siren rocks.&nbsp; Be careful, since I have
been told the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent.&nbsp;
Give him the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased
faction with DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and
some xp.&nbsp; However, he will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so
you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse.&nbsp; Then take the recipe
and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for
you efforts.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ashrum)</b>

Keep near the entrance to Oggok and speak with a froglock named Glib and
tell him that the Greenblood Shaman sent you.&nbsp; After speaking to Marda,
you must run immediately to Prakk's tower to speak with Glib, the secret
froglok emmisary to Oggok.&nbsp; Glib will be waiting for you on the top
floor of the tower.&nbsp; If you stop to buy things or talk with an NPC,
Glib will disappear.&nbsp; Glib will ask you to kill the Troll Slayer in
Innothule Swamp and return with the Slayer's silver neclace.&nbsp; After
slaying the Troll Slayer, Glib wants you to slay a Slayer Captain. After
slaying the Captain, Glib mentions the froglock prisoner in Grobb. The
froglock is named "a prisoner" and is located near the gem vendor in Grobb.&nbsp;
Tell the prisoner, "Glib sent me", and he will tell you he doesn't believe
you and to prove you are legit, he wants the necklace of a Troll basher
(intestine necklace +5hp). Upon returning the necklace, he will give you
an empty jar to be taken to Froger Grikk in the swamp. Take the jar to
Grikk and he will give a item to be taken back to the prisoner (I forget
the item). The prisoner will then give you a note to be take back to Marda.
This note explains how Zimbittle (female NPC in swamp) is teaching the
Lizardman Mystic to fight Ogres. Marda then insist you kill Zimbittle and
return with her pouch as proof. After returning the pouch you are rewarded
2 first level shaman spells.&nbsp; Big whoop. (Submitted by Doriath and
