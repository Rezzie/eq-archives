In the Library at the 3rd gate is a scribe naked Lokar T'Biath.&nbsp; If
you give him a bottle of red wine he will give you some exp and it will
improve your faction with the Dread Guards Outer/Inner and the Dark Bargainers.&nbsp;
He will then tell you he mentions his sister and her vow.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you ask Lokar T'Biath about his sister's vow..."What vow?" He says a 70&nbsp;
gold tithe to Innourok may help. He then gives you the note to his sister
, who is disguised as a female barkeep in the Blind Fish Tavern.&nbsp;
When you find her, you can ask her about being a scribe of dal and about
the book of turmoil. Give her the note from her brother and she gives you
a note written in Tier'Dal, the note says that she will give you the book
if you return to her the head of her brother, because he has betrayed her
secret, and the note.&nbsp; Go back and kill him and take his head and
the note back to the barkeep.&nbsp; (You will also sometimes get a bloody
robe, and AC 2 no drop lore item, but I'm not sure what to do with that).&nbsp;
She will give you the book of turmoil.&nbsp; This in turn can be given
to the Oracle in the Ocean of Tears as part of the <a href="Q_OTears.htm#Tome of Ages">Tome

the second floor of the Seafarers in the morning, however Dark elves are
KOS if they enter the bar (with the new ability to move and stay hidden
perhaps the thieves can now complete this one...) In any case an easier
way to kill her is to hire someone to go upstairs and tell her that a ship
has docked. She will come outside to the pier where she can be killed.

them for him.&nbsp; If you choose to help, he will give you a box which
you need to fill with 10 eyes and combine.&nbsp; You then need to give
him the box and the tusk together.&nbsp; Mammoths are found way over in
Everfrost and the Kerran Beetle Eyes are found in Erud's Crossing, so you
will have to do some hiking to get him his stuff.&nbsp; You will get some
experience and a small reward.&nbsp; However, since the mammoth tusk alone

Thicket in the Halfling territory just outside of town.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
she rooms with her big brother Joogl Honeybugger who never seems to leave
her side, and he is probably around level 10 or so.&nbsp; Since you need
to be below this level to get the quest, you had better get some help in
killing her.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you kill Lil, she drops a halfling head (which
is what you're supposed to bring back to Paziu Puno for your "kings reward"),
a bandage (so you can reverse the faction hit you take from killing Lil
by giving it to Joogl later), and a Case of Jum Jum Juice (lore item)(which
I guess you can give to the treant).&nbsp; Here's where this quest gets
funny.&nbsp; After sneaking/hiding through Rivervale and making the run
back to Neriak, you need to give the halfling head to Paziu Puno.&nbsp;
He then tells you something to the effect of "Foolish young elf. This was
no contract from King Naythox.&nbsp; I wanted Lil Honeybugger killed before
she gave birth to my child.&nbsp; Only a naive dark elf would set foot
in Halfling territory.&nbsp; Here's your great reward, garbage from other
guild exploits."&nbsp; You get some exp,&nbsp; a few cp, a minor item,

the 3 pieces come from 2 different sources. The mallet head and hilt come
from Killing Elf skeletons.&nbsp; The stem comes from killing Commander
Windstream in level 3 of befallen, and he is a level 20+ Zombie.&nbsp;

have to fight this NPC to complete Quest #2. Note that Yegek says you must
do it unarmed, but I'm not sure if you actually have to or not, or what
you get if you defeat him.&nbsp; The REASON I'm not sure is that that Teir'Dal

I tried 9 more times (dying to get that sword back was noooooo problem),
armed and unarmed, and never put a mark on him. At 5th, my final try, H2H

one single scratch on him for 1 point. Whoopee. Meanwhile he was hammering
me for around 6 per punch and hitting a *lot more often than I was.&nbsp;
Maybe with H2H maxed, if you wait until 6th or so, it's easier, but you'll
only get one try, since by then your starting sword won't reappear when
