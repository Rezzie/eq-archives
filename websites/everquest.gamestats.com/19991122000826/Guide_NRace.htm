<br><b><font size=+2>Picking the race that's best for you -</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+2>Necromancers.</font></b></center>

<p><b>This is a short little bit of information I gathered on necromancers.&nbsp;
Some from my own experience; some from other sites; some from veterans
of EQ.</b>
<p><b>If you're like me, then you've probably played a few different race/class
combinations before finding one you truly like, and if your really like
me then you've probably tried almost everything out. If not, then good
job.&nbsp; You're way ahead of me in making your own personal ultimate
character. From the first, I thought necros were really really cool, and
if you need to know why you need not read this guide.&nbsp; Go to the necromancer's
hideout and find out for yourself. Anyway the class really appealed to
me, but the guides to choosing your race either really SUCK or are non-existent.&nbsp;
So without further ado here are the pros and cons of each race.</b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Dark elf:</font> The race almost everyone plays when
they want to become a necromancer</b>
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<br><b>1. Yours is the only race that embraces the necromancers. You'll
feel right at home in Neriak.</b>
<br><b>2. You have Ultravision. You can see almost perfectly in darkness.</b>
<br><b>3. You have high base stats.</b>
<br><b>4. You can hunt without being KOS in evil zones, like innothule
swamp, which is where you'll want to go as soon as you can make it through
Freeport alive.</b>
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<br><b>1. The city itself is HUGE! Three zones wide in fact. You'll be
trekking alot back in forth between the newbie hunting zone and the necro
guild way at the back of the 3rd gate, which is also the third zone to
get through.&nbsp; Also you have to zone at least once to find merchants
to sell to you, which is something I personally I cant stand.</b>
<br><b>2. The newbie hunting grounds are the WORST I've seen in all the
newbie hunting grounds I've fought in (including qeynos, freeport, kelethin-felwithe,
erudin, and grobb) for a couple of reasons. One being that the entire zone
is very foggy and even if you've got ultravision it doesnt help much. Its
very very easy to get lost in this zone as there aren't many landmarks
and mostly everything looks the same. The second is more of a byproduct
of the first.&nbsp; There are many more high level creatures running around
in nektolus forest than in other newbie zones and getting lost means you'll
run into them some of the time, and it also means you wont be able to find
the guards quick enough for you to escape.&nbsp; So for this reason get
locate corpse as soon as possible if you start as a dark elf, but have
fun going the 3 miles to the necro guild to get it.</b>
<br><b>3. You are evil if you haven't noticed.&nbsp; Good luck going anywhere
near good zones without invisiblity, which means that you will either be
KOS in all good zones or just not sold to.&nbsp; It also means you have
to spend a while in the horrid nektolus forest.</b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Erudite:</font> The smart guys</b>
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<br><b>1. You have the highest base intelligence of the classes eligible
to be necros.</b>
<br><b>2. The newbie hunting grounds are as foggy as nektulos.&nbsp; However
you can do all your buying and selling at the necros guild situated outside
of Erudin without having to zone.</b>
<br><b>3. You're good.&nbsp; That means that the majority of the good races
will deal with you.</b>
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<br><b>1. You are blind as a bat in the dark, if you dont exploit the gamma.</b>
<br><b>2. There is a somewhat confusing newbie zone, and since its as foggy
as nektulos and you dont have infravision or ultravision, you may find
yourself getting lost.</b>
<br><b>3. There are not nearly as many erudites as other races, so be ready
to be a very lonely erudite.</b>
<br><b>4. Erudin isolated from other cities, so this adds to the loneliness.</b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Gnome:</font> The short guys</b>
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<br><b>1. You have high intelligence</b>
<br><b>2. You start near some of the best hunting on Faydwer, and it is
not too hard to get to Kelethin.</b>
<br><b>3. You get tinkering (if you swing on that side)</b>
<br><b>4. You are also good, so you wont get KOS as much.</b>
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<br><b>1. There is hardly ANY necro guild in your hometown.&nbsp; Good
luck finding anyone to sell to you for a good price.</b>
<br><b>2. You are short :-)</b>
<p><b><font size=+1>Human:</font> My personal favorite</b>
<p><b>Pros:</b>
<br><b>1. You can start out in Freeport or Qeynos, which are, in my opinion,
the two best cities to start in,&nbsp; You also won't have to zone to sell
goods in the first couple of levels.</b>
<br><b>2. You are also good, so more people will sell to you and less will
KOS you.</b>
<br><b>3. You look badass in a red necro robe.</b>
<br><b>4. You have more balanced stats.</b>
<br><b>5. You gain levels faster.</b>
<p><b>Cons:</b>
<br><b>1. See erudite about being blind as a bat.</b>
<br><b>2. You have the lowest base intelligence of any race eligible to
be necros.&nbsp; (Gonna need to pump those stats up with intel increasing
items)</b>
