Grimlot's Love:</font>&nbsp; This quest no longer results in the Electrum-Bladed
Wakizashi.&nbsp; I am not sure what if anything you get for this.&nbsp;
Lord Grimlot tells you about his poor, misguided beloved Arlena, who has
run away from him to Mistmoore castle.&nbsp; Being the sentimental type,
he wants you to track down the lass, kill her and return her either the
lute of the gypsy or her bones.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Vampire Teeth"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Vampire
Teeth:</font>&nbsp; This is the current quest for the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Electrum_Bladed_Wakizashi.html">Electrum-Bladed
Wakazashi</a></font>.&nbsp; It is not easy to complete. The Avenging Catliff
is a non-aggressive npc.&nbsp; You don't need any faction.&nbsp; You can
kill him 1000 times he will be non agrro. You hail him and he glares his
fangs with a electrum bladed wakizashi. You ask him about the wakizashi
and he tells you he is looking for his mother and father.&nbsp; You ask
him "Who is you mother?" and "Who is your father?" and he tells you Maid
Issis and Butler Syncall are captives in Castle Mistmoore and he wants
you to free their souls by killing them. He will reward you if you bring
back their fangs to show him that you freed their souls.&nbsp; Maid Issis
and the Butler Sincall are located fairly deep within Mistmoore.&nbsp;
The teeth are very rare drops (roughly 5% - and these two particular NPC's
are usually camped as well).&nbsp; Anyway, if you're lucky enough to obtain
the teeth (both of them), you simply give them to Avenging Catliff (who
spawns behind the graveyard).&nbsp; He will give you the EBW.&nbsp; And
since Avenging Catliff also drops some nice stuff, he's usually camped
24 / 7 as well (he gets to breathe Norrath air for about 3 seconds before
the spells and swords start raining in).</b>
