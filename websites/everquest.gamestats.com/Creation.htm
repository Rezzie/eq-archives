<blockquote><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i><font color="#FF0000">General
Information</font></i> - Before creating a character, look at the information
on race, class and statistics, read the linked guides and check out the
fighting strategies of the various classes to decide what you think you
will enjoy playing the most.&nbsp; Match your character to your personality,
(or vice versa).&nbsp; Keep in mind that all characters play much the same
for the first few levels.&nbsp; Though I haven't gotten that high, there
are those who say that you can't get a true feel for a class before level
15 or 20.&nbsp; I would say it is at least level 7 to 10 before you start
to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your class.&nbsp; Since it
can take 60 or 70 hours to just get a character to level 8, I would suggest
you start out with something you really feel will be fun to play.&nbsp;
I hope this guide can help you save some of your precious playing time
by steering you to the character which suits you best.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#FF0000">Choosing a Server</font></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For the most part the choice of a server is not crucial, since it doesn't
really affect lag like in some other games.&nbsp; There are some factors
you should consider, however.&nbsp; First is whether you wish to player
kill (PK).&nbsp; If you are really into this, you should probably choose
the pvp (player versus player) server.&nbsp; While you can chose pvp on
any server, probably 95% of the other players will be non pvp.&nbsp; Another
factor to consider on choosing a server is that many of the poeple who
beta tested the game seem to have gone back to their beta server and recreated
their characters.&nbsp; If you choose one of these servers (Fennin Ro,
Xegony, The Rathe and Tarew Marr) be aware that many if not most of the
players will be experienced players who already have learned many of the
tricks of the game.&nbsp; You may like this idea, since they can help you
out and show you the ropes, or dislike it, since it will put a true newbie
at a disadvantage.&nbsp; I am just offering it for your consideration.&nbsp;
Also, the more crowded the server the more competition for kills.&nbsp;
All other things being equal, I would suggest that your number one reason
to pick a server be how many people are on it.</b>
<p><a NAME="Race"></a><b><i><font face="Kaufmann Bd BT"><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Race

<p><a NAME="Statistics"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font face="Kaufmann Bd BT"><font size=+2>Stats</font></font><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></i>
You chose your character's stats when you create it, and have to live with
the decision thereafter.&nbsp; There is no one perfect way to set up an
individual character class.&nbsp; Much of it depends on your playing style,
your preferences and the decision you make as to how you want your character
to make his or her&nbsp; way through the world.&nbsp; Below are the basic
descriptions of how the stats affect the characters.</b>
<blockquote>
<center><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Strength</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This is not the be all end all stat for fighters it is in many other
RPG’s, but is still very important.&nbsp; Strength affects your maximum
damage cap,&nbsp; how often you do maximum damage, and more importantly
how much stuff you can carry.&nbsp; If you plan on wearing heavy armor
and carrying around a lot of extra equipment, you will need decent strength.&nbsp;
The biggest advantage of a high strength that I can see is the ability
to carry more loot.&nbsp; If you plan on soloing, you may want to put extra
points into strength, even if you are a magic user.&nbsp; It is definitely
important for a fighter type to have good strength, but you will regret
it if you ignore the other stats in favor of strength.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Stamina</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>One of the most important stats for all classes.&nbsp; The higher
your stamina, the more hit points you get at each level.&nbsp; Over time,
this can really pay off.&nbsp; It also affects some resistances, and I
believe it affects how quickly you shrug off poison and disease, but have
not verified this.&nbsp; It also affects how quickly you lose stamina in
a fight or when running away, which can be a blessing when you need one
more jump to get you to safety.&nbsp; Magic user classes should not ignore
the benefits of stamina, especially if you plan on soloing.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Dexterity</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This determines how often you hit or miss a monster with your attack.&nbsp;
It also affects a Bard's playing ability.&nbsp; More importantly, it is
used to determine your starting armor class.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think
it affects spells, only physical attacks.&nbsp; Good to have for fighters,
and relatively useless for magic users.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Agility</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>This determines how often you get hit or missed by an attack, and
helps determine your starting armor class.&nbsp; Since you will take less
damage and have a better chance of not having your spells disrupted if
you have a higher amount of agility, this is useful for both fighters and
magic users.&nbsp; However, for magic users, its usefulness diminishes
as you go up in levels and spend less time in actual melee.&nbsp; I wouldn't
bother with this stat too much for a magic user who plans on grouping most
of the time, but a solo magic user should probably have a high agility.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Intelligence</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>For Wizards, Magicians, Necromancers and Shadow Knights, the higher
your intelligence, the more mana you get for each level.&nbsp; This is
obviously very important since without mana a magic user is basically worthless.&nbsp;
It apparantly has some effect on resistance to mind based spells, and affects
how quickly all classes learn skills.&nbsp; This effect is fairly insignificant
since you tend to max your skills pretty quickly anyway.&nbsp; Basically,
if you aren't one of the four non-deity magic classes, this stat is relatively
useless.&nbsp; Many would suggest that a magic user put all of his points
here.&nbsp; Certainly, if you plan on spending most of your time in a group,
intelligence is the most important stat to boost.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Wisdom</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The same effect as intelligence for the deity-based magic users:&nbsp;
Cleric, Shaman Druid, Paladin and Ranger.&nbsp; The higher your wisdom,
the more mana you get for each level.&nbsp; Also affects your resistance
to mind based attacks such as charm.&nbsp; Very important for the deity-based
magic users, but much less important for everyone else.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Charisma</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>The biggest effect of charisma is in the amount you will get buying
from and selling to NPC’s.&nbsp; If they like you, they give you a better
deal, which is not to be ignored in the cash starved world of Norrath.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, you may be better off putting points in strength so that
you can carry more stuff to sell and get the attack bonuses as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Charisma also affects the success of charm spells, which is notable for
such classes as enchanter, druid and bard.</b>

<a NAME="Deity"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Deity</font></font></i></b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The choice of deity affects how NPC’s will view
you.&nbsp; In general good citizens like people who worship good gods,
and vice versa.&nbsp; This factors into the prices you pay at the stores,
the quests you are given, and the willingness of guards to come to your
rescue.&nbsp; When choosing a god, think how it will affect your role playing.&nbsp;
Certain class/deity combinations are killed on sight in some towns.&nbsp;
A rogue who worships the goddess of love will probably face ridicule at
the local thieves guild and have a hard time convincing someone to train
him. On the other hand, a wizard who worships chaos will probably find
few friends in the more civilized cities.&nbsp; This is not an unimportant
choice.&nbsp; For more information, check out:</b>

<a NAME="Name"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Name</font></font></i>-
Pick a name that is easy to read, spell and remember. Here's why.&nbsp;
First, especially at lower levels, each member of a particular race looks
a lot alike, except that hovering above everyone's head is their name for
all to see.&nbsp; This is your chance to distinguish yourself.&nbsp; Second,
you meet with people, group together and disband a lot during the game.&nbsp;
Assuming you were a good group member, you want everyone to remember you
so that they will group with you again.&nbsp; It is best to have a memorable
and unique name that will stick in the memory of other players.&nbsp; Finally,
the game requires a lot of personal messages where the person has to type
in your name to talk to you.&nbsp; Oddball spellings are just annoying
when trying to find and talk to someone.&nbsp; Take your time and think
up a good name that fits your character.&nbsp; Your name can never be changed.</b>
<p><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>Background</font></font></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can fill in a biography on your character by right clicking on his
picture (or /coning yourself).&nbsp; When others examine you they will
be able to read your biography.&nbsp; This is a good time to start to role
play your character.&nbsp; Think of some basic information that will help
you define your character's personality, and put it in.&nbsp; Is he going
to be Good? Evil? Selfish? Uptight? Stingy? Generous? Helpful?&nbsp; Adding
a personality to your character will really help you get into the game,
and it doesn't have to be your real personality.&nbsp; I would add that
if you plan to play an evil selfish player, be prepared to have difficulty
grouping.&nbsp; The servers are small enough that reputations are earned
and spread among the other players.</b></blockquote>
