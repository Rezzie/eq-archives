Breastplate:</font>&nbsp; If you talk to the guildmaster of the deepwater
knights in Erudin, he will talk about some deepwater tasks, then on to
a diseased shark. The Guildmaster asks for you to kill a diseased shark
that is endangering the life of the ocean, fill the bag with the sharks
remains, and the remains of 3 of its young. If you go to the docks, and
kill the diseased shark, you will get shark items, plus some shark skin
that is a lore item. The Diseased Shark is about level 10. Save the shark
skin lore item, and kill the young baby sharks that spawned. Each young
shark has a baby shark remains no drop lore item, which you need for the
quest. Place the diseased shark skin lore item, and three of the remains
(seperately in the last 3 slots of the bag), and combine. The bag becomes
a no drop lore item, which you return to the guildmaster and recieve a
BLUE chestplate. The chestplate is only 8ac and sv 3 heat and cold resistances.
However, it looks very spiffy, and is great for parties, gatherings, and
weddings =) It's a darker blue than crafted armor too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Supposedly,
if you are a high enough level and have good enough faction, he will then
give you the quest which results in the Deepwater harpoon. (Submmitted

the sewers.&nbsp; In the sewers, there is a fisherman near the "main open

and he will tell you that he is willing to go back to worshipping the God
of Prexus if you will give him your guild tunic (I assume you must still
have your guild tunic to fulfill this quest).&nbsp; Give him the tunic

Tox Forest.&nbsp; It may be that any of the heritics will sometimes drop

He will say, " Well done my young apprentice. I call you apprentice, fore
you are nothing but a spark to my fire. This is the final component for
my greatest creation... AHA!! I call it.. Iced Tea!! Never again shall
I boil under the hot sun. As for you, take this. It should serve you well.
Now go away. There is no Iced Tea for you."&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get a

Ilanic to test his new spell icecapades, which others call column of frost,

scroll can be found on a Kobald caster in Tox forest, which is a pretty
rare spawn.&nbsp; For completing the quest you will get: The spell Column

On the third floor of the castle, Toresian Fhabel is waiting for someone
to take an inert potion down to Vials of Vitality, on the first floor of
the castle.&nbsp; There are two people who you can give the potion to.&nbsp;
The first time you run the quest, the correct person (with a single name,
not a surname) 'spawns' in the shop and if you hand the bottle to him,
the factions are gained with craftkeepers/council/guards of Erudin and
lost with the Heretics. If you run this quest a second time immediately
following the first, then "A Gate Bandit" will spawn in place of the person
you are supposed to give the bottle to.&nbsp; If you hand the bottle to
the bandit, then your factions with Corrupt Qeynos Guards, Heretics, and
others will go up and good factions will go down. This bandit is about
L10 or 11, and it is possible that killing him starts a new quest by talking
to one of the NPC's in the shop.</b>

with the paws of her enemies.&nbsp; Go kill Kobald Shamen in Tox forest
and return with three paws and you will be rewarded.&nbsp; This quest will
not be given after level 12.</b>
<p><a NAME="Library Book (E)"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Library
Book:</font>&nbsp; If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of
the temple of divine light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book
from the library. This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The librarian tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top
floor knows the person who last checked it out.&nbsp; When you ask him,
he tells you that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro
Finharn and that he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.&nbsp;
He tells you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.&nbsp;
Once there, she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk
to her.&nbsp; When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still
alive.&nbsp; Her brother is at Crows&nbsp; (It seems he is sick and is
in need of some Erud's Tonic.&nbsp; This is a side quest).&nbsp; Ask him
about The Testament of Vanear.&nbsp; He says yes he has it and will sell
it to me for 2 gold.&nbsp; If you give him the 2 gold he gives you the
book which has to inventory slots and a combine button in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He then laughs and tells you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34 and the
book is worthless without them.&nbsp; He also says that the thief sold
the pages to someone named Ran.&nbsp; If you then ask him who Ran is he
tells you that Ran Flamespinner is a librarian in Highpass.&nbsp; If you
go to Highpass and ask about The Testament of Vanear he tells you that
he did indeed buy page 30 from a man named Moodoro some time ago but that
it was recently stolen by a man wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and
that this guard was still in Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also
says that Moodoro also had page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you
go into highhold pass and go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or
pond or whatever. Jump in and swim around until you come to a hidden camp
of smugglers. Only one npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starsine.
Kill him and you get page 30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is
for the Muffin for Panos Quest in Freeport).&nbsp; Beware that any smugglers
around him will come to his aid.&nbsp; Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt
Qeynos Guard, +Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands,
-BloodSabers)&nbsp; The faction hits for him are pretty lagre, so be aware
after that of potentially slipping to KOS in Qeynos.&nbsp; After going
back to Qeynos, I went back to Moodoro and said I want page 34.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said ahh so you figured out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip
out the most valuable page and that it doesn't matter if I get it because
the work is fiction anyway.&nbsp; He then offers to play a game with you
for the page. For 4 gold he will deal you one card and if that one card
is a jester he will give you the page.&nbsp; Along with the jester, you
might also draw the King, Queen, Beggar, or Knight.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Note -
keep the Knights and give them to the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].&nbsp;
Once the whole thing is combined you get the <a href="../equipment/graphics/Testament_of_Vanear.htm">Testament
of Vanear</a>, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop
lore item.&nbsp; You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In the harbor there is a place where you can at times find 2 Odus Pearls
under 2 Sand Sharks fairly close togethor (on a side note sometimes there
will be NPC's seen swimming here who I believe also collect the pearls,
if you kill one of these NPC's they say the Circle of Unseen Hands will
get revenge your faction with the Qeynos Guards goes up faction with corrupt
guards and the circle of the unseen hands go down I also think faction
with Qeynos merchants went down)...&nbsp; You want to get both of these
because in order to get the treant chips you need to talk to a man in the
upstairs of the cobbler shop in North Qeynos... he says he will give you
some treant chips if you do a favor for him... the favor is to get him
an Odus Pearl give him a pearl and he will give you the treant chips you
need to get the treant resin made.Once you combine an odus pearl (from
the harbor) with the resin, you get a peacekeeper staff (Damage 4/Speed
30--weapon for clerics and paladins).&nbsp; If you return the staff to
the cleric, he will give you faction, xp, a random item and an additional
quest, or&nbsp; you can keep the staff.&nbsp; This quest will not be given

<p><a NAME="Vasty Deep Water"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Vasty Deep Water:</font>&nbsp;
If you go talk to one of the Paladins on the top floor of the temple of

This starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest. The librarian
tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows
the person who last checked it out.&nbsp; When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is names Modorro and that he was
executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.&nbsp; He tells you to
go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.&nbsp; Once there, she
says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.&nbsp; When
you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.&nbsp; She'll
then tell you how Moodoro got corrupted by a halfling named Flynn Merrington.
They used to sell the valuable Vasty Deep Water, till Moodoro got caught.&nbsp;
Here's where there is a catch, part of getting to the quest requires asking
a question that is not in brackets. Some people may miss it that way. Nolusia
says that she created a doppleganger to die in Moodoro's place.&nbsp; You
must ask Nolusia 'What is a doppleganger' or 'What about the doppleganger?'
Even though it is not in brackets. She'll tell you it died in Moodoro's
place and he relocated to Qeynos, and that she is afraid that he's started
up again because of Flynn.&nbsp; Lanken Rjarn knows, and they're both afraid
that the High Council will learn of it. So she wants to murder Flynn Merrington.&nbsp;
She wants you to return a bottle of Vasty deep water to her, so that she
can poision it to give it to Flynn.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you say yes, she tells
you to find out how they get their Vasty Deep Waters and to bring a bottle
to her and she will poison the lip you are then to take it to Flynn not
Moodoro and that will end everything.&nbsp; You can get Vasty Deep Waters
by talking to the Bank manager and asking him for it&nbsp; (it may be that
only an enchanter can use it for this quest though). He says your guild
must have sent you to get it.&nbsp; Bring me a guild coin and I will give
you the water.&nbsp; Go back to the temple and ask for a guild coin which
will be given with the message remember this is not currency.&nbsp; The
coin is a lore item that gives +10 mana.&nbsp; Give this to the banker
and he will give you the water and some experience and some faction.&nbsp;
