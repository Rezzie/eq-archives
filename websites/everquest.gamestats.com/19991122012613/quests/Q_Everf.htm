Granin O'Gill:</font>&nbsp; This quest is given to you from Margyn McCann
(she is the Shaman's guildmaster).&nbsp; The activation sentence is "I
am a young shaman".&nbsp; She tells you that she wants Granin O'Gill brought
to justice by bringing her his head.&nbsp; He can be found by the statue
area of Everfrost.&nbsp; Do even try to find him until you are 13th or
in a large group.&nbsp; The Orc Shamans and Orc Mountaineers spawn in the
same area and will wipe you out fast.&nbsp; He hits hard (20 points a pop)
and casts spells, but he does not have alot of hit points.&nbsp; When you
return his head to Margyn you get faction, exp, a few coppers (joy), and
a 1st rank spell.&nbsp; This quest can only be performed by characters
below level 12.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by Jilana)</b>

The activation sentence is "I will protect the pass".&nbsp; If you choose
to accept her quest, she will give you a box with six slots in it for you

minor item, money and some experience.&nbsp; Generous isn't she?&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Ivan McMannus' Remains (H)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Ivan
McMannus' Remains:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; Renth McLanis in McDaniels Smokes
and Spirits seeks to find the remains of Ivan McMannus. He was supposed
to escort Ivan who is a courier, but he ended up drinking the night away
and Ivan got killed. Now he needs to find Ivan's Remains, but he doesn't
know they are located. If you tell him that you will [search for the courier],
he will direct you to Arnis McLish out in Everfrost who will then direct
you to the lady who knows where the remains are (Megan). Arnis tends to
hang out around the ramp into Black Burrow, but he runs around quite a
bit in the area. You may have to chase him down or wait for him to come
back. He will tell you that Snowflake (her pet wolf) can lead you to Megan
if you ask him [where is Megan]? Snowflake is located by the two guards
area on the edge of the tundra. Snowflake will lead you to Megan who is
by the North Tower. If you ask Megan "Where are Ivan's remains?", she will
then tell you her sad story and ask if you [will dive for remains]. When
you tell her that you will, she hands you the special box needed to complete
the quest. The remains are at the bottom of the river and you have to access
them through a hole in the ice. There are at least two holes in the river;
the correct one is near the south side of the river and has a large piece
of white ice jutting out of the frozen river next to the hole. When you
dive, as you descend toward the north you will see a goblin diver. I killed
this one and he only had an ice goblin necklace. The next goblin north
of that one had a barbarian rib in his loot. Fighting the goblins below
water is difficult (they are fast) so I lured them out of the hole in the
ice to kill them on the frozen river surface. The rest of the bones are
located on the river floor and look like small bags. The items you collect
are: Barbarian rib, skull, jaw, and femur.&nbsp; The very first item is
almost directly below the hole in the ice (was the femur for me). The other
two items are further to the north along the very bottom of the river.
I suggest returning to the surface to get a fresh air supply between grabbing
each item. The furthest piece is dangerously far from the hole. A person
needs a swimming skill of around 30 to swim straight to the furthest item
and still be able to return to the hole before drowning. Once you have
all four items, you combine them in the box and give them back to Renth
McLanis. He will reward you with experience, some money, and a minor item.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Tarton's Wheel"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Tarton's Wheel:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest to get the components for the Wizard Spell Ice Comet.&nbsp;
There are 3 NPC's standing along ice wall near Starn bearjumpers place.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Talk with the human wizard Sulgar and he will tell you that he is looking
for tartons wheel.&nbsp; (you must have good faction with beta neutral
to get this quest - unfortunatley, I have no idea what you can do to raise
this faction).&nbsp; He gives you a glowing case and a tome of hints that
spans all over the 3 continents. The case is to hold the spokes of the
wheel and the tome gives you hints on where to find the pieces.&nbsp; Be
aware that the case is a no rent item and will disappear when you log out,
so don't put any rods in it until you are ready to give them to Sulgar.
Tartons wheel apparently lets you travel through the planes.&nbsp; You
combine the pieces you find in the box and get The <a href="../equipment/graphics4/Staff_of_the_Wheel.htm">Staff
of the Wheel</a> (a 1HB weapon) and the star of eyes (a gem which casts
unlimited identify spells).&nbsp; When you give them to him, he will give
you the runes of frost and astral needed to research the ice comet spell.&nbsp;
(Then pray your research doesn't fail).&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 10 pieces
that you need scattered across the face of Norrath. The names of the 10
rods are: Azia, Beza, Caza, Dena, Ena, Fana, Geza, Heda, Izah, Jaka. Be
aware that the rods spawn very rarely, are no drop items, and are just
laying there for anyone to pick up (They are just called "a rod", and identify
as wizard only) so they will be very difficult to get to in time.&nbsp;
Of course, if you are not a wizard, please leave these rods alone, since,
as a no drop and thus nonsaleable item, they are of no value to anyone
other than a high level wizard on this quest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The locations
are as follows:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; [azia] On the ocean floor in Eruds Crossing
past the zombie boat where the zombie sailors hang out.&nbsp; (location
- neg 1162, pos 2340); (2) [beza]&nbsp; In the underwater cave in the Everfrost
plains.&nbsp; It is in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave,
where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the room;&nbsp; (3) [caza]
Lake Rath.&nbsp; Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel
leading to a stone tower.&nbsp; Its on the top floor of the tower. (You
need enduring breath for this one);&nbsp; (4) [Dena] Dagnor's cauldron,
right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep.&nbsp; If you face with your back
to Kedge, it is directly diagagonal left,&nbsp; in a corner.; (5) [Ena]
Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you need
a group for, unless you're brave and kamakazi it. Warning, the floor is
the same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find
with the hand and the dar beating on you;&nbsp; (6) [Fana] Oasis of Marr
in the underwater tower next to the above ground tower, on the top floor;
(7) [Geza] Highhold Pass in the water near the waterfall closest to the
Tiger Inn.&nbsp; There are 2 waterfalls there.&nbsp; The rod is in front
of the one closest to the inn; (8)&nbsp; [Heda] Qeynos Aqueducts, in the
shark pit;&nbsp; (9) [Izah] Neriak in the water in front of the bar called
"the blind fish".&nbsp; The bar has 4 glass windows that are underwater,
and the rod spawns right in front of those windows; (10)&nbsp; [Jaka] Unrest
in the water outside the right side of the house near where the the gnome
speulunker is.&nbsp; Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to him,
you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short passage
where you can find the rod.&nbsp; (Submitted by Shaidar)</b>

These items are no save, no drop, lore items, so you lose them when you
