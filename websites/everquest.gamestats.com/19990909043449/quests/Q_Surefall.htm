<p><a NAME="The Assassin"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Assassin:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This quest is sometimes given to you after you complete the Nitrates quest
in Surefall Glades.&nbsp; Return to surefall and give the note to Gerael
for status and few coins.&nbsp; Gerael&nbsp; returns the note to you and
asks you to give it to Captain Tillim in Qeynos. He asks you to also to
warn the target (Gash Flockwaller) that [They are Trying to kill him].&nbsp;&nbsp;
Go to Qeynos and give the note to Captain Tillim.&nbsp; You are rewarded
with some faction and told that Gash stays in the Lion's head INN. Going
to the Lion's head inn.&nbsp; Gash Flockwaller should be in a back room
during the day. Talking to him and repeating the key phrase as [they are
trying to kill you] gives you a clue about the unkempt druids - that they
carry [black wood chips].&nbsp; Somewhere in this the Assassin will attack
- his name is Raffel Minnmorn.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point the quest may
be broken.&nbsp; One time I beat the assassin with Gash's assistance -
as a result the body dissappeared and I couldn't loot it; the second time
I got a ranger/druid mob together and we splatted him, but since I hadn't
gotten the wood chip comment yet all that I got from him was a rusty dagger.&nbsp;
Raffel con's black to a 10th level ranger, but he has a slew of druid spells
and shouldn't be solo'd unless&nbsp; you are pretty strong or lucky.&nbsp;
So the ending is still unclear.&nbsp; (Submitted by Endager The Ranger)</b>
<p><a NAME="The Bayle List (SG)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Bayle
List:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp; A paladin in the Temple of Thunder
is investigating corruption among the guards of Qeynos. He asks you to
go to Surefall Glade, find Frenway Marthank in the Druids' Guildtree, and
ask him for "The Bayle List."&nbsp; However, when you do, Frenway is in
a state of depression.&nbsp; His son -- who happened to be carrying the
very list you're looking for -- was killed and devoured by the great grizzly
bear Mammoth, who lives deep in the caves of Surefall Glade.&nbsp; As a
Druid, Frenway is forbidden to harm the bears of the Glade, but he wants
vengeance.&nbsp; If you can find and slay Mammoth, you will get the list,
and Frenway will reward you if you return with Mammoth's hide.&nbsp; However,
there are more than a few people in Surefall Glade who will strike you
down for attacking the bears, so be very careful.&nbsp; (Submitted by Shendar)</font></b>
<p><a NAME="Gnasher's Head (QH)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Gnasher's
Head:</font>&nbsp; This quest starts in Surefall Glade.&nbsp; Talk to Larsk
Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher.&nbsp; Too lazy
to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him.&nbsp;
This gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10
or so.&nbsp; Kill him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get
some cash.&nbsp; Sometimes when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt, he is carrying
a note from the bartender at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to the authorities.
First, give the note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give Gnasher's
head to).&nbsp; Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to
Captain Tillian directly. He will give you some experience and a faction
adjustment, and advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena
in Qeynos (the same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will
give you more experience, more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit
(a Lore Item which gives you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will
then summon the Executioner, who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out
the sentence of death pronounced on the unwise bartender.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow
the executioner and watch the fun.&nbsp; Another note.&nbsp; If you are
carrying gnoll fangs for Captain Tillian, give them to him and go collect
the blackburrow stout&nbsp; first, since the executioner will kill your
stout connection and he won't respawn for a while.&nbsp; (Submitted by

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp; This is a massive

<p><a NAME="Jaggedpine Crook Staff"></a><b><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Jagged_Pine_Crook_Staff.htm">Jaggedpine
Crook Staff:</a></font>&nbsp; This quest starts in SureFall Glades.&nbsp;
This quest will not work with too high of a character.&nbsp; Talk with
Corum Finisc, just outside the Jaggedpine of SureFall Glades. After some
keywords, he will mention [crook].&nbsp; This is a Jaggedpine crook staff
that is broken in pieces in Qeynos Hills.&nbsp; Only Gnoll Hunters have
the parts.&nbsp; The gnoll hunters are very rare and getting the staff
pieces is difficult.&nbsp; However, once you have both, go back to Corum
Finisc and he will assemble them for you.</b>

<p><a NAME="The Nitrates"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Nitrates:</font>&nbsp;
Gerael Woodone has a flask he wants delivered to Linaya Sowlin in West
Karana.&nbsp; Doing so results in some faction and a few coppers.&nbsp;
At this point she also asks for your protection from the [unkempt druids]
and tells you of a [note].&nbsp; However, an NPC by the name of Draze Slashyn
shows up and immediately threatens Linaya after you deliver the Flask.
If you beat him you get Status, Money, a Rusty Axe and the Note Linaya
just mentioned. Linaya will ask you to take the note back to Gerael in
surefall (see the Assassins Quest).&nbsp; (Submitted by Endager the Ranger)</b>
<p><a NAME="Poacher's Head"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Poacher's Head:
</font>Talk
to the first ranger you see when you go into the ranger guild house.&nbsp;
It turns out that there is some poacher hunting the animals of SureFall
Glade and he wants you to end this dastardly deed and poach the poacher
instead.&nbsp; Bring his head back as proof that the animals are now safe
and you will get experience, faction and miney or an item.&nbsp; Note for
the Erudites out there that any poacher head seems to work here.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Talym Shoontar's Head"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Talym Shoontar's
Head:&nbsp;</font> You must remove the head of the master poacher Talym
Shoontar from his shoulders and return it to your guild. This quest can
be started either when the guy you turn in the regular poachers head to
mentions him (after turning in a poachers head), or directly started by
talking to Hagar Sureshot in Surefall Glade. Talym appears in Qeynos Hills,
somewhere between the cottage, the road marker, and the Guard Tower. He
appears sometime around midnight, although not apparently every day (at
least he hasn't appeared at times I have been waiting for him). However,
he is about lvl 15, and is roughly on par with Dorn B'Dynn, the scourge
of the Northern Desert of Ro.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, if you attack him in Qeynos
Hills, the guards will attack you.&nbsp; For a safer way to kill him, Shoontar
also occasionally appears in Fish Tavern's back room, where you turn in
the moonstones for gnoll stouts.&nbsp; This may only happen after the executioner
appears following the gnasher's head quest.&nbsp; Another person spotted
Shoontar in Freeport at the docks, so he obviously gets around.&nbsp; You
get money, experience and an item.&nbsp; (Submitted by Vorador)</b>
