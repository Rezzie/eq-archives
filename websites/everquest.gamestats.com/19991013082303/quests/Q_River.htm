<p><a NAME="The Bind"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Bind:</font>&nbsp;
Llscent Tagglefoot by the druids guild is in a bind.&nbsp; He will say
he needs somone to deliver a case of jumjum juice to Xanuusus a treant
in the Northern Karanas Plains. Say "I will take the Jumjum Juice" and
you will be provided with a case. Getting to Treant is a long walk.&nbsp;
Go to North Karana and follow the water to the right.&nbsp; When you hit
the mountains follow them and you will run right into him.&nbsp; I have
been told you no longer have to levitate to give him the jum jum juice.&nbsp;
Also, apparantly Xanuusus is not smart enough or just doesn't care to distinguish
between the jum jum you get from Llscent and that you find from looting
bixies.&nbsp; Who's going to argue with a Treant?&nbsp; So any case of
jum jum juice will work.&nbsp; Factions go up with StormReapers, MayorGubbin,
and MerchantsofRiverVale, and went down with the UnkemptDruids.&nbsp; You
will also get some minor coin and a minor item.&nbsp; Considering that
bixies are very low level creatures and drop jum jum quite frequently,
this may be a good way for low level characters to make some money (Assuming
you survive the trek through N Karana).&nbsp; (Submitted by Kozmo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Blackburrow Stout"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Blackburrow
Stout:</font>&nbsp; Hail Rueppy Kutpurse and she asks if you want something
to drink. Ask her what she wants to drink and she says how about beer.&nbsp;
After you give her a beer, she says it's good, but not as good as blackburrow
stout.&nbsp; (But what is?)&nbsp; Ask here about blackburrow stout and
she responds that you can smuggle it.&nbsp; If you then ask her about smuggling
and she will ask you if you want a job.&nbsp; Should you choose to accept,
you have to go to the ruins on the other side of the great wall, find Gungrich,
and tell him that Dark Rivers Flow East.&nbsp; The ruins are the undead
hill on the other side of the wall in Misty Thicket.&nbsp; When you say
this to Gunrich, he gives you a case of blackburrow stout.&nbsp; Take the
case back to Rueppy Kutpurse and she gives you some small change and experience.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="The Bloody Shank"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Bloody Shank:</font>&nbsp;
Be warned that this quest can really mess with your faction with the deep
pockets.&nbsp; Visit the Captain standing out on a balcony in Highhold
Keep. Hail him and answer his questions.&nbsp; It seems a petty rogue escaped
the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The rogue's
<a href="../equipment/graphics6/Bloody_Shank.html">Bloody
Shank</a> was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives you the
shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to kill
him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the Deeppockets
in Rivervale.&nbsp; He may sometimes be found around the southernmost tower
in Rivervale.&nbsp; Hand him the bloody shank and then kill him, but be
careful because a bodyguard sometimes spawns next to him when you hand
him the shank and also the guards will help him if they are nearby. Killing
him lowers faction with Deeppockets,&nbsp; Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition
of Trade Folk and Carson McCabe and raises it with Merchants of Rivervale.&nbsp;
Return his head for decent money and experience.&nbsp; You will raise faction
with Highpass Guards, Carson McCabe, Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos
Guards
and Freeport Militia.&nbsp; There is also a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot
on the second floor of the Fool's Gold.&nbsp; When you hand him the bloody
shank he does not give the generic (Thank you.) response. Not sure what
happens if you slay him too.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ebaemnn o' the Rose and

wants you to prove yourself as the new dishwasher by finding a missing
jewel that is inside of a fish named Chomper.&nbsp; Chomper is a level
3 small aggressive fish that can be found in the water by the Rivervale
docks.&nbsp; He always spawns with a Large Ruby that you return for some
faction, experience, and some silver.&nbsp; You will get the following

Talk to the Female Marshall in the first hall before the Sheriff and she
will send you down to the lake to talk to the shopkeeper there, who I believe
is named Fiddy Bobek, about his problem.&nbsp; He tells you that there
are piranha eating all of the fish in the lake.&nbsp; He wants you to kill
the piranha and bring him their teeth as proof.&nbsp; He also mentions
bringing one back to the Marshall to prove he's not crazy.&nbsp; Well he
isn't crazy, and there are indeed piranha in there.&nbsp; Jump in and start
killing piranha (be careful they tend to come in pairs&nbsp; - and keep
an eye on your air meter).&nbsp; Each tooth gets you between one and two
gold pieces -- real good money for a level 7 or 8 player.&nbsp; They also
have fish and scales as loot, so you can conceivably get more than 2 gold
per fish.&nbsp; Plus if you give him 4 at a time, you sometimes get an
item.&nbsp; You get the following faction changes for each tooth:&nbsp;
MayorGubbin, merchantsofrivervale, deeppockets, guardiansofthevale all
go up,&nbsp; coalitionoftradesfolkIII goes down.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you bring
a tooth back to the Marshall as proof, she will give you a bag to fill
with four teeth.&nbsp; Fill the bag and combine it and give it back to
her and you may sometimes receive a nice item.&nbsp; Your faction changes
for this ware the same as giving the teeth to Fiddy.</b>

Shakey the Scarecrow, and one of the Leafsway NPCs will comment that Shakey

the head and the stuffing. It seems Shakey's stuffing is rather old, and
his pumpkin head is beginning to crack.&nbsp;&nbsp; To fix his stuffing,
you need magical hay.&nbsp; The Magical Hay that must be harvested can
only be found in the Plains of Karana.&nbsp; If you travel to the corn
fields of West Karana and kill some Scarecrows there, you may sometimes
get some magic hay for loot.&nbsp; I have laso been told that Cleet Miller
will drop bails of hay as he wanders his field.&nbsp; Next, you are required
to obtain a Flask of the Blessed Oil of Life.&nbsp; How to obtain this
is detailed in The Blessed Oil Quest in W Karana.&nbsp; Now comes the very
hardest part.&nbsp; You must have the hay cursed by the High Priest of
Cazic-Thule named Roror, who lives in the Feerrott.&nbsp; Hail him and
say 'Bless my hay' or 'Curse my hay' he will tell you he wants 66 gold
to bless the hay. Give him the 66 gold and hay at the same time, he will
give you back a sack of cursed hay.&nbsp; When you do this, your faction
with beta neutral goes up, which is important for wizards who want to do
the ice comet quest later on.&nbsp; After the hay is cursed, you must find
a forge, such as you would use to make armor, and combine the cursed hay
with the blessed oil of life and you will get a sack of writhing hay.&nbsp;
You must have a good blacksmithing skill to so this.&nbsp; Then give the
result to Shakey and you will receive a pretty nice item (<a href="../equipment/graphics/Wee_Harvester.htm">Wee

This quest involves gaining at a lot of faction points (the exact number
is unknown and depends on your starting faction) through whatever method
you can use.&nbsp; You gain the points doing most Rivervale quests including:
Giving Runnyeye Warbeads to Sheriff Rogilo (worth 1 point each necklace),
giving Deathfist Slashed Belt to Deputy Budo (worth approximately 5 points
each belt), killing goblins (worth 1-3 points),&nbsp; killing Mooto (he
is worth around 20 points), or just killing lots and lots of goblins. Once
you achieve enough faction points you ask Marshal Ghobber who is located
on the bottom floor of the bank, "Am I one with the Wall?" you will receive
a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Squad_Ring.htm">Squad
Ring</a></font> (charged with an 80 hp healing spell).&nbsp; The ring can
be recharged by a female cleric in Rivervale, but you need a different
