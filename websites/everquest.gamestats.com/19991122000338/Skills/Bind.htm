<p><b>This is a very useful skill to have as a magician.&nbsp; Combined
with summon bandages, a mid to high level magician can heal almost as fast
as a bard.&nbsp; It is also useful for other non-healing classes.&nbsp;
It will stop bleeding in people who are unconscious and allow them to start
gaining hps back again.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of time
to target and get the skill applied to an unconscious person before they
die, so if you are going to use this skill you should have it as a hotkey.&nbsp;
It also only heals a person up to one half his total hit points and will
do nothing after that.</b>
<p><b>You seem to gain about .25 per skill point, which means you bind
1 hp per every 4 skill points.&nbsp; The skill goes up quite quickly, only
needing three bandages or so to go up a skill point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus at
skill level 100 (which would be near max for a level 20 magician), you
will be able to bind around 25 points per bandage.&nbsp; With the small
amount of mana it takes to summon bandages, a magician can summon, heal
and med several times to help bring the injured fighters back to health
much faster than if they just sat there and healed.&nbsp; It isn't as good
as having one of the priestly classes, but it's not bad.&nbsp; It is possible
that 100 is the cap for this skill.</b>
<p><b>NOTE:&nbsp; There is one thing to keep in mind when someone else
is binding your wounds. DO NOT MOVE. This will cause that person to be
stuck in position. If you are the one binding the wounds and this happens,
click the sit button (Spells button works too).&nbsp; This will override
the bind wound. You will need to stand back up before you can move again
though.</b>
<p><b>Note about summon bandage spell. You get 2 bandages for levels 4-8.
Above level 8 you will get 1 bandage for every 2 levels your magician is,
ie. 6 at level 12, 7 at level 14, 8 at level 16, etc.&nbsp; (Submitted
