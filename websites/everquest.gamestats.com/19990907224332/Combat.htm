<blockquote><a NAME="How to Group Properly"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Grouping</font></font></i>
(these rules are very generic, and vary depending on the makeup of the
group)</b>
<blockquote><b>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although you sometimes have little control
over whom you group with, you should try to make up a balanced group.&nbsp;
A group of 3 wizards is all attack and no defense, and will probably lead
to 3 dead bodies.&nbsp; A good group includes at least one of each of the
three class categories I listed above.&nbsp; Of course many classes, especially
Bards and Druids, can handle a little of each role.&nbsp; A tank is an
absolute necessity, but in a pinch the pet of a necro or magician can sometimes
work.&nbsp; An attacking magic user such as a wizard is also important
to kill the runners before they go get help or slam them when the fighter
starts to hurt.&nbsp; Never turn down the addition of a cleric and his
healing powers or a enchanter and his buffing powers.&nbsp; When forming
a group, remember that the experience and gold are split between the members.&nbsp;
Thus, if experience and gold are the only considerations, a good rule of
thumb is to form only as big a group as is necessary to beat the monsters
you plan on attacking.&nbsp; Of course part of the fun of grouping is meeting
new people and hanging out, so don't turn down an additional body just
to squeeze a little more experience out of the game.</b>
<p><b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you start to hunt, establish the rules with
your group.&nbsp; The group leader has a lot of responsibility for this.&nbsp;
Leadership and party discipline can make or break a group.&nbsp; Determine
in what order you will loot bodies and whether you will keep on autosplit.&nbsp;
I would suggest you loot alphabetically and always split loot (just remember
to turn it off before you get your corpse).&nbsp; It is the leader's responsibility
to keep track of whose turn it is to loot.&nbsp; Make sure everyone knows
their roles so that there is no confusion during the battle.&nbsp; A little
talk before going out may save someone's life.</b>
<p><b>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; A basic rule for parties is that you want to spend
as little time sitting on your butt as possible.&nbsp; If you end a battle
with one of the fighters way down in hit points or one of the magic users
way down in mana, the whole party will have to go sit and wait for them
to regenerate.&nbsp; Ideally, everyone should be down about the same amount
so that the rest is needed equally by everyone.&nbsp; A fighter who stands
in and takes all the damage while the rest of the group stays healthy or
a wizard who blasts indiscriminately and wastes all his mana on a weak
monster will soon find themselves having difficulty finding a group willing
to take them. Remember that mana regenerates much faster than hit points,
but hit points can be healed by a cleric or bard.</b>
<p><b>d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you go out and start the hunt, designate who
will take the lead.&nbsp; If you have a ranger, he should always take the
lead since he can track the best monsters.&nbsp; Otherwise, it should be
the group's tank.&nbsp; There are two basic strategies with this.&nbsp;
Everyone can just follow the leader until he reaches an attackable creature
then try and quickly form their places and attack, or the group can park
in a defensible spot and send one member out as a runner to attack a creature
and lead it back to where the rest of the party is waiting in ambush.&nbsp;
Personally I prefer the latter strategy, but it does mean more time sitting
around waiting for something to spawn.&nbsp; One point on this is that
you need to follow the leader.&nbsp; This can't be emphasized enough.&nbsp;
Most people play in first person mode and can't see if you are behind them.&nbsp;
They have to assume you are following.&nbsp; If you wander off, you won't
be there to help the others and they won't be able to come to your rescue
when you get attacked by that mad grizzly bear.</b>
<p><b>e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fighters: Your role is to make sure that the monsters
always attack you and stay off of the spell casters.&nbsp; Don't forget
your taunt skill.&nbsp; Use it to keep the monsters attacking you.&nbsp;
You should go in first and soften the monsters up before the spell casters
administer the killing blow.&nbsp; Since the fighter is the least easily
killed, when the fighter yells run, the whole party should immediately
hightail it to safety.</b>
<p><b>f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magic Support.&nbsp; You should keep the whole party,
especially the fighters, buffed at all times.&nbsp; If you think enough
time has passed that your buffs may have worn off, remind the stupid fighters
to let you know when they need more.&nbsp; Clerics should constantly watch
the life meters of other party members and cast heal if they get below
&frac12;.&nbsp; If you have a decent attack ability, when you aren't healing
or supporting, step in and take a few whacks now and then.&nbsp; Just make
sure you don't do so much damage that the monster turns on you instead
of the fighter.&nbsp; Also, remember that you can do more damage to the
rear of a monster.&nbsp; You should also keep and eye out for incoming
monsters.&nbsp; As soon as you see another approaching, yell out to your
group.</b>
<p><b>g.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attack Magic.&nbsp; Stand back patiently while the
battle begins.&nbsp; If you want to, go ahead and carefully step in and
take a few whacks at the monster.&nbsp; Keep and eye on the life meters
of the fighters and if they are getting worse than they give, help out
by blasting the monster a few times.&nbsp; You don't want to attack too
soon, since monsters have an annoying habit of going after the person doing
the most damage, and you don't want it to focus on you.&nbsp; While it
can be amusing to see a magic user running around in circles being chased
by a monster while the rest of the party tries to hack at it, it is also
self defeating (and usually bad for the health of the magic user).&nbsp;
As soon as the monster takes off, cast root to stop it, or if it is really
low on hit points just blast it down.&nbsp; You should also keep and eye
out for incoming monsters.&nbsp; As soon as you see another approaching,
yell out to your group</b>
<p><b>h.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for wizards and fighters, most classes can
cross over to some extent to these three main areas.&nbsp; Assign out the
main roles, but don't be afraid to vary if the fight is going badly.</b>
<p><b>i.&nbsp; When someone yells run, don't hesitate to run to safety
(hopefully you have already made note of where the nearest safe spot is).&nbsp;
You know at least one of your party is no longer fighting with you, and
your chances of not dying have dropped considerably.&nbsp; Besides, if
you're playing with a good group, there's probably a good reason someone
yelled run.&nbsp; Get out of there now.</b><b></b>

Specific group strategies:</font></font></i></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Warrior Group Strategies"></a><b>1)&nbsp;
Warrior.&nbsp; This is easy.&nbsp; Attack.&nbsp; Attack.&nbsp; Attack.&nbsp;
Also, protect your spell casters.&nbsp; You should be the one who runs
out and initiates the combat whenever possible.&nbsp; That way you are
the one the monster focuses on from the start.&nbsp; Use your taunt whenever
the monster decides to go after one of those weak mage types.&nbsp; Don't
forget to use your combat skills.&nbsp; If your hit points are getting
low, back away and let someone else take some damage, even a spell caster.&nbsp;
Dying doesn't help your group any.&nbsp; Fighters of all types are good
group leaders since they are the ones who initiate combat most of the time.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Paladin Group Strategies"></a><b>2)&nbsp; Paladin.&nbsp;
Same as warrior for the most part.&nbsp; Save your lay hands for the most
desperate situation.&nbsp; Better to lose it in a day than waste it.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Ranger Group Strategies"></a><b>3)&nbsp; Ranger.&nbsp;
Same as warrior as far as the tank abilities.&nbsp; In addition, because
of your tracking skill, you will probably be the leader when outdoors.&nbsp;
Track a monster that the group can handle and lead it back to the group
to be disposed of.&nbsp; Or if you prefer, track the monster and lead the
group to it.&nbsp; If you are doing this, you should change your views
so that you can see behind you and can be sure that everyone is actually
following you.&nbsp; Also, keep and eye out for killer monsters and warn
your group if they are in the area.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Monk Group Strategies"></a><b>4)&nbsp; Monk.&nbsp;
Same as warrior in most respects.&nbsp; Use your feign death skill.&nbsp;
If the group is in trouble, you should be the one to buy time for the rest
of the party since you can use feign death to convince the monsters you
are dead and maybe help the entire party survive.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Shadow Warrior Group Strategies"></a><b>5)&nbsp;
Shadow Knight.&nbsp; Same as Warrior.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Rogue Group Strategies"></a><b>6)&nbsp; Rogue.&nbsp;
Unless you don't have a tank, you don't want to be the focus of the monster's
attention.&nbsp; Instead let the fighter type get its attention and get
behind it and backstab.&nbsp; Keep backstabbing.&nbsp; This is a great
skill for grouping.&nbsp; Also, if you have the time, you might as well
pick the monster's pocket for some extra cash.&nbsp; If you are in a situation
where nobody in the party knows what's ahead, use your sneak skill to scout
the area.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Cleric Group Strategies"></a><b>7)&nbsp; Cleric.&nbsp;
Everyone is relying on you to keep them alive.&nbsp; This is a big responsibility.&nbsp;
Watch your party members' life meters and heal anyone who starts to get
below half.&nbsp; When healing is not needed either step in and take a
few whacks or stay back and keep and eye out for any new creatures so that
you can warn your party.&nbsp; Prior to the battle, you should buff up
the party to keep them strong.&nbsp; Also, don't forget lull if you are
planning on attacking a group of monsters.&nbsp; Don't waste your mana.&nbsp;
Your heal spells may be the only thing standing between the party and disaster.&nbsp;
The ideal strategy for a group with 2 tanks and a cleric is for the tanks
to alternate attacks, with one attacking and the other standing back getting
healed.&nbsp; This way you can keep a full strength fighter on the monster
at all times.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Shaman Group Strategies"></a><b>8)&nbsp; Shaman.&nbsp;
If you have a lot of firepower up front, stand back and heal when needed
(like a cleric), and make sure your fighters are buffed and ready to fight.&nbsp;
If they get in trouble, wade in and start bashing or cast damage spells.&nbsp;
You can dish out some decent damage.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Druid Group Strategies"></a><b>9)&nbsp; Druid.
The druid's strategy really depends upon the makeup of the group.&nbsp;
You are probably the travel guide for the group because of your travel
spells.&nbsp; Prior to the battle, keep the fighters buffed.&nbsp; Once
a battle starts, cast your damage shields on the fighters so that they
can start hurting the monsters back when they get attacked.&nbsp; Then
your actions depend on your role.&nbsp; If you are the parties only healer,
try to save your mana for heal spells and play it much like a cleric.&nbsp;
If you are filling in on the wizard role, then by all means strike down
the runners.&nbsp; Ideally, given time to meditate, you can buff the party
before combat, destroy creatures during it, and heal everyone afterwards.&nbsp;
(Thanks to Starkinder for the input on Druids)</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Bard Group Strategies"></a><b>10)&nbsp; Bard.&nbsp;
Always watch your party's life meters.&nbsp; If everyone is high, either
play a buff song, battle song or damage song.&nbsp; It really depends on
what you're attacking.&nbsp; As soon as people start to drop play the heal
song.&nbsp; You are crucial to the groups survival since as long as you
are alive the group can outrun any monster (assuming you are high enough
to have the accelerate song).&nbsp; If the party looks like it is in trouble,
switch to the accelerando and tell the party which way they should run.&nbsp;
If you can keep the party together, you should be able to help them survive
by running away faster than the monster can pursue.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Magician Group Strategies"></a><b>11)&nbsp; Magician.&nbsp;
Let your pet do all the work for you.&nbsp; Don't even look for a group
unless you have plenty of Malachite to summon pets.&nbsp; A magician without
a pet is really just a weak wizard, and not very much help to a group.&nbsp;
Remember that his death means nothing, and a group members means everything.&nbsp;
Send him into the hardest places.&nbsp; Support him with spells, but don't
let your mana lag too far behind.&nbsp; You are also the group's provisioner.&nbsp;
Volunteer to stock up your group members with food and water.&nbsp; It
doesn't cost you anything other than mana.&nbsp; This will make you very
popular, since those items cost enough money to get really annoying, and
it's a real pain to have to go back to town just to buy more bread.&nbsp;
Many people don't realize you can summon food and won't ask, so be sure
to volunteer it to the group.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Necromancer Group Strategies"></a><b>12)&nbsp;
Necromancer.&nbsp; Let the skeleton do the nasty work.&nbsp; Since your
spells tend to do damage over time, if you plan on casting them, cast them
early.&nbsp; It might be a good idea to cast and then immediately sit and
meditate.&nbsp; You can never have enough mana.The necro pet is usually
1 level below the level of the necro. At 20th and up they have magic attacks,
dual wield and riposte.&nbsp; The pets can be buffed and with the bareknuckle
delay are a very good addition to a group.&nbsp; Necros are particularly
good group members if you are fighting a large crit.&nbsp; Their damage
over time spells at 20 will reach over 800 when combined and at 29th well
over 1000.&nbsp; Combine this with the pet damage and the 95 + DD spell
against undead and 65+ DD against live creatures and you have a damage
dealing partner.&nbsp; Necros are also good paired.&nbsp; They work very
well with a druid.&nbsp; One warning sent to me:&nbsp; When grouped with
4 or less the group needs to treat the pet as a player in terms of making
sure damage is shared.&nbsp; The reason for this is (unless you are fighting
blues or yellows in which case why be grouped ) the damage over time spells
will direct the creature to the necro or another party member like the
wiz if the pet dies.&nbsp; I have seen many times in smaller groups...pet
dies group flees and dies.&nbsp; Now this is not to say that the pet should
not die first if necessary, it definitely should, BUT the crit being attacked
should at least be at a level of health that the group can finish off with
a surety.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Enchanter Group Strategies"></a><b>13)&nbsp; Enchanter.&nbsp;
Keep your party buffed at all times.&nbsp; Before the battle starts debuff
the tougher monsters to make them easier to kill.&nbsp; One of the better
spells of the enchanter is lull.&nbsp; If you are thinking of attacking
a group of monsters, but not sure you can take the entire group, lull the
ones you want to stay back and pick them off one at a time.&nbsp; With
an enchanter, a group can take on some of the camps and survive.&nbsp;
If the battle is going well, there is no reason not to step in and attack
with your dagger or staff.</b>
<p><a NAME="AllaKhazam's Wizard Group Strategies"></a><b>14)&nbsp; Wizard.&nbsp;
Conserve your mana.&nbsp; Let the fighters start a battle and sit back
and watch.&nbsp; You don't want to attack too soon and have the monster
focus on you instead of the tank.&nbsp; Part of the way into the battle,
you can go in and start to hit the monster for the little bit of damage
you can do.&nbsp; It won't faze the monster so you are safe.&nbsp; If the
fighters start to fade a little, blast the monster with a few spells.&nbsp;
If it gets low, you can finish it off.&nbsp; If the battle starts to get
desperate, blast it with all you have.&nbsp; You are the last resort in
that case.&nbsp; If it starts to run cast root to stop it in its tracks
or just blast it down.&nbsp; Always keep an eye out for incoming monsters
so that you can warn your fighters.&nbsp; Remember you can regenerate mana
about 3 times faster than the fighters can regen hit points, so once the
party sits you want to have times it so that you need as much sitting time
as the fighters.</b></blockquote>

<a NAME="Tips for Solo Adventuring"></a><b><i><font color="#FF0000"><font size=+1>Solo
Strategies</font></font></i></b>
<blockquote><b>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule number one of soloing is to not do it
(at least after the first few levels).</b>
<p><b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to solo, this is my suggestion.&nbsp;
Find a place where there is either a zone barrier or a guard tower and
a where you can find a number of monsters who con blue.&nbsp; Keep within
easy running distance of safety and look for monsters you can handle.&nbsp;
Like a deer hunter, you may find a lot of your time spent sitting around
waiting for your prey.&nbsp; Change your view so that you can see if anything
is sneaking up behind you and attack anything that cons blue (you'll quickly
learn what you can beat).&nbsp; Unless you are completely absolutely convinced
you are one or two strikes away from killing it, if your meter gets below
1/2, turn and run to safety.&nbsp; If anything other than the monster you
are attacking starts your way, turn and run for safety.&nbsp; If your mana
gets below 1/3, turn and run for safety.&nbsp; Learn to be a coward and
you may actually live a while.&nbsp; Keep in mind that if your place of
safety is a guard tower, you may get hit once or twice before the guards
manage to kill the intruder, so you should run even sooner.</b></blockquote>
