<p><a NAME="Bandit Sisters (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bandit Sisters:</font>&nbsp;
This starts in Felwithe with the High Elf Paladin Guildmaster.&nbsp; He
will ask you&nbsp; if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"&nbsp;
Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you
are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).&nbsp; If you
say you are inexperienced,&nbsp; he tells you about a fallen member of
his order in Kelethin.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you say you are experienced, he
gives you the jojongua's pelt quest).&nbsp;&nbsp; You then need to talk
to the drunk named Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale.&nbsp;
His sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser Faydark who have
joined the dervish cutthrouat and are giving his family a bad name.&nbsp;
Being a good father and paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters,
retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all at once.&nbsp;
Beware.&nbsp; These bandits are pretty tough and will not willingly part
with their jewelry (approximately level 10 to 13).&nbsp; You will get experience,
faction and an item when you return all four necklaces.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Gearheart (A)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Gearheart:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
Baxok Curhunter will ask you if you will serve the crown, and once you
are about 5th level he will give you a quest to hunt down a stolen clockwork
named Gearheart who has been taken by the fae in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;
Gearheart is found at&nbsp; the faerie city.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is in&nbsp;
his mid teens (probably around&nbsp; level 15). When you kill gearheart,
you get a faction loss (faerie), some change and a 'blackbox XIVD' which,
when given to Baxok Curhunter, gives you some change, a couple of faction
changes, and an item, possibly a round shield.&nbsp; The quest is worth
a platinum or two.&nbsp; (Submitted by Wael and Toraque)</font></b>
