<p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabrael kneeled as she crested the small rise, scanning
the tracks near her.&nbsp; She had been trailing this Gnoll hunter for
about an hour now, and she knew she was close.&nbsp; It would be the last
day he did any poaching near Surefall Glade.&nbsp; She glanced behind her
and sighed.&nbsp; They were still following her, as they had been for a
while now.&nbsp; I guess they thought she would lead them to easy prey,
this small group of adventurers behind her.&nbsp; She shrugged to herself
and rose, trotting down the hill, scanning the treeline in front of her.&nbsp;
Then she saw him, weighed down with the pelts he was carrying, about 200
yards in front of her, almost to the trees, already partially hidden by
the scrub growing outside the forest.&nbsp; She stopped and raised her
arms abover her, chanting in the Elvish language, and she felt the magic
course through her body.&nbsp; The Gnoll was surrounded briefly by a greenish
glow, then the plants and roots around him began to grab at him, their
rough branches</i></b>
<br><b><i>ripping through the shabby clothes he wore and into his flesh.&nbsp;
He had enough time to turn and howl in frustration before she sent the
first arrow singing into him from her ashwood bow.&nbsp; A few more arrows
and it was over, the gnoll slumping lifelessly to the ground as the plants
released their hold.&nbsp; She kenlt down over the body and began to collect
the skins and the small&nbsp; amount of cash on the Gnoll, as she heard
the group approaching her from behind.&nbsp; "M'lady," a voice came, "might
we have a moment of your time?&nbsp; We&nbsp; were impressed with the efficiency
with which you dispatched this foul</i></b>
<br><b><i>beast, and were wondering if you might speak with us for a moment
about the bow you carry..."&nbsp; She smiled even as she listened...she
was always happy to discuss her craft of fletching and the use of bows,
especially when she could smell a sale...</i></b>
<p><b>Archery</b>
<p><b>In this rambling diatribe, I am going to discuss with you the proper
use of bows in the world of Norrath.&nbsp; I will begin with a general
discussion, and progress on to more specific information for each class
that can use a bow.</b>
<p><b>First off, 99% of people out there don't have a clue how to use a
bow.&nbsp; I cannot count the number of times I have heard the statement
"Bows are only&nbsp; good for one shot before the monster gets to you,"
or "bows are only good for&nbsp; finishing off monsters that run away."&nbsp;
While a bow CAN accomplish these two feats (drawing monsters to you, and
finishing them off), it can be used in much more effective ways as well.&nbsp;
But the use of a bow requires some qualities lacking in some people...finesse,
at least a modicum of intelligence, and a firm grasp of simple tactics.</b>
<p><b>When you start using a bow, which you should do as early on as you
can, DON'T buy one from a merchant.&nbsp; They do nothing but rip you off.&nbsp;
They sell "Hunting" bows for 5gp or so, Shortbows for more than 4pp, and
Longbows for nearly 5pp.&nbsp; What a waste.&nbsp; A simple Hickory Recurve
bow made by any player with a decent fletching skill has the same range
and delay as a Shortbow OR a Hunting Bow, and does TWICE the damage.&nbsp;
I sell them for 1pp, and so does everyone I know, unless I have to drag
it halfway across the continent, then I sell it for 2pp.&nbsp; Quite a
bargain, considering.&nbsp; Longbows SEEM nice because they have a range
of 100, but I make Elm bows with a range of 75 and a damage of 13 (as compared
to the Longbow's damage of 8) and sell them for 7pp, or a little more if
I have to haul them a long ways.&nbsp; Still quite a deal, considering
the damage it does.&nbsp; Anyway, after that, the bows just get better&nbsp;
(but more expensive also).&nbsp; You should always carry and use the best
bow you think you can afford.&nbsp; I won't lie to you...the best bows
(Oak and Darkwood) run into the hundreds of platinum to make and buy, but
these are for high level&nbsp; characters anyway, and they can usually
afford them.&nbsp; Besides, like any good weapon, a bow is a one-time purchase
until you decide to upgrade, at which time you can usually trade in or
sell your old bow and lower the price of&nbsp; your new one.</b>
<p><b>Arrows are of little consideration in comparison to the bow.&nbsp;
Simple 1sp arrows, sold by many merchants, are good enough for most uses.&nbsp;
Only the best archers (i.e. higher level) should need different arrows,
and they get them from a fletcher, not a merchant.&nbsp; These arrows do
more damage at a better range, but cost more as well.&nbsp; Beginners and
even most mid-level (10-15) should stick with the basic arrows.</b>
<p><b>So now you know bows are expensive, at least the really good ones.&nbsp;
So you ask, what good are they?&nbsp; Well, to put it in the simplest possible
terms, they are a substitute for the offensive spells that you don't get.
Rogues and Warriors never learn spells, and Rangers and Shadowknights have
pathetic offensive capabilities as far as magic goes.&nbsp; At 9th level,
Rangers get one offensive spell, Flame Lick or Burst of Fire or some other
such nonsense.&nbsp; This does about 5 points of damage to the target creature,
lowers it's AC a few points, and really ticks it off.&nbsp; Even the spells
that Rangers and&nbsp; Shadowknights get at 22nd level are being thrown
around by 8th level Druids and Necromancers.&nbsp; Needless to say, the
monsters you will be fighting at 22nd level will be unimpressed with your
magic, to say the least.&nbsp; But if you have a bow, on the other hand,
things change...</b>
<p><b>Even at 9th level, my ranger was able to dish out 17 damage consistently
with her Ash recurve bow and cheap, 1sp arrows.&nbsp; On average, I could
get 3 shots on a given creature before it got into melee range, and if
I used my Snare spell beforehand, that increased to 4 or 5 shots!&nbsp;
That is up to 85 points of damage BEFORE I had to start swinging a sword.&nbsp;
Not bad at 9th level. How did I accomplish this?</b>
<p><b>Basic Bow Tactics</b>
<p><b>Those people who only shoot a monster once before melee are one of
3 things:</b>
<p><b>a) Inside an enclosed space, like a dungeon.</b>
<br><b>b) Fighting VERY fast monsters.</b>
<br><b>c) Stupid.</b>
<p><b>After you are done reading this, go fire up your character, look
at your keyboard, and press the down-arrow key.&nbsp; I hope that you are
not amazed to find that your character moves backwards when you do this.&nbsp;
You should know this already.&nbsp; So, the question is, if you can move
backwards, and if you can fire arrows at a full run (which you can, unlike
spells), why are you shooting an arrow and then standing there, waiting
to get attacked?&nbsp; Pick a target, fire an arrow, and start running
backwards, firing more arrows.&nbsp; You should get 3 shots on the average
monster before melee.&nbsp; And you won't have run that far either.&nbsp;
The only bit of thinking this even requires is to look behind you so you
don't run off a cliff, into a bandit camp, or the maw of a waiting griffin.&nbsp;
That's it.&nbsp; Basic bow tactics.&nbsp; You should also know that switiching
from firing arrows to melee is as simple as pressing your auto-attack button.&nbsp;
No need to switch weapons or anything.&nbsp; And to switch back, say to
shoot a fleeing monster, just turn auto-attack off and start shooting.&nbsp;
Simple as that.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it just gets better from there.</b>
<p><b>Warriors and Bows</b>
<p><b>For the Warrior class, a bow is a must have item.&nbsp; They get
no spell ability whatsoever, and their role seems to be limited to standing
in front, dishing out and recieving damage.&nbsp; While that is all well
and good, and indeed a necessary role, all too often I have seen the Warriors
of the world run up and start hacking on some monster only to have another
spawn next to them or wander by and join in.&nbsp; Why not draw that monster
away from the spawning point, or a bit closer to a safe spot near the guards,
by shooting it with a bow first, perhaps even several times, before melee
begins?&nbsp; Or better yet, in a group, the Warrior can intitiate the
combat by shooting, drawing the monster to the entire group.&nbsp; And
if the group contains spellcasters with Root, Grasping Root, or another
"hold in place" spell, or better yet, Pets of some sort, then why not just
sit back and hammer the poor, helpless creature with arrows while it is
held immoble by a spell or fighting some Pet? Play smart.</b>
<br><b>Conserve your hit points.&nbsp; It reduces your horrendous downtime,
and allows the casters of your party to conserve their mana for damaging
opponents instead of healing you.&nbsp; You will kill more things in less
time if you play like this.&nbsp; Isn't that what being a warrior is all
about?&nbsp; And if you spend your time alone, wouldn't it be nice to be
able to win easily a fight that would have otherwise been very close, all
because you spent 3 silver pieces and thwacked 3 arrows into a monster
before you started hacking on it?</b>
<p><b>Rogues and Bows</b>
<p><b>Almost everything I just said about Warriors applies to Rogues too.
The only exception is that Rogues rarely stand up front taking all the
damage.&nbsp; So what do you do while the monster is Held at a distance
by some spell and the rest of the party is blasting away at it?&nbsp; Sneak
up to it and Backstab?&nbsp; Depending on the situation, this can be pure
suicide.&nbsp; Suddenly the monster breaks free and turns on YOU, or, worse
yet, something even worse wanders by or spawns near the monster and jumps
all over you.&nbsp; Backstab is a good way to help a group that is already
in melee combat, but you shouldn't have to be the only one who is up there
next to the monster.&nbsp; Buy a bow.&nbsp; Sit back a bit.&nbsp; Shoot
for a while.&nbsp; Make the easy money.&nbsp; BE A ROGUE.&nbsp; And Rogues
have the advantage that, since they don't buy the really expensive armors,
and they have a ready source of cash (picking pockets), they can afford
the best weapons, including bows.&nbsp; A solo Rogue should NEVER be without
a bow, just for the versitility it adds.&nbsp; And bows are so much better
than any throwing weapon in the game it's almost ridiculous.</b>
<p><b>Rangers and Bows</b>
<p><b>The Ranger class (and Shadowknights) is where the use of a bow really
comes into it's own.&nbsp; At low levels, you are just like a Warrior,
with about the same abilities (You get Kick later, but that's made up for
with Tracking and Forage).&nbsp; When you hit 9th level, though, your life
can become a lot easier.&nbsp; Go buy the Snare spell and the best bow
you can afford.&nbsp; Go find some soon-to-be-a-corpse monster out in the
open somewhere.&nbsp; One that /cons white, or even yellow if you are confident.&nbsp;
Look behind you, and make sure there isn't anything dangerous back there.&nbsp;
Cast Snare on this hapless being, and start running backwards shooting
arrows.&nbsp; After about 5 arrows or so, and hopefully 50-85 points of
damage, he will catch you.&nbsp; Mop him up in melee combat.&nbsp; Collect
your loot.&nbsp; Heal up a little bit.&nbsp; Repeat.&nbsp; Have a friend
join in if you want...it's always more fun with friends.&nbsp; And at 15th
level, it just gets better.&nbsp; You get Grasping Roots, which not only
holds the</b>
<br><b>monster still while you rain death down on it, but the spell itself
does damage too!&nbsp; What more could you ask for?&nbsp; This works alone
or in groups.&nbsp; With Grasping Roots, it even works in enclosed spaces,
where there isn't room to run backwards.&nbsp; What a cakewalk.</b>
<p><b>Shadowknights and Bows</b>
<p><b>Shadowknights are actually, in my opinion, the best class to have
a bow with.&nbsp; The tactics are EXACTLY the same as for the Ranger, except
instead of Snare and Grasping Roots, you get to summon Pets.&nbsp; You
don't EVER have to run backwards.&nbsp; Just send the pet after the monster,
and rain in arrows on it until your pet or it is dead.&nbsp; If your pet
dies first, you should EASILY be able to mop it up in melee.&nbsp; I have
never played a Shadowknight, and I don't know how tough pets are, but this
tactic seems nearly unbeatable to me, especially in a group.&nbsp; Especially
if that group also has pets and/or Root&nbsp; spells.&nbsp; Good grief,
why WOULDN'T you carry a bow?&nbsp; You will NEVER get a spell that can
dish out damage like a good bow.</b>
<p><b>Archery skill</b>
<p><b>So, with all this in mind, maybe I have you convinced bows are a
good thing.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; Its just my opinion, but the only GOOD
reason for not using a bow is "it doesn't fit with my concept of my character."&nbsp;
Role-playing a charcater that feels a bow would be unchivalrous (or whatever)
or one who exists only for melee combat is fine.&nbsp; Ignoring the benefits
of a bow for any other reason is ignorant.&nbsp; In any event, how, you
might ask, does one get good with a bow?&nbsp; Well, start early.&nbsp;
I made the mistake of letting my bow skill fall behind, now here I am,
11th level, with a 102 (Master) Fletching skill (trade skills are not limited
by your level) but struggling to get my Archery skill up to my level maximum.&nbsp;
The best way to do this is to go out with the use of the bow as your sole
priority.&nbsp; Bring a good supply of cheap arrows, go into the wilderness,
and pick on monsters that /con blue to you until your skill is maxed out.&nbsp;
Use the tactics discussed above.&nbsp; Even better is to pick on monsters
(like Orcs and Gnolls) that /con green to you, so they will run away.&nbsp;
Then you can start the combat with a few arrows, and end it with a few
more as you follow along behind shooting the hapless creature. Just make
sure you don't use this tactic where the beast runs for help (like in BlackBurrow).&nbsp;
Out of doors is usually a better choice.&nbsp; Archery skill is tougher
than other combat skills to increase because you end up using it less.&nbsp;
You take many more swings in melee than you do shooting, so progress may
be slower than normal.&nbsp; But it's fairly cheap, as arrows only cost
a silver (or less to those with high charisma) each.&nbsp; And remember
to save some money to buy a good bow.&nbsp; Armor and hand weapons are
very important, but I hope I have convinced you that having some sort of
missile weapon on you is equally as important, or at least can make your
career as an adventurer</b>
<br><b>a whole lot easier.</b>
<p><b>Mistress Sabrael, Ranger of Surefall Glade (master fletcher).</b>
<p><b><i>Sabrael smiled as the small group wandered off...she watched them
go, the Warrior with a new bow in his hand, and a new light in his eye...and
she jingled her purse, heavy with newfound platinum...</i></b>
<p><img SRC="iconnew.gif" height=12 width=31><b>Sabreal's Addendum:&nbsp;
Well, it seems Verant has seen fit to allow Paladins to use bows.&nbsp;
Excellent!&nbsp;&nbsp; The more the merrier, I say, and it opens up a whole
new set of customers&nbsp; for my bows.&nbsp; With that in mind, how does
a Paladin go about using a bow?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, everything I have written
about Warriors applies to Paladins as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, I
have taken a look at the Paladin spell lists, and I see at&nbsp; level
22 they get Root.&nbsp; Wow.&nbsp; Reread the section on Rangers above
ifyou can't figure out how to use this spell in conjunction with a bow
for yourself.&nbsp; Of course, if it isn't obvious to you, perhaps you
should consider a new hobby, like, say, coloring with large crayons.&nbsp;
Thinking obviously isn't your game.&nbsp; For those of you who have figured
it out, remember this:&nbsp; Up to level 22, you are a Warrior with some
nice healing abilities and a Bow to dish out some ranged damage.&nbsp;
After level 22, you are a god.&nbsp; Simple enough.&nbsp; Enjoy, and Good
hunting!</b>
