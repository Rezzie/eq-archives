In Halas, there's a cigar shop SE of the Shaman temple called Dok's Cigars.&nbsp;
Talk to Dok inside and he'll mention a cigar, but he has none in inventory.&nbsp;
If you ask him about the cigar, he will relay a story about attempting
to make something he calls cigars, but burning himself all the time, so
he switched to candle making.&nbsp; A few more questions gets you the quest
to go get honeycombs for him to make candles - you get a jar with 6 slots
&amp; combine button.&nbsp; In return, he says he'll give you a 'special
candle'.&nbsp; Your reward is xp, plat and the <a href="../equipment/graphics2/Everburn_Candle.htm">Everburn

For those of&nbsp; you working on that complete set of patchwork, she sometimes
gives the pieces that are not available to tailor.&nbsp; Faction for Merchants
of Halas, Wolves of the North and Shamen of Justice goes up and Rogues
of the White Rose goes down.&nbsp; She is also looking for Wrath Orc wristbands
and says she will give Raw-hide tunic, leggings or leather gloves if you
return 2 such wristbands to her.&nbsp; (Submitted by Juntao)</b>

Qeynos isn't the only place with and NPC who hates gnolls enough to pay
for their fangs.&nbsp; Lysbith McNaff in the pit of Doom&nbsp; will give
you rations, money and experience for each gnoll tooth you give her. (you
may have to give her three at a time now).&nbsp; Almost makes that dental
degree worthwhile.&nbsp; Giving teeth to Lysbith Mcnaff raises your faction

<p><a NAME="The Langseax"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Langseax:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest to obtain the <a href="../equipment/graphics3/Langseax.htm">Langseax</a>
or the <a href="../equipment/graphics4/Langseax_of_the_Wolves.htm">Langseax
of the Wolves </a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete Version: Go to Renth McLanis in
the tavern across from Mac's Kilts.&nbsp; Ask him "What dangerous matter?".&nbsp;
He tells you of a crime.&nbsp; Agree to hunt the murderer.&nbsp; Renth
then sends you to see Dok in Dok's Cigars.&nbsp; Find out all you can about
the crime.&nbsp; He tells you to go see the leader of Clan McMannus.&nbsp;
This is the fishing village located in West Karanas.&nbsp; Speak to the
leader.&nbsp; Then speak to Ulrich McMannus and he tells you Frostbite
can track prey if he has a piece of sweaty clothing. Return to Dok and
ask him "Where is the sweaty shirt?".&nbsp; He then tells you he sold it
to Tundra Jack.&nbsp; Find Tundra Jack on the tundra of Everfrost.&nbsp;
He will tell you that Iceberg is using it for a collar and that you can
distract Iceberg with his favorite meal, Lion Delight.&nbsp; Go back to
Halas and speak to Teria O' Danos.&nbsp; Do the lion meat quest (you get
coin and faction as well as the Lion Delight).&nbsp; Once you have Lion
Delight, be sure to bury it lower in your container then your normal food
to prevent it being eaten by you.&nbsp; Take the Lion Delight to Iceberg
and receive the shirt (NO DROP, LORE ITEM) and faction adjustment.&nbsp;
Now run to the village and give the shirt to Frostbite. (NOTE: Frostbite
will wait for the murderer to spawn before he takes off.&nbsp; He walks
pretty fast so I wouls strongly suggest that you have Spirit of Wolf on
you.&nbsp; It also helps to have a party member along that can track because
I lost sight of Frostbite many times and have had to start over.&nbsp;
Also, Frostbite likes to fight things along the way. Help him out.&nbsp;
Be very careful not to target Frostbite by accident!) Frostbite will lead
you right to the criminal. The murderer will be either Paglan or Basil.&nbsp;
Paglan is tougher to kill and probably in his low to mid 20's, Basil is
around level 20.&nbsp; Kill whomever the dog leads you to, hope he drops
a Barbarian head and then return to Halas with the head. Give the head
to Renth for faction, coin, and of course, the Langseax (if you have Basil's
head) or the Langseax of the Wolves (if it is Paglan's head).&nbsp; I am
not sure what triggers which criminal you get or even if you can just kill
both and get both heads, but it seems that you wil normally get Basil.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Short Version:&nbsp; Run to village, and receive the lion meat.&nbsp; Run
to Halas, turn in meat to Teria and get Lion Delight, faction, exp. and
coin. Run to Iceberg, give Lion Delight, receive shirt, faction, exp. Run
to Frosbite, give shirt, gain exp. Kill the criminal. Return head for faction,
coin, exp and Langseax.&nbsp; (Submitted by Joril Stoutbear, Waladen and
Hance)</b>
<p><a NAME="Lion Meat"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Lion Meat:</font>&nbsp;
This quest is also a part of the Langseax quest.&nbsp; If you talk to one
of the merchants outside the city before the lake, you can get a quest
to get lion meat from the fishing village.&nbsp; Talk to Einhorst McMannus
in the barbarian fishing villiage in Western Karanas.&nbsp; He will refer
you to a female barbarian nearby to get the meat.&nbsp; You must say to
her "I will deliver the Lion Meat Shipment to Halas".&nbsp; You get some
minor coin for this quest.&nbsp; A good idea is to combine this quest with
the note to Einhurst quest since they both go to the same place.&nbsp;

Merchants of Halas increase;&nbsp; Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition of
Tradefolk and Ebon Mask decrease.&nbsp;&nbsp; This quest can only be performed
by lower level characters.&nbsp; A good idea is to combine this and the
