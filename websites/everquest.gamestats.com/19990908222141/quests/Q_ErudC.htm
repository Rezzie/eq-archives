<p><a NAME="Blurred Map (Q)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Blurred Map:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tabure Ahendle, by the arena in Qeynos, is concerned about a map her apprentice
had on him when he was shipwrecked while crossing over from Erudin.&nbsp;
It is possible that you will have to perform another quest before she tells
you this information.&nbsp; On the island in Erud's crossing, you can kill
zombie sailors who will occasionally drop a blurred map.&nbsp; Give this
to her for some coin, xp and a minor item.</b>
<p><a NAME="Kerran Beetle Eyes"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Kerran
Beetle Eyes:</font>&nbsp; (All Classes)&nbsp; This quest is initiated in
Neriak.&nbsp; An NPC in the Necromancer Guild will ask you to venture to
far away Kerra Island on the continent of Odus and collect beetle eyes
for him.&nbsp; If you choose to accept this rather onerous task, you will
get a box which you need to fill with eyes, combine and return for experience
and a small reward.&nbsp; The beetles are located on the island with the
Kerran village in Erud's Crossing.&nbsp; Be aware that the local Kerrans
don't take kindly to your killing their beetles. (Submitted by Lord Vormulak)</b>
<p><a NAME="Zombie Flesh (EC)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Zombie Flesh:</font>&nbsp;
A guild trainer upstairs from the Deepwater Knights guild in Erudin will
ask you to fill a bag with zombie flesh. She gives you a large bag in which
you can put the zombie flesh and tells you that the zombie flesh can be
found near erud's crossing.&nbsp; Kill zombie sailors on the island to
harvest their flesh.&nbsp; This takes a pretty high level to survive.&nbsp;
If you want, you can buy 4 zombie skins from the cat merchant, but you
won't get your money back that way.&nbsp; Combine the bag and return it
to the trainer for experience, faction and a minor item.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Buju)</b>
