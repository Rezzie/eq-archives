<p><a NAME="Cromil's Remains (SK)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Cromil's
Remains:</font>&nbsp; This quest is sometimes given to you after you return
4 bone chips to the paladin in the guild hall in Kaladim. He will ask you
to find the remains of his brother Cromil.&nbsp; Supposedly he is now undead
and is with an undead army located somewhere in the Plains of Karana.&nbsp;
You can find these remains in the Southern Plains of Karana.&nbsp; Cromil
is not actually a creature that is listed.&nbsp; It turns out that after
you kill a Putrid Skeleton in the camp where Lord Grimrot hangs out, one
of them might have a set of Dwarven Bones. These are in fact Cromil's remains.&nbsp;
Upon returning them to the paladin in the Kaladim guildhall, he rewards
you with some cash and a spell.&nbsp; Be warned that the location is in
a very dangerous location, as many of the creatures there are well into
the upper teens in level.&nbsp; Especially beware of the roaming cyclops
and Lord Grimrot, who is in fact the subject of another quest.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Klythin)</b>
<p><a NAME="Lord Grimlot's Love (SK)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Lord
Grimlot's Love:</font>&nbsp; This quest no longer results in the Electrum-Bladed
Wakizashi.&nbsp; I am not sure what if anything you get for this.&nbsp;
Lord Grimlot tells you about his poor, misguided beloved Arlena, who has
run away from him to Mistmoore castle.&nbsp; Being the sentimental type,
he wants you to track down the lass, kill her and return her either the
lute of the gypsy or her bones.</b>
<p><a NAME="Monks of the Whistling Fist"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Monks
of the Whistling Fist:</font>&nbsp; It is likely that you need to be a
tailor to do this.&nbsp; Brother Qwinn in Southern Karana seeks the return
of the code of the whistling fist, which was stolen by him. It is dropped
by Targin the Rock, a rare spawn in the Sol B throne room.&nbsp; Bring
him the Code and a purple silent fist headband and you will get a special
needle.&nbsp; Brother Zephyl in Rathe Mountains wants the Idol of Zan Fi,
which is in the possession of Brother Raster, who spawns in the Mino Elders
room in Lower Guk. Returning this Idol, plus a red sash, results in an
unknown item, which is probably a special tailoring pattern.&nbsp; These
two items supposedly need to be combined with a swatch of shadow silk (tailored)
and a Scroll of Jonathans Whistling Warsong, which is bought from the Bards
Guild to make a brand new monk item.</b>
<p><a NAME="Trumpy Irontoe's Skull"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Trumpy
Irontoe's Skull:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; After bringing the head of Trumpy Irontoe
to the Necro Guildmaster in Qeynos, he will cast a spell on it and hand
you back his fleshless skull to deliver to Lord Grimrot, who is supposed
to be in a field of skeletons somewhere in the Plains.&nbsp; Grimrot is
located in South Karana, surrounded by some tough and dangerous skeletons.&nbsp;
You may have to wait a while for him to show up so be prepared to fight
or hide.&nbsp; The delivery of the skull will get you a decent amount of
experience and gold, as well as an occasional nice item.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Bathory).</b>
<p><a NAME="Winds of Karana"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Winds of Karana:</font>&nbsp;
This is another of the multiple part quests. When heading into Southern
Karana, from Northern Karana mind you, there is a tower just before the
bridge. Just outside the tower doors are four very large horn like structures.
Standing beside one is a female bard. If you talk to her, and ask if there
is anything you can do for her, she relays a sad story of a hermit who
stole her flute. Now, head into Southern Karana. Head straight south, making
sure to give a wide berth to the Grave Yard of Lord Grimrot. About half
way through the zone is a fountain, with Vhalen standing there. Vhalen,
who is also the object of the broken Lute quest for bards, has an offer
for you. He will complete his latest masterpiece for you. Of course, he
needs something for this. Two sheets of a song. Pages 1 and 2 of the Winds
of Karana. He tells you of a man who has stolen these pages. A vile man
of a Hermit. Sound familiar eh? Now, head southeast till you see a cottage.
It has a hexagonal wall of stone surrounding it, so it's not hard to find.
Inside the walls is "a hermit." A very unfriendly sort. Here's where the
quests takes one of two paths. The door to the hermits house is either
locked, or broken and won't open. So it's hard to get to him. If you slide
past the door slowly you may be able to see him and target him. Now, if
you want to talk to him, you can go behind the house, stand EXACTLY against
the chimney that protrudes and banter with him. He's very hard to convince
to talk, and the sentence basically has to say something to the effect
of "where is the flute" though this isn't the exact wording, (I got it
right once out of 6 attempts) Now, if you do talk to him, he has twoquests
you can achieve from him (More on these later) in which you kill two people
and bring proof to him for the Flute and the Page. Now, as it's hard to
get through the door, and thus hard to exchange the items to him, there
is ONE other manner to do this quest. Target him, as before, and begin
an attack. Spells will draw him out just fine. After he is dead, his body
will contain the Flute, Page 1 of the Winds of Karana or just one or the
other. At this point, some factions will go up, down and you will no doubt
gain some good experience. I estimate him to be around level 20. Now, head
back into Northern Karana, and hand the flute over to the bard sitting
against the pillar. She, as thanks, will give you Page 2 of the winds of
Karana, some experience, faction and occasionally a small cash reward.
You</b> <b>are almost complete. Head back into Southern Karana and hand
both the pages to Vhalen at the same time. You will gain Faction, a small
amount of money, and a Bard song. This song appears to be random. I got
the 3rd song, another got the 4th song.&nbsp; (Submitted by Myen).</b>
