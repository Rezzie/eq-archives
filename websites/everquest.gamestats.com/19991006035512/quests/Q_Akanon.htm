you complete the Series C Quest, Mantik gives you a 27C Blackbox and 10
copper to take to Jogl Doobraugh who is in one of the windmills.&nbsp;
He then gives you a note to take to the merchant Drekon Vebnebber in the
warriors guild.&nbsp; These factions will change when you give the black

worse.&nbsp; These factions will change when you take the report to Drekon:&nbsp;
King Akanon, Merchants of Akanon and Gem Choppers standing gets better;
Dark Reflection standing gets worse.&nbsp; The quest FORKS at this point.
There is MORE THAN ONE report you can get from Jogl.&nbsp; The quest you
get from returning the report depends on which one Jogl gives you.&nbsp;
You will either get the Red 5 quest or the Duster Models quest.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Cargo Clockwork"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Cargo Clockwork:</font><font color="#000000">
This may be broken.&nbsp; Jarah Reskar in the Gem Choppers Hall will tell
you that the Cargo Clockwork goes from Ak'Anon to the windmills every five
days at 8 am.&nbsp; A group of 3 highwaymen (it is rumored that one is
Bugglegup) have been attacking it.&nbsp; A reward is offered for the bandits'
heads.&nbsp; Zondo Hyzill in Steamfont is standing next to the Cargo Clockwork.&nbsp;
He does make his trip every 5 days from where he normally is to the windmills.&nbsp;
He gets a little fix there from one of the gnomes.&nbsp; Then, he starts
on his way back to his normal sitting spot.&nbsp; He gets about 1/4 of
the way back, he does a few circles, then disappears.&nbsp; When you go
to look for him, he is back at his starting post.&nbsp; Not sure what to
do after that.&nbsp; (Submitted by Doriath)</font></b>
<p><a NAME="Duster Models"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Duster Models:</font>&nbsp;
This is sometimes given after you complete the 27 C Blackbox quest.&nbsp;
If Jogl doesn't give you the Red V report, he will probably give you the
Duster Model report.&nbsp; If you give this to Drekon Vebnebber in the
Gemchoppers Hall, he will tell you that two of the obsolete Duster Models
have escaped and must be destroyed.&nbsp; You must give the proof to Sanfyrd
Montop.&nbsp; He's the guy that's on the other side of the river from the
Mines of Malfuntion.&nbsp; If you kill a Duster Model, you will get a piece
of scrap metal and sometimes a gizmo/servo type item. You have to give
two pieces of scrap metal (but not the other stuff) to Sanfyrd to complete
the quest.&nbsp; I got a gavel the one time I did the quest. I don't know
if it's random or if you always get one. (Stats on the gavel: non-magical
1h blunt, 4 dam, 38 delay, weight 6.5, usable by warriors, clerics paladins,
rangers, shadow knight, druid, monk, bard, rogue, shaman and any race.)&nbsp;
The Duster Model quest is tough because the Dusters appear infrequently
and they move around a lot.&nbsp; To make things worse, once you start
fighting one nearby guides, etc will often 'help' you by killing it.&nbsp;
Of course it won't leave a corpse then.&nbsp; Duster V can sometimes be
seen walking down the path through "the wall" just inside the city entrance
and around the priest of discord area.&nbsp; At a certain point in his
usual path he goes from walk speed to run speed.&nbsp; I have no idea why.&nbsp;
He will eventually run into the palace and vanish if not attacked.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Duster X can sometimes be found near the paddle wheel on the area above
the Mines of Malfunction.&nbsp; He also walks around on the bridges that
go to the small islands in the lake, but he doesn't appear very often.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Gearheart (A)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Gearheart:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
Baxok Curhunter will ask you if you will serve the crown, and once you
are about 5th level he will give you a quest to hunt down a stolen clockwork
named Gearheart who has been taken by the fae in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;
Gearheart is found at&nbsp; the faerie city.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is in&nbsp;
his mid teens (probably around&nbsp; level 15). When you kill gearheart,
you get a faction loss (faerie), some change and a 'blackbox XIVD' which,
when given to Baxok Curhunter, gives you some change, a couple of faction
changes, and an item, possibly a round shield.&nbsp; The quest is worth
a platinum or two.&nbsp; (Submitted by Wael and Toraque)</font></b>
<p><a NAME="The Gnome Take"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Gnome Take:</font>&nbsp;
Tell Jeet in Kaladim that you will run to the gnome city (after doing the
boog mudtoe quest I believe) and say you will collect the gnome take.&nbsp;
He will then give you a key. You have to find a clockwork scrubber in Ak'Anon
which responds to 628 and use the key on him to get the gnome take. The
scrubber was down in the zoo area when I found him and responded by saying
something like wiz... tik... 628... You give him the key and your faction
with clockwork goes up and you get the gnome take. Then you take the gnome
take to Jeet.&nbsp; You get a couple of silver and a minor item for completing
this quest, plus faction and experience.&nbsp; (Submitted by Quegos)</b>
<p><a NAME="Going Postal"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp;
This quest may cover every town in Norrath, as well as some non-town areas.&nbsp;
Listed below are all the towns and contacts I know of.&nbsp; The text to
get the letters or bags is a little confusing. They say something like
[deliver] mail to [Kelethin]. If you say 'I will deliver mail' or 'I will
go to Kelethin' it won't work, only the form of ' I will deliver mail to
Kelethin' seems to work to get the item to deliver. Kelethin, Freeport,
Highhold, and Qeynos are international mail hubs. Delivering mail between
hubs will always result in carrying a mailbag. All other mail origination
sites are satellite postal offices and feed into the nearest major hub.&nbsp;
The reward varies (at whim) between 1gp and 12gp, with values in the middle
more usual. With a couple of deliveries, low-level characters could get
a few platinum easy.&nbsp; Bards with Selo's Accelerando are really in
good shape, as some of these routes can be done in only a few minutes.&nbsp;
The quest is sponsored by the League of Antonican Bards. Faction hits are
League of Antonican Bards, Knights of Truth, and Guards of Qeynos get better,
RingofScale and Mayong Mistmoore get worse. So remember, if you see a wood
elf bard slouching in the shadows in your home town (and it's not Kelethin),
it's just the local postal worker.</b>

This is sometimes given after the 27 C Blackbox quest.&nbsp; If you turn
in the correct report to Drekon you will be told that the "rumors of Red
V must be true".&nbsp; You need to get Red V's blackbox and give it to
Manik.&nbsp; Red V is usually about level 4-6 and spawns in the back part
of the Mines of Malfuntion between midnight and 6am game time. The corridors
leading to and the room in which Red 5 spawns are short, so only small
people(gnomes, dwarves and halflings) can actually fight or cast in there.
Since you have to be standing to cast or attack. The spawning point for
Red 5 alternates between "obsolete model" and "Red 5". Kill all of them,
only red 5 gives the box.&nbsp; Red 5 is killable by solo lvl 8 or bunch
of lvl 5's.&nbsp; If you kill him, his corpse will have an incomplete blackbox.&nbsp;
To fix the blackbox you have to put 4 blackbox fragments in the incomplete
blackbox and hit combine.&nbsp; You can get the blackbox fragments from
the obsolete models that also inhabit the mines.&nbsp; You will usually
only be able to kill Red V once per game day.&nbsp; (And sometimes not
at all if you miss him.)&nbsp; The incomplete blackbox is a quest item
anyway, so you can only carry one.&nbsp; When you combine the 4 blackbox
fragments inside the incomplete blackbox you will get a rusted blackbox.&nbsp;
The rusted blackbox looks just like the ones you get from the rogue clockworks
in Steamfont, but it's actually different.&nbsp; (The other rusted blackboxes
are for a different quest.)&nbsp; If you give Red V's rusted blackbox to
Manik you'll get experience, faction changes, a little money and a random
item.&nbsp; The item is often a piece of cloth armor (hardly worth the
trouble), but sometimes you'll get a potion.&nbsp; If your faction with
then gnomes is high enough or you repeat this quest enough once you complete
the quest you get the </font><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Bullsmasher.htm">Bullsmasher</a></font><font color="#000000">

These are supposedly the four lense locations&nbsp; 1) The gnome royal
observer just outside zone line in Lesser Faydark will give&nbsp; you one
if you ask.&nbsp; 2) The gnome royal observer in one of the observatories

observer in another observatory tells you it was stolen by a Dark Elf female,
Zenita DRin.&nbsp; She is in Freeport in the secret tunnels beneath an
inn by the docks. You can get the lense two ways.&nbsp; Kill her - she
is approximatley level 15 and hard to kill.&nbsp; Or you can play cards
with her (if you have an OK faction with her) by continuously trading her
a bottle of something you can purchase upstairs for a draw of a card until
you manage to draw a King.&nbsp; (This one is confirmed)&nbsp; 4) The final
royal observer in Steamfont tells you his brother, Bidl Frugrin, went to
Kelethin to do some observations with the spare telescope lens.&nbsp; He
says he has likely found the local tavern and has gotten drunk, wandering
the forest by day, and hanging out in the tavern by night.&nbsp; At night,
he can be found in the tavern next to Trueshot Bows in Kelethin and happily
gives you the telescope lens. Take the lenses to Tobon Starpyre and give

that they have been operating within the Ocean of Tears, leagues from their
own territory.&nbsp; The Elemental Grimoire contains the knowledge which
will&nbsp; advance your techniques in research.&nbsp; With it you shall
learn to research spells and scribe them for your own spellbook.</font></b>
