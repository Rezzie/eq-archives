<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Description:
</font><font color="#000000">Halfling
newbie area.&nbsp; This is an excellent zone to hunt up to level 9 or 10,
but after that your options are pretty limited.&nbsp; The zone is split
into two areas, with the true newbie area within the walled area, and the
higher level area (above level 5) beyond the wall.&nbsp; Inside the wall
are the lower level critters such as giant rats, giant bats, snakes, fire
beetles, klaknaks and bixies.&nbsp; Outside the wall are more formidable
creatures and several camps.&nbsp; There are three goblin camps which are
relatively close together and an orc camp which is in the far corner of
the zone.&nbsp; There is also a set of ruins on the hill which usually
only spawn skeletons, but occasionally spawn something nastier.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Because there are several deputies at the wall entrance who will help you
if you get in trouble, it is actually possible for a halfling to start
hunting in this area as low as level 4.&nbsp; The best hunting is the various
goblins.&nbsp; They give good xp, carry rusty weapons, and drop war beads
which can be turned in to the Sheriff for experience, faction and some
money.&nbsp; The three goblin camps are almost always hunted by one or
more groups, but they spawn pretty fast and generally have enough hunting
to keep everyone busy.&nbsp; There are also goblin warriors who just wander
the zone.&nbsp; The biggest danger here is a Goblin named Mooto, who is
close to level 10 and able to cast magic spells.&nbsp; He spawns in one
camp and then wanders around from camp to camp so you cn run into him at
any one of the camps.&nbsp; Probably the best camp of the three is the
one right next to Runnyeye because you get the added advantage of hunting
the two goblin guards who spawn at the Runnyeye entrance and you are close
enough to the zone border to run if you get in trouble.&nbsp; The orc camp
is often not camped since the orcs are more in the 8 to 14 level range
(similar to those in the commonlands) and most people have moved beyond
Misty Thicket by those levels.&nbsp; A note for the big people.&nbsp; While
there are shops near the entrance to Rivervale, the doors are very samll
and you can only duck through them if you maneuver yourself into the perfect
position.&nbsp; However, there is supposed to be one shop to the right
of the entrance to Rivervale where you can shop through the window.</font></b>
