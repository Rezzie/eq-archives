<br><b><font size=+1>URSULA the Barbarian Shaman on Brewing</font></b></center>

<p><b>Well, the Gods have brought great changes to the drinking and brewing
folk of Norrath: Those who were brewing beer for profit are weeping into
our crude steins, and those who enjoyed brewing exotic drinks are dancing
in the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; What used to be the cash crop of brewers, Tujim's
Fierce Brew, now only generates two casks from the five it yielded before.
This means that at no point is brewing beer profitable to sell back to
merchants, and becoming a brew master suddenly got a lot more expensive.
Now, there are only a few items like Kiola juice and Bog Juice that can
be traded to other players who are on quests.&nbsp; Everything else is
cheaper to buy than to make. But there is an up side to what the Gods of
Norrath have cast down upon us:&nbsp; There are at least 3 new brewing
books available in Halas.&nbsp; There are other places that talk about
the quest Thadres Thymes will send you on, so I won't bother you about
that here.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now, I am not much of a researcher. I would much rather smash Gnolls,
Orcs, and Mintaurs than study the effects of Alcohol Tolerance. But from
what I've seen and heard, here is what I can tell you: The higher your
alcohol tolerance is, the faster you recover from being drunk, and the
less the chance is that you get really stupid with each drink. For the
Warrior types,</b>
<br><b>I have yet to see an advantage to getting righteously tanked that
would be worth having in battle. I have heard rumors about faster hit point
regeneration, but I am very skeptical.</b><b></b>
<p><b>But all hope for making money in brewing is not lost. I and other
masters of this holy trade are searching for the ingredients to vodka.
Vodka is listed as an ingredient in the quest books in Halas.&nbsp; And
Ginesh, a combination of a foraged vegetable, water, a shotglass, and a
short beer, is a drink that can improve even a master's skill quite a bit.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In a previous tale, I told of how it took only about 7 platinum to
become a Master Brewer. Sadly, this can no longer be true since Tujim's
will not pay for itself at the mid to higher levels of mastery. But I can
give you the methods to brewing beer that will season you enough to become
a Brew Master.&nbsp; Here it is:</b><b></b>
<p><b>It used to be that brewing supplies were quite rare. Now, I am pretty
sure that the basics are available in at least Freeport, HighHold, and
Qeynos. Anyway, to develop your skills, you want to get a point or two
on brewing and start out with Short beer.&nbsp; Brewing skills are cheap
to develop relative to other skills, so don't waste any extra points on
it.&nbsp; And everyone has</b>
<br><b>the Short Beer recipe, so I won't go into that here.&nbsp; After
that becomes trivial, move on to something a little harder.&nbsp; Like
mead. After that, try making Ale until that becomes trivial. Ale and Tujim's
are brews you definitely want to improve your skills on, because they yield
2 drinks on every success, making it less expensive to develop.&nbsp; Finally,
after Tujim's becomes trivial, start on Ginesh. Ginesh is made of:&nbsp;&nbsp;
foraged vegetable+shotglass+flask of water+short beer. Ginesh, like Ale
and Tujim's, yield 2 drinks. And don't even try to work on this until Tujim's
become's trivial. This is one very tough drink to master.&nbsp; After Ginesh</b>
<br><b>becomes trivial, your skill should be at 168.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway, all this talk is making me thirsty. Time to go back for more
beer!</b>
