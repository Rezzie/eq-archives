am a young shaman".&nbsp; She tells you that she wants Granin O'Gill brought
to justice by bringing her his head.&nbsp; He can be found by the statue
area of Everfrost.&nbsp; Do even try to find him until you are 13th or

same area and will wipe you out fast.&nbsp; He hits hard (20 points a pop)
and casts spells, but he does not have alot of hit points.&nbsp; When you
return his head to Margyn you get faction, exp, a few coppers (joy), and
a 1st rank spell.&nbsp; This quest can only be performed by characters

Guild seeks to find the remains of Ivan McMannus.&nbsp; The only problem
is that he doesn't know where they are.&nbsp; You have to go talk to a
lass named Megan. You can find Megan by asking her dog Snowflake "Where

a hole in the ice where she dropped the remains.&nbsp; This is a dangerous
area to hang around in.&nbsp; Go swimming and kill the first Goblin Diver.&nbsp;
You will get a barbarian rib from the diver.&nbsp; The other three bones
are found on the river bottom.&nbsp; You just have to keep on looking,
day after day.&nbsp; All three bones looked like small bags on the river
floor.&nbsp; They were located between the ice hole and the first goblin
diver.&nbsp; The Items you collect are: Barbarian rib, skull, jaw, and
femur&nbsp; Put them in the box, combine and return them and you will get

<p><a NAME="Tarton's Wheel"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Tarton's
Wheel:</font>&nbsp; This is the quest to get the components for the Wizard
Spell Ice Comet.&nbsp; There are 3 NPC's standing along ice wall near Starn
bearjumpers place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk with the human wizard Sulgar and he
will tell you that he is looking for tartons wheel.&nbsp; He gives you
a glowing case and a tome of hints that spans all over the 3 continents.
The case is to hold the spokes of the wheel and the tome gives you hints
on where to find the pieces.&nbsp; Be aware that the case is a no rent
item and will disappear when you log out, so don't put any rods in it until
you are ready to give them to Sulgar. Tartons wheel apparently lets you
travel through the planes.&nbsp; You combine the pieces you find in the
box and get The <a href="../equipment/graphics4/Staff_of_the_Wheel.htm">Staff
of the Wheel</a> (a 1HB weapon) and the star of eyes (a gem which casts
unlimited identify spells).&nbsp; When you give them to him, he will give
you the runes of frost and astral needed to research the ice comet spell.&nbsp;
(Then pray your research doesn't fail).&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 10 pieces
that you need scattered across the face of Norrath. The names of the 10
rods are: Azia, Beza, Caza, Dena, Ena, Fana, Geza, Heda, Izah, Jaka. Be
aware that the rods spawn very rarely, are no drop items, and are just
laying there for anyone to pick up (They are just called "a rod", and identify
as wizard only) so they will be very difficult to get to in time.&nbsp;
Of course, if you are not a wizard, please leave these rods alone, since,
as a no drop and thus nonsaleable item, they are of no value to anyone
other than a high level wizard on this quest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The locations
are as follows:&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; [azia] On the ocean floor in Eruds Crossing
past the zombie boat where the zombie sailors hang out.&nbsp; (location
- neg 1162, pos 2340); (2) [beza]&nbsp; In the underwater cave in the Everfrost
plains.&nbsp; It is in the "house" all the way back and right in the cave,
where 3 dry bones guard it in the center of the room;&nbsp; (3) [caza]
Lake Rath.&nbsp; Underneath the first island you see is an underwater tunnel
leading to a stone tower.&nbsp; Its on the top floor of the tower. (You
need enduring breath for this one);&nbsp; (4) [Dena] Dagnor's cauldron,
right outside the entrance to Kedge Keep.&nbsp; If you face with your back
to Kedge, it is directly diagagonal left,&nbsp; in a corner.; (5) [Ena]
Lower Guk in the Reanimated hand room. This one is the only one you need
a group for, unless you're brave and kamakazi it. Warning, the floor is
the same color as the rod in this room and it makes it very hard to find
with the hand and the dar beating on you;&nbsp; (6) [Fana] Oasis of Marr
in the underwater tower next to the above ground tower, on the top floor;
(7) [Geza] Highhold Pass in the water near the waterfall closest to the
Tiger Inn.&nbsp; There are 2 waterfalls there.&nbsp; The rod is in front
of the one closest to the inn; (8)&nbsp; [Heda] Qeynos Aqueducts, in the
shark pit;&nbsp; (9) [Izah] Neriak in the water in front of the bar called
"the blind fish".&nbsp; The bar has 4 glass windows that are underwater,
and the rod spawns right in front of those windows; (10)&nbsp; [Jaka] Unrest
in the water outside the right side of the house near where the the gnome
speulunker is.&nbsp; Instead of going into the tunnel that leads to him,
you go a little right of that entrance and there's a very short passage
where you can find the rod.&nbsp; (Submitted by Shaidar)</b>
<p><a NAME="The Vengeful Musicians"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Vengeful
Musicians:</font>&nbsp; There are 3 skeletons wandering everfrost that
are about level 10 - 13: vengeful soloist, vengeful composer and vengeful
lyricist.&nbsp; They carry pages 74, 75 and 76 of Delius Thymes' Diary.
These items are no save, no drop, lore items, so you lose them when you
log out.&nbsp; Give the 3 pages to Delius' sister, Thadres, by the well
in Halas. You get a tiny bit of experience and one of four tomes listing
various brewing recipes.&nbsp; Faction goes up with the corrupt guards
of Qeynos and down with the Guards of Qeynos and Merchants of Qeynos when
you kill the skeletons.&nbsp; (Submitted by Neren Silverwolf)</b>
