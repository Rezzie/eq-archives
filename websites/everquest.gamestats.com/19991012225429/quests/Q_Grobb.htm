The shadow knight guildmaster wants you to collect bone chips for him.&nbsp;
Get four chips,and return them for experience, faction and an item (usually
a rusty 2 handed sword).&nbsp; Your faction for SKN and DarkOnes goes up,
factions FrogloksOfGuk, BrokenSkullClan and DaBashers(?) go down</b>
<p><a NAME="Fire Beetle Eyes"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Fire Beetle
Eyes:</font>&nbsp; In Grobb, talk to Basher Nindan or something similar.
His name doesn't matter, he doesn't move around. Right before the tunnel
to Innothule Swamp is Basher Razbaz. Go past him, away from the tunnel
and Priest of Discord, and there is a small river. Swim along it, and on
the right will be a cage with a Froglok prisoner and a Basher or two. Follow
this area's tunnel to the back, where the correct Basher is. If hailed,
he tells you to bring him 3 Fire Beetle eyes, and he will give you "shinies".&nbsp;
You get a minor gem or jewel for returning the items, and occasionally
a minor magic item (such as a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Brass_Earring.htm">Brass
Earring</a></font>).&nbsp; You also get a positive faction hit with Da
Bashers and a negative faction hit with the Broken Skull Clan. (Submitted

give you a little experience &amp; a rusty 2h battleaxe.&nbsp; You also
get positive faction with Da Bashers and negative faction with the Broken

Pie:</font>&nbsp; Hergror is hungry, and he wants a Fungus Dung Pie (yech).
He says to go to tell Carver Cagrek "Hergror wants his Fungus Dung Pie".&nbsp;
He is the troll on the dias in front of the Shaman's Guild near the bank.&nbsp;
When you talk to Cagrek, he complains that Hergror is always hungry and
that he needs 4 Fungus Spores to make a pie, but not to hit them too hard
or you ruin them.&nbsp; The spores are dropped on a very rare occasion&nbsp;
by fungus spores in Innothule.&nbsp; If you complete this and give Hergror
the pie, he will award you with some patchwork, leather or raw-hide armor.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Hehe Meat"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">HEHE meat:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest to get the <a href="../equipment/graphics/Grobb_Cleaver.htm">Grobb
Cleaver</a>.&nbsp; It starts in Grobb (of course).&nbsp; Talk to Carver,
by the Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat
called "HEHE meat" and the recipe to make it.&nbsp; You can purchase the
meat in Oggok from Dooga the Ogre Chef.&nbsp; (He has a seperate quest
to deliver froglock legs).&nbsp;&nbsp; The recipe is held by the Gobbler
in Neriak.&nbsp; If you talk to the Gobbler about the recipe, he will send
you to deliver a Grub Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the
Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik.&nbsp; You need to make the delivery.&nbsp; Nerbilik
is fishing on the Siren rocks.&nbsp; Be careful, since I have been told
the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent.&nbsp; Give him
the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased faction
with DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and some xp.&nbsp;
However, he will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so you need to kill
him and loot it from his corpse.&nbsp; This seriously decreases your troll
faction.&nbsp; Then take the recipe and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and
he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for you efforts.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ashrum)</b>
<p><a NAME="Hulkulk's Love"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Hulkulk's
Love:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Be forewarned that this quest
will lower your faction with the dark bargainers.&nbsp; In the Night Keep,
talk to Hukulk.&nbsp; He mentions [Helm of Hukulk], and upon asking him
about the helm, he refers to a Lynuga who broke his heart.&nbsp; Hukulk
asks that you go to Neriak to see who Lynuga meets with, possibly kill
them, and return the head of her lover and the Bracers of Love that he
gave to her.&nbsp; In return, Hukulk will give you an extra Helm of Hukulk.&nbsp;
I am told you need to give him both the bracers and the head (presumably
of Lumpkin) to get the helm.&nbsp; Lynuga can be occasionally found floating
in the water near the entrance to Guk. She won't mention anything about
the [Happy Love Bracers] but if you&nbsp; ask her about them, she will
tell you she gave the ugly things to her boyfriend, Guard Lumpkin, in Neriak
and that the relationship was over.&nbsp; Lumpkin will tell you that Ratraz
now has the bracers.&nbsp; Ratraz is a bouncer in the Maiden's Fury in
Neriak.&nbsp; You have to kill Ratraz. If he runs while your fighting him,
and you're a troll or ogre, be aware that you may have to duck while chasing
him through some of the lower arches in Neriak, so you will have to reclick
your autoattack. I haven't had anyone jump in on that battle yet and I've
let him run pretty far before. From him you will get the happy love bracers
(AC 1 bracers, I'd use them just for the name alone if they weren't so
lousy), his head, and a warclub. Watch out!&nbsp; You do NOT want to give
his head to Hululk! Lumpkin was the one who stole Lyguna from Hulkulk,
not Ratraz! Either put his head in a seperate container or destroy it.&nbsp;
The warclub is a decent non-magic blunt weapon that you can sell for quite
a few plat. Ratraz is about 19th level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you need to get
Lumpkin's head. This is more of a trick. He is found in the Foreign Quarter
of Neriak. He runs around a couple of the back rooms.&nbsp; Attack him
when he is as deep in these rooms as he gets! He is also about 19th and
tries to run when hurt enough. If he gets far enough a high level shadow
knight jumps in and you're basically doomed.&nbsp; From him you get his
head and a rusty halberd.&nbsp; Take his head and the Happy Love Bracer's
back to Hululk to get your prize, the </font><a href="../equipment/graphics/Helm_of_Hukulk.htm">Helm
of Hukulk</a><font color="#000000"> AC5 +3 strength +3 agility, wearable

and Faction.&nbsp; Note about factions. If your standing is too low with
shadowknights (or perhaps if you are not a troll shadowknight), you will
get nothing for turning in the quest items to Hulkulk. (Submitted by Igjarjuk

<p><a NAME="Skeletons from the closet"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Skeletons
in the closet:</font><font color="#000000"> If you go into the Shaman's
Guild and talk to the Shaman upstairs near the throne (I forget his name),
he talks about the head Shaman, Kallie (?). He says she hates him because
he let some skeletons of hers out of the closet and now they're running
around Grobb causing trouble. (funny) Apparently there are several skeletons
running around the city of Grobb. You are supposed to find all of them
and ask them "Come Back to the Closet" and see what they say. There are
four skeletons you need to get.&nbsp; The three that appear in town only
appear one at a time, so you have to do them in order.&nbsp; (1) After
talking to Urako in the Shaman's guild, the first skeleton appears by the
barkeep.&nbsp; Hail him then say "come back to the closet."&nbsp; He will
complain that it is cramped and he just got out but will go back if he
had a pair of Oven Mitts.&nbsp; These are acquired by giving Cleaver Cagrek
3 froglok meat and 10gp.&nbsp; Give him the mitts and he then becomes a
skull item (lore, no drop) in your inventory called "The Baker."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(2)&nbsp; Once the gloves are given to the 1st skel, he will say something
about Basher Nanrum knowing where "The Butcher" is and to ask him [wheres
the skeleton].&nbsp; When you ask Basher Nanrum [wheres the skeleton],
he tells you that the Butcher skeleton is right by Cleaver Cagrek (which
he is).&nbsp; "The Butcher" will say he wants an Ogre Butcher Apron to
go back to the closet.&nbsp; To get the Butcher Apron, you have to speak
to Chef Dooga in Oggok, and give her 3 pickled froglocks and 10 gold.&nbsp;
The problem for trolls is that Chef Dooga is KOS to trolls.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To get around this, create a newbie ogre to get the apron and give it to
your Troll or get an Ogre friend to get it for you.&nbsp; Give it to the
skeleton and he will become a skull item called "the butcher".&nbsp; (3)
The next skeleton is The Captain.&nbsp;&nbsp; He only appears at night,
doesn't always appear, and is very hard to find (loc&nbsp; - 1617 , 773).&nbsp;
He wants a ship in a bottle.&nbsp; You can buy this either on an island
in the middle of the Innothule Swamp or from the bartender who stands next
to Chef Dooga.&nbsp; The Ship in a Bottle is no drop, so you have to get
it yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you try to get it from the bartender, you will
need a guise of the deceiver mask or an illusion spell of some sort.&nbsp;
(4)&nbsp; The final skeleton is The Minstrel.&nbsp; He wants four lizardman
scout fifes, which are dropped by lizardman scouts.&nbsp; When you turn
in all four skulls, you get a <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Kaglari_Mana_Doll.htm">Kaglari
Mana doll</a> , which is probably not worth all of the stuff you gave up
to get it.&nbsp; (Submitted by Itchyfish, Grobbie and Eolith).</font></b>
<p><a NAME="Spore Guardian"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Spore Guardian:</font>&nbsp;
This quest is also given by Hulkulk's assistant in the Shadowknight Guild.&nbsp;
You have to get the head of the Spore Guardian.&nbsp; The Spore Guardian
spawns in the Innothule swamp, and it's corpse sometimes has a "Huge Mushroom
Head".&nbsp; Giving the mushroom head to the the correct troll in the SK
guild hall will get you a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Froglock_Skin_Mask.htm">Froglok
