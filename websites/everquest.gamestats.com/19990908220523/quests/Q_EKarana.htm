<p><a NAME="The Clothspinner Sisters"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The
Clothspinner Sisters:</font>&nbsp; You will occasionally see an NPC running
around outside the gates whose last name is Clothspinner.&nbsp; Knowledge
of this quest is still developing, but here are the basics.&nbsp; Talk
to her and hear her tale of woe.&nbsp; She will tell you that she misses
her warrior sister, and will give you a letter to deliver to her sister
somewhere in the Karanas.&nbsp; The sister is located in East Karana in
a cave.&nbsp; Deliver the note to her, and she will thank you and give
you a monogrammed cloth to take back to her sister.&nbsp; She will then
be rewarded for talking to you by being attacked by a guard and killed.&nbsp;
Bet that makes you feel good.&nbsp; If you kill the guard and the sister
lives, she also gives you a veil to give to the sister.&nbsp; When you
give the original sister the cloth she will send you with a note to the
Temple of Life.&nbsp; If you give her the veil, you get a decent item as
well.&nbsp; There you may or may not be rewarded, depending it seems upon
your alignment and religion.</b>
<p><a NAME="Milea Clothspinner (EK)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Milea
Clothspinner:</font>&nbsp; A Cleric Guildmaster at the shrine of Bertoxxulous
tells you about the dalliance between Commander Kane and Milea Clothspinner.&nbsp;
He wants her eliminated.&nbsp; Venture to Eastern Karanas to the cave where
Milea makes her home, do her in, and return with proof of her death for
faction and experience.&nbsp; Be forewarned that this quest will not make
you friends with Commander Kane.&nbsp; (Submitted by Bathory)</b><b></b>

Morgan's Armor:</font>&nbsp; At the zone border of Eastern Karana, by the
qeynos road marker is a knight, sir morgan, and his squire.&nbsp; Sir Morgan
needs money to upkeep his rusty armor.&nbsp; Give him 5 gold and you will
get experience, a random piece of patchwork, and more rarely a random piece
of damask</b>
