<p><a NAME="Bandages for Honeybugger"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bandages
for Honeybugger:</font>&nbsp; The Honeybugger brother's hand is hurt because
he was swarmed by bixies while seeking honeycombs for his employer.&nbsp;
Give him a bandage, and he'll thank you with some XP and the following
faction:&nbsp; Merchants of Rivervale, Deep pockets, Guardians of the Vale
and Mayor Gubbin get better and Coalition of Tradesfolk III get worse.</b>
<p><a NAME="Bug Collection (MT)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bug Collection:</font>
(All Classes)&nbsp; Blixkin Entopop roams the inside of the wall and has
an unusual hobby.&nbsp; He collects bug parts, and you are just the halfling
to help him out. Talk to him and ask him about the bug collection, and
he will give you a list of six bug parts and a box to collect them in.
The six bug parts for this quest are:&nbsp; Spiderling eyes,&nbsp; spiderling
silk, Fire beetle eyes, Giant scarab egg sac (note: although there are
a few giant scarabs in Misty Thicket, they're rare. I suggest getting them
somewhere else), Giant fire beetle leg (these are found in the Western
Karanas and sometimes on the queen klacknak),&nbsp; and Giant wasp wings
(these are found in Misty Thicket and camped heavily; the only other place
to get them is on Crookstinger in Lesser Faydark).&nbsp; After collecting
the items, hit combine and give the box back to him, along with the list
he gave you, for your reward.&nbsp; Among the rewards he gives are a silver
bracelet, a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Bracelet_of_Beetlekind.htm">Bracelet
of Beetlekind</a></font>, a vial of <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Spider_Venom.html">Spider
Venom</a></font> and a <a href="../equipment/graphics3/Potion_of_Poison_Warding.htm">Potion
of Poison Warding</a>, so it is generally a worthwhile quest.&nbsp; you
will also get the following faction changes:&nbsp; Merchants of Rivervale,
Deeppockets, Guardians of the Vale, and Mayor Gubbin all get better, and&nbsp;
Coalition of Tradefolk III gets worse.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ryanne and Abbalar)</b>
<p><a NAME="Eye of Stormguard:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Eye of Stormhammer:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest for the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Avenger_Battle_Axe.htm">Avenger
Battle Axe</a></font>.&nbsp; After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner
clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard.
He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High
Pass keep.&nbsp; Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you
part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other
part, the "Emerald Shard".&nbsp; Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in
Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to
you if you do a small favor.&nbsp; Apparently a bounty hunter by the name
of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he
will give you the emerald.&nbsp; Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!&nbsp; He hops around
between the Orc camp and the wall.&nbsp; You may have to talk to Bronin
to get him to spawn.&nbsp; If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore
item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Frogloks
of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.&nbsp;
When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the
emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you a key
to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.&nbsp; The key is labeled H.K.106.
Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the
following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of
River Vale gets worse.&nbsp; When you turn in the key in highpass bank,
you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the
following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson
McCabe all get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronin also says "There is a [second
Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."&nbsp; Upon
further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare,
and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.&nbsp; In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about
the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The
only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting
"at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to
Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his
brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone
to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.&nbsp; Faldor Hendrys
is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front
gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to
kill him to get the gem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine the parts and you get the
eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speach about how wonderful
a warrior you are and says he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed
by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite."&nbsp; He then will give
you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.&nbsp;
It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with him to get
the axe. (Submitted by Sheba and Erondil and Bertran Headbasher)</b>
<p><a NAME="Honeybugger Assasin:"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Honeybugger
Assasin:</font>&nbsp; Paziu Puno (rogue guild neriak) wants Lil Honeybugger
dead and promises a "king's reward" for her head.&nbsp; She lives in Misty
Thicket in the Halfling territory just outside of town.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
she rooms with her big brother Joogl Honeybugger who never seems to leave
her side, and he is probably around level 10 or so.&nbsp; Since you need
to be below this level to get the quest, you had better get some help in
killing her.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you kill Lil, she drops a halfling head (which
is what you're supposed to bring back to Paziu Puno for your "kings reward"),
a bandage (so you can reverse the faction hit you take from killing Lil
by giving it to Joogl later), and a Case of Jum Jum Juice (lore item)(which
I guess you can give to the treant).&nbsp; Here's where this quest gets
funny.&nbsp; After sneaking/hiding through Rivervale and making the run
back to Neriak, you need to give the halfling head to Paziu Puno.&nbsp;
He then tells you something to the effect of "Foolish young elf. This was
no contract from King Naythox.&nbsp; I wanted Lil Honeybugger killed before
she gave birth to my child.&nbsp; Only a naive dark elf would set foot
in Halfling territory.&nbsp; Here's your great reward, garbage from other
guild exploits."&nbsp; You get some exp,&nbsp; a few cp, a minor item,
and the usual rogue dark elf faction hits (better with Ebon Mask, worse
with guards of qeynos, guardians of the vale, and wolves of the north).&nbsp;
Never trust a dark elf.&nbsp; (Submitted by Thaylon)</b>
<p><a NAME="Honey Jum"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Honey
Jum:</font>&nbsp; Lil Honeybugger and her brother can be found in a lone
house in the Misty Thicket.&nbsp; Talk to Lil, and ask her about&nbsp;
the [Honey Jum Recipe].&nbsp; She'll direct you to an NPC in Rivervale
who owns the Herb Jar. (Just to the right of the Fool's Gold.)&nbsp; This
NPC will tell you&nbsp; that she does, indeed, make Honey Jum, but not
for free!&nbsp; You must bring her 3 honeycombs and 5 gold.&nbsp; Honeycombs
are frequently found on Bixies and Bixie Drones.&nbsp; You receive the
following faction changes:&nbsp; Merchants of Rivervale, Guardians of the
Vale, Deep Pockets and Mayor Gubbin get better, Coalition of Tradesfolk
III gets worse.</b>
