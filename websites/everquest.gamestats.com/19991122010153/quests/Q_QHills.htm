<p><a NAME="Cheslin's Illusion Cards (QH)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Cheslin's
Illusion Cards:</font>&nbsp; Follow the guard Cheslin around and pick up
his illusion cards for some experience and gold.&nbsp; You will probably
have to keep him from getting killed by the wandering creatures in order
to get all his cards, since he is a total wimp who can get beat up by a
rat (or at least a bear).&nbsp; The cards he drops are Chrono Cyclone,
Diamond Vale, Ebon Lotus, and Library of Erudin.&nbsp; You must give him
all 4 cards to get anything. (Or alternately, there is a collector in Freeport
seeking 14 rare Illusion cards, including the four Cheslin drops - see
Freeport quests).&nbsp; After giving back Guard Cheslin his four illusion
cards, he'll give you experience and a bit of cash.&nbsp; He will also
give you a note to his father in South Qeynos named Chesgard (He's near
the Order of Thunder). After you give him the note, he'll thank you and
you'll get a larger amount of experience and a nice item.</b>
<p><a NAME="Gnasher's Head (QH)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Gnasher's
Head:</font>&nbsp; This quest starts in Surefall Glade.&nbsp; Talk to Larsk
Juton who has some sort of feud with a gnoll named Gnasher.&nbsp; Too lazy
to do it himself I guess, he wants you to kill his enemy for him.&nbsp;
This gnoll occasionally appears in Qeynos Hills and is around level 10
or so.&nbsp; Kill him and bring his head back to Lars and you will get
some cash and the Blackburrow Brewers Quest (Surefall).&nbsp; Sometimes
when you kill Gnasher Furrgutt, he is carrying a note from the bartender
at Fish's Ale which you can turn in to the authorities. First, give the
note to Larsk Juton (the same person you give Gnasher's head to).&nbsp;
Note that you cannot shortcut this by giving the note to Captain Tillian
directly. He will give you some experience and a faction adjustment, and
advise you to take the note to Captain Tillian in the Arena in Qeynos (the
same one you give Gnoll Fangs to). Captain Tillian will give you more experience,
more faction adjustments, and a Medal of Merit (a Lore Item which gives
you +5 Charisma) for your good deeds. He will then summon the Executioner,
who will proceed to Fish's Ale to carry out the sentence of death pronounced
on the unwise bartender.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the executioner and watch the
fun.&nbsp; Another note.&nbsp; If you are carrying gnoll fangs for Captain
Tillian, give them to him and go collect the blackburrow stout&nbsp; first,
since the executioner will kill your stout connection and he won't respawn
for a while.&nbsp; (Submitted by Shendar)</b>
<p><a NAME="The Gnoll Slayer"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Gnoll Slayer:</font>&nbsp;
Marton Sayor in the cottage in Qeynos Hills is concerned about the safety
of his infant son.&nbsp; He says he will give you the gnoll slayer long
sword if you help him.&nbsp; Marton mentions a named gnoll named Lord Elgnub
who speaks common tongue, and has threatened his family.&nbsp; Well, Lord
Elgnub can occasionally be found wandering around blackburrow.&nbsp; He
looks like a Splitpaw Gnoll and is approximately level 20.&nbsp; If you
kill him you will get a lore/no drop item Baby Joseph Slayer.&nbsp; Take
the baby back to his father and the grateful man will give you a <a href="../equipment/graphics5/Gnoll_Slayer.htm">Gnoll
Slayer</a> sword, which is a 1H slashing, 6/28 lore weapon.&nbsp; Not altogether
exciting, but he mentions something about the true potential of the sword.&nbsp;
If you inquire further, he mentions there was once an enchantment placed
upon a gnolls eye which was embedded in the sword that gave the sword powers
to protect against disease and call forth a wolf to fight for you. (Sounds
like the scimitar of the Mistwalker).&nbsp; He then says this eye has been
stolen, along with the only book that can restore the enchantment and eye
to the sword.&nbsp; The thief is a great, one-eyed, white gnoll.&nbsp;
He provides no further information and says he's been hunting for this
gnoll for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by Durgo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Jaggedpine Crook Staff"></a><b><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Jagged_Pine_Crook_Staff.htm">Jaggedpine
Crook Staff:</a></font>&nbsp; This quest starts in SureFall Glades.&nbsp;
This quest will not work with too high of a character.&nbsp; Talk with
Corum Finisc, just outside the Jaggedpine of SureFall Glades. After some
keywords, he will mention [crook].&nbsp; This is a Jaggedpine crook staff
that is broken in pieces in Qeynos Hills.&nbsp; Only Gnoll Hunters have
the parts.&nbsp; The gnoll hunters are very rare and getting the staff
pieces is difficult.&nbsp; However, once you have both, go back to Corum
Finisc and he will assemble them for you.</b>
<p><a NAME="The Millers"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Millers:</font>&nbsp;
The Miller siblings, Baobob and Chandra, will make bearhide and wolfhide
armor for you if you provide them with the proper pelt and some gold.&nbsp;
Just talk to them and follow their instructions.&nbsp; Baobob makes the
wolfhide armor (Wofskin Belt [AC 3], Wolfskin boots [AC 4] and <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics4/Wolf_Hide_Cape.htm">Wolfhide
Cape</a></font>) and Chandra makes bearhide armor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra
Millers' prices for bearhide armor are as follows:&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Bearhide_Belt.htm">Bear
Hide Belt</a></font> - 5 GP and Low quality Bear pelt;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Bearhide_Boots.htm">Bear
Hide Boots</a></font> - 15 GP and Medium quality bear pelt;&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Bearhide_Cape.htm">Bear
Hide Cape</a></font> - 21 GP and High quality bear pelt.&nbsp; This also
raises faction with Karana Residents, Guards of Qeynos, Priests of Life
and Knights of Thunder.&nbsp; Be aware that you need to have a high faction
with the Karana Residents to get anything made other than a belt.</b>
<p><a NAME="Rat Ear Pie"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Rat Ear Pie:</font>&nbsp;
Rephas is a crazed hermit who lives near the lake in the Qeynos Hills,
with a penchant for rat ears. If you give him regular rat ears he will
grill them for you, and you get a lore item 'Grilled Rat Ears' which are
also edible.&nbsp; Give that back to him and you get a minor item and some
faction and experience.&nbsp; If you give him 3 giant rat ears he will
give you a recipe for Rat Ear Pie which does not require a clump of dough
(Giant Rat Ears + Baking Spirits + Cup of Four in a mixing bowl, then bake
result in an oven). This rat ear pie can then be used in the Paw of Oppola
quest.&nbsp; (Submitted by Malqanar)</b>
<p><a NAME="Steel Warrior Initiation"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Steel
Warrior Initiation:</font>&nbsp; Go to Brin Stolunger in Warriors Guild
S. Qeynos, tell him you are a [young steel warrior]. He will give you a
ten slot arena sack and tell you to collect 5 bat wings and 5 snake scales
and combine them inside to create a full sack.&nbsp; When you give it back
to him, you get a few copper, xp, faction and a note that you are to take
to Axe Broadsmith in Qeynos Hills. (He's in the hut by the pond)&nbsp;
When you give him the note, he will tell you to kill the [strange skeleton]
across the pond.&nbsp; When you kill it, bring it's skull to him as proof,
and you'll get more coppers, xp, faction and a letter of recommendation
to take back to Brin Stolunger.&nbsp; When you return to Qeynos and give
the letter to Brin, you get MORE coins, xp, faction, and another note.&nbsp;
This one you take downstairs to the animal pits below the arena, and give
it to Grahan Rothkar who tells you it's time for your Final Test. He will
give you a key to open one of the animal pens so you can enter and fight
a young lion. When you kill the young lion, bring it's pelt and meat to
Grahan and you'll get MORE copper, xp, faction and&nbsp; TADA... Strongbear
Bracers.&nbsp; They're magical, AC 1, Agil +1, warrior only, any race.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And he welcomes you to the Steel Warriors!&nbsp; (Submitted by Mistabus).</b>
<p><a NAME="Talym Shoontar's Head"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Talym Shoontar's
Head:&nbsp;</font> You must remove the head of the master poacher Talym
Shoontar from his shoulders and return it to your guild. This quest can
be started either when the guy you turn in the regular poachers head to
mentions him (after turning in a poachers head), or directly started by
talking to Hagar Sureshot in Surefall Glade. Talym appears in Qeynos Hills,
somewhere between the cottage, the road marker, and the Guard Tower. He
appears sometime around midnight, although not apparently every day (at
least he hasn't appeared at times I have been waiting for him). However,
he is about lvl 15, and is roughly on par with Dorn B'Dynn, the scourge
of the Northern Desert of Ro.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus, if you attack him in Qeynos
Hills, the guards will attack you.&nbsp; For a safer way to kill him, Shoontar
also occasionally appears in Fish Tavern's back room, where you turn in
the moonstones for gnoll stouts.&nbsp; This may only happen after the executioner
appears following the gnasher's head quest.&nbsp; Another person spotted
Shoontar in Freeport at the docks, so he obviously gets around.&nbsp; You
get money, experience and an item.&nbsp; (Submitted by Vorador)</b>
<p><a NAME="Taxes"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Taxes:</font>&nbsp; (All
Classes)&nbsp; Somewhere in South Queynos you will find on the 2nd floor
of a building a man with a bad cough.&nbsp; After talking to him for a
bit, he will tell you that he is a tax collecter and needs you to make
his runs for him.&nbsp; He will give you a box, in which to place and combine
the taxes, and a scroll with the names of the people.&nbsp; To get the
taxes from the, simply hail them and say "Please pay your taxes."&nbsp;
Doing this will give you a very small lowering of faction with Qeynos merchants.&nbsp;
Upon going to Mira Sayer, In Qeynos Hills, and asking her to pay, she will
begin to cry.&nbsp; When you ask her why she is crying, she will tell you
a halfling named Flynn something or other stole her tax money.&nbsp; He
is in Crow's Pub in Qeynos.&nbsp; Go to him, hail him, and ask him if he
stole Mira's tax money.&nbsp; He will affirm this, and tell you to say
"I am a gnoll loving weakling and am not worthy to comb your feet" &lt;grin>&nbsp;
After doing so, he will shout it, and the entire zone will here what an
idiot you are.&nbsp; He'll give you the money, combine it, and give it
to the tax man.&nbsp; You'll get a couple silver, a silver stud, and a
<a href="../equipment/graphics3/Brass_Ring.htm">Brass
Ring</a>.&nbsp; A tip for those of you who need an extra way to hold items.&nbsp;
If you keep the tax collection box, you will have a 10 slot box to hold
items, and you can get this as low as level 1.&nbsp; Not bad.</b>
<p><a NAME="The Undead"></a><img SRC="iconnew.gif" height=12 width=31><b><font color="#FF0000">The
Undead:</font>&nbsp; There is a guy by the south wall of the zone named
Niclaus Ressin. He says he was sent by Priestess Jahnda to investigate
reports of the undead in QH. If you ask him 'have you seen any undead'
he will talk about the undead ruins and pulling a torn parchment from a
dead body. If you ask him about the torn parchment, he will give it to
you and ask that you go to qeynos and give it to someone who can decipher
it.</b>
<p><a NAME="Varzoom the Undying:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Varzoom
the Undying:</font>&nbsp; Varsoon of Qeynos Aquaducts and Qeynos Hills
is a high level necromancer, and the target of many high-level players.&nbsp;
Immediately after you kill Varsoon, a Varsoon Zombie will spawn in Qeynos
Hills, who will run in a straight line for the nearest de-spawning site
(so the zombie stays in the zone for less than a minute).&nbsp; The zombie
is called Varsoon the Undying.&nbsp; I am not sure what happens if you
manage to kill the zombie as well.&nbsp; (Submitted by CloudKraken)</b>
