<p><a NAME="The Bloody Shank"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">The Bloody Shank:</font>&nbsp;
Be warned that this quest can really mess with your faction with the deep
pockets.&nbsp; Visit the Captain standing out on a balcony in Highhold
Keep. Hail him and answer his questions.&nbsp; It seems a petty rogue escaped
the dungeon in Highhold Keep but left behind crucial evidence. The rogue's
<a href="../equipment/graphics6/Bloody_Shank.html">Bloody
Shank</a> was sticking out of a guards back! The Captain gives you the
shank to take to the rogue to let the rogue know why you are there to kill
him. The rogue's name is Bronin Higginsbot and he hangs around the Deeppockets
in Rivervale.&nbsp; He may sometimes be found around the southernmost tower
in Rivervale.&nbsp; Hand him the bloody shank and then kill him, but be
careful because a bodyguard sometimes spawns next to him when you hand
him the shank and also the guards will help him if they are nearby. Killing
him lowers faction with Deeppockets,&nbsp; Circle of Unseen Hands, Coalition
of Trade Folk and Carson McCabe and raises it with Merchants of Rivervale.&nbsp;
Return his head for decent money and experience.&nbsp; You will raise faction
with Highpass Guards, Carson McCabe, Merchants of Highpass, Corrupt Qeynos
Guards and Freeport Militia.&nbsp; There is also a rogue named Shayde Higginsbot
on the second floor of the Fool's Gold.&nbsp; When you hand him the bloody
shank he does not give the generic (Thank you.) response. Not sure what
happens if you slay him too.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ebaemnn o' the Rose and
Kozmo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Eye of Stormguard:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Eye of Stormhammer:</font>&nbsp;
This is the quest for the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Avenger_Battle_Axe.htm">Avenger
Battle Axe</a></font>.&nbsp; After returning the clockwork remains (Cleaner
clockwork quest) to Beno Tenarl in Kaladim, ask him about the Eye of Stormguard.
He will give you a letter to give to the Jail clerk near the bank of High
Pass keep.&nbsp; Of course the prisoner has escaped but she does give you
part of the eye of stormguard, as well as info that "Bronin" has the other
part, the "Emerald Shard".&nbsp; Bronin Higginsbot is sometimes found in
Rivervale and sometimes near the southern tower in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
When you ask Bronin about the Emerald shard, he says he will give it to
you if you do a small favor.&nbsp; Apparently a bounty hunter by the name
of Slaythe is after him. He says if you return a piece of his body, he
will give you the emerald.&nbsp; Slaythe is beyond the wall in Misty Thicket.&nbsp;
He appears to be a Froglok (around level 21 or so)!&nbsp; He hops around
between the Orc camp and the wall.&nbsp; You may have to talk to Bronin
to get him to spawn.&nbsp; If you defeat him, you get a froglok leg (lore
item), a few gold, and the following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Frogloks
of Kurnak gets worse and Sarnak, Swamp Giants of Kurnak and Iskar get better.&nbsp;
When you return the froglok leg to Bronin, he tells you that he put the
emerald shard in one of the highkeep stronboxes... and gives you a key
to give to the bank clerk in highpass hold.&nbsp; The key is labeled H.K.106.
Turning in Slaythe's leg provides a little experience, no money, and the
following faction adjustments:&nbsp; Deeppockets, Circle of Unseen Hands,
Coalition of Trade Folk III and CarsonMcCabe get better and Merchants of
River Vale gets worse.&nbsp; When you turn in the key in highpass bank,
you get the emerald shard, about 1 pp in change, some experience, and the
following adjustments: Merchants of High Pass, Highpass Guards and Carson
McCabe all get better.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bronin also says "There is a [second
Emerald Shard] which I hid near Kelethin, you will need it..."&nbsp; Upon
further questioning, you find out that it has been renamed the Gem of Tunare,
and is being held by a guild in Kelethin.&nbsp; In Kelethin, go to the
Scouts of Tunare guild and talk to the guild master there. When asked about
the Gem of Tunare, he tells you that it was stolen by Faldor Hendrys. The
only one who knows where Faldor is, is his brother Elmion who went hunting
"at the lake near the Estate". Well... following this clue brings you to
Dagnor's Cauldron and Elmion at the NPC-camp there. He tells you that his
brother is a thief (and only his half brother btw...) and that he has gone
to Qeynos, probably to work for the thieves guild there.&nbsp; Faldor Hendrys
is a rare spawn in north Qeynos, he can be found walking out the front
gate, and along the road to the Qeynos Hills zone sometimes. You need to
kill him to get the gem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Combine the parts and you get the
eye of stormguard, which gives you +5 magic, cold and fire protection.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you give it to Beno, he gives you a long speach about how wonderful
a warrior you are and says he is giving you a "warrior's true weapon designed
by the ancient stormguard hero, Jendl Mizebrite."&nbsp; He then will give
you the Dwarven Avenger Battle Axe, a very nice warrior only 2HS weapon.&nbsp;
It is likely that you need to have a very high faction with him to get
the axe. (Submitted by Sheba and Erondil and Bertran Headbasher)</b>

stands close to the entrance of the cellars, near the bank.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Library Book (E)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Library Book:</font>&nbsp;
If you go talk to Rarnan Lapice on the top floor of the temple of divine
light in Erudin, he will tell you to fetch a book from the library. This
starts either the library book or Vasty Deep Quest.&nbsp;&nbsp; The librarian
tells you she doesn't have it but that a person on the top floor knows
the person who last checked it out.&nbsp; When you ask him, he tells you
that the person who checked out the book is named Moodoro Finharn and that
he was executed in Qeynos for crimes against the state.&nbsp; He tells
you to go talk to his sister who is in the Erudin Palace.&nbsp; Once there,
she says to meet her just outside the hotel in town to talk to her.&nbsp;
When you meet her, she explains that her brother is still alive.&nbsp;
Her brother is at Crows&nbsp; (It seems he is sick and is in need of some
Erud's Tonic.&nbsp; This is a side quest).&nbsp; Ask him about The Testament
of Vanear.&nbsp; He says yes he has it and will sell it to me for 2 gold.&nbsp;
If you give him the 2 gold he gives you the book which has to inventory
slots and a combine button in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He then laughs and tells
you that a thief stole pages 30 and 34 and the book is worthless without
them.&nbsp; He also says that the thief sold the pages to someone named
Ran.&nbsp; If you then ask him who Ran is he tells you that Ran Flamespinner
is a librarian in Highpass.&nbsp; If you go to Highpass and ask about The
Testament of Vanear he tells you that he did indeed buy page 30 from a
man named Moodoro some time ago but that it was recently stolen by a man
wearing the uniform of a Qeynos guard and that this guard was still in
Highpass, because he could "feel it". He also says that Moodoro also had
page 34 but refused to sell it to him. If you go into highhold pass and
go toward the orc side, you will see a lake or pond or whatever. Jump in
and swim around until you come to a hidden camp of smugglers. Only one
npc there has a name, which is Dyllin Starsine. Kill him and you get page
30 (and you also get a sealed letter which is for the Muffin for Panos
Quest in Freeport).&nbsp; Beware that any smugglers around him will come
to his aid.&nbsp; Faction hits when you kill him are:(-Corrupt Qeynos Guard,
+Guards of Quenos, -Kane Bayle, -Circle of Unseen Hands, -BloodSabers)&nbsp;
The faction hits for him are pretty lagre, so be aware after that of potentially
slipping to KOS in Qeynos.&nbsp; After going back to Qeynos, I went back
to Moodoro and said I want page 34.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said ahh so you figured
out I have page 34 pretty smart of me to rip out the most valuable page
and that it doesn't matter if I get it because the work is fiction anyway.&nbsp;
He then offers to play a game with you for the page. For 4 gold he will
deal you one card and if that one card is a jester he will give you the
page.&nbsp; Along with the jester, you might also draw the King, Queen,
Beggar, or Knight.&nbsp;&nbsp; [Note - keep the Knights and give them to
the dwarf on Eriolissi Island for a reward].&nbsp; Once the whole thing
is combined you get the <a href="../equipment/graphics/Testament_of_Vanear.htm">Testament
of Vanear</a>, which has stats of +10 wis and +10 mana, and is a no drop
lore item.&nbsp; You can keep the testament and use it, or you can return
the testament to Rarnan, who started the quest, for some platinum.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The guards in the keep will reward you for every pickclaw goblin ear you
turn in.</b>
<p><a NAME="Princess Lenia (HH)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Princess
Lenia:</font>&nbsp; In the top of High keep is a Princess Lenya.&nbsp;
The information I have been given on this is confusing, but several people
have told me that it does in fact work.&nbsp; The princess of Felwithe
has been taken prisoner by Carson McCabe (ruler of Highhold Keep).&nbsp;&nbsp;
She would like you to help her escape - a reasonable request.&nbsp; First,
visit a Tearon.&nbsp; He is located near the front of the Keep.&nbsp; Say
"I want to be a hero."&nbsp; Pay close attention to the name of his princess.&nbsp;
Next, seek out the REAL Princess.&nbsp; She is located on the top floor
of&nbsp; Highhold Keep, behind an illusionary picture frame wall at the
top of the stairs.&nbsp; Hail her and give her the bracer you got from
Tearon.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you give it to the Princess (as proof), she says
thanks, vanishes (for about half a second), and you get XP and the following
faction: KingTearisThex (Felwithe King)+, FaydarkChampions+, MayongMistmoore-,
RingofScale-, KingAythoxThex- (???...hmm, could this be continuing somewhere?).&nbsp;
She also gives you the bracer, which is now AC 1 but which still can't
be worn.&nbsp; This is where you need a friend to help you.&nbsp; When
your friend gives the bracer back to Tearon, you get more xp, and this
faction: ClericsofTunare+, KingTearisThex+, Anti-Mage+.&nbsp; The princess
should then appear next to him.&nbsp; Give her the amulet from Tearon she
will thank you and give you a letter to take to Tolon Nurbyte, in the only
inn in Felwithe.&nbsp; Apparantly, the important thing is that the two
people hand over the bracers simultaneously.&nbsp; That is, the moment
the bracer is handed to the princess up stairs, the other bracer has to
be handed to the elf downstairs before she respawns a second later.&nbsp;
If done properly, she'll appear downstairs and stand there for a few minutes.&nbsp;
She won't spawn at all downstairs unless it's done nearly simultaneously.&nbsp;
Since getting the bracers is basically free, I would suggest you keep experimenting
until you get the right combination.&nbsp; Your reward for the bringing
him the letter is a <a href="../equipment/graphics6/Thex_Dagger.htm">Thex
Dagger</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you give the bracer to the fake Princess, in
the basement near the prisoners, she reveals herself to be a dark elf,
and gives the following faction: CarsonMcCabe+, CoalitionofTradesfolk+,
HighpassGuards+, MerchantsofHighpass+, RingofScale-, but no XP.&nbsp; She
then attacks you, so you have better be careful).&nbsp; This quest is not
faction dependent. As long as they will talk to you you are fine.&nbsp;

<p><a NAME="Strongbox"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Strongbox:</font>&nbsp;
The banker in Highpass hold says she will clear out old strongbox accounts
if given the key. The key is gained from an npc named Tallus Holton, who
is located in East Karana.&nbsp; Attacking him also draws his bandit&nbsp;
cronies so I suggest a team approach or a level 25 to 30 individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you kill him, you get a staff segment (a lore item) and a Highkeep Strongbox
Key.&nbsp; When you give her the key she gives you a few gold,a little
experience and a faction adjustment plus one more staff segment.&nbsp;
If you then talk to Lady McCabe on the top floor and she said "hmmm, a
battle staff? It does not ring a bell."&nbsp; There is obviously some way
to combine the staff segments, but this is all I have so far.&nbsp; The
general consensus is that you need to get something from Carson McCabe
to make this work, but nobody has gotten farther than this.&nbsp; It is
also possible that you need to give the segments to Lumi Stergnon in Erudin,
who gives the peacekeeper staff quest (maybe you need to do that quest
first as well), since he mentions a staff that was stolen and taken to
Highpass.</b>
