<br><b>Taking Big Mobs... Enchanter-Style</b>
<br><b>For enchanters level 4 and up</b></center>
<b></b>
<p><b>Being an enchanter in Norrath can be difficult. We don't have big
burn spells like wizards. We don't get smart pets like necros and magicians.&nbsp;
We can't even heal. Some enchanters have said that we need more enhancements
to be an effective class. I say... when used right, with the right tactics
and the right party, our unique abilities are extremely powerful and are
a HUGE asset to a group trying to take out a big mob. Here's a strategy
I've found that allows me and my group to take out mobs that are way too
difficult for other parties our level.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let's say your party finds an area with several baddies in it. Using
ordinary run-in-and-bash tactics, you'd have to fight the whole mob at
once. But with the enchanter's Soothe and Mesmerize spells (or Lull, Enthrall,
etc. depending on your level), you can fight them one or two at a time.
I like to think myself as the traffic cop of the party-I tell the monsters
when to STOP, and when to GO.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Okay, so your group has staked out the area you want to take. There
are 3-6 baddies of an appropriate level, and they're scattered around a
room or a camp. You'll want to fight the closest ones first, for reasons
that will be apparent in a minute. Announce to your party the order in
which you want to fight them. For example, say "Left front woman bandit,
then right front woman bandit." Your party targets the first one and waits
for you and the designated "puller" to call them in.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Make sure your party is ready, then Soothe the BACK monsters (furthest
from party) and make it quick. As soon as you've got 2 or 3 soothed, say
"GO" and have the designated person PULL the targeted baddie with a spell
or range weapon. When this works, i.e. when your Soothe takes, the front
baddies run to your party and the back ones sit there patiently until you're
ready for them.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A couple points here: If you soothe the front baddies and call the
back ones, the front ones wake up when the back ones run through them.
Also, make sure your party is far enough from the remaining mob that they
won't join in when they awake.</b><b></b>
<p><b>So now let's say you're fighting a group of six, with three soothed
and three on your party. Here's where the power of an enchanter really
comes in. Your well-trained party knows to use the /assist command to assist
your "designated hitter" (usually our biggest tank), so they're all attacking
ONE of the THREE baddies on your group. You, as the enchanter, now click
madly on the pile of baddies bashing your group to select one that's not
being hurt. Use Mesmerize to put that one to sleep. Your party is now taking
damage from only TWO of the three. Mez the other baddie not being hit.
Now your party can now easily finish off the ONE left fighting.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now you step back and keep an eye on things. If any new critters
join the fight, mez them quickly. You can cast Suffocating Sphere (choke)
on the one the party is killing, though this shouldn't be necessary and
it's best to save your mana for mez.</b><b></b>
<p><b>An interesting point: When a creature is soothed or mezzed, it can
be safely debuffed without waking it. So, if you've time and mana and a
big ol' mezzed monster, cast Tashan, Languid Pace, some form of Weaken,
or whatever else you've got handy on the critter. When it wakes, your party
will be amazed at how easy that big ol' monster was.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Next, the first baddie finally dies. The party looks around to see
the other ones mezzed and waiting patiently. The designated hitter starts
in on one and the party joins in. The third creature should wake up shortly,
so keep an eye on it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Important point: Make sure your party understands the need to attack
THE SAME TARGET. If everyone in your party is thumping on a different creature,
your powers of Mez are useless because a mezzed creature wakes up the instant
someone hits it or casts a damage spell on it. Also, make sure your spellcasters
know NOT to use area attack spells or group damage spells for the same
reason.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That's the basic strategy. It's beautiful when it works, but sometimes
things go terribly wrong. When that first or second soothe fails horribly,
you've suddenly got 5 or 6 monsters in your lap. We fragile enchanters
can't take much bashing. In this situation, your party needs to GET THEM
OFF YOU. They need to get in a couple hits on everything to distract them
from you. The healer, assuming you've got one, needs to keep you alive.
Once the critters are back on the rest of your party, back away from the
mob. At this time you'll have a couple bubbles of HP and be full of mana.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Now your party needs to concentrate their attack by assisting the
designated hitter. Then start mezzing like crazy and the baddies shouldn't
bother you any more. I find it also quite helpful to have my own "guardian
angel". This person watches over me. If a spell doesn't take and pulls
one of the critters to me, my angel whacks it a couple times to get its
attention, then returns to the designated hitter's target, knowing that
I will mez that naughty critter right quick.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When the battle is going and the corpses start dropping, loot the
first one as soon as it falls. When the second falls, leave it a bit before
looting. The tactic here is to spread the spawn. You want to loot them
far enough apart that you could kill one between loots. Now, instead of
having to perform the heroic battle vs. 6 creatures every time, you can
take them one at a time as they spawn.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The wonderful thing about this strategy is that if the party is fighting
only one creature at a time, you're dishing out a whole lot more damage,
more stuns and bashes, and the creature can barely manage to get any hits
in. Those previously nasty casters can hardly get a spell off. It's like
taking your group from one single baddie to another, but you don't have
to travel for it.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Regarding the education of your companions... some can learn, some
can't. Find people who understand and enjoy this strategy and group with
them. It's easier to convince new party members when the whole party agrees
that this is the ONLY way to go. It's amazing how this can spoil the people
you party with. They'll get used to taking big tough mobs with you, then
try the same mobs with a mass battle tactic and everyone will perish.</b><b></b>
<p><b>It's a work of art when everyone knows his or her part and it's done
right. Try it out and help spread the word. It's tough trying to educate
the masses when many of our own class don't know how powerful an enchanter
can be.</b><b></b>
<p><b>See you in Norrath,</b>
