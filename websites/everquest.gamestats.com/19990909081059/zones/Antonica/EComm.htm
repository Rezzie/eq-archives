<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">Next
to the newbie zone of Freeport.&nbsp; Also a pass through to the western
part of the continent including Qeynos.&nbsp; This zone connects to W Commonlands
to the west, Freeport to the east, North Ro to the south and Nektulos Forest
to the north.&nbsp; Hunting areas include a couple of orc camps and a cemetery
full of ghouls, zombies and skeletons.&nbsp; The orc camps are often heavily
camped, but if you are a high enough level, you can often hunt the ruins.&nbsp;
Monsters split mostly north and south of the main road.&nbsp; South of
the road, along the mountains are the undead such as zombies, skeletons
and lesser mummies, as well as the undead ruins.&nbsp; Beware of the occasional
air elemental, which can only be hit with magic.&nbsp; Also south are asps,
known for dropping giant snake fangs and pumas, which are good hunting
for lower levels.&nbsp; North of the road are various animals such as young
kodiaks, lions, giant spiders, giant scarabs and darkweed snakes (which
drop giant snake fangs, but can cause poison that will drop a person pretty
quickly).&nbsp; The two orc camps are located north of the road.</font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000">&nbsp;The biggest worry in this zone are the
several griffins which periodically run around and slaughter everyone in
sight.&nbsp; The griffins generally patrol the area along the road leading
from the first to second inn.&nbsp; There are four inns which are referred
to by the players as follows:&nbsp; 1) First Inn is the one closest to
Freeport, 2) Second Inn is the next in down the road from the first inn,
3)&nbsp; Third Inn is the one nearest the Western Commonland border, and
4) Fourth inn is the one along the mountain between the orc camps. The
first and second inns both have guards stationed nearby for protection,
but are sometimes visited by Griffins, especially the second inn.&nbsp;
Be very careful if you decide to meditate there.&nbsp; Your best bet is
to meditate next to the third inn, which rarely ever sees a griffin.&nbsp;
You can buy food at either the first or second inn, depending on which
innkeepers are selling at the time.&nbsp; If you can afford his prices,
there is a good weapons merchant in the tunnel to N Ro.</font></b>
