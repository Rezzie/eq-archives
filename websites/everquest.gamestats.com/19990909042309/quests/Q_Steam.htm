The Magician Guildmaster, Tergon Brenclog, in Ak'Anon will ask you to kill
Bugglegup, a troll who wanders the Steamfont Mountains.&nbsp; Bring back
his head for a reward.&nbsp; (Submitted by Doriath)</font></b>

Jarah Reskar in the Gem Choppers Hall will tell you that the Cargo Clockwork
goes from Ak Anon to the windmills every five days at 8 am.&nbsp; A group
of 3 highwaymen (it is rumored that one is Bugglegup) have been attacking
it.&nbsp; A reward is offered for the bandits' heads.&nbsp; Zondo Hyzill
in Steamfont is standing next to the Cargo Clockwork.&nbsp; (Submitted

At the observatory past the windmills in the Steamfonts a female gnome
name Brona Frugrin is a telescope lens crafter and she believes that if
you can get the retina of the beholder named Borxx, who may be found in
either Runnyeye or Beholder at certain times, and return it to her, she
can create a telescope unlike any other.&nbsp; Borxx is a L30&nbsp; Evil
Eye-type monster.&nbsp; Bringing back his loot, the evil eye lens, will
yield an awesome 2h blunt weapon called the <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics/Staff_of_the_Observers.html">Staff
of the Observers</a></font> that has Attack 12, Attack Delay 39,&nbsp;
+5 INT, +5 WIS, +30 Mana.&nbsp;&nbsp; It also casts the L8 Enchanter spell
"Sentinel"&nbsp; which will warn you of approaching hostiles which is very
useful while meditating. (Submitted by Tothis, Wicca and Aoiryuu)</b>
<p><a NAME="Telescope Lenses (A)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Telescope
Lenses:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Tobon Starpyre, the Wizard
Guildmaster, wants you to collect four spare telescope lenses from four
observatories around the Steamfonts. He gives you a rolled up note with
the names of the four Royal Observers, three of which are located in the
Steamfont Mountains while the last is located in Lesser Faydark.&nbsp;
These are supposedly the four lense locations&nbsp; 1) The gnome royal
observer just outside zone line in Lesser Faydark will give&nbsp; you one
if you ask.&nbsp; 2) The gnome royal observer in one of the observatories
in Steamfont will also give you one if you ask&nbsp; 3) The gnome royal
observer in another observatory tells you it was stolen by a Dark Elf female,
Zenita DRin.&nbsp; She is in Freeport in the secret tunnels beneath an
inn by the docks. You can get the lense two ways.&nbsp; Kill her - she
is approximatley level 15 and hard to kill.&nbsp; Or you can play cards
with her (if you have an OK faction with her) by continuously trading her
a bottle of something you can purchase upstairs for a draw of a card until
you manage to draw a King.&nbsp; (This one is confirmed)&nbsp; 4) The final
royal observer in Steamfont tells you his brother, Bidl Frugrin, went to
Kelethin to do some observations with the spare telescope lens.&nbsp; He
says he has likely found the local tavern and has gotten drunk, wandering
the
forest by day, and hanging out in the tavern by night.&nbsp; At night,
he can be found in the tavern next to Trueshot Bows in Kelethin and happily
gives you the telescope lens. Take the lenses to Tobon Starpyre and give
all four to him at once.&nbsp; He will give you a level 8 spell (Fire bolt
being one) and approx 1 pp.&nbsp; Faction changes include +Eldritch Collective,
-DarkReflection, -TheDead, +GemChoppers, +KingAkanon.&nbsp; (Submitted
