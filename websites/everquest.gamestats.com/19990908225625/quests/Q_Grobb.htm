The shadow knight guildmaster wants you to collect bone chips for him.&nbsp;
Get four chips,and return them for experience, faction and an item (usually
a rusty 2 handed sword).&nbsp; Your faction for SKN and DarkOnes goes up,
factions FrogloksOfGuk, BrokenSkullClan and DaBashers(?) go down</b>
<p><a NAME="Fire Beetle Eyes"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Fire Beetle
Eyes:</font>&nbsp; In Grobb, talk to Basher Nindan or something similar.
His name doesn't matter, he doesn't move around. Right before the tunnel
to Innothule Swamp is Basher Razbaz. Go past him, away from the tunnel
and Priest of Discord, and there is a small river. Swim along it, and on
the right will be a cage with a Froglok prisoner and a Basher or two. Follow
this area's tunnel to the back, where the correct Basher is. If hailed,
he tells you to bring him 3 Fire Beetle eyes, and he will give you "shinies".&nbsp;
You get a minor gem or jewel for returning the items, and occasionally
a minor magic item (such as a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Brass_Earring.htm">Brass
Earring</a></font>).&nbsp; You also get a positive faction hit with Da
Bashers and a negative faction hit with the Broken Skull Clan. (Submitted

give you a little experience &amp; a rusty 2h battleaxe.&nbsp; You also
get positive faction with Da Bashers and negative faction with the Broken
Skull Clan.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can do it as much as you want. He must be really
hungry.&nbsp; (Submitted by KingOgg)</b>

Dung Pie:</font>&nbsp; Hergror is hungry, and he wants a Fungus Dung Pie
(yech). He says to go to tell Carver Cagrek "Hergror wants his Fungus Dung
Pie".&nbsp; He is the troll on the dias in front of the Shaman's Guild
near the bank.&nbsp; When you talk to Cagrek, he complains that Hergror
is always hungry and that he needs 4 Fungus Spores to make a pie, but not
to hit them too hard or you ruin them.&nbsp; You can get the spores off
of the Fungus Ancient in Upper Guk and on a very rare occasion off an actual
fungus spore.&nbsp; If you complete this and give Hergror the pie, he will
award you with some patchwork, leather or raw-hide armor.&nbsp; (Submitted

This is the quest to get the <a href="../equipment/graphics/Grobb_Cleaver.htm">Grobb
Cleaver</a>.&nbsp; It starts in Grobb (of course).&nbsp; Talk to Carver,
by the Shaman's guild, and he will tell you he wants 3 pieces of a meat
called "HEHE meat" and the recipe to make it.&nbsp; You can purchase the
meat in Oggok from Dooga the Ogre Chef.&nbsp; (He has a seperate quest
to deliver froglock legs).&nbsp;&nbsp; He will send you to deliver a Grub
Locker of Dwarf Pickles to his Troll friend in the Ocean of Tears, Nerbilik.&nbsp;
Nerbilik is fishing on the Siren rocks.&nbsp; Be careful, since I have
been told the guards may kill you even though they con indifferent.&nbsp;
Give him the locker and you will receive approximately 1 plat, increased
faction with DaBashers and decreased faction with BrokenSkull Clan, and
some xp.&nbsp; However, he will refuse to give you the recipe he has, so
you need to kill him and loot it from his corpse.&nbsp; Then take the recipe
and 3 HEHE meats back to Carver and he will give you a Grobb Cleaver for
you efforts.&nbsp; (Submitted by Ashrum)</b>
<p><a NAME="Hulkulk's Love"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Hulkulk's Love:</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
Be forewarned that this quest will lower your faction with the dark bargainers.&nbsp;
In the Night Keep, talk to Hukulk.&nbsp; He mentions [Helm of Hukulk],
and upon asking him about the helm, he refers to a Lynuga who broke his
heart.&nbsp; Hukulk asks that you go to Neriak to see who Lynuga meets
with, possibly kill them, and return the head of her lover and the Bracers
of Love that he gave to her.&nbsp; In return, Hukulk will give you an extra
Helm of Hukulk.&nbsp; I am told you need to give him both the bracers and
the head (presumably of Lumpkin) to get the helm.&nbsp; Lynuga can be occasionally
found floating in the water near the entrance to Guk. She won't mention
anything about the [Happy Love Bracers] but if you&nbsp; ask her about
them, she will tell you she gave the ugly things to her boyfriend, Guard
Lumpkin, in Neriak and that the relationship was over.&nbsp; Lumpkin will
tell you that Ratraz now has the bracers.&nbsp; Ratraz is a bouncer in
the Maiden's Fury in Neriak.&nbsp; You have to kill Ratraz. If he runs
while your fighting him, and you're a troll or ogre, be aware that you
may have to duck while chasing him through some of the lower arches in
Neriak, so you will have to reclick your autoattack. I haven't had anyone
jump in on that battle yet and I've let him run pretty far before. From
him you will get the happy love bracers (AC 1 bracers, I'd use them just
for the name alone if they weren't so lousy), his head, and a warclub.
Watch out!&nbsp; You do NOT want to give his head to Hululk! Lumpkin was
the one who stole Lyguna from Hulkulk, not Ratraz! Either put his head
in a seperate container or destroy it.&nbsp; The warclub is a decent non-magic
blunt weapon that you can sell for quite a few plat. Ratraz is about 19th
level.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you need to get Lumpkin's head. This is more of
a trick. He is found in the Foreign Quarter of Neriak. He runs around a
couple of the back rooms.&nbsp; Attack him when he is as deep in these
rooms as he gets! He is also about 19th and tries to run when hurt enough.
If he gets far enough a high level shadow knight jumps in and you're basically
doomed.&nbsp; From him you get his head and a rusty halberd.&nbsp; Take
his head and the Happy Love Bracer's back to Hululk to get your prize,
the </font><a href="../equipment/graphics/Helm_of_Hukulk.htm">Helm of Hukulk</a><font color="#000000">
AC5 +3 strength +3 agility, wearable by evil races only helmet and some
money (even up to some plat!) , experience, and Faction.&nbsp; Note about
factions. You will take faction hits from Neriak Outer Guard for killing
both Lumpkin &amp; Ratraz. All I know is half the merchants in the foreign
quarter will no longer sell to me, it may be from doing this quest or it
may be from killing the visiting priestess in Nejena.&nbsp; Be warned.&nbsp;
Also if your standing is too low with shadowknights (or perhaps if you
are not a troll shadowknight), you will get nothing for turning in the
quest items to Hulkulk. (Submitted by Igjarjuk and ).</font></b>

corpse in the middle) will reward you with a nice pair of <a href="../equipment/graphics4/Grobb_Oven_Mittens.htm">Grobb

from the closet:</font><font color="#000000"> If you go into the Shaman's
Guild and talk to the Shaman upstairs near the throne (I forget his name),
he talks about the head Shaman, Kallie (?). He says she hates him because
he let some skeletons of hers out of the closet and now they're running
around Grobb causing trouble. (funny) Apparently there are 4 skeletons
running around the city of Grobb. You are supposed to find all of them
and ask them "Come Back to the Closet" and see what they say. They will
ask you for items to entice them to return to the closet.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Spore Guardian"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Spore Guardian:</font>&nbsp;
This quest is also given by Hulkulk's assistant in the Shadowknight Guild.&nbsp;
You have to get the head of the Spore Guardian.&nbsp; The Spore Guardian
spawns in the Innothule swamp, and it's corpse sometimes has a "Huge Mushroom
Head".&nbsp; Giving the mushroom head to the the correct troll in the SK
guild hall will get you a <font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics2/Froglock_Skin_Mask.htm">Froglok
