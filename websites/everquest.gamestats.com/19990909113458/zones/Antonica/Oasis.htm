<br><b><font color="#FF0000">Description:&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font color="#000000">A
lake area between the two Ro deserts and a very popular hunting zone.&nbsp;
This is one of the best zones in the game for players in their low to mid
teens.&nbsp; Most players tend to hunt crocodiles and caimens near the
shore, where there are pillars in the water that are safe for resting and
meditating.&nbsp; These are very good experience, but have virtually no
loot.&nbsp; This area also gets extremely crowded.&nbsp; There is an orc
camp in the SE corner and 2 derv camps in the SW corner.&nbsp; These camps
are good hunting, and often overlooked by players too busy hunting crocs.&nbsp;
Orcs wander the desert and can sometimes drop decent loot.&nbsp; There
is a major orc spawning point near the ruins not far from the gypsy camp
where a full group or two can easily pull and kill a steady stream of orcs.&nbsp;
Beware of going there without a lot of players though, because the orcs
tend to come in waves.&nbsp; Many people also hunt orcs by the zone to
North Ro, sending out a person with SOW to lure them and fight them next
to the zone where you can quickly run for safety when in trouble.&nbsp;
There is a tower underneath the lake, which used to have relatively low
level aqua goblins, but now has very high level deepwater goblins guarding
it.&nbsp; No word if there's anything good inside the tower.&nbsp; There
are a number of sand giants roaming the area that you need to keep a lookout
for, and a huge crocodile named lockjaw that will kill lower level players
(though he is hunted pretty quickly when he appears as his skin can be
used to make several nice items).&nbsp; There is also an island in the
middle of the&nbsp; lake with a tower guarded by several spectres.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, high level characters often go there to kill spectres, get
killed themselves, and loose a spectre or three over the zone which wanders
around indiscriminately killing everyone.</font></b>
