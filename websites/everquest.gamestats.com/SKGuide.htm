Freeport</font></font></b></center>

<p><b>So you want to try the dark side, eh? Well, following find a guide
to the first few levels of starting a human Shadowknight in Freeport.</b>
<p><b>Level 1: You start in West Freeport like everybody else but your
home is really in East Freeport in the slums. Before you start killing
things take the time to memorize the layout of Freeport. Take particular
care to develop a route from the West Freeport newbie zone to the East
Freeport slums that avoids passing any character with an honorific in front
of their name. If you see Sir or Lady above a characters head RUN! I was
randomly killed by several Paladins at levels 1 to 3 before I developed
that 6<sup>th</sup> sense that told me that someone had a lot of Orc in
them. Guards, on the other hand, are generally okay, they won’t be civil
to you but they won’t kill you either.</b>
<p><b>Well, you’ve looked and looked and you can’t find the SK guild. The
guild note says it’s in East Freeport in the slums in the basement of a
condemned building, but the only condemned building has a locked or jammed
door. I spent an hour searching for it with another newbie SK. Finally,
he gave up in disgust. I was sure that the guild was where it was advertised,
based primarily on consistent guild-type casting sounds, and continued
to search. I’m not going to spoil the search for you but I will tell you
that it IS in the condemned building and it IS in the basement and the
entrance is via a secret in another adjoining building. Have fun searching…
And if a SK newbie asks where it is don’t shout the location to him. Tell
him or better yet lead him to it. Followers of Innoruuk are not well liked
in Freeport and we need our refuges.</b>
<p><b>So, we’ve found the guild, gotten our tunic and we’re ready to bash!
Actually, not quite yet. Two things remain:</b>
<p><b>First, you need to map out the underground of Freeport so that you
can move around easily. It’s dark so I recommend killing a Firebeetle for
an eye, which appears to be better than a torch. Also you don’t have to
hold the Firebeetle eye in your hand, just having it out in one of your
open inventory slots activates it. The Underground includes exits in East
Newbie, West Newbie, The Docks, and the Harbor. There are also several
ways to get to North Freeport, which is important because the Paladins
that guard North Freeport will kill you on sight. I haven’t accurately
mapped these yet so there’s work to be done.</b>
<p><b>Secondly, speak to every NPC in the underground, several have quests
that will advance you and one in particular will help you to level much
faster. Hint: If you do her quests you won’t be selling most of your loot,
you’ll be turning it in for equivalent cash AND XP instead. I leveled to
4 and 6 while transacting with her. I think she gave me a 15-20% boost
on overall XP earned prior to level 6 and this made up for the SK penalty.</b>
<p><b>You’ve now spent an hour or two setting up your SK and grounding
him or her in Freeport. Time to hit the newbie zones. I recommend starting
in West Freeport because it will dramatically reduce your run time after
dying and you’ll probably die a fair amount. Watch out in particular for
the Orc Pawns, who like to ambush you while you’re fighting another creature.
Firebeetles also gang up on you but only if you’re fighting another Firebeetle
or an Orc Pawn.</b>
<p><b>Anything that CONs blue or white is a viable target but watch out
for the helpers. Stay in West Freeport until you’ve reached level 3. Kill
Fire Beetles as soon as you can because of the superior XP and other benefits
associated with them. Other prime targets are Decay Skeletons, because
of the Bone Chips and weapons that they carry. Finally, kill Orc Pawns,
kill many of them. They also give okay XP and carry weapons now and then,
but the primary benefit is with the commons folk who will treat you more
kindly as your faction goes up. This can really help with trading later
on.</b>
<p><b>Get a Rusty 1H slash weapon as soon as possible and also a 1H blunt.
If you get lucky and acquire a Cracked Staff keep it as your 1H blunt,
it’s the best 1H blunt for this level. However, don’t use only your primary
weapon to fight. Keep switching back and forth between 1H blunt and 1H
slash, you’re going to advance slower than normal because of being an SK
and you need to bring those skill levels up. It’s very frustrating to get
to level 6 and have to slowly bring up 1H slash because you became so enamored
of the Cracked Staff.</b>
<p><b>By the way, the reason that I’m advocating one-handed weapons is
that your Bash (level 6) is going to become an important element of your
game later on and as a human you have to have a shield equipped to bash.
Some players suggest that SK’s, who don’t get Dual-Wield later on, should
use 2H weapons to get maximum effect from their Double Attack skill. I
disagree. The Bash is so important against spell casters later on that
you can’t afford to give it up. You will sacrifice some damage at lower
levels but when you can afford well-balanced weapons later on this effect
is minimized.</b>
<p><b>At level 3 it’s time to visit the East Commonlands or Northern Ro.
Your targets this time are primarily Spiderlings for the XP and Spiderling
Silk, and Firebeetles who still provide good XP and of course those wonderful
Eyes. Decay Skels are now a secondary target but still useful for chips
and weapons. If you have a choice try not to spend too much time on the
Black Wolves and Armadillos, they give good XP but generally very poor
loot.</b>
<p><b>Begin to buy odd pieces of leather armor as the opportunity presents.
I skipped patchwork armor completely and I recommend this course as you
should be largely outfitted in leather by level 6.</b>
<p><b>One of the things that pulls at the young SK is the need to hit the
optimum (blue or better) targets at all times. Your advancement is significantly
slower because you’re a hybrid class. I found that green targets were just
not feasible unless the reward (staff, weapon) outweighed the time spent.
Decay Skels are an exception because they die in 2 or 3 swings and the
chips are worth a lot to a young SK but other than that I avoided greens
even if nothing else was in sight. I just kept hunting. The net effect
is that you’re not as rich as the average young character and this was
the thinking behind skipping patchwork which costs 2 plat to outfit completely.</b>
<p><b>Level 4 expands the target choice to Black Bears and Coyotes. I only
attacked these if they were white, for the XP. Loot is minimal from these
and I treated them like wolves and avoided if anything else blue or better
was available.</b>
<p><b>A note on Harm Touch: This does (your level x 10) +1 damage to white
conned and below targets. It recycles every 60-75 minutes (approx.) and
whenever you die. Before level 6 do NOT be afraid to die. I would typically
stand in against a white creature down to my last half bubble before using
Harm Touch. SK’s need to take risks to advance quickly and prior to level
6 there is virtually no XP loss when killed. This is another mechanism
for catching up to other character types in advancement. If you’re running
for the guard you’d better have a darn good reason (very long run to get
corpse, no idea where you are, etc.) I did find myself reflexively running
for the guard when double teamed until I realized the best solution was
to use Harm Touch to finish off the critter in front of me and then gracefully
accept the retrieval of my corpse. You die, HT comes back, along with full
HP and you’re ready to go. In addition to which you get the XP from your
dying kill. By level 5 there are situations in which dying just seems like
the natural course of events. This also makes for GREAT roleplaying of
an SK, you’re just practicing for the undead thing later on…</b>
<p><b>Level 5 is a tough level. Your best hunting ground is probably the
Northern Desert of Ro. Well, at least the first set of Dunes. The problem
is that there are several creatures wandering the desert who will kill
you fast. Watch out for madmen. They hit for 20+ and home in from an impressively
wide range. I finally learned to leave the dunes and rest by the guard
after my second unfortunate sitting encounter with a looney. Give mummies
a wide berth, if they hit you they can inflict rabies and there’s nothing
more miserable than a rabid SK.</b>
<p><b>Another sidenote: Go anonymous, do this at level 1 and keep it on.
Many players will heal or cure an anonymous player, virtually nobody likes
a Shadowknight. Decloak now and then so that a Troll or Dark Elf can WHO
you. Trolls are good buddies for hummie SK’s. Dark Elf Necros are also
natural allies. Treat Trolls and Dark Elves the way a good character would
treat good races. Roleplay the nasty but do nice things for your allies.
This will pay off big time later on when you begin to think about killing
Dwarven Guards and the like.</b>
<p><b>Enough of the bad stuff, this is what you CAN hunt in NRO at 5. Orc
Raiders, Jackals (in the dunes) and Spiderlings (in the green belt). Orcs
tend to pop in in groups of 2 or 3 and then patrol out on their own. When
you initially spot a cluster, follow one of them and ambush him when he
gets out of sight of the others. If you get jumped by a couple of Orcs
use Harm Touch to kill one and then get ready to retrieve corpse. It takes
just as long to heal to full as it does to retrieve corpse and you don’t
have HT available instantly if you survive. Prior to level 6 don’t try
to survive. Living is for suckers… This also applies to getting jumped
by a Puma while fighting another creature. Make sure you kill the one in
front of you and then go visit Innoruuk for a little while.</b>
<p><b>If the hunting is poor in NRO you have another option. You can go
back to East Commons and kill Bears and anything else that CONs white or
blue. Continue turning in quest items until level 6. Don’t get frustrated,
5 is just a bad level, 6 will be much better.</b>
<p><b>Once you finally reach level 6 your horizons broaden. You can now
hunt well into the dunes in NRO, virtually all the Orcs are killable, Pumas
are now a target for good XP. Things just look a lot better. And you have
another option: A human SK is able to hunt in Nektulos Forest. The guards
will glower at you but as long as you don’t hail them they won’t attack
you. I tend to hunt the white skels at the end of the left path over the
bridge, they give excellent XP.</b>
<p><b>If you followed the one piece of leather at a time strategy you should
now be at AC 130 or more and most white creatures will have some difficulty
hitting you. I am exclusively hunting white creatures and feel that my
level 6 advancement is similar to my experience with other non-hybrid characters.</b>
<p><b>Update: Well I reached 9 last night. Time played was almost exactly
36 hours, which is similar to time played at 9 for my Barbarian Warrior
and Wood Elf Druid. At this point I think the human bonus and hybrid penalty
are cancelling each other out.</b>
<p><b>Levels 6 through 8 were spent exclusively hunting in the northern
dunes of North Ro, with an occasional foray into the flats to the south.
The primary targets were Orc Raiders, often 2 or 3 at a time, Pumas and
blue Jackals. The creatures in NRO are relatively docile (except for Pumas,
Madmen and Mummies) or slow chasers. The Madmen and Mummies can both be
outrun to zone if you take care not to look back. Guards will kill Mummies
but Madmen frighten them so you NEED to zone. Yellow Pumas are the biggest
threat because you can’t outrun them or outfight them. Look to other players
for help or go visit Innoruuk, we’ve done that a few times… By level 7
no Pumas will be yellow.</b>
<p><b>I found that after level 6 I basically hit everything in sight that
was not Poisonous (more on this later) or Yellow/Red. The problem is that
the blue creatures (mostly Pumas and Jackals with the odd Orc Raider) carry
very little loot. This means that you need to hit the green Orc Raiders
whenever you see them. Khan has earned 30 pp as of the beginning of 9 and
probably half of it came as a result of weapons or armor taken off of Orcs.</b>
<p><b>Fighting as a Shadow Knight takes on new dimensions when you reach
level 6. The biggest change is that Bash is now available. Many guides
list it as level 12 but it actually shows up at level 6. I put 1 training
point into it and let it advance naturally and by the middle of 6 it was
close to max. The effect of Bash is to let you inflict additional damage
approximately every 2<sup>nd</sup> round. Initially I was bashing for 2
or 3 damage but as the skill level improved I began to see up to 8 damage.
Combined with Harm Touch you can now take on 2 blue creatures simultaneously
and handle selected white creatures with ease. My level 6 SK felt very
similar, if not superior, to my Warrior when he was 6.</b>
<p><b>At 6 and above you have the option of fighting blue/white poisoning
creatures, like Rattlesnakes and Desert Tarantulas. These are very good
for XP but I really recommend avoiding them unless you’re desperate. The
reason is that they cause a lot of downtime due to poison. Being at 3 bubbles
of health after killing a Puma or several Orcs is very different from being
poisoned at the same health level.</b>
<p><b>Notes on movement and sighting in the desert: Stick to the ridgelines.
Visibility is key and you don’t want to get caught in a wadi (desert gully)
when a big nasty comes over the ridge. In addition, use 3<sup>rd</sup>
person perspective when fighting and resting. I use the zoomed out mode
and virtually never get ambushed. Remember that Alt-Arrow key rotates the
view without moving your character. When I fight I always have a guardian
angel looking over my shoulder. I also try to drag my prey up onto a ridgeline
after snaring it. The payoffs are many; in addition to security you often
get the chance to scout your next victim while you’re still killing the
last and finally, 3<sup>rd</sup> person perspective is one of the coolest
things about this game. I’m really amazed at what Sony/Verant/989 has accomplished.
Make sure to watch at least one sunrise and sunset in this mode, they’re
much superior to the first person view.</b>
<p><b>I find myself spending less and less time in the underground at this
point. The quests that are related to Freeport require a higher level SK
so they’re back-burnered for the moment. There was one particularly cool
quest that I did at level 5 that required a jaunt to the West Commonlands.
Talk about adrenaline. There’s nothing in the WC that won’t smear a level
5!</b>
<p><b>As I sit at level 9 my only real concern is what to do with all the
silver and copper I’ve accumulated. The one service that I really don’t
have access to is a Bank. The Vault is in North Freeport and I’m KOS there.
I’m not sure that I’ll be able to physically carry enough money to the
Gypsies to buy a combine in a few levels. Right now spurs aren’t the only
things in the desert going jingle, jangle jingle.</b>
<p><b>A few corrections to points made earlier: I gave up the notion of
maintaining high skill levels in both 1h blunt and 1h slash. I found myself
taking too much damage from creatures early in the level, which would cause
downtime and also noticed that even with an INT of 85 I was rarely maxing
out my combat skills by the end of the level, probably an effect of being
a hybrid. I’m currently a 1h slash only SK and my skills (offense, 1h slash)
are always maxed at the end of the level. I’m beginning to think that the
hybrid classes level at the same rate as the other classes if you’re very
disciplined and restrict your play choices to narrow advancement paths.</b>
<p><b>I also under-reported the AC effect of Leather. I was actually at
160 at level 6 and am currently at 208 at the beginning of level 9. This
is a 10% or better improvement over Patchwork based on my experience with
other characters. White creatures hit me about 33% of the time and blue
creatures have trouble hitting me at all. It’s not unusual to fight 2 blue
Orcs simultaneously without losing a half bubble of health.</b>
<p><b>At level 7 I began to care if I died. On the bright side very few
things that I chose to attack from that point on had any real chance of
killing me. I did suffer 2 deaths at level 7. The first was completely
accidental; while running to East Freeport at 2 bubbles of health I bumped
into a madman returning to the desert. Well at least it was quick. The
second was my fault. I decided to kill a white rattlesnake with 4 bubbles
of health and HT available and was poisoned 6 times in the opening moments
of the battle. I used HT to kill with a bit more than 2 bubbles left and
then sat down and watched 70 hp go away to poison. Oh well, you die and
learn as they say…</b>
<p><b>Harm Touch updated: I have now used HT often enough to say with confidence
that it will not be resisted often by white and lower creatures. In fact
I’ve only had it fail to do maximum damage twice. Both times against white
creatures at level 7, once it did only 61 points instead of 71 and once
it did half damage.</b>
<p><b>When Harm Touch is available I’m substantially stronger than a fighter
of the same level. When it’s not I’m a little bit weaker. I now find myself
hanging onto HT longer because as long as I have it up I can solo white
creatures without fear. When I’ve used it it’s back to the blue things
for a while. The fighters will become better at melee than me when they
reach 15 and get Dual-Wield and Double-Attack and I hope to have a few
leveraging techniques to make up the difference by then. Hopefully the
pet will suffice.</b>
<p><b>Last, but not least, I think it’s a mistake to hunt in Nektulos Forest
at these levels. I haven’t died there yet but there are several factors
that add up to trouble. All of the guards glower at you with the exception
of the halfling deputy who glares threateningly. Also the night-time visibility
is really quite poor for a human even with a Firebeetle eye. I blundered
into a very red Kodiak in the darkness at one point and was saved only
by the timely intervention of a DE guard as I ran through the forest at
2 bubbles and declining. I am going to visit the foreign quarter in Neriak
but for now I have stopped hunting there.</b>
<center>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Part 2:&nbsp; Khan's Shadow Knight Battle Tactics</font></b></center>

<p><b>At level 9 and through level 15 a human shadow knight becomes quite
a fearsome solo player. The elements that come into play at 9 include a
pet, which at level 3-5 is quite sufficient to either help with damage
or lead the initial assault. Siphon Strength, which appears to significantly
weaken creatures, particularly when cast multiple times. And Disease Cloud,
which does 5 pts of damage per casting and prevents regeneration of hp
as well.</b>
<p><b>When you combine these new elements with the existing melee skills
of a SK (strong weapon damage and Bash) and, of course, Harm's Touch, you
have an extraordinary amount of damage potential in one package.</b>
<p><b>The tactics that I employ to achieve maximum effect are as follows:</b>
<p><b>After I've reached an area that I expect to find white or selected
yellow prey in I cast Leering Corpse. Frequently I fizzle a few times but
eventually my pet emerges from the Netherworld. Each fizzle requires a
small amount of downtime to recover mana but the material component (2
bone chips) is not removed unless the spell casts successfully.</b>
<p><b>At this point I have the pet engage a few lesser creatures (Decay
Skels, Firebeetles, Spiderlings, etc.) and carefully track the damage it's
doing. What I'm looking for is 12 pts of damage per round. This indicates
a level 5 pet that will be able to fight well against higher level foes.
I never intervene in the battle myself because I don’t care to save a weak
pet. SK pets are roughly half the level of the SK so there's no other way
to gauge their effectiveness, they all con green to you. While I'm evaluating
the pet I regain most of my mana and if the pet is suitable I'm ready to
hunt. If not, I reclaim it and summon another. Repeat until level 5 shows
up.</b>
<p><b>Once the hunt has begun I have 2 primary target types. The first
is any non-poisonous or disease causing white target. The second is yellow
targets that meet the above requirements and also do melee damage only.
I select targets carefully with two thoughts in mind: 1) I want to have
predictability in the combat sequence so I only engage casters under optimum
circumstances, and 2) I want to minimize downtime after combat so I avoid
the poisonous and disease causing mobs that create extended downtime.</b>
<p><b>After selecting my target I decide which of the SK battle plans will
be most effective.</b>
<p><b>The predominant plan involves an armed pet, preferably with a rusty
2h sword, scythe or halberd. The primary concept here is to use the pet
as an extra damage source throughout the combat. To this end I make sure
that I am always the target of the mob and I do whatever I can to save
the pet. Combat generally proceeds along the following lines:</b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>I draw the mob to me by casting Siphon Strength. I have auto-attack
on and frequently I get the first blow in as it charges.</b></li>

<li>
<b>The pet engages and I carefully maneuver so that I am on one side of
the mob and the pet is directly opposite me whacking away at it's backside.
This is a delicate procedure because 3 hits from the mob will destroy the
pet and given that this is the plan in use against yellow mobs I am in
trouble if the pet dies. Note that the mob is deep red to your pet if it's
yellow to you.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I taunt and, of course, bash at every opportunity. This is critical
because you have to build up damage and hatred early on. The pet is doing
a consistent 13-19 pts of damage with it's 2h weapon and the mob WILL turn
on it and destroy it if you don't keep the damage and taunts going. Remember
that the pet is striking from the rear and as a result it hits nearly as
often as you do. I use a Mino Axe as my primary weapon and even the relatively
short delay compared to the pet's 2h weapon barely equalizes the damage.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Eventually, the pet will draw the mobs attention. The damage that pet
does combined with the taunts that it produces every 3<sup>rd</sup> or
4<sup>th</sup> round are just too much to be ignored. As soon as I see
the mob turn I cast Disease Cloud and then Siphon Strength again. And then
I do everything I can to redraw it's attention. The best method is to quickly
run around in front of it and interpose your self between the mob and the
pet. You cannot get the mob off of your pet from the rear. This is the
most important moment of the battle because if you can't save the pet you
usually won't win.</b></li>

<li>
<b>If the pet has died, which happens occasionally, I use Harm Touch immediately
to assess whether I need to run or have a chance to win. If the pet lived,
I now gradually, very slowly, begin to shift away from the pet. I am trying
to turn the mob around by degrees until the pet has a rear attack angle
again. If in doubt that I can accomplish this without having the mob refocus
on the pet I just fight side by side with the pet until the battle is over.
The pet is not very effective from a front facing. If I think that I have
no chance to win I won't waste Harm Touch. I'll just run suddenly while
the
pet is still there to block for me. I get a 2 second head start as the
mob finishes the pet and this will usually get me to zone.</b></li>
</ol>
<b>This plan works perfectly against white mobs and very well against the
selected yellows also. It's an almost guaranteed win against Sand Scarabs
in North Ro and I leveled from 10-12 very quickly there killing the yellow
ones.</b>
<p><b>The second SK battle plan is used primarily against white and loot-rich
blue targets. This plan involves pet sacrifice and therefore I usually
don't arm the pet when I'm using it. The idea here is to use the pet to
minimize downtime afterwards without having it take an experience cut from
the battle. The sequence I use is:</b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>I order the pet to attack the mob.</b></li>

<li>
<b>After it has engaged I cast Siphon Strength and Disease Cloud.</b></li>

<li>
<b>I join the melee and begin to taunt and bash. Normally the pet will
be near his last legs at this point.</b></li>

<li>
<b>If the mob is still focussed on the pet I cast Siphon Strength again.
At this point the pet will die and I'm soloing the mob with the benefit
of several hits from the pet and the spells that I was able to get off.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Normally I kill the mob with 4 bubbles of health left. If things get
out of hand I will Harm Touch but usually I win handily and have a minimal
downtime afterwards.</b></li>
</ol>
<b>Both of these plans work well against appropriate targets. It's important
to note that the first plan should only be used, and yellow mobs should
only be attacked, when Harm Touch is available. You actually only need
to use HT about 10% of the time but it's hard to make accurate tactical
decisions in it's absence. Too often a mob will suddenly frenzy when it
gets to 25% health and start hitting you for insane amounts of damage.
Given that you need to run at about 2 bubbles if you're going to make it
you often have to leave a combat early for safety when HT is not available.</b>
<p><b>One question that remains unanswered is whether Siphon Strength cumulatively
subtracts from opponent, it's not cumulative on me in terms of adds. I've
noticed that there seems to be a big difference in damage that an opponent
can inflict after I've Siphoned several times as opposed to just once.</b>
<p><b>I have yet to run from or die to a white creature while soloing using
these tactics, and generally the down time afterwards is minimal. Which,
at levels 9-15, is a significant improvement over my Barbarian Warrior,
who usually won against white creatures but was substantially bloodied,
and my Wood Elf Druid, who was unable to reliably melee solo white creatures
on a consistent basis.</b>
<p><b>I'm going to briefly go over again the killing yellow targets sequence
so that I don't get anybody killed.</b>
<p><b>In order to kill a yellow melee opponent four things must be true:</b>
<ol>
<li>
<b>The target must be melee only. No casters, no poisoners and no outrageous
damage mobs. Sand Scarabs, Young Kodiaks, Orc Warriors, lone Dervishes,
Dreadbones and Greater Skels all qualify. Griffawns, named NPC's and Ghouls
don't. If in doubt don't attack.</b></li>

<li>
<b>The pet must do significant damage, if pet dies early you can’t win.
Pet needs to be attacking from the rear most of the time. This creates
better damage and less chance of pet death.</b></li>

<li>
<b>You must be able to cast Siphon Strength before you or the pet engages.
I've seen significant evidence that casting it several times has a cumulative
effect.</b></li>

<li>
<b>Harm Touch must be available for emergencies.</b></li>
</ol>
<b>If all of these are true you'll win 80% of these battles. If any are
not true you can't win. The one death that I experienced at level 9 was
due to a weak pet that collapsed after 2 hits and a series of stuns that
occurred thereafter. If I'm really confident near the end of the battle
I'll take off auto-attack and back away and let the creature kill the pet.
I've noticed a minor improvement in XP when the pet doesn't survive the
battle.</b>
<p><b>Obviously this tactic gets slightly less effective at each subsequent
level until 15 due to the pet becoming less effective. At about level 13
I had to begin to really carefully parse opponents because the pet was
10 levels below the target and might be unable to do damage depending on
target type. Note that when you reach the level you get an interesting
effect: The pet now does less damage against yellows but is also 10 or
more levels below them meaning he takes NO experience from the pool.</b>

<p><b>I think I've solved the Human SK No Bank problem. I'm throwing money
away instead of banking it. Seriously, I decided to try Smithing with Khan
and he's now a very poor boy. 70 plat, or 7000 silver to be more accurate,
has turned into 54 smith levels (trained to 21 and then raised to 75 while
using the skill.) With most characters I would not recommend Smithing,
as the eventual reward does not add up to money and time spent in my opinion.
For a human SK however Smithing may be a good way to turn unmanageable
sums of loose change into skill levels that will add up to real money later.
<font color="#FF0000">HUGE
Update</font>: Guards in Neriak in Commons are now Apprehensive although
the Guards outside are still Glowering. This means that Khan has access
to the Bank in Neriak and to the vendor who sells Ore. I don't know if
hidden factions caused the change or if it was in a patch but Human SK's
just became better than Dark elves in my estimation. I also don't know
if an early level Human SK would have the same faction. Khan was not accepted
in Neriak Commons at level 9.</b>
<p><b>An offshoot of the Smithing is that I've found a reliable route to
Groflah's Forge in North Freeport. It involves using the sewer system to
move from West Freeport to North Freeport and then a short run to the forge.
Take great care to avoid the NPC in front of the Bard's Guild, he doesn’t
like SK's very much.</b>
<p><b>The bank in North Freeport is still off limits because of the Paladins
who guard it.</b>
<p><b>The West Freeport sewers are extraordinary. The sewer system appears
to be completely separate from the E Freeport/W Freeport tunnel network
and there are several huge chambers available (much larger than anything
in the tunnels.) I would make one of these the site of any large gathering
of Dismal Rage type PC's. One thing that I'm still looking for is an exit
from the original tunnels to West Freeport that's inside the city. The
only exit I've found so far is to the newbie grounds.</b>
<p><b>Neriak also has a brilliant hidden tunnel system. There is a direct
connection from the SK Guild in the Foreign Quarter to the Toad Stool in
Commons. This network probably has hidden branches that I haven't discovered
yet.</b>
<p><b>At 15 I still believe that the human SK is not only a good class
to play early on but might well be one of the best. I highly recommend
this race/class combo. The only thing I would change if I had it to do
over would be my sex. Female characters seem to get a lot more help from
other players.</b>
<p><b>I'm now splitting time between 3 characters so Khan's progress has
slowed some. I'll definitely publish another look at human SK's when I
hit 22 but that might be awhile</b><font size=-1>.</font>
