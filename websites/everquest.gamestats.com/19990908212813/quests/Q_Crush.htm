<p><a NAME="D'Vinn's Heart (C)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">D'Vinn's Heart:</font>&nbsp;
This quest is given after you complete the Orc Runner Quest.&nbsp; The
Paladin Lord in the basement of the Paladin's guild in Felwithe wants you
to kill the Dark Elven Ambassador D'vinn and bring back his black heart.&nbsp;
D'vinn is in Crushbone but you had better be armed to the teeth with a
solid group before trying to tackle him.&nbsp;&nbsp; For all your work
you get a few pieces of gold and some minor experience.&nbsp; One of the
more worthless quests in the game.&nbsp; (Submitted by Tshober)</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Belts (Kal)"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc
Belts:</font>&nbsp; Turn in orc belts to Canloe Nusbeck in the warrior's
guild for experience,&nbsp; faction and minor money and items.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can turn in as many as four at at a time.&nbsp; The general consensus
is that four items will just be treated like giving one item four times,
so it is just a time saving device.&nbsp; You can find these by killing
orcs in Crushbone. Faction changes are as follows:&nbsp; + Stormguard,
+ Merchants of Kaladim, + Miners Guild 249, +Kazon Stormhammer, - Cracknek
Warriors.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Submitted by Bigo)</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Legionairre Shoulder Pads (Kal)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc
Legionnaire Shoulder Pads:</font>&nbsp; Turn these in to Canloe Nusbeck
in Kaladim.&nbsp; As with the orc belts, you can find these by killing
orcs in Crushbone.&nbsp; You can turn in as many as four at at a time.&nbsp;
I have been told that you have a chance at a better item with two at a
time, but that more than two will not help.&nbsp; I am not sure if that
is true or not.&nbsp; One will get you an item as well.&nbsp; As of now,
you can turn these in even if your faction is too low for him to actually
give you the quest. You will get some decent weapons (sometimes even bronze
ones worth several pp each) and items for these.&nbsp; Faction changes
are as follows:&nbsp; + Stormguard, + Merchants of Kaladim, + Miners Guild
249, +Kazon Stormhammer, - Cracknek Warriors.&nbsp; (Submitted by Bigo).</b>
<p><a NAME="Screaming Mace"></a><b><font color="#FF0000"><a href="../equipment/graphics3/Screaming_Mace.html">Screaming
Mace:</a></font>&nbsp; You need to get a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic (found
on Crush) and a Bracer of Battle (found on the Orc Warlord) to complete
this quest.&nbsp; You are also supposed to have a Shiny Brass Shield (found
on the Orc Trainer), but you should be able to do it without one. Then,
go to the Slaver hut with the Dwarven Smith and the Elven Priest.&nbsp;
First talk to the Dwarf smith, who talks about armor and asks for the Shiny
Shield.&nbsp; If you have the shield you can give it to him and he will
ask for the tunic.&nbsp; Give it to him, and you will receive a dwarven
mace.&nbsp; Alternatively, if you don't have the shield or don't want to
give it up (Why would you), you need to say to the smith "the king is dead"
and then ask him "what about ringmail".&nbsp; He will then ask for the
tunic and give you the mace.&nbsp; Once you have the dwarven mace, talk
to the Elven priest and say "the King is dead".&nbsp; He&nbsp; will then
ask for the Bracer.&nbsp; If you give it to him, he gives you a Prayer
Cloth of Tunare.&nbsp; Then give both the mace and the prayer cloth to
the Priest, and he gives you back a Screaming Mace, an 8/36 magical weapon
that occasionally yaulps.&nbsp; (Submitted by Fflewddur)</b>
<p><a NAME="Slave Keys"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Slave Keys:</font>&nbsp;
You need to give a slave a copper and he'll tell you what key will free
him, and you can use keys on slaves for faction.&nbsp; When you kill an
Orc Slaver, sometimes they will give keys. The keys always are the same
for the particular race/sex combo of a slave, but different slaves can
spawn in the same places. Each key has a number to go to a lock on the
slaves.&nbsp; When you match the key with the lock (slave) you will get
xp and some cash.&nbsp; The number/lock combinations and faction changes
I have been given are as follows: (1) Gnome Mage: Key No. 15. Dark Reflection
gets worse;&nbsp; Eldritch Collective,&nbsp; Gemchoppers, King Ak'anon
get better, The Dead gets worse (2)&nbsp; Dwarf:&nbsp; Male Key 16.&nbsp;
Stormguard gets better, Miners guild 249 gets better, KazonStormhammer
gets better,&nbsp; ClericsofUnderfoot gets better.&nbsp; - Female Key 17.&nbsp;
KazonStormhammer, MerchantsofKaladim, Stormguard, MinersGuild249 better
and Craknek Warriors worse; (3)&nbsp; Wood Elf: Male Key 18 - Female Key
19&nbsp; KelethinMerchants gets better, Emerald Warriors gets better, Merchants
of Felwithe gets better; Cushbone orcs gets worse (4) High Elf:&nbsp; Male
Key 20 - Female Key 21 KeepersoftheArt, King Tearisthex, Faydark's Champions
get better, The Dead gets worse; There are also keys 22, 23 and 24, but
I'm not sure who they go to.</b>
<p><a NAME="The Taskmaster's Earring:"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Unfinished
Molds:</font>&nbsp; Several Slaves give you unfinished molds in exchange
for other items.&nbsp; How they keep these items as slaves is a mystery.&nbsp;
The three items that get molds are a Taskmaster Earring, Brass Earring
and the Shiny Brass Shield.&nbsp; I am not sure what you do with the molds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
