<p><a NAME="Bandit Sisters (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bandit Sisters:</font>&nbsp;
This starts in Felwithe with the High Elf Paladin Guildmaster.&nbsp; He
will ask you&nbsp; if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"&nbsp;
Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you
are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).&nbsp; If you
say you are inexperienced,&nbsp; he tells you about a fallen member of
his order in Kelethin.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you say you are experienced, he
gives you the jojongua's pelt quest).&nbsp;&nbsp; You then need to talk
to the drunk named Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale.&nbsp;
His sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser Faydark who have
joined the dervish cutthrouat and are giving his family a bad name.&nbsp;
Being a good father and paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters,
retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all at once.&nbsp;
Beware.&nbsp; These bandits are pretty tough and will not willingly part
with their jewelry (approximately level 10 to 13).&nbsp; You will get experience,
faction and an item when you return all four necklaces.&nbsp; (Submitted

<p><a NAME="Bladed Weapons"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bladed Weapons:</font>&nbsp;
The Druid guildmaster, "Heartwood Master," wishes to rid the world of bladed
weapons, because they're forbidden by Tunare.&nbsp; Bring him a Rusty Short
Sword, a Rusty Long Sword, a Rusty Broad Sword, and a Rusty Bastard Sword,
and he'll reward you with faction, around 6 gp, XP, and a random weapon.</b>
<p><a NAME="Emerald Warriors Tarnished Sword"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Emerald

reward you with xp, faction, money, and an item (often tattered armor).&nbsp;
Your faction improves with the Merchants of Kelethin, Emerald Warriors
and Merchants of Felwithe and goes down with Indigo Brotherhood.&nbsp;

the plans and three enchanted gold bars, he will make a weapon.&nbsp; The
plans come from a sand giant in So Ro.&nbsp; He's not named but he is in
the twenties instead of the thirties like most sand giants. Get an enchanter
to enchant three gold bars and give Bilrio the bars - don't stack them
- and the plans, and in return you receive the <a href="../equipment/graphics5/Brazen_Brass_Kilij.htm">Brazen

Dill Fireshine, in the ranger's guild hall, has a odd need for orc hatchets.&nbsp;
You can feed his need by killing orc hatchetmen (occasional hatchet wielding
Orc Pawns and Orc Centurions) in Greater Faydark and Lesser Faydark and
returning the hatchets to him two at a time for money, experience and faction
and an occasional item (usually a tarnished 1HS weapon).&nbsp; The faction
changes are as follows:&nbsp; Faction with Faydarks Champions, King Tearisthex,
Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of Tunare gets better, and Crushbone Orcs
gets worse. (submitted by Panoyen)</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Runner"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc Runner:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This quest is given by Dill Fireshine after you do the orc hatchet quest.&nbsp;

runner.&nbsp; The orc runner can be found in butcherblock.&nbsp; He runs
around a lot, but the easiest place to find him is by the two cabins hunting
area. The faction changes are as follows:&nbsp; Faction with Faydarks Champions,
King Tearisthex, Clerics of Tunare and Soldiers of Tunare gets better,
and Crushbone Orcs gets worse. You sometimes get a pretty nice reward for
this (sometimes worth several platinum), and a decent experience boost.</b>

is bad, Xentil herkanon has betrayed the Scouts and Kelethin, you must

ask him about the "scouts silvermesh&nbsp; leggings" and he will begin
with a long story mentioning many names.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember all those
names and keep asking the prompted questions.&nbsp; You will&nbsp; finally
be directed to kill Faldos Hendrys to obtain the Gem of Tunare.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To&nbsp; find him, you must talk to several people.&nbsp; However, I knew
he hung out in&nbsp; North Qeynos so I didn't go talk to anyone.&nbsp;
Find Faldos Hendrys either in Crows Tavern in North Qeynos or walking around
outside the gate.&nbsp; Kill him&nbsp; (He conned blue to me at level 21)
or pickpocket him to obtain the Gem of&nbsp; Tunare.&nbsp; The gem is actually
an Emerald Shard and is LORE, NO DROP, so if&nbsp; you have friends helping,
make sure you loot him.&nbsp; Return the Gem to the guildmaster in Kelethin
for your <font color="#000000">Silvermesh Leggings</font> (AC 7,&nbsp;

Long Bow:</a></font>&nbsp; (click to see stats) This now actually results
in a trueshot longbow.&nbsp; Start the quest by talking to Maesyn Trueshot
in the ranger's guild.&nbsp; You need four&nbsp; items to complete the
quest.&nbsp; (1) Spiderling silk.&nbsp; (2) A Micro Servo, which can be
gotten off a rogue Clockwork in Steamfont (they are rare drops), and with
the recent patch perhaps off runaway clockworks too.&nbsp; These are no
drop items, so be ready to haul these around for a while until you complete
the quest. (3) Some Dwarven wire, which has a side quest.&nbsp; You must
give the man in Kaladim some tumpy tonics.&nbsp; You get these by retrieving
a kiola nut and a flask of water for Trumpy Irontoe in Kaladim (so that
he can make the tonics). The kiola nut is on an island in the Ocean of
Tears, and a flask of water...well you can get that anywhere. Give these
to Tumpy Irontoe (also in Kaladim) he makes the tonics, you give those
to the dwarf Tratnor Everhot, who walks around the everhot forge and&nbsp;
the mines, and he gives you the dwarven wire.&nbsp; (4) Lastly, you need
treant wood. You must travel to Freeport and give Jyle Windshots (note
the Jyle you want is in West Freeport - be wary of imposters) a small lantern
or, possibly if you are a Ranger, your guild tunic and he will give you
some treant wood.&nbsp; Combine these and give them to the Maesyn.&nbsp;
He will give you&nbsp; a Treantwood Bowstave.&nbsp; If you ask him, he
will reveal how you can use this to assemble a trueshot longbow.&nbsp;
In addition to the Bowstave, you need a Plane, a Microservo and some Dwarven
Wire.&nbsp; You can use these ingredients to assemble a trueshot longbow
if you have the bowyer skill.&nbsp; (Submitted by Banar, Lt. of Clan Ironfist)</b>
