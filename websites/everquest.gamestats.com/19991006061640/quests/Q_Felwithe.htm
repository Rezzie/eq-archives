<p><a NAME="Bandit Sisters (F)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bandit Sisters:</font>&nbsp;
This starts in Felwithe with the High Elf Paladin Guildmaster.&nbsp; He
will ask you&nbsp; if you are "ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare"&nbsp;
Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics of Tunare" and he will ask if you
are new to this or experienced (something to that degree).&nbsp; If you
say you are inexperienced,&nbsp; he tells you about a fallen member of
his order in Kelethin.&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you say you are experienced, he
gives you the jojongua's pelt quest).&nbsp;&nbsp; You then need to talk
to the drunk named Tandan Nybright in Kelethin and listen to his tale.&nbsp;
His sad story centers around his four daughters in Lesser Faydark who have
joined the dervish cutthrouat and are giving his family a bad name.&nbsp;
Being a good father and paladin, he asks you to murder each of his daughters,
retrieve their pearl necklaces and return them to him all at once.&nbsp;
Beware.&nbsp; These bandits are pretty tough and will not willingly part
with their jewelry (approximately level 10 to 13).&nbsp; You will get experience,
faction and an item when you return all four necklaces.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Awen, Talison &amp; Zanshin)</b>
<p><a NAME="Bat Wings (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bat Wings:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Magician's guildmaster, Niola Impholder, is researching a spell and
needs some bat wings, 4 actually.&nbsp; Get them for her and you will recieve
faction, experience and a spell scroll.&nbsp; (Submitted by Aqulistor)</b>
<p><a NAME="Black Wolf Skin"></a><img SRC="iconupdated.gif" height=12 width=60><b><font color="#FF0000">Black
Wolf Skin:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wizard guildmaster Tarker Blazetoss needs
a black wolf skin for a spell.&nbsp; Return one to him and gain faction,
experience and a minor item, sometimes a spell.&nbsp; Faction will change
as follows:&nbsp; increase for Keepers of the Art, King Thearisthex, Faydarks
Champions, and decrease for The Dead.&nbsp; (Submitted by Soren)</b>
<p><a NAME="Bone Chips (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Bone Chips</font>:&nbsp;
The cleric guildmaster, Yeolarn Bronzeleaf, will reward you for killing
skeletons and returning with bonechips. Return to him four bonechips (stacked
will work) for faction, money and an item, normally a first level cleric
spell.&nbsp; (Submitted by Turlo Lomon)</b>
<p><a NAME="D'Vinn's Heart (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">D'Vinn's
Heart:</font>&nbsp; This quest is given after you complete the Orc Runner
Quest.&nbsp; The Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin's
guild wants you to kill the Dark Elven Ambassador D'vinn and bring back
his black heart.&nbsp; D'vinn is in Crushbone but you had better be armed
to the teeth with a solid group before trying to tackle him.&nbsp; For
all your work you get a few pieces of gold and some minor experience.&nbsp;
One of the more worthless quests in the game.&nbsp; (Submitted by Tshober)</b>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Going Postal:</font>&nbsp; This is a massive
quest involving most of the cities in Norrath.&nbsp; See the full quest
description in <a href="Q_Akanon.htm#Going Postal">AK'Anon</a>.</b>
<p><a NAME="Illegible Scroll"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Illegible Scroll:</font>
Lord Jyleel will ask you to bring him an illegible scroll,&nbsp; which
can be found, among other places, on the Crushbone Orc Oracles.&nbsp; (Submitted
by Doriath)</b>
<p><a NAME="Jojongua's Pelt"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Jojongua's Pelt:</font>&nbsp;
The Felwithe Paladin guildmaster will ask you if you are "ready to serve
the Clerics of Tunare" if you hail him. Say "I am ready to serve the Clerics
of Tunare" and he will ask if you are new to this or experienced (something
to that degree).&nbsp; If you say you are inexperienced, you get the Tandan
Nybright quest.&nbsp; However, if you say you have been with them for awhile
(or whatever&nbsp; [xxxx] line equates to that) he will give you a quest
to go to Innothule Swamp and slay Jojoojojgogogoguna, the long-named huge
Kobold lord in the aptly named Jojongua's Tower. Take his pelt to the guildmaster.&nbsp;
Nobody&nbsp; has told me how this ends up.</b>
<p><a NAME="Orc Runner (Fe)"></a><b><font color="#FF0000">Orc Runner:</font>&nbsp;
Talk to the Paladin Lord, Lord Jyleel, in the basement of the Paladin guild
in Felwithe.&nbsp; Occasionally an Orc Runner can be seen running from
the entrance to Greater Faydark along the path towards the crossroads.&nbsp;
He is relatively tough (be at least level 8 if you want to solo him), but
usually will yield a sealed letter upon his death.&nbsp; Take the letter
to the Paladin Lord.&nbsp; Give it to him to receive a faction bonus and
the quest for Dvinn's heart.&nbsp; (Submitted by Tshober)</b>
