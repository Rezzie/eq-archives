<br><b>EVERQUEST GROUP STRATEGY GUIDE</b>
<p><b>By Shane Hedegard</b></center>

<p>Not long ago, I ran across an article in the November 1983 issue of
The Dragon, entitled "Be aware and take care, Basic principles of successful
adventuring," by Lew Pulsipher. I had photocopied the article for a group
of friends who had just started playing Dungeons and Dragons. As a new
group of adventures, they often fell victim to many newbie pitfalls "Look
a dragon, CHARGE", not knowing when to quit, utilizing common sense, and
basically lacking the basic survival skills Adventures need in any fantasy
game. The article helped them, and I am hoping that it's application to
single players and <i>groups</i> of players on Everquest will enhance their
experience playing the game.
<p>However, I first must illustrate the obvious difference between face-to-face
(FtoF) fantasy game playing and playing Everquest online. The most obvious
difference between the two is proximity, in FtoF play everyone is right
there on hand, but in online gaming people are separated by hundreds and
perhaps thousands of miles. The effect this has on communication is obvious,
while FtoF players can view there characters in relation to one another
easily, EQ players will often find that they have a very limited view of
the battle. Characters in FtoF are almost never blindsided, but online
players can often be surprised by something that is outside of their experience
or field of view. In FtoF play, complex ideas and situations can be much
more easily expressed with pictures, three dimensional models, hand gestures,
body language, and verbal communication. However, in online play players
can only communicate through type written dialogue, which can be tedious
and lengthy. There are two simple solutions to this problem, both of which
are discussed below.
<p>First, a party should have a form of typing shorthand that everyone
can understand. Having a core of readily understood abbreviations is essential
for a group, like using "NP" for No Problem, "R" or "r" for ready to proceed,
"med" for meditating, "OOM" for out of mana, "LOM" for low on mana, and
"60" for up to 60% mana. During down time this might not be a problem,
as players have time to discuss things, but in the heat of combat, being
able to communicate in short easily understood phrases or single words
is essential. Groups should also engage their GROUP speak, which is easier
for players to see, as it is bright blue.
<p>Second, and perhaps more important, a party should have a group leader,
particularly if the group is large. It is the responsibility of the group
leader, often called the <i>caller</i>, to direct the group as a whole.
Such leaders make party decisions, where they are going to camp, where
to adventure, what particular monsters to hunt, delegate responsibilities
to party members, and generally ensure group safety. Leaders are there
to keep good situations good, and to keep bad situations from getting worse.
Leaders should also lead in combat, and direct the group as a single unit.
It is there for the responsibility of a leader to see when combat isn't
going well and direct the party accordingly. Perhaps with a hotkey that
says PARTY RUN when the Hill Giant appears, and a PARTY RETREAT hotkey
when a combat turns questionable. The group leader is responsible for forming
a well-rounded group, and responsible for declining Kill Stealers and members
that would take away from the group as a whole. Monitoring group health
and asking about mana, as well as controlling players, who burn mana or
become excessively injured, thus decreasing group down time are areas for
group leaders to be involved in. A leader should also delegate authority,
which character will initiate the attack, which character will bring the
mob to waiting party members, etc. In effect, the group leader is the person
who turns a poor group into an adequate one, the adequate group into a
good one, and a good group into an excellent group. Finally, they are there
to help in corpse recovery, and direct the party accordingly. Players benefit
from bowing to a more sensible and a more experienced voice, within the
group. Players who cannot, or will not cooperate, can always plague another
group, hopefully not yours.
<p>While the responsibilities of group leaders are great, good group leaders
will also benefit. Group leaders will often keep party members alive, and
those players will keep the group leader alive. Group leaders should also
enjoy choice loot and equipment, or a extra share of loot for their efforts.
When distributing loot, group leaders might often get first pick of equipment.
A better technique for division of loot, is hoarding equipment until everyone
is full, and then giving it all to one player to sell with a high CHA,
who then splits loot between the group.
<p>The following is an example that I will use throughout the following
article. In the example, we will see repeatedly that a Group Leader would
have made an important difference, in the unfolding events, and resulting
combat.
<p>While traveling through West Karana as an 11<sup>th</sup> level enchanter
Evar, a 13<sup>th</sup> level wizard (whom I will name Blasto) recruited
me into his group. He was accompanied by a 15<sup>th</sup> level warrior
(whom I will name Naked), and we quickly camped a three-bandit spawn point.
Taking them 1 or 2 at a time, we clearly outclassed them. They were all
blue to us. A Group Leader should have recognized this, and kept the party
size to two. Naked would charge into combat before spell casters were ready,
and Blasto would burn mana until empty on essentially dead targets. A group
leader would have corrected these two bad habits, decreasing the parties
down time. A gnome wizard stumbled across our path, and was instantly invited
into the group, when we already could easily dominate our camped spawn
point. A fight then proceeded over the loot order, which a good party leader
should have instantly have rectified. Then a 15-minute debate occurred,
the topic being whether to move to another bandit spawn point, with more
bandits. A vote was taken and we moved to the larger spawn point. Once
there another 15-minute debate occurred, centered on how we should attack
the 4 bandits camped. When a plan was agreed upon, more bandits had spawned.
This raised a third debate about whether to attack or not to attack. A
10<sup>th</sup> level paladin appeared, and he was promptly invited to
join. While the paladin healed from 2 bubbles of health, the debate raged.
Finally a consensus was reached. The wizard then used a viewing spell to
spy on the bandit camp, which promptly trained 4 bandits down on him. He
was killed in 10 to 15 seconds; the paladin attempted to intervene, and
when the wizard was slain, all bandits turned their attention to the paladin.
I engaged in HtoH with a bandit, managing to draw two off the paladin.
The warrior engaged close to the paladin, but failed to take a target off
him. While engaging in hand-to-hand, with spells timed between bandit attacks,
I watched helplessly as the magician stood off in the distance, failed
to engage in HtoH, cast a single spell, and neglected to send his pet into
the melee. Suddenly, three more bandits trained in. Now the party us 6
(4 characters and two pets, minus the slain wizard) vs. 7 bandits, three
near death. They concentrated on the paladin and me we were both killed.
The 15<sup>th</sup> level warrior turned and ran, and the magician gated
out. I was bonded to a distant zone. Before I get back the group broke
up, with several people going offline, leaving me to search for my corpse
on my own. A party leader would have cut short an hour long waste of time,
kept party focus on the simple task at hand, and not made an evenings play
a nightmare. Nevertheless, this is all water under the bridge.
<p><i>Elementary precautions</i>. This is simple, make sure that you have
what you need before your group sets out to camp, or hunt creatures. Make
sure that party members all have sufficient food and drink. This could
also include weapons and equipment. The last thing you want is a character
that has to return to town early, because he didn't bring enough food,
forgot a weapon, or didn't have enough carrying capacity. This is also
the time to give fierce consideration to what types of characters you want
in your group, be they spell casters, tanks, or hybrids. Striking a balance
between melee, spell casting, and secondary abilities is important. Thought
also must be given to what particular spell casters bring to the group,
be they healing, buffing, direct damage spells, or pets. Having a well
rounded party, that isn't tank or spell caster heavy, leads to a group
more able to deal with a variety of situations. While highly specialized
groups do exist, like groups of necromancers lifetapping targets to death,
or a group of druids using kiting tactics, parties generally want as varied
a group mix as possible. Typically, this would include, in a group of six,
two tanks, three direct damage spell casters, and a buffer.
<p><i>Whom do you trust?</i> "Lets hope you can trust your fellow adventurers,"
is a quotation that I will now always remember. In the above Group Leader
example, it became painfully apparent that I couldn't trust any of the
members of my party. I was the only party member of a group of loners,
the single individual that was interested in the group as a whole. When
the situation deteriorated, players began to abandon the group, leaving
three characters dead. Later, this was compounded when not even one of
them would help me recover my corpse. Clearly, none of my party members
cared about my safety or convenience, and I suffered for it. Mr. Pulsipher
stated "No one in his or her right mind will agree to adventure with someone,
whom he knows nothing about," but in EQ, it happens all the time. It happens
because of necessity; players generally don't know other people on their
server, so finding reliable partners and group players becomes a hit or
miss affair. However, with time, players will develop contacts and friendships
with those people that he knows he can trust. Poor players, kill stealers,
and other sorts of undesirables will quickly be shunned, for the company
of individuals whom you know you can trust. As your friends list increases,
others will gravitate toward you as well, if you are the type of player
they are looking for. For the ultimate in trust, look for guilds that match
your belief system, and interests. Finding a guild of hard core players,
all pulling to advance the group makes for excellent groupings. Reputation
also becomes important here, players who help others will attract birds
of a feather. You are looking for these types of players.
<p><i>Know your objective and stick to it</i>. Groups that form and keep
this premise will usually do better then groups that cannot. What's better,
these types of groups are fairly common (Looking for group to go camp Orc
spawn point, or hunt bears in Qeynos Hills). These groups are formed easily,
and are usually short term. Their dedication to achieve a simple goal often
makes these groups immune to the lethargy that afflicts other groups. It
is just as easy to see the effects of groups that form without purpose
(I don't know what to do. What do you want to do? Let's take a vote. I
don't want to do that. Let's go here. No, lets go there.). Such groups
stumble from one encounter to another, until they wander into a situation
they cannot control, or break up in disgust. In war, this concept is called
maintenance of the objective, which most simply put is to create a plan,
and then attempt to follow it through. Wars are lost by failing to adhere
to this simple principle, having an objective. Groups that fail to do the
same, have an objective will likewise suffer. Typically, groups form for
one of three things experience, loot, or money. Groups that are able to
follow this concept, maintenance of the objective, will gain more experience,
loot, and better equipment, then a group that stumbles from encounter to
encounter. If you objective is to simply have fun, more power to you. Realistically,
players that form good plans, and then stick them out, will walk away with
more experience, equipment, and money, then a haphazard group of individuals.
Forming groups, with concrete laid out plans will be of benefit to EQ players,
for all of the above reasons.
<p><i>Gather information</i>. This function should be performed both in
the game and out. With such sites as EQVault and EQlizer, and the links
they contain, there is no excuse for players not knowing about quests,
zones, spells, and a myriad of other subjects related to EQ. I've often
been surprised to find people wandering through zones like the Rathe Mountains
and the Qeynos Aqueducts completely lost, when maps exist online that are
both professionally done and easy to find. I've often found high level
characters, who have explored the above mentioned areas, who are surprised
to find that there are half a dozen magic items to be found in the Qeynos
aqueducts. These objects are easily obtainable by characters less then
fourth level, if only they took the time to gather information, on finding
such items. While discovery has its place on EQ, having good reliable information
is essential for Everquest. There is no substitute for having good information.
<p><i>Keep a monster chronicle</i>. For EQ players it's simple, know your
monsters. Know what monsters cast spells, which cause harmful effects like
disease or poison. This will allow you to plan accordingly. If you know
those Putrid Skeletons will, or might, cause you to catch a disease, cast
Endure Disease first; or a Protection from Cold, if you're going to adventure
in Everfrost and Permafrost. If that Gnoll shaman's spells are going to
be a problem, then use quicker piercing weapons instead of the two handed
ones to interrupt his spell while in melee. Getting to know your monsters,
before they kill you, is good.
<p><i>Provide for rescue/escape</i>. An escape plan need be nothing more
then, "Run for the zone," yet this somehow escapes many players. As you
read earlier in the Group Leader example, the magician's "escape" was to
gate back to Freeport, while we were in Western Karana. This effectively
removed him and his pet, from the group, where he could have just as easily
ran east to the nearby zone. However, lacking a clear-cut plan, the party
dissolved after its first tragedy. Providing a group a means to escape,
when they enter a scrape that they cannot win, or worse a situation they
cannot escape, is the duty of a Group Leader. Recovering your corpse also
falls in this area. Players are much more likely to venture into dangerous
places with a group, places they would never go alone. When they are inadvertently
killed there, what are the chances to recover your equipment without a
group, or even with one. With luck, another player may have a powerful
fall back character, or even better, a party that is as concerned with
recovering your corpse as much as you are. The good party will always have
an escape, and at worst, at least have a rescue.
<p><i>Equipment</i>. Be well equipped for your mission. While less important
in online gaming, then FtoF gaming, having the right equipment for the
job is essential. Usually it means making sure the spell casters have all
the necessary spells, and tanks have the best weapons available. Chances
are the spell the party doesn't have, is exactly the spell that they are
going to need later, so be prepared. Personally, as a young Necromancer,
the two most useful spells I had were cold light (a light spell) and locate
corpse (which I found I would use often). In both of these cases, these
spells were necessary equipment. Another example of this should be Bind
spells for higher level groups. Some jobs require the right tools, and
can not be completed without them.
<p><i>Security in camp</i>. Groups should do everything they can to insure
their safety during down time. This might mean avoiding camping where people
will train creatures to you, but more often then not involves taking sensible
precautions while spell casters meditate. I once played a low-level thief
(9<sup>th</sup>), who was always welcome in certain high level groups (two
or three times my level), because I was willing to take a watch while their
spell casters rested. Being on watch was effectively my job, and for that,
function these groups would allow me to pickpocket their kills, and often
provided me with VERY choice weapons for a 9<sup>th</sup> level thief.
While infrequently involved in combat, almost a liability, for these two
or three groups, I was invaluable. For the pittance they paid in equipment,
stuff they probably wouldn't want to carry anyway, they gained a level
of security in camp that they had never before experienced. However, most
groups will not have a "go for" to fulfill this roll. In a group of spell
casters, all whom are meditating between battles, the Sentry spell is invaluable.
However, far better, simply have your members who only need to rest, not
meditate, simply sit facing one another. One looks north, the other south,
as a means of watching the approaches to the party. Knowing that Hill Giant
is bearing down on the party in time to react can be more important, then
being 100% ready for battle. Non-meditating characters should take every
opportunity to survey their camp area for dangers. Tank characters should
realize that this is part of their group contribution, as they can view
the area while resting, while mana users must meditate if you are going
to call upon them.
<p><i>Avoid mental passivity in battle</i>. While making poor choices in
combat can make the tactical situation worse; taking any action is better
then doing nothing. Once a battle commences, players often forget that
there are other things that they can do to more positively influence a
battle, then hack away or cast direct damage spells. It will be of little
consolation to the dead tank, when the clerics avenge his death, when they
could have healed their compatriot or at least attempted to pull the creature
off him. The same would apply to spell casters who never entered HtoH combat.
I have often found that other mages have a disdain for HtoH combat, and
I often wonder why. Once these types of spell casters have exhausted their
mana, they will passively sit out the rest of the combat, instead of taking
an active part in its resolution. In the above Group Leader example, the
Gnome magician, his pet elemental, and the magician all avoided HtoH combat,
but their HtoH contribution to combat could have easily turned the battle
in our group's favor. Instead of adding to the battle's conclusion, the
magician delayed entering combat at all, until it became to late, and then
he gated out. This action reduced the group to a party of five (with my
pet), instead of a party of seven. If instead, the wizard had picked off
one of the bandits number as it approached, and attacked it with his pet.
Other players might have been able to withstand the initial assault of
the bandits, and we might have turned the tide against them. Instead, he
did nothing, with catastrophic results for everyone else but himself. As
an enchanter, I could not command my pet to attack, but prompted its involvement
in combat by going HtoH. This action enhanced the party's chances of survival,
regardless of the outcome. Doing something, anything is better then doing
nothing at all.
<p><i>Coordinate efforts</i>. "It should go without saying that the key
to survival in most adventures is cooperation among the characters, with
the group utilizing each character's skill to best advantage. In an AD&amp;D
(Everquest in this case) Adventure, for example, the party has the advantage
of "combined arms" cooperation between offensive spell casters (magic users),
defensive spell casters who double as infantry (clerics), and physical
combat power (fighters), and stealth (thieves)." The previously mentioned
group example clearly shows a lack of coordinated efforts. We were a group
only in name, not in spirit or practice, but rather a group of individualists
all motivated by our own particular needs. No party members cared if the
others lived or died, and it was this attitude that kept our group from
being able to effectively deal with these types of problems. We failed
to use any combined arms tactics, instead we all fought (or didn't fight),
as we all best saw fit. Then the fiasco that had begun ended.
<p><i>Keep reserves in reserve</i>. It may seem unusual, but a party may
often fight better, if one of their numbers forms a "reserve," and does
not actively involve him in battle. At first this may seem foolish, common
sense dictates that players use all their assets to quickly resolve a battle,
but a "reserve" can endeavor to do exactly that. If say the reserve were
the wizard who found himself killed in battle (again in our group leader
example), if he had held back, he might have observed the paladin about
to die. His intervention with a DD spell against a bandit might have killed
one of those three. This might have given the paladin time to lay hands
on himself, giving the magician the incentive to join the battle, perhaps
by directing the pet. This in turn might have allowed our "reserve" to
intervene on my behalf. However, having committed 100% of our party to
battle, we had no reserve to call upon. In warfare, the side with a large
strategic reserve historically wins, by intervening at the crucial moment.
This reserve could also be the Group Leader, who's job it might be to direct
the flow of a particular battle, and when necessary physical intervention
to save a hurt or endangered character.
<p><i>Don't take separate routes</i>. At first glance, this isn't what
it might appear. Here I refer to the group as a whole. A party should be
greater then the sum of its parts, and a divided party of smaller groups,
will fare worse then a combined party of six. The last thing you want is
to be jumped by a Griffon while returning to sell treasure, without your
party for support no less. The rule is simple, where one person goes everyone
goes. Characters shouldn't be more concerned with their individual loot,
but with the loot as a whole. While in FtoF games, a group of friends can
return to their game later, this often isn't the case online. The best
case scenario, is one in which the entire party is full to capacity, when
they all go into town to sell and divide loot, all at the same time. Using
alpha loot creates problems, especially with characters of differing strengths
and loot carrying capacities. Single party members, who gate to town to
sell, are vulnerable on the return trip. Far better, for the group to max
out their carrying capacity and then as a group go into town. Collective
distribution of loot and money, after the adventure is over, will more
often then not be much more equitable for players, but only if you can
find a trustworthy party. Once I found a group that used this system, and
understood it, I preferred it to all others, both for collective security
while traveling, and the amount of treasure I walk away with at the end
of an EQ session.
<p><i>Concentration of attacks</i>. This is perhaps the most overlooked
mistake EQ players make. Often a large party will battle another large
group of creatures, and most players in this situation will simply pick
a target and melee or cast spells, often picking the closest NPC possible.
All the above does is create lengthy battles, as these types of skirmishes
divide the damage inflicted over a great number of opponents instead of
just a few. If instead, this large party concentrated on one or two targets,
instead of the mob as a whole, they would have killed their initial targets
much quicker. This in turn would have reduced their damage taken. While
this method may waste mana, as multiple spell casters send simultaneous
spells against the same already dead target, you assure your party an eliminated
opponent as early as possible. This overkill type of tactic, melded with
a bit of caution, can make the difference between facing one or two less
opponents when they finally come in melee range. While concentration of
attacks won't be a problem against single targets, greater care must be
taken when attacking a group. If, in the Group Leader example, we had concentrated
our attacks on the weapon-wielding opponent while the bandits were unaware
of our presence, we could have outright killed the most dangerous member
of the bandit camp. In addition, we could have gotten off a second round
of spells, before they fell on us as a group. If we faced only five bandits,
we would have easily carried the day. Instead, the bandit NPC's concentrated
on the wizard, fighting him until he was eliminated. They then applied
this methodical method to their next closest target, the paladin. The effect
of this by the numbers attack was obvious then, as it is now. The computer's
conservation of effort against a single target insured its victory, as
much from their strength and our group's weakness.
<p><i>You can't beat everything</i>. It is important that groups realize
this, and plan accordingly. There is always going to be something out there
in EQ that outclasses your party, without trouble. When your party finds
this someone and you realize your licked, cut your losses and run. However,
this decision need to be a group decision or a decision made by the Group
Leader. The worst thing that can happen is that half of your party stays
to fight a battle they can no longer win, and the other half of the party
scatter and run away. In the Group Leader example, this is exactly what
happened. Once any single player decided that victory was impossible and
removed himself from combat, victory indeed became impossibility. I could
be accused of being the person who didn't cut and run, but neither did
the paladin. With hindsight, I might have been better prepared to make
good my own escape, but thought once one of us had committed to battle,
we all were. Clearly, I was sadly mistaken. This rule would also apply
to groups who are badly beaten, low on mana, HP or both. Creatures you
would normally deal with in your sleep can pose serious threats to a battered
party. Often, healers will heal up fighters to full HP, at great cost to
their total mana. Then, the fighters go off ready to go pick a fight, while
spell casters are still desperately trying to top off their mana. Healers
topping off the HP of tanks in small doses, one bubble at a time, instead
of piecemeal healing can fix this. This will give spell casters time to
get their mana up, and let the tanks recover as well, keeping everyone
at an equal point.
<p><i>Get out while you have some "bottom."</i> Uninjured characters must
deal with the temptation of just one more creature, while other party members
are low on HP, mana or both. It is this temptation for one more battle,
one more fight, one more cleaned out dungeon room, or one more wandering
encounter that has been the death of the entire party. Players need to
realize when enough is enough, and run for a secure place to rest. The
same applies to spell casters and their mana, its important not to place
your party in a dangerous situation because you have exhausted your mana
supply prematurely, or started without topping your mana up fully. Entering
battle with less then 100%, mana is foolish, for not only yourself, but
also your party members. A character engaging in battle with 80% mana may
find that the last bubble of mana would have made the difference in casing
just on more heal spell, teleport, or gate to safety. Likewise, players
need to conserve their characters as a group. No one party member should
be unduly injured, because one player then delays the entire group while
he rests through 4 bars of HP. Better to have the entire party only lightly
damaged in HP and mana, say a single bar each, then to be continuously
waiting for the wizard to finish meditating. Especially because he burns
unnecessarily large amounts of mana "overkilling" creatures, when he could
have cast one or two spells and joined the fighters in HtoH, resulting
in a more equitable distribution of damage to HP and mana usage.
<p><i>Never flee into unknown areas.</i> Retreating in the wrong direction
can be worse then not retreating at all. Characters that cannot find their
corpses because they became hopelessly lost, or were killed at a creature
spawn point can become unrecoverable. It is far better to die where you
stand, and do a /loc, then to die somewhere where you cannot recover your
equipment. When entering the unexplored area of a new zone, always retreat
the way you came, the way you are familiar. It is pointless to run from
a Hill Giant, only to get yourselves killed by a group of Orcs, just because
you didn't know their camp was there. Far better to adventure with a zone
to your back, for easy escape from NPCs. Then to make a catastrophic error
in judgement and find that you've just made your groups situation worse,
by becoming separated or abandoning characters joined in combat they will
certainly loose.
<p><i>Don't back yourself into a corner</i>. Mr. Pulsipher describes this
best, so I will use his full paragraph, directly. "In virtually every case,
it is better to have too many options then too few. This is related to
on one hand to the military principle of alternate lines of approach and
action, of contingency plans. On the other hand, it is related to the fundamental
idea behind good play in any game. That the player should control the course
of the game not let the game control his courses of action, you can hope
to control your fate. When you are reduced to only one choice, your are
probably in big trouble." This harps back to the earlier discussion on
having an escape. Groups however, will often see things in more black and
white. Attacking the same old creature in the same old way, when another
better method exists, that they are simply too lazy or uncreative to implement.
<p><i>Guard you spell casters.</i> You would think that everyone would
understand this, but for some reason, some groups don't. The result is
spell casters who cannot cast spells, because they cannot get out of HtoH,
are already dead, or worse charmed. Keeping spell casters out of the front
ranks is important, and it is the Group Leaders job, as well as the tank's
job to make sure this happens. At first, this may appear too refute my
earlier stance on spell casters (particularly wizards and magicians) not
involving themselves in HtoH combat, but in reality it does not. That tanks
should guard the more fragile spell casters is a given, but spell casters
not using their characters to their full potential (melee ability in this
case) is unforgivable. Repeatedly, my necromancer or enchanter has been
involved in HtoH voluntarily, while no other necromancer, enchanter, wizard,
or magician exposed themselves to HtoH for a single round of combat. Groups
that don't encourage their spell casters to develop their HtoH abilities
damage themselves, because someday spell casters will be required to draw
on those skills, like it or not.
<p><i>Make lists</i>. Players that make notes and lists will spend less
game time floundering for things to do and will not be as stumped on quests.
Simply put, those players who spend time thinking and write down things
regarding the game ahead of time will have fewer problems with their online
play. My friend keeps his notes, lists, command functions list, maps, spell
lists, race reference list, class lists, and reference to skills like jewelry
craft, in a black binder. They are all neatly, though that is a relative
word with him, accessible and easily on hand. My own tastes have driven
me to complete my own cache of researched information, in two folios, with
a nice outline and reference section. Either method enhances game play
by reducing the delay in trying to find certain locations, or knowing where
to go to sell when he's in a new zone. This type of information will also
be important later, when your friends character or your next character
want to complete such-and-such of a quest, but have forgotten an important
detail or event. We have gone so far as to create an outline for our characters
development, which when used sped our characters up too the levels, where
we wanted to play them at.
<p><i>Other precautions</i>. There are an endless number of things players
can do to improve their chances of survival, and enjoyment of the game
EQ. This includes many "tricks-of-the-trade" and good habits players have
gotten into, that drastically enhance play. These tips, spoilers, and for
some people exploits, are an essential part of the game. Picking up tactics,
in chat rooms, and message boards will broaden this "other precautions,"
category. In many ways, this section is tailored to individual players,
and their unique playing styles. If your paladin can't wait to get ghoul
bane, then get information on where to find it, and how it is obtained.
The same can be said, about any other class/race combination.
<p><i>Plan ahead</i>. As I've already stated, I like to plan, as is evidenced
by my having meticulously plotted out my characters development, level
by level. Ten or so levels before my character reaches a certain level,
I've already mapped out where I would like my character to adventure. What
creatures I'm going to combat. What equipment I'd like to obtain, and where
to go to get it. Typically, this leads my character, and those I game with
on the path of least resistance up the level ladder. My character typically
advances twice as fast, if I had planned nothing at all, has equipment
several levels higher then he normally would have, and has already developed
complex tactics with which to obtain my goals. The spells I plan to acquire
are listed in the order and expected level that I plan to purchase them.
I avoid worthless spells or spells that I will not use.
<p><i>Make friends.</i> This will come naturally on EQ, just give it time.
Players cannot help, if they continue playing, in attracting people who
enjoy interacting with you. While all groups will not be keepers, eventually
every player will find a group that match their maturity level, and perhaps
more importantly match the sophistication level of their battle tactics.
Players who find keeper groups should latch on to them if possible. Be
courteous and alert, because rude players are readily apparent by their
behavior, and good groups will avoid players like this, be on your best
behavior. You never know when those high quality groups may be evaluating
your character. All it takes is a single kill steal, or being rude to someone,
to have your reputation ruined. Players should be warned, that your reputation
could and will proceed you, so be careful when it comes to other people's
impression of you. Don't involve yourself in behavior that might get you
banned, or make people shun your company.
<p><i>Be courteous</i>. Don't use foul language, and if possible role-play
your character. Saying, "A pox on your house," or "Thy smell makes me retch,"
are just as easy to say then vulgarities like "up yours" or "f___ you."
Other players will enjoy quipy sayings like "Rogues do it in the dark,
and Dwarves do it underground," then the all too common vulgarities of
our every day world. As far as other people who do it, start building up
your IGNORE list. There are going to be plenty of 12 year olds out there
who for the first time in their lives, can swear to their hearts content,
with relative immunity to sanctions. While I don't mind children's playing
EQ that doesn't mean I have to put up with their poor language or behavior.
I've chatted with players with HUGE ignore lists, and they have always
told me the same thing, building an IGNORE list was the single best thing
they have done to enhance their game. Out of sight behavior, is out of
mind behavior.
<p><i>Practice, practice, practice</i>. The premise here is simple, practice
all the skills your character has regularly, even if you don't regularly
use them. Piercing as a skill might be shelved for twenty levels, as a
spell caster switches to a powerful two handed bashing weapon. However,
when the Skull Fanged Stiletto becomes available to the spell caster, suddenly
he never hits with it. The same could be said of warriors, who suddenly
switch types to a weapon skill that has been avoided, and they cannot effectively
hit their targets. Advancing spell skill, even in areas players don't normally
use, like Divination for the Necromancers, can later be important, as a
new circle of spells my require new magic types that have not been practiced.
Like wise, playing a wood elf ranger whom doesn't use foraging, hide, or
tracking might as well be playing a human warrior. If you're going to play
a race with skills, develop them, regardless of their personal use, because
your circumstances may change, and a skill may suddenly become very valuable.
Don't ignore languages. It may seem like a useless skill, but for spell
casters, languages eventually are required for spell research. The language
you speak, may be required for a different type of spell caster research,
or visa versa. So, keep current on your languages. One final note, practice
your skills, when your underwater or in combat against a fairly harmless
creature. These are both high stress environments, and skills will improve
faster in these environments. If you're 5<sup>th</sup> level, attack a
moss snake and then practice your spells on yourself or your directional
sense. Watch your proficiency levels, fly up.
<p>My conclusion is a simple one, enhance your game play by making good
personal choices in what your character does and with whom you associate.
Of all that I've discussed, these points are the most noteworthy, so I
will reiterate them here.
<p>(1) Appoint a group leader, when in a group, even if he is you.
<p>(2) Know the people you group with, if you don't know them group with
caution.
<p>(3) Know your objective, and then stick to it, don't get distracted.
<p>(4) Avoid mental pacivity in battle, make every swing and spells count.
<p>(5) Concentrate your attacks on a single, or a few creatures, instead
of a mass of them.
<p>(6) Plan ahead and make lists, they enhance game play.
<p>(7) Practice all your skills.
<p>Doing the above will help to make your EQ experience the best it can
possibly be.
