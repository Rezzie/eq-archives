<b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, I would like to suggest that if
you are not an enchanter, DO NOT pursue this craft for the following reasons:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Jewel craft is THE MOST EXPENSIVE skill
in the game.&nbsp; (I know, I have already invested over 1000pp into the
skill)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The spells to enchant the different
metals are extremely expensive ( 80 mana to enchant 1 silver bar, which
is the cheapest bar)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose to explore this trade, here is
the best way I know how to go about it:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; First of all, put 20 practice points
into the skill.&nbsp; This will get your skill high enough that some of
the gems are already trivial with a silver bar.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Buy a Jeweler's Kit.&nbsp; These are
found in most of the cities of the world, including Erudin, Qeynos, Freeport,
Kaladim, Felwithe, and Ak'anon.&nbsp; They look like ordinary small or
large bags, sold by the people who sell either the gems or bars for jewelry
making.&nbsp; You can also buy a Legacy of Jewelcraft from these same people,
but I never did and I don't think it has hurt me at all.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Now it is time to start.&nbsp; I suggest
saving at least 30pp before beginning.&nbsp; This is enough to buy 20 bars
of silver with enough left over to buy the gems.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; Buy as many
bars of silver as you can with 10pp left over for gems.&nbsp; Bars of silver
usually run about 5-6gp each.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp; Buy the lowest
gem on the list that is NOT trivial.&nbsp; When just starting, buy a malachite
which is the lowest and use them until they are trivial.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp; Place a silver
bar and the gem in the Jeweler's Kit and hit "combine".&nbsp; Keep using
the same gem until it becomes trivial.&nbsp; If done this way you will
minimize the number of failures while still going up in skill.&nbsp; You
can sell the jewelry you make back to the vendors for a small loss, until
you get to the more expensive gems ( the first like this for me was Emerald)&nbsp;
where you start making a small profit.&nbsp; Each gem should get you about
2-3 points of skill till it is trivial and you need to move on to the next
one.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>*** Note I do NOT suggest you use Enchanted Silver Bars when just
trying to raise your skill. If you are an Enchanter it wastes too much
mana and if you are not it costs too much money, and furthermore you do
not get a better price from the vendors.***</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp; The first 5
or 6 gems in the list are not really all that useful to enchant and sell
to pc's, as they only raise a resistance by 2.&nbsp; Once you can make
Cat's Eye Agate Necklaces (Cat's Eye Agate and silver) around a skill of
30 or so, it becomes useful.&nbsp; When the silver bar is enchanted in
this combination, it produces a +3 cha necklace.&nbsp; These can easily
be sold to pc's for about 2pp to 3pp, which is a 200-300% profit.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp; Once you have
gotten your skill up to silver and jade being trivial, I suggest moving
on to electrum... here's why:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1.&nbsp; Pearls cost 4.5 pp , making the total cost of a pearl ring 5pp.&nbsp;
If you fail that is 5pp down the drain, whereas 1 electrum bar and 1 malachite
failure is about 2.5pp, so you can fail twice as often and still not lose
as much money.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.&nbsp; An enchanted pearl ring is 2ac and +4sv vs. poison... not very
useful unless you are going out to hunt spiders.&nbsp; The next I think
4 gems are all similar until you get to opal, which costs a whopping 18pp
a hit.&nbsp; That is quite a loss to take if you fail.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Each bar will
get you approx. 50 points of skill.&nbsp; I am to the point that Jade and
Electrum (which makes the coveted Jaded Electrum Bracelet +10 mana +10
HP and 2 ac) is trivial, and my skill is 108.&nbsp; Once I get to the point
where the gem + electrum bar would cost more than Malachite + gold bar,
I will switch over to gold.&nbsp; I have invested roughly 1000pp into my
skill, not including the money I have gotten by selling jewelry back to
the vendors, so as you can see this is an expensive hobby.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Good Luck!!&nbsp; If you have any questions,
I am usually on Erollissi Marr every day.&nbsp; Times vary as my working
hours change from week to week.&nbsp; Give me a tell and I will do my best
to answer your questions.</b>
