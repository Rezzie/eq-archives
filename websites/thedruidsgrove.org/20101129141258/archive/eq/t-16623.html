I think this is a cool idea.</div></div><hr />

Never know when some freak accident might happen, like an asteroid hitting the world, global nuclear war, or even smaller scale disasters like that tsunami that hit Asia a few years ago. Or even a few seeds to keep a certain vegetation from dying out or becoming extinct. It wouldn't be a bad idea for alot of goverments to do something like this to help cope with crisis both in their country as well as out. Like say Canada gets snowed under for a few years rendering agriculture utterly useless for a period.</div></div><hr />

Seems low, almost ocean level.  I thought that one of the Doomsday predictions was that the sea levels would rise.  Hope the doors are water tight.</div></div><hr />

I was curious about how they built it with the Ice walls, It seems that the same effect relatively would take place with concrete about a foot thick, and still get the radiation effect from the ice. Unless there was something missed there, it seems it is possible for a collapse, or open to future works as well.</div></div><hr />
