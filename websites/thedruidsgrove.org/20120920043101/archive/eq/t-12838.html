<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">12-09-2005, 12:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a repost of my post in the Unkempt Druids forum because it isn't just a complaint, I also want to know what experience other people are having with this spell and perhaps learn what, if anything, I am doing wrong.<br />
<br />
Ever since I've gotten this spell, I've tried to figure out how to fit it into my root line up.<br />
<br />
Right now, it's in the &quot;never mem&quot; department.<br />
<br />
Allakhazam's says it's supposed to last 1 minute. I've found it never seems to last longer than 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just me but I really want a root that will land on mobs and stay on them long enough to help in a &quot;Sh*t hitting the Fan&quot; moment. This spell doesn't do that.<br />
<br />
When three or four mobs are attacking the group, rooting one with this spell and then throwing a heal and maybe rooting the next mob before having to even think about the first mob I rooted is the goal. A goal I have never managed to accomplish with this spell.<br />
<br />
What am I doing wrong here? Do I just have bad luck with the RNG? Is it lasting for a minute but it just seems to me to be six seconds because I'm busy?<br />
<br />
I don't know. Other people seem to think this spell is fine. For me, it is worthless.<br />
<br />
Any comments / help?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can realisitically keep 2 mobs locked with it, tho I tend to only do one.  <br />
<br />
As an example, if two mobs are next to each other, Sporespiral one of them, and the other will charge the group.  Since the root is seldom resisted, you can normally pull this off without dying.<br />
<br />
I have also used it to solo a few named which are high MR but not immune to runspeed changes.<br />
<br />
Yes, I do have to cast it more often, but it allows me to solo things without kitting.<br />

While doing the Unrest mission for augment, I tried to get the last named out of basement and that didn't go too well. So next try I memmed Spore Spiral and rooted him in his room. There's also some other zombie there, had regular root for that one. Then dot first named, then other one. That room is so small that you're still in melee range using regular root, but Spore Spiral helps giving you some space. Thankfully I got the aug on 2nd try :)<br />
 <br />
In raids we've sometimes used all the pushback rooting to place some hard-hitting adds in places we like.. that's fun :)<br />
 <br />
In groups with low crowd control abilities it's useful too. Two incoming - root one (it won't be resisted), then snare it and regular root it.<br />
 <br />
After all that, I still very rarely mem this spell.</div></div><hr />

Often I use it as a pulling tool.  Having an (almost) guaranteed root for a little over a minute is a great way to spread out pulls sometimes.  It also makes predebuffing easier, for times when I know a fight is going to be difficult.</div></div><hr />
