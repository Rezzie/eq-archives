I'd like that theft of thought proccing mace that is a chest loot on hard, and I know it is doable, but DAMN, the rarity of the mission start step is getting me down.  <br />

You get the mission from Tisthal in corathus, and go to the normal hive.  If Geeble Tripcrank isn't up, you kill skinwalkers in the top of the first tower to pop him, talk to him, then kill more skinwalkers until you miraculously get a cursor pop book and mission step completion.  This opens the actual instanced mission zone, you just need to go in and clear all 32 mobs in that zone, and you win.<br />
<br />
In 25 hours of soloing the skinwalkers in regular hive, ONCE I've gotten the mission step, and did go in and complete it, but got some crappy aug or something I think.   Been a while since I did it, since it was getting discouraging not even being able to proceed.  <br />
<br />
I do generally kill the skinwalkers in the 2nd tower, since it's more out of the way, and my pulls often look like trains, heh.  Does the first tower give better results maybe?  Or it just a normal bite me game setting.</div></div><hr />

Snare / egress split works</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the drop rate in normal hive, it still seems way too low.  In my experience, it's a 1 in 100 chance.  And since there are only a couple dozen skinwalkers in the zone, even a full, uber, group who could just march into the towers and slay all comers would end up waiting an hour for the mission update, just due to the chance of needing multiple full repops of the rooms to get the mission step.</div></div><hr />
