You werent specific enough, did you mean changes to everything or just druids?<br />
Also, I looked a bit closer at the druid changes, for a main tank, its not that bad, you still get about the same agro gains because of the way blizzard have downed damage but increased threat</div></div><hr />

<br />
why not look to other classes to see if they need any tweaking rather than nerf us so soon after abit of love <br />
<br />
we finally become fun and wanted for more than just healing and with a few short weeks we get nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bhroam</div><div class="date">03-06-2007, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I agree that some changes were needed.  I asked my prot-spec'd kara geared tank to come tank for us this weekend.  There were times I swapped forms to OT a mob on the healer.  I had a bit of rage left over, so I went over the MT's mob and burned it... a mangle and a maul later I had his mob on me.  I stopped everything except auto-attack and nothing short of a taunt got him the mob back.<br />
<br />
I do agree that when a tank is holding his own in dps with the dps classes, we're a bit over the top.<br />
<br />
I think the changes as went into 2.0.10 were nerfdom to hell.  They just recently added a hotfix in which helps out a lot.  They gave a 50% threat bonus to mangle and makes lacerate do a small amount of instant damage.  This allows us to use lacerate against bleed-immune creatures.<br />
<br />
So after all said and done, they've nerfed our damage, 1000HP, 1500 armor, but not our threat.  Threat is what you need as a tank.<br />
<br />
This does place feral druids back to our kicking bag status in PvP.  Balance is now our PvP tree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trixtaa</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whateverr happened to that fact that there was an imminenet bug with Bear Mangle if you had enough rage to pop Maul and then Mangle at the same time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">03-16-2007, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted that we needed to be nerfed.  I agree that our damage output in bear was not inline with our ability to mitigate.  What with the hotfix and some less than obvious gear choices, I feel like I barely lost anything at all from a tanking perspective.<br />
<br />
Most people complain about a lack of damage, but I didn't see that much of a decrease.  I was doing a great deal of my damage with shred and rips (where applicable).  The nerf to mangle wasn't the end-all for me.  (i hate mangle spamming).  As to the reduction in crit bonus, sure, it sucked.  But again, I wassn't relying on crits anyway.  I saw a very slight reduction in overall DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bryne</div><div class="date">03-29-2007, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see alot of conversation here about our damage...and I would have been fine with only a damage nerf as I felt we did an inappropriate amount of dps. However, I think there needs to be more thought about our stamina and armor loss. I am now seeing warriors with 13000+hp and 13000+ armor unbuffed. Part of being a bear was to be able to absorb more damage (since we donrt have a block or parry) now that we are getting to end game gear my fears and comments I made in earlier posts are starting to be realized. We were nerfed too soon to make changes this drastic. I do hope Blizz sees this and adjusts more than the tier gear (as they have stated they will do) and start to look at our skills and adjusts them accordingly since end game will be a whole different game than 5/10 mans now.</div></div><hr />
