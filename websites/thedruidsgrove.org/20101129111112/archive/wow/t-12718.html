Here is my armory link.<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Aggramar&amp;n=Kumorisenshi<br />
I also wanted toi say that the lower city prayer, book and the mercilous gladiators salvation will be added in the next few days if all goes well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Organtis</div><div class="date">07-06-2008, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like your off to a good start honestly, but i have a couple of suggestions<br />
<br />
1. you logged with your travel gear, so i dont have an accurate view of you.<br />
<br />
2. try to replace the couple &quot;of the owl&quot; with the physican or heiroplant.<br />
<br />
3. the pvp mace I am still using until i get the kara or badge one. 375+ healing on the s1 pvp mace is huge if your starting out. I dont remember what mercelless has on it.<br />
<br />
4. you should probably focus on +healing since your just starting out. You will probably not be the main healer until your around 1500 or greater in Kara.<br />
<br />
5. Your group will realy dictate how sucessful you will be. Including the other healers. I estimate that total kara needs +3000-3500 healing total. So if your around 1000 you need 2 others about the same. If your group wants to run with only 2 healers and the other one is not at least 2000 your in a wipefest.<br />
<br />
6. You can make it just dont plan on being #1</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">07-07-2008, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya.  You're fine.   Off to a good start actually.<br />
<br />
I don't know your Kara group and / or their experience, but the more practice with the mechanics of the fights you and your party have the easier it will get. <br />
<br />
As for drops, after several successful 1st half of Kara runs, you should be very well geared.  I recommend you save your honor points / badges to replace gear that simply won't drop for you. (Prince's Mace, for example).<br />
<br />
And +Healing is the ticket.  Mana will follow.  Use whatever gadgets you can to improve both.  Superior Mana Oil is one of my faves (cheaper than Flasks of Mighty Restoration - although they simply rock as well).  You can also use Elixirs and Fishsticks for extra boost, but depending on how many times you wipe, it can get expensive (if you're not an alchemist).  I prefer to use mine for boss fights only.<br />
<br />
Anyway...soon you'll have it on farm...and you're gonna love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it comes to pre-Kara gear, is +Spirit worthy of much consideration or is the inital drive simply to boost healing first and foremost? (or am I just misunderstanding Tree form at a basic level?)<br />
<br />
From my own guild's PoV were pretty much at Kara on farm although that doesn't mean I'm looking to boost the tree through it, we still need to carry out weight in there and I'm still a bit of gear short of reaching that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't get the prince-mace over the S2-mace.<br />
S2 is better in my opinion. I would never trade 25 spirit for 40 +heal</div></div><hr />

http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Aggramar&amp;n=Kumorisenshi<br />
I picked up the s2 mace and gloves. And have major heals enchants on both. my bh is now 1361 unbuffed.<br />
My co healer is a holy pally with over 1800 bh. My first kara run is this saturday. Just wonderin if yall think we'll be g2g for the run. thx for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">07-10-2008, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as raw stats for starting Kara, you are probably a little on the low side if you are dual-healing the entire instance.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of some pre-Kara resto by Bell over at 4Haelz ... I'd recommend you pick up some pieces where you are lacking (basically all of your greens :P):<br />
<br />
http://4haelz.blogspot.com/search/label/rl70<br />
<br />
Also, it is fairly important that you reach exalted with Honor Hold.  The head enchant gives you a pretty sizable boost (35 healing, 7 mp5), and you will be expected to have it as your progress deeper into endgame content.  If you manage to reach exalted with Cenarian Expedition you can also pick up the healing OH from them that will last you a good while.<br />
<br />
That's all I got for now ...  :)</div></div><hr />

Oops, you're right.  I was thinking about the Subtlety enchant.  :whistle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calon</div><div class="date">07-18-2008, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say as a rule, Kara should not be done in greens. So if you have any, stay away. But if you must, I'd say just one or at most two pieces green.<br />
As of today you are feral spec so I can't see the healy stuff. <br />
<br />
Ps - As for your feral gear, stay away from Kara. it will be more of a liability than an assest, unless people are carrying you on a freeloading kara run, then by all means go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-18-2008, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can be a &quot;front half&quot; Kara ready bear with just bit of gold and a little bit of PvP.  That is both a curse and a blessing.  As later in the raid progression it becomes more difficult to obtain pieces for bear.  But the instant you ding 70 (assuming you did your homework before hand), you can tank kara.  Well, you can have the gear to tank kara.  Doesn't mean you'll have the skills.</div></div><hr />
