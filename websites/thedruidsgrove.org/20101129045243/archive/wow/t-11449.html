Sure it made PvP gear a whole ton easier but know that in TBC, PvP rewards won't be as good as they are now. The best non-tier/raid gear will be in arena and that requires a team and rankings. Even then its not as good as the tier sets.<br />
<br />
It doesn't seem right that someone had to work for months to get a full 6piece set of gear and a handful of weapons. Raiders have it easy. Just raid a couple nights and quite often you're rewarded with loot for contributing to the group.<br />
<br />
Many HWLs(Rank14s) I knew on my server don't care too much. It still takes time to get these items. The only difference being its now about time investment and not time investment in short amounts of time.<br />
<br />
There are much more 'casuals' or those that can't devote time to raiding and can't work for PvP gear because they can't devote every day of the week.</div></div><hr />

I really have no problem with the changes.  People still need to PvP a lot to get a full set and a weapon.  Is it the same time investment?  No, but it was insane before.</div></div><hr />

I don't like seeing people running around with HWL weapons and green rings, but I think in a few weeks, very few people will care.</div></div><hr />
