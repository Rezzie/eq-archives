<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Glynna1</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Curious what have you been able to Charm in PoP. Was in Plane of Nightmare and a druid in my group used Call of Karana on a Blood raven. I have DC and tried to use it and it said the NPC was too high. Both of these Ravens were dark blue to me at 61. However the other druid tried to use Call of Karana on the one I tried to DC and it was too high also. Curious if Call of Karana can be used on a Blood Raven should DC also work? <br />
<br />
Also curious has anyone been able to charm any mobs in PoP. If so which mobs and which planes.<br />
<br />
Would like some help here. Thanks</div></div><hr />

The only things you will find to DC in Plane of Nightmare are young bats... usually you can find one or two on track from zone-in, but they're considerably weaker than everything else.  (but they still hit for 150 or so =p)</div></div><hr />

So only being able to charm young bats is not entirely accurate cause there is a few others you can charm in PoN. There may be others but my time there thus far has be limited</div></div><hr />

PoDisease is much easyer to kill in than PoN less lag, weaker mobs and more room to run around without worrying about agro. XP is very nice in PoDisease charm soloing. I can solo in PoD,PoN,and PoI We can probably solo in PoJ aswell (enforcers and Punishers dont summon and hit for 200, about 150 less than PoN and PoD and PoI, not too much HP either and drop Parchments) Just havent tried yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lotusfly Stewnicely</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, when one buys Dire Charm, the level 46 limit isn't a secret - you pretty much know what you're getting.  When you buy the skill, you're conscious of the fact that, with it, you'll be getting a risk-free pet which hits for around the 150 mark.<br />
<br />
You buy it not to solo with (unless you're porcupining, but Lord does that hurt in PoP), but to get 50-75 dps constant, risk-free, extra damage in a group.  Dire Charm is the grouping druid's dream come true.  Using it to &quot;ghetto-mez&quot; a slowed add, with Savage Spirit, oft-times by the time the group turns its attention to the target, your dire charmed pet has done a considerable amount of damage already, as well as keeping it &quot;mezzed&quot;, off the group.<br />
<br />
There's little more &quot;druidic&quot; than having an animal by your side to help you, whether it be to increase your damage constantly (a nice augmentation whilst mana is low, too), whether you use it to &quot;mez&quot; adds, or what-have-you.<br />
<br />
The pet has to hit for 150s - some call that &quot;wimpy&quot;, but a &lt;strong&gt;constant&lt;/strong&gt; source of 50+ dps, mana-independant, is certainly anything but wimpy, for a grouping druid.<br />
<br />
It's a nice compliment to the soloing druids Call-of-Karana style of play, too.  You can take the risk and indulge in a really nasty 255-hitting pet with a breakable charm solo, or you can go for the risk-free, mana-free 50dps dire charm if you're grouping.<br />
<br />
That's the great thing about druids - tons of different skills, and frequently each is applicable in different circumstances.  The fun part, and that which separates the veteran from the average, is learning which works out best in each situation.  <br />
<br />
I've heard that a good druid can really impress groups, and lead them to completely re-evaluate the class.  I wouldn't know, because I'm a bad druid, of course.  ^_))<br />
<br />
With PoP, I think that dire charm is one of the best uses of nine AA points that you can find.  Spirit of the Wood also costs nine points to max, and that's pretty darned helpful too.  The instant cast really makes it the go-to spell of choice when the going gets tough, and it's certainly saved groups that I've been with a number of times.  MGBing it on raids or trials, in which everyone is taking constant damage from some source, really is decent too.<br />
<br />
If you avoid the dodgy jokes from the men in your guild about &quot;wood&quot;, that it.  8(<br />

A bonus is you can actually equip these cute little guys with weapons such as those crappy paladin hammers that drop every 10 minutes.  For CoK fun try the Bubonic War Rats there :)</div></div><hr />

They were easy to find.  Look on track and find a light blue rat.   Kind of small though but it was still mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you cannot solo with it!  But it adds a very nice amount to the dps of your group.<br />
<br />
I did 14 hours of straight XP in PoV with 1 group and a DC pet yesterday.   uggg. =D.  VERY VERY VERY Happy to have DC'able pets in every zone.  I think Verant did a very good balance job with it.  It's great fun to have a DC pet and adds a good about of dps to a GROUP.   You certiantly are NOT gonna solo with a DC pet in these places.   So it's forcing grouping.   However, the wizards and some druids and their quad kiting.   UGGG  wish they would go away.   My group was pulling constant yellows and reds (to level 62) and here comes quad_kiter_02 with a train of blues right through the middle of our camp.<br />
<br />
PoV was truely ruined yesterday with people doing /auctions and quadding.   WTF people this is suppose to be a PLANE not fricken Velks or Karnor Castle.<br />
<br />
Well, I should be level 63 by tomorrow and have level 1 of all the useful PoP AA's as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I already moved out of PoN due to silly crap and quadders to PoV, only took 2 days for the same newbs to make it to PoV.  Guess it's time to get tagged for the next teir quick before the newbs catch up again  =/.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DigginsEQ</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try the Plane of Storms.  You won't see any quad kiters there as most of the mobs summon.  And yes, avoid the Plane of Disease like the plagues it's named after.  It seems as though every single idiot from Karnor Castle, Velketor and Maiden's Eye has descended upon this zone en masse.  I cringe every time I need to zone in there because the chances are there's a huge train at the zone in.  I officially declare the Plane of Disease as the KC 2.0 of PoP!</div></div><hr />
