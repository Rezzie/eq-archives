There's no chance of getting it restored.  All you have left is your empty account and the friends you've made.  What do you do?<br />

*edit*  since this thread became active I tried to insert a poll, but cant seem to do it...  seems like you can only start a poll with a new thread.<br />

Personally I'd talk to a few guildmates that I know are sitting on multiple accounts from people who have quit EQ about taking over one of the accounts. That would give me a level 65, flagged and geared up character to attend raids with. Then I could work on leveling up another character of my choice in my non-raid time.</div></div><hr />

Now, Would I create a druid again? I don't know. I'd just have to sit and think about what my opinions are of all the classes and if I'd rather go a different direction the second time.</div></div><hr />

I love Des to death, but honestly i wish i was a_random_hybrid_03.  Been playing a ranger twink and he just seems to suit my fancy more.</div></div><hr />

Cool as they look, the experience penalty is too brutal.</div></div><hr />

I've put too much of *me* into my druid over the last 4&amp;1/2 years. My level doesn't show it, but I spend most of my time working on AA's, tradeskills, helping others with non-exp quests, etc. Just the thought of starting over depresses me. &lt;G&gt;</div></div><hr />
