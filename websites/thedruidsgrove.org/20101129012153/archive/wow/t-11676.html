<br />
Zachary Miner, a graduate student at the State University of New York at Albany, is doing research on people who spend lots of time playing MMORPGs to see what effect, if any, it has on other parts of their lives (family, work, school, etc.). Your responses will be of great help in understanding the MMORPG phenomenon.<br />
<br />
The requirements for participation in this study are:<br />
<br />
1) You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age<br />
2) You must currently spend a significant amount of your free time (around 20 hours per week, or more) playing MMORPGs, or have done so at some point in the past.<br />
<br />
If you meet these requirements and want to participate right now, just visit http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=546013543771 to take the survey!<br />
<br />
