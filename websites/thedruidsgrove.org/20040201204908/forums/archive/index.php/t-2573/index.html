<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know how much is the going price for Mask of the Forest?<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any one for sale at the bazaar. =(<br />
<br />
It seems so rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kuolon No Surname</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">12-14k on Fennin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No idea here. price here is kinda crazy. I am guessing 14 k range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I have seen it has been as much as 50k on Seventh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I paid something like 40k a while back.  Of course at that time nearly every spell was at least that much, as we had only one, maybe two guilds in the elementals (and other zones still had flag restrictions, and named mobs still dropped nothing half the time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh well, I guess discussing the pc on this spell is pretty moot.  I really can't find it in the bazaar for the past 3 months.  So, i'm guessing its a really expensive spell.  If I find one at 14k as posted earlier, i'll be one happy tree hugger.<br />
<br />
With the rarity of this spell in the market, i wouldn't be surprised about the 40k price posted earlier.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, I saw a mask of the stalker going for 26k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gael Stormracer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Isn't that insane? On Antonius Bayle, I bought Mask of the Stalker for 10k a couple of months back, I'm almost certain it was a researched copy, and I thought that reasonable. As far as I can tell, what Mask of the Forest gives over that is 1 more Mana per tick and See Invis... is that worth such a huge pile of cash?<br />
<br />
Personally, I currently have only Bot9 and Destroy Summoned as level 65 spells, and I am in no hurry to go buy the remainder, not even Winter's Frost since these days my primary role is as a Healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pherrot69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">goes for about 100k on Tallon Zek, thats IF you can find it.  So depends on the server id say</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">On 7th Stalker still goes for 20k.  Mask of the Forest usually shows up for around 30-40k (though sometimes higher as Greggo said).<br />
<br />
My guild has turned in oh probably about 25 runes for druids at this stage and to date we have only received one copy of Forest.<br />
<br />
On the plus side we have no problems getting Bot9 and Winter's Frost, though....</div></div><hr />
