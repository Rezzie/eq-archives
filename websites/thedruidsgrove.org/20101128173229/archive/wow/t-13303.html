<br />
<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
2-piece: The periodic damage done by your Rake, Rip, and Lacerate abilities has a chance to cause you to enter a Clearcasting state.<br />
<br />
4-piece: Increases the duration of Savage Roar and Survival Instincts by 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Amazing for cats. Garbage for bears. The cat DPS rotation (insofar as never letting any of several debuffs drop could be called a rotation) is very difficult, and an additional 8 seconds on Savage Roar plus the chance of a Clearcasting proc is huge.<br />
<br />
For bears, both are underwhelming, especially once you've seen the Warrior 4-piece Tier 8 bonus. For raid tanking, you're generally not going to face a low-rage situation, and this is all the more true once you factor in the armor nerf and rage gain even while shielded. An additional 8 seconds on Survival Instincts falls pretty squarely into the category of &quot;nice,&quot; but not exactly game-breaking. You'll be using Tier 8 for the stat bonuses over Tier 7 and certainly not for the set bonuses, although the transition should be relatively easy because Tier 7's set bonuses are also kind of meh.<br />

When will blizzard through in the towel on the &quot;Feral&quot; vs Bear/Kitty??  I swear, its like comprimising with my wife!  I take a stand(bear), she makes a stand(kitty)...and they we meet...about 90% of the way twords her!  (to be fair, its usually cause she's right! But that doesn't really fit the example I am trying to make.)  <br />
<br />
But still, every &quot;shared&quot; item is hugely favored for kitty use, and darn near useless for Bears.  It was nice of them to buff our lowest damage ability (yes, lower than &quot;swing&quot;) to make it a bit less useless (still falling squarely in the &quot;only to buff maul&quot; category)  And give us NO ADDITIONAL MITIGATION/AVOIDANCE!!!  (That still is the main goal of a tank...right?)<br />
<br />
Clearcasting - Yes, while taking extra hard hits (more than before), we now have the ability to maintain a rage bar that is already always full....thanks blizz.  :gunfight:</div></div><hr />

Warm up your QQ fellas (and ladies)<br />
<br />
The non teir pieces as thus far released are hard core DPS.<br />

Infact most of the uldaur 10 items are not upgrades for a bear being that they severely gimped the Agi/stam itemization in favor of raw AP/Hit/Crit.  Depending on how SD shapes up, this may make the items more favorable, but our Health pools will severly pay the price for the extra AP.   As it stands now, they will have to pry my Origin of Nightmare from my cold dead fingers before I will part with it!  (yes, dropped three weeks in a row, and I finally got it.  (being the 3rd feral, only tank...my dice/bad loot policy couldn't keep me down forever)</div></div><hr />
