Single Direwild won't overwrite group.<br />

Guildy tells you: Kan, can I get Oak Bro?<br />

/r Sure, inc.<br />
 <br />

Guildy tells you: Thanks Bro. :)<br />

/r You're killing me... won't stick on you, are you buff locked?<br />
<br />
Guildy tells you: Nope, I got room... I have Oak, has 32 mins on it, from this morning.<br />
<br />
/r Click it off, it's prolly the group buff.<br />

Guildy tells you: Single don't overwrite group? that's BS. <br />

Some of our new spells just suck, we lost upgrades to our DoTs, yadda yadda. I'm thinking of trying WoW to solo when I only have an hour or so.</div></div><hr />

You, a Level 74 with the same exact spell and lasts the same ammount of time or greater, will not over-ride the higher level persons buff.</div></div><hr />

I have had a level 70 Enchanter &quot;do me a favor&quot; and overwrite someone elses extended KEI with their unextended one.  Since I can't cast it on myself, I just said thank you and tried not to cry.</div></div><hr />
