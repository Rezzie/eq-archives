<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nuppin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what some high end druid legs would be? Mostly looking for dropable ones or easy quest. Right now I have SS legs and could get ornate but I have to trade +mana for +hp then :(  and I have not found any with good hp and mana. I'm in a raiding in guild (in elem planes) btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went ahead and put on a pair of Earthweave leggings.  They are droppable and the components arent too bad to farm with a group.  They (iirc) were ever so slightly less mana than the ss legs I had (like by 20) but lots more hp, and since I can never use all my mana anyway...  :cool: <br />
<br />
Skipped the ornate legs cause I thought they were pretty ho hum.  May get ele legs some day but in no particular hurry.<br />
<br />
Only other nice ones that come to mind are the leggings of judgement from VT.  Nice chain look, but nodrop.<br />

<br />
I have a pair and they run 135/140 hp/mana ish.<br />
<br />
They cost about 1/2 the price of elemental legs in my guild.<br />

Got these when I was in HoH, dropped off 1 of the Named Captains spawn that spawns in the shrine near HoHB portal to the left.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stormfront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am using Ornate Leggings.<br />
<br />
My guild is VT and EP enabled, so eventually I hope to upgrade to the seaweed pants from the &quot;Mighty&quot; PoW mini.  Honestly, I likely wouldn't take the elemental leggings as an upgrade since I love the right clicky root.  Basically, to go from SS legs to Ornate legs, I lost 10 mana and gained about 35 hps iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">..I was not certain how I felt about em at first but I eventually caved and got em. They go cheap in my guild.<br />
<br />
No regrets.  In spite of the lack of wisdom and low mana, the stats are great.  <br />
<br />
And the effect is just super.  Love the fast evacs/gates, and the 2.6sec NI's.</div></div><hr />

heehee...when I was associated with BotS, these dropped for me and I submitted'em to Alla's and magelo. May have been a serverwide first, but I doubt it. =)<br />
<br />
But I'm surprised you say they are now dropping in HoH - crazy</div></div><hr />

I used to be a mana person, always looked for mana first.  But now, hps have become more important.  Of course I only go for items that are about equal in hp/mana and opt for the effect and resists over all.  But I have to say that I think hps are overall more important if you're in a guild that kills a lot of mobs that have aoe's.  If you're in the elementals, you'll encounter lots of aoe mobs and the more hp's you have, the more it helps you and the raid as a whole (so no one's burning mana and time trying to heal you constantly).  Of course higher resists could help this as well but some aoe's are impossible or close to impossible to resist, so in that case higher hps would help.  If you're in the elementals I don't see how this should be an issue anyway.  You'll eventually have 100+hp/mana in ever slot.  I quickly ditched my ss legs when pop came out for ornate ones.  Why not if they're free from my guild?  I sacraficed 10mana for 35hps and stats and a neat effect.  I probably wouldn't bother at this point though if you can simply get elemental legs or seaweed legs though.  For me I know it will be awhile before I get any since we have yet to see leather legs drop and lots of leather wearers to equip.</div></div><hr />

That +15 STA gives you about +45 HP, making these +95 HP leggings, about 30 more than the Ornate legs.</div></div><hr />
