Even though they wear mail, I have an easier time taking them down compared to warlocks.  A couple of ravages and shreds = dead hunter if they don't react quicly and continue shooting away.  If they try to fend me off, then at least they won't be doing massive ranged damage to my allies during this time.</div></div><hr />

To be honest its hard to &quot;quantify&quot; this type of information. It varies based on the situation we are in. But in general, i can say 90% of the time, priest first.</div></div><hr />

If not I like to go after hunters also. Rogues were first on my list but hunters have taken the top spot for me. Especially the ones that drop down and exploit line of sight.</div></div><hr />

It depends according to what's going on at the moment.  If there is alot of AoE, then mages first, if the Warriors are pushing through then Priests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">12-28-2005, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me it really depends on the situation.  I was doing some WSG last night....and I tried to kill the priests and warlocks first.  This one 'lock was spamming fear and driving my teammates crazy.  Lately though I've been the one the other team tries to kill first....mainly because I've been getting a lot of flag caps in WSG and making them mad with my lovely roots.<br />
<br />
Now if there are 2 certain people on the other team...I have to get them first....just because I enjoy killing them so much (and my bf has joined me in this).  Funny thing is one is a druid.  Haha.</div></div><hr />
