<br />
Right now I am at 22k armor, around 14k health, and 21% dodge. My defense is 390, with resiliency making up the rest to make me uncrittable. 2 pieces left to upgrade for gear are wrists and hands. I also have some gems to change out.<br />
<br />
Are there any decent + agility/+ stamina gems?<br />
<br />
With enchants should i focus more on agility or go with more stamina.<br />
<br />
For example.....chest 150 health or +6 all stats?<br />
Boots: agility or stamina?<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I looked around here some and did not see quite what i was looking for. However it was a half arsed search.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

While I don't see anything on enchants, I highly recommend both the above blog and http://bigbearbutt.blogspot.com/ for feral tanks.  Lots of good information that is well written.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also generally prefer +stam over agility.  With Nax and beyond, what kills tanks is not sustained damage over time, but burst damage, and the more stam you have to buffer that burst and your 0 hp mark, the more time your healers have to react and get you back up to or near full hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+6 all stats to chest,<br />
<br />
Agil everywhere else,<br />
<br />
those +4gil/+4stam are good for blue slots,<br />
<br />
Just check this out, basically you need more dodge, <br />
