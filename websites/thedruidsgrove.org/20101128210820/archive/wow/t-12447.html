I will be one of the OTs for the Hydross fight and have read that I should Have 150 Nature and 150 Frost resistance.  I know about the nature and frost resist rings which each have +35 to them, my question is what is best to use to make up the rest?  Any OTs from SSC I would really appreciate a reply with what you used and how well it worked.  I have linked my stats and gear to take a look.  Thanks. <br />

If you are off tanking the adds, just wear your tank gear. they should have a hunter in your group and it's enough nature protection!<br />
<br />
Also the feral staff drops all the time off the mobs in SSC!!!!!<br />
<br />
The big thing is the timing to get the adds and bring them to one spot and AOE down.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />
