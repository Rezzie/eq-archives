My play time is Sun-Tues basically. I started my weekend as Dreamstate. during the day I run 5 mans with another guild. Since they have a new 70 priest my heals were no longer needed. And I started doing dps with them. My DPS was really low. At the moment I had no clear plans on how I was going to get to heroics or kara. So I respecced Full Blown boomkin. Still had some gearing issues, but saw a nice improvement in DPS. <br />
Made a trip to the AH and fix myself up as well as I could. <br />
So Sunday nite Im waddling around Nagrand, and get a pst from an guild officer. &quot;what are your plans for kara&quot; After a lengthy discussion about the chances of being a healer. Kinda slim. He asks if I would or could become an offtank. Im like sure I can but I have no gear or real knowledge to Tank. I kitty dps'd in 5 mans leveling up. So he offers the Heavy Clefthoof set to me. I run a couple of heroics to get some more tanky stuff. Monday I wake up and start farming mats for  the Cleft stuff. Blow some more $$ in the AH for feral stuff. nothing amazing just enough to get me back to feral. Monday nite I get asked by the GM if I can help her out with some questing. She is a Resto druid(alt). We get to chatting about stuff and I tell her about the OT tank thing. So I respec to feral. I love kitty form. Tuesday nite is group 2 kara nite. Im still farming my butt off to get the leather I need. After maintaince  I get yet another whisper asking if Im doing Kara later. I said I wasnt really ready yet. Then the Bomb is dropped on me. &quot;So could you heal Kara tonight? :rolleyes: I had 1k healing before respec. Just a bit low. Up and back with guild chat and I get some enchants and a few no stat +heals gear. +1157 heals. <br />
90 mins before Kara Im in Thunder Bluff again for respec #3<br />
TOL now :wavey: <br />
We got to Shade when we lost our main tank to mommy aggro. <br />
all in all it worked out well, as a bonus I was able to get all the  blue and purple leather drops. <br />
My head is still spinning. But I love my druid!!<br />
I think Im gonna stay as a tree for a few weeks.. or at least I think I am..</div></div><hr />

So that was essentially 150g spent respeccing in less then 9 hours play time. whole day of dailies...poofed.</div></div><hr />

The other night when we were raiding SSC I tanked Hydross during the Nature phase then respecced to heal for the Leo and Lurker fights then respecced again to tank the Shaman for the Karathress fight.<br />
<br />
With all the new dailies gold isn't much of an issue anymore.  The pain is carrying too many gear sets and not having any open bag slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AMEN...<br />
<br />
while i've only respec'd three times (the first was a mistake, i was trying to unlearn a proffession while being a complete noob) and one of those was a free respec (i think when BC was released) i have 4 sets of gear currently that i carry at all times:<br />
<br />
Tanking gear<br />
Kitty gear<br />
Healing gear<br />
PvP gear<br />
<br />
I've thought about respeccing to resto to check it out, and while im curious about boomkin, the need for 5 sets of gear (7 if i plan to PvP with any other spec) doesn't really appeal to me, as i have the maximum slots for all my bags, and only my backpack is available for carrying loot. <br />
<br />
and yes, i've already made the mistake of clicking on my itemrack while having my bank open (god it was a nightmare getting everything sorted back out) lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes Thats where my pain was. <br />
Also I am newly 70, So respeccing 3x in 3 days was not normal for me. <br />
Guess its time for me to get closetgnome</div></div><hr />
