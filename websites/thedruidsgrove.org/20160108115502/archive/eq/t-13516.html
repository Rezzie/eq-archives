Not Just for Raiding but normal XP/group types</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems individual keyed top XP zones and DZ raids are the most favored atm <br />
<br />
Just a side note.. that I haven't voted on any of this and probably won't unless it fills up some just to get an idea of how others feel about the top XP/Raid zones.<br />
<br />
Persoanlly I hate DoN raids because of the lockouts same with some of the PoR stuff.  Tasks are teh suck imo.</div></div><hr />

Last thing I enjoy seeing is &quot;TRAIN TO ZONE OMGZ&quot; particularly when my group is doing stuff near said zone-out.<br />
<br />
About the whole locking the task/zone thing, it's not a bad thing to lock tasks so every player has to do the whole thing or run across a really nice group that says &quot;I don't mind if you sit afk in Plane of Knowledge while the other 5 people in group do all the work to flag you.&quot;  The downside to this, is a lot of loot will rot if other people can't be brought in.  Rot loot imo, is better going to an alt or app than just rotting, seems pretty pointless to let it sit on the corpse for 30 minutes when it's an upgrade for ~somebody~ whether they're in task/exped or not.</div></div><hr />
