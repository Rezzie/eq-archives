Wasn't it due to the elite mele procs off a scimitar of the mistwalker? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lotusfly Stewnicely</div><div class="date">01-07-2004, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bear in mind that this was before primal weaponary, which made having a high dex (to proc the Mistwalker) pretty tricky, especially when one is going for mana/hp (as pre-requisite in a contest in which one may not meditate).  Flowing Thought hadn't been introduced either!  Equipment choices were very limited.<br />
<br />
  I went the Mistwalker route, but was nearly convinced that it would have been better to use the Naturewalker's Scimitar exclusively (which was the best melee ratio at the time), which most people opted for.  <br />
<br />
  The low proc. rate of the Mistwalker over an entire fight (which was a considerable time in the slow old druid contest!) meant that it was more efficient to chop away with the Good Old Epic - on average.  Certainly, there is nothing discounting a run of good luck with Mistwalker procs, but that's a tricky decision to make.  Playing it again, I would have been tempted to bag the Mistwalker. ^_^<br />

Now there's a question for you ... How would you play BotB today?  Full Time gear and all that.<br />
<br />
I suspect our spells are all but useless since most Time level druids are running around with 250 MR/FR/CR before buffs and about 6khp self buffed.  There are several nice weapons that a druid could use as well.  We have the Terris Thule hammer with the unresistable 1500 proc, we have clicky lure DoTs, we have the greatstaff of smacking and we can covert our grimmel earring into a pet weapon which doubles for 450.<br />
<br />
I suppose it MAY be possible for a druid to kill another druid with just DoTs but like the original BotB, it came down to elite melee skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stand corrected.  I was thinking of the elemental god's essence quest that can be recycled (ala white dragonscale boots).  One of the rewards for that quest creates a 1HB weapon that procs call of the ancients.</div></div><hr />

Hrmmm ... I keep messing up on my stats.  Yeah, it's 750 damage.  I keep spell damage spam off but crit damage on.  So I only see the 1500 crits.</div></div><hr />

Funnily enough, little has changed in how I imagine a modern Best-of-the-Best tournament may take place.  Now, as then, damage spells would be a waste of mana and thus casting damage (either by direct damage, or by damage-over-time), would cause you to run dry compared to an opponent that kept their mana for heals.<br />
<br />
Now, as then, I see it coming down to a sneaky configuration of dummy self-buffs and damage shields, in order to try and keep one's opponent melee'ing into thorns.  <br />
<br />
Mana would be spent now, as then, on maintaining that sneaking buff configuration of dummy buffs and damage shields, whilst trying to keep the opponents damage shield off with dispells, and saving as much mana as possible for healing spells.<br />
<br />
The more things change, the more they stay the same.  ^_))<br />

We have DS clickies in the form of coldain ring (insta-cast) and pants (1 sec cast).  We can get innate DS from shield of pain LDoN items.  A fully dispelled druid can maintain ~50 DS just from clickies and innate DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lotusfly Stewnicely</div><div class="date">01-09-2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There was no clicking items in Best-of-the-Best Tournaments, recall.  <br />
<br />
The baby innate damage shield plus whatever one can keep up inbetween low-mana, quickly-casting dummy buffs are all that one can manage, if the original rules are followed in this &quot;What If&quot;.   ^_^<br />
<br />
Consider how many hit points, and how much mana, druids had before entering Sleeper's Tomb, which was roughly the time at which the tournaments took place (and long before the Temple of Veeshan).  Then, compare those numbers with the total of a druid that is finishing the Plane of Time raids in modern Everquest.  The damage:delay ratio on weaponary has gone up, but the caps on druid melee skills mean that this is still (now, as then), going to be a long, long battle.  ^_))<br />
<br />
Even damage spells which are less resistant than normal (lure-based swarms) disadvantage the caster compared to the canny opponent that saves mana for heals.  Every swarm cast is another nail in the caster's coffin, even if it lands on the target!<br />
<br />
In fact, swarms are just another dummy buff.  Perhaps you might remember leaving Buff Slot 1 free in the original tournaments, so that opponents could cast a swarm into it... and then chuckle as they dispelled it soon afterwards, in attempts to remove your damage shield (a fun moment). ^_^<br />
<br />
Despite AA abilities and recent equipment additions, I imagine that a modern-day tournament would look exceedingly familiar to those that remember the original event.  ^_))<br />

<br />
The event might take place with the same strategies as before, but the number of possible entries will be fewer as I believe there will be less druids with top end gear than there were with pre-sleepers/NToV gear back when the original event took place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure it would be too much fun now though, the gear disparities are simply too great for the &quot;common&quot; person to have a fighting chance.<br />
<br />
Anyone witnessed the Shammy BoTB on test? was watching it over a friends screen, at that point fungi tunics where allowed in the turney(the reason they disallowed em im sure), Two trolls going at it for like 40+ minutes, think the barbies and ogurs had had like 3 rounds solved in the time those two fought - GMs finally had mercy on em and took away their fungi tunics to get it settled - was hillarious :D<br />

It was a lot of fun the first time around, and I really enjoyed seeing some of the big names of the time on Test, but now, only a small handful of Druids per server would have a chance of competing.  (Unlike then, when we had level 59's (me as one) and even a level 56 or 57 red-server fellow on test).  Druids in smaller guilds that didn't do an awful lot of raiding actually had a chance, long as they had spent a lot of time practicing.  (Those who were extremely well geared and didn't practice died in record time though).<br />
<br />
Now?  It would seem like it's 95% about the gear, and only about the tactics between those who are similarly equipped.</div></div><hr />

Just wanted to pop in and mention that's not quite true, I remember fighting against someone with a Primal 2hb stick, so they were definetly available at the time, though pretty rare to spot one on a druid.<br />

Druid vs. Druid comes down to a mostly melee battle, with damage done through clickies (thorns/dots), and mana saved solely for heals.  Tossing an ensnare every so often doesn't hurt either - sure it will be resisted 95% of the time, but it's basically free to cast and always has a small chance to land on people even with 500 MR (don't bank on it landing even once, but every time I've landed it on someone = duel over).<br />
<br />
Fights can literally last an hour when it's two healing classes going at it... with all the FT, mana pres, healing AAs and huge mana pools players have now.<br />
<br />
Hammer of Hours is pretty nice for dueling, but Dark Mace of Thought from VT is pure win (procs Theft of Thought) if you're dueling someone with a mana pool.</div></div><hr />

I was in the arena battleing a rogue, given he had 350+ unbuffed MR...I never landed Time Lapse a single time. (his magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=228404))<br />

Not to forget, meleeing another druid, if they have damage shield up, 60+ DS every hit, I suppose its not much but over time that will add up!</div></div><hr />
