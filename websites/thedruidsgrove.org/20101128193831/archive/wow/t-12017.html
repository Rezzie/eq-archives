<br />
Will my Druid trainer give me the quest?  <br />
<br />
Is it at level 68?  <br />
<br />
Did you all solo it?  Or should I grab a buddy?<br />
<br />
I need to train my riding skill to 150 + be exalted with Darnassus (Night Elf)?  <br />
<br />
Finally, after you received your flight form, did any of you bother to get another mount (for outside of Outlands)?<br />
<br />
Think I'm done now :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Walk up to the trainer<br />
- Pay Gold<br />
- Go to Outlands<br />
- Fly<br />
<br />
;)  There's no quest for flight form, just for swift flight form ( epic flight speed ).<br />
<br />
Yes you need your epic ground mount training first, but you should have easily made enough gold for that by now.  No, you don't need to be exalted with Darnassus, you only need exalted with a faction that is NOT your home to get a mount from them.<br />
<br />
Finally, you can't use the flying mounts or flight form anywhere besides Outlands ( ie. no flying in Azeroth ), so you'll have to keep that ground mount around for a while.</div></div><hr />

LOL...<br />
I still have 3k gold to go for the 300 riding skill so I can begin the epic flight form quest :(</div></div><hr />

3k??? For Epic???  NO Way!  Seriously?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Got that right!<br />
<br />
As for 5000g for Epic - I'd better get started!  <br />
<br />
Sigh, I will miss my family though.:p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">09-06-2007, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Daily quests FTW! Do the Sons of Gruul quests (starts in Shatt at the big ogre by the reagent vendor in Lower City, requires group of 5 for an hour or so), get your Ogri'la rep started and start doing the four dailies there (after some other quests). Every day you do them you'll net almost 50g, 45 Apexis shards, and about 700 rep with Ogri'la and Shat'ari Skyguard (both have some good rewards at exalted) in addition to whatever drops that you can sell in the AH. You can also start doing the Shartuul event, which can drop the Badge of Tenacity but is very difficult.<br />
<br />
I also do the dailies in Skettis- the bombing run and the escort quest when it's available- for another 12-24 gold. What other dailies do you all do that are worthwhile?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">09-06-2007, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Netherwing dailies are also good for cash. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you aren't 70 yet...here's a good way to make the cash.<br />
<br />
DO NOT DO ONE QUEST in Shadowmoon Valley or Netherstorm before hitting 70.<br />
<br />
Should be able to get to 68-69 in Nagrand alone. Then just run Shadow Labs a few times for loot+experience.<br />
<br />
Then blitz through every quest you can pick up in SMV and Netherstorm.<br />
<br />
Netherstorm itself yields over 3000G at 70 if you do every single quest.<br />
<br />
Enjoy Epic Flight Form.</div></div><hr />

At that time I had only made 3-4 instances runs in the Outlands.<br />
<br />
That leaves 2.5+ zones worth of quests yet to complete.  I'm sure something similar will happen with my Druid.  My biggest fear is that the next Xpac will be released before I reach lvl 70.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I have worked my self to exalted in a couple of factions by grinding instances ...</div></div><hr />

epic flying mount - 200gp<br />
<br />
skygaurd quests - 2 in skett (escort, bombing) 2 blade (bomb, wrangle)<br />
ogri'la quests - 1 attunement (simon says crystals) 1 slay the demonds (kill demon types near portals)<br />
<br />
skygaurd quests - 4 total - 12gp each = 48gp<br />
ogri'la quest - 2 total - 12gp each = 24gp<br />
<br />
bored person with 2 hours (give or take a hour based on server and evil anal turdmongers that ambush you durring quests) you can clear 72gp on average a day, only 2 quests involve actual combat, so subtract the 2gp for repairs and you clear 70gp a day just doing dailies.<br />
<br />
now on the same note, there are 3 repeatable quests (group quests) that pay between 15-20 gp each.  (dragon killing is my favorite, kill all 5 dragons in blades edge, combine scales, turn in for Apex Crystal, and get about 300-1000 rep and about 20 gp in loot if not better)</div></div><hr />
