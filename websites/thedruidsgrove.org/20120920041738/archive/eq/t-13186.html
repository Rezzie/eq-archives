Spell Casting Subtley as number one.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but I found that a no brainer.  I would always get summoned / attacked for healing people.<br />
<br />
Luckily, they have fixed aggro a bit, made the mobs not assist as much and I now group with tanks that have aggro weapons / AAs (pick any of these, I just know it is better), but still...</div></div><hr />

If in POV then go for the healing line -- there are no/few summoners. However if you group at OOW zones, go for the subtley line. <br />
 <br />
Secondary Forte is very useful. I personally think it's a must have.<br />
 <br />
Radiant cure -- I'll go for level 1 only. It's rarely used but if you don't have it then you are not a complete druid.<br />
 <br />
Combat agility -- really no idea how good it is.<br />
 <br />
(Corrected a mistake. Thought secondary forte was secondary recall lol)</div></div><hr />

If you start raiding i sugest to build it up to resplendend cure III. In this case it will cancle most detrimental effects.<br />
 <br />
For group situations i will take Spell Casting Subtley first, followed by RC and AHA2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuppet</div><div class="date">01-27-2006, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Spell Casting Subtley - nice aggro reduction!  but typically need at least rank 2 before you start to see its benefits.  downside to this AA is that it's expensive.<br />
<br />
2.  Advanced Healing Adept 2 - we need all the help we can get in healing.  this is line is well worth the cost.<br />
<br />
3. Combat Agility - you won't see its benefits until you get attacked but it can mean the difference between life and death.  avoidance AA's are your friend.<br />
<br />
4.  Secondary Forte (current primary specialization is evocation) - i haven't found enough feedback to convince me of its benefits (yet).  if you have the aa's to spare, ok np, but as a budding druid i think you can get by without it.<br />
- bump this up in priority if you find yourself doing more group stuff and play the healer - since you are evocation druid.<br />
<br />
5. Radiant Cure - you won't be using it often in exp groups (or solo).  but awesome ability.  you can get by with only possessing one rank until you start raiding more frequently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">01-30-2006, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would go for level 70 first. Or if your group is level 61-65 then.. i don't know. The AA for spell casting subtlety is probably equal to you gaining 2-3 levels..<br />
 <br />
But if you insist on doing AAs then .. as a soloer none of these help you, except maybe combat agility. If you do group, then first thing is spell casting subtlety tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say that Radiant Cure is actually really useful, even in single group content. Gets rid of tash, and minor stuff that casters will cast on you in 65+ content.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Couldn't agree more, curing tash is prolly the number 1 &quot;grouping&quot; use for RC, hah.   As a raiding druid it's vital but certainly handy for grouping/soloing.</div></div><hr />

As for the aa's you listed, ca is the only one that will really help soloing.  I'd go:<br />

It has a 'remove detrimental' component that becomes vital on many raids.<br />
<br />
SCS3 is very important if you plan on raiding. Most of the other healers/casters will have SCS3 so when your heals/debuffs land you will get aggro. It's not just mobs that summon either. On multi mob pulls, if the offtanks don't grab the extra mobs in time, they will eat you for lunch in the blink of an eye.<br />
<br />
Only worry about gift/adept lines once you get the other fundamental ones. They will basically save you mana or increase crit heals (which is nice, but random and in general not very useful because they are random). If you get killed and you still have mana, then those points would have been better spent on SCS3 or Silent Casting.<br />
<br />
I am all about big mana pools, so I like Innate Enlightenment and Chaotic Potential (and the DoN AA) to get my WIS to 415.<br />
<br />
Also shared camo is great for raids. An instant-fixed-20minute-group invis? Expensive but vital.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erikochan</div><div class="date">02-26-2006, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my prioritylist, without being overly nice about it. I know for sure many druids will disagree on me putting SCS at lowest rank, but then again those are probably the same druids with Dire Charm trained when it had already become an obsolete AA.<br />
<br />
1 Radiant Cure - Get this at rank 1. It's cheap, it's handy, it makes the &quot;omg I'm tashed and it WILL kill me&quot; lamers shut up without having to pureblood them manually, which imo is priceless.<br />
<br />
2 Advanced Healing Adept 2 - Bigger heals is higher survivability groupwise, and it can't hurt when soloing either :)<br />
<br />
3 Combat Agility - Because you say you solo, having some points in CA is good to have, you basically can't go wrong with this either if you prioritise this or not. The true druid doesn't get hit :P<br />
<br />
4 Secondary Forte (current primary specialization is evocation) - Your specialisation should be Alteration, unless you really want to remain a soloing druid. Having Evoc as your specialisation means you're basically useless in grouping situations when **** hits the fan. Our healing when it's put to the endurance test is expensive enough as-is.<br />
<br />
5 Spell Casting Subtlety - The overrated AA. This spell will only save you if your tank sucks or someone else screws up, most of the time being the puller. If you're like me, then be oldskool and don't put up with the crap tanks/pullers/noob groups give you. Give them an ultimatum : Shape up, or ship out. We don't have to deal with eBay/MM people, it's called freedom of choice. However, if you've already trained your entire heal lines, spirit of the grove, RC6, quickened curing 3 (winner on raids, every priest should get this), and basically all USEFUL AAs, then this might be an option to consider as one fellow druid pointed out to me : It means you can nuke more without getting summoned (low priority since druids aren't (high) dps, but nice) :)<br />
<br />
PS I'm a big sucker for utility and speedy ups - so Exodus, Innate Camou, Quickened Evac, Quick Damage 3 (but not Hastened Exodus out of crap group principle), Secondary Recall and Origin are high on my list. Anything to make druid life a little bit more comfy :)</div></div><hr />
