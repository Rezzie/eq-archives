Have decided on this (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGMsfrz0eo0GkAZ0E0z) as my starting build.  I maxed out PvE kitty dps, and I think I should be able to tank regular instances with this.  We shall see, but I hope the patch does go live, I'm ready for it already.</div></div><hr />

They were running fine.  I'm thinking next week (7th) or even the week after (14th).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">09-30-2008, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely not today, the login screen would have said there would be extended maintenance and the forums would have announced the patch today ( they always announce big patches ).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing more on the 14th, 30 days before WotLK, which IIRC, was just like it was prior to BC.</div></div><hr />

I think hunters got a re-write in this last build.  Especially MM hunters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-01-2008, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't equate PTR builds with Beta builds... the PTR will not change nearly as much as the beta at this point.  PTR got a new build this week so we need to see how that goes, but we'll see a TON of changes after we get the patch that you'll have to wait till WotLK to get in game.  They did the same thing with BC.</div></div><hr />

We&#8217;re currently planning to end the fourth Arena season on October 14, 2008, and as always -- this date could easily change. This Arena Season is only ending in respect to the ladder, meaning we'll be taking a snapshot of the season's ladder and then go through our normal process to determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards. This process should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the arena-specific title and/or Armored Nether Drake to refrain from transferring their character to another realm between the date outlined above, and when the end-of-season rewards are physically awarded.<br />
<br />
Upon the end of this Arena Season, teams and ratings will not be wiped, and will carry forward allowing players to earn points each week and purchase gear until the launch of the expansion (November 13, 2008).</div></div><hr />
