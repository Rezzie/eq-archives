<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 65 druid with RC3.  Is there a value in doing the pure blood quest??  There's always counteract disease/poison... <br />
<br />
Sure, having 1 spell is nice but usually if RC3 doesn't cure it I just ask the shaman to cure it or wait til it passes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a reasonable chunk of exp when you do the hand in for the spell; good way to get to know crypt of nadox if you havent been there before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aquila Swiftspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's really useful for LDoN, I find, when someone sets off a stupid trap, and RC doesn't handle it (but then, I only have RC 1; have you found that RC always handles it?).<br />
<br />
I also find the refresh on RC slow when a group melee gets slowed or snared in a variety of places.<br />
<br />
The quest isn't that hard, especially if you have a couple buddies who want to explore a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Pure blood is a lifesaver for some Elemental encounters. RC still has a very long reuse time, is group only and has a random factor. Counteract disease/poison are totally useless against some effects. Besides, pure blood is pretty easy to get, so it's really worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And worth it at any time.<br />
<br />
As others noted, it does not have the reuse restrictions of Radiant Cure.  I also find RC is buggy in regards to differences in Z axis.  ie, you can use it on someone and they are on a hill and it doesn't work but then it is used and you have to wait.<br />
<br />
Pureblood is a better castable remove poison and remove disease in one spell than we have in individual spells (our best remove poison and disease spells are 8 counters each.  If I read Lucy right, Pure Blood is 18 counters of both poison and disease. (9 counter of poison x 2 slots, 9 counters of disease x 2 slots).  <br />
<br />
So...you can mem just the one spell, and you can deal with slows and poisons pretty easily.<br />
<br />
I find it invaluable in VT in particular...mobs use both poisons and diseases there, and it is nice to just have the one spell up all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pureblood is irreplaceable by Radiant Cure.<br />
<br />
I find myself curing poison/disease stuff with pureblood and saving radiant cure for tash/malo/snare affects.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I took a 6+ month break and more or less missed all the news about LoY<br />
<br />
Thanks for your responses... I guess I'll drag some buds with me to go do the quest heheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kiatek2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I did this quest in 15 minutes including the time it took to restart my computer when my son hit the reset button.  There were people killing all the things that drop the quest components.  So I simply asked if I could loot, looted up, went to forage, brewed, and turned the stuff in.  <br />
<br />
good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tatankawd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well it takes more that 15 minutes if you are doing the quest now (like me) compared to when LoY came out.  I was alone in the zone last night, except for a soloing necro.  LOL he happened to get one of the drops and let me loot it, my 40+ kills produced nothing for the other two drops.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I shiver at the thought of doing this quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Oldoaktree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I did it within the week of LOY launching and some of hte pieces took me a damn long time to get...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It took a couple of hours with me, a monk (65) and an SK (63).  I was LOM the whole time though because as the SK put it... his gear is the best Kunark can offer!  (ok, it's a little better than that, but he took a long break! :P )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>FireCaller01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I spent a better part of a week badgering the clerics, shammies, and druids in my guild to get this spell before we made our first Grummus attempt. It really pays off in some PoP encounters and it also rocks the house in LDoN :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pureblood is a required spell for my guild ... Rather, it determines who gets raided in for Quarm and who gets to cheer us on during the fight.  Suffice to say, it has become a priority for our healers.<br />
<br />
Getting the quest stuff is easy except for the luggalds.  I DS tanked the pirates (and PL'd my 40 cleric at the same time).  Then root DoT'd the trolls (root/DoTing 5 at a time).  Actually, I DS/nuke tanked the luggalds which is a lot of medtime but I got lucky on drops and got one early.<br />
<br />
The trolls and luggalds are blue at 65 so gave a little bit of exp so I didn't feel like I was wasting my time.  Since I was PLing my cleric, I didn't feel like I was wasting time killing greenies either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Charm a pig in nadox (exhausted bloodtusk if you have command of tunare, otherwise one of the other pigs), it's fun!  Make sure you give it a pair of weapons too; the zraxthil forged weapons are good for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I sort of did the quest because I was bored.  But, I find I use the spell a lot, and its not a disappointment.  As many have said the reuse cast time on RC is quite long.  But this is a powerful little spell under the right circumstance.  I love it, but its not fast to get unless you are very lucky.  I think I got almost 2 AA points charms killing luggalds before I got the pure blood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>durinstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i did the quest a few days ago, and got in all done in about an hour or two.  The exhausted boar there make a great pet, and he just tore up the mobs.  took me about 10-15 kills on each type to get the pieces (might have just gotten lucky), but was having fun with the charmed pet so i was kinda sad when i was done =)<br />
<br />
also, it's a no fail combine now, so don't have to worry about your brewing (or so i hear and i combined it with a skill of 40)<br />
<br />
havn't used it take much yet, but it's nice to know it's there if RC doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oldoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">FYI, Pureblood DOES remove her poison AOE with a single cast.  I have had druids tell me only by having the clicky abolish poison arms from VT could you do it but that is not true.<br />
<br />
I love Pureblood.  It also has one of my favorite spell animations for druid spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Eridalafar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It is a must have spell. If you have LoY, you don't have any reason to don't have this spell.<br />
<br />
It can take a few time to get the needed drop items in Nadox, in 3 hours eatch item can drop between 0 and 3 times. One time all that was needed is killing 3 mobs, other never see a drop in 4 hours.<br />
