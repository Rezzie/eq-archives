This piece is awesome, but it brings me to the precipice of the uncrittable defense rate. Replacing the Heavy Clefthoof Chest with the Malorne chest (T4) reduced the amount of defense I have. I even had to waste a yellow gem slot with a Thick Dawnstone (+8 defense) in order to get me up to 410. (415 needed)<br />
<br />
So I need suggestions please on best fix.<br />
I could upgrade my Barbed Choker od Discipline with the Necklace of the Juggernaut; for an increase in 6 defense rating. (cost- 25 badges)<br />
or<br />
get the new enchant for +15 defense rating to chest<br />
(cost - exceptional stats +6 to all stats) ( I cant figure out the math, but it seems that I could switch the +8 def gem for something better like stam?)<br />
or<br />
do I just rely on Flask of Forification for every raid. (+10 defense rating)<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else have this issue?<br />
Is there a better way to go about this?<br />
(btw- I do not do arena...and I might do BG if a piece of gear merits a change---cause i'm pvp challenged)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravnia</div><div class="date">03-31-2008, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend upgrading to Necklace of the Juggernaut (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/item-info.xml?i=29386) and Waistguard of the Great Beast (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/item-info.xml?i=33583).  Having 2 gem slots from the waist should give more options ...<br />
<br />
Also did you ever get a chance of getting Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/item-info.xml?i=28528) which will do better for your mitigation than the Darkmoon Card: Vengeance.<br />
<br />
Grats on the chest piece btw ... I simply just gave up on Mags and moved on ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">opataris</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Ravnia for the help.<br />
I had to go ahead and get the defense enchant for chest. I just couldn't get the defense rate up high enough any other way except doing some pvp and getting resilience gear. Since I had a +8 defense gem in yellow slot, I went ahead and traded up to the Necklace of the Juggernaut. This allowed to me to swap in a Enduring Talasite (+4 dr and +6 stam). At first glance I lost 6 stam from Barbed Choker of Discipline and got i back with the Enduring Talasite...which didnt seem to get me much gain. However, the Necklace of the Juggernaut has +19 agility which is a nice gain. :grin: <br />
<br />
I am looking into the Waistguard of the Great Beast. I would lose some armor from the Treemenders belt, however, since I am armor capped I can afford it. The gain I could get from stam or agility would be nice.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Ravnia</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember, between your defense skill and your resilience you need 2.6% reduced chance to be critted.  :&gt;<br />
