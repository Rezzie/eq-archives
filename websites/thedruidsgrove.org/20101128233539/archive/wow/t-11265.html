<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flower</div><div class="date">11-12-2006, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got the book last night in a drop from UBRS, my first thought was to use it, but i'm mostly resto at this point and am wondering if it may be just smart to sell it before TBC.  I see that you get FB VI at lvl 63, but will you be able to learn it if you don't have FB V?  Will TBC allow you to learn FB V from a trainer?<br />

thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

HT11, Rejuv11, ferocious bite, and maybe another one I can't remember.</div></div><hr />
