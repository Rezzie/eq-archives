So I am wondering how many people are ready to move into and explore the new zones on release. <br />

My main interest is singleplayer tasks, which I know there will be a lot of. This is my first expansion as part of Tide, so that will probably mean something.. dunno what yet.</div></div><hr />

But, as with all the other expansions, I will continue with my current state of exploring the zones that others have already explored first.<br />

I am lucky to have a good friend on my server that is in the top guild. His guild is able to see new content and he then shares with me :)</div></div><hr />

Kidnap Fenier... kill him over and over and over again until we both get our spells and have seen every single zone / instance PoR has to offer! :)<br />

I am so not ready to visit the Prophecy of Ro zones but I do have an important goal for the expansion: Go to the bank and unload all the junk I am carrying with me. Right now I have to turn off foraging or I would get encumbered from simply picking up some berries...<br />

But, I'm still behind the curve on content. So, I'll be happy if I can finish up some DoN or DoD stuff. Still don't have my damn spells.</div></div><hr />

By then the guild should have spoilers on everything (since I can't trailblaze) and I should catch up quickly.  Not that they'll share, they should just have the info.<br />
 <br />
Gonna have to reorganize my mules, one for each tradeskill :)<br />
 <br />
And SoH goes down for the final count.  Damn boyscouts.<br />
 <br />
Hey Kaid, what do you do to Ranjas in your guild that ninja-buff you with SoH?<br />
