<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">02-22-2008, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm thinking of relocating to a west coast server (currently on an east coast server).  Makes sense, I'm on the west coast myself.  I didn't know when I created my first characters where the various servers were located.  I think raiding times might work out better with my schedule.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in PVE servers and ones where the Alliance is not completely hopeless in battlegrounds -- is that wishful thinking?  On my current server we're quite pathetic.<br />
<br />
Also I'll probably be looking for a Kara level guild.  I have a level 70 resto druid in blues and a level 70 rogue (mostly purples).  <br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Oh, here's a list of West Coast PVE servers if that is helpful.<br />

The downside is that on such servers you may have to queue to log in.  Those servers also tend to be quite cliquey and elitist from what I hear.<br />

<br />
Through my research it looks like Reckoning might be the one of the best battlegroups for Alliance.  Anyone have experience with Reckoning?  I'm also thinking of going for Arathor.  It is a newish server, only 1 year old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im on Aszhara in EU and this was one of the first servers since release. 70% on this server are since the beginning here and so the economy is really good. U can buy mats pretty cheap cause there is so much of them around. And leveling a profession like blacksmithing or tailoring or letherworking isnt very important cause there are so much ppl who can make the things for you(if &quot;bind on equipped&quot; that is).<br />
Another good thing on such a server is, that items for pvp-twinks are sold for a s...load of money.<br />
Once i sold a lvl 19 blue for 1200g. Money doesnt play a role cause ppl have enough on such a server^^</div></div><hr />

EG &quot;man that feral druid is imba&quot;, to say, &quot;man that feral druid is very powerful&quot;<br />

Ewwww.....<br />
<br />
Hehe.<br />
<br />
Well I know the Alliance does well in AV on Shu'Halo and they overpopulate us on the Horde Side.<br />
<br />
It's a West Coast Server too. You might be able to find something you like over here.<br />
<br />
Check out our realm forums, a couple guilds are recruiting.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you transfer here.<br />
<br />
We can have dance parties outside the Scryer Bank.</div></div><hr />

Ditto, stay safe.  The servers will be there when you get back!</div></div><hr />

I might not get the battlegroup I was aiming for, but I have had a few nibbles from guilds that raid at more ideal times.

Same from me: stay safe and see you back soon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">03-04-2008, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Late as I may be and assuming you haven't chosen yet (probably have?)... I happen to be on Aerie Peak US (short-hand AP for reference)<br />
<br />
Quick facts.<br />
<br />
We have 9 guilds in T6 (http://www.wowwiki.com/Server:Aerie_Peak_US/Level_70_raid_Progression) (though, don't let that fool you; to be honest, AP isn't that great on quality).<br />
<br />
Any BG has less than a minute queue.<br />
<br />
We win AV 50-60%.<br />
AB, WSG, and EotS are toss ups, usually not as frequent on wins. My experience with WSG is biased as I can escape the horde base with seven on me and capture the flag. So, I can't give you average results there.<br />
<br />
It is a few months shy of two years old. But, it used to be one of the most populated US realms. Transfers off have fixed that (several times, we hit queues in the 600s-900s... painful). Queues to get in are 100-200 tops on peak hours, usually not all the time.<br />
<br />
With the abundance of guilds on AP, it is should be alright finding a guild if you put effort into it. However, I don't raid, so I can't give you accuracies there. But there are a lot of raiders.<br />
<br />
90% of the guilds on AP raid at PST, to my better knowledge. I know many of them raid at times that accomodate working and school hours. I'm EST myself, so it was painful at first (raiding until 2:30 AM, but then again, I am homeschooled).<br />
<br />
As far as PvP overall, Nightfall (Aerie Peak's Battlegroup), it's okay... Not as great as the others, and Aerie Peak only has about, what, less than ten teams above 2000 arena rating in all brackets?<br />
<br />
Anyway, hoped that helped, assuming you hadn't chosen yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, to Eldrynn. As others have said, stay safe. Hope all goes well over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">03-07-2008, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a great guild on a PST server... unfortunately it is still located on the East coast, so my ping rates didn't go down.  Seems odd they'd put a server on the East Coast that uses PST time zone.  <br />
<br />
Oh well!  The guild is terrific though!  I haven't tried the BGs yet...</div></div><hr />
