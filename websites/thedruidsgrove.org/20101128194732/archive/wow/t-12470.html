 <br />
I am new to WoW and am wondering if it is worthwhile to solo instances that yield no experience in order to get better loot?  (I do not dislike grouping, but my play time is sporadic and frequently interrupted so I don't feel that I can pull my weight in groups.)<br />
 <br />
At level 43, I notice that I'm still using a couple of pieces of gear from instances I did with groups 10 levels ago.  I tried Razorfen Kraul solo for an hour and took down a couple of bosses, but found it time-consuming and, of course, did not earn any experience.<br />
 <br />
Would appreciate any thoughts on whether the best use of time in game, from a character advancement standpoint, is to quest or do solo instances.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

1.  Just because you can and you like challenges<br />
2.  You need cash.<br />
3.  You are trying to gather mats to level some profession (such as enchanting or tailoring or first aid.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
you cant use anything from the instances unless you need to make a little money like allahanastar says<br />
<br />
the loot you gain from questing will be good enough to get you to outlands and then once you are there the loots get pretty amazing<br />
<br />
i would just concertrate on enjoying being the best class there is and learning all the tricks druids have :)</div></div><hr />

Save your money too for your epic ground mount.</div></div><hr />
