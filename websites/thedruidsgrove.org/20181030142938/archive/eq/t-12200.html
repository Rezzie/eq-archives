 Dreadspire is a high end zone, but its geared for single groups and is accessible completely through single group content.  The raids people have been doing don't really play into getting into that zone.  They are required for some other things that people haven't discovered yet, though.<br />
 <br />
I'll say this...no one has gotten into the final expansion zone yet.  I expect that people will get in there before too long, but there's still a lot of content ahead for even the most high end raiders.<br />

Being a person that has done the last 3 DoDH AA raids - I'm very glad to see him ensuring us there's a lot more content in the high end.</div></div><hr />

Some dumbass spoiled it all on SoE boards already.  Great to see someone ****ing on their friend's efforts to discover the access quest just so he could sound l33t with his knowledge...  <br />
 <br />
I'm not saying DS should be my personal country club, but being in a guild which was one of the first to figure out the quest I know it's not by any means easy to figure out on your own, it took hours of work to get it down.  I just don't see why people should get to benefit off of all that work -this soon- just because they're too stupid or lazy to figure it out on their own.  He should have at least waited a month from after getting access to spill the beans imo.</div></div><hr />

I am by no means uber, as my guild is just getting ready to enter elementals, but I don't see where it matters if everyone knows how to enter the zone. If it is like most of the other high end zones, regardless of how many people CAN get in, if they aren't ready to be there, they won't last in said zones.</div></div><hr />

Dalnoth wasn't responsible for Dalnoth getting into Dreadspire was - other people were.  But than without their permission he goes and post all the information they discovered (making appear as it was his own) with his main motivation being to look cool with the knowledge he has, NOT to help people.  Now if it's cool to take your friends work and do as you wish with it that's your thing, but I definaly don't agree with that.<br />
 <br />
If you have ever grouped in DS you'll know that gimps being flagged won't effect you. Mobs hit for ~1500, namers hit for ~4k, respawn is fast as ****, mob runs fast (and selo doesn't work), and the magurity of the mobs are ethier non-KoS or KoS mobs in areas you can't train from.  <br />
 <br />
Also, IMO the epic quest is a terrible comparison.  It is emmesly more complex - and a big motivation behind people sharing info early was so they could get info for others to help themself.  Epics are also class specific and there's ones for every class - so you can't have a guild effort to single out a single epic (realisically.)</div></div><hr />

And he seems to talk a lot...<br />
 <br />
Don't get me wrong, I don't particularly like the guy either or would I agree with doing stuff like that if that's what happened... just seems like most ppl are bitching b/c he made the info they had available to everyone when they in the same way benefited from Valsuvious' whoopsie on the eqlive boards. Personaly I could care less either way really ... what he did to ppl I don't know isn't really my concern. Nor is who gets into DS or how they got the info.<br />

Was funny reading the comment from that one person who thanked him for creating another bot knowing what it's in there lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do however agree that someone posting the info and implying it was all their hard work and brains that worked it out, basically taking credit for someone elses hard work, just shows how lame that person really is, just imo of course.</div></div><hr />
