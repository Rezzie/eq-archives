Sell the silks for a couple plats each to other players in the Bazaar. Lots of higher level characters don't want to do the grunt work of gathering supplies to do tradeskills. You can capitalize on this.</div></div><hr />

Take a look around at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqtraders.com&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;EQ Traders&lt;/a&gt; and see what tradeskill components you can obtain, and then check the bazaar to see what sells the best and go get those items.</div></div><hr />

North Ro spiders are fewer in number but will be way easier to farm at 18 and on my server silks go for 8-10pp each in the baz.</div></div><hr />

Misty Thicket has spiderlings and wolves in abundance, and one Leather Padding goes for 20pp or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The regular mammoth tusks are a decent money maker but you wouldn't be able to hunt those solo quite yet I think...maybe around level 25...can't really recall.  The regular mammoth tusks sell for about 10plat to a vendor (18plat?).  been a long time though since I used to do that...things may have changed.</div></div><hr />

Just grab one, run it through the Barb village and kite it along the water's edge toward the North Karana bridge.  Was good exp in the pre-kunark age.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As others have said, tradeskill supplies and the bazaar are the ticket for leeching off the rich!  Just charge significantly less than the regular gougers and your stock will sell in minutes.<br />

Not to mention they poison.  I would say just kill where ever you get the xp.  It takes a bit, but you should be able to get enough money for your spells.  Also, if you look in to doing quests, you can get better armor.  At 18, the xp you get for doing them might actually be noticable even.</div></div><hr />

Up to you. Do you have all your spells up to your current level, or money for your next round? If not, I'd work on them. After that.. Explore new zones, embark on the beginnings of a tradeskill career, level up, get money, upgrade your gear...<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, what do you wanna do? Plenty of stuff is open to you. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the ones in Oasis at the 'orc highway' are somewhere around 15-20, so you should get some xp still.</div></div><hr />

First, sewing kits are your friend for that hunting.<br />
<br />
Second, the vendor out on the platform in Everfrost (near the second ice river) is very handy.  Fill packs...run to vendor and sell..rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
It was one time that I really used dru Str buffs, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Necridious</div><div class="date">07-21-2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they may be a bit green now, but the Willowwisps on Wisp Isle are common, and easy to find.  Kill them, Sell lightstones for 1.5 pp, keep the greater lightstones.  Take the greater lightstones to the Gypsies in N. Karana, and trade each one in for a Concordance of Research.  Sell the Concordance of Research back to her.  Depending on faction and charisma, you can get fro 7 to 11 pp each.  If I'm not mistaken, you get your first personal gates at 19, and one of them is for N. Karana, so the run will be pretty short for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also hunt the Eastern side of the Overthere, there are cockatrices, rhinos, and tigers, which I think count as animals, as well as succulents and sarnak.  Many will drop a few pp, as well as dropping various sellables that can be worth up to 3pp depending on the item (Ivory from the rhino's and such.)   I'm a wizard so I don't know exactly what is an animal though, you'll just have to try.<br />
<br />
You can also group or solo easily in the Lake of Ill Omen, around the mill and on the southern shore.  Mobs get bigger the more north and west you head, and at your level don't piss off the bloodgill goblins that are &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the lake.  Again, mobs commonly drop some gold, with a few dropping plat--more commonly the more north and west you head, untill you are fighting in the goblin caves or in the sarnak fort, which can easily net you 10+ plat an hour in a group, not bad at around level 20.  <br />
<br />
If, and this is a pretty strong if,  you have a group of friends that will come with you, you can begin fighting in some newbie dungeons.  Paludal Caverns is the modern newbish hotspot, with decent drops of sellable loot, and cash drops. The hidden side of Echo Caverns is fun, and has some respectable magic item drops from the mutants-- though to go past the first room you would probably need a good group. You can also cart off wagon loads of fine steel as rare-ish drops from upper guk (frog land), Najena (undead and ogres, tentacle terrors), Sol A (goblins, gnomes, automatons), and the area outside The Accursed Temple of Cazic Thule in the Feerott (lizardmen).  All of these places begin to be doable in full, well oiled groups around 16, and can easily take you to your 30's.  Fine Steel sells for around 4pp per weapon to a vendor.<br />
<br />
Possibly the best and easiest money dungeon is the Warrens, at the back of the Paineel newbie ground.  Lots of Oriental themed bronze weapons drop--selling for a few plat each while looking sweet equipped :) , as well as wicker armor.  In addition, collect kobold molars to turn in either in the Palace in Paineel (you'll have the faction to enter this evil place after killing in the warrens for a while) or in the Paladin Guild in Erudin.  You get good faction with the appropriate city, bad with it's opposite ( the 2 cities are the good and evil cities that erudites start in), some coin, and randomly you will get ringmail armor.  Very nice for the untwinked newbie, and decent sellable too--sells about like fine steel weapons.  Another plus to this dungeon is that kobolds commonly drop alcoholic drinks, and you can max your alcohol tolerance easily here. :)   They also drop bags, boxes pouches and some other common usefull goods too, which makes them ideal hunting for the untwinked newbie group.  This dungeon will support full groups of level 1 to about level 25 with multiple camp spots and varying and usefull loot and good xp, with xp coming on a few of the more rare mobs into your 30's.<br />
<br />
Don't know about druids, but as a young necro I was able to begin easily killing Forest Giants in groups in the Warslik Woods of Kunark, and able to solo them at 20.  They drop plat, and rare weapons which sell for 10 or better plat, Lumber Jack Caps which sell to friendly vendors for 30ish plat, and extremly rarely Forest Loops which are decent earrings for you, and can sell for 50ish in the bazaar sometimes.  When kunark first came out this was the farmable loot of choice as the earring sold for 1k!...<br />
<br />
You can &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; for Cougars in Iceclad Ocean around the gnome outpost.  They are animals, and as such are susceptible to your charms and fear.  They don't drop much cash but do rarely drop Cougar Claw earrings, which I think have Imp Damage 1, but I might have the focus effect wrong.  You can probably take these in a group, and you might be able to solo them.  My lowest character was 25 when vellious came out though, so I don't really know how you will fare here, you might need to wait a few levels.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of to try.  Oasis, Southern and Northern Ro, Butcher Block mountains, Estate of Unrest yard trash, Befallen's lower levels, Emperor Crush's room in Crushbone, Etc.. are all fine places to visit at your level, and great fun, but as you pointed out, not good money.  Try some of what I have written above and at the very least, you will have seen a goodly portion of the world.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solice Farwalker</div><div class="date">07-22-2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Take your sewing kit and go to East Karana as suggested, kill crags combine the spider webs into silk swatches.  You will have no problem selling the silk swatches for 10p each.  Do the selling at the bazaar in trader mode when you are not playing.<br />
<br />
While you are in East Karana set your forage skill to auto forage (I like to tie it to the forward arrow).  Save the tea leaves you forage - they sell for 10p each.<br />
<br />
While doing this you will get tasty exp from the crag spiders you are killing.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Go around the Barbarian village to get the Crag to the beach when kiting, not through.  The guards will kill the Crag and you lose the loot and exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Higher level players collect all kinds of stuff that they consider junk and they can replace easy but would be considered your best item if you traded with them.</div></div><hr />
