<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">02-12-2006, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking for the text given by two items:<br />
<br />
The Shattered Blade and the Anicent Werewolf Skull (all 3 levels).<br />
<br />
So far I have for the Shattered Blade:<br />
<br />
Level 1:<br />
<br />
<br />
The sword whispers something you do not understand.  It speaks will the strange inflections of a shilskin and its voice is gravely and slow, as though it has just awoken from a deep sleep<br />
<br />
Level 2:<br />
<br />
Have Faith in your strength, togehter we will rule Darkhollow again!<br />
<br />
Personally I like the text emotes and am trying to level my sword (its freaking slow going tho) and I would like to know what I have to look forward to.<br />
<br />
For the Skull I get at random during level 1 an emote about a wolf hollowing in the distance when something dies.<br />
