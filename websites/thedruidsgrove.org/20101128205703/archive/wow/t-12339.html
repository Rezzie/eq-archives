<br />
Been speaking with my flatmate Annikk about this but would love to hear some other opinions on the matter. <br />
<br />
I've just dinged 70 and have just completed my karazhan attunment which meant heading into level 70 instances. Running through arcatraz in particullar i was in a group with two shadowpriests which to be fair is a tanks worst nightmare for agro control. Anyway i noticed my tps was kinda low generally throughout the instance it sat at about 500 tps average. I was holding agro just about but there were a few times where i would have to chase after mobs which the priests had agro'd. What i'm wondering is what rotation i should use to achieve the best tps output. <br />
<br />
What i have been trying is keeping lacerate at 5 stacks ALL the time and refreshing mangle then filling in the blanks with maul. Occasionally i would shoot up to about 800-900 tps. I suppose thats just gear though as i'm a new 70 my gear is rather nab :(<br />
<br />
Annikk suggested; starfire &gt; moonfire &gt; (feral) faerie fire &gt; mangle &gt; lacerate. <br />
<br />
Anyways just want to hear any other suggestions :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ellyen</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The change I recently made was with the use of Maul.  Maul does not trigger the global cool-down and will activate (be expended) on the next normal hit. Previously I tended to use it only as part of the pull, now it gets used much more frequently.<br />
<br />
What I do now (in infinite rage situations such as bosses) is use Maul as soon as it has been expended.  Use Mangle whenever it's available and lacerate whenever the GCD allows.  The maul will quite happily sit there waiting to be used and will not be affected by the Mangles or Lacerates.<br />
<br />
I would estimate that it increased my threat by 10%-20%.  The only actual figures that I can quote are from the damage I was doing.  Previously 50%-55% of my damage was 'normal hits' not that has dropped to 25% with Maul being 35%.<br />
<br />
For non-boss mobs I can't do this so much as I tend to run out of rage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Igren</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah i'm fairly new to tanking so i'm not 100% rage efficient yet not even very good at keeping rotations i seem to have made it this far just mashing buttons :P I did notice maul wasn't on the same cooldown which is just swell! Cheers for the input much appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maul is a rage-nerfer, to be sure.<br />
<br />
The problem arises because a lot of the rage a bear generates comes from their white damage.  When using maul, the white damage attacks become yellow damage maul attacks.  And when the maul hits, you don't gain rage in the same way that you do when you hit a mob with white damage.<br />
Instead you even lose some rage - Maul costs rage too.<br />
<br />
So it's best to only use maul if you have plenty of rage.  If rage is not abundant, lacerate and mangle are your best bet.<br />

Like heroic strike for Warriors, Maul is our rage dump and should only be used when you have plenty :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only Maul if I have well over 50 rage.  As soon as it drops below 50, I stop Maul'n.  Even in times of excessive rage, using Maul every time it is available can suck the rage out of you.  So, use Maul as needed, but keep an eye on the rage bar so you know when to stop.<br />
<br />
I guess this plays into the &quot;too much mitigation&quot; discussion.  At some point, you could have too much mitigation such that your rage generation drops and resulting in a loss of TPS (can't use maul) and dead healers/DPS'rs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">01-22-2008, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lacerate is very much like a sunder.  The more you have on there, the more agro you generate.  There is a base amount of threat it generates based on how many stacks it has.  So its always to your benefit to stack Lacerate as high as you can go.  If you are rage starved Lacerate is your best.  If you are tanking a boss style mob where rage isn't an issue, you are best to lacerate often and weave in Mauls as well.  Mangle is a key ability too.  So you need to hit mangle ever time its up.</div></div><hr />

Once again Mangle is probably the best threat generator out of all our available spells so .... yea .... best be spamming whatever poor button you assigned it to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yet i still have T1 nd T2 in bags and banks.<br />
<br />
lol in fact most of my T2 has to be used if i ever need to heal in BC due to not having upgraded it really.<br />
<br />
its funny when people look at it and say wow nice gear or wow that's funny looking stuff etc and then i tell em where it came from.<br />
<br />
its most funny when people see some of my stuff like T2 etc and when i say its from BWL they say - where is that ? ;)<br />
<br />
but at least at Neffy us ferals got to tank the dragons and then the skeleton things when they came back to life towards the end of the fight</div></div><hr />

<br />
all these people who dont appear to have done old 5 mans like scholo / dm etc let alone done a 40 man raid or killed Ony.<br />
<br />
but it will happen again in 6 months or so with other people only joining after WotLK and going straight past some of the now instances on their way to 80 as quick as possible.<br />
<br />
its progress......<br />

<br />
moved on and dont have anything like the time or commitment for 40 mans.<br />
<br />
they were fun but the organising and running and the size of the guild needed seemed a little hard to acheive with a variety of people.<br />
<br />
i'm sure if you get a total bunch of no lifer's together it worked - but then it became a job not a game for fun !</div></div><hr />
