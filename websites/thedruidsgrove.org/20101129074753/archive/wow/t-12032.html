<br />
While working hard on my leveling, I know I should also be leveling my Reputation with different factions.<br />
<br />
Which ones do you recommend I focus on, and how do I do this the most effectively?<br />
<br />
I know there are certain pre-requisites required in order to be able to run Kara, for example.  Where do I find this information?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">09-17-2007, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can start the Kara key requirement prior to 70 so you're good to go.  <br />
<br />
- Go to Karazhan<br />
- Just outside you'll find a guy with 2 quests, do them.<br />
- That leads to a chain where you need to run Shadow Lab<br />
- Then run Steamvaults &amp; Arcatraz ( you don't have to run the all, just to the key container.  In SV it is just before the first boss, and in Arc it is just after in the room with all the void walker guys and it can be stealthed to by a group of druids &amp; rogues )<br />
- Run Black Morass<br />
- You are now keyed for Kara<br />
<br />
As for other rep:<br />
- Cenarion Expedition ( Exalted ) will get you access to the Earthwarden, which is the best tanking weapon unless you are in a guild running Serpentshrine Caverns.<br />
- The Sha'tar ( Exalted ) for a really nice healing mace ( if you go resto )<br />
<br />
You need Revered to run heroic difficulty instances ( Lower City, Cenarion Expedition, The Sha'tar, Keepers of Time, Honor Hold....I might be missing one &gt;.&lt; )<br />
<br />
Cenarion Expedition has turn-ins to help with rep progress, the rest of them you have to run a specific instance over and over to hit your rep requirement: Black Morass, Steamvaults, Arcatraz, Shadow Lab, and Shattered Halls.<br />
<br />
That's about all I can think of at the moment.  Hope this gets you off on the right foot for your rep runs.<br />
<br />
Here's also a wonderful online reputation calculator that shows you how many runs you have to do of what instance(s) to get to your next rep level:  http://www.wowreputationcalculator.com/</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now find myself grinding for Lower City Rep at level 70, and about to ding &quot;honored&quot;, meaning i STILL have to grind another 12000 rep to hit &quot;Revered&quot; before i can complete my epic flight form quest.</div></div><hr />

Get those shards while you're at it!<br />

Besides access to the heroic HP instances which I believe are not &quot;needed&quot; for anything particularly &quot;Druid&quot; in nature, correct?<br />
<br />
IOW, do I need to carefully manage how I earn my HH/Thrallmar rep like I need to for CE and Lower City?</div></div><hr />
