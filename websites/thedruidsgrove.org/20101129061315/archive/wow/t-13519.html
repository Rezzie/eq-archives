I am a new druid Teddie is 23 and more fun than my 80 hunter. I love to pvp and have discovered that a druid can realy make life rough on the opposinfg faction. While in Warsong gulch bear form seems to intimidate all but a Palidin. I am intristed in any help or sudgestions on basic hit rotation for a low lvl. I am hoping to realy make life misrible for the &quot;other guys&quot;. Any sudgestiond will be greatfully accepted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I run flags i usually charge someone down the field and bash then run off.  Pop nature's grasp if you have that yet if people are chasing you.  <br />

WSG as a druid is the best thing ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By 26 your caster form can remove curses and poisons, enough to anger the other side.  I think your caster form would also have warstomp, which would also make the opposing team unhappy.  However, I rarely see that actually used in the PvP that I do.<br />

I run cat, so most of my advise wouldn't apply to a bear.</div></div><hr />
