<br />
My Feral druid is lvl 67 at the moment, and is doing well and can take down mobs very quick at times - however, I seem to have a problem with Ferocious Bite missing far more than any other attack.<br />
<br />
I have seen me put three hits (usually mangle) on a mob to have 5 combo points, and then try to finish off with FB - miss, miss, miss three times in a row, each miss using about 20 energy or so. <br />
<br />
I do not really have any +hit rating (about 30), but I am seeing this happen with mobs below me by about 1 or 2 levels, so didn't think +hit would matter in that case anyway.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts please? or is this to be expected now and again?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't FB be blocked/parried whereas Mangle and Rip cannot?  Or something like that.</div></div><hr />

Got up to 135 +Hit Rating.<br />

Haven't had that problem since.</div></div><hr />

Basically, for normal attacks, we barely notice the misses. But when we're ready to unload the 5 point, 100 energy big bites on that Alliance player running away, the &quot;Miss&quot; is painful. We pay attention, we notice it.<br />
<br />
I think you'll find, statistically, that ferocious bite misses just as often as anything else. no more or less.</div></div><hr />

qft. I always look for big numbers whenever I unload a FB =)<br />

@lewisteh - It's still possible to miss on mobs a few levels below yours iirc. Hit rating will however help your overall DPS and make more of your finishers likely to hit. +hit always offers a big boost to your DPS (until hit cap). The 3 misses in a row are just random chance.</div></div><hr />

While questing last night with 60+ hit rating, I missed more than can remember.  I don't have my damage shown (seems sort of pointless) in the SCT, but you can &quot;hear&quot; misses/blocks/parries.  The damn wolves I had to take out for their pelts last night were giving me all kinds of fits.  And I was typically 1-3 levels above them plus I have 60+ HR.<br />
<br />
It was crazy.  It just has to be your fault. :biggrin:</div></div><hr />

Blizzard's random number generator is obviously out to get you. It happens to some of us. All you can do is stack hit rating and later on stack expertise.</div></div><hr />

Hey cool tlbj - my miss rate disappeared last night and I was 2 shotting things now and again in the 60-69 lvl BG's.<br />
