<br />
It is an AoE effect dot on a 5? minute timer.<br />
<br />
First tier (level 5) did 4 dmg for 4 rounds.<br />
<br />
2nd tier (level 10) did 8 dmg for 4 rounds.<br />
<br />
3rd tier (level 15) does 8-22 damage initially and then 11 damage for 4 rounds.<br />
<br />
It can be resisted. Each mob does it own resistance check so you can have it land on one mob but resisted by another.<br />
<br />
I'm not 100 percent sure about the number of rounds, maybe others can confirm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there was a post in the forums on Allakhazam by : Netos<br />
<br />
#1 - Hollows Widow: Spawns in the Hollow - cross the river to where the bears and pumas are and kill everything you see until she pops. She's about level 5-6. <br />
 <br />
#2 - Charbones: Spawns on the 3rd level. Second cubbie on the left. Same room as the dusty skeletions and reanimated corpses. He spawns in the middle of the room on the slightly raised platform. Level 10-13. Easy to kill, but be careful the other skeletons will sometimes add. (Note: The dusty bone needed for another quest is a ground spawn in this room on the left wall. I'm adding that because everytime I went in this room people were killing skeletons for the bone). <br />
 <br />
#3 - Bloodmaw: Spawns in the second cave (counting caves from the north). You have to swim to get to this cave. If you see skellies you went to far! He's all the way in the cave - level 15-16 with a fast respawn rate. <br />
 <br />
#4 - Plaguebringer:   Spawns in Blighfire Moors not far from Crescent Reach.  I found him to the left as I zoned in along the wall.  Level 21-22. <br />
 <br />
#5 - Dragoneater:  Spawns in Blightfire Moors. Level 26-27. He's a Sporali Mushroom - found him north of the outpost camp next to the dead dragon. <br />
 <br />
#6 - Duskfall:  Spawns in Blightfire Moors. Level 31-32. You'll find him in the woods with the Ghost Wolfs about 20 paces south of the Denlord. I was level 30 when I killed him. Tough fight compared to the others. Flurries with a max hit of 210. Bring a friend even if you're twinked. <br />
 <br />
#7 - Enchanted Shubbery:  Spawns in Stone Hive. Approximately level 36. Spawns on the right side of the hive itself down by the water. I had to kill several a enchanted shrubs before it popped. Easy fight but watch out for the mad adds in this zone. <br />
 <br />
#8 - Poisonmaker Maliza:  Spawns in Stone Hive. Level 42-44. This one was hard to get to. Get invis and go into the actual hive and around the bend until you see the purple stairs. Take the stairs up and hang a right to the elevator. Take the elevator up and you should be in the room with all the alchemists. Make sure you are still invised and you can run through the room to the back where there is a small hallway and room enough to create a safe camp in there. Pull mobs until you get the Named to spawn. Adds are crazy in this zone and it's no different in this room. Bring a friend or two for help. <br />
 <br />
#9 - Refugiu:   Spawns in Goru'kar Mesa.       <br />
 <br />
that is as far as any one has got or at least as far as they have posted.<br />
I am just to the #5 or should say I hope to work on the #5 part tonight after work.  <br />
