One as DPS, the 2nd as a healer (along with another lvl 60 Druid healing).  It was the first time I had done any sort of healing.  We lived, but I'd really like to know what I should be doing.  So.....<br />
<br />
As a Feral Druid with an appropriate healing kit, what techniques do you use when you have to be the primary healer in a 5-man non-heroic instance?  What spells?  What ranks?  What rotations/methods do you use?  What should we avoid?  What stats should Feral healer look for on their healing gear (assume this (1/46/14) (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0zZxGGsfroezioVxcz) talent build)?  Are there any potions/food worth keeping around for healing?</div></div><hr />

I also go for a lot of intellect and mp5.  I don't get much spirit because it's less useful without the resto talents that buff it, and without tree form.<br />
<br />
I usually try to do all my healing with lifebloom.  If we're fighting a large mob or boss, I try to keep 3 stacks of lifebloom on the tank, refreshing it each time it's about to run out.<br />
<br />
I use rejuvenation when some extra healing is required, and healing touch only if I've fallen way behind.<br />
<br />
I try to only use regrowth in absolute emergencies (it has a shorter cast time).  Regrowth is the worst mana efficiency of any healing spell we get, so avoiding it wherever possible is best, imho.<br />
<br />
If things are going really badly, I whap barkskin on and hit tranquility and hope that my dudes can get the situation under control within 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
I also occasionally contribute to CC with feral charge, bash, cyclone, and hibernate.<br />
Some instances have wolfs or other beasts that can detect stealth; I sometimes use Soothe Beast to allow rogues to get close enough for a sap.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for downranking, I keep 3 different ranks of Healing Touch on my UI, but I always use the top rank of all my other spells.<br />
One rank of HT is the top one.  The 2nd is a mid-way heal that usually heals for about 2.8k.  The 3rd is a very small heal which usually hits for about 1k.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best consumables for feral druids to heal with are pretty much the same as for most healing class; Elixir of Healing Power, Elixir of Draenic Wisdom (or Major Troll's Blood), and Golden Fishsticks.<br />

I don't have lifebloom yet.  So, even as a Feral Healer it worth using the 3-stacks trick like the tree-folk do?<br />
<br />
I completely forgot about Tranquility.  My bars are organized for solo play, so I'm not sure I even have it out of the spell book.<br />
<br />
I need to sit down and do a major bar re-org for both caster and bear forms.  I think I have Kitty dead-on (not too difficult) as I now have all of the Kitty skills.</div></div><hr />

EVIL!!! Tranquility is NOT, I repeat, NOT tranquil.  It brings massive aggro and massive pain.  As in, bring lube and just lay down.<br />
<br />
Great though if you're OT and the MT dies. :wiggle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">12-13-2007, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">heh, yea thinking about it &quot;Tranquility&quot; isn't really a good description of what ensues if you use it.. :&gt;  But on a boss fight when the tank has loads of aggro anyway it can be a real life-saver, and even on trash it's better to keep everyone alive for an extra 8 seconds than let everyone die in the next 3.<br />
<br />
I still love tranquility.  It's got so much save-the-day potential.. :&gt;<br />
<br />
And yes, 3 stacks of lifebloom is a good and efficient method of healing a tank, regardless of your spec.<br />

There is a talent that reduces the threat generation by 50% and then 100%.  For resto druids its a godsend, however for any other druid you're right, you might as well bend over... cause they are gonna eat you next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Also if you're tanking and you've lost aggro and everyone is taking damage and the situation is hemorrhaging, tranquility provides the ideal tool to a) keep your dudes alive and b) get aggro back on all the mobs.<br />
