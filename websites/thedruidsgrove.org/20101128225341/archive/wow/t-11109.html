I am not sure I understand the restriction on healing touch spells but I guess there is a reasoning for it and the talent will certainly have a niche raider spec'ing to it. I see no reason to dive that deep into the resto tree to get it given that you could dive into the balance tree for much greater benefits or even feral.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard has seen how powerful using a ton of +heal gear along with low ranks of Healing Touch has become, and this it their way of trying to force druids away from using that. With HoTs stacking, I'm sure HoTs will be used a lot more, especially on main/off tanks, but I doubt druids role when healing will change much.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lANTI</div><div class="date">10-13-2006, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Guys<br />
<br />
I just came on to post about the same thing. I like how the trees have been revamped, in this form they make alot more sense, and we have been long overdue for a healing form. As a Druid who loves to heal there is one area where I have always felt naked and that is when I have pulled agro. It has never made sense to me that while healing a party if I draw agro I have to drop into bear form to increase my armor or cat form to use cower, it just dosn't fit into the feel of a healer.<br />
<br />
As a priest I have fade and shield or Pallies have more armor but can still heal in it and also have a form of shield and stun. Druid have to stop healing and shape shift into a feral form or run for it lol.<br />
<br />
I love the idea of a healing form, it makes sense, but it would need some changes before I would spec to it. The form does have some bonuses, a healing aura that effects the whole party within range, and the mana reduction for HOTs and Swiftmend by 20%.<br />
<br />
The first downside that I see is that you can only cast HOTs, I would assume that Regrowth is included in this and we get a 20% mana reduction cost on these spells. But it is costing us 872 mana to get into this form, there goes alot of saveings, and to cast anything else I have to change in and out of it. <br />
<br />
I guess the idea is that we would have maxed out Natural Shapeshifting but I am still seeing huge mana losses. In tree of Life form I would need to change forms to decurse, also if I drew agro I would need to double shapeshift to drop into a feral form as I have not armor increases or agro dropping ability, the mind boggles. <br />
<br />
Also with the speed reduction the form would be very hard to be effective in. The beauty of swiftmeld was that I could move around a fight and 'heal on the run' To take my movement speed away is crazy. I can not see any reason, in its present form why I would want to stay in Tree of Life form other than to look good.<br />
<br />
As Annubrim has said a few simple changes would make the form viable, though I would like to see decursing allowed<br />
<br />
1. Address the speed reduction<br />
<br />
2. The same armor increases as Moonkin and Bear form<br />
<br />
3 The abitlity to decurse<br />
<br />
With the mana reduction of Regrowth I could handle losing Healing touch etc, but I would see these 3 requirements as necessary to make the form a viable 41 point tallent</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, would give some cc to help deal with aggro, as long as no one touches the mob (other than the tank) the roots should hold for a while to allow you to keep casting.  6 seconds from cyclone won't cut it.<br />
<br />
Plus roots from a tree would just be fricking cool.</div></div><hr />

I think this is a great idea.. what is the point in spending all ur talent points in healing and u cant cast them all... I dont know about the ability to move thou... i tihnk that would be pretty hard.. and also pretty funny seeing a tree walk around.. but i like the idea they got about the tree form thou..<br />
<br />
What i would add is this<br />
<br />
1) give a plus Armor for this form like pallys have..<br />
<br />
2) give a VERY!!! long healing range so u dont have to move that much..<br />
<br />
3) as above i would also give AoE Roots becuase... well ur a tree...<br />
<br />
4) and no mana cost for switching forms... mostly becuase u have to always be able to walk to places.. and that would be the only form that cant..<br />
<br />
5) give the Tree Form a buff that makes the healing spells cost 50% less...<br />
<br />
That is all i need for it.. if they would change that.. well i would only play druid and they would be the best healer in the game.. somewhat.... that is alll<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">10-19-2006, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Editing my previous post here and adds some :)<br />
<br />
1. AoE roots.<br />
This could be done in several ways imo, either;<br />
a. with a cast, every mob in the area get rooted, like frost nova for mages. Would benifit the druid in solo and raid situations, keeping mobs at safe range.<br />
b. a aura that gives all in party (or raid) within xx feet area a natures grasp buff. Would give the raid a very useful extra cc ability, mainly for casters/healers.<br />
<br />
*even tho I feel that if a tree can travel indoors (how strange is that?)the druid should be able to root indoors, I dont think that blizz ever will implement this as the root/cc issue indoors have been debated for so long and Blizz wont give in on this one. Maybe the tree will make them reconsider tho*<br />
<br />
2. Armor(-or rather survivability)<br />
<br />
This could be adressed in several ways imo.<br />
<br />
a. the 360, common way to make the druid happy, armor x 3.6.<br />
This gives the druid the needed survivability to endure most in pve and pve situtions.<br />
<br />
b. Aura(*sigh* again) that make the tree of life give all in party XX HP /tick of the XX % HP that the tree have. A healthy  tree gives a healthy return. This would/could make the tree the key factor to keep the raid up on their feet as long as the tree is fit n healthy.<br />
*this is just a example*  The tree of life have 10000 HP (considered lvl 70) and give 1 % of HP/tick in aura thats 100 HP/tick, when the trees HP drops to 3000 HP the return for the party/raid is only 30 HP /tick.<br />
<br />
c. give the tree a healthy amount of resistances(with soon almost 3 billion ppl driving to work every morning spewing out pollution the trees really have to have some amount of resistance ;) )<br />
<br />
2.b would adress the pve content only and wouldnt give much in return for the druid in pvp situations. But fact remains, have Blizzard ever given resto druids anything for pvp?<br />
<br />
3. Remove poison/curse<br />
<br />
All cleasning should be reacheble in this form, shifting out to remove this is just plain silly. Without this ability a Tree of life would be nothing more then a Log of death.<br />
Keep in mind tho that decursive addons mechanics will be removed as of 2.0, that will likely change the whole perspective on instance decursing.<br />
<br />
In general, the speed reduction and the lack of HT can be compensated in diffrent ways, Im not so sure that they will be as vital as they are now. But as the 41 p talent in the resto tree looks now its not being compensated, and trees should move as normal and being able to cast HT. 41 points there doesnt look as its worth it.<br />

<br />
1.) Roots:<br />
I disagree with the AoE roots because, to make it balanced, it probably should create threat.  And threat for healers is bad...maybe instanct cast roots WHILE making roots indoors now?<br />
<br />
2.) Protection:<br />
I think it just needs the classy 360% more armor.  IMHO the resistance to all spells is bad because trees burn (fire resist), their branches can break after an ice storm (frost resist), they do die to basically the same thing as all animals (shadow resist), they are prime targets for lightning (natural resist-ref. shaman) and...I dunno about arcane.<br />

Seriously. You'd swear it would be:<br />
<br />

<br />
Healing Aura<br />
Ability to cast all healing spells (+innervate)<br />
Constant Barkskin<br />
MAYBE: Ability to cast roots (I sort of get the feeling barkskin would undermine this)<br />
<br />
Now, to make this balanced:<br />
-30% reduced movement (I think we all wouldn't mind tacking on another 10% for those benefits?)<br />
<br />
Maybe:<br />
-Reduced life<br />
-Reduced armor<br />
-Decreased healing range (if so, maybe make the speed -25%)<br />
<br />
I'm not too sure myself, but I think tree form should be the restoration's equivalent of a moonkin. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

I'm actually really torn here.  I have grown VERY fond of Resto, as have my guildies who get heals from me :P.  I guess I'll see how everything shakes out with BC.  Not sure how focused as a guild we are going to stay on raiding and trying new dungeons, or if were all gonna go quest hard until 70, or what.  If we decide to level primarily through instancing / raiding, I'm gonna do something like my feral / resto build that I have currently (0/15/36).  553 a tick on rejuv O.O.  wow.<br />

Remember also that we will have three HoT spells that can be used. I really should be able to decurse though.<br />
<br />
It don't think it was intended as a PvP tool, but I know that there are a lot of resto druids that do battlegrounds and heal, so I guess they will have to do a more hybrid role in BC (like a real druids ;)<br />
<br />
It's still better than the priests lolwell!</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I've heard, AoE Curses / Poisons will play less of a role in BC, with AoE Damage / DoT's being more prevalent.  <br />
<br />
This was stated in response to a lot of loud complaints about Decursive not working with BC.  Devs said that currently, it had gotten to the point where they had to design instances with Decursive in mind, so they threw in TONS of aoe curses / poisons / debuffs, and certain classes were being reduced to 'cleanse-bots'.  <br />
<br />
So I'm not too worried about not being able to decurse / abolish poison in tree form, though it shure would be nice.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is... thank god it's a slow 2hander, because it would be overpowered if it's a fast weapon. Ha, but luckily, we are the only class that can put a use to the proc. ;) It procs so often in catform, it's unbelievable. I can see it as a very useful weapon (proc) when fighting casters, with a Crusader enchant, no less. ;)<br />
<br />
SOO jazzed about weapon proc in forms.  The TuF is looking more and more dominant.  And I'm gonna reconsider the enchants that I was thinking about.  Really glad to hear that is not just hearsay... now to pray that they dont take it back.[/QUOTE]</div></div><hr />
