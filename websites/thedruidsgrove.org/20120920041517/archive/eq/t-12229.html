I played last night just for a short while, so I headed to PoS to slaughter some froggies for half an hour with my verteran bonus XP AA.  While I'm killing the froggies, I see a smaller than normal bear walking through the area.  I click on it, and it's the grezlan cub!  I've spent many hours in PoS, and I've never even seen it on track before.  So anyway, I decide to leave it alone while I'm charm killing frogs, since it's quicker.  As I'm finishing off the last two frogs of the night, the cub wanders by... and agroes me!!!??!  Have no idea why, the bigger bears have never agroed me.  So anyway, I DCed it and used it to finish off the last two frogs of the night.  So is this mob always agro, even if the bigger bears aren't?<br />
