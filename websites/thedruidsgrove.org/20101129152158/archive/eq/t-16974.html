As the old Illinois motto goes, vote and vote often...<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder how much of a change our elect President will be.  As they say, the more things change, the more they remain the same...<br />

[quote]WASHINGTON &#8212; When Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney in Chicago, announced the arrest of the Illinois governor, Rod R. Blagojevich, Mr. Fitzgerald said he had acted to halt a political crime spree that included what he called an &#8220;appalling&#8221; effort to sell off the Senate seat vacated by President-elect Barack Obama.<br />
<br />
But now some lawyers are beginning to suggest that the juiciest part of the case against Mr. Blagojevich, the part involving the Senate seat, may be less than airtight. There is no evidence, at least none that has been disclosed, that the governor actually received anything of value &#8212; and the Senate appointment has yet to be made.<br />
<br />
Ever since the country&#8217;s founding, prosecutors, defense lawyers and juries have been trying to define the difference between criminality and political deal-making. They have never established a clear-cut line between the offensive and the illegal, and the hours of wiretapped conversations involving Mr. Blagojevich, filled with crass, profane talk about benefiting from the Senate vacancy, may fall into a legal gray area.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Is Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich about to be impeached on grounds of loopiness, obnoxiousness and a bad haircut? Apparently so. In defense of the Illinois state senators who seem to have already decided the governor's fate, however, the haircut really does border on the criminal.</div></div><hr />
