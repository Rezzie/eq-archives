Quickened Call of the Wild is remaining as is.  The timer reduction and AA cost is not changing, you are just able to purchase the AA a few levels earlier.<br />
<br />
I expect this to go live with next data patch.<br />

Let's say I decided to come back, and I had certain aa's that I hear were bumped up to 70, as opposed to level 65 to max out the aa's when they were first available, would that mean I would essentially not have those aa's or be unable to use those aa's even though I trained them before some aa revamp?</div></div><hr />

There were no aa's that were given a higher required level. Unless I am mistaken, but I don't think I am! :wiggle:</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you said which aa's you are talking about it would be easier...but i can't remember a single time where there was a lvl 65 aa that was changed to 70.<br />
<br />
its more likely extra ranks were added, and the new ranks of the same aa line were req 70. Thats happend serveral times. You should be at the same level of ability you was before in either case.</div></div><hr />

It did not occur to me about the hastened call of the wild. I was thinking call of the wild, which is I remembered the ranks were 61/63/65, or something close to that for required levels. I misinterpretted as changing Call of the Wild to level 70, which well, if I came back and played my druid who was level 66 the day omens released, then, relegated to bazaar mule status, in favor of a ranger. So, it would have irritated me, if I came back to find I could no longer use that ability.</div></div><hr />
