However, as a frequent haunt of Thurg for those darn tufts of dire wolf fur, I have noticed and started to becone annoyed with the number of GM's and Guides that seem to have nothing better to do than to come and see if I'm AFK foraging, which I am not. It has gotten to the point that everyday withing 15 minutes of me being in the zone that I get some Guide or GM standing there messaging me. I used to have my screen off and just hit my /doability 1 /pause 5 /autoinventory hotkey and not even bother looking at my screen. Now, I'm almost paraniod to the even go get a drink of water w/o the fear of being banned. I am on the Xegony server. Anyone else in the druid community seeing this happen?</div></div><hr />

They actually come by and see if you're afk?  I understand the need to curtail the use of macros and such, but since when is it against the rules to not respond to tells or forage while not really paying attention to anything going on around you?  I often do the same with foraging, hit a button that forages 3 times, then go do some dishes, clean up around the house, read, or surf the web, etc . . . then come back, hit the button and repeat.  Now you're gonna make me paranoid lol.</div></div><hr />

When I did it to make bags (which i need to start doing again after christmas) Thurg was full of nothing but druids or rangers foraging.</div></div><hr />

We just assumed they were all pulled to eq2 or something.</div></div><hr />

They must have a lot more of free time that before.<br />

One of my guildmates greets both the guild and the GM's when he logs on now because of their tells to him in Thurgadin.  :p</div></div><hr />

/movelog to the notoriously low populated Zebuxoruk, we don't even know what a GM is here.<br />
 <br />
Autoforage happens here, and I never even heard of someone getting questioned for it.</div></div><hr />
