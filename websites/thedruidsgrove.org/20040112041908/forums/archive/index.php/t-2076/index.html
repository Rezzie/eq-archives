<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some help with data on which is better....IH4 or FT2.<br />
<br />
I lean towards FT2 because it affects all spells in the end whereas IH4 helps one spell (NI).  I'm pretty versatile, I don't really play a single role in raids or groups.<br />
<br />
Feedback (or link if this has been discussed)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ceylonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IH4 will add hp to every NI you throw. In most raid clearing sessions the ammount of hp extra from IH will outstrip the value of ft2. Personally im playing a gear swapping game on my boots still while waitng on a bid that will cap my ft.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IH4 is worth more to me than ft. Anything that makes our heals better is pretty valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tham Treehugger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Deppends on what you do most.<br />
Solo? FT2.<br />
<br />
With basicly anything else (group/raid) IH4 is better.<br />
<br />
Also, if you're at your FT cap it's a nobrainer, but I doubt you are ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm about four shy of cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Stormfront</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are only 4 shy of the cap, then I'd suggest Imp Heal4 all the way.  Then again, I'm a healing superfreak...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What slot are you considering for IH4/FT2?<br />
<br />
There are several slots where we can get IH4 relatively easily.  Gleamscale cape (back slot, tradeable, has been in the bazaar for around 25k) is the easiest one that comes to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I currently wear the Polished Smoothmetal Torque (IH4) but that Cap of Drowned Souls looks pretty yummy (beyond the FT2).<br />
<br />
I had a recent upgrade which brngs my FT pretty much to cap.<br />
<br />
I'm glad you brought up the back slot IH4.  When I was thinking of swapping out IH4 I figured until I got around to some ornate sleeve farming I'd stick to the hat. But the Gleamscale cape is a not too bad option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Really now, if you're four below the FT cap and you still don't have IH4, I think you're doing your druid a disservice.<br />
<br />
IH4 not only saves mana for you (in terms of healed HP-to-mana ratio) but just as importantly (or more important depending on who you talk to) it gives additional HP to the person you are healing.  This additional HP goes a long way in helping clerics in raids where mobs have generally high dps.  And even in xp groups, the added HP gives the tanks (and you) additional breathing room for extra damage.<br />
<br />
Finally, even if you were a nuking druid, the fact that you're at FT11 means that its about time you give your healing self a boost.<br />
<br />
Other than the above, you seem to be playing your druid very very well.  <br />
<br />
Incidentally, I'm a healing druid and i've got the gleamscale cape a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gael Stormracer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Correct me if I'm wrong, but as I understand it Improved Healing does NOT help our 75% heals? so that as the original poster says, it's 'only' +20% on Nature's Infusion (yes, 2100 rather than 1750 is nice, but these days most of the Healing I do is with Tunare's Renewal - NI is only used as a quick splash heal).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I find myself using NI much more than TR these days (and I almost never use KR).  Too much happens during the 10 second cast time these days during a fight, unless I'm the primary healer in a mindless exp group, in which case I don't really need any more efficiency.  I mostly use TR to top people off between fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Really now, if you're four below the FT cap &lt;strong&gt;and you still don't have IH4&lt;/strong&gt;, I think you're doing your druid a disservice.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, I've had it for a couple months (As mentioned in post above).<br />
<br />
I'm sort of in same spot as Palarran. I rarely use Cheal unless I am the main healer of a group.  I'm usually backing up others, one way of doing this is splash heals.  That is why my IH4 item is pretty important and makes me leery of dumping it altogether.  Hence the question.<br />
<br />
Thanks all for feedback.  I'm looking into furhter options of IH4.  :)</div></div><hr />
