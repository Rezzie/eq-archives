Who has offered to help equip me. I bought the Titanium pack so have the all expansions not just up to Velious J<br />
 <br />
What do you suggest I look for? I am interested in items whose cost won’t “exploit” friendship and or things I can hunt/camp to reduce costs.<br />
&lt;O:p<br />
Once outfitted, I plan to hunt / exp to work on upgrading this initial gear. Thanks all for the great suggestions I know will be coming. )<br />

Hunting in East Wastes - kiting the Man-O-Wars should be pretty good experience. Once you get to 50 - kiting the Undead in Umbral Plains (I think its Umbral Plains - hehehe cant remember the name of the zone right now) would be good to get some Elysian gear.<br />
 <br />
<br />
I agree with Eiram about getting items that increase your wis/HP/Mana. Here are a couple of suggestions that either do not have a level requirement or will last for a bit, items with an * are first choice:<br />
<br />
Ear: Protection of Cabbage Quest for earrings: Earring of the Solstice and Xanthe's Earring of Nature - the items for this quest are usually sold in the bazaar and sometimes as the full set of items needed<br />
<br />
Ring: Coral Ring*<br />
Diamond Wedding Band*<br />
<br />
Hands: Grey Flesh Gloves*<br />
Cunning Gauntlets of the Kin<br />
<br />
Feet: Golden Efreeti Boots*<br />
<br />
Neck: Black Alloy Medallion *<br />
<br />
Head: Othmir Fur Cap*<br />
Nightshade Wreath<br />
Savant's Cap<br />
<br />
Legs: Stormreaper's Boned Leggins * (this is class/diety specific to Halfling druids - there is a whole line of this armor)<br />
Brown Chitin Leggings<br />
Bloodweave Pantaloons<br />
<br />
Waist: Bone-clasped Girdle*<br />
Runic Belt of Foresight<br />
Girdle of Rapidity<br />
Girdle of Mithaniel<br />
<br />
Again, there is a whole line of halfling karana druid armor - not all of it is worth getting - but the legs and tunic might be something to look at.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

 <br />
Definately gives me a good starting point!<br />
 <br />
Once SOE get off its .. er rear end and moves Tedry ( they said 2 working days on Friday so hopefuly tonight). <br />
 <br />
I will get Gobb to show me how to get to the Bazaar (wasn't in game at time I left) I will be able to see which of these are available. Get a lil Wis &amp; mana increase and I can start reducing the critter population and relieve them of their wealth. :) <br />
