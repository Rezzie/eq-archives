Bit of pointless trivia for you...<br />

My main is a Warlock, so that is where I found this site from.</div></div><hr />

I've been getting very tired of blizzard's warlock forums, and that looks like it's about as good for locks as this is for druids.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I'll probably be switching to my druid as my main once I get him up to 60.<br />
<br />
Anyone else notice that a lot of warlock players are drawn to the druid class as an alt? I think it has something to do with locks lacking an escape method, and druids being the best class at escaping. :alc:</div></div><hr />

A lot of druids have warlock alts. I think its because it is still an extreemly versitle class, with answers to almost everything. + you can get some truly sick crits which is something Druids lacked for a long time.<br />

<br />
First alt is a lv 43 shadow preist<br />
Second alt is a lv 19 UD lock.  <br />
<br />
I love the versatility of all three classes.  Shadow priests can be wicked dps / face melters, as well as awesome healers.  Everyone wants a priest in their group regardless.  Warlocks are wanted in groups regardless, and are versatile in any situation - imp for groups, vw for tanking, succy for dmg / cc, fellhunter for whatever they are used for (im only lv 19 with it lol).<br />
<br />
I can't imagine being one dimensional would be as fun or challenging, just poking away like a rogue, or just bashing away like a warrior.  Though to be fair I should play each class first before judging them.  It's funny talking to people who say &quot;I can't imagine playing a squishy class.  Casters ftl&quot;  Lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">01-27-2006, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have tried every class til level 5...some to level 10+....and I have to say that Casters are my favorite.  I would have to say right now that Priests and Druids are my favorites....but I also like Warlocks and Mages.  Shamans are kinda fun....but I still like the others better.  I get too bored with a Rogue and Warrior.  Hunter I haven't played high enough for a pet...but I just don't see those being as enjoyable (I have a friend that has a level 59 hunter).  Paladins...I played til level 5 and couldn't take anymore...just not my kinda class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 37 Warlock, 26 Druid and 19 Hunter.<br />
<br />
My favourite - atm, it changes every time i play near enough - would be the Hunter, but that was only one I started recently and have been playing a lot in the last week.<br />
<br />
I didn't get bored of the other two, but I find if I engross myself in a new character I get a lot of Rested XP when I come back to one of the others.<br />
<br />
I am really interested in Mages and Priests too tho. To a lesser extent I am also interested in rolling a Shaman, but I am not too keen on the Horde generally. I find their areas really boring in comparison to the Alliance's (Alliance FTW :behindcom)<br />
<br />
But, in short, Druids and Warlocks are similar in different ways.<br />
<br />
Off Topic, does anyone know a decent Hunters website??</div></div><hr />
