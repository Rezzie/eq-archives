How is this done? I just recently returned and trying to play catch up and get a butt load of crystals to buy some nice Aug's. Thank you in advance. Im 67 3/4's to 68 and about 5k Mana.</div></div><hr />

You likely can't take out any summoners, so you'll have to stick to kitable missions.  Some of them are easy but take forever.  Lavaspinner Locals is kitable, and requires no faction beyond the default starting faction.<br />

It's a very popular mission for groups because it's fast and easy 40 crystals and the chance for Metallic Drake Scales and Glossy Drake Hides to drop.  I don't know if the creator himself summons though.</div></div><hr />

And if you're casual, and came back after the DoN craze was fading, you don't get in enough missions to get the mission yourself.  That's the boat I'm in.  Need more faction so I can get Creator.  The only pickup groups I see forming for DoN want level 70s with good gear so they can rip thru a mission.<br />

edit - craze, not crazy.  And for you old-time Steve Martin fans, I said socket, not sprocket!  :)</div></div><hr />

The mobs break root way too often, they cast a lot (just like every other mob in DoN), they repop and can bring some surprises to people that are used to passive soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Creator also repops mobs. I tried soloing this just for XP, but caught up fighting off adds of repops. I don't know if it can be solo'd any more (to win). Lair of the Black Wing I hear is solo and kiteable tho. Only ever did that mission once. And the only reason I got that mission is cuz Netty felt sorry for me and had a spot open in his uber farm group.</div></div><hr />
