I used to keep up on whats what for computer hardware, though have slacked off in the past 6 months.  I just found out that the fan on my ATI video card stopped working, and the card is pretty much overheating and locking up my system all the time.  I have a Dell (ugh) and cant really modify the case to add on any fans or cooling systems.  Everything else is pretty solid - 2.5p4, 768ram, 120gb hd.  <br />
<br />
I need a new VCard, though dont know what to get.  I'd like to spend between $200 and $250 and get a pretty good card, preferrably one that doesn't run too hot.  Anyone have any suggestions, recommendations or 'stay-away-from's?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

I have no preference between the two. I've tried them both, they seemed to work just as well as eachother. <br />
Here (http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.asp?N=2010380048+4018&amp;Submit=ENE&amp;SubCategory=48) is a nice link that lists 66 video cards between $200 and $300. Newegg has relatively cheap prices on Hardware. (their cases are overpriced to hell though)</div></div><hr />

LOL.  I have the Dimension 8250, and have been super happy with it.  I was saying ugh regarding the case configuration, and fact that I cant add in any new cooling.  I tend to play WoW for hours, and that heats up the case soemthing wicked.  I have already been through 2 case fans.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice on the X800GT.  Any suggestions on how I can keep my cpu / vcard cooler knowing the Dell Dimension case?<br />
<br />
I assume its AGP, not PCI-Express x16, as the system itself is about 2 years old, though have no idea.  What exactly is the difference?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">06-29-2006, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference between AGP and PCI-Excpress is the amount of data that can pass through.  Much like the move from PCI to AGP many years ago, it is now from AGP to PCI-Express.  <br />
<br />
I've got an nVidia 6800, and really couldn't be happier.  <br />
<br />
You've probably got an AGP slot and should be able to get a pretty good card for $200 - $250 ( www.pricewatch.com ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create resurrected</div><div class="date">07-17-2006, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the AGP 8x interface, I think you're spending too much at $200-250.<br />
<br />
If you want to max out what an AGP 8x slot can do, look at the nVidia 7800GS series.  I prefer Newegg (2-3 day standard)to the random (you may get your stuff tomorrow, maybe two weeks from now) vendors from pricewatch.  You'll spend a bit more than budget, short of $300.  Specific Product Link (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130269)  You'll bottleneck at system RAM, possibly HDD interface if you're running IDE.<br />
<br />
A much more practical option is to buy a lower-end card and also add system RAM.  The  6800XT series (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130268) is a good fit for your other system specs.  That leaves some financial room for more RAM, which is likely to be your bottleneck after the video upgrade.  Get up to at least 1GB, pref 1.5GB.  Get cpu-z, a program that can grab your system specs, from here (http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php), run it, and tell me your RAM speed, timing, number of total RAM slots on the motherboard, and number of slots filled on the motherboard.  I'll recommend compatible RAM once I see the spec.  If we install the wrong stuff we'll either waste money or piss off your motherboard, neither of which we want.<br />
<br />
Please note that you could replace your entire core (MB, Proc, RAM, PSU, Video) up to AMD 64 (you won't run 64, but capable upgrade), 1GB RAM, PCI-E, at around the $500 mark.  I'll spec something nice if you're interested.<br />
<br />
ATI vs. nVidia:  In straight graphics capability, nVidia consistently outperforms ATI per dollar.  Per dollar, however, ATI offers more functionality, such as built-in TV tuners or multi-monitor support.  I tend to buy the right make for the job, nVidia for main graphics, and a PCI ATI with integrated TV-tuner/recording functionality to run my second monitor and hook into my home entertainment setup.<br />
<br />
Let us know what you decide to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm at work, so I cant access my system setup, but will definitley DL cpu-z when I get home.  For some reason I have a really weird type of RAM that has to be installed in pairs, and is ridiculously more expensive than other types of RAM.  I play FarCry and some other games, so I want to get a decent enough vcard to handle them, but certainly dont need anything ridiculous.  I don't watch TV or anything on my comp, got a nice TV for that lol.  TY for the dollar comparison between ATI and NVIDIA.<br />
<br />
I agree about the RAM though, I've been thinking for a while about really needing to get over 1gb, but I'd have to order 512 more, not just 256 (have to install in pairs - currently have 2x128, 2x256).</div></div><hr />

That's the video card I have in my Shuttle.  My boyfriend helped me pick it out.  It seems to work just fine for me...I play WoW, some RTS games....and my boyfriend used it to be CS:S.  He really likes the way it plays CS:S.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would throw that in there.  I don't know a whole lot about what's out there....but I have to say for the money and all...it's given me no problems and I love the way it looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason I have a really weird type of RAM that has to be installed in pairsI'm going to simplify, well, alot:  So nobody come in and pick me apart on technicalities. <br />
<br />
The old technology is is commonly referred to as SDRAM.  The new technology is also SDRAM, but called DDR, DDR2, or DDR3.  As soon as you move to DDR, your RAM must be paired (same size, two chips) to take advantage of the technology.<br />
<br />
All your RAM chips should have the same CAS latency timings.  Smaller numbers are better.  <br />
<br />
All your RAM chips should have the same speed.  There are two numbers that define speed, but they are interchangeable.  For example, a common RAM is DDR400.  DDR400 speed is the exact equivalent of PC3200.  There is a direct conversion ratio for each DDR (ie DDR, DDR2), to PCxxxx speed.<br />
<br />
On your motherboard you have two sets of paired slots, for a total of 4 slots.  You will want to look at the speed and timings of your 2x256 pair, buy a set of 2x512 to match, then replace and eBay your 2x128 pair.  <br />
<br />
As long as the new stuff matches, the installation is the easiest of any upgrade.  Unplug the old, plug in the new, turn the computer on, you're done.<br />
<br />
You *should* have enough info between this post and my previous to pick out your RAM yourself.  I'd be happy to double-check once you fill me in on the cpu-z info.  <br />
<br />
Alot of Newegg stuff ships from CA, so you should receive your RAM/video order in a day or two max.</div></div><hr />

I'm good with installing stuff, I built my buddy a computer a few years back from scratch.  Just haven't been paying much attention for the past 6-8 months as I've had other things that have taken my attention.   Thanks for the info on vcards.  I just got a fan that fits in a pci slot (takes up 2 spaces, connects in just 1) that is blowing a lot of the heat off my vcard, so its working decent for now.  Probably going to do some more research this week, and order a new vcard this weekend.  Leaning toward NVIDIA.  Create - I'll post my ram specs when I get home.  thx.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create resurrected</div><div class="date">07-17-2006, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to mention:  You may need a new Power Supply Unit (PSU) as well.  All the PCI-E, but even some of the high-end AGP 8x cards require a special power connection.  You'll want to check the card spec and your PSU to make sure you don't run into a situation where you need the power connection and don't have it.<br />
<br />
If you need the PSU as well, it'd be worth minimizing cost now to get by, then go for a full core replacement and eBay the old when you've built up enough cash.<br />
<br />
Cost minimization alternatives:<br />
1.  Cost $0:  Remove the side of the case.  Place a table fan blowing into the case from and angle, like 45deg pointing into and towards the back.  This, along with that PCI-plug-in fan, could get you by for awhile.<br />
<br />
2.  Cost $50:  Buy a used card off eBay.<br />
<br />
...and, just because I'm on a roll today:<br />
Abit A8N SLI (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16813127207)<br />
Athlon 3500+ Venice HT (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16819103533)<br />
1GB Kingston CL3 (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820141423)<br />
Antec 500W PSU (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16817103937)<br />
<br />
That totals to about $355.  All you need is a nVidia 6800XT (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16814130261) for $120, totalling $475.  When you're ready in a few months, grab another 6800XT at the $100 mark for SLI, and you're running damn near top of the line for under $600 in the end, under $500 now.  You'll still have room for improvement with that MB, including a RAID 0 or 1 HDD setup, later-model PCI-E SLI video, another set of RAM chips, and the MB already supports AMD's next tech spec for processors.  Actually, your current MB probably uses DDR400 CL3 and you could take your 2x256 and plop them into this setup.<br />
<br />
Really, the best thing I can recommend, is to hold off a bit while the new Intel line takes it's place and drives the cost of the 64bit AMD's down, then make the $500 hop into a AMD 64, PCI-E SLI setup.  eBay your old stuff for somewhere around $100-125, and net out with around $350 spent for a new core.  That's getting you into the bottom end of the latest technology for a net $100 increase from your current budget.<br />
<br />
TMI, I know...It's my greatest fault.</div></div><hr />

Intel's recent release of new technology is driving the price of P4's down.  It would seem that we're coming into a 'best value' point for P4's with large memory bus speeds within the next month.<br />
<br />
Dell, as always, has the latest &amp; greatest for dirt cheap.  Take a look:<br />
<br />
Dell Home has Inspiron E1505 laptop for a base price of $953 - auto 35% off = $619. If you have a dollar off coupon ($20 off $200, $30 off $300, $45 off $400) it will also apply. You can try your luck in Dell Back to School game to get them for free as well. Thanks Wammer<br />
<br />
To save an extra 5%, use your Discover card to pay (Details) or your Dell Preferred Account for 2% savings. In the best case scenario, your final price will be $619 - $45 coupon - 5% Discover = $545 plus applicable taxes.<br />
