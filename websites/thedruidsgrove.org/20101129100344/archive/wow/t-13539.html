<br />
The raid group I'm a part of in the new guild had struggled a little with slime management on Rotface...and I thought THAT was hard.<br />
<br />
Then...I met Festergut.  Anyone have any tips on healing that fight?<br />
<br />
It seemed like our tanks were getting 1-2 shotted after his 3rd inhale, no matter how fast we spam-healed them.  I had heard also that FesterGut gains parry-haste on 25man...does he do the same on 10m?<br />
<br />
Anyone have any advice on this fight for a healer, or even just advice I can toss out to our group for next week's attempts?<br />
<br />
We had 3 heals, 1 Holy Priest, 2 Resto Druids.  I blew so many cooldowns trying to keep our tank up on inhale #3...NS+HT and pretty much whatever I could think of to try and keep the tank's health up...but we were still losing our tank on that last inhale.  I know tanks are supposed to be blowing all of their CD's on Fester's last inhale too...are there any other tricks to this fight?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">04-02-2010, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hrm, if you're doing this fight like that there are a couple of things: <br />
<br />
2 Holy priests + 2 resto druids are not the most awesome combo for tank healing.  It can work but it's tricky depending on your druid's spec.<br />
<br />
Are you glyphed for nourish?  If you spec empowered touch/nourish glyph your nourish spamming will be a lot more powerful for this fight.  It works a lot better than a priest going disc (disc priest tank healing, while said to be awesome, is actually still a bit tricky).  <br />
<br />
Your tank *does* need to be hitting cooldowns but not all at once.  What we generally do is have them chain cooldowns.  Like if your tank is a warrior, they can pop Shield Wall when he first hits 3 inhales, then when shield wall wears off, Last Stand and Enraged Regen or something.  <br />
<br />
Have your holy priest pop Guardian Spirit on the tank when Shield Wall pops off for the increased healing.  <br />
<br />
As a druid don't worry about your cooldowns.  NS+HT is good, swiftmend off CD is great but the #1 tool of tank healing as a druid is Rejuve/Regrowth hots on a tank and then spam the crap outta nourish.  <br />
<br />
Festergut does not parry-haste, even on 25 man.  If he did that then I think every tank in the world would die instantly.  &gt;.&lt;  <br />
<br />
at 3 inhales though he has a .9 second swing timer and is doing about 25-30k per swing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-07-2010, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah HA! Forgot all about the increased attack speed after 3 inhales.<br />
<br />
I am specced Empowered touch and Glyphed for Nourish.  I. Love. Nourish.  I think I have the relic that increases the spellpower on Nourish as well...<br />
<br />
We seem to really struggle with the transition between tanks.  I think we can get this if we can master a perfect transition.  I think we've always lost our 2nd tank almost instantly after the tank switch.  Maybe that's a good starting point.<br />
<br />
I never thought to check the numbers on incoming damage on the 3rd inhale and how fast it was coming...it's helpful to know and maybe I can come up with a better plan now that I know =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kromas</div><div class="date">04-14-2010, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of second before the third inhale stop what your doing and get all hots up on the tank thats going to be taking the damage. When the third inhale hits all you should be doing is spamming nourish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squishy</div><div class="date">04-14-2010, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What we do on Festergut in 10m is Shield/LB x3 timed with the 3rd inhale. We usually 2 heal this fight with 1 disc priest, and myself. I usually let my LBs bloom but during this period I keep them rolling. Of course regrowth/rejuv are up as well. I know our priest is getting the double bubble thing on the current tank at that point too, It might be worth it to ask the priest if they can go disc, the bubbles + hots are actually a really good combo although your priest might not like any meters they see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-29-2010, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all for the replies!  It's actually been really helpful!<br />
<br />
Once we all got the concept of the fight down and got the tank transitions worked out a little better, it went way easier.<br />
<br />
We were having some transition trouble, but now with hotting up the second tank just before the taunt, it's a whole lot easier.  It was myself and a holy priest last night and we one-shotted him and Rotface.  <br />
<br />
Prof Putricide on the other hand...oi...we got into P3 and had some bad luck with timing...we still had a slime up that destroyed our shaman and then just the slime pool locations made it incredibly hard to maneuver around to be in range of most of the people in need of healing.  We're going to try again tonight.  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have fun on Putricide - for my guild, he was as tough as Sindragosa.  Maybe a bit tougher.<br />
<br />
LK for the first time this weekend &lt;crosses fingers&gt;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">05-14-2010, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go go Raging!<br />
<br />
I'm dying to see the LK fight.  I'm not sure I'll get to see it before the level cap gets moved to 80 though.  =\  We usually clear up to Putricide and end up stopping there every week because my raid team can't seem to get him down.<br />
<br />
We got so close the one night, had him to like 10% but wiped because the room filled with slime too quickly.  I think it was a transitional issue from p2 into p3 because I really don't think any of us were expecting to get to phase 3 lol.  After that we lost momentum and haven't gotten him that far down since...<br />
<br />
And the good news is that Festergut and Rotface are no longer ridiculous roadblocks for us.  =)  Rotface sometimes takes a few tries, but for the most part, I think we've got them down.</div></div><hr />
