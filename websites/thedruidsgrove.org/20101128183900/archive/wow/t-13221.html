Between all my forms my UI was so cluttered and ugly, I had to finally cave in and start looking into some addons. I tried out a bunch last night until i decided with bartender. got that all fixed so I have only spells needed by that form to show. <br />

Now i want to move my healthbar somewhere else so i can put recount put there. Any suggestions of which UI, and/or some other cool stuff i can do. I know xpearl can but when i installed that, its got so much grid stuff that i'm worried it'll add lag in 25 mans</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">02-10-2009, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I encountered a similar issue.  I was using bartender since TBC, and it has never really worked correctly in WotLK, so I tried Titanpanel, and experienced similar issues with Lag and overall functionality failures (read: bars not shifting with me, stupid gargoyle blocking needed items/buttons...etc)<br />
<br />
Finally I went back to vanilla WoW interface!  For those like me, who have not used it in a few years...try it again!  It is not the TBC interface I ditched a few years ago.  It now is much more customizable, shifts actionbars with forms, and best of all....no additional RAM consumption.  I found this by accident when I had a HD crash on my &quot;Good&quot; computer and then jumped on my &quot;old&quot; computer for a raid.  When my comp with an integrated VC was out performing my $200+ 512mb VC on the other computer, I decided it was time to slim down the addons!<br />
<br />
I strongly reccomend just using the WoW bars that come standard.  You get like 6, visable (12 button) bars, I think, +4 different &quot;Action bars&quot; which shift with you.</div></div><hr />

/script MainMenuBarLeftEndCap:Hide() MainMenuBarRightEndCap:Hide()<br />
<br />
I haven't figured out how to make it stick, but I just made a macro and put it on my 2nd bar and click it whenever I need to see the stuff I have down in the corner of my UI (tomtom).<br />
<br />
FWIW, I use the stock UI as well along with very few addons....<br />
<br />
Itemrack (or is it outfitter??? I don't recall)<br />
OmniCC (cooldown thingy)<br />
BadKitty<br />
Pitbull (frames, with lots of default stuff disabled)<br />
Omen (frankly, as a tank, I'm not sure you really need this.  As a DPS the builtin warnings are probably enough to let you know you need to slow down a bit)<br />
Pawn<br />
Gatherer<br />
Auctioneer<br />
TomTom<br />
QuestHelper<br />
<br />
I often disable the bottom 4 whenever I raid just so they don't give me any issues (not that they do, but just in case).</div></div><hr />

They are all memory hogs that serve little purpose inside of a raid.</div></div><hr />
