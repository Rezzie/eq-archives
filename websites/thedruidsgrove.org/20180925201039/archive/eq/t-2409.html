With the new exp changes, I am not sure where are some good places that a lv 57 druid can solo (either quad or root/rot). I tried quading raptors and the exp was dismally small compared to before. Any suggestions on what I can do?</div></div><hr />

&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Maiden's Eye&lt;/span&gt; - Ravenous Beast make excellent pets, but only one in 4 is charmable.  Once you find one, make camp someplace, and pull for your pet.  My favorite spot was the Coteries closest to DSP zone.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Plane of Nightmares&lt;/span&gt; - Ravenous Nighstalkers camp.  Zone in, face the zone wall and follow it to your left until you run smack into them.  You'll need harmony of nature here.  Charm one, pull a second, and let the beat each other up making sure your pet barely wins by doting the other one.  Break charm via camo, grab another pet and finish your old pet off while pulling your next victim.  Rince / Repeat.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Chardok&lt;/span&gt; - Never done this, but every druid who does says it's great.  Charm a Chokadai at the Zone out or where the slaves are I think.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quadding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br />
&lt;em&gt;c3 is very helpfull at 57 quadding because you don't get your new quad spell until 58.  The following locations are great at 58, but doable at 57 with c3 or an above average mana pool.&lt;/em&gt;<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Cobalt Scar&lt;/span&gt; - At 57 you should be able to solo pull Othimir Warriors.  Only Chief Kalan and the 2 named guys closest to Skyshrine will require Harmony to pull.  Great Money Making Quad spot, but only room for 1 or 2 druids.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Maiden's Eye&lt;/span&gt; - Toiler Hill.  By the lake (boathouse) in the corner between UP and the 4-arm fort there is a hill flooded with Umbral Toilers.  Great Quadding at this level.  Watch for adds, as they have a decent aggro radius and id you get too close to the wall of the 4-arm camp, you will get 4-arm adds as well.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;The Grey&lt;/span&gt; - Backside of the Temple in the Middle of the zone is where I spent 58-60 quadding.  Quad snakes for EXP, quad or root/dot golems for loot between spawns.  Solo pulling shouldn't be a problem, and the only adds you get there from roamers are from trains to proplr running to Ssra Temple.  Named Snakes and Golems I suggest root/dotting.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Scarlet Desert&lt;/span&gt; The Plateu - quad sun revenents.  sun reavers are casters, root dot them.  The aliens up there start non-kos, so you can quad around them.  Thay can be good quadding too, but the sun revs better and easier.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Wakening Lands&lt;/span&gt; - Suits of Sentinal Armor along the North wall.  High HP's, but quaddable and drop quest gems and SK armor.  decent EXP, but only if other camps are taken.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Root-DoTing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Umbral Plains&lt;/span&gt; - disturbed elysian remains.  Nice of Verant to make the only MOBs soloable in UP drop killer druid armor.  Invis up and follow the Zone wall to the right from ME.  The corner just passed the Vex Thal zone will be your pull-to spot.  Keep following the wall around a bit and look to your left when you see the terrain flatten out.  Pull wanderers from there.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Skyfire Mountains&lt;/span&gt; - Named Cycle either at BW zone or Ragefire area.  Look for unique MOBs on tracking and use invis to pull them to safety.  By unique I mean either a mob with capital letters like &quot;Black Scar&quot;, &quot;Guardian of Felia&quot;, and &quot;Faerie of Dismay&quot; or MOBs you see only one of like &quot;a lava walker&quot;, &quot;a soul devourer&quot;, &quot;a shadow drake&quot;.  Once you kill one, another named on the cycle will pop in a few seconds.  Awesome thing about druid tracking is the new spawn will appear at the top of the list to eliminate any more guess work or searching.  Not the greatest EXP, but all mobs have a high probability of dropping 55+ spells.  I used to make bank doing this until the bazaar came out and spell prices plummeted.<br />
<br />
&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Plane of Justice&lt;/span&gt; Death Row - the hallway on the way to Muavin where you have to go for the PoV/PoS flag.  Tough to root dot here, but very nice EXP and loot including Etheral Parchments.<br />
<br />
Those are just a few places I frequested in my 57-60 days.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

What stats/spells/items are implied to be able to do things such as the elysian in UP? I went there once trying to solo and got wiped extremely fast. I pulled a caster by mistake. oops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(for USAFknight77) At 56, you should be able to solo Disturbed Elysian Remains. Having a DoD clicker (ES vambrace/velious bracer), Epic and c3 helps a lot and will cut down on kiting time.<br />

<br />
In my experience, 57-60 went fastest in ME via charming.  Granted, it was pre-PoP, but I could usually get 1-2 blues per hour (even in 59) which I was content with.  Quadding in ME was good too, but there were typically 2-3 other quadders to compete with and that slowed down the process considerably.  <br />
<br />
My gear was far from uber, however, so maybe other folks could do it much faster somewhere else.  Just my 2cp.<br />

<br />
But, I did get 70% exp in six hours until I got level 58.<br />

Send me an email if you would like to know.  I bet most of the older people already know of it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for elysians, I kill them with ES arms right click and kodiaks c3..and has about 40% mana left after kill at 57 without any fancy equip...getting c3 that last for 3 hours is worth it guys.<br />

Exp and drops are better.  Disease might be a little more dangerous because of the spiders, but you get used to it.  I get an AA in a little over an hour in PoD with a chance at ethereal parchment.</div></div><hr />
