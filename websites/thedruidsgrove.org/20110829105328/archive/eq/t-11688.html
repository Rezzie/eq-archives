See below for a faked magelo using all DON bought items. Be aware that a majority of the items requires level 70.<br />
 <br />
1) The head type 9 augment: magelo won't let me use the FT1 aug, otherwise I should be able to get FT15.<br />
 <br />
2) The only major focus effect not available is affliction efficiency V.<br />
 <br />
3) AC is pretty low, but stats and resists are high (I am 50 over limit for both stat and wis).<br />

You point out that this is a fake Magelo gearwise, but is it based on your real character?  I ask because that is the strangest AA route I have ever seen :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">07-08-2005, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it's totally faked. I added these AAs to raise the maximum stat/resist caps. My real magelo is half ornate - half elysian with no DON gear.<br />
 <br />
My main is only level 63. To fake this magelo I have to create a level 70 dru.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">07-08-2005, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why would a non-raiding druid care so much about resists?  if you want to make it look impressive replace some of those tear stones with hp augs (ie on belt.)  You have +14 stat augs in some slots where HP augs from DoN could go as well<br />
 <br />
heh off topic, but i remember how during early LDoN I had 3,500 hp unbuffed (check my alternate magelo and add aug hp ;p) and that was hot **** for a pre-VT druid, and nowadays people can indirectly /bazaar a gear set thats &gt; elem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">07-08-2005, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the suggestion. I'll make improvement by lowering stats and resists and replacing with hp. <br />
<br />
However I just wonder why the AC is so low. The DON tanned dragonhide set has more AC than ornate, yet my 63 dru wearing ornate/elysian has 800+ total AC compare to the faked level 70's 600 some total AC. Where went wrong?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
You need to update the skill defence to make the AC look correct!<br />
 <br />
I built a fake Pally magelo from all DON items and was surprised at the result... DON has raised the casual player to another great level if you ask me.<br />
 <br />
Cheers,<br />

 <br />
It looks fine now. AC is 1098 and ATK is 900+. He probably can tank now :). I'll make more changes to raise his hp. <br />
 <br />
It looks like DON makes 99% of previous gears obsolete.  Time to get to level 70 and save 30k crystals!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Audon</div><div class="date">07-10-2005, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya DoN is a great expansion for non-raiders. Its pretty easy to get to 70 while you collect those crystals also(as long as you can get groups). I would go with mana augs over hp though. Dunno how much 8500ish hp buffed vs. 8k hp buffed will do, but an extra 550 mana is an extra heal(which is 3k+ hp). I also didn't see the FT augs from both camps. You can spend ebons and radiants to get 2 FT3 and 2 FT2 augs, which can help you get to 20FT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">07-10-2005, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only looked at the Keeper's merchant, should have looked at the evil side as well. That will give me more choices. Will there be an issue of faction when dealing with the opposite side merchants?<br />
 <br />
Edit: just updated the magelo using both good and evil merchants. Was able to achieve 20 FT. Stats still overflowed a bit, but I left them as is since most +stat augs also have +30hp/mana, and most +sv augs also have +35 hp/mana. Since they add both hp and mana, I think they are better than +55hp or +55mana only augs.<br />
 <br />
There were still 8 slots (for augs) to spare, which I put <br />
2 x  +12 to all saves, <br />
2 x 5 point DS<br />
2 x 4 point DS<br />
2 x 4 point hp regen.<br />
 <br />
So I have 18 DS and 8 HP regen. These are all type 7 slots. I'll look for augs from other places to replace some of these. (This set of gear does not have affliction efficiency V focus so that is one consideration.) Another thinking is to put two +3FT augs to type 7 slots, and free up 6 type 9 slots with +1 FT each. This way we can put 6 type 9  +hp and +mana augs.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Murams anger is magic based. Burning affliction 5 applies to fire based dots as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Audon</div><div class="date">07-11-2005, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Faction is not an issue for buying DoN stuff. The NPCs in each camp are non-aggro so you can invis past the KoS guards for whichever camp hates you and go to the crystal vendor. You just need the proper type of crystal (ebon or radiant).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Audon</div><div class="date">07-11-2005, 06:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The DS and regen augs are pretty much useless, as is haste. Put raw mana or hp augs in all the type 7 slots that can fit. There are 55 hp or 55 mana augs for face, neck, shoulders, back and waist, and there are 50 hp or 50 mana augs for chest, legs, feet, arms, and head. As I said, I prefer the mana after a certain level of hps. <br />
<br />
If you are looking for non-DoN stuff for non-raiders there is plenty of stuff in OoW also. You can save aug slots(for the raw mana/hp stuff) by getting focus effects and FT built into non-DoN gear. My magelo has nothing in it that took more than 1 group(other than epic 1.5). Plus, getting fully auged DoN gear in every slot would take forever. It took me quite a few runs to get what I have, and I was getting 2-3x the crystals each run from bots. I doubt anyone could do that many missions without getting totally burned out(or going insane).  :)</div></div><hr />
