<br />
If you have a Shadowknight tank then they would be first on the list. Their snare is a DoT and adds to thier aggro.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a SK tank then a necro also does damage - although depending upon the ability of your tank to hold aggro and your healer to heal quickly you may not chose to go with necro's because of the aggro genarated.<br />
<br />
Rangers would be the next choice, especially at the higher levels because the snare should be used in conjunction with root to get aggro and 'root-park adds' - if there is no chanter. Rangers do not have alot of use for thier mana, since they mostly use it to self buff or DS, so they shouldnt have a problem having enough to snare.<br />
<br />
Wizards are best to save thier mana for nuking, that is thier specially and snaring would be a waste of dps for them. Unless they are the ONLY snare capable class in the group they would be at the bottom of the list.<br />
<br />
Druids - when not healing - should be right near the top, assuming there is not SK and no ranger. Rangers usually have a few more hp's and therefore can take a couple of hits if they get aggro from the snare.<br />
<br />
If the druid is healing, I do not believe that they shoud be snaring also (unless they are the only snare capable class). Snaring too early means you may get aggro and we all know that druid heals genarate enough of that without help :p</div></div><hr />

#2 - Let them get on the agro list higher than me since there is a chance they can tank the mob if for any insane reason the MT goes doe (Or if they are the MT in theg roup to let them hold agro better)<br />
#3 - If I am on my druid in an exp group it means I am healing and I try and let another class snare because I get enough agro just from healing/nuking sometimes.</div></div><hr />

The most important thing is for all snare-capable classes to communicate who is snaring so you aren't wasting mana or get one of those classics where you have 3 or 4 snare-capable classes and no one snares :)  Then you have to consider who will actually remember to snare :P</div></div><hr />

I tend to not snare though, because I've become so used to other people doing it or the mob not running. It also depends on if your group can hold agro well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I said necro before reading any of the above. And for several good reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Necros almost always use it anyway - theyre used to it soloing, and since it overwrites our snare (but not vice versa) my casting time is better spent elsewhere. I have yet to meet a necro that doesnt snare no matter who is in their experience group - until after I ask that is.<br />
<br />
2. Extra damage. Not much, but Ill take some over none any day. <br />
<br />
3. Mana - well given that they regen mana way better than I can the higher mana cost is really a nonissue. <br />
<br />
4. Snare time - nothing lasts 15min anymore, hell most things die under a minute - so a minute snare is all that is really needed. <br />
<br />
5. I usually have a healing roll of some kind - I likely wouldnt be there otherwise. Better them to get snap aggro then me. <br />
<br />
6. Versatality - Necros have little else to do on a regular mob but pump out the dots/pet/wrack. Whereas we are likely needed to heal/ds/regen/dps and another cast would just add to that.<br />
<br />
7. Necros are in love with their snare-. IF they can cast it - they will. Ive tried =)<br />

Anyone else in the group who is capable of snaring should do so, especially rangers. Druids should be the last one snaring, period.

<br />
As a wizard, I hate it.  It's 100 more mana than ensnare, very often resisted, and in ldons is notorious for setting off barrels and crates.   Tanks often pull mobs too close to me, so I have to back way up (assuming I have room) so as not to catch myself.  And if there is no cc for multiple mobs, one snare grabs aggro from all of them..eep.<br />

With my SK, I always snare.  CD is one of the better aggro tools.</div></div><hr />

I can't remember have removing snare from my spell lineup nomatter who im grouped with.  Spell lots are an issue but there are some spells that you cannot afford the mem time, these being  Heals (usually KR + SI), DD (Sfire or Frost), Evac and Snare.  If im short on spell slots and Exodus is up I'll do without the succor.  If were in a tight area I like to have root memed at all times too.  Its nice to have buffs memed and ready, but people can wait for a new damage shield, mobs wont wait to be snared before running off.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
As for who should snare in xp groups, Rangers &gt; Wizards &gt; necros &gt; druid.<br />
 <br />
Rangers and wizards have almost no agro on their snare, and since they dont have to watch hp timing on spells isnt as important as a druid. 5+ Snare resists can make late on a heal if you been XPing for 3+ hours straight. <br />
 <br />
Druid snare is generally just high agro. If im grouped with a non guildy tank I find myself pulling agro at least once or twice just with ensnare. <br />
 <br />
I've tested the agro on ensnare before -- I kited a mob and just chained ensnare and asked a wizzy to nuke as fast as they could to try to pull agro, and my name didn't leave HoTT box. Another time I tanked a mini namer during a raid, and with just chaining ensnare (ok and i few debuffs, I cheated) I kept my name in HOTT box the entire time.<br />
 <br />
Edit -- Whoops, been awhile since I've seen a SK, forgot about them =(.  If the SK is tanking in group they should be the snarer, since most of them already do it for agro anyways.</div></div><hr />

Amen!<br />
 <br />
I prefer to be the sole snarer, or not snaring at all. I don't share that task well. Now that we have our new snares that don't resist as much I prefer to snare, even if I am healing. I don't entirely trust necro/SK snares and dont trust wizzy snares at all. However, if their is another druid or a ranger in the group, they are welcome to it, and I have learned to accept that for reasons of agro, SK tanks should take snares too. But it makes me crazy when they don't keep it snared.</div></div><hr />

I agree, snaring can slow down pulling especially on long runs.  I used to love pulling in EJ with a DoT running back to camp then snaring the mob as it ran towards the group.  I am a master at this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">04-21-2007, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Hand of Ro to pull on short pulls, since it's a pretty low agro spell and saves me time debuffing.<br />
<br />
The proper druid pulling spell for a long run back to camp is low damage nuke so you don't do enough damage to the mob that a summoner will keep you from reaching camp, and the tank can snatch agro from you without having to taunt.<br />
<br />
For a long pull I use a White Ceramic Band and click a 4 point fire nuke on the mob instead of snaring.  Clickable from inventory and gives me a low damage pulling tool without sacrificing a gem slot, which if I am pulling, I probably have a harmony in whatever free utility spot I have.<br />
<br />
But I digress.  We were talking about snaring, not pulling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's a long run and the mob runs fast, consider Stinging Swarm or Drones of Doom.  They (along with higher level spells in the same line) have a base range of 250 instead of 200.<br />
<br />
If you want it in clicky form, Velious quest bracers and Elder Spiritist Vambraces have Drones of Doom.  Orb of Clinging Death (with clicky Swarming Death) would work too if Swarming Death is not enough to bring a mob below 97%.</div></div><hr />
