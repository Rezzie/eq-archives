<br />
With new AA and new levels, it is now as much of a challenge as it used to be, but it's still great fun to learn the zone.</div></div><hr />

Almost every fight is different and you will die a lot learning them but I wouldnt say they were &quot;hard&quot; as such. <br />
Clearing trash is in some cases harder than the dragons, 2 or more flurries in camp will be harder to deal with than Feshlak/Kreizzen/Miranella/Dagarn/Koi Dokken. Triplet split is a steep learning curve for monks and Vyemm is fun for the first time at least.<br />
<br />
It could be the last time you have fun in new zone so enjoy it. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinjiin</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Make sure you have (at least one) non-kos mage to CoV so he/she can CoH all of the party to the area right before Aary's pit.  Be sure to CoH the FD players 1st to clear the hatchlings.  If you plan on fighting your way to NToV from the zone in this could take multiple hours.<br />
<br />
When you pull Aary from it's pit, bring it close (but not all the way) to the 90 degree turn so that your casters can hide behind the wall.  Aary casts an AoE silence (cannot cast for about 60 seconds or so).  Your healers will need to hug this wall to stay out of the AoE range.  I suggest that your raid leader(s) have good knowledge of Aary before you kill it b/c it is at the entrance to NToV and you won't be able enter the area without killing it first.  But as stated above, once Aary is killed NToV is alot of fun and the other dragons will be cake (kinda =).<br />
<br />
Consider the flurry drakes to be like a mini-Vindi.  Getting 2 of them in camp could be trouble.  And make sure the raid leaders know strats for each dragon.  Many of them cast AoE spells and there are ways to fight them so that casters can avoid being hit by positioning themselves correctly.<br />
<br />
NToV is by far the zone I had the most fun raiding in.  Have a good time.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure we have it easier (than the first folks who explored there) with additional levels and with some folks who've raided there with other guilds previously, but still we're learning, developing our own ways of dealing with some mobs, and having a blast.<br />
<br />
Killing Aary the first time (on our second pull!), we felt like we'd earned our way in for real.  We feel a sense of accomplishment, a sense of earning our way in, that only a big fight fought well and hard can give.<br />
<br />
It's a whole different world than the one time we tagged along with a more upper tier guild!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">01-22-2003, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, you need to patch the MT hard on the flurry drakes until clerics get heals under control. Those things can get tough if people aren't paying attention. After that it's basically just nukes and make sure things don't gate.<br />
<br />
The rooted mobs are simple, but you won't get your debuffs to land unless you're standing under it so you'll have to wait until the fight begins to cast the Ro debuff line (and make sure you do this). Pay attention to where casters are supposed to stand to avoid aoe's.<br />
<br />
Mobile bosses are a bit thougher because there's a pull involved as well as positioning. It is a big learning curve for monks so be prepared for a lot of waiting around at times.<br />
<br />
Other than that it's filled with drakes and worms that are similar to every other drake and worm in the zone (WToV and HoT). They can drop kael quest armor.</div></div><hr />

They are most of the named drakes and anything with Defender (capitol D).  Spot heal hard, and watch agro.  Your tanks will probably be rotating so a Defensive tank is on the flurries, so know which tank is up.<br />
<br />
other then that... debuff, nuke, heal, buff... as usual =)<br />
