I figure I can skip all of TBS and its faction grinds and head right into Tier 1 SoF zones, but wanted to know what were the TBS druid spells and which ones I should look into getting, if any.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I would look into getting both.  Rank 1 is from Pirate Faction, Rank II is from Katta faction.  The spells are level 72 and 73.<br />

The TBS Anti-Summoned nuke works on All Clockworks in SoF, which is nearly half the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 was basing my opinion on the pre-SoF content, which had a ridiculously small line-up of useful spots on which this spell could be used.<br />
 <br />
  on a seroius note, im happy to finally see this spell might actually get put inside one of my spell gems for once.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I didn't get 32k proc but I did get some nice crits and it is low cast time and low mana.</div></div><hr />

Nukes a summoned being and has a chance to debuff it (10%) and also make additional 32k damage (2%). Bought from Pirate / Katta merchants if you have enough faction.<br />

They've done a lot better job populating the lands with creatures that can be affected by this spell.</div></div><hr />

It is cheap as far as mana goes... and oh MY!! when you see that 32k hit it feels wonderful :) From the mobs I have used it on... 32k helps alot - these mobs have around 100k HP - and these are the trash mobs!!</div></div><hr />

The most mana efficient nuke (relative to other spells of its level) of any, especially when you factor in the negative adjust to resists for it.<br />

Back in the day I did a lot of leveling with that line in various locations.</div></div><hr />
