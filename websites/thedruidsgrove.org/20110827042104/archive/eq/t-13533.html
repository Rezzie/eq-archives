What's better for me to save up for, GM Cultural, or the armour you buy with Radiant Crystals? (Piece for piece I can compare but it's a question of how I can upgrade the two different types with augs).<br />

Can I only use augs bought with crystals, in armour bought with crystals, or can I also combine them with Cultural?<br />

Will upgrading from LDoN gear mean my old augs are just plain obsolete or is there any non-LDoN armour with the same slots?<br />

Losing clicky-root or mana pres from my current gear would pain me. Are there similar effects on Radiant Crystal armour or Cultural? If not, would all the extra mana and wisdom make up for it?<br />

GM Cultural, fully aug'd, has superior stats than DoN Crystal purchased armor fully aug'd. However, both those routes take a great deal of time. You may want to consider getting your armor from PoR Tier 1 (see note #2 below) and using your DoN crystals to buy augments instead.<br />
<br />
Can I only use augs bought with crystals, in armour bought with crystals, or can I also combine them with Cultural?<br />
Augments can be placed in any armor with the corresponding augment slot. They can also be removed from armor and put into new armor. You just need to buy a solvent from an NPC vendor (ranging in price from a few pp to 1kpp+).<br />
<br />
Will upgrading from LDoN gear mean my old augs are just plain obsolete or is there any non-LDoN armour with the same slots?<br />
I don't know the LDoN aug slots off hand, but the new armor uses aug slots 7,9 &amp; 12 most often.<br />
<br />
I believe there is a way to sell your LDoN pieces back for LDoN points. You might want to look into doing that and repurchasing different augs that would fit the newer armor. Anyone have a link on how to do that?<br />
<br />
Losing clicky-root or mana pres from my current gear would pain me. Are there similar effects on Radiant Crystal armour or Cultural? If not, would all the extra mana and wisdom make up for it?<br />
You can't buy clicky root, but almost all focus effects can be bought with Radiant Crystals. Check this site (http://plurpage.com/everquest/don.php) for a searchable list of augments.<br />
<br />
Two Notes Of Interest:<br />
<br />
1 - While you are earning Radiant Crystals, you can upgrade a few visible armor pieces and many non-visible pieces quickly an easily with Monster Missions. Check out this list (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=12277) which includes what missions have leather drops and non-visible slot rewards. The &quot;Revenge of Farsooth&quot; South Karana mission has a rare reward of an FT3 Ranged Slot item, as well.<br />
<br />
2 - Consider buying the PoR expansion. You can get into a pick up group in Arcstone to camp the diff named mobs that drop the quest item to turn in to get this level of armor:<br />
<br />

<br />
This is far quicker than DoN bought armor (and has superior stats) and far less time consuming than skilling up for GM Cultural made armor. Save your DoN crystals to buy focus effects and put them in this PoR armor. We're working on a complete list of the Tier 1 Arcstone druid armor here (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13376).<br />
<br />
Also, there are some quick quests in Arcstone and Relic you can finish with a pick up group that results in significant upgrades for you.<br />
<br />
Relic Shopkeeper's Earring <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO TRADE<br />
Slot: EAR<br />
AC: 18<br />
STR: +12 DEX: +6 STA: +13 CHA: +12 WIS: +14 INT: +14 AGI: +7 HP: +200 MANA: +190<br />

<br />
This comes from completing the Shopkeeper's Delight task starting in Relic with Shopkeeper Borso. The same NPC has another task, The Needy, that rewards:<br />
<br />
Relic Shopkeeper's Earring <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO TRADE<br />
Slot: EAR<br />
AC: 18<br />
STR: +12 DEX: +6 STA: +13 CHA: +12 WIS: +14 INT: +14 AGI: +7 HP: +200 MANA: +190<br />

<br />
Next to Borso, is Shopkeeper G'kil Zon. He gives out the Crossfire task that rewards:<br />
<br />
Relic Shopkeeper's Charm <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO TRADE AUGMENTATION<br />
Augmentation type: 7 8 <br />
Slot: FACE EAR NECK SHOULDERS BACK RANGE FINGER WAIST<br />

Class: ALL<br />

<br />
All three of these tasks can be completed with pick up groups. In fact, I see a lot of /ooc for group formation for these tasks on my server.<br />
<br />
Lastly, in PoR, there is an extremely simple delivery task that results in this:<br />
<br />
Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters <br />
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO TRADE<br />
Slot: BACK<br />
AC: 11<br />
STR: +13 DEX: +6 STA: +9 CHA: +13 WIS: +5 INT: +5 AGI: +8 HP: +165 MANA: +165<br />
SV FIRE: +13 SV DISEASE: +6 SV COLD: +11 SV MAGIC: +12 SV POISON: +13<br />
Recommended level of 70. Required level of 66.<br />
WT: 1.0 Size: SMALL<br />
Class: CLR DRU SHM NEC WIZ MAG ENC<br />
Race: ALL<br />
Slot 1, Type 7 <br />
<br />
It starts in the Elddar forest (I'll track down the NPCs name) and allyou have to do is deliver item he gives you to NPC in Plane of Growth. Thats it!<br />
<br />
A few more easy PoR quests with wonderful rewards are in this thread (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?p=195362#post195362). Since PoR is new, you will find it easy to get into pick up groups.<br />
<br />
I was in the same boat as you, being a non-raiding druid who took a break from the game. But a combination of Monster Missions, DoN Crystals and the new Prophecy of Ro expansion has helped me upgrade my equipment by leaps and bounds. Now if only I can replace my Elder Spiritist BP. :)</div></div><hr />

Wow! Thank you for your comprehensive reply. Certainly a lot of info to digest there. I'll definitely have to check out PoR and the MMs then.<br />
