<br />
Had in mind the tanking trinket, but not sure. Mainly because theres not so many trinkets/items with +def and HP regain.<br />

<br />
I do think that the Ony head rewards are a waste for a druid.  The trinket is nice, but there many other suitable trinkets for a tanking druid.  Mark of Tyranny, Smoking Heart, Force of Will.  <br />
<br />
Def is nice.  However, AC and dodge are probably most important for a druid tank (since we can't parry/block).</div></div><hr />

It helps with keeping aggro when I use it in MC/BWL tanking and is nice for when I have to DPS.  I remember reading that druids aren't affected by parry. The 7 health regen is nice but if youre tanking you will have a healer anyway.   8 defense is nice but why not get the might neck from MC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup, got eye of Hakkar wich imo is better, for that raw power. Got the DM neck thats almost as good as the MC neck, if Im thinking of the same as you do.<br />
<br />
thatnk you for the advices but I have to think about this some more :)<br />

<br />
Heck, both Mark of Tyranny and Smoking Heart is a better choice for a druid (both blues) than the onyxia trinket.<br />
<br />
Choose the neck if you don't have anything better is my advice. It is LEVELS better than the other stuff you get to choose from. :)</div></div><hr />

From what I know, a good chunk of druids plan to level to 70 in expansion feral and thats not too bad.</div></div><hr />

(15fr and 1% crit.. whow..) just go for the neck</div></div><hr />

(..and in hte former post I mean the ZG neck with +def and stam, not DM ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakiniku</div><div class="date">09-25-2006, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">+health don't works in combat<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure it does, much like mana/5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aedui</div><div class="date">09-26-2006, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Krain, that you've mixed HP regain from spirit, which dont work in combat.<br />
<br />
But how about that +def.. do we gain anything from that in feral form or is it yet another lost stat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">09-26-2006, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We do get help from +def items, there just aren't as many available to us as warriors, so our +def doesn't really keep up, also since we can't block or parry it really just lowers our chance to be critically hit, which it looks like we are getting as a feral talent in the expansion anyway.<br />
<br />
I have also read that health per 5 does not work in combat the way mp5 does.  I don't have a single piece of hp5 gear though, so I can't test it.  Warriors would probably be the ones to ask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cedre</div><div class="date">09-27-2006, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last time I checked, about 3 months ago, health regen from items or buffs (i.e. troll blood potions) worked in combat. You can turn on periodic effects in your combat window to check this.  However, the amount of health regen you can stack this way is still small compared to the DPS of any mob you would be fighting.  As a class that can heal themselves, you usually will gain more from an item that increases your health (directly or via stamina) than from an item with health regen. A +7 health regen item will heal you for a maximum of 84 points in a 1 minute combat. How many fights last 1 min?<br />
<br />
For a druid +Def reduces the number of critical hits.  It also possibly decreases crushing blows and increases your dodge rate if your defense skill is not maxed (level X 5).  You need +25 defense to reduce the chance of a critical hit by 1 percent.  A mob your level has a base 5 percent chance of critically hitting you. While +Def is not a useless stat, as a feral druid that usually fights in cat form, I would trade +8 Defense for +8 any other stat that is useful to a druid.  As a note, if you plan on tanking in the Molten Core (level 63 mobs) you will need a minimum of +300 defense to prevent critical hits.  See the Warrior forums or WoWWiki for the math.</div></div><hr />
