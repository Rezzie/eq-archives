She was just standing there and i told her to start spamming starfire.  Evidently she hadn't realised that BA makes all your spells instant cast, with a significant increase in damage, and she got several 3000 damage crits, a total of about 15000 damage in 10 seconds.

<br />
I can't believe I missed a Death Ray question, I gotta read harder!!<br />
<br />
The Death Ray can indeed hit for 4k in any gnomish engineer's hands.<br />
<br />
Death Ray will let you know how much damage it's gonna do by how hard the warm up damage does to you (for those that don't know, Death Ray is a 3 second cast iirc and hits the caster first while channeling).  If the warm up does 80'ish damage it's going to land for 700dmg and can do 250dmg a tick for a ray that's going to land for 2k damage.  Any of it's hits can be a crit... and the 2k crit = 4k damage.  It's just rare that it puts out a 2k blast and it's rarer yet that'll land as a crit.  Just FYI, I've never seen anything resist or partially resist a death ray.</div></div><hr />

Generally these fights are heavily stacked against the paladin, but, in the humble opinion of this little druid, he's one of the best pallies on my server..<br />
<br />
The duel began and he started beating on the hunter's pet while she shot him from range.  He got the pet to about 25% health then stopped attacking...  then a big blue lightning bolt leapt out as his deathray fired off, instakilling the pet.<br />
<br />
Then he ran over and started beating on the hunter.  The battle waged back and forth for about 5 minutes, until they were both on about 10% health and 0 mana.  The hunter got a wing clip off and the pally had no mana to free himself, it looked like she was going to win...  but then, at the last possible moment, the paladin threw a Dark Iron Bomb at her.<br />
<br />
BOOOOMM!&quot;!12 :D  duel over.<br />

I personally might have some buffing potions on (usually do) and people have called that cheap, but I wouldn't use a healing or mana one because I am cheap (don't want to waste the money).<br />
<br />
Same thing should hold for an engineer, they should be able to use gear they've made (rocket helms, death rays, etc...), but probably wouldn't want to waste bombs etc...<br />
<br />
not sure where I stand on the mechanical pets, would probably be legit to use them on a hunter or warlock, sort of tit for tat.</div></div><hr />

Beating everyone in duels and then doing /spit, doing his damndest to show off his gear, being generally unfriendly, egotistical, very unpleasant to be around.  If I looked up &quot;Arrogant&quot; on wikipedia, I'd half expect to find a picture of this hunter in the resulting article.  And so the noble paladin stepped up to the plate and handed the hunter's ass to him.  A classic case of watching someone getting exactly what they deserved, it was a beautiful sight to behold.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uvgrin</div><div class="date">03-01-2006, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest beef with engineering in duels is you have to specialize in engineering. You can wear most pieces made for cloth/leather, etc. There are not any self binded pots made for alchemy, so anyone can buy pots very even. So I have spent alot of time going up in alchemy, what advantage does this give me in a duel? Virtually zero, perhaps I might have some of the more exotic pots, but I can't use a pot for anything else other then myself. I think a self binded pots I can stun or sleep a foe would even the odds. So in terms of dueling to make it fair you can say you can use you're engineering stuff if you don't use pots and I use pots since I'm in alchemy.. but better engineering gear and you can use most pots only once every 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />

You just have to survive.  But as far as a duel goes, I don't understand why people find it necessary to pop a potion when they've obviously been outplayed and just can't accept the fact that someone got the better of them that day.  <br />
<br />
My level 40 warlock has only lost one duel and that was to a hunter who popped an invulnerability pot at the start of the duel, and then when I still managed to get him down to about 10% health by that time it had been about 2-3 minutes of me fearing him, seducing him, and killing off his pet and what do you know, he popped a health potion and obviously had enough to finish me off.  So I'm not sure if he just wanted to try out the potions effect on a duel, or if he really thought that the duel was fair.  So i respectfully /bow'd him and went on my way, keeping the anger inside.</div></div><hr />

Depending on what im fighting or how overgeared they are in a duel i may pop a mongoose and armor potion before we start mostly cause they arent going to kill me and heck getting the stuff for those is cake as for healing or mana pots during duels hell if they wanna waste the money let em, makes no matter to me im still going to get you in the end your just prolonging the agony</div></div><hr />

i got ganked outside everlook once (im a 60 moonkin) by a 51 rogue and a 58 warr(using invisibility pot, so i never saw him)..ended up killing em both hehe...then they got angry with me and chased me into everlook...and they got ganked by the guards! hahah world-pvp'ing at its best :)<br />

then a 60 troll mage decided to duel me..i was like sure buddy lets do this thang<br />
<br />
i remembered i had a health pot on me and a healthstone from a lock earlier...so i used em<br />
<br />
seems to me that whiners that lose should stay whiners....so i dueled him again without the stone and pots and kicked him again..lol<br />
<br />
he switched to his alliance alt and whispered me ..&quot;Why did u use a pot? Every1 knows that u cant ...&quot;<br />

I said &quot;Really i cant? seems i just did&quot;<br />
<br />
Im not trying to be rude or arrogant, its all fun...whatever advatages u have at ur disposal, i think u should be able to use<br />
<br />
in the same way ..i think an armorcrafter/weaponcrafter can use items they made..especially if they r bop items...r we really going to split hairs over this ? <br />
why should some people get to use items they make while other people cannot? ...just doesnt make sense...but i hear it a lot<br />

<br />
The reasoning being that you are wasting money in a situation where the outcome isn't really important (there is no down side of losing a duel).  Most people duel for practice, or to compare skill.  You are free to use potions against them, but they probably don't want to use the gold on just practice, so the advantage quickly shifts to the person willing to spend more to win and skill drops out of the equation.<br />
<br />
Not many still call it cheating, but it definitely defeats the purpose.  If winning is that important to you, drink away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Investment of time and money are the same thing, they are equivalent.<br />
<br />
If you get jumped in open world, by all means use pots to keep from dying, thats not what we were talking about.  Most duels are with the same faction, and winning isn't important as learning to handle different classes, etc...Now there is merit that people need to learn to deal with potters as well, but since the best counter strategy is to do it yourself, most people don't bother.<br />

A player is NEVER going to be as prepared to get in any other pvp situation besides a duel. A hunter setting up his stuff for fear beast to get a feral druid, or someone pulling out their deathray and putting away their other trinket before the duel to 2shot you. It's never like that in a battleground. You have to be ready for ANYTHING. But in a duel you know who you're fighting and you have all the time in the world to come up with a cheap strategy. A mage beating you in a duel doesn't mean that if he was on the other team and you saw him in a battleground he'd ever beat you there.<br />
<br />
So...nothing wrong with potions in battlegrounds and world pvp.....but I wouldn't duel anyone because duels aren't ever fair anyways, no matter how hard you try to make them that way. (Not to mention they'll start thinking that they're stronger than you if you lose...)</div></div><hr />

Totally agree. I rarely loose against a mage in duels because i trash my armor stuff and go all out resistance and equip both my reflectors (not shadow ofc).. i have like a 99% win against mages in duels.. but more like 50/50 in BG's.</div></div><hr />

More likely I'd see you running with the flag right to me while I am stealthed in moonkin form near your base, hibernate you, then blast you for a 1500pt SF followed immediately by a 500pt MF</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />

Highest is around 1950.  Am I wrong in assuming that people are getting these crits on clothies or people below level 60?  Highest that I've gotten on a clothie (sitting down) was around 1800.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

I would strongly urge against it however.  One of my best friends has a horde feral druid I run into in BGs from time to time, and we spar.  He has learned to avoid me.  Doesn't mean Balance is better than feral or anything overall, just in a one on one match up moonki has the edge.  I mean seriously, do you actually try to scratch the eyes out of other plate wearers?  Few good ferals bother when there are better softer targets around.<br />

if you really want to own me play a shaman or shadow priest.</div></div><hr />
