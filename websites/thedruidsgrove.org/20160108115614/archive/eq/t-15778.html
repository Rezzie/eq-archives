 <br />
I've recently leveled my druid up to 70 with 146 AA's.<br />
I'm decently bazaar equipped, but nothing special. I want to switch to my 47 SK as my main, but I have no clue where the fastest place to pl him to 60 will be. <br />
 <br />
I've heard a lot about shrouding, but never really done it before. So I really am unfamiliar with it.<br />
 <br />
So if anyone could take a few minutes to help me out i'd really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

Just pulled 3 or 4 mobs at a time and had them beat on the druids DS, used ensnare to pull and clicky root pants to keep them in place and beating on me.<br />
 <br />
Made sure I either did an AE with cleric or hit them a few times with hammer.<br />
 <br />
So long as Druid only does damage with DS then cleric gets exp.<br />
(Cleric and druid are NOT grouped)<br />
 <br />
Think I did this untill 51, have not yet taken the cleric any higher.</div></div><hr />
