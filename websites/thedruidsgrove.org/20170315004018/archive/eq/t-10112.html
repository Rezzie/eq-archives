I finally after playing Eq for about 4 years now have left my druid ..... for a lousy bard. I picked up The Bard's Tale and have been playing it and I must say it is quite good so far. It kinda plays like so far Baldur's Gate. But, the main exception is all the funny quips from the snarky Bard. The quips between the Narrator and the Bard are quite funny and amusing. For the players of the Bard's Tale 1 and 2 back in the days of the Commodore 64, Amiga, and systems like that will rejoice in this old classic turned new with a completely different storyline and mentioned several times in the game as well of the older games. Aside from some of the bad camera angles the Bard's Tale for PS2 seems like one of the best games on the market today just on the amusement factor of being a slightly dastardly kinda sorta but, not really hero. This is an at least rent the game and beat it game, so far I am getting my money's worth.</div></div><hr />

It's coming on PC, Yrys, but not until early next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the very first computer game I ever owned back on my Apple ][e.<br />
<br />
Hell, just earlier this year I booted up a windows cd version I found a few years back and played it.<br />
<br />
Bard's Tale, Wasteland (the inspiration for the eventual Fallout games), and the original SSI Gold Box Pool of Radiance were probably the three best CRPGs ever created.  While, obviously, they lacked graphical appeal...they (along with Wizardry which I never personally owned) were imo the impetus behind the computer RPGs which followed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">11-04-2004, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should have the PC version shortly sometime next year. Mostly, hack and slash but unlike Fallout, Baldur's Gate, Champions of Norrath of anyone ever tried them, uses the same engine and game style. The Bard's Tale has a really good entertaining storyline. Champion's of Norrath was to me like ehh.... so never really got into it.  I think players of the Commodore 64 era would really enjoy this one.</div></div><hr />

Muhaha... Death to druids !</div></div><hr />

<br />
The great thing about The Bard's Tale is, even though it contains every cliche known to MMOGs, it contains them purely to point out their ridiculousness.  Just about every event in the game is done tongue-in-cheek and a jab at every other RPG we've played.  It's a refreshing change, very entertaining, and extremely amusing.<br />
<br />
Unlike other RPGs, you don't start out as an unknown hero who is chosen by some unknown force to save the world.  The Bard, an arrogant and sarcastic man, has done and seen this all before.  He's traveled and rescued countless people and made a name for himself.  At this point, he's done the hero thing.  Now he's purely out there for &quot;coin and cleavage&quot; (as InXile says.)  He only does things if there's something in it for him.  He also seems to share a common perception with RPG players everywhere.  The cliches bother him nearly as much as they bother us, maybe even more so.  He's done it all before, so he complains, jokes, insults, etc. at nearly every turn.<br />
<br />
The Bard is clearly the star, but his sidekick is the narrator.  Picture an episode of &quot;George of the Jungle.&quot;  I'd swear they took cues from this show.  The narrator tells the Bard's story, in his own words, and often insults the Bard (which is usually directed at something you made the Bard do) at the same time.  The Bard hears all this and trades quips with him.  While the Bard is sarcastic, the narrator has a dry wit and his delivery is perfect.  Picture John Cleese.  He makes fun of the Bard, but doesn't break the narration role.  The narrator is really one of the features that makes the game.<br />
<br />
Just to give you an example of the humor, and I don't want to give too much away, the Bard kills a wolf and it's loot spills out.  Among the loot is food, candlesticks, chairs, pieces of armor, etc.  The narrator remarks something along the lines of, &quot;And after the Bard kills the wolves, he collects his spoils.  In addition to eating a full meal, it appears the wolf has ingested the dining room as well as an armory.  Wait a minute, am I reading this right?&quot;  The Bard replies, &quot;Yes, this stuff happens all the time.  Once I killed a rat and a treasure chest flew out of it!&quot;  The narrator than says how rediculous this is and he's just going to leave this part of the story out from now on, to which the Bard, constantly looking for coin, sighs and dejectedly claims that it's the best part.<br />
<br />
The one thing that will be a turn off for a lot of people is that The Bards Tale is an action RPG and not turn based.  Honestly, after years of Final Fantasy, I've come to prefer turn-based RPGs, but this game makes combat fun an innovative.  Basically, the Bard's combat is sort of similar to Baldur's Gate and Champions of Norrath.  One button hits; one button defends.  The complexity comes in the Bard's songs.  The Bard plays his lute and it summons someone to fight along side of him.  These can be utility songs (like the faerie that lights up rooms and sounds like Danny Devito), attack (archer), defense (bodyguard), and status effects (I think.)  However, you can't summon everything at once.  The Bard's lute can only play one song at a time, so you have to choose what's the best song to help you.  As you level, you can buy new instruments so you can have more than one song going at a time.  Songs take a few seconds to play, but then you can fight as normal with the minion fighting along with you until it dies.  I will point out that the AI is very good.  I can summon the Crone to heal me and know she'll keep me alive.<br />
<br />
Even the combat in this game has it's humor.  The Bard and his minions make comments during the fight and each song seems to be a stereotype you'd see in another RPG.  The Crone yells out, &quot;I put a spell on you!&quot; and &quot;HEEEAALLLSS!!&quot; randomly, for example.  After a while, this does become a little repetative, but the first few times did make me laugh.<br />
<br />
Overall, this game has surpassed my expectations.  The main thing that drew me to this game was the promised humor, and it has it.  From the wisecracking narrator to the oompaloompa Trows (I couldn't even explain this if I had to) to the beer song, I find myself constantly laughing and really having a great time with the game.  Sometimes I feel more like I'm watching a comedy than playing a game.  It is, quite possibly, the funniest game I've played.  If you like RPGs and you like comedy, this is the game for you.  InXile did a fantastic job.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Radlore</div><div class="date">01-06-2005, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember in the original you could save your party members individually - so you could pool all your party gold onto 1 character, save him, then pool it onto the next character and save him etc... When you loaded up the whole party again you had 6 times the gold :clap:  You could also duplicate items that way, but I'm guessing they fixed this 'little' bug hehe</div></div><hr />
