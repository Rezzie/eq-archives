Seems interesting, but, I wonder what exactly got condensed out that was extremely important to the ideals of the &quot;new world&quot;, as well as the portrayals of the not so happy things.<br />

edit... haha it had some little quiz on it it was silly, it was saying something like what is the most iconic image of america, a. Statue of Liberty, B Liberty Bell, C I forgot which.  The one that cracked me up was who was the best inventer, A. Ben Franklin. B. Thomas Edison C. Steve Jobs.....  Another one was something like what is the greatest moment of innovation..... I was wondering why the wheel was not on the list, but, sliced bread was.</div></div><hr />
