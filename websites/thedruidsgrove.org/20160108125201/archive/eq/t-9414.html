Are you still a die hard evocation nuker?  Are you a Tunarean at heart, specializing in the Alteration healing arts?  Are you that &quot;odd man out&quot; that spec'd in Abjuration?  Let us know!<br />
<br />
This poll is open for seven days and all votes are &lt;b&gt;public&lt;/b&gt;!  (Just don't want anyone being surprised by this :P)</div></div><hr />

BTW, if any are wondering why a ranger has been on your boards so much as of late, computer problems prevent me from playing EQ for a few weeks now, and this is the most civil of any of the class boards I can view (browser crashes when I visist some class sites)</div></div><hr />

I have been the main healer in group in Kod before, but that is only rare occasion.<br />
<br />
Sadly, if you think druid can be main healer in the high end game you are deadly wrong. Group needs a cleric, raid needs a ton of clerics. Druid need to heal m ore often in raid, but definitely not in exp group if you have a cleric.</div></div><hr />

I chose alteration knowing I'd nuke more, and wanting to nuke more.  However, a fizzled heal can wipe my group on a bad day.  There are times I'm the only healer, or my healing is essential.  A fizzled nuke or less mana pres reduces my dps, but is less likely to wipe the party.  <br />
<br />
And my best exp per hour is when I charm kite, so alteration all the way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are aware that there is no effective difference in fizzle rate caused by specialization, aren't you, for the majority of spells?  Spec 200 or Spec 100 or Spec 50 in Alt doesn't matter...you will have the same fizzle rate on your heal spells.<br />
<br />
The reason for that is that you likely already are at the base fizzle rate for those spells.<br />
<br />
Now, there are some spells with broken fizzle rates.  Having a spec will knock a few % off the fizzle rate for those spells.</div></div><hr />
