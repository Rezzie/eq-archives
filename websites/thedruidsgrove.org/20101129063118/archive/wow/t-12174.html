What partner would you recommend a feral duriod such as myself should group with for 2v2 arena?  Hunter maybe..?<br />

I'd go for a Paladin, or maybe a Warlock</div></div><hr />

The 2.3 patch is suppose to help them a bit with Arena, until then they are just dead meat.</div></div><hr />

You should really watch 'Fat Cow and the Pro' video.<br />

I find that feral druids go poorly with a pure healbot. Definitely go with another dps/hybrid class imo.</div></div><hr />

I hadn't thought about frost mage before, it sounds like a pretty good combo though - 2 classes, both with lots of survivability. :&gt;<br />

Do not run with a heal-spec'd class, as you won't have the individual DPS to take anything down.<br />

I've heard of ferals working well with Rogues, Ice Mages, and MS Warriors, and a few mentions of Shadow priests.</div></div><hr />

When I was feral spec'ed I've 2v2ed with Rogues, MS warriors and a couple weeks with Ice mages. All were really fun. I've yet to try a Feral druid/shadow priest combo.<br />
<br />
I think the most fun was Ice mage because how much I adore the Fat Cow and the Pro video and it's not as popular from what I feel in the 2s bracket. It's really interesting to play.</div></div><hr />

Whenever he was taking too much damage, i could shift and heal him. Whenever i was taking too much damage, well, he MS them while i was in bear form.<br />
<br />
I am still a noob in arena, but the changes to shifting should make me much more badass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
we got stomped royaly many times.<br />
<br />
best 2v2 for me was feral druid, feral druid.... we both stealth pounced 1 target when pounce wore off the first to attack would finish the full pounce .. rake.. yadaa yaddaa and when the other pounced, the first would &quot;hopefuly&quot; cycle the other target and first targets dead before 2nd mpunce is worn off</div></div><hr />

At our level we do much better with his balance druid because of the initial stealth attack and many forms of CC such as cyclone, bash, root, maim ...  We usually attack with the treants which breaks most traps and sometimes forces the opposite stealthed partner to come out and then I attack.  <br />
<br />
On most of the time we lose is because I forget to move out of cat form ... but with any of the 3 combination I think your team can do well.  Being a druid provides as with many tools in a 2v2 setting just need to remember to use them ... LOL</div></div><hr />
