We have trioed it at 75 down to 22mins but I am guessing 69 unless you bring friends you can do it but take your time and snare/egress pull.<br />
 <br />
69.1 yields a 20hp/m Mana regen 2 aug if your not capped as cursor reward....also on hard yield nice mask upgrade your current one.....dodh tasks.<br />
 <br />
Thinking since your on pvp is why you have resist augs versus mana hps in some spots?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Besides Breakdown in Communication quest augs, what is the &quot;best&quot; type 7 aug?  I would assume there are probably a couple answers to this question, so I will try to be more specific...<br />
 <br />
Are there any type 7 augs with more hp/mana than Frostflake of the All-Enduring from FC (120 hp/mana/end)?<br />
 <br />
Are there any type 7's with an abnormally high amount of additional modifiers and/or effects on them?<br />
 <br />
Are there any type 7's that seem to be well rounded items in their own right? (Dain aug falls in this category, but just wondering if there are any others)<br />
 <br />
I have a chest item with a type 7 slot that I dont see myself wanting to replace even when all other items are type 8, so just wondering what my best option to minimalize stat loss would be.<br />
 <br />
I currently use Dain mm aug, which has beautiful stats for its difficulty to attain imo, but I do not like the inability to link stats to friends that it shares with the Breakdown in Communication augs.<br />
 <br />
Appreciate any help you guys can offer, and hopefully it answers a question you had Dalinia, if not, sorry for using your thread instead of starting a new one.  Thanks)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 65/65 augment is a rare drop, so it may take a dozen missions or more to get depending on the RNG.<br />
<br />
The mission should be pretty easy in a group at 69, just not as fast as it is at 75. The mobs are 68ish (named mobs are 70), hit for 550 (?), don't summon and are fully slowable. It's an outdoors zone, so mounts work and level appropriate Harmony should work too. Make sure to get rid of the pets before you charge the ghost or else you may be fighting the whole sub-basement.<br />
<br />
Solo-wise, well, a level 69 (70+ by now, I assume) Druid should be able to kill any single mob in the zone except perhaps for the CHers. If you could get the 3 named mobs to the zone line by themselves, you would probably kill them quickly, loot and scoot. However, even with snare/root/egress/IVU potions, I can't think of a way to get the ghost out of the basement single and if you have to kill your way down there, well, you will be 75 before you are done :-\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">02-19-2007, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is +100hp/mana type 7 from Anshengate (trash drop). I don't remember the name and cannot check my magelo from work, but I have it on my BP so feel free to check my magelo below :)<br />
 <br />
Edit: I checked, it's Hardened Coalstone of Purity +100 hps and mana, +20 SV Corruption, +6 spell shield. Type 7, slot chest/legs. There also drops similar to melee classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lujayne</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a 3  monster mission arc regarding Venril Sathir's rise to power that begins in the Emerald Jungle.  The NPC to begin the missions is Tulok (an Iksar) who spawns in the NW corner of the zone (where the tainter gorrilla and Serverillous spawn). All the augs are type 7/8.<br />
<br />
First mission has common reward for 20ac 30mana aug<br />
<br />
Second mission has common reward for 65hp / mana aug (similar to unrest)<br />
.<br />
Third mission (which starts in Trak's Teeth) has common rewards of 65hp / 75 mana aug or 75hp / 65 mana aug both of which have small resists to them.<br />
<br />
There's also that nice random drop one from DSK with the beneficial range (Ikaav Gaze).  It's called Ancient Eggshell Fragment or something.</div></div><hr />
