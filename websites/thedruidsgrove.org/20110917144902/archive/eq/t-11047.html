In Order of Highest to lowest:<br />
 <br />
The Relentless:  Anguish Level, Txevu, Time<br />
Cohort:  Txevu Level, Time<br />
The Stone Coven:  Inktu'Ta, should win on next attempt, boss at 27 percent last time. Time<br />

Hellfire Club:  Elementals, have killed Fennin Ro, Artiber<br />
Praxium:  Fennin Ro<br />

<br />
Silent Redemption is our top guild. They are backflagging for Anguish and Txevu now.<br />
<br />
Watchers is Qvic/Time.<br />
<br />
Sojo is Time/Ikkinz (soon Uqua, I think). Dari can speak more specifically about Sojo.<br />
<br />
Alarius is raiding Inku'Ta to prep for Txevu.<br />
<br />
Mythic Voyagers is vaguely Elemental. Not sure if they still do VT.<br />
<br />
Exemplar is nowhere near Time. They are not a raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Endeavor is dead.<br />
<br />
Our Qvic active guilds are: Watchers, Alarius, and sometimes SR.<br />
<br />
See you all soon!<br />

Technically we do have one at http://cazic-thule.net/forums/ although I am not overly proud of it. Doesn't seem to have too much to do with EQ anymore. Please don't prejudge our server by some of the crapola you see there.<br />
<br />
CT is a pretty cool place. Everyone for the most part gets along and there's very few altrications between guilds.<br />
<br />
While I am truly sorry that you Brell folks must endure this change, I think you will find it a pretty laid back server. It is however about to become pretty darn busy.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the added people will spark up some guild competition and breathe some life back into the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

Qvic was on rotation breifly between CC and TSC, tho we where told the rotation ended.  It'll probly start back up again however becuase now IoA is there for spawns as well.<br />

Apparently it was only CC and TSC in the rotation and TSC asked to ditch it a couple weeks ago.  So, you are right.  Qvic is a FFA at the moment.  But, with IOA and all the brell guilds coming in, that will probably change.</div></div><hr />

I think you'll find most on cazic pretty receptive to that.  Even with the rivalry of the high end guilds the Cazic community tries to limit the headaches.  Naturally, there are always a few notable individuals, but, there's no real conflict going on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">03-30-2005, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is unlikely Qvic will stay on any kind of rotation - public or private. Brell is a FCFS server and is not receptive to a rotation system outside of Time and Vex Thal. Both zones are easily negotiated.</div></div><hr />

I expect compromise from Cazic and Brell guilds.  FFA is fine when you only have 4 guilds there, but there will be 8 or 9 after the merger.</div></div><hr />

I can say this, we will never enter a rotation on Qvic, and we won't hesitate to kill them if we have nothing else to do (but that has happened like 2x in the past month so we don't do it too frequently).  And right now, we have a standing turn in Time, the first weekend of each month we pick one day and do it.  So we take basically 1 day a month.</div></div><hr />

We won't have 8 or 9 guilds in Qvic after the merger. If anything it means that more will be in Inku'Ta as I expect Cynosure will be down more often.</div></div><hr />

I appreciate the kind words from CT. I've been a bit apprehensive about this move. My husband, Aathanor, has been a bit more positive and uplifting-saying it will breathe new life into the game for many people. I must admit, when I first saw the CTC board I was rather skeptical. Good to know that it seems that's more like our Brell Rants board  :newburn: <br />
<br />
I guess I'll see you CT druids next week!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-31-2005, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, I doubt most of the server even knows about the CTC.  Its pretty much useless.<br />
 <br />
Most guilds, from my experiance, stay to their guild boards and their class sites.  We've not  had a decent server board in like.. 4 or 5 years.<br />
 <br />
Being as there's not a whole lot we can do about the merger, I've just basically accepted it for what it is.  I think I may meet some new friends, stand a chance of losing some old ones to server moves, but I plan on sticking around and watching the power shift.<br />

If any of you Brell Druids have questions on how things on CT usually are, feel free to send a tell and I'll try to answer ya best as I can.<br />
