I am currently switching back and forth between a Dark Ember, and a Garou Bone Club.  I know that I should have gotten rid of these long ago, but I just have not found the best piece for the price, or something to quest for. :frocket: <br />

Your help is appreciated!</div></div><hr />

How ever if u can't because of what ever reasons there maybe<br />
<br />
i would reccomend a soulstripper or something similar im not sure there price now really on pvp server there 3-5k and on bristlebane there 2-3k so who knows how ever its a decent 1hb with a lifetap proc on it which might be handy if u want to melee a little bit</div></div><hr />

I am to the point where I need to fix my Art Keepers faction.  I wil keep my eye out for a Soulstripper though.</div></div><hr />
