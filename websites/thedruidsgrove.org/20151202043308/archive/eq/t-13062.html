 <br />
Guild planning BL epic kill which is in the same room as Cracked Earthshaker. Quick questions for you:<br />
 <br />
1-If I am there, will I spawn Cracked Earthshaker if I've got the aerated pot shell but NOT the Juggernot blood (curious to what actually spawns Earthshaker)? I do not have the clear mind crystal, obviously. I'm at the point right now where I do have the bowl of foul smelling liquid, just need the energized noc blood from Natimbi event. Guess the question there is--can the last 3 fights be done in any order?<br />
 <br />
2-Say by chance I do have the Noc Juggernaut done and have my clear mind crystal and we all zip away to RCoD--is the druid fight to be done before Beastlord epic fight? (I believe I've read that the druid must be done first).<br />
 <br />
3-Is it correct that the Reborns in Natimbi are now non-snare/non-mezzable?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance, your help and insight are invaluable!!</div></div><hr />

It is really first-come-first-serve, ie. whomever - Druid or Beastlord - that is up to that step can spawn it first upon zone-in. They can't be up both up at the same time. Once spawned whichever it is, Earthshaker or Dark Animalist, stays up for a short-ish amount of time and despawns if not killed. There is a wait between re-spawning - like most epic things I would guess a 2 hour wait - but not sure.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The Druid Earthshaker event is a zone triggered event. When the druid with the required pieces zones in the earthshaker is spawned.<br />
 <br />
IF you have the &quot;clear mind crystal&quot; and zone into rcod you will spawn the earthshaker (IF the spawn timer allows). <br />
IF you are ready and have the force to take the Dark Animalist it would be silly of the guild to not send you back to the nearest bank to get your &quot;clear mind crystal&quot; while they move into the hall before the Earthshaker room and take him with the same force. <br />
Best of luck<br />
 <br />
*edit* any raid force that can take the Dark Animalist can and should also be able to do the Earthshaker and the final fight for your 1.5 if they are looking for targets.</div></div><hr />

Unless this has changed recently, the Earthshaker does not spawn until you enter the Hallway leading down to the Zun'Muram.  <br />
<br />
Once inside that building / hallway however, if you have the Clear Mind Crystal, it will trigger.<br />

I do not wish you to risk my raid on something that could would or should work. (this indicates a proven belief that SoE can and will screw up programming for something [creator respawn for example])<br />
 <br />
As a druid port to GF get it out of the bank and then come back into zone and catch up to the raid... this will give me time to get everyone in place and be ready to clear the stationary mobs from the Earthshakers room so the raid can follow the MT down into the room and kick his ass :)<br />
 <br />
Why take chances with something that is easy to prevent?</div></div><hr />

This used to be bugged - I am not sure if it was fixed.  If you are flagged for that part, you will trigger the Earthshaker, crystal on you or not.  The Qinimi encounter for the 2.0 also had this issue.<br />

 <br />
There is a flaw, from my view in that chain of events.<br />
<br />
Your raid would need to clear into the building reguardless.  If the Druid triggers the fight, becuase its proximity based - you can simply do that first.  Futhermore, unless this was also fixed, the Earthshaker will clear his room for you.  Since the Beastlord Event is triggered via a turn-in, this would be the more logical choice.<br />
<br />
Since I am going to assume you setup in the downward hallway prior to the room, rather then in the room itself - I really don't see how your raid is at risk (becuase the mobs would not be spawning on you in any event).<br />
<br />
Of course, unless something has changed and he now has the Clear Mind Crytsal, this entire debate is fairly pointless.<br />

 <br />
Actually there is no clear into this fight required at all.<br />
1) Gather at the rcod zoneline (inside rcod)<br />
2) Buff up (or in this case other than the dead from the BL epic everyone should be raid buffed)<br />
3) Have a mage drop his invisibility stones (5 use fixed duration invis items)[anyone not using fixed duration invis will be rezed after the raid]<br />
4) Move as a group invis to the top of the stairway before the room that the Earthshaker spawns in. (you are safe from wanderers if the raid stays on the Earthshaker side of the line on the floor)<br />
5) JUST before the druid enters the zone (have them standing in Bloodfields) pull the mobs in the room. Your choice for this I had the pleasure of using a bard (no monks available to me)<br />
6) Druid zones in and makes their way to the raid.<br />
6a) Sometime in here the Earthshaker should spawn<br />
7) MT moves down and engages Earthshaker.<br />
8) Raid follows MT<br />
9) Earthshaker will cast an aoe FD <br />
10) Raidleader will call &quot;Stand UP&quot; everytime the proc goes off.<br />
11) This fight is just a dps fight and I have never had a death doing it my way and done with 18-28 people elemental geared.<br />
12) Druid loots the item from Earthshakers beaten corpse<br />
13) Raid leader loots the chest (item should be attunable)<br />
14) Raid moves back up out of the room to the top of the stairs for loot award and to avoid respawn.<br />
 <br />
Earthshaker will clear his room for you<br />
The normal spawns in the room are not cleared by Earthshaker. The good news is Earthshaker is tethered and the mobs can be pulled to the raid at the top of the stairs with Earthshaker adding and being pulled back to his spawnpoint doing no damage and having no effect on the raid.<br />
 <br />
I really don't see how your raid is at risk<br />
The only way the raid would be at risk in this case is for the Possiblity of the Earthshaker spawning while dealing with the Dark Animalist and his pets at the rcod tunnel entrance. <br />
I do not know if Earthshaker and DA can be up at the same time, but it is a possiblity I would not like to deal with.<br />
The timing on the Earthshaker being up after spawn is unknown. I personally would not like to risk him spawning while dealing with the BL epic final fight as that one is a true pita.<br />
The time to rez and rebuff (after the DA fight) for moving to the setup point for the Earthshaker MAY mean that the Earthshaker has despawned leaving your raid without the secondary in zone target. I would much rather as a Raid leader have the knowledge the mobs I'm after WILL be up when &quot;I&quot; choose so things can go according to plan. <br />
Having the druid port out to pick up the items required to spawn the Earthshaker takes very little time, hurts nothing, and is just cautious. <br />
Being cautious might seem silly but I would rather know I will win than risk having 2 epic mobs spawn and have one despawn before I was ready. <br />
 <br />
If someone is at this stage of their epic they can zone into RCOD and move towards the location of the Earthshaker zone to find out when they get the Emote with someone watching the room, I actually wouldn't mind finding out when he does spawn.<br />
Tried it last night and got the emote and him spawning as I entered the final corridor to his room<br />
 <br />
**Edited to add info on Earthshaker AOE**<br />
The aoe is<br />
760DD, Stun, FD, knockback<br />
<br />
Levitation is manditory.<br />
Positioning of the mob is important. Get the MT to back against the wall so when the aoe goes off he's still in agro range of the Earthshaker.<br />
Having someone spam &quot;stand up&quot; in /rs is a usefull tool to get your dps and healers back in quickly.<br />
IF you have group healers available and AA Wards plan on having them set so everyone knows where they are to be in range for healing the DD<br />
IF there are no other major raids that need you might want to try using Infusion of the Faithful (vet AA) to see if it will help you avoid the AoE. (I can not remember if this helped or not sorry)</div></div><hr />

Who was there what kind of raid force?<br />
Inquiring minds want to know :)<br />
I'm sorry it didn't work for you last night but he will go down for you <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">djinnie</div><div class="date">01-11-2006, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had maybe 4/5 grp's but were a little short on healers (As a guild we have just started to work on Ele planes) <br />
His AE is not something we have come across before and we fell pretty much to it with aggro changes and loosing healers straight away.<br />
<br />
Once I had spawned him we waited a few mins for room to be cleared but didnt seem to be happening.  After 3 mins we organised for chanters to lock down an add each (3 mobs) and then raid charged the earthshaker. Once we settled into place, we had 3 healers left and a couple of tanks we had him worried.  Got him to 45% but the mezzes started dropping, as did the chanters and that was the end.<br />
<br />
Next attempt we will clear adds before I move in.  Everyone has an understanding for the effect now so should be alot easier.<br />
<br />
The hotkey for 'Raid Stand Up' is something i will be using too, good tip :)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

In the last 3 times I was involved in this raid there were No MGB heals required if that's a consideration for your raid leaders.<br />
