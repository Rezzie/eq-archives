<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keggie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just before PoP came out I stoped playing EQ.  I recently sarted playing again am I am lvl 63.  I used to love charm kiting.  That was my primary means of exp/aa pre PoP.  I spent most of my time in Chardok, ME, WW, you name it i charmed it.  Anyway it seems that charming is the main means of exp now post 60 in PoP.  I have heard a lot about the frogs in PoS and I was wondering if anyone could give me any information or tips.  As a side note i assume i need to get my level 63 charm spell to do this...i do not have this yet but hopefully ill pick it up soon.<br />
<br />
What i was wondering is..<br />
     1.  What animals are best to use as pets in PoS?<br />
     2.  Do you then ushually keep that pet charmed/hasted/buffed or do you let him get beat down to 10%, break charm, and find another pet?<br />
     3.  If you do keep teh same pet for a long time what are the best animals to fight for exp?<br />
     4.  And of course any extra tips people want to add would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In general I usually keep a single pet hasted/buffed most of the time since it's generally a bit of a pain to find a new pet.  The one exception would be the nightstalkers in PoN (heavily camped 5 months ago, no idea how it is now).  I suppose if you have CoT you could rotate pets more freely in disease as you'll never have a problem with getting all uncharmable rats.<br />
<br />
Animals I've charmed...<br />
Plane of Nightmare: ravens (double for 248?  Some are too high for CoK), nightstalkers (double for low 200's, always CoK-able, unsure if they'll equip weapons).  10k-12k hp or so.  There are some dire charmable ravens (I forget the name) which double in the 150's.<br />
<br />
Plane of Disease: rats.  I forget the order as far as which rats are stronger than others, but swamp rats and pestilent rats make the best pets but are sometimes too high for CoK.  Weaker rats double for 248 or so I think, stronger CoK-able rats double for 286.  12k or so hp.<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice: rats make great dire charmed pets.  Quad in the 150's I think, if given weapons.  8k-10k hp?<br />
<br />
Plane of Storms: Loroks are level 60 (CoT required) and triple for 581 to 636.  Roughly 20k hp.  Amazing pets, though occasionally you find one that is a bit more magic resistant than others.  Highly contested though...7 spawn every 24 minutes.  There's also a gruezok cub that can be dire charmed, which hits in the 150's or so (not sure if it'll equip weapons).  Nearly everything in the zone summons, so unless no one is killing loroks, you'll probably have to use the pet to kill summoners in a small group.<br />
<br />
Plane of Valor: A Gamite Frog and a tree frog can both be charmed with CoT; they both double (triple?) in the high 400's to 500's and have around 20k hp.  Most are unsnareable though, so you'll be doing a lot of egressing if you use them as pets unless grouped with someone that can mez.  If you find a snareable one you can do quite well killing other snareable mobs, though I've had problems with my pet warping to spawn point and getting killed, training me.  There's also &quot;a small tree frog&quot; which is dire charmable, doubles in the 150's and has the usual 8k or so hp.<br />
<br />
Plane of Tactics: Haven't tried charming here yet.  I've heard there's a level 58 Decorous Boar (for CoT) which hits in the 300's, a level 53 boar for CoK, and I think a dire charmable boar.  Enchanters do much better with charm here, though, as very little summons, and many mobs are in the 61-64 level range.<br />
<br />
Crypt of Decay: Cute little dire charmable rat.  (The rest of the rats are not flagged as animals.../boggle)  Quads in the 150's or so if given weapons, and seems to have the usual 8k or so hp.</div></div><hr />
