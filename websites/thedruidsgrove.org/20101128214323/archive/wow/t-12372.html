Just hit 69 and getting ready for PvP at level 70. I'm a Feral spec and plan to PvP a lot (Arena, BG's, World PvP) but also be available to run instances and tank if necessary.<br />
<br />
Maybe that's a pipe dream and I need to focus on either Kitty DPS or Bear Tanking; and if so I choose Kitty DPS.<br />
<br />
To either end, here's my spec for reference -  <br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0zZxGMsfroeuioVxhz<br />
<br />
- and I'm having one debate currently.<br />
<br />
Could I solicit opinions on whether 5 points in Imp. Mark of the Wild will get me more overall traction (in terms of benefit to those I buff in PvP, benefit to myself via increased armor, increased Agi, Str, Sta, and resists..etc.) than 3 in Survival of the Fittest and 2 in Imp. Leader of the Pack?<br />
<br />
I haven't crunched the numbers too hard but Imp. LotP seems to be more towards PvE / Raiding than PvP, and is Survival of the Fittest even necessary considering the much more minimal stat increase than Imp. MotW and that at a certain resilience rating I won't need the reduction in critical hit % possibly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my debate. And in case anyone wonders, I figured I didn't need Furor and Intensity. Intensity only works when I pop Enrage in Bear form while Furor is a constant energy / rage generator that couples well with Natural Shape Shifter IMHO.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great forum and I look forward to any constructive feedback.<br />

<br />
You will give far more benefit to melee based groups and to yourself with  SoF and Imp.LoP. There is no debate on that one. The crit, healing and survival to you is massive.<br />
<br />
SoF is about 3% crit immue which is a lot of resilence.<br />
<br />
Furor is totally necessary for pvp. Insensity is a matter of choice, Vs Shapeshifter. I wish I could have both but I choose Intensity for the Rage and Mana regen - I OT as well in high end instances where I need to be gaining Agro really quickly and I love smacking peeps with Maul, Mangle, shred combos in PvP. --- Just addicted to a healthy Rage bar in PvP.<br />
<br />
Overall you have a smart looking talent spread in that link.<br />
<br />
peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">02-03-2008, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. That talent spec is pretty standard feral PvP. The only debatable issue is Intensity VS Natural Shapeshifter, with Elymanrock already pointed out. And IMO? Natural Shapeshifter is more important for PvP. So. GO YOU.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archiee</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone heard of that resto druid/feral druid 2v2 combo doing extreamly well in arenas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">02-04-2008, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. Thanks for the responses. And the one attempted hi-jacking! :axe: <br />
<br />
So first off, Intensity reads as if it only regens mana WHILE casting. And since I'll primarily be in animal form and I juggle my forms quite a bit, I can't see Intensity in any way replacing Natural Shape Shifter. I could see it if it increased mana regen over all but it's only 10% WHILE casting. So unless I'm missing something, it seems fairly benign for a Feral spec and it's interesting they would stack an Enrage buff with it...<br />
<br />
I'm going to try moving the 5/5 from Imp. MotW to Imp. LotP and SotF. I had thought that the point of resilience was to become &quot;uncrittable&quot; which would negate SotF eventually...but maybe that's only in PvE vs. know quantities? In PvP, it would seem your opponents Hit or Spell Hit values could necessitate one needing higher resilience or less chance of being crit. So I'll try it as recommended and see how it feels.<br />
<br />
Thanks again! Appreciate the feedback.<br />

Outside of casting (meaning outside the &quot;5 second rule&quot;) already benefits from full +spirit regen, Intensity does nothing to help boost that further.<br />
<br />
It is, however, a nice feral PvE talent for extra DPS and it helps a bit for those times when as a Feral you might help heal (in which case you'll probably be within the 5SR the whole time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Intesity's kinda a playstyle thing.  Not necessary at all.  Personally I love it for the few times I get asked to heal, plus the rage part's just a bonus, I've gotten used to it, so I grab it in my usual PvE only build.<br />
<br />
If I had to do a PvP build I'd drop it for sure, Natural Shapeshifter is awesome for PvP.</div></div><hr />
