I had a lot of interest in it a while back but haven't followed it for many months.  I just got an e-mail telling me it went live.  The only review I could find was this player review. (http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/darkandlight/player_review.html?id=321792)  It doesn't look good at all for this game.</div></div><hr />

Horrible reviews, sounds to me like they ran out of development money and pushed the game out, hoping to get whatever money back they could, at the expense of the gamers.</div></div><hr />
