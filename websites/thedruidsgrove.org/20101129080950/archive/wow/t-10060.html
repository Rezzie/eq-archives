I know that you're supposed to (in theory) be able to get the quest chain started by speaking to Aristan Mottar outside the Stormwind Bank, then:<br />
<br />
 Buying perfume/cologne<br />
 Applying said scent<br />
 Waiting for a heart to appear above one of the Stormwind Guards<br />
 Right click as though asking for directions<br />
 At the bottom of the list there is an option to take a package... when you do so, it may or may not contain a Guard's Card.<br />
 Repeat until you get a card<br />
 Take it back to the originator of the quest, Aristan Mottar.<br />
<br />
However... once I get the quest, I can never get the option for the package. Help? Am I doing something wrong here? Most people are just as clueless, or else they're not giving away their secret.</div></div><hr />

You have to keep hitting up guards ( I ended up putting on perfume when it worked, and I'm a guy in game , and and out of...anyways ) as there seems to be some kind of cool down time between when the last person gave them a love gift or whatever and when the next person can.<br />
<br />
It took me about an hour to get the flippin card, then a lot of running around findind some guy in Hillsbrad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vallista</div><div class="date">02-12-2006, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, did the quest; also did the whole assembly of the Alliance (because I'm a NE) gift package... it's no surprise that the NE's are winning in the whole Valentine's Day thing. (If I never hear another tinkly 'twinkle-iiiinnnnggg' and see another shower of rose petals... anyway...)<br />
<br />
I have now figured out the quest, thanks to people who posted-- especially about the cooldown. Now it seems like some of the previously non-working guards will actually work the quest now. <br />
<br />
I now have a snazzy red dress to go with my snazzy purple dress.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what to do with the used friendship bracelets?</div></div><hr />

But apparently I quit too soon. Just got a box of chocolates (whoopee). Would have loved the red dress!<br />
<br />
The only thing I hate about being a night elf is the earthtones. Does anybody know what course to take to get really good outfits? I prefer apricot/teal on black ... the kind of colors you see on the hippogryphs' wings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Robes of Arugal from Shadowfang Keep look pretty awesome imho..  It also depends what sort of stats you're looking for.<br />
