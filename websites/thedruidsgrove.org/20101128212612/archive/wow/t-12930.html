<br />
And there's some info on Bash acting as an interrupt there as well, even if the target can't be stunned. <br />
<br />
Do you think the quest chain will still be available for those of us who want to try to go through and do it the old fashioned way?<br />
<br />
I think I would be sad.  I've been looking forward to this quest chain since I got to outlands.  Maybe I'm just a little masochistic, but it sounds like fun!</div></div><hr />

If you partner up with another druid who is also on the chain, it's quite fun.<br />
<br />
Also, considering most Druids are practically bankrupt after paying for Swift Flight Form, the quest chain offers quite a bit of gold for your efforts.<br />
<br />
However, I can't imagine there will be a lot of people wanting to do it the old fashioned way.....so kudos to you for wanting to take the &quot;scenic route&quot;.  :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

We'll probably do the chain together once we're both wealthy enough.  It's kind of one of those &quot;experiences&quot; you can only get from being a druid.  I'm excited about it, and I think he is too.<br />
<br />
Similar to the quests to get bear form and aquatic form.  It's a Druid's only adventure.  <br />
<br />
I'm going to work my little fuzzy butt off to get the gold together so I can go on the quest chain.  I have a LOT of gold to get in a very short amount of time it seems!<br />
<br />
I think I may already be honored with Lower City.  I'll have to check when I log in.  I know for a fact our guild leaders are, and the guild I'm in...if there is a &quot;rite of passage&quot; that they can help someone with, they always do.<br />
<br />
We recently helped get my husband's Warlock through Scholo and Dire Maul for his Epic mount.  Well worth it!  That mount is gorgeous (in an evil, shadowy, fiery kind of way!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-21-2008, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honored is pretty easy to get for most factions if you have done the quests in that area, or run the pre-70 instances once.<br />
 <br />
 Well worth it! That mount is gorgeous (in an evil, shadowy, fiery kind of way!)<br />
 <br />
hehe, I love that mount on my Warlock too :)<br />
 <br />
I read in those same patch notes that they are making the Warlock (and Pally) epic ground mounts trainable at 61.  I'm still glad that I did the quest line for mine... it was fun, and I feel like I earned that demon.<br />
 <br />
I still haven't pulled together the 5k gold on my Druid, but once I do I plan on doing the quest as well.  &lt;3 class specific quests ^^</div></div><hr />

I thought my husband and I were the only ones.  I did talk to our guild's resto druid about it last night, and she said that, while the quest chain is a pain, it's still a Druid's Only thing, and is a big part of the fun for being a druid.  So I'm all in.  Going for it.  Just...trying...to grind the gold...ARGH!</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lvl 71 you can't fly (in Northrend)!  So, you might as well wait until lvl 76/77 (don't recall the exact level) before you even bother to pay for the training.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But you'd still want to be able to fly in Outlands, I'd imagine for whatever Dailies you might still want to do or for farming herbs/mining etc.<br />
<br />
Would you not?<br />
<br />
I thought I had heard 78 was the level for flight in Northrend...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">True, but you will most likely reach lvl 71 while in Northrend leveling toward 80, so why would you go back to the Outlands?  You still have regular flight form.<br />
<br />
I'm just pointing out that you have little use for any type of flight form at lvl 71 so there is no need/hurry to obtain epic flight form at 71 when you can't really use it until 77.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol Thanks Oiysters!  <br />
<br />
I'm not in a huge rush for it, and I understand what you're saying TLBJ.  But it's more about the experience for me.  I realize I won't be able to use it in Northrend until 78 (which makes little sense as to why you're able to learn it at a trainer at 71, but who am I to say?)<br />
<br />
I am sure, being in a helper guild, that I'll spend a decent amount of time assisting in Outlands on group quests with our up and coming 70's, even post-expansion.<br />
<br />
IMO, it's a Rite of Passage for a druid to get Epic Flight form.  So many are going to bypass the quest chain now because it'll be easily available by Trainer.  It's more about the experience of being a druid for me.  Not so much about flying around Outlands.  <br />
<br />
But my husband hated me for the longest time when I first started, because I'd refuse to abandon a quest chain if I thought the &quot;storyline&quot; was worth seeing it through.  We each enjoy different things about the game.  Doing &quot;druid only&quot; things on my beloved Druid makes me a happy bear.<br />
<br />
Tlbj, I'm convinced you need more /hug!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda odd that they made it 71, but now that I think about it I guess it's to make sure that epic flight form isn't ez-mode for people who don't buy the expo.  I still fully plan (as soon as I can gather up 5k gold on my Druid ugh) to do the quest line. Gonna be a lot harder to find people to go back to do a heroic lv 70 instance, but meh, I'm sure some people will be up for it. <br />
 <br />
I am forcing myself atm to do the Isle of QQ dailies on my warrior and warlock until the expo comes out in mid November. Hopefully combined I'll have 5k so I can get my lock his epic flyer. I need to transfer my Druid to a new server that I know people on ...<br />
 <br />
I think that I'd spend more time in Outland if Northrend wasn't in the 'Old World'. I'm sure a majority of my time gathering will be spent in Northrend. I never herb or mine in Azeroth anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">10-22-2008, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still pick up herbs and whatnot in Azeroth for guildies or the AH.  I would like to have the ability to fly quickly through Outlands to farm herbs if need be.  I don't know.  Like I said, for me, it's more of a Rite of Passage sort of thing.<br />

DO warlocks get an epic flight mount that's specific to their class?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
No.  I wish.  Would make sense.  <br />
 <br />
I definitley agree that you should do the quest as soon as you get a chance :)</div></div><hr />

has anyone noticed the nerf to their riding crop as well? Once you ding 71, your riding crop will be worthless. Did anyone see anything in the Beta to give us that 10% speed bonus back?</div></div><hr />

Had SFF for a while now, but finally succomed to the tempting exclamation above the trainer's head.<br />
<br />
The quests themselves were pretty good, but wow, that really was back to the bad old days of WoW quests where you get sent to one corner of the contintent, kill a mob, come back again, go to the other corner, rinse and repeat.  On the plus side it's easy to do the travelling while you iron, paint the house, go for a walk/to the shops etc etc.<br />
<br />
And it's a few hundred gold, and you can do Eric Settekh halls in about 10-15 mins if you take a h00tkin and 2 warlocks at level 80 :D.  No pony for my helpers tho :(</div></div><hr />

There's a new name for them I hadn't thought of yet or heard.<br />
<br />
Hootkin.  <br />
<br />
Yeah I still don't have swift flight form...I haven't managed to farm the gold for it...and honestly, haven't really been working much with the druid lately.  I imagine I'll be level 300 before I get Swift Flight form...</div></div><hr />

i literally yelled at a coworker the other day who told me he was levling his druid and was planning on buying SFF from the trainer...<br />
<br />
it was when i pointed out that he needed the quest chain to get the key for a shot at the Anzu mount that he decided to go ahead and do the quest chain.<br />
<br />
on a sad note: the video that Riverwish posted here a WHILE ago deosn't seem to be there anymore :( that was a very helpful video.</div></div><hr />

I've been talking to folks I meet, as I think I'm looking for a new and more active guild for my druid...Ain't I just growing up too fast now? hehe</div></div><hr />
