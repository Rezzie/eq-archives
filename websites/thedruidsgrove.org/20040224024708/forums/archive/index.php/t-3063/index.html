<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sawtooth 1234</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm considering the purchase of a Ceramic Totem of Xegony that has Spell Haste IV focus effect  (15% spell haste).<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if that focus effect would &quot;stack&quot; with the Cleric spell &quot;Blessing of Reverance&quot;, which gives you 10% spell haste?<br />
<br />
I think there is a 20% spell haste cap.  I'm wondering if both of the above, combined, would take you to the 20% cap, or would it leave you at 15% given that the total of the focus effect and the spell would exceed the 20% cap.<br />
<br />
Any info appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seriena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They do stack. I don't know anything about a cap though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The cap is 50%, not 20%.  There are a number of focus effects that gives more than 20% spell haste by themselves.  Look at Affliction Haste for example (33% spell haste on dots).<br />
<br />
The cap really only makes a difference when you have spell haste from AA's.  This stacks with both spell haste focus effects and Blessing of Reverence.  Quick Evac 3, for example, gives you 50% spell haste on evac spells by itself; focus effects and Blessing of Reverence stack with Quick Evac but won't take you past the cap of 50%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, it's a 50% cap.  It's the same deal with Quick Buff AA -- once you hit 50% casting time reduction, it won't go down any more with items or spells.  If memory serves, with stacking buffs/items, the effect is purely additive, so you just remove that percentage from the base cast time for each effect to get your total.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is also a min cast time of 2.5 sec on spells greater than 2.5 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AzariahTunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For those of you that blast a lot, I've found stacking our 10% AA plus blessing of reverence plus spell haste 4 to be a lot of fun and great DPS (well agro too :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I haven't found that to be the case, Kineada...I've gotten my Nature's Infusion cast time from 3.8 seconds down to 2.3 seconds with Nightcaller Leggings (30% beneficial spell haste) and Blessing of Reverence (10%).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Batou062671</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The limit is that you can't have spell haste effect spells who's cast time is less than 3.0 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, that's not entirely true either.  Most spell haste effects do have a minimum base cast time of 3 seconds.  However:<br />
<br />
Spell Haste I works on spells up to level 20, and has a minimum cast time of only 1 second.<br />
lucy.fnord.net/spell.html...ource=Live (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2339&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
Spell Haste II works on spells up to level 44, and has a minimum cast time of only 2 seconds.<br />
lucy.fnord.net/spell.html...ource=Live (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2340&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
So if you have low level spells with short cast times, and you want them to be shorter, Spell Haste I or II might be helpful.  (Ok, so it's a bit of a stretch...)  The only practical use I can think of is AE stuns for an enchanter, which can be situationally useful even at high levels.  Spell Haste I should drop Color Flux (ENC/4) from 1.0 to 0.9 and Color Shift (ENC/20) from 1.5 to 1.3.  Spell Haste II should drop Color Skew (ENC/44) from 2 to 1.7.</div></div><hr />
