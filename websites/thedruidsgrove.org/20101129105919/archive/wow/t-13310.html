<br />
We managed it last night mainly down to excellent healing from our priest and a bit of luck on my part as I started to figure the fight out.<br />
<br />
About halfway through the fight I started to get the gist of how it was working and adapted my strategy to attempt to time Lifeblooms on as many people as possible so they'd bloom in the healing window and then chucking out a Wildgrowth and a healing touch on whoever had the least health plus if I could get away with it a swiftmended Rejuve applied before the healing window opened with varying degrees of success.<br />
<br />
I was just wondering how others approach the fight.</div></div><hr />

- time blooms of lifebloom<br />
- wild growth 2 sec bevor the healing window<br />
- 2 regrowth in the healing window<br />
- if lucky 1 swiftmend</div></div><hr />

The two groups are told to stay together for aoe heals to hit the max number of targets.<br />
<br />
I stack three lb on the three people lowest so it will bloom during the window.  Other people get a LB that will just tick during the window, sometimes even a three stack since it is 3 seconds of healing when the window opens.  I time a HT on the target that is not one of the three to get a bloom, and then do a WG centered on me and a regrowth if there is time.<br />
<br />
I also might get time for a moonfire on the boss right when the window closes, before rinsing and repeating.</div></div><hr />
