The guide said to buy the recipe from vendor Ulthir in Darnassus.<br />
Even alla.com and thotbot say he is the only alliance vendor that sells it.<br />
But the vendor Ulthir only sellls Rage and Free action. Once you buy those two recioes....they vanish but &quot;respawn&quot; in his inventory 15 minutes later.<br />
 I visited Ulthir for hours and never saw the recipe Superior Mana Potion for sale.<br />
Was this recipe removed from the game?<br />
Do some items have a several day respawn timer? <br />
Ulthirs other items are set at 15 minutes, why would this be different?<br />
I am goin crazy because i feel like i will be the only Alchemist who does not make Superior Mana Potions.<br />
Does anyone have experience with Ulthir and this particular recipe?<br />
Any idea on how and what type of timer do vendors use?</div></div><hr />

You need to complete that quest line and receive a spectral essence, which will allow you to speak with ghost vendors on the Scholo island once you equip it.  <br />
<br />
The Superior Mana Pot recipie is BoP, so it will never be on the Ah.  The quest line is pretty fun, and starts with the two humans standing by the scholo building just to the right of the entrance.</div></div><hr />
