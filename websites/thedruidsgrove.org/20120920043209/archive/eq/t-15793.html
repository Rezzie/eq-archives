In the near future, we're going to make a change that will reduce the amount of hate generated by DoTs so I wanted to give a head's up.  For most damage spells, they generate aggro based on the base amount of damage they do.  DoTs do this as well, generating hate based on their damage every tick, but they also generate initial aggro worth one tick of damage when they first land.  This means that they basically have one extra damage tick's worth of aggro at all times. <br />
<br />
We're changing things so that you won't gain aggro based on the DoTs damage until it actually does its first tick of damage which will bring them in line with other damage spells for the amount of hate they generate.<br />

I am not a high level, end of game content Druid - far from it, but one less tick of agro....  whatever.</div></div><hr />

So for DoTs that do 1k base (Necro's have one) then yea, 1k reduction in agro generation everytime you cast the spell is big.<br />
<br />
Anything helps really.</div></div><hr />

As I am still only 70 and have no experience with the high level DoTs, I may be looking at this in the wrong way.  I guess any improovement is good for us!!!</div></div><hr />

Yep.  I liked the spell, but the aggro was getting me in trouble in our 'usual' group scenarios.   Going to save it for GoM procs for now ;)</div></div><hr />

This spell does a DD nuke worth 3055,for Rank I, then turns into a DoT. I could be incorrect on this however, because the spell is listed in with the other fire DoTs. But I will agree on one point, this is an agro hog spell..lol. In groups and on raids I have to wait for the mob to be into the 80s% of HP before I cast it or there is a chance I will get agro and even then I've snatched agro. Either way, this sounds like a great idea. Lets hope it works correctly and doesn't jump our agro up rather than down :eek:</div></div><hr />
