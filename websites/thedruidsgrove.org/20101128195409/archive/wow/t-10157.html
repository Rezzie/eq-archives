<br />
as im finding out with some things in the talent builder, some things look better on paper then in actual use.  please advise and give input.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance :-)<br />

I think this is prob the best Tank build.<br />
<br />
Here's why I changed what I did.<br />
<br />
Resto - Furor is just great.  Having 10 rage/40 energy when you shift is worth far more then the slight benefits of Imp. MotW.<br />
<br />
Balance - Omen of Clarity is worth the 1pt once you buy into Natural Weapons.  You might swap out a pt of Shifter instead of Thorns... but rage/energy/mana free attacks/casts are great.<br />
<br />
Feral - You want all the agro you can get if you seriously wanna base a carrer around tanking so Feral Instinct at 3/5 is a good idea.  I'd take Thick Hide over Feral Aggression just so when people question your tanking viability, you can tout the highest AC possible... but it's still not worth more then 3pts given your spread.  Primal Fury is another great talent, more free rage = more mauls and swipes = more agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">02-27-2006, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick note:  Furor is a great talent.<br />
<br />
As a tank:  Pull with Starfire.  Then do one of the following:<br />
1.  Moonfire, Bear, Maul immediately (furor=free rage)<br />
2.  Bear, Feral Charge immediately (furor=free rage)<br />
<br />
Either way it'll let you do two things:<br />
1.  Save your growl for a second mob or emergency.<br />
2.  Hold aggro through a rogue opener or initial mage crit.</div></div><hr />

This may sound really stupid, but do you respecc everytime you do different things? I mean, I can't see speccing for MT then having to respec to go into BGs as a feral/resto. <br />
<br />
Just a bit confused as to what temp you use in different situations...sort of an all-terrain tire question lol</div></div><hr />
