We are starting Kara this Tuesday, so expect I'll have Kara drops coming in over the next month or so.  What slots (that don't drop in Kara) should I work on upgrading?  You can mention badge items, but unless something changes soon, I don't expect to have too many badges rollin' in.  I only need a couple more to get my Idol of Terror.<br />
<br />
So, what craftable (or rep rewards) pieces should I start looking into?<br />
<br />
Right now I'm going to start grinding the mats for the Belt of Natural Power (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30042), assuming I can find someone on the server that can craft the item.<br />
<br />
NOTE:  For some reason the Armory incorrectly lists my health.  In game (in Bear form), I only have 14.7K health.  Not 16.8K.  I still can't figure out what is going on with that...</div></div><hr />

Though last night I couldn't find one on the AH.  Over the weekend there were 6+.  Weird.<br />

Looks like I forgot to log out in my tanking gear again.  I need to make that a habit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a craftable / rep thing, but see if you can get your hands on a Badge of Tenacity and the Argussian Compass (to be replaced by the Heroic MgT trinket if / when you get that)<br />
<br />
Once you start running Kara, you'll be swimming in badges.  Each boss (after attunemen) drops 2 badges.</div></div><hr />

Not the best trinket by far.  I'm sure there are better, but that one's decent for mitigation if you don't have your Pocketwatch from Moroes yet.</div></div><hr />

I have Badge of Tenacity.  So, between Charm of Alacrity (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25787) and Argussian Compass (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27770), which one would you choose?  The former does not have an &quot;equip&quot; function but it has a better (IMO) on use function (increase dodge rating by 192 for 10s).  Whereas the later has +36 sta and its use function doesn't seem all that great (reduce damage by 68 for upto 1150 total damage for 20s).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just more mitigation to help out your healers a bit that you can hit every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Like I said, you will most likeley be getting the pocket watch off of Moroes (first real boss in Kara - really easy kill) which will last you a LONG time.</div></div><hr />

I stumbled upon what has to be our server's uber Horde Druid tank.  He made it for me.  I often deal with his alt as he is a primo enchanter/JC (has all enchants and all but a few stones).  Never knew he had a Druid main.  Gave me lots of advice and gear sugguestions.  We must have talked for 30-40 minutes last night.  He was far friendlier than I would have expected from someone at that level of playing.  Plus he actually typed out whole words.  Must be an old guy like me. :)</div></div><hr />

Well, for the Sta and because the other trinket is absolutely worthless and a completely wasted trinket slot until activated (which only benefits you for a maximum 1/9th of the time, assuming you activate it every cooldown, which you probably wouldn't).  <br />
<br />
Even then, Moroes' Pocketwatch (which still hasn't dropped for me in over 8 months of running Kara on my druid- DAMN YOU RNG) or the Commendation of Kael'thas are much better options.  Obviously you'll have to be running Kara to get the pocket watch, but the CofK is from heroic MgT which only requires a single run of regular MgT to attune for it.</div></div><hr />

could be worth me trying to find someone who can craft it.</div></div><hr />

The only time I typically mash my trinket button is on a boss mob (after a few hits land) or if something crazy happens on a pull.  I'll switch to the compass.  Put the old trinket in the bank.</div></div><hr />

Not a lot else for bears, honestly, unless you're a leatheworker. The alchemist trinket isn't bad but isn't that great. The Shattered Sun pendant of resolve is a good poor man's version of Brooch of Deftness, especially if you're Aldor. Earthwarden, of course.</div></div><hr />

the extra stam did not seem enough to make up for it over using the Strength of the Unnamed  http://thottbot.com/i29173</div></div><hr />

While you do lose avoidance you gain a large chunk of stam and hit rating and expertise are excellent for bears. Try and get your defense from elsewhere; it'll allow you to swap out amulets on a per-fight basis more easily, and sometimes you want to make sure that you hit as much as humanly possible; other times you'll want max avoidance. It also allows you to use the necklace of the deep, which is better than either option on a general basis.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34680<br />
 <br />
How much dodge you do end up loosing from that 21 agil though? Otherwise I can certainly see the appeal of the brooch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kalbear</div><div class="date">05-07-2008, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shattered Sun Pendant of Resolve (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34680). <br />
<br />
It really depends on what you're going for. The Necklace of the Deep  gemmed like that gives you about 1.5% avoidance and a bit of crit. The Brooch of Deftness gives, by itself, 4% reduction in overall missed/dodged/parried attacks. That's clearly a big boost in threat. It also avoids burst damage (via parried attacks) about twice as well as the necklace does. <br />
<br />
Personally, I use the avoidance necks when I'm facing bosses where it really matters (things like VR or Morogrim where strings of avoidance matter most) and use the expertise where early threat matters the most and where parries need to be removed at all costs (Gruul is an example, as is the shaman in FLK or Anetheron in Hyjal). Having the ability to switch is really key here. <br />
<br />
The brooch is also really great when you outgear the content significantly. I kind of wish I had bought the shattered sun pendant instead and saved my badges, but the brooch has its place.</div></div><hr />

Is the NotD that good?  I lose both Stam &amp; Agi with it (if I change from my OL green!).</div></div><hr />

Tbh, I can't remember, and I'm behind a firewall, so no armory.  I think I logged in my bear suit, tho.  In any case, I'll be very happy if I can use NotD since I bought one last night!  Saw the sockets, but I have no high-end gems, and the ones on AH are meh.</div></div><hr />

The idol is worthless for tanking, you ought to have at least Idol of Wild.  If not get the Idol of Terror ASAP (20 badges and great for solo kitty and pvp).  Also, staff of beasts is nice DPS staff, but Braxxis (a 30g AH buy) is a better tanking staff until you can get the Earthwarden.  Work on our SSO rep (its easy, free gold and sometimes badges) so you can get the exalted DPS neck (for kitty) and the tanking neck (for trash, keep the NotD for boss fights)<br />

Maybe you logged out in your cat kit?<br />

Here's a good Bear gear starting guide...<br />
<br />
http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/04/15/shifting-perspectives-gearing-your-bear-tank-from-70-to-karazha/<br />
<br />
NOTE:  The use of PvE Rep PvP (http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=742) gear for hands and shoulders.  This are easy to get (thru rep turns) and very cheap.  Plus they give a ton of +res so you can replace the +def gems and enchants for &quot;better&quot; choices.<br />
<br />
Bear enchants by slot...<br />
http://teethandclaws.blogspot.com/2007/12/feral-tanking-enchants-by-slot.html<br />
<br />
Until you reach 15K-16K health in bear, I gem +12 sta regardless of socket bonus and enchant +agi (or +stats).  As you gear improves keep your health near 16K and start adding more +agi gems to increase your dodge.</div></div><hr />

I do have the quest reward idol from HP, but my gear switches slightly when I shift to caster (i.e. when hearthing).  <br />
Also, staff of beasts is nice DPS staff, but Braxxis (a 30g AH buy) is a better tanking staff until you can get the Earthwarden. <br />
Thanks, I'll check for it on AH.<br />
Work on our SSO rep (its easy, free gold and sometimes badges) so you can get the exalted DPS neck (for kitty) and the tanking neck (for trash, keep the NotD for boss fights)<br />
Working on it...<br />
I did buy some +12 Stam gems last night, and 'quipped my NotD for a run...seems like a good piece.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the site, uhh...cites.  Can't see most of them through the firewall, but will check them out at home.</div></div><hr />
