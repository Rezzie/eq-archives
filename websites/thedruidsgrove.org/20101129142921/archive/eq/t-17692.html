<br />
LOS ANGELES (AFP) – US automaker Tesla Motors unveiled its state-of-the-art five-seat sedan here Thursday, billed as the world's first mass-produced, highway-capable electric car.<br />
<br />
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said the company, which last year released a breakthrough two-seater roadster, aims to have its sleek &quot;Model S&quot; sedan rolling off assembly lines by 2011.<br />
<br />
The futuristic zero-emission vehicle will be powered by lithium-ion battery packs capable of between 160 and 300 miles (257 and 482 kilometers) per charge.<br />
<br />
The car has an anticipated base price of 57,400 dollars but will cost less than 50,000 after a federal tax credit of 7,500 dollars, Musk said.<br />

<br />
The rest are just champions of pissing away our tax dollars.<br />
<br />
At $50K, this thing would be mainstream and competitive with current terrorism-financing models.</div></div><hr />
