I did WSG with pretty much the same group about 7 times last night. What was cool is that there were two sets of opponents. At the start, one set ran over us 3-0 the other we were even but they one. By the end of our time about 5 hours later, against the same opponents, we were rolling over the group we were matched well with, and the ones that rolled over us were now evenly matched. I am 19, so no cat/prowl yet, but I still felt like a serious threat. I died a lot, who doesn't, but as one of only two healers on our side I was happy with how we did. In any case, I had a great time doing BG.<br />
<br />
I know its a relative number and all, but does anyone know about how many HK you need to gain the first rank?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starfire</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It depends on how much you participate.<br />
<br />
I got rank 2 (grunt) and I have 699 kills right now (including about 20 kills from people raiding XR, a raid on astranaar, and some night elves my friends and I jumped in nightsong woods.<br />
<br />
BUT.  I also healed, spelled, and switched to feral forms to fight everyone.  I made sure I got damage in on every single kill I could, as well as supporting my allies in WSG/Raids.<br />
<br />
Now,  I know this because there was another guy in Ogr, that was a private, and only level 33.  I check this honor page, and he had close to 1,600 kills!<br />
<br />
Honor determines rank upgrades.  Honor kills are just, flashy badges; you get a kill even if you were sitting in the regeneration hut recovering from a big fight.  Honor kills get you honor, so the better you do participating in afight, and ESPECIALLY running the flag (I have literally 1-2-3'd the silverwing flag as soon as the fight began with dash and that speed buff!) will get you max honor.<br />
<br />
Good luck!!  Scout rank gets you a nice tabard for 1g, and grunt rank gets you that sick dispell poly/fear/stun Insignia of the Horde.  When I hit level 30,  I'll be in AB getting my sargeant's cloak!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to clarify something Starfire muddled up... as long as your grouped and within' 100yards or so of the kill you get honor.  You don't need to attack, you don't need to do anything really other then be grouped.  So make sure your grouped and your gtg.  Running the flag/cap'n nodes/defending nodes does nothing to increase your honor/contribution.</div></div><hr />

I can't check now while I'm at work, but it should be in my profile. I doubt I actually got 250 kills in 8 BGs but I did get a lot of bonus honor for killing sergents and the like. Also for winning and turning in trinkets afterwords. Who knows. I'm just happy that I might be able to become Scout Nyteleaf. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">12-02-2005, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, my 240 kills from that first night was translated into 1100+ honor I think. So maybe I'll be a corporal soon. I'm dyin to get that anti-fear trinket. So far the only two classes I have ANY problem with are priests and shamans. I don't have enough ranged damage to get them. Shamans are really tough at this level. Their fireshock and fire totems can rack up damage pretty quick. By the time I get to them I'm either at half health or half mana because I've healed and morphed out of the earthbinds. Then again while they focus on me, the rogues sneak in for the kill. Best tactic I've seen though. There was a druid as their flag runner with two shaman guards. All three were taurens. The shamans just ran behind one guarding /healing and the other did nothing but drop earthbind totems. I couldn't catch them. No one could catch them. And if somehow we did get close, one would stop and warstomp. While the other kept going. I would either try root, which the druid shifted out of, or shift several times myself and show up mana less as an easy target. Now that I'm in the twenties though that will change. I have cat now and can prowl a bit. I can't wait until a faster run speed. <br />
<br />
Any low level tips for the BG, good hiding places and whatnot would be appreciated. I've only been in WSG so thats all I know for now.<br />

<br />
I was in a 20-man raid, these guys were set up as a big ass PUG from somewhere...<br />
<br />
<br />
Me and 2 friends were in Sun Rock Retreat killing horde.  We run out the back to see if any horde were farming spiders, and see this one dwarf.  He invites us to his raid, and it turns up to be a huge party.  It was going well.  Got some lowbies, killed every gaurd, even killed the flight master!!! I've got the screenshots of me standing over his corpse, too.<br />
<br />
THEN.  Things got bad.  Those morons got so trigger happy they ran into the tent, and somehow AE'd a civilian...  I wound up with three dishonorable kills.<br />
Then,  a few 60s in epic gear from Short Bus decided to show up, and proceed to split our group up, and from there decimate us.  That raid sucked.<br />

Nyte, the regen/berzerker huts are nice.  Try sneaking along the right side, then up through that little path near the alliance base.  It leads up and around, and then go right into a little door.  You will be upstairs in the base, inside the little huts.  You can also run up to their roof, and fire off spells or jump down for the flag from there.<br />
<br />
If you are playing with noobs, be ready to find out that your flag is being hidden by a level 29 night elf rogue.  Some places he will hide are around his base.  There are a lot of little doodad areas...  it sucks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whitehouse</div><div class="date">12-07-2005, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its slow going once you hit stone guard. if you like the rewards just keep at it. and don't quit. if you quit working the ranks it will take forever to regain what you lost. it took months to regain blood guard once the BGs finally hit. as BGs hit we just got into our upper level instances and everyone wanted to go for their blue sets. so we didn't work at PvP too much. my blood guard status [pre-BGs - mostly Tarren Mill excursions] quickly dwindled to sergeant and was easily maintained with an AV run here and there. <br />
once they opened AB though and fun was had by all our ranks started their slow climb back up.<br />
so far we've been roughly maintaining an average of about 30-50,000 honor a week for the slow climb. if that is not enough to advance through legionnaire [rank 8 for you alliance] then i doubt i'll see rank 9, the grind will be too much. but if the advancement continues all the better then.<br />
servers may vary but i think you'll notice a level of advancement according to your play style. remember kill count doesn't matter, its winning BGs or at least participating.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to get level 2 for the trinket. I was expecting it to take a lot more than just maybe 12 games total. I'll stop and keep leveling now so I can get my travel form and some better equipment. I'm really not that comptetitive kill wise anyways right now in BG with most of the opponents having seven levels on me. <br />

Just, divide your time between WSG and questing.  I try to take care of at least 10 quests per weekend.</div></div><hr />

They would level and quest and collect items durring the week, and then PvP on the weekends and on BG holidays while the bonus honor is extra and put their collected items up in the AH. This will allow them a decent amount of honor each week so they will at least keep their present ranking, and still give them lots of time to advance their character and make some money. I think this is what I am going to do. I enjoy BG, but I would rather get at least to level 40 so I get all the forms and talents available before I get into PvP on a more regular basis. I am so looking forward to feline swiftness in a couple levels and travel form in a few more. If I haven't said it before I hate running so slow. EQ spoiled me with SoW.<br />

I totally know what you are talking about.  My first time going in WSG was with this druid.  10-19 was great!  I went in at level 16....and I made plenty of enemies on the other side with my roots.  I've become so addicted to WSG now and it's all my bf's fault...haha.  <br />
<br />
At first I wasn't enjoying the 20-29....too many people didn't seem to know what they were doing and it frustrated me because the 10-19 bracket teams were awesome....but that has all changed.  Unfortunately I will be leaving the 20-29 bracket soon....I'm half way to level 30.  I will probably quest a lil bit to get to atleast 34 or 36 and then do a good mix between WSG and SM....my two favority things!</div></div><hr />
