<br />
I set this as only one choice so if you daddle around here and there, choose the MOST significant one.<br />
<br />
I left out fishing, cooking, first-aid, and all gathering ones are together if you only do 2 of the three (skinning, mining and herbalism.)<br />
<br />
ps  If you feel STRONGLY about something involving tradeskills, please post a reply.<br />
<br />
I love gathering, but would LOVE to do 2 gathering skills plus one of the actual skills. I cook and do bandaids on all my characters.<br />
<br />
Fishing at high levels is such a snoozefest to cap, I nearly pull my teeth out just for some excitement (I'm capped at 375 on 2 toons.)</div></div><hr />

My mage is a alch / tailor ( though leveling he was a skinner, that paid the bills )<br />
My shammy is a jewel/miner<br />
<br />
My druid is 375 fishing, close to that on cooking and somewhere near there on first aid too.<br />
<br />
I didn't level those secondary professions on my alts at all.</div></div><hr />

My hunter's herb/alchie, I've always liked that combo on her, plus gathering herbs on a hunter is just fun, between ice traps and feign for random mobs that try and get you while you're herbing xD  She's also my cook, I haven't leveled cooking on another character, but I don't really need to, one cook's enough for me. &gt;.&gt;<br />
My newbie prot pally's a miner/engineer, so far that's working out well, I need a miner in the outlands badly, so I'm determined to keep leveling him (so far so good, haven't got burnt out yet *crosses fingers*).<br />
<br />
I also have my lock who's stuck at 45 but has higher level tailoring/enchanting, I use her for DEing everything I get even in the outlands.  I also have a balance druid stuck at 44 who's a jewelcrafter, and while I enjoyed the profession, I sadly got bored of oomkin pewpew quicker than I thought I would, so he's shelved for now. :(  Oh and I also have a lil' 30-some warrior who's been shelved for quite some time, she's mining/blacksmithing.  I may pick her up again to level with some friends.<br />
<br />
Soo I got all of 'em covered... lol. Hard for me to pick a fav since I haven't maxed out most of 'em, but lw sucks yessss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First Aid is so easy to level. Cooking isn't too bad but Fishing was buffed I think. Much easier to skill up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High end guilds similar to mine are requiring flasks now for all runs but the cost/farmability for them is still in question.<br />
<br />
Whether or not it's profitable for a profession remains to be seen since the patch is still very new.<br />
<br />
Jewlcrafting atm seems to be the most profitable atm.</div></div><hr />

I thought about doing a whole bunch of gathering to make money but it just seemed less exciting then making my own clothing.  Now if only I could create rainbow colored boots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knaac</div><div class="date">05-31-2007, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do herbalism/skinning right now.  Skinning provides a steady drip of money, but Herbalism can be really profitable.  (Plus, I can skin and pick herbs while in forms, including travel form).  I also mail herbs to an alchemist friend when I want pots.  <br />
<br />
Eventually I may drop herbalism to pick up leatherworking so that I can make some of the good BOP gear.</div></div><hr />

Will probably drop alchemy soon and pick up some gatherer profession, since the change to resists pots being completely worthless along with the battle/guardian/flask changes, coupled with health/mana pots available from vendors, I find being an alchemist a complete waste. As soon as I get a trinket with better DPS than Alchemist's Stone, I plan on dropping alchemy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LW I picked up recently to make some of the new crafted stuff for myself and my wife's Hunter.  On the whole, I think it's better to know a LW than be one, but I get to be the one people know.  (shrug)</div></div><hr />

That or Herb/Alch are the best profs imo.<br />
