<br />
anyone know a site that has Wrath profession levelling guides.....specifically LW ?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-01-2008, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have not found one yet, but I have leveled LW to 420 without much trouble by only buying/learning the patterns that take only leather (borean or Heavy Borean) and have easily gotten their without needing to buy leather.  <br />
<br />
**I do buy leather regularily, but that I turn around and sell for easy profit.  AH is so easy to manipulate right now.**</div></div><hr />

<br />
borean / heavy borean is quite expensive atm.<br />
<br />
i saw a stack of heavy the other day (the only one) for 200g !  and cheap price for a stack of borean is 20-22g. others are asking anything upto 40g a stack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-01-2008, 12:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he...hehe...sorry as a skinner in TBC I couldn't make money to save my soul!  So, I am really enjoying the insane inflation on leathers atm.  <br />
<br />
I think the Borean leather is still going to be your cheapest route atm since Primals (or whatever we are calling them now) and  specialty leathers are even more insane.  Expect to use between 6-20 heavy borean leathers per skill point from 400-425ish.  After 420, most of your points will come from specialty patterns, that are learned from a vendor that you purchase with...you guessed it, even more leather!<br />
<br />
I would seriously consider picking up skinning on an alt if you have one high enough.  I was capped with skinning skill on day 2 of WotLK with about 3 hours of play time in.  There are skinnable bodies everywhere atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's my issue Sol, i only have limited time and tbh i've never had the patience to level through the same content again.  so i only have a lvl 58 that's been at this level for about a yr !<br />
<br />
so unlike just about every other wow player i know i am 'stuck' with just 2 profs on 1 char. it does make the game much harder tbh.<br />
<br />
i am going to try a DK once my main is 80 so if i can level one of these reasonably quickly he will for sure be a skinner !!! not sure wot else -a chanter for DE would be good.  else he will be a alchy cos i do like the look of alcy these days with the specialisations you can do....<br />
<br />
but the thought of a DK grind from 55 to 70 and onward is like 'urghhh'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-02-2008, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I can't speak from experience, but the first 80 in our guild was actually a DK.  They have made the leveling much quicker through the TBC content from what I have heard.  Also, with two different starting zones in Northrend you should have a slightly different leveling experience with your second toon.  <br />
<br />
I suffer from a shortage of time too, so I understand where you are coming from.  And I loathe leveling, but love alts...explain that??   <br />
<br />
Yes, you buy patterns for specialty leather working (blues lvl 78+) for 3x Heavy Borean leather each.  (talk to the guy outside the LW building in Daralan to see options)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-02-2008, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i would need to do the DK in HF not BT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-02-2008, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got my DK to lvl 70 in just over 1 day and 6 hours played. Between rested XP, the heavily increased quest XP, Carbonite and a general familiarity of the zone, questing flew by. <br />
 <br />
I entered outland at 58, and got to 68 only doing the quests in HFP, Zangamarsh and Nagrand, and like 2 in Terokar. I went to Borean Tundra and got the next 2 levels really quickly. Still haven't picked up a prof on him, as leveling was so fun. (yeah, it was actually fun. AoE killing with Unholy would make taking on 5+ mobs at a time no problem, and I solo'd every single elite quest the whole way. OP indeed). I'm leaning toward herbalism / skinning to make some money for an epic flyer, then most likely dropping skinning for either alchemy or enchanting.<br />
 <br />
For a DK, I'd start in BT, and at least do the beginning quests cause you'll get a really nice blue 2h Axe with like 118.6 dps. Huge upgrade that makes leveling a lot easier. Then head over to HF.<br />
 <br />
Once playing a DK its hard to go back to 'regular toons' for traveling as they get a 20% bonus to mounted speed (and 15% to run speed). My regular mounted toons seem so slow now :P<br />
 <br />
Interesting about buying patterns for mats. I just checked the enchanting trainer at Dalaran and its the same thing - most of the high end trainers are 'selling' recipies for Large Shards. Guess its better that way - still farming a lot of instances, but don't have to rely on getting a lucky drop (over 70 runs of Shattered Halls and no Savagery enchant !!! &gt;&lt;)<br />
 <br />
Good link for the benefits of individual professions: http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&amp;topic=45363<br />
 <br />
I have been looking around and haven't really found any 375 - 450 leveling guides yet. Should start popping up in a little bit though. I'll link one if I find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'll need to look into them more when i'm ready to level one and choose the best levelling spec i think regardless of what i'd really prefer. money is no problem for an epic mount for him. i just have to have skinning !<br />
<br />
i did manage to buy half a dozen stacks of Borean leather yesterday for only 14g a stack ! so i'm finally starting to level LW !</div></div><hr />

<br />
the GOOD news is that there's a 32 slot bag we can make that is very inexpensive mats-wise... lookin forward to getting my LW to 415...</div></div><hr />

same with fur.....<br />

32 slot LW bag not a 32 slot ordinary bag ?<br />
<br />
<br />
think i am now around 396. bought some more borean.  and managed to sell a few heavy borean for 22g each. plus the borean armour kits i made to lvl sold for about 10g each</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This bag is actually an &quot;Inscription&quot; bag.  Or is there a LW bag pattern that I missed?  <br />
<br />
I am now at 428 LW skill, so I have stopped forcing leveling, and just selling my skill on the trade channel and getting skill points with someone else's mats. <br />
<br />
Also the &quot;lining&quot; abilities are still yellow for me.  I have gotten many points just because I change gear and have to re-line my bracers or pants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i must have read that [Pack of Endless Pockets] wrong. &lt;sigh&gt; i looks like I'm going to have to buy Haris Pilton's Bag after all... I was really trying to hang onto some of my coin...<br />
<br />
There IS the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thottbot.com/i38399&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.thottbot.com/ic/32/inv_misc_bag_21.jpg&quot; border=0 height=32 width=32 style=&quot;vertical-align:middle&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#0068FF&quot;&gt;Trapper&quot;s Traveling Pack&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which is a 28 slot LW bag... That's available at 420 but there's a faction rep requirement of Revered by the Kalu'ak...<br />
<br />
I'm gonna hafta check that pattern again tonight in Dalaran... I can't believe i missed that inscription part, even though thottbot has it there plain as day... Thottbot also says it's available at 420, and the other night i know i saw it available at 415 in-game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know I am able to keep all my gear (bear,Car,heal) on me with LW stuff, food, raid buffs, reagents etc in just 18-20 slotters and still have 30 or so slots available for trash drops and quest junk.  The merger of gear has really helped open up room in the bags.<br />
<br />
They really need to make a &quot;GEAR&quot; bag like they have for other specialty bags...a 32 slot gear bag would be EPIC!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-09-2008, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've just got a tailor to make me a 20 slotter and hoping she will keep doing me some primal mooncloth for at least another 4/5 bags.<br />
<br />
carrying around 3 sets of gear plus everything else is a PITA.  <br />
<br />
and it seems worse in Wrath as every dam quest seems to need to you carry around an item.....explosives / scepters / etc etc<br />
<br />
and i keep getting all these drops / q rewards and i look at some and think...hmmm better keep that its looks quite nice for oomkin or its looks good once they nerf our armour multiplier and i can try out different gear ! lol<br />
<br />
i'm loathe to pay haris pilton 1200g a bag.<br />
<br />
i was hoping Wrath would bring at least a standard bag of 26+ slots and not cost 2000g in mats /rolleyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-09-2008, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't loose heart yet.  Trade skills are clearly not done being developed yet!  <br />
<br />
If you level past 420 or so in any trade skill you will see gapeing holes in leveling/patterns.  I would assume there will be another release that includes new patterns including larger bag options.  <br />
<br />
BTW, don't buy the Primal Mooncloth bags...the mats are crazy expensive. There is a Frostweave Bag that is the same size for a fraction of the cost.  In fact on our server tailors were paying to be able to craft people bags for skill points.  Mats are somthing like 6 bolts of imbued frostweave or somthing.  Its a lot of cloth, but if you aren't a tailor you are likely to be picking up piles of it during leveling anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-09-2008, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the frostweave ones are cheap:<br />
 <br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56007<br />
 <br />
6 Imbued Netherweave (90 Frostweave Cloth, 12 Infinite Dust)<br />
 <br />
Tailors everywhere leveling those.  There is a 22 slot bag, but the mats are more expensive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">12-10-2008, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well i've a load of primals in the bank so been using them for her to create me the mooncloth.<br />
<br />
and i did notice that the primals themselves are now very cheap in wrath. seen them going for around 5-7g each.<br />
<br />
yeah i've been getting a lot of frostweave but i suspect that the infinite dust is not cheap as a 'new' wrath item ?<br />
<br />
what mats for the 22 slotter ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">12-10-2008, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glacial Bag:<br />
 <br />
4x Moonshroud<br />
4x Ebonwave<br />
1x Eternium thread<br />
 <br />
... which is:<br />
 <br />
120 frostweave cloth<br />
16 infinite dust<br />
8 eternal shadow<br />
8 eternal life<br />
1 Eternium Thread<br />
 <br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41600<br />
 <br />
Also, there is a cooldown to make the moonshroud / ebonweave just like there was in bc to make mooncloth / spellcloth / shadowcloth.  <br />
 <br />
Overall, it looks like 1200g for a 'Gigantique bag' is almost cheaper at this point for a 22-slotter.  Though as time goes on, price on eternals / dust / cooldowns will drop as demand goes down.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much the only thing that teaches after 415 are transmutes (you can spam green elixirs/potions up to 420/423-ish).<br />
<br />
Spam your way to 425, learn earthsiege diamond transmute<br />
<br />
After that I suggest you friend a jewelcrafter and transmute their Earthsiege/Skyflare diamonds.  There's no cooldown.  <br />
<br />
At 430 I believe you learn all the flasks so you could also learn that way.  The mats for the spellpower elixir are pretty cheap.</div></div><hr />
