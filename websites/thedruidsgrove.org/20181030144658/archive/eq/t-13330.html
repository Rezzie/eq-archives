ICEWELL KEEP<br />
Dev quote:<br />
In each mission there is one Portion of a Coldain Historical Seal. Each mission has a different portion piece (Check the Lore Text to find out which is which).<br />
<br />
The first mission contributes 10% of the power of the augment.<br />
The second mission contributes 15% of the power of the augment.<br />
The third mission contributes 65% of the power of the augment.<br />
<br />
You of course have to turn in the Portion to Dain`s Historian Duggans to get the bit you need to power the augment.<br />
Dain's Historian Duggins gives out what appears to be one of the two progressive MMs the devs mentioned. There is a drop from each one that you turn into Duggins to get some kind of augment or reward. It appears that these can be done in any order.<br />
<br />
Note: Duggins is not in Thurgadin, but in Icewell Keep, the zone in the back of Thurgadin. Be aware of your Dain faction before you zone back there for those of you who used to raid the Dain.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Defense of Thurgadin&quot; Part I aka Dain Frostreaver the First<br />

<br />
We had the Shield drop once, and the ring twice.    <br />
<br />
Here is the basic strat:   <br />
Talk to Historian Duggans to get the mission.  We did the mission with 5 people.  One person is required to be Dain Frostreaver.  In addition, we had 2 healers and 2 tanks.  The last time we did it, we finished in about 30 minutes.    <br />
<br />
Here's what the mission consisted of:   <br />
Kill 3 named giants (chieftains?):   One is in the giant fort, one is next to the river on the far side of the mountains from Thurgadin, the last one is next to the dragon ring.  The one in the fort is accessed by killing one of the guards at the fort entrance.  The other guard has a low aggro range.  The Chieftain is straight ahead inside the entrance.  The 2nd is near the river.  He has 4 guards.  Dain aggro's and kills the Chieftain while the other 2 tanks kill the guards.  Keep the guards off of the healers.    Do the same at the Dragon Ring.    <br />
<br />
Kill 8 wolves:    <br />
Kill the 8 wolves that are near the entrance to Thurgadin.  If Dain is low on mana, he should med while the other tanks dispatch the wolves.  Try to single pull them if possible.    <br />
<br />
Kill The Warlord:    The Warlord will spawn at the entrance to Thurgadin.  The clerics should position themselves high on the wall to avoid his AE knockback.  Dain will aggro him and back into the right corner.  After Dain has aggro the other tanks will fight him from behind.    <br />
<br />
Everyone needs to loot a shard.  Pass out the other loot.  <br />
<br />
Zone into Thurgadin.  Turn the seal into the historian.  You have now completed the 1st step of the mission.  Hail the historian for the 2nd part when everyone in your group has looted the seal from the 1st part.  The mission only drops one seal per attempt, so you will have to do the 1st part until everyone has one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there another augment that is dropped within one of the missions? <br />
There is an augment that drops in the first mission.  I think it is not part of the progression itself though.  When I say final augment, that is what lucy is showing.  I have only received the seal from the 1st mission and when handed to the historian it has no stats.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to find definitive info on this mission on line.  So, I am cobbling together what pieces of information I can find.  Let me know if you find anything contradictory.<br />

I am uncertain which is common or rare.  The necklace was in the chest when we completed the mission successfully.<br />
<br />
Also, it would be nice if the XP shard auto dropped into inventory rather than having to loot it from the chest.  We finished really close to the time where this mission starts spawning deputies to wipe out your group, and one of our group members was unable to loot the shard in time though we finished the mission (kill 80 halflings in 60 minutes).</div></div><hr />
