 <br />
I have a 35ish druid (34 and change), and I think I'm going to keep it as my main toon (my original toon and main is a 50 necro from 1999 - sad, I know, but I'm just a casual player).  I have really enjoyed the high 20s and low 30s as a druid, so I think I might play this one more. <br />
 <br />
At any rate, I am looking for some decent gear.  Currently, I just have some easy buys from bazaar, totaling about 205 wisdom.  Some of that gear will increase as I get closer to the recommended levels, but I don't think they will bump the 255 mark.  I did the quest for the Earring of the Solstice, and I have loved that upgrade.  I am now looking for some more quests I can do before I get to 50ish that would give me some better gear.  Certainly, major gear upgrades occur when the Planes and other higher zones are accessible.  But surely there's something out there I can do from 35-50 (like the Earring of the Solstice) that could upgrade my gear.  I am thinking about camping the gobby in Dagnor's for the totem and the belt (as recommended in one of the stickies).  What else could I try?<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance for all the useful ideas!<br />

OH!!  And P.S....  If anyone knows of a good EMarr guild I could join for when I &quot;grow up&quot; and can start going on raids, please let me know!  I'm looking for a gang of older folks (working stiffs - I'm a lawyer) and other adult types, instead of trying to meet up with the younger crowd who stay up till 4 in the morning.</div></div><hr />

Best bet is to leech off guild members or buy plat on ebay.</div></div><hr />

I think they might be what you are looking for.  If interested you can contact me (Daghda) or my guild leader Curehart.</div></div><hr />

They are pretty fun, although a few quests appear to be broken, surprise, surprise. Be warned that a few of the mobs are quite surprising--such as Duskfall, who was level 33 and hit me for 225. He is snarable, though, as he found out to his peril!<br />
<br />
Right now I have 3 hp regen and 5 mana regen at level 35 doing only these quests--I do love the mana regen a lot!</div></div><hr />

He did not have the totem, but he did drop the reed belt, which is useful to me at 35ish (Burning Affliction 2 for long term dmg spells). I'm heading back there tonight to see if I can catch him again and get the totem.<br />

EDIT - It occurs to me that by staying up till midnight last night, I contradicted my first post in this thread regarding my desire to find a guild that doesn't stay up till 4 in the morning...  I acknowledge the contradiction and revise my earlier statement to reflect that I would like to find a guild that doesn't stay up till 4 in the morning OFTEN.  LOL!</div></div><hr />
