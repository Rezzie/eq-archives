 <br />
There are three Ebon Blade dailies that I've been doing out of North Icecrown.  Though I know that zone is filled with lots of dailies, I just haven't gotten around to putting together a good rotation / route to do them all</div></div><hr />

Thrusting Hodir's Spear is about the biggest pain in the butt I've ever come across in WoW... The sad part is that it awards 500 rep every time you complete it, so not doind it isn't really an option if you have any hope of getting Exalted with them within 2 months or so... I read somewhere that going from nuetral to exalted takes 23 days of doing every daily they offer.</div></div><hr />

I can make my own +52 dodge, +15 def enchant.</div></div><hr />

I'm jealous. Sons if Hodir dailies have turned into quite a grind, and the gankfest that goes along with that area just means it takes more time spirit flying to my corpse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
usually i try to do the 3 from shadow vault, the 2 in Yrhmiheim (Slaves and Blood of the Chosen), the 2 where you fly a machine and drop off infiltrators and escort a patrol up the path and then the Wyrmrest one killing dragons and the one collecting the pups near Moaki Harbour.<br />
<br />
Don't think i've got any for Sons rep yet.....</div></div><hr />

Rep seems to pour in from questing and 5-mans.  Since I have yet to see anything I need/want at exalted, getting to revered takes just a week or so of doing 5-mans and a few quests.<br />

Maybe I'm missing something...</div></div><hr />
