<br />
With cat form I ripped apart a mage and then he tried to Nova and get some distance, I just shifted and ran him down with the feline swiftness.<br />
<br />
2nd duel I said I wouldnt use any forms, so he sheeped me and I shifted to go back to normal, then just casted starfire, wrath, heal, moonfire spam FTW!<br />
<br />
Warriors I just bear tank then shift out to heal, back to bear, and I just wore them down.  Eventually some rooting and cat form attacks will probably be in order.</div></div><hr />

I mostly spend my time in AB which has a lot of smaller scale fights so I find the cat form DPS helps a lot in getting initial kills.  The ability to move so fast in stealth is great as well and the bear from changes allow me to actually do some decent DPS once I draw a crowd of melee on me.</div></div><hr />

The fact the Blizzard refuses to acknowledge through equipment sets that Feral Druids exist (and for that matter Balance Druids too really) pisses me off to no end.<br />
<br />
I am now Feral and I've seen some huge numbers scrolling past, 1000ish backstabs, 1700 Ravage.<br />
<br />
Feline Swiftness is one of the most awesome abilities in the Feral tree, 30% speed while meleeing means that nobody will ever get away from you on foot.<br />
<br />
My bear form is just uber, I have a massive amount of hp (pushing for 7k with Feral suit on) and I can Feral Charge into a group of alliance and live a long time before going down. We play the role as the Pallies do in alliance, soaking up damage while other classes put on the AE heat.<br />
<br />
The only thing I regret I lack in my Feral suit is spell resistance, pity the tree didn't give us some kind of elemental/arcane protection against nukers.<br />
<br />
I'm loving it though, but I sure do miss Innervate and the uber healing abilities I used to have. Losing Nature's Swiftness was like a physical blow, but I'm sure I'll get used to not having it.<br />

I haven't done any testing of Omen of Clarity yet, when I do I'll get back to you.</div></div><hr />

True to a good extent.  Although I have seen (and have aquired) some non class restricted leather gear thats not healing based drop in MC.  On the other hand, the epic feral gear you need to be striving for will be your faction/honor rewards via battlegrounds.  Its unfortunate that this is really our only means of getting feral gear but at this point of the game there isnt much else to do.  Although you may want to check out silithus and ZG.  There could be some good drops in those locations.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that can be annoying but its really not a big deal, most of the times I'm hibernated someone else breaks it right away and if its a small scale fight I'll shift out before it ever hits me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fendicano</div><div class="date">10-24-2005, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, after a week or more of analysis on the matter, I feel as if I can now post on this topic.  Feral is rapeage.  I can last forever in bear form.  In AB, I find it easy to get to healers and take them out.  Spells can be interrupted with efficiency.  Not to mention pallies can't throw up those damned shields if they are stunned.  <br />
<br />
On a PVP note, I was patrolling around STV the other day, keeping an eye on Nessingwary's just to help the lowbies out.  I was stealthing around in cat.  A 37 Undead Rogue walks up to Ness to turn in a quest.  I thought it would be funny to walk over by him so he gets the stealth sound and trips out.  I got about a yard away from his back and a 60 NE druid in cat jumps him.  I kindly return the favor.  The rogue runs off (I thought he would stay to help), and at this point I'm pretty sure I'm screwed.  The NE switches to OoMkin, I switch to bear, and he starts nuking me.  Got him down to about 50% health and I'm at 75-80%  As I haven't taken much, I decide to blow my bash now so that I will have it back later.  I bash him so he's stuck in OoMkin and continue to whale on him.  Pop frenzied regen to gain some health back.  He is at 1/4 health and unstunned now.  His hands start glowing green, so I back up and use Feral Charge to interrupt.  He then starts another heal and I'm pretty sure I'm screwed again.  The rogue comes back out of nowhere with a stun.  Couple more whacks and the NE dies.<br />
<br />
My question is:  Is feral THAT much better than it was now or did this guy just suck?  He was a Lieutenant and I got something like 209cp for killing him.  I was SIX levels below him and from what I saw, he had some epics on, but not full.  That should have been a walk in the park for him.  The only assistance I had was the 1 stun from the rogue (which saved my life).  Doesn't add up to me unless Feral is really kickin' now.  I believe it to be, but I'm wondering what others think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Torx</div><div class="date">10-25-2005, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 46 Tauren Druid on Burning Legion.  I'm completely 100% feral spec'd at the moment, and love every second of it.  I've been playing the Arathi Basin BG for my entire 40's.  All I can say is..  I LOVE my druid.  There is nothing like outrunning anyone with feline swiftness, just to crit them in the back several times over and over.   I usually stay in cat form the entire time and sneak around and chew up people on the backside of a battle that had no clue where I was.  I primarily focus on the priests and mages wrecking battle on the front line.  They get killed faster too.  My only problem is the paladins, but everything else eventually dies for me.  Its amazing how well I've held my own, even when I was low 40's vs these high level 40's.<br />
Sneaking around is my specialty..  I play a rogue on another server, so I enjoy the stealth to its fullest extent.  Its well worth the extra stealth talent points (also have the nightscape boots +1 stealth).  I don't get seen that often in BG when sneaking around.. and thats up against level 49's.<br />
I don't have any exciting gear, but almost everything I have is agi &amp; sta based.  I've never really played a restoration build or a balance build so I can't comment on that side of life.  I've focused on feral since day one.  I can wreck someone's day by run circles around them.  Its hard to keep up with druids.  I think it really irritates casters when I'm going in circles around them and they can't get a spell off.  <br />
I think feral has improved dramatically, but to have the most fun, you really have to change your gear for it.  I have found the AGI gear to be much more common at my levels right now, but not sure about later on.    At low levels, I felt I was forced into a feral spec due to lack of +int based leather armor.<br />
Overall, I can't get enough of my druid in PvP.<br />
In a PvE environment, I'm completely amazed at dire bear form.  I am now taking on up to 2-3 of any mob.  Most usually my level or one under.  It's quite sad when I compare my 46 druid to my 53 Warrior on another server.  I can tank more as a bear at 46 than I can with that 53.<br />
<br />
Have fun with your druids,<br />

Maybe you'd have lost if you two were in your 20s or 30s.  Or, maybe he would have beaten you.  All you had to do was back out, wait for a stun, and try regrowth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loved Omen of Clairity and doing more damage with my nukes.<br />
Since I respeced, I don't miss them at all however.<br />
<br />
Insta heal + Feral charge FTW!<br />
<br />
Cat form speed is awesome, and I can't wait to finish my + Crit % so I can get the extra rage on crits in Bear form.<br />
<br />
I can take a beating in bear form, and when you add frenzy regen, insta heal, and potion to that im extremely hard to take down.  <br />
<br />
Feral Charge is awesome.  Having the 10 rage when you shift is essential.  Having the 70% chance to not be interupted while casting heals has saved my life tons.  I have out healed pet speced hunter pets.<br />
<br />
My current plan is to be 30 Feral, 21 resto.  IMHO, insta heal and 70% no interupt &gt; 3% crit.<br />
<br />
I have gone entire AB runs without dying once, killing lots of people.<br />
<br />
If someone has a better pvp spec, I would like to hear about it.  Thus far, it is looking like 30 Feral, 21 Resto is really good.</div></div><hr />

Depending on the gear I use, I can still heal and whatnot, or I can shred faces in cat form or absorb dmg in bear. NS definitely helps a lot, and I probably would have some trouble if I didn't have it. Fun stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm assuming 0/30/21 is Balance/Resto/Feral (unless they changed the order of the tabs or my mind is going?).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm still building my Feral set, trying to push my AP and stamina up as much as possible, but struggling to find decent gear. I'm probably going to have to run the instances to pick up Shadowcraft for slots I can't fill.<br />
<br />
I wish Bliz would just make INT/SPI our Attack Power stats, would make my full Cenarion set worth something outside of PVE raids. Or at least let us use Nightslayer, Rogues would love that eh? hehe.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm pretty sure its bal/feral/resto. I like my NS and HotW is fantastic. I'm still working on getting my AP and crit rate up. Fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">trichor</div><div class="date">11-14-2005, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, some PVE notes.<br />
<br />
I tanked for the dog packs in MC recently and noticed this:<br />
(1) I took less damage than the other tanks<br />
(2) I did more damage than all 4 other warriors<br />
(3) My target never broke away from me<br />
<br />
I ran through Baron in cat form<br />
(1) I was #2 in damage, right behind the mage, ahead of the rogue.<br />
(2) I critted for 1953 with ravage, 1671 with FB, and 1011 with rake.<br />
(3) When I had to go to bear form and help tank/pull mobs off cloth, I had maul crits of over 900.<br />
<br />
I'm still a primary healer with my 11/31/9 build.<br />
(1) Usually middle of the healing charts<br />
(2) Usually do more damage than all other healers<br />
(3) I do pull aggro more though, even with just healing (damn, i need -20% threat)<br />
<br />
I do alright in PVP, though the lack of NS is a serious detriment.  I would say that a 0/30/21 build is probably the BEST PVP build for a druid right now.  But, running around with a group of rogues in AV or AB on mini gank-missions, we are unstoppable.  The +3% crit buffs their damage way up, and I can still heal them just fine, and go bear form to absorb damage and charge down fleeing priests :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i respecced to 30/21 recently and am also tanking like a champ, at least in nubbier places like dire maul west, where i lost aggro on the prince once during the fight, and in zg, where i can easily maintain aggro on boss adds.<br />
<br />
in pvp, i absolutely love that i now do enough dmg in bear form to be a significant threat.  maul is critting for close to 1000 on cloth wearers, and with crits giving me rage, i can basically use abilities nonstop.  swipe is awesome for stopping enemies from successfully gearing the flag.  HotW adds up to allowing me to heal more, take more dmg in bear, and dish out more in cat - i love it.</div></div><hr />

I think they were really surprised when I suddenly popped out of bear and warstomped them, then healed to full life. Then they started getting scared as I was not only preventing them from getting the flag, but was also killing them. XD</div></div><hr />
