I think a nice little enhancement to the PoP Graveyards would to not make the GY pop automatic.  Nothing like having part of a raid have their corpses pop back at the GY because it took a while to get a cleric back and rezed. <br />
<br />
Add an NPC at the GY that will summon your corpse for you.  You couldn't use him until the current pop timer had passed.  If you don't ask for the summon, your corpse stays where it is and you can get a rez.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes CR takes longer than gy pop time.  Also the inability to move a corpse out of a gy after its goes there sucks.  Maybe also a way to make it instant pop to gy if you are giving up instead of cring.</div></div><hr />
