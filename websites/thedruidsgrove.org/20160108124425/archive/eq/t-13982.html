I think you should just get 1.0, it's a simplish quest.. With all being soloable with the acception to one or 2 mobs, depending on your gear status, but even then, you can duo it with the tank/group that you were intending on doing the 1.5 prequest fights with.</div></div><hr />

I doubt looter matters, but I looted all with druid.</div></div><hr />
