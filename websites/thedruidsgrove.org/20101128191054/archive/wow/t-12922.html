You gear should focus on spellpower, crit, intellect, spirit (in that order). Of course stamina is always important, you should have enough that you can kill a few mobs comfortably without having to heal.<br />
<br />
But as long as you get your mobs killed, don't worry too much about gear. Just take what you can get from quests and get to level 58. Then, in Outland, you get the good stuff.<br />
<br />
As for talents, with level 34 try this build: http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=0000000000000000000000000000023000000000000  0000000000005032003025000000000000000000<br />
Next go for Insect Swarm, Celestial Focus, Lunar Guidance, Dreamstate. Get Moonkin Form as fast as possible, and Owlkin Frenzy next.</div></div><hr />
