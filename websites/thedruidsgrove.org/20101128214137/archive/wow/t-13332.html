Finally got crazy cat lady tonight (whore!!!). So reporting on the 3.1 bear tank performance, i really do feel like my bear is the best in overall survivability. I'm still primarily an OT, however there are several fights where our warrior MT, died too much and they throw me in (Ignis, Hodir, big guy on council, adds on freya??(still a work in progress). As soon as i'm in the problems stop all though I'll admit they had me using my max stam set from 3 drake.  warrior pally tanks out threat me noticably. Mostly since warriors started picking up that tanking relentless assault spec. <br />
<br />
I like using my agil set, especially with the new changes, but when tank survivability comes into question stam set ftw. On a side note for heroics though, i think i'm gonna stop using my tanking sets alltogether and just use my dps gear for the savage defence buff</div></div><hr />

Just one 15k fusion punch.<br />
<br />
If u like eating damage, you will like mimiron.<br />
17k fire-damage per second for 6 seconds for us bears. (not resistable -&gt; tried with FR-Gear)<br />
This is the encounter with most fast-healing needed until now.<br />
I think DKs will have it easier with there anti-magic-shell.<br />
Other than that.... scream for imba healers.<br />
<br />
I have 2 shadows in the raid, which use divine hymne for those 6 secs. The last one i do with my cooldowns.<br />
If u dont have the first-phase-boss down by this time, u will have problems as a druid. ;-)</div></div><hr />

It's 10man for me currently, so that explains the difference- :shuffle:</div></div><hr />

For bosses I will wear my normal set but for adds and learning fights I've been really rocking the whole 'Oh hai, 50,000hp' set.  -_-;  It makes me feel sorta cheap and dirty but it gets the job done.  <br />
<br />
I did take back my 'You suck Savage Defense' when I did Heroic Occulus in like...16 minutes and barely took any damage.  I had thrown on some DPS items though and that shield does stay up quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Also yeah, Iron Council guy hits like a truck on 25.  35,000 damage fusion punches.  &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">04-23-2009, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think when plate tanks get ulduar gear it will be more advantageous for them. some of their helms have 200 stam without sockets or enhants. And yeah SD is so OP in heroics, but then again, take a best in slot plate tank and his shield is OP too. <br />
<br />
On a side note on 25man thorim tonight, i felt like a pally tank spamming my swipe. it was amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-23-2009, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sytaera, take a careful look at bear gear from Uldaur.  Your HP is as high now as it will every be.  Warriors and Pallies are steadily scaling up in EH with the new gear, the bear gear is a massive reduction in stam (~30% reduction in most pieces vs T7.5/i213).  <br />
<br />
Also, you are discounting the fact that in a stam sets, bears simply can't keep up with TPS.  You may be ok at the moment while DPS is still learning, dying, positioning...but once they know what they are doing and opening up, you aren't going to be able to hold anything.  <br />
<br />
The point was to get us bears out of our stam sets and into normal tanking gear.  We are no doubt the best at &quot;one sided&quot; tanking.  Meaning we can fulfill any single focus (Stam, Dodge, crit, Resistance sets...etc) but we are without a doubt the weakest &quot;all around&quot; tank.<br />

Swipe is godly, and will be nerfed...I'm callin' it!</div></div><hr />

The swipe gods can't let this happen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sytaera</div><div class="date">04-24-2009, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually yeah, as I keep looking at the gear from Ulduar I'm sorta like '...wtf' to be perfectly honest.   I'm not 100% pleased with the itemization and even less pleased that the tanking idol drops from the second to last boss in heroic Ulduar.  Le sigh.  <br />
<br />
Also yes, swipe is going to be nerfed.  Which makes me sad because right now it's sorta ridiculously awesome.</div></div><hr />
