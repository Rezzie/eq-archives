I am trying to download the expansion off the website, I paid for it, but I cannot find the link in my receipt email or on the websites. Does anyone know how I can download the expansions since I already have an account and I am all paid up now?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It's been a while, but I think I had to get the Station Launcher (should be on Sony's site) and download the game through there.  I'm betting EQ1 is the same now as well - they were trying to make it a universal launcher I think.</div></div><hr />

It is sad to see that The Druids Grove had so many people posting years ago, but like anything, times change. I loved reading everyones point of view. <br />
Well.....I am sure I will be choked up camping Orc 1 and Orc 2 in the now Commonloands, if the Orc camps still exist, I miss old Freeport though, I miss camping poor Guard Jendl at the zone to North Freeport......but I could not take the immature behavior in WoW anymore.<br />
I hope more folks come back to EQ.</div></div><hr />
