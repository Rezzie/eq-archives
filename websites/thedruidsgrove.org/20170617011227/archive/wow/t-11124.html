<br />
This is probably a stupid question, but I've hit Level 20 and can't acquire cat form. So how do I get it?<br />
Someone said that you buy it from a druid trainer, but I don't seem to be able to?<br />
Is it anything to do with being on a trial account, I know level 20 is the highest you're allowed to reach?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance :)</div></div><hr />

It was like 2 years ago I did it so I don't really remember. :(</div></div><hr />

You learn cat form from the same trainer as you learn your spells.  There is no quest.  I am not certain what kinds of restraints you have with a trial account.  Were you able to learn other level 20 skills at the trainer??</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont know if it matters which druid trainer you goto or not, but i believe i trained cat form from one of the 2 druid trainers in thunder bluff at lvl 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would think this Cat has some purpose? I.E. training for Cat form or something.</div></div><hr />

If I am not mistaken in one of the betas that spirit was used for that purpose however, they cut it for some reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or maybe after they developed the seal quest they said, screw it, just give them cat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I have the answer if you haven't figured it out yet.  I am almost 100% sure you WILL have to speak to the trainer in Moonglade...the one who you spoke to about the bear form. (up in the cottage thingy)  Please let us know when you find out for sure.</div></div><hr />
