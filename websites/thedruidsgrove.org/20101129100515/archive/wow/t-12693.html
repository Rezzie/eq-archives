<br />
I made a macro like this:<br />
<br />
/assist Rage Winterchill<br />
/cast Regrowth<br />
<br />
Expecting that he would change targets when he casts icebolt and I would just stare at his target window until he did.  And I did wait until he quickly switched to a target and reacted, quick as a rabbit.<br />
<br />
However... looking at the log I don't think I managed to heal more than one or two people who got Icebolted.<br />
<br />
Good grief, what am I doing wrong?  Only thing I can think is that he doesn't really change targets to cast that spell.</div></div><hr />

He most certainly does change targets, but I really don't think that an assist macro is the best way to heal Icebolt because you have to be really, really fast (the cast time is instant).<br />
<br />
Hopefully your RL is using an addon that will put a raid icon on the person who got Icebolted.  That's how I know who to heal.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
And like Pookies said, make sure your raid leader is using some form of deadly boss mods or something that'll put a skull over the icebolted person and say in raid warning &quot;Zute is Icebolted&quot;<br />
 <br />
As far as macro's go, I'd think that a target of target macro would be better than an assist one, but I don't know.</div></div><hr />

To drive it all home, someone will also call out who has been Icebolted so that all healers within range can throw a heal on that raid member.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also found something else, apparently you can set up custom debuff indicator in Grid.  I'm going to try that next time and make one for Icebolt.  There are the little skull icons too, but they're super tiny on my grid display, I need them to be bigger.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />
