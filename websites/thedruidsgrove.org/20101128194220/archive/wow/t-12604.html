<br />
After a couple years (or a bit more) I'm taking another look at WoW since it seems to be a game with a fair bit of cap level content and I've had trouble with this in EQ2 and lotro.<br />
<br />
I have a level 42 druid that was &quot;retired&quot; will before TBC, I think around patch 1.8.  At the time he was decently geared and I had spent the time running all the level appropriate instances to get whatever drops I thought were reasonable upgrades.<br />
<br />
At the time I'm pretty sure I was feral specced.<br />
What I'm wondering is will my gear be completely obsolete or is it just the higher level stuff the TBC made obsolete with mudflation?  If the gear has been made obsolete would I be better off just re-rolling again?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, what UI mods do druids use these days?  I had a fairly extensive set &quot;back in the day&quot; but have no idea which one's would be considered good now.  I don't want the &quot;click on button to do everything for me&quot; type mobs, just the addons that gave me things like harvest node locations,  quick form switching, etc....<br />
Can anyone recommend a good suite?</div></div><hr />

What I'm wondering is will my gear be completely obsolete or is it just the higher level stuff the TBC made obsolete with mudflation?The gear will be fine for a lvl 42 Druid.:grin: As you level your gear will be replaced quickly.  And even more so once you reach the Outlands (as early as lvl 58).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely.  And when you get to Outland you will be quite pleased with the quality of drops you will be receiving.  Not simply from quest rewards, either.  I've received some pretty crazy drops from random kills just clearing my path to a herb!<br />
<br />
As for add-ons...depending on your eventual spec, it's your personal preferance.  <br />
<br />
Cartographer is great while leveling.  Also, Gatherer is very useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also something like auctioneer for price tracking and price history's ?<br />
<br />
omen as well probably when you are a big higher and start doing more 5 mans...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyin</div><div class="date">05-16-2008, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the replies.<br />
I think I restarted at a bad time addon wise since I have been getting errors while trying to use gatherer and cartographer.<br />
Hopefully will see updates soon.<br />
<br />
I logged on to my druid last night and ran around like a idiot switching form etc... trying to remember my skills/abilities.<br />
I'm on a PvP server so just can't step out and start beating on mobs tying while to relearn skills without a lot of pain and suffering.<br />
I ran to the safely of BFD and beat on the grey elites trying to remember my ability rotation and the like.<br />
<br />
Being away from the game has really messed me up in areas like backup gear etc...  I have a set up backup healing gear in my bags (&quot;voodoo&quot; set I think plus a weapon and jewelery) and I need to take a close look at everything and cull what I don't need.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I am having fun so far and thanks for the reasurance that I can probably survive with my current gear while leveling up looking for upgrades.<br />
<br />
Now I really need to look at my spec since I had to respec when I logged on and am not sure I put everything exactly where I want it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You too?  I'm glad it's not just me.  In fact, I've since turned off Cartographer and Gatherer hoping they will be fixed during the next scheduled maintenance.<br />
<br />
As for your Druid, I hope you stick with it.  Honestly, I absolutely love my Druid.  I have &quot;dabbled&quot; with other toons, but she is my only 70 and I'm happy spending all my time with her.  :rose: <br />
<br />
And as for feeling like you don't know what you are doing?  HA! I still don't know what I'm doing!  :wavey:  <br />
<br />
I'm not lying when I tell you that I discover something new about this game daily.  So, don't be afraid to ask anything here on the grove.....trust me.....I've asked some pretty goofy questions, and not once have I been made to feel awkward about them. ;)</div></div><hr />

Ya, mine works, but if there is any money on the mob, the error pops up as I loot and tells me it doesn't recognize copper.  (or something to that effect)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the suggestions and your build recommendations have made me feel better about my choices.  I'm actually 43 and not 42 like I originally thought..<br />
I've taken exactly what you have suggested except I've grabbed Feral Charge (absolutely needed in PvP from what I remember) and savage fury and haven't worked all the way to OoC.<br />
I will spend the next points in the resto tree as you have suggested but am tempted to try nurturing instinct first since it will (will it?) remove some of the need to keep 2 sets of gear while leveling.<br />
<br />
And to a previous poster whether I played a druid again was not in question, it was whether I just started over again to relearn the abilities on the way up.</div></div><hr />

Guess it might help in BG type PvP.  While it may be possible, I doubt it would help all that much as a healer while leveling.  FWIW, 16 slot bags are basically free (my guild has a to have a dozen or so in the guild bank) so space shouldn't be an issue.  Especially since you probably won't have a full set for each spec.  In fact, I think I only had 4-8 healing pieces until I was in my late 60's.  And maybe a few +sta and +armor pieces (for tanking) until I reached my 60's as well.  Today I have 4 sets (some overlap between kitty, bear and pvp) all  in 2 18 slot bags (wear one, 2 in the bags, plus a few PvP only pieces).<br />
<br />
Continue in Resto until you get OoC, then finish up Feral until you get Mangle at lvl 62 (or 63).  From then on the points are more fine tuning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyin</div><div class="date">05-17-2008, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey update,<br />
<br />
I &quot;bit the bullet&quot; and went off to a quiet place where I could relearn my abilities etc...<br />
I've had a blast so far.  Leveled up to 47 and enjoying it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyin</div><div class="date">05-20-2008, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here I am for more advice...<br />
<br />
One of the things that I have found to have changed in the game since I left it is the general population now knows we can tank decently.  I used to get laughed at when I would offer to tank.<br />
I remember healing a lot and running dps sometimes but never tanking.<br />
<br />
What I am after are some pointers on tanking so I don't look like a total noob to the group I am in.  I've got some experience tanking in EQ1 and EQ2 but in those games fights are all about control, not chaos.<br />
<br />
What I do now, when there is more than one mob since anyone can tank a single mob, is Feral charge and if there is no CC I switch between targets hitting maul and taunt.  I usually save bash to interupt casting or stop a running mob unless I think I need to use it for agro.<br />
The problem I have is that in a group with no CC I asked someone else to designate themselves MA because I would be switching targets a lot during fights and the group didn't understand what I was talking about so I haven't even asked another group to do this.  Is it not normal to have a MT and MA designated?  With a MA I can concentrate primarily on keeping agro on his/her mob, switch targets if need be to maintain agro of the others, and easily switch back to the MA mob while the entire group concentrates on killing mobs one at a time.<br />
Should I just concentrate on the main mobs and let the group handle the ones that &quot;get away&quot; or should I be chasing down the strays too?<br />
<br />
In EQ2 I usually ask the group for a few seconds to generate agro on a group before they start beating on the mobs but I have found that people here are normally casting on the mobs before they even get to me if I happen to pull with farie fire and since I haven't been playing for a long time I don't know if people will understand when I ask this.<br />
<br />
I would much rather play a cat dps/bu heal/protect the healer role but it seems every time I get a invite it is for tanking, so I better get good at it.<br />
<br />
Long post but basically I'm after a few pointers from a perspective of someone (level 50) who still doesn't have then mangle or lacerate abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">05-20-2008, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, in a 5-man the tank should be the leader so they can mark targets with raid symbols (skull, X, etc.) (http://www.wowwiki.com/Raid_target_icons).  Use them to mark targets for CC and the kill order.  Assign an easy to reach key (&quot;`&quot; [next to the 1 key] is ideal) to the &quot;Skull&quot; symbol.  Once your group has killed the original skull, you pick the next target (typically marked with an X before the pull) and put the &quot;Skull&quot; over it.  The group will know they should target the skull.  That should cover your issues with MT and MA.  I don't see a need for a MA in a 5-man.  It is more of a 10/25-man role.<br />
<br />
Regarding tanking in general.  Here are a few articles on the subject.  Most assume you have lacerate and mangle, so you will have to just ignore those abilities until you have them.  For multiple mobs swipe (hits 3 nearby targets at once) is what you need to use as long as you are not near CC'd mobs.  And continue to use Maul on your primary target (skull) when your rage is above 40-60.  Maul is a double-edge sword in that it generates a lot of threat, but you lose more rage when you use it than what the tooltip says.  As it replaces your next white damage hit.  It is your white damage and damage you take that generates your rage.  So, don't use maul unless you have plenty of rage.  Though I often use it as my first attack on boss fights as I know they are going to pound me and replace the rage quite quickly.<br />

There is also a brief guide somewhere on this forum.  I'll update this post after I find it.<br />
<br />
Found it.  The message you are looking for is here (http://wow.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showpost.php?p=145306&amp;postcount=6) it happens to be buried in a vaguely titled thread (http://wow.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=11863).<br />
<br />
Also, if you think you are going to be a tank, I highly recommend that you start planning your CE Rep (http://wow.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=12571) now (start buying 360 under priced Unidentified Plant Parts (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24401) off the AH).

You are right that if I use marks I can avoid the whole MA thing.<br />
<br />
From reading a lot of this I think one of my main issues has been with people attacking the mobs before I even get to them to start building any kind of agro and I hate, repeat hate, chasing mobs all over the place because the ranged dps isn't being patient enough.</div></div><hr />

The good ones know that waiting a few seconds before starting is the best way to insure success.  As a kitty, I often start fights in prowl even though I have no intention of using pounce (or ravage), just so I let the tank build some threat before I start.  I do the same with my hunter.  Wait a few seconds.  Send in my pet (Growl off!!!).  Wait a couple more seconds, start firing away.<br />
<br />
FWIW, you may find it is the healer that has the itchy finger.  If they start spamming heals too early, things can, and often do, get ugly real fast.</div></div><hr />

I've run through instances where everyone stayed on marked targets and it when smoothly.<br />
I've also run through an instance where the hunter is hitting multishot and everyone is choosing their own mob to play with before I even get to the mobs.  Then it doesn't go quite so smoothly.  Everyone is so worried about their dps parse that they don't want to stick to single mobs.  They would rather burst dps and require loads of healing and wait for the healer to drink after every fight.</div></div><hr />

LOL - Guilty.  <br />

I was pulling my keyboard closer to myself during a Flesh Beast pull (just after Chess - just before Prince) and accidently hit one of my healing keys (I had the tank targeted, of course).  I've never seen anything change direction so fast.  As it barrelled towards me, I swear it was grinning. :grin:</div></div><hr />
