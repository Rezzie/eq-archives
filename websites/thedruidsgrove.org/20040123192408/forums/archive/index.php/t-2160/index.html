<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xytrani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been asking in tdg serverwide channel the past few days about this quest.<br />
<br />
I've found that there are 4 different classes of diaku that you must kill for each emblem. <br />
<br />
I have the emblems from the Shadow Knight, the Shaman, and I believe a Rogue since he wore chain and was pure melee. <br />
<br />
The final class that I am lacking is the warrior I have been told. Now I have been told that the warrior wears plate. I have also read on allakhazam that only the shadow knight wears plate and that the other 3 are chain classes.<br />
<br />
Has anyone found any surefire ways to get these guys to spawn with any regularity? I have logged about 15 hours in the desert killing rocks since I picked up my 3rd emblem with no sign of this warrior diaku in over 40 diaku spawns.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, you can solo them. I'm unsure on whether they summon, I killed a few of them pre-charm nerf using a frog pet. My strategy was to snare/tash a frog in the forest, then drag it over through the tunnel to the desert. I'd then charm it when on the desert side of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Then, depending on where the diaku is, there might be a good place to set up camp, might not. Usually if you use Harmony of Nature on the mobs surrounding the diaku (the diaku is immune), and time your pulling right, you can pull out the diaku solo with no problem.<br />
<br />
If you do get adds, use Savage Root and park them somewhere while you kill the diaku.<br />
<br />
Xytrani - I didn't kill them that often.. can't give you any accurate information on that. Best thing to do is probably keep killing the trash, and hope they spawn. Good luck with it, keep us posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xytrani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Finished this quest a while ago, but havn't gotten a chance to post up yet. <br />
<br />
The said reality is that I never killed this final diaku and never got the missing piece. <br />
<br />
So what happened? How did I finish?<br />
<br />
Well I went into PoS and said I was MQing a tactics falg to anyone who had the piece I was missing. Within 6 seconds i got a tell from a necro who told me he had just looted the piece off the first diaku he had ever seen.<br />
<br />
Imagine my displeasure knowing I had put in hours and hours hunting diaku and had killed many diaku before even seeing my first quarter of an emblem drop to find he had the piece I had spent weeks looking for because he saw it up. I mean he doesn't even have track!<br />
<br />
Oh well, the quest is MQable. Just identify your pieces and have someone else identify theirs, group up and hand in. IT is really sick to find that the random generators are just that messed up, but what can you do?<br />
<br />
In closing, I went to tactics to xp and in my first 15 mobs got a highly polished gem for a bloodmetal earring. Did I hate the diaku camp? With a passion. Was it worth it? No, but only because someone from sony may be reading this board and I want them to focus on my displeasure of their random generators :)  <br />
<br />
EDIT: So sorry, forgot some key info to answer an above post. No these do not summon, but the problem is that their PHs either a) summon and flurry or b) don't summon but nuke for over 2.5k, possibly a PvP style manaburn. So pretty much solo you are only killing diakus that are currently up. Not saying that it isn't possible to solo the rocks in the desert, but they hit relatively hard o try and heal between summons while keep dots going and all the animals you charm in the desert summon. You can always bring over a frog, but getting summoned between a hasted frog hitting for 636 and a flurrying rock hitting for 400-500 is not nice. Pull the diakus to the caves on either side of the desert, but watch for pathing as they depop is stuck in a wall. Be careful of the shammy diaku (wears chain and casts). He is the only one that could possibly present a problem as Malo, Pox, Bane and his Ice Based nuke could very quickly ruin your day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jarilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for all the info so far.  I have just started this quest and have only one amulet part - from the Shaman Daiku I believe.  I also killed the Rogue Daiku but he did not drop an amulet part.  Anyway, I thought that I had read somewhere that the ph's for the Daiku were the &quot;a rock storm&quot; mobs in the desert in PoS.  I finally found one that I could pull without adds and brought it to the zone wall to kill.  I rooted it there and it started nuking me.  I had resists up but it still landed for almost 2400 hps - ouch!  I did not stick around to see if it was a manaburn type of effect or not, I bugged out with Exodus.<br />
<br />
Basically I wanted to see if this mob is the correct ph for the Daiku.  If they are, then I'll take the risk and work on killing them, if not can you let us know the correct ph?  Any other info on soloing these would be appreciated as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Milwein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm. I knew there were different classes of daiku but didn't know that each class drops a different quarter. I thought they were all just random if they dropped and then random which quarter it will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">From what I understand, only the chain wearing SK diaku drop one quadrant.<br />
<br />
The rest is random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The nasty spell the rock storms use isn't manaburn, it's Shock of Magic, a level 65 wizard spell:<br />
lucy.fnord.net/spell.html...ource=Live (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3191&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
It does a random amount of damage from 1200 to 3000.  It checks magic+20, so in theory it should be easy to resist, but it does land some of the time.<br />
<br />
Sea giants use it too, even though both the sea giants and rock storms are both under level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jarilon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I toughed it out and fought another one last night and took it down without too much trouble.  I resisted many of it's nukes but still had some land.  I was very glad that I just recently bought Nature's Infusion :) <br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the original question, can anyone confirm that these are the ph's for the Daiku?  Also, are they only for a certain type of Daiku?  Are only certain ones (i.e. static mobs) the ph's for the Daiku or are they on the same spawn tables as wandering mobs?  I'm just trying to maximize my time and energy when working on this quest.  Any help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />
