<br />
If anyone has experience as a moonkin and a tree please tell me your experience soloing as a resto spec. Currently I have a hard time since I cant use roots indoors or use cyclone (lv 62)and i have to shift out of moonkin and then my spells get interrupted.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that my playstyle involves mostly pvp and questing.... but i hate getting flak for being a moonkin. The other day I had to tell my party 3 times that I wasnt a tank before they got the idea.<br />
<br />
Which spec is better for taking on multiple targets?<br />
<br />
How noticable is the damage reduction by speccing resto?<br />
<br />
Is it easy to stay alive when being pummeled?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Damage reduction is pretty much.<br />
<br />
3. Pummeled? You are a HoT-healer so u use mostly instants<br />
<br />
4. If your priorities are questing and pvp then i would either go feral or balance. Resto is such a pain in questing cause of the time you need to kill mobs.</div></div><hr />

Tru Dat.  <br />
<br />
If Resto is your inevitable dream, I strongly recommend completing all your Outland quests before you re-spec to the &quot;ever awesome&quot; Druid Healer.</div></div><hr />

Its slower but you can't die. 3-4 starfires + moonfie kills pretty much any 70 mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">04-17-2008, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm resto.  Never had issues killing things at level 70 in my healing gear.  I use Nature's Grasp a fair amount when soloing or sometime NS and root, cyclone from time to time.  I have 19 points into Balance, the rest in Resto.<br />
<br />
I've started to accumulate moonkin gear and slap it on when soloing, that helps a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">04-18-2008, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have also never had problems soloing all of my daily quests.  Nature's Grasp/Imp. Nature's Grasp isn't even a requirement.  Control of Nature is nice, but also not a requirement.  Just use Engtangling Roots to keep the enemy at range, and nuke, nuke, nuke.<br />
<br />
What poses a much bigger threat than any mob is the opposing faction if you're on a PVP server ... I have to quest in my PVP gear which decreases my bonus damage by 100 - 200 ... :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have really noticed the same thing ... when I'm soloing I very rarely pop Nature's Grasp, because I want to try to root them BEFORE they hit me.<br />
<br />
I still use Nature's Grasp a ton in PVP though ... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Organtis</div><div class="date">04-19-2008, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah i definately am going to wait till 70 and see how it goes. I realized im 63 and just soloing and havent done an instance since lv 60 so I'm at least going balance till 70. In addition to that I'm afraid of how questing inside will be like without treants, roots, or cyclone.   Thanks for the info</div></div><hr />

Im heading the same route. Im currently lvl 67 and specc'd for Boomkin. I have started to replace my boomkin gear with healing gear. This way I can still have enough Boom to get thru questing and then heal most 5-mans. <br />
Even with my gear set up as it is. I have a  lot of Boom. I would love to see just how much I could crit for if I was in better gear. <br />
My healer side of me can crit HT for 5k. I have moved away from using HT much. I just roll LB's and Rev's If I get behind I toss a Regrowth. <br />
There is a ton of good healer gear between your lvl and 67. I just couldnt turn it down. <br />
<br />
This is just my 2 copper. Take it as you will.</div></div><hr />
