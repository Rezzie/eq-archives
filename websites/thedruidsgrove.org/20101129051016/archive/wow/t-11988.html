<br />
i went in last night with a shammy friend that is resto spec'c<br />
<br />
basicaly got our arse handed to use was like 1-1-9  yeah bad i know, for a first time around not to bad.  i could deffinatly tell the difference with gear and how that effected the matches.<br />
<br />
anyone got some pointers?<br />
<br />
oh yeah the only match we won... we were up against a druid / sham team just like ours.  lasted about 10 minutes, enough time to pop my barov trinket twice<br />
<br />
oh yeah... ---&gt; http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Dark+Iron&amp;n=Weasely  armory if it maters</div></div><hr />

<br />
That bracer enchant has to go :P I see druids with the AP enchants all the time and can't for the life of me figure out why. Get the +12 str bracer enchant, same mats, and you get so much more out of it...plus it scales with Blessing of Kings.<br />
<br />
If you're teamed with a resto shaman, then you're the only source of offense really, not sure if you mean to link tanking gear, but alot of the stuff you're using has no offensive benefit at all. Clefthoof stuff etc...<br />
<br />
Especially if you're fighting caster groups, try to target something in cloth and take it down. Anything the shaman can do to interrupt the other groups healer(if they have one) is gravy..or if they're slow to heal for whatever reason, bust up your target, cyclone the healer and try to finish off the other.<br />
<br />
2v2 without some form of reliable CC(fear, poly, etc) is pretty reliant on creative ways to &quot;CC&quot; someone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the shammy respect to ele on the last 2 fights.  those was came away with a win and a draw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In kitty toss a pounce, get another combo point, when they come out hit them with Maim, pop out to caster form and hit them with a Cyclone.<br />
<br />
By the end of the cyclone the other opponent should (and I stress &quot;should&quot;) be dead and then you sit back and heal the Shaman and toss on a couple Moonfires and Wraths when you can.<br />
<br />
Against most teams this should work as an Elemental Shaman should be able to take most classes down pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

Have made paladins so sick of the interrupts that they bubble 15 seconds into a fight(which is a win imo).<br />
<br />
Especially as a feral, you have lots of tools to play with. Pounce/Maim as was said, cyclone, back to feral charge, warstomp if you're tauren, cyclone again, maim again, bash, cyclone, feral charge...it's really evil sometimes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
stealth.. of course<br />
<br />
pounce, <br />
shred, <br />
shred, (if clearcast pops get a 3rd shred)<br />
maim,<br />
shift to normal<br />
shift to bear<br />
bash<br />
shift to normal<br />
shift to cat<br />
shred<br />
shred<br />
<br />
if he isn't dead by then somethings wrong<br />
<br />
but thats based on my current build<br />
<br />
also a key thing my sham and i have is we both pop the barov as soon as we get first contact for melee.  this gives use enough time with 6 servents in the ring with us to inturupt spell cast most of the time</div></div><hr />
