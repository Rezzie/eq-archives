I'm looking to use my Druid to PL a Ranger.  There is a really nice faction quest in So Ro near the beach that lets you raise your Freeport faction and also level up a newbie using a kill count quest.  I'm looking for quests like this that might ease the way to L65, then L70.  Any idea's where I might find a guide, or do any of you have any tips I might try?   Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't either.  I spent an hour or two going through the Alla database of quests and eye'd all of the Excellent rated quests I happened to bump into.  The camine quest was listed as excellent and the posts raved about the nice xp, but that's only enough to get you to L19-ish.  Then what?<br />
<br />
Finding a nice repeatable quest for later levels would be nice.  If I just wanted to pure PL, I'll pull up to a camp of mobs that don't run in some hot-spot zone and go to work.</div></div><hr />

Monster missions can be obtained by a group of at least 3 people. Currently very popular ones are in icewell and the names are Dain 1, 2 and 3. You can easily find a group there (unless you are KOS to the ice dwarves). Dain 3 can give more than one AA of experience at level 70 for 45 minutes of work. Plus there is no penalty if you die in an MM.</div></div><hr />

Druid is L70 with about 10k/ 10k and FT capped -- serveral hundred AA.  My Druid is only 5k/5k, so I'm borrowing a friends to PL.  The Ranger is now L36...was not created when I first posted.  <br />

I have him in Mistmore at the moment.  I pull the castle -- about 10 - 15 mobs and thorn them down on the Druid.  After a few self heals, nothing pulls them off the Druid.  Then I work quickly as I can to stab each one best I can with the Ranger.  I miss a few, but XP is good.<br />
<br />
I put the Ranger in the group and AEd a few at L35 but the Ranger got no XP.  Haven't tried it at L36, yet.  What level does the Ranger have to be get XP with a level 70?  Does the L70 Druid have to kill mobs that will give him [the Druid] XP in order for the Ranger to also get XP?<br />

Oh, it is and that's exactly what I'm doing now...sort of.  I'm just trying to be as efficient as possible.  PLing is a game in itself and one I enjoy emensely.  If there are new tricks, I'd love to learn them.  Should be L50 by this Sunday if I can manage the play time.  I'm thinking about going back and doing a Beast Lord + a Mage group together PL'd by the same Druid as well.  Fun, fun.</div></div><hr />

I did Xalgoz area of Kaesora until about 35 (can do it to 40 np if your char doesnt have any type of lure nuke). I then did the Hole until 50 and then got my alt fire flagged and just FD'd him while I aa'd.<br />
 <br />
You max DS yourself (With shaman fire pot, Yar'lir ring and best DS's I was getting 150 np.) Snare pull 1 then nuke with ranger, then snare pull another, etc. I killed crusaders myself, not worth the hassle and the ele's wont run till its last one. Just did a loop through castle to the huge golems then evac back to start and go again. Its boring but was fastest way to do it.<br />
 <br />
*edit*<br />
Another place I did was Katta,  I would wait until the Hole really started slowing down,  Katta will stay DB till 60 to DS PL (Which IMO is superior to grouping PL if you can find a place to chain it).  The only thing with Katta is that every half hour the guards would suddenly despawn and respawn at thier spawn locs back at full health,  but once you get the timing down its about 13-15 mobs every 10 mins.  Pull the 6+1 up staircase for 1 pull,  then pull the 2 shortie caves + patrollers (7-8) and by time your done first ones are going to spawn soon.</div></div><hr />

Have to go to lunch and class, but I'm highly inclined to believe 46 is the lowest level at this point.  Will try to post back later with proof, unless someone else can post definitive proof sooner.  <br />

Formula in theory is ([PL'd players level] x 1.5) + 1 = max level to get exp with.</div></div><hr />

PLee lvl x 1.5 works 95%+ of the time but 2/3 PLer level gets you the real deal. In this case you get 46.6666666 (repeating of course). EQ rounds that down to 46. <br />
 <br />
The test after next month will be to see if a lvl 49 will get xp with a lvl 74.<br />
 <br />
As for where to go....the last time I PLed a toon I did a lot in ToFS. At the time it was a hotzone and went resonably fast. I want to say I started ~35 and took it to 46 just because the end was in sight and could group at that point. After level 40 or so I was on the floor just under the very top (the one with the dogs near zone in).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lotharun</div><div class="date">08-23-2006, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be able to test it by the weekend.  The Ranger is L41 now -- not bad for a few days of casual PLing.  I'm still playing my Druid on the side so I don't have as much time to dedicate to this project as I'd like.  The progress thus far, though, has been highly encouraging.<br />
<br />
I'm in CoM right now PLing with 6-8 mobs at a time.  These mobs are hitting the Druid hard enough that I really have to pay attention to his health.  I'm looking forward to getting the Ranger to L45 or L46 to try AE.  Shouldn't be much longer.  I'm using one box to PL and not using EQwindows.  This is making it increasingly harder to time those heals as the levels and the stakes raise.<br />
<br />
My PL method:<br />
I used the tutorial quests to level 11 [this was for fun not PL] then Camine quest in So Ro for the early levels then over to Mistmore.  I used the handy group invis and parked the Ranger safely out of harms way.  I buffed the Ranger with skin, str, sow, thorns and a regen.  I used the same low level thorns on the Druid so the mobs wouldn't die too fast.  <br />
<br />
Note: Call of the wild is really nice for the those occasional ooops, you have while PLing.  Really don't need a rezz at low levels.  Just revive and go.  A few kills later and you're back to where you were.<br />
<br />
The Druid would go off and prox-aggro between 8 and 15 mobs [whatever I could find] and drag them back to a corner somewhere near the Ranger.  I use a corner to prevent too much pushing.  I'd sit/stand then heal to generate a large amount of aggro.  Do this enough and nothing short of pressing the taunt key is going to pull the aggro off the Druid and on to the Ranger.  I nuked down any healers as they can really slow down the PL process.  When I get down to two mobs, I snare them both to prevent a runner bringing adds. <br />
<br />
I haphazardly try and hit each mob once or twice to get the XP.  It's a balance between generating enough aggro on the Druid and switching over to the Ranger fast enough to tag every mob before they die to thorns.  Admittedly, I'm not real good at selecting the mob I want to hit.  One big blob of mobs and I want the one in the middle!  Ocasionally I have to remove the thorns buff off the Druid if the mobs health are decreasing faster than I can tag them all with the Ranger.  Sometimes I just don't get every mob tagged -- probably 90% I do.<br />
<br />
I've since found the PL post in the strat section.  PLing hasn't changed much over the years.  I had hoped that with the new content came new clever ways to PL but it appears that the tried and true methods are still the best.  That or someone isn't sharing. ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no EQ windows.  I need to take care of that problem.  Maybe tonight. :)<br />
<br />
I tried Reptile in Mistmore.  It went away right after I cast it.  Wasn't sure what exactly it does, but I'm assuming that it is some sort of Rune based DS.  The DS isn't my problem right now towards efficiency, it's:<br />
a) keeping aggro on the Druid, not the Ranger.<br />
b) making sure I tag each mob before DS kills it.<br />
c) don't pull so few mobs that I don't max efficiency of the Druids hitpoints and mana pool.<br />
d) making sure I don't kill the Druid while using the Ranger to tag mobs<br />
<br />
I've killed the Druid once so far, so no big deal but as I take on a bigger mobs this becomes a higher concern.  I'm not using the highest DS I have on the Druid right now either since I'm still having trouble getting the mobs all tagged before they die.</div></div><hr />

A great thing to knock out early is getting the OT gate hammer while you still get good xp for it + OT is a hotzone. Two birds and all that. The great thing is these guys have a 6 min respawn or close to. If you are coming from FM side there is a set of 3 buildings clumped together holding 9 or 10 of them. If I take them 3 at a time the first group is just about to respawn. Need 88 war braids from the zerker types and that turn in is worth a nice bit of xp as well.</div></div><hr />

I used to use EQW and switched to WinEQ and never turned back.  Its so much better.  Get 2.0 lite,  its free and works great.<br />
 <br />
I tried Reptile in Mistmore. It went away right after I cast it. Wasn't sure what exactly it does, but I'm assuming that it is some sort of Rune based DS.<br />
 <br />
Its a heal proc,  it should be good for quite a few hits and helps in the early pull so you dont have to stop to heal yourself as long as you already have decent HP/AC.  (I was 10k/2k.)<br />
 <br />
a) keeping aggro on the Druid, not the Ranger.<br />
 <br />
Have your ranger use a low lvl nuke,  and hunt in places where mobs are not insanely resistant.  The remake of CoM made the mobs much tougher.  Velks is great but very camped (got a routine where I would pull mobs 5-6 at a time going through all ramp camps and by time I got to start again they'd be respawned.)  I pulled single with snare,  it would take 3-4 casts before my chanter drew agro away.<br />
 <br />
b) making sure I tag each mob before DS kills it.<br />
 <br />
Just pull them 1-2 at a time,  again this works better with EQW as you can practically tab between accounts.<br />
 <br />
c) don't pull so few mobs that I don't max efficiency of the Druids hitpoints and mana pool.<br />
 <br />
As your alt gets higher lvl efficiency will start to drop,  by time I was doing velks/hole/katta I couldnt pull near as many because they start hitting harder,  faster and have more HP.  Katta is my last resort because its smallest exp per mob and they have alot of HP,  i'd only ever go there if velks and hole were both packed as nobody goes to Katta.  Velks/hole I could handle 10-15 at a time,  using reptile and on bigger pulls I would use heal/ds aa and healing potions.<br />
 <br />
d) making sure I don't kill the Druid while using the Ranger to tag mobs<br />
 <br />
Hot healing pots are your friend,  ive had a couple of very close calls when I pull a tad too many and get inturrupted in velks.  ;P<br />
 <br />
I failed to mention velks earlier,  but if its not busy or ramps are clear then its prob best exp until 55 np,  can even take to 60 somewhat quickly (faster then grouping unless you can get your alt PoFire flagged and just quad there.)  Prob is 1 person can dominate the ramps np,  so all it takes is 1 or 2 such persons and the exp drops dramatically.  The hole is less so because you have more places you can pull from,  Katta is limited too with only about 20-22 mobs but they respawn quick and again,  I think ive only seen 1 person ever there to buy something in all my time solo'n.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for bringing this up.  The reason Kunark and old world zones are so good for PLing is that mobs in these zones don't have an overwhelming number of hitpoints.<br />
<br />
 <br />
Hot healing pots are your friend.<br />
<br />
Great tip.  I'm doing this ghetto.  If the Druid is still raid buffed then I take advantage of that otherswise I self buff and go.<br />
<br />
 <br />
I failed to mention velks earlier,  but if its not busy or ramps are clear then its prob best exp until 55 np,  can even take to 60 somewhat quickly (faster then grouping unless you can get your alt PoFire flagged and just quad there.)  Prob is 1 person can dominate the ramps np,  so all it takes is 1 or 2 such persons and the exp drops dramatically.  The hole is less so because you have more places you can pull from,  Katta is limited too with only about 20-22 mobs but they respawn quick and again,  I think ive only seen 1 person ever there to buy something in all my time solo'n.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.  I'll have to think about this.  I've never tried quading in PoF but the Druid is flagged for it.  I wonder how hard it would be to get the Ranger PoF flagged.  Anyone have any tips on that?  I seem to recall something about an 80% rule.<br />
<br />
P.S. I hate Velks.  Slippery. :(<br />
Love the Hole, just didn't head that way in favor of the HotSpot -- CoM.</div></div><hr />

Although it is a fast way to level, you cheat yourself on your other skills, such as offense, defense and other necessary skills.  For lvls 1 thru 10 stick with tutorial, xp is pretty decent and you come out with a pretty decent charm for your level.  Then at 10ish thru 25ish go to PC. after that start grouping in the hot zones.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
At low levels using the DS method, shroud down the PL'ee to a level below but within 5 levels of the mobs. This way you maximize the exp per kill.<br />
 <br />
When you switch to the PBAE method (group with the PL'ee), the lowest shroud level is 50 to group with a level 70 while level 45+ mobs maybe too dangerous for PBAE. A safer way is to use a dire charmed pet and kill level 50+ mobs (the PL'ee can shroud to a level 50 wizard to add to the DPS).</div></div><hr />

I've heard that said before.  That and the you don't learn to play your class comment are both often used.  Don't hear them as much as in the past.  When I first started in 1999 I played my Druid to L35 in about a year.  I think back now and cringe.  Never again.  Never again.<br />
<br />
I don't feel cheated.  I have the tutorial charm.  The skills I'm working on are all at least 135 and most are much higher.  There are ways to PL and raise skills if you put some thought into the process.  I have.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
In any case, shroud down to a lower level will get better exp per kill. Especially when you are within 5 levels with the mob. You get bonus for killing a mob within 5 levels of your own.</div></div><hr />

Interesting.  So I take the Ranger [now 51] and shroud him to L50 as to a Wizard?  Then as I PLing him, he can help AE and still level up at the same time?  If I'm reading you right, this sure seems like an odd thing for Sony to allow.</div></div><hr />

I cant say wether AE'n while grouped is faster then doing DS pl'n or not,  but my SK was only 11 hours old when she hit 55 in velks,  and mobs would stay DB to her until 60's on the ramps.  Yeah its slippery in a few places,  but once you learn those the rest is cake.  You do have to constantly watch the push the mobs have though.<br />

Melee combat skills go up extremely fast just grouping at higher lvl's so you should be fine as long as your not MT.  And being a ranger you can just autofire while kiting in fire.</div></div><hr />

Good advice on flagging.  I'll definitely keep my eyes pealed for open signup back flagging raids.<br />
<br />
With what I read on the expansion I think I want to wait and see how easy they make getting AA's at level 51.  Undecided there.<br />
<br />
A buddy of mine wants a CoH Mage so I'm going to box his Mage and another toon for mea Shadow Knight or a Beastlord.  Should be fun.  Maybe I'll pay better attention to his played this time.  LoL, nah!</div></div><hr />

Not sure if shroud form wiz can do PBAE. Most likely not. However you get a little better exp per kill at 50 than 51, especially when killing a level 45 mob (which is within 5 levels of 50). Therefore even if your shrouded wiz does not help at all, you still gain benefit. The drawback is that you cannot track exp when in shroud form. You can get AAs that way as well (shrouded to a lower level does not prevent you from getting AA exp).</div></div><hr />

Pulled a mob with the low level Druid stuns and with ensnare.  I was able to generate enough aggro to hold a mob on the Druid for an hour while the Ranger plinked away.  Spent at least 4 hours doing this with a fairly low delay bow.  Emptied all of my bags which were full of arrows.  I got 100 skill ups.  Last mob took 45 minutes to down.  Skill now at 170.  Will take at least another night like this to get it to 245.  <br />

Should have brought INT gear I guess.  The whole time I'm thinking&#8230;..skillups that take this long don't make the game fun.  Black hole time sink.  Thankfully most of my melee skills are already in the 140 to 160 ranger.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I asked him again after reading your posts.  I was mistaken.   He did it for leadership points, not AA's.  <br />

Leadership abilities actually are useful, HoTT is wonderful, mana and health regen are good as well. Some of the benefits are great for raiding, delegating who is Main Assist, and marking NPC's so everyone knows which mob to kill first - and the mezzers can mez the others.<br />
 <br />
While I wouldnt say its &quot;neccesary&quot; it is definately beneficial.. albeit very slow progression - heh.</div></div><hr />
