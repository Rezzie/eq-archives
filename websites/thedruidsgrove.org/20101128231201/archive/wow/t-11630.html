I mean what would you consider to be average or decent stats?<br />
<br />
 Lately I havent really had enough time to run instances or pvp so all of my gear is from questing or from the AH. Currently I am sitting at 7k hp, 1910 AP, and 31% crit. To me it seems decent for just blue gear but I do know that people are running around with 2000+ ap and 32%+ crit.<br />
<br />
 Also I dont have any enchants except for +13crit to shoulders and Cobra Hide kit on legs, so enchant recommendations are appreciated. I also can cook my own stat food and make my own potions.<br />
<br />
 thanks</div></div><hr />

The third boss in Botanica drops Dreamer's Dragonstaff (http://www.thottbot.com/i28325), which is the best cat weapon in the game you get outside of raidcontent and heroic instances.<br />
<br />
I would wait with enchants until you have the really good pieces, because you will need your money for epic flight form (or epic mount).<br />
<br />
A good place to find better equip for kitty damage is http://www.gurgleblaster.net/emmerald/Cat_Sustained_DPS/Head.html (formerly maintained here http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=104460524&amp;sid=1, also found here http://druid.wikispaces.com/DPS+Gear+List)<br />
<br />
Your current stats are quite good already (assuming they are your stats when unbuffed). You should be leading the damage meters in five mans all the time (I have 2,2k AP and 30% crit and do). <br />
So just keep playing, do all the quests in Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley (some good rewards there) and try to get into heroic instances, because all the really good stuff that is within easy reach drops there.<br />
<br />
As for enchants: Everything with AP, str or agi is great. Do not forget that with Heart of the Wild you get 2,4 AP per point of str. so 12 str is better than 24 ap for ferals. <br />
<br />
Also: the more AP you have, the better 1% crit gets. So with 1000 AP I would take 100 AP over 1% crit. With 2000 AP I would definitely take 1% crit over 100 AP. Try to keep your +hit rating somewhere around 70-100.<br />
Also never forget your dodge value. A dead kitty does no damage ^^. You should be at least around 30% here as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps you a bit.<br />

best regards</div></div><hr />

<br />
 I have been using wowiki alot lately and as a result have picked up 3 or 4 very nice quest items that I had previously missed and have my eye on 1 0r 2 more. When I get time again, which will be next week (woot vacation), I will make sure and hit up Botanica and try for that staff. I also need to live in Steamvaults for awhile for the rep.<br />
<br />
  Right now im torn on the epic mount/form issue. The epic form will be cool just to have but at the moment I dont see epic mounts being worth 5k. Maybe thats just because i dont have one hehe.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind some are pretty pricey so you want to make sure you'll keep the gear for a while.<br />
<br />
Back: Enchant Cloak - Greater Agility (+12 Agi)<br />
Chest: Enchant Chest - Exceptional Stats (+6 All Stats) ((All the +all stats are better than any other single increase here))<br />
Feet: Enchant Boots - Dexterity (+12 Agi)<br />
Finger: Enchant Ring - Stats (+4 All Stats)<br />
Hands: Enchant Gloves - Major Strength (+15 Str)<br />
Head: Glyph of Ferocity (+34 AP, +16 Hit)((FYI:Need faction rep to purchase))<br />
Legs: Nethercobra Armor (+45 AP, +12 Crit)<br />
One-hand: Enchant Weapon - Potency (+15 Str)<br />
Shoulder: Greater Inscription of Vengeance (+30 AP, +10 Crit)((FYI:Need faction rep to purchase))<br />
Two-hand: Enchant 2H Weapon - Major Agility (+35 Agi)<br />
Wrist: Enchant Bracer - Brawn (+12 Str)<br />
<br />
These are a combination of player provided enchants, armor kits and vendor (faction) enchants. In the combination above give the best overall DPS/Dodge/Crit.</div></div><hr />

What boss is Terestrain Illhoof, and how hard is he to get to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The added AP (2.4 per str), this gives you a 28.8 increase to AP, which is a greater return than 9.6 AP, .2% dodge, .02% crit, 40 hp and minimal armor increase from stats for pure dps...remember my enchants are going for the best dps, not necessarily what you would put on a &quot;well-rounded&quot; druid.</div></div><hr />
