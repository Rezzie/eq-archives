<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bibbe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if the Warmly Glowing Stone portion is MQ-able.  I have the Softly Glowing Stone and a guildie has the Pulsing Greenstone off Venril Sathir's remains.  Is this turn in MQ-able?<br />
Dig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chlorala Bructeri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Considering the method of turn-in (both stones to same person) I don't see why not, as long as the person helping you isn't KoS to Foloal (can't remember exact name).  The ranger stone from Air can be MQed with the hammer from The Hole the exact same way so I don't see why this one couldn't be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The answer is yes, and dubious faction is sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thandril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The VS stone I used was multi-quested with max KOS DE cleric. Brought a enchanter along who charmed the npc, she handed in the stone, I handed in the rest and it worked out just fine for me. Was some time ago though but I havent heard that anything in that area has been changed.</div></div><hr />
