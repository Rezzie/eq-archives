<br />
After that turn-in, will single signets turn-ins continue to yield goodie bags?<br />
<br />
There's a really nice feral mace from the bag and I'm jsut trying to size up the workload to get it.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise I don't see how half my guilds warriors are all carrying that same mace around.  Though personally for druids I prefer my Bonecrusher with +15 STR enchant.</div></div><hr />

I just dinged 55, and have done the first two quests in silithus:  killing the snakes, then killing spiders and scorpions to gather things they drop.  After finishing those two, I got friendly rep with the cenarion circle, which I guess is cool.  I found one other quest, but cant remember.  Where do I get this bonecrusher that you are talking about?  <br />

The best answer to your first two questions is wait till your 60.  Duke's require atleast 5 level 60's if your all geared decently (you can get prob away with 4 if your BWL pimp'n)... <br />
<br />
This is how it works.  You kill the twilight cultist, they drop cloths (robe/shoulders/hood), if you have friendly faction with Cen Ciricle you can equip those cloths and activate a Lesser Windstone that you see around the twilight camps.  That summons up a Templar that's either lightning/Fire/Water/Earth... listed from hardest to easiest.  The thing of it is - you have to be level 60 to equip the cloths to summon templar.  I solo'm regularly at 60... so they're druidable.<br />
<br />
Everytime you kill a templar, they drop 1 crest.  With 3 crests and a Large Brilliant Shard you can get a medallion of station.  You equip the medallion and cultist robe/hood/shoulders and then activate the 'Windstone' and summon a Duke.  As mentioned you want atleast 5 people (prob 7-10 if your actually using this as a guide :shuffle: ).  I actually like to bring in some mid 50's/new 60's guildies to get some of the gear that drops from these guys.<br />
<br />
Duke drop Signets like templar's drop crests... 3 signets and 5 large brilliant shards will get you a Ring that allows you to summon one of the royalty.... when you have revered faction.  These are summoned from the &quot;greater windstones&quot; and can drop epic loots.<br />
<br />
The only reward I'm aware of for faction other then the summoning is enchanter reciepes that require faction to buy...<br />
<br />
*edit* oh yea, Bonecrusher from is a quest from DMwest that starts and ends in the instance itself.   DMwest is the hardest of the DM's and for the best to be 60... DM east is much more friendly to a 55.  I personally prefer the Fist of Ommok (drop in LBRS) to the Bonecrusher for the hp's, but it's a tough call. (29str 12sta vs. 30str 1%crit)... Fist def' looks cooler imho.<br />
<br />
**double edit** I gotta stop working and focus on posting &gt;&lt;<br />
After that turn-in, will single signets turn-ins continue to yield goodie bags?<br />
<br />
It takes 3 signets after the initial turn-in.</div></div><hr />

Some of the quests are level limited - you won't be able to get them until 58 or 60 - don't recall which.<br />

There are leatherworking recipes (general LW, all items are mail /sigh), but the major thing CC rep gets you is the ability to summon more powerful bosses.  At friendly you can summon Templars (most duo-able, easier with 3) and Dukes (can be 4 or 5-manned easily enough) iirc.  At revered, you can summon 40-man raid bosses (most be taken down with 25 or 30 for MC level raiders - but that poison guy is a big pain).</div></div><hr />

3-man'ed one this friday.  Warrior, Mage, Druid.  Everyone's in partial tier 1.  It was a close fight.  I had to use *all* my mana tricks to keep the warrior alive.</div></div><hr />

The problem with bringing 3 people to do dukes is 'what if nature or fire spawn' even frost seems unlikely as a trio'.  Given the fact that it costs 1 LBS and 3 Crests and a set of twillight gear... why risk it?</div></div><hr />

Also, I've been spending some time in Silithus lately to farm scorpid blood for darkmoon neck, so I got all the quests and have been working on them this past week. Two questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is there any way to summon a specific Templar? Or is it totally random, doesn't make a difference which Lesser Windstone you summon from?<br />
<br />
2. Are all four Templars (Lightning/Fire/Water/Earth) solo-able by a competent druid?</div></div><hr />

I havn't had a problem as a 30/21 or my usual 2/14/35.  The best advice is to clear the area for adds and keep an eye out for the Prophet and her crew.<br />
<br />
The only way to summon a specific is to turn in texts to the hermit... I've never actually done this since I'm after CC rep' but from what I understand there's a chance that he'll send you a scroll that let's you choose one of two specific summons.</div></div><hr />

What strategy are you using to solo them?  The more specifics the better.  Are you going bear, cat or root/kite?  What type of equip are you using?  <br />
<br />
I'm 30/21 with just average level 60 gear (high-level instance gear).  I've tried to bear them but since the templar's damage is magical it isnt' reduced by my armor (the main advantage of bear form).  I also tried cat but then I lack the bear stun and frenzied regen.  Both times, I ran out of mana (from switching and healing) before my bear/cat form could do enough damage to kill it.  I haven't tried root/kite yet.</div></div><hr />

It's great for a cat druid.  The quested DM mace or the Fist of Ommok are arguably a bit better for bear.</div></div><hr />
