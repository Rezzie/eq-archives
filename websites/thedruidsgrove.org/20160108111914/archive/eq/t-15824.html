Sorry if starting a new topic upsets anyone, but here is my problem.<br />
Almost 2 years ago in NC I got the Frost Shard off of the Bazu Scavenger. I did not even have 2.0 started and the mob was there.<br />
I have completed 1.5 and now working on 2.0.<br />
I am up to the part where I go take the Rune of Yuisaha to Historian Finrazel in Nedaria. Do I HAVE to have the combine bag for the 4 shards to do the 4 mobs needed? Thank you<br />

<br />
Do you have to have the bag to spawn the fights where you collect the shards? Yes<br />
<br />
Does it need to be on you?  I don't recall off hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other three encounters are all spawned events as well.  You need the invisble flag for when you receive the combine bag in order to spawn them, however you do not need to actually carry the bag around (i.e can be in the bank).</div></div><hr />
