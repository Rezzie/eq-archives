I have a few quetions about how to currently spec.<br />
I just started raiding Kara and am sitting around 1250+healing and 120-130 mp5.<br />
I love healing and love being a ToL but the solo aspec for questing and Farming is driving me crasy.<br />
I've been messing around on talent calculators with spec's that incorporate some feral in them (have a relatively decent feral set): something along the lines of http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxMGoZxEctcq0eot<br />
or<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxMGscZxxcxcq0eot<br />
I had been incorporating some balance into my spec for solo play but find that with my current healing gear my +dmg is quite pathetic.<br />
I Guess my question is will taking points out of resto to put them into feral for farming hinder my healing in raids?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Stick to your healing gear (or PVP healing gear depending on your server type) and damaging spells for soloing.  Your damage right now is ample.  Right now I'm sitting at about 575, which isn't that much more than you, and I can solo level 71 normal mobs fine.<br />
<br />
I think the problem here lies in what spells you're using--what is your spell rotation when soloing mobs?<br />
<br />
As far as spec goes, the way I specced I had 13 points leftover after taking all of the talents I wanted in resto (I didn't take anything that buffed HT/Tranq), so I popped them into balance.  The balance talents are great for soloing (no interrupt while casting Entangling Roots?  Yes plix!), and with the release of ZA you can also explain them away to your class/raid leader as increasing your survivability in PVE.</div></div><hr />

I'm told you can heal Kara and up just fine without ToL.  Personally, I've never tried it, and never want to.  I love my tree, and don't think I can ever give it up ( butt-ugly as it might be :redface: )</div></div><hr />

8/11/42?  You're lucky that your class leader lets you get away with that.  :)</div></div><hr />

I wasn't suggesting that you would.  Take my comment at face value.  You are truly lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I first went resto, I truly thought that I needed ALL my points in Resto to be efficient.  So when I wanted to switch it up, I asked my guildies for advise.  Fortunately, our guild already had another Druid healer with that spec, and there had been no raid-healing issues.  So, for me, it was no biggie.   <br />
<br />
Come to think of it, though, I should actually ask the other Druid if he was met with any resistance when he switched it over.</div></div><hr />

There it is.  It works fine for me healing-wise, but I have to admit - although I should - I just don't use my bear form.....ever.  So, for me, the feral talents are kind of a waste of points.  I had these big PvP plans, and they were dashed when I realized that I just couldn't nail my bear-form attacks on the battleground.  <br />
<br />
This sad truth, quite frankly, makes me possibly the worst PvE'r in a PvP situation of all time.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So, on that note....<br />
<br />
What is a more &quot;traditional&quot; tree build?<br />
<br />
I wish I could tell you.  I searched long and hard to find the perfect Tree blend (solo and heal effortlessly), and, I'm pretty sure I've not found it.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the quick responces.<br />
Solo rotation is SF-MF-Roots-IS-SF-Wrath<br />
+DMG is around 400ish<br />
was using http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xcrzbZZxVsxcq0est as a spec however resently met with a lot of resistance healing heroics with people saying that i shouldn't be relying on hots solely for healing so i respec'd full resto to gain the bonus to HT (cause it's useless as tits on a bull with out the talents) but am not enjoying it as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then those ppl dont know **** about a druid-healer!<br />
U dont need to NEVER EVER go out of tree-form as a healer (accept instant HT with switchback to tree).<br />
Sorry if im agressive, but i hate ppl who give advice but dont know anything about the topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as heroic healing goes, you should HoT heal if your bonus healing allows.  Until then, you may have to tough it out with some HTs here and there.<br />
<br />
As for your spell rotation, it's pretty much in sync with what I do:<br />
<br />
SF -&gt; Root -&gt; MF -&gt; SF -&gt; SF -&gt; SF (putting Roots up again when necessary)<br />
<br />
What exactly is the problem when you solo?  Do you find it too slow?  Are you dying a lot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">03-10-2008, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if u are also collecting damage-caster gear and u dont do alot pvp this (http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xcrziZZxVcLcq0eot) would be a nice built too for you.<br />
I had this built for a while now and i think its pretty nice.<br />
Of course there is the fact, that u need the gear for the extra crit-damage. (around 20% crit is nice)<br />
Also celestial focus would help if mobs arent snareable.<br />
<br />
I didnt take Natural Perfection cause i thing its very weak in PvE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zute</div><div class="date">03-13-2008, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm mostly resto with some points in balance.  That way I don't have to carry around 2 sets of gear.  Honestly, I never had any issues with soloing.  I start using Starfire, then root, then dot and keep dotted (insect swarm and moonfire).  Things die reasonably quickly.  I use some wraths too when I'm in a hurry. <br />
<br />
If I pull two mobs, I just root one, heal myself and kill the one whacking on me.<br />
<br />
Here's my spec, I'd like to adjust it just a tad but otherwise very happy with it.  I'm raiding in SSC and ZA and solo when I have time (which isn't often).<br />
