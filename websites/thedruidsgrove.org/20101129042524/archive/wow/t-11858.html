<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootyscoot</div><div class="date">07-01-2007, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just registered today.  Been reading the materials here for a couple weeks, pretty nice forum (especially when compared to the WoW druid forums. ugh...)<br />
<br />
Anyways, little about myself.<br />
<br />
I started WoW playing a NE Rogue, got to level 30 and subsequently quit because I hated questing.  About a year later I started again, rolled a hunter on Hyjal to play with a tier 2 rogue buddy of mine over there...  quit again because I hated questing and the lack of pvp.<br />
<br />
A few months later rolled a hunter on Maiev with a number of friends, leveled him to 51.  Started the level 50 quests for him, wasted about 4 days trying to get some perfect antlers with an absurdly horrid drop-rate.  Never got it, haven't touched the guy since (sorta, I logged on to sell all his armor and xfer the money)<br />
<br />
Re-rolled a Tauren Druid, hit Outlands and transferred to Bonechewer. Now I'm sitting at 69 waiting on my new GPU as my current one is more or less dead.<br />
<br />
Long story short. LOVE the druid.  I love soloing and I love being able to take out any class 1v1 (except for those darn Locks, how I hate them).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I killed him. Hooray for Pounce, 2 crits in a row, a OoC proc and then an FB crit!<br />
<br />
Welcome to the forums. Hope you have a good time.</div></div><hr />
