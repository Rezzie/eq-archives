<br />
I know nothing about macros.  Are there any &quot;tutors&quot; out there with a quick Macro guide for noobs like myself?<br />
<br />
Or perhaps is there an information site somewhere with diffent macro listings?</div></div><hr />

The of the basics is:<br />
<br />
/cast Nature's Swiftness<br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast [target=player] Healing Touch(Rank 11)<br />

<br />
I've see folks /stopcasting in front of all of their healing spells. <br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast lifebloom<br />
<br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast healing touch<br />
<br />
I think this would allow me to start casting HT (2nd macro).  If I needed to I could click the first macro instead (say the target didn't need a full heal after all), it would cancel the HT macro (and save the mana) and instead cast lifebloom, sound right?<br />
<br />
I thought I read the &quot;/stopcasting&quot; is no longer needed (as of 2.3) as there is an implied client side /stopcasting assumed before every spell?  Or something like that?!?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not many actions do not trigger the GCD as being able to chain together too many actions could make botting far too easy.<br />
<br />
The insta-healing touch macro above, will only require 1 button press.<br />
<br />
Many people have macro'd many of their spells to have /stopcasting in front as an interrupt to stop the cast and restart it.  This is beneficial for spell casters ( mainly ), and DPSers could see an increase in DPS using it and understanding how it works with their latency.  <br />
<br />
I use/used /stopcasting to stop by &quot;big heal&quot; and start casting another if the target didn't need the heal.  Yay for proactive healing ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make a macro, type /macro and press enter.<br />
This brings up the macro window.  Create a macro by clicking new, choose a name for the macro (will appear on the button), and choose an icon.  Choosing the &quot;?&quot; icon will use the icon for whatever spell or ability comes first in the macro.<br />
<br />
When you're done choosing a name and icon, click to create the macro.  It appears empty - you need to type some of the macro language in the box at the bottom.  See above for some suggestions.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
Once you've written the macro, drag the button for it onto one of your bars.  Clicking the button on your bar will run the macro.<br />

<br />
/cast nature's swiftness<br />
/cast healing touch (rank 13)<br />
<br />
yes, you don't need the stopcasting part anymore, and i prefer to use the big one instead of rank 11. its needed a lot when a tank takes huge spike dmg and the other healers arent on the ball.<br />
<br />
But back to the quirk, this is IMPORTANT, it is only a one click macro if you are standing still, you need to press it twice if you are moving. I kid you not, that is the truth. Been confirmed many times. i don;t know why this is, it just is, it shouldnt be, but it is.<br />
<br />
Other macros druids use incorperate 'target=mouseover' &amp; 'target=player'so that they dont have to de-select the tank to heal other people so they always know the hp of the tank. (I dont use focus for the tank, i use it on the boss so i know boss's hp and i can see the bosses target).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also don't need the Rank part either. If there is no rank specified, it'll cast the highest possible rank.</div></div><hr />
