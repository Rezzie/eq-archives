<br />
I am thinking (not sure yet) about going to engineering.  I know it is common knowledge that engineering and mining kind of go together, but I love skinning.  It is making me so much more money.  I don't know what it is but ore and bars just are not selling well at all.<br />
<br />
Is it viable to become a skinner/engineer.  I already have a stockpile of low level mining (copper, bronze, and lots of stone).<br />
<br />
I notice that many of the higher level engineer recipes have a mining material, a couple random drop materials, and sometimes leather, so there is no way to completely gather your materials from any one gathering skill.<br />
<br />
Thoughts or comments?</div></div><hr />

It does use some, though.  If skinning is really that much more profitable keep it and buy the bars you need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spent about 10g in supplies + what I had on hand and got my engineering up to 222.<br />
<br />
I guess skinning is doing well because there are only a couple selling higher leather at the AH.  Thick leather and above is a 2-3 skinner market most of the time probably because many people drop skinning around 40.</div></div><hr />

The same thing happens for most tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />

Well that's fine then.  That means those 2 or 3 will always buy my leather.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My logic is that getting 2g worth of leather is easier than it was trying to get 2g worth of ore &lt;-- this being in the uninflated market.</div></div><hr />
