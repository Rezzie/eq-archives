I know there is a bug with ice based spells. But, I have gotten rooted with nets from mobs, I was fighting a warlock on one ocation I almost had him finished off, and he rooted me somehow, not stunned I could cast spells and rotate. Are those bugs too... or is there somthing I'm missing?</div></div><hr />

Being in a form, does however, protect you from being polymorphed or having your mana drained.</div></div><hr />

Did they change that this last patch?  Im going to test this out tonight.  Whenever I see a mage casting poly, I'll switch to cheetah and it negates it.</div></div><hr />

Ah crap. Must be a bug then. :(</div></div><hr />

Frost based snare effects are currently not being removed when shapeshifting.  Blizz has comfirmed it's a bug and will be fixed next content patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrax</div><div class="date">06-02-2005, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that they are doing what they always do and waiting till they can have a HUGE game-altering patch.  Which will probably be at least 60 megs and cause the game to be unplayable for at least a day, maybe two.  It has been how long since we had a patch that did anything, 4-6 weeks?  Tailoring has been bugged since then and there has been absolutely no move to fix it.  For me it is less of an issue as I have close to max tailoring, but for those who are just starting out it sucks.  Imagine trying to raise a skill when you have no idea if something is red, yellow, green, or grey.<br />
<br />
All together, I feel huge patches are a mistake.  There are more chances for something to be wrong and break the game.  They take longer to download, which can be a huge issue for those who are on dial-up.  Usually they cause the servers to be unplayable for at least one, if not more, days.  I say have content patches and bug fix patches and have them as frequently as possible.  Since we are going down for 4-6 hours every Tuesday anyways, use that time to do a bug fix or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
again, they changed it so you can be poly'd in anyform but you can now shift out of it. read the old patch notes :P I've been poly'd in both cat and bear, and you can shift out of them even though the buttons for shift don't show available. The tooltip wasn't updated though the change is still there.</div></div><hr />

SO here goes yet another patch, Cold-based spells still do not remove with free action potions or shapeshifting. This is quite unbalancing and needs to be on a higher priority with the Developers. Wanna make things fair? put a slowing component on our moonfire (Yeah Right) &gt;=(</div></div><hr />

this bug drives me absolutely insane, I wish they'd fix it soon &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

I tried a mage guildie poly me several times in a duel today and it just said immune or something..? Can't it be a lag issue, where you shift to bear or cat but one nanosecond earlier the mage poly´d you, but the animation went wacko?<br />
<br />
Why a mage would poly a druid is still a mystery to me. :)</div></div><hr />

Ya true. I have my travel form on the middle mouse button for just that reason.</div></div><hr />
