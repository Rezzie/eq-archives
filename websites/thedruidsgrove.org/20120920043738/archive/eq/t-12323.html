I saw this posted somewhere about Gift of Mana not working with healing spells as it is supposed to.  I have not seen it go off, but perhaps I am not casting SI or chloro enough since I still use NI quite a bit to conserve mana.<br />
<br />
Also is Abundant Healing worth it at 30 sec/250/tick proc that does not proc very often for 25  AA?  I still have other AA I need to work on, but I like to max my healing capacity when it is very helpful<br />

I decided that it isn't important and I'll be getting everything before it minus bandage and see invis</div></div><hr />

I think this AA sucks since I have yet to see it work as it's intended, and I have it trained to level 5. They definitely need to up the % chance for the HoT effect. Gift of Mana I haven't had any problems with, sometimes that goes off 3 times in a row for me if I get lucky :).</div></div><hr />

However, you may be right... maybe it didn't go live at all or maybe it isn't fixed yet, but lots of stuff didn't make the patch message and maybe this is one of them.<br />
<br />
All we know is they are working on it, and i'm sure its not something that they will put off like stances.</div></div><hr />

Just did 3 full mana bars of ancient and not 1 Gift of Mana proc.  On the other hand I seem to get Abundant Healing proc around every 1 in 5-6 casts so not sure where Neliana is coming from.  I think depending on which you trained first the opposite doesn't work.  As in my GoM3 has never ever procced on a heal, I used to think GoM just really sucked because I never seen it go off, until reading about this bug.</div></div><hr />

I did train my GoM to max before starting Abundant Healing, and yet waste bars of mana in the guildpool just trying to get the damn thing to proc on me. No luck with the HoT.</div></div><hr />

It pops up in the receiver's song box.  Try chain casting heals on yourself and see if you get it to pop ;)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I saw an AH for the first time the other night when I cast a heal on me, course it was after the raid mob had died and was just healing up my group for next thing. (on AH2 so far)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">10-22-2005, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was talking specifically about AH5 and GoM3.<br />
<br />
BTW yesterday i saw 1 or 2 more AH5 procs... GoM is still kinda rare off heals.</div></div><hr />

Wishful thinking but they ought to refund the ability if they aren't going to/aren't able to fix it. =/  It's been a known issue for quite a while and it would be really nice to see it resolved faster than exodus was =/</div></div><hr />
