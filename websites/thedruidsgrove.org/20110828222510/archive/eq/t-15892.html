 <br />
Are the gating/healing mobs too much of a pain to bother with?<br />
 <br />
I don't have any of the vengeance spells yet, which makes me cry, them are some nice dps dots.</div></div><hr />

At 54 why not try Plane of Nightmare werewolves? It's outdoors, should be good xp and at least they used to drop valuable gems fairly often. The wolves run 51-ish so you could root-rot, or maybe even quad or charm-kite, depending on what spells a druid has in the &quot;arsenal&quot; at 54. <br />
<br />
With the adds and runners in Seb, I wouldn't think soloing would make sense at all.</div></div><hr />

Back then I could keep it clear and maybe a couple more spawns.  Nowadays, with ooc regen and the upgraded FT available I would think you could really do some damage.  Keep in mind the named do summon so you will want to be ready to porcupine and nuke them down fast.<br />

edit:bonus to this...I got rich on gem drops.</div></div><hr />
