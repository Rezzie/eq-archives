Only thing I know for sure is that hornets in BW are slow enough to make them nice staff fodder.<br />

Any other info would be nice.<br />

Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

BTW 10 sec cast time<br />
<br />
WARNING if lag hits mobs sometimes warp ahead a step so dont put your life on the line that your spell will hit befor they reach you.<br />
<br />
WARNING mobs with big reach IE dragons/giants will reach you before your spell is finished <br />
<br />
INFO IN FAST MOBS i hunt the raptors in TD which are VERY VERY fast mobs considering they are not named or anything.  id have to estimate they are 85-90% of jboots speed.  when i snare them and then use lumi staff later it stil lhits them before they reach me.  and i dont know too many normal mobs who are faster than these guys, so u shud be fine without worrying about MOBs speed.</div></div><hr />

Even snared they would always get me before the cast was finished when snared.  Unfortunately, I did not try on any other mobs and got rid of it thinking that it was useless to a druid.  :(  I have read more on this board that makes me think I was dead wrong.<br />

If your lucky you get a full root and 5 strikes. 1000+ damage for 80 mana is a bit special. Even on a first time breaker you get 100+ for root and 180+ for strike, still a great ratio.<br />

Still learning right now, but up to now it looks good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not smart to use lumi in hilly areas because of the range/Z Axis bug.<br />
<br />
Drood is right about using 5root.  You can get about 4 blasts in. With 49 root you can sometimes get about 8.  Comparable mobs of course(spirocs).</div></div><hr />

Still found it faster (more raptors per hour) to use mana nukes and med and throw out that staff.</div></div><hr />

I will share the &quot;Secrets of the Spiroc/Lumi Masters&quot; with you.<br />
<br />
Normally when you quad, you tried to target the one in the middle, right??  So you got all 4 hits.<br />
<br />
Don't for Spirocs, target the one closest to you(ie the one that just hit ya).  Don't worry about missing the straggler just yet, it will soon bunch up.<br />
<br />
You will get hit, but you have cloro up, right?  Just say you are still working on Defense;)<br />
<br />
Alternately getting hit a couple of times, actually bunches up the stragglers.  <br />
<br />
Only 3 can hit you at a time, the others will just start to walk away.  They don't hit that hard really.<br />
<br />
Face them when you cast, Provens BS for 300ish.  Use your keyboard to turn, not mouselook, it will save you interrupts in addition.  BTW, I use first person view, the other school on this says to use 3rd person.<br />
<br />
If ensnare wears off, the spirocs will usually(if you are out of casting range) just morph back to spawn spot.  Finish off the ones still chasing ya, lev, camo, and go get the one that gated on you asap, it will heal itself.<br />

But a guy who was quadding there, i let him use my lumi for a while, and he let me use his moonstone ring, Oh my god, i could almost get it off 2 times before they reached me LOL it was great. and the best part is he says with his necro he'll get me one WOOT! <br />
