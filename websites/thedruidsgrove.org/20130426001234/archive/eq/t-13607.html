<br />
IMO ours definately has a use, but some of the others are pretty sensational.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">03-26-2006, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel less than enthusiastic about ours than I was back around the release of PoR.<br />
 <br />
They took 1 aspect of each class and matched an aura to that.<br />
 <br />
Monks are known for avoidance.<br />
Warriors need ac.<br />
Chanters = mana regen.<br />
Bards = over haste and nuke boost song effects.<br />
 <br />
Druids = regen.  Apparently that was the only thing left that was somewhat slightly what we do, I guess.  I do not think druids got the best, but I don't think we got the worst end of the deal either.</div></div><hr />

All in all I think we came out of it alright.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaene</div><div class="date">03-27-2006, 02:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What dissapoints me is that each of the other class auras is applicable in general play.  Mana regen, ac, additional defence.... always useful.<br />
<br />
Druids regen is always useful, but insignificant by comparison - the real benefit of the aura is of course the cure.<br />
<br />
I do wonder why it's only disease - I genuinely don't think it would be overpowering if it also cured poison and curse counters. Even if that were the case, it would still be situational - you don't need cure's in general play.<br />
<br />
Not that I'm complaining, just trying to look at the big picture :)</div></div><hr />

Druids in beta perfered Disease over Curse, even tho we pushed for Disease/Poison.</div></div><hr />
