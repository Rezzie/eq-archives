I turned to my wife and said &quot;they're talking about WoW&quot;...<br />
<br />
so i turned to this table and asked &quot;what server are you on?&quot; and we got into a quick discussion about classes and endgame, and then at another table next to ours, another guy who was hanging out with his wife goes &quot;yea, i have a shammy, and im thinking about rolling another toon... what should i roll?&quot;<br />
<br />
the dude who plays a lock suggested locks, the dude who plays a warrior suggested warriors, and i (of course) suggested a dr00d and gave him this site information... lol<br />
<br />
ever come across random conversations about WoW and get into the discussion?</div></div><hr />

At today's company meeting while new employees were being introduce, one of their bio's included &quot;Recovering WoW player.  5 months&quot;.<br />
<br />
While I tracked him down after the meeting I ran into 2 others that play.<br />
<br />
One of them was talking about his toons and mentioned &quot;....my RL friends....&quot;.  At which point I mentioned that you don't need to use acronyms while actually speaking.</div></div><hr />

LOL, I say that to people on vent all the time. One of the only acronyms I find appropriate for saying is DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was about 12 midnight and there was already a queue forming when we arrived.  We found out there were only 17 copies available, which meant only 5 people after us would be able to get a copy.<br />
We waited and lots of people pitched up behind us, and everyone in the queue was talking about Warcraft.<br />
<br />
I live in Aberdeen in Scotland and I can tell you it is really bizarre to hear someone speaking about the game in a local accent.  There was a woman of about 50 who was talking about pvp'ing with her hunter.  She said (trying to simulate the accent here, bare with me) &quot;I just canny get wi rogues, i just, as soon as they hit me, i just.. .thats me, am just done&quot;<br />
<br />
The guy directly behind me was telling me about his paladin, and how he could sit there all day just healing away.<br />
<br />
It was truly surreal being a supermarket surrounded by WoW players.  What really struck me more than anything was the fact that the game had brought us all together, and there was an instant and tangible connection between us and an impromptu community formed just like that.<br />
<br />
We even gave one of the guys a lift home, and in the car he was telling us about how his guild had killed Kel'Thuzud right before the expo hit.  Awesomez =)<br />

I'm a grad student at University of Florida and I've frequently heard a group of IT guys in my collge talking about gear and such.. Though IT guys playing is kinda expected...  I do look at people around me, and wonder if they do play.. what would their characters be? (Warriors might have Napoleonic complexes, are some Druids hippies or Wiccans?, Is that overwieght 40 something year old playing a Female bloodelf?)  <br />
<br />
However, some of my most dumb &quot;I'm not in the game and should not do these things in real life&quot; moments are:<br />
<br />
Answered the phone - &quot;No, sorry, Jamie is AFK right now, can I take a message?&quot; <br />
           (Similarly on the phone, holding the  shift key while talking...)<br />
<br />
Hit 'r' when responding to a gmail IM. <br />
And most recently.... I had some files on my desk, went to get a drink and files were gone, turned over to my coworker &quot;Did you ninja my files?&quot;.... <br />
 <br />
I may need a break from the game, lol.<br />

I have to make a real effort not to do it, especially if I've been recently using Vent (or TS).</div></div><hr />
