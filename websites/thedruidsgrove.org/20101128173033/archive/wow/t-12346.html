It's difficult to explain what it does... but in brief, it shows flashy colorful things on your UI when you or your target gain or lose a buff or debuff.  It's really helpful to let you know in a split second when important things have happened (like an OoC proc, or Prince Malchezzar's Enfeeble ability).<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend it.<br />

Imageshack works perfectly, however they have a few different sites and only one of them is good for hosting images without any hassle.<br />

I took the liberty of hosting your picture for you.  I managed to trick angelfire into releasing the picture eventually..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">01-29-2008, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a curious kitty*, I checked out SpartanUI.com and downloaded the files. When WoW comes back online I'll play around with it and see what's up with it.<br />
<br />
I have a question for Apple or anyone else who uses it already - I see that many of the mods it contains are outdated, and on the main page the author himself says that it's not 2.2 compatible.  But many of the mods are Ace mods and I know there are updated versions of them available on files.wowace.com.<br />
<br />
Have you run the Ace updater to keep many of the bundled mods up to date?  or just change the number in the .toc file so that WoW thinks it's up to date.  Obviously if you are still using Spartan, there must be some way to make it &gt;2.2 compatible.<br />
<br />
*or bored bear - it's maintenance day, after all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AppleJax</div><div class="date">01-30-2008, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spartan is a bit unforgiving when it comes to learning how to manipulate it and move bars around. Especially for widescreen; it's default is for normal fullscreen.<br />
<br />
I have to go to bed soon, otherwise I'd give a more exhausting breakdown. Basically you want to play with Bartender to move around the, ah, bars. That's basically all I did, really. Mess around with the options, &quot;see what happens.&quot; If I really messed something up I just removed Spartan and reinstalled. And when I hit a big block I just went to the Spartan site and asked for help!<br />
<br />
Spartan looks shmecksy as hell but it's also a metric ****ton harder to manipulate than the default Blizzard UI. Part of the reason is just the nature of a more maleable UI: to have more options you need... more options in the menu! ^_^ But it's also because, frankly, it's not put together ideally. Sorry, this is one of those &quot;MANY HOURS TO EARN THESE POWERS&quot; occassions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already had half the mods that are in spartan installed, and I'll adapt a few of the others and include them in my mix.  I'd really like to have the custom artwork background from spartan working, but since it relies on Discord Art and that series of mods is pretty much defunct, I have to go backgroundless.<br />
<br />
Which, now that I look closer, I see your adaptation of spartan doesn't have the graphic background strip at the bottom either.<br />

The cluster of buttons on the left of the minimap correspond with the buttons on my Nostromo N52, and the buttons on the right of the map correspond to it's thumbpad and main thumb button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, what bar/button mod does Spartan use?  Unit Frames?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">01-31-2008, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bartender3 is the bar mod in SpartanUI.  <br />
<br />
I have used Bongos2 in the past with nearly the same setup, but since Bartender3 is Ace and more easily updated, I went with that.<br />
<br />
And yes, the page changes with form shifts to show appropriate abilities.<br />
<br />
Word of Warning: if you use Bartender3, make sure you do not have TheoryCraft2 installed - they do not play well together and TC2 will keep your paging from working correctly.  I just wasted my whole lunch hour trying to figure out why when I was in cat form and tried to prowl, I instead shifted to caster and shadowmelded.  Reason? When TC2 and Bartender3 are installed together, a button press somehow triggers the button at that position on your first bar, regardless of which stance/form bar is showing at that time.  And on my setup, Prowl and Shadowmeld are both at the lower right position, but on different stance bars.<br />
<br />
DrDamage works just fine with both Bongos2 and Bartender3 though (also it's an Ace mod).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">02-01-2008, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure.  My thumb buttons on the right of the minimap are constant, as are the 'normal' button bars along the left side of the screen, only the ones in the array on the left of the minimap change with stance/form.<br />
<br />
I'm at work, so I can't tell you exactly the name of the setting, but I remember that one of the options you can set for each bar on an individual basis is paging yes/no.</div></div><hr />

I miss playing Warcraft with my friends. I may level up something else, and keep the Rogue around to see how 2.4 plays out. Who knows? :)<br />

Whilst im playing normally, swstats, grid, omen, focus target, xraidstatus, dbm and raid bars are all gone, leaving me with a huge viewing area. <br />
<br />
And as i mentioned before, i don't usually have everything going at once (for one, grid isnt needed for this fight) and i can minimise xraidstatus during fights as well. It just so heppens we were like 10 seconds into the fight and i wanted to see how many different buffs i could get up when the boss was pulled, and if you take away the warnings message on the screen, its very easy for me to see the surround area on my screen.<br />
<br />
And i can move swstats to the bottom right corner (behind the tooltip which only appears on mouse over of something) and it does suddenly become a lot clearer.<br />
<br />
That's how i like to play, everything there has it's use, and is used frequently, i just hadn't put away the things i didnt need yet. If i had a screenie of the fight 20 seconds onwards you would see the improvement :) It does look cluttered, but i do have a big screen so it doesnt seem that way for me.</div></div><hr />

This is what strikes me about a UI that totally occludes your screen: you can't see ****. You're Stevie ****ing Wonder. Blindness is something people cure, not willingly inflict upon themselves. Some healers argue &quot;all I need to see are the bars.&quot; This is not true. There are plenty of fights where you have to move around alot. Hell, even in Old World pre-60 instances, you should be watching the mobs and your party members' positions. I would go so far as to say that the number of fights where you can just stand in one place and stare at bars are the vast minority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unit Frames - I just love the look of the ones you have<br />
Buff Icons with the time remaining under them<br />
<br />
I think I recognize everything else like Grid, FuBar etc, but those unit frames for your party and you and the buffs with Timers I like the look of much better than what I'm using.</div></div><hr />
