<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">11-03-2007, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The build you've listed is different than the one you linked.<br />
<br />
For PvP, the build you have linked is good with one exception; drop Omens and go for Force of Nature. As Trixtaa said, they are worth it in PvP. They dish out a good amount of DPS and only a 3 min cooldown. Plus, chances are you'll never melee, especially in PvP, going Bookmin, so Omen is actually worthless. It's only worth a &quot;if you have points&quot; spec.<br />
<br />
Nature's Swiftness is good for them instant roots and cyclones. Although I don't think it's worth loosing Force of Nature over it.</div></div><hr />

So safe to say this for now:<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?5003220125331352310010000000000000000  0000050550301000000000000<br />
<br />
And this once I get mostly +damage gear:<br />

Thanks for the info for the dark side ^.^ I didn't think that the treants was that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't you use +damage cloth gear?  Sure your squishier, but in the interim, cloth is way better if you can amp your damage by a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canidbeast</div><div class="date">11-05-2007, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Long story short because I'd rather have the armor.  It helps to keep me alive in pvp.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
And I really don't have much in the way of cloth.  After the saved honor, the one piece that I can think of is gonna be replaced.</div></div><hr />
