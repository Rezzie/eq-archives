I was curious.  What's the current thoughts on DPS and tanking enchants.  As I picked up the Staff of Trickery  (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37883)from Heroic Violet Hold I wanted to get a decent enchant for it.  Now I need to farm up the staff out of heroic Utgarde Pinnacle for tanking too.<br />
<br />
Ok sorry I should have explained... I took the Sharp Barbed Leather Belt  (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37194)and slotted not one but two Solid Dragon's Eyes  (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=36767)in it.</div></div><hr />

why is that so bad? best tanking belt currently available.<br />
Even in Naxx(10er) nothing better drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
staff-enchant i would go vor 85 AP on DPS<br />
and mongoose on tanking-staff.</div></div><hr />

I mean it was obscenely good (IMO).  Half the guild just did a Daaaammmmnnnn when they saw what I did with it.<br />
<br />
I kind of figured that Mongoose might still be superior for a tanking staff, but wasn't sure.  Guess we are still waiting to see what the new high end enchants will be to replace Mongoose.</div></div><hr />

I must look out for some of them. i've not looked at new wrath gems tbh as so far i've not gained any new wrath gear with gem slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goose</div><div class="date">12-12-2008, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like +35 agility better than mongoose for tanking, seems more consistant imo, but also much cheaper. When i get my cash flow higher i'm gonna try out the new &quot;healthguard&quot; i think its called, its the enchant that chance on hit healz for 140. Don't forget this also adds to AOE threat as well. I just don't know what the proc rate will be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-12-2008, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, healthgaurd sounds good, but it will depend on the proc rate.  140 heal is pretty small when you consider bosses in raid hit for 3k-30k.  Because the amount of the heal is so low, I am assuming the proc rate would be rather high.  <br />
<br />
As for consitency on mongoose, vs +35, I would favor mongoose because its seems to proc almost everytime its off CD for me.  I would say in raid mongoose is up more than it is down while in combat.</div></div><hr />

The procrate seems really fine. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rorgg</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mongoose is currently still your best tanking enchant.  With the proc rate as it stands, it works out to around 43 agi or something, so it's slightly ahead of 35 AGI.  Then again, the flat stat is always on... I wouldn't quibble with either.<br />
<br />
I read that there's a new 2H tanking enchant coming, something along the lines of 75 STA.  I'm far, far on the side of mitigation/avoidance over &quot;sack-of-HP&quot; but that might get me to consider it.  Ideally, we'll also get some sort of Northrend mit/av enchant soon as well.</div></div><hr />
