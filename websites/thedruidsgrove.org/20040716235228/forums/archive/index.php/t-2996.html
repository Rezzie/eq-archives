<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freekin65</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm not soloing, I regularly group wiht a 58 Enchanter, 58 Rogue, 57 Shadow Knight, 57 Cleric, and 55 Shaman.  We are now in UP and plan to stay awhile to outfit the group with new armor.  I'm having problems with my group spell lineup and would like some help.  <br />
<br />
Here is what I have now:<br />
<br />
1. Ensnare<br />
2. Sup. Heal/Cloro/Swap<br />
3. Engulfing Root<br />
4. Shield of Thorns<br />
5. Fixation of Ro<br />
6. Breath of Ro<br />
7. Starfire<br />
8. Another nuke/dot/misc<br />
<br />
To free up one slot, I have a Crucible of Escape hotkeyed.  I have our enchanter targetted with a hotkey, so I can keep her healed while she is mezzing.<br />
<br />
I don't know what I should have in my 8th slot.  Should I load Ro's Fiery Sundering and drop all 3 Ro's on a mob?  Or should I load Fury of Air and stun?  Or is there a better spell that I'm missing (such as another nuke/dot)?<br />
<br />
Lastly, what root should I use?  I like Engulfing Root for soloing, but it may not be the best one for grouping.  I use my root for backup root parking only.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AzariahTunare</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Would suggest nixing Fixation and putting in Ro's Fiery Sundering instead.  Resist level is much lower and is going to be more mana efficient to allow your starfire's to go in for full value.  <br />
<br />
I'd put winged death in your other slot.  Elysian's take long enough to die this should be mana efficient.<br />
<br />
I'd unmem Sup. Healing and keep Chloro as your primary heal.  With a cleric in the group your main healing responsibility is only to keep chanter/cleric alive in bad situation, which a faster heal is more equipped for.  <br />
<br />
Edited for root - I always keep the highest root memmed if you don't have a clicky item, but thats just me.  <br />

<br />
How do you make a hot key for something in your inventory?  I have never heard of it before!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freekin65</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Open up your inventory and put your crucible in an open inventory slot (not inside a bag). Left-click and hold your left mouse key down until the invientory slot jumps onto the cursor.  You'll know what I mean when you do this.  <br />
<br />
Now move your cursor (with inventory slot attached) over to one of the 10 positions in your hotkey bank and left click.  The inventory slot should drop into that place.<br />
<br />
To use the cruible, either left click on it or press the key on your keyboard assigned to that hotkey position.<br />
<br />
Hope you can understand my instructions.<br />

<br />
Glad I was able to help out a fellow druid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rheims</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want my advice.....Winged Death is a must-mem, it contributes a lot to the dps of your group.  I suggest de-mem all your other offensive nukes and dots and mem winged death instead. The rest can be buffs, heals, utility spells.<br />
<br />
Like:<br />
Sup heal<br />
Chloroblast<br />
Winged Death<br />
Ensnare<br />
Root<br />
Thorns/Strength buff  swapping. The strength buff stacks with shaman focus series. <br />
Fury of Air, to stun gaters, this is an important spell for druids in dungeons. While enc's and clerics often do the stunning, sometimes they are busy or late.<br />
Group chloro/regrowth<br />
<br />
Use your highest level root for root parking, they last longer as they get higher.<br />
<br />
One last tip: when you see the enchanter get hit, start healing right away, before their health bar drops, there's usually a few seconds as the mob is cutting through the enchanter's rune and by the time your heal hits they will need it. Sometimes it's a waste but often it's a life/group saver.<br />

<br />
Go get yourself an Elder Spiritist's Gaunts for a few plat in the Bazaar and un-mem ensnare in these group situations. You can snare with the gaunts in a group situation after you have your first wave of dots landed...<br />
<br />
Use Winged and Drifting as a combo instead of Breath if you are interested in mana efficiency, at least for me Breath fizzles and gets resisted way too much.<br />
<br />
Do what you can to get the Coldain Military Bracer (will need someone on Giant faction to help you). It has Extended Affliction 3 which will add 20%(?) to the length of your dots....<br />
<br />
Always keep a stun up...haven't hunted in UP much so don't know about gaters there, but it really sucks to have something almost dead only to have it gate away and bring back friends....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm...Did they change the level of Chloroblast?  I don't think a 53 druid really has any other viable healing options for the group being discussed in this thread other than Sup. Heal.<br />
