<br />
What non-instant nature spell might a kitty be casting these days?<br />
<br />
I know I was never much of a kitty DPSer, but the only spell I ever cast was &quot;Rebirth&quot; which I don't think is considered &quot;Nature&quot;.</div></div><hr />

but probably cyclone, roots and heals is what they are aiming for</div></div><hr />

Well originally I was assuming stuff in the Resto tree was not considered &quot;Nature&quot;, but now I think that assumption was wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i LOVE it! it works pretty well in BG's so far... I'm looking forward to more survivability in arena, too.<br />
<br />
/happydance<br />
<br />
edit: i actually got to use it for regrowth a couple times in Vault10 and Ony10 last night.<br />
yea, i shouldn't have been standing in the fire, i know i know... but it makes all the difference in the world when healers say that they won't heal you if you're standing in the fire.<br />
<br />
Oh, and yea... Starfire is arcane... that would be sweet though</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thottbot is idiotic and i won't go there anymore. They're classifying all Nature school spells as &quot;Restoration&quot;<br />
<br />
if it's resto, it's in the Nature school.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't played around with this, but does it work on both balance and resto spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">09-23-2009, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrath, Entangling Roots, Hibernate, and Cyclone are all in the Nature school, and these are affected by the new talent.<br />
<br />
Most Balance damage spells are in the Arcane school like Moonfire and Starfire.</div></div><hr />
