<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">04-29-2007, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nodyin (http://www.graffe.com/forums/member.php?u=9609) Sony's AA Dev has been speaking to Wizards about their AA lines which increase the critical chance for a limited time at the expense of increased mana cost.  The entire thread is located here. (http://www.graffe.com/forums/showthread.php?t=48190)<br />
<br />
He did however, have this to say during one of his posts:<br />
<br />
Percentage based systems are very very very bad from a design standpoint and ultimately for the player as well. The worst thing that can happen to me as an AA designer is to realize that a given upgrade has reached the 100% effectiveness point which means no more upgrades. There are a number of AA lines that are dead ends now because they're already set at 100%.<br />
<br />
Wizards have a number of percent based AAs, not the least of which is the Crit percentage line. There is definitely a cap on how high that can go, especially considering out intention that a crit will not ever be a guaranteed event (so the cap is not 100% but something lower.) On top of that, still taking crit percentages as the example, you have to consider the other stackable abilities that increase this. The Ranger spell that increases Crit chance, for example, is a factor in how high wizard innate crit rates can go.<br />
<br />
The Ranger AA line he refers to is Hunter's Reconnaissance (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=11231&amp;source=Live)  which increases spell critical chance.  It is also likely, they consider the Bard 1.5 / 2.0 clicks such as Spirit of Vesagran. (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6271&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
While wizards have innately higher critical chances then we do, it is likely that we will always be some percentage of thier max chance, so we are likewise limited by these effects.<br />
<br />
It's not to far a leap to assume the same is the case for Healing Criticals and possibly even +damage from spell effects.<br />

One would hope that the developers figured this out as soon as the idea of mudflation became widely known (or even before, since they are supposed to be on the cutting edge as developers).<br />
<br />
This is just another example of mudflation.<br />
<br />
They have put limits on various spells, like Slow, Complete Heal, etc., to deal with this kind of thing.  I have no doubt that there will be a limit on how high of a percent they will allow us to crit heals and damage.  Once we reach that limit, they will just offer other AAs or decide that our crits only work on level 75 and lower spells and that when they raise the level cap again, we have to buy a new set for the new spells.<br />
<br />
I still have the vast majority of my focus effects with a level cap of 70.  I still  use level 70 or lower spells most of the time because of this.<br />
<br />
Once they reach the percent cap on crits, they can always still have AAs that increase the base spell damage instead of critting.  There is no limit on that.</div></div><hr />
