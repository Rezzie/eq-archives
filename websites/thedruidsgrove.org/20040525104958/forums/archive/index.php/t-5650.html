<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ladred</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I've had more time out of Everquest lately, I've decided to install a few old games that I didn't quite get into on the first sitting.<br />
<br />
I've been playing Rise of Nations, conquer the world for a few days now, yes the same game. Let me explain a little. Imagine the game Risk, where as you have a world map and turn based situation of taking territories. Now include an RTS empire builder onto that, where as you have to play out each territory conquest, and challenge in an RTS empire building game. Yes, conquering the world take a LONG time.<br />
<br />
Each territory conquest can take anywhere from one hour to several hours just depending on how fast you build, and how strong your opponent is.<br />
<br />
Add on custom scenarios to it, and there just seems to be a lot of game there. I've found several single player scenarios and multiplayer scenarios and have had serious fun with them, although some have been a bit frustrating to get.<br />
<br />
Anyhow if your looking for an interesting game to sink some time into, and you really like Risk. I'd suggest this. Also if you find some cool scenarios, link them here I love playing those things.</div></div><hr />
