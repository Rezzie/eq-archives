<br />
I am going to use the time in the mean time to get feedback on the effect.<br />
<br />
He may wish to cut back the power slightly for longer duration.  I want to know what people think of this in advance.<br />

<br />
Just out of curiosity.. is the 40% a mod to your current crit chance or a static increase?  IE... If I have a 10% chance to crit now.. is it 10% X 40% for a total of 14%?  Or is it 10% + 40% for a total of 50%?<br />
<br />
From my observations I would guess the latter.  I see probably between 40-50% crit rate while the rate is in effect.<br />
<br />
Based on this, I don't think that needs to be adjusted.  If the crit rate was 75% or more, then maybe I can see turning it down a bit.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />

Seems to work ok, I don't think much of the effect but like to have a fast cast nuke. If you want to alter the effect strength for longer duration okies, just leave cast time and spell strength alone, its not huge but it is useable in several situations as it is. Each to their own though.</div></div><hr />
