My name is Vindler and I am a Druid (or a Doodad/Durid...take your pick!!!) I've played a Druid in EQ for 6 yrs (Mith Marr then Saryrn servers)  and for the past 2 yrs or so I have been playing WoW. I currently reside on Kirin Tor and am in the guild Tal'mahe'Ra (Horde side). I am a Boomkin by choice and enjoying it every time I get to play.<br />

<br />
IRL I am married (my wife plays too...lucky me!!!) we have no kids yet but if we did they would play as well (LOL). I am currently working for Lockheed Martin as a Sr Technician. I retired from the Navy in 2003 following 21 yrs of service.<br />
<br />
I must say...it is good to see this site still going strong. Thank you Sobe for all you are still doing for the Druid Community.  <br />

He and I have teamed up to get TDG moving forward again. He's a business guy; I'm the techy. Good match.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindler</div><div class="date">11-15-2007, 06:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you both :) I was playing WoW in 06, but I haven't been active on these boards in a while. As you can see by my whopping post count, I don't post alot. This is alot for me, but I am stuck on ship atm and I am unable to play...so I troll troll the forums alot more. Mostly I research where I am going to take my characters (direction wise in game) when I am able to play.</div></div><hr />
