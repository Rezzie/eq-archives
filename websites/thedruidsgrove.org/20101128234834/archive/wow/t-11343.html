<br />
All the other talents say what % chance there is but does anyone know exactly what percentage 'the chance' is of entering this state in omen of clarity?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

I don't know the specific numerical chance, but in my experience it happens more often than you would think.  When farming the twilight guys in Silithus, I'd say I got 2-3 clearcastings per twilight guy.  HtH</div></div><hr />

Ive had it proc 3 hits in a row, while in cat form, and other times I have gone a few kills and it not proc once. Great talent for feral druids, just not enough points right now so I chose Mangle.</div></div><hr />

I find the samething as Goa, this talent has always been WONDERFUL for soloing/grinding especially if you are resto and cant sacrifice the points to put any into Feral. I also LOVE the new 30min duration.</div></div><hr />

The way Omen of Clarity works is that, for 30 minutes, each of your melee attacks has a chance for you to get a 10 second buff called Clearcasting.  Clearcasting means the next skill you use, if you use it by the time the buff runs out, costs no rage, energy, or mana.<br />
<br />
30 minutes of free skills would be nice :) but this is pretty nice, too and it can make all the difference in a fight.<br />
<br />
I, too, sacrificed OoC in my build...I'm 5/41/5...sacrificed for Mangle and for Natures Grasp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it was a major part of my raiding build before the new talents.  Now, OoC does not provide the same dps boost that mangle does.  As a result, it got the axe until much later (lvl 65 i think).  To many other useful things, particularly being a bear tank.<br />
<br />
On that note, I did Chromaggus last night, only to discover that timelapse is ridiculously resistable.  Every single timelapse, someone resisted (sometimes as many as 5 people resisted it).  I know I resisted it twice, once causing a quick shift to bear and some mass panic as &quot;OMG, Rel's got it.  Can you get it off him?  Or does he have to tank now?&quot;  Two timelapses later, the tank got chrommy back and i went back to the exciting world of  decursing and mangling.</div></div><hr />
