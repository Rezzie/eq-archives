<br />
Let's say you lose all your rank.  Can you still use your trinket that you earned for being a grunt?<br />
<br />
(I have some friends who want to reroll and I don't want to come back to my toon and not be able to use my pvp rewards).</div></div><hr />

You should only need to have had the rank at one point in time to use it.</div></div><hr />

All you need is the rank to get said item and you can then drop down to wherever. Pretty common for people to cycle the high warlord/grand marshall title after they get the gear with friends or guildies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-13-2006, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Jimmay is right, you only have to have the rank when you buy and equip it the first time.<br />
<br />
It would be pretty insane if the only way you could use the highwarlord gear is by always being the only high warlord.</div></div><hr />

I haven't entered the BG's again until about two weeks ago - I've never lost Private and I've never lost the ability to use my l33t Private's Tabbard  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayze</div><div class="date">03-14-2006, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there isn't an honor decay system?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">03-14-2006, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is an honor decay system, its just impossible to drop off of it completely (ie there is nothing below private).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">03-14-2006, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">u can continue to use the items from the highest rank u've obtained, even if u lose all your ranks from inactivity. :]</div></div><hr />

I was Rank 4 (Necklace Reward) and went away for 5 weeks. Upon my return I was half way down Rank 3 (Cloak reward) and can still use my Necklace. I have tried unequiping it and re-equiping and all is fine.</div></div><hr />
