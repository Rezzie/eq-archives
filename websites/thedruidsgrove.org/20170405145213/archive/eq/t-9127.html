<br />
Im looking for some help finding a Druid wearable robe for my druid who is expecting a marriage proposal soon :p. As far as my limited knowledge takes me I cant recall ever seeing a Druid robe, but I was hoping that someone had some ideas.<br />
<br />
As far as it goes..any armor that can be dyed white may also work, but I would really like a robe. Stats are completely irrelevant, but I would prefer as cheap as possible :p<br />
<br />
Any married druids out there have some help for me?</div></div><hr />

There is a crystal covered shroud (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3940) that looks like a gown, but it's wearable only by human druids.</div></div><hr />

If so, you're out of luck.  Wood elves do not have a robe graphic available to them.  If you really want to wear a robe, buy a ten-shot human illusion potion.  Otherwise the white armor would be ok.  There's the tradeskilled Shade Silk Robe that anyone can wear.  Also, you could kill Shainai in Shar Vahl for the nightie.</div></div><hr />
