<br />
(11-28) 12:32 PST New York (AP) -- A Wal-Mart worker was killed Friday after an &quot;out of control&quot; throng of shoppers eager for post-Thanksgiving bargains broke down the doors at a suburban store and knocked him to the ground, police said.<br />
<br />
Nassau police said about 2,000 people were gathered outside the store doors at the mall about 20 miles east of Manhattan. The impatient crowd knocked the man to the ground as he opened the doors, leaving a metal portion of the frame crumpled like an accordion.<br />
<br />
&quot;This crowd was out of control,&quot; said Nassau police spokesman Lt. Michael Fleming. He described the scene as &quot;utter chaos.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dozens of store employees trying to fight their way out to help the man were also getting trampled by the crowd, Fleming said. Witnesses said that even as the worker lay on the ground, shoppers streamed into the store, stepping over him.<br />
<br />
Kimberly Cribbs, who witnessed the stampede, said shoppers were acting like &quot;savages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When they were saying they had to leave, that an employee got killed, people were yelling 'I've been on line since yesterday morning,'&quot; she said. &quot;They kept shopping.&quot;Imagine that, being trampled to death by a ravenous herd of obese suburbanites streaming out of their SUVs.  It'd be funny if it weren't so pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, it is New York, might be different out there, I might be wrong.<br />
<br />
But they don't usually have SUVs.<br />
<br />
1992 Toyota Corollas more like it.<br />

I have done a WalMart Black Sunday as an Associate.  Nasty!</div></div><hr />

Chuck vs. I forget what had a pretty good depiction of this day from season one. Here is to the holiday spirit! I am very glad I am agnostic. FYI though out here in Tenn, particularly the rural towns, Wal Mart is the spot, so you kinda see allittle bit of everything out here. Escalades(really just a yukon with different plates, leather interior, some extra horsepower, and a few other features, anyways), trucks(lots and lots), Suv's, clunkers, regular passenger cars.</div></div><hr />

And not the people who actually caused the injury, but the deep pocket, Wal-Mart, no doubt on the theory that they were negligent because they didn't have a SWAT team on hand armed with automatic weapons to maintain crowd control.  (Ironically, if they had hired a SWAT team, and someone got hurt, they still would've gotten sued.  Damned if you do, damned if you don't, if you're a deep pocket in America.)<br />
<br />
http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,459844,00.htmlAttorney Jordan Hecht, who represents Damour's three sisters, said the family declined to make any public statements about the man's death. Funeral arrangements were pending, he said.<br />
<br />
Hecht said that he was considering a lawsuit but that no decision had been made. Two other injured shoppers filed a notice of claim Monday, the first step toward proceeding with a lawsuit.</div></div><hr />
