I guess just wondering on your opinions.</div></div><hr />

Mp5<br />

Mana gained per tick - Spirit/4.5 + 15 <br />
Mana gained per tick per spirit - 1/4.5<br />

Remember, this is after the 5 second &quot;no casting&quot; rule takes into effect.<br />
<br />
While most Resto pieces already have a bunch of spirit on them, finding them with Mp5 is a bit trickier.<br />
<br />
I usually keep a few pieces of high Mp5 gear in my bag and toss it on for a fight that I know takes a while.<br />
<br />
(ZG Raptor Boss used to be a prime example of this.)<br />
<br />
Before I specc'd Feral I was regen'ing close to 200 mana per tick and after popping trinkets and Innervate....it was insane.</div></div><hr />
