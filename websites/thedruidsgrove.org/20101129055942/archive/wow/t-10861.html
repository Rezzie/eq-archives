<br />
The highlight of the 4 or 5 matches we did had to be when we all started out at the bottom of our ramp and assisted one of the druids for a target. When the target got into range, BAM 10 Moonfires on him, probably had about 3k+ damage initially and he lasted til the first tick of the dot! Wish I had gotten a screenshot of that...</div></div><hr />

I would love to be a part of a 10 Druid WSG!  I bet it was a blast!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-18-2006, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it was a lot of fun. At first you might think a 10 druid WSG would own, but as we soon found out when put up against a solid team, our lack of crowd control and burst DPS is a real liability. Getting their flag to our base wasn't a problem, but trying to get ours back from a FR with a couple priests/locks was impossible. Nerf fear.</div></div><hr />

QFT.<br />

Although you can break fear every 5 mins with the PvP trinket, so it's slightly less annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-18-2006, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also....I believe after they fear 3 times you become more resistant to it....so that helps.  UD have it easy....WotF and the PvP trinket!  They need an UD Druid...LOL<br />
<br />
Can you imagine a skeletal bear and cat? LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hadyn</div><div class="date">07-18-2006, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the PvP trinkets had different effects for each class, and the one for Druids was  Fear, Charm, and Stun. <br />
<br />
Your UD Druid idea reminds me of something:<br />
Will Blood Elves and Draeni be able to be Druids? It's kinda pathetic that only two races in the game can be Druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-18-2006, 12:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They do have different effects for some classes...my boyfriend has a UD Rogue and it's the fear charm....that's why I mentioned that.  He has the trinket and WotF to give him 2 free get out of fear cards.</div></div><hr />

He's never worried about the locks....since he can get outta it twice.  That's why he says that UD is the best race for Rogues....that and Cannabilize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">07-18-2006, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have loved to see that many druids at one time.  I feel lucky when I get to follow another cheetah across the field.<br />
<br />
If you could hold the turtle having entire recovery teams stealth in would be really cool though.   Just out of curiousity did you have any Moonkins?  They might have helped with your burst dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">07-18-2006, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had one moonkin :p<br />
<br />
We sent the ferals and moonkin in to get the flag back, but with no way to cc their healers and counteract fear (trinkets are great, but when you have a flagroom with a warrior, warlock and a couple priests, gg) we just couldn't sustain enough DPS to drop the warrior holding our flag.</div></div><hr />

A whole WSG of druids. Druids are really one of the least played classes in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

So I got into bear form and sat with em for like 15 min or so talkin :)<br />

All druid wsg would be an awesome thing to be a part of.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance hardley ever get a flag cap on us and have come to love my /tickle ravage macro lol.  I play D, another plays mid, one always goes for flag (cheers for free action pots!) and the rest fill in where needed.<br />
