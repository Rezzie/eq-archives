Just don't allow personal attacks.. like your a f'ing loser! or anything to that effect.. but sometimes.. a debate will go on about how the game sucks or some jerk in game stole my blah bling.. and well this is the place for it.<br />
 <br />
 We will sometimes move threads into here that the moderators and Admin feel is a bit .. rantish.. the system works and it keeps the General WoW section clean of those types of post, and allows those that have great concerns about &quot;this or that rant&quot; to be visable and not get lost to the wave of General WoW Post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
by eliminating the biggest threat..   Humans, Gnolls, Barbarians, etc...   They believed in a more &quot;Natural&quot; state of being &quot;Unkept&quot;.   I think that is what you were saying just not sure.  <br />
<br />
Kind of like ELF (Earth Liberation Front) today...  Kill the humans to save the trees.  An alternate view that may not be mainstream to any other logical or sane person.   And hence the heated debates not to be entered into by sensitive or politically correct individuals.</div></div><hr />
