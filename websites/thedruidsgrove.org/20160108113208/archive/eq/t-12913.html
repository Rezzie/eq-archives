It seems if I do nothing other than sic a dire charmed rat on a caster type, I still become the primary target and the mob starts casting on me instead of pet.<br />
<br />
I know that snares, dots and heals etc will cause agro, but what makes the mob instantly target me instead of pet if I do nothing other than command the pet to attack?  Only thing I can think of is a ds, or perhaps the fact that it is DC'd as opposed to just charmed?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

Sitting build a lot aggro especially when sending pets ;) Something a good friend of me had learned way back when Velious come out in Velks on the hard tour.<br />
Every time he send his pet in and did not stand up in befor he get so much aggo that the tank had a hard time to get the agro back.</div></div><hr />
