<br />
I am a young druid in training, just barely past the 23rd mark in the long journey. I also am new to the land of Azeroth, having awaken from the dream but 10 days ago. I thought I had a handle on my skills, I had direction, I had purpose, I had many wonderful tomes of knowledge full of suggestions on how to be the best I can be.<br />
<br />
I was following the old ways... I beleive it was called 0/50/11... I rather love the feel of being an animal, the wind in my hair running as a cat.. the fear in others as I let out a loud roar as bear.. <br />
<br />
Now I am at a loss... everything has changed, the world feels diffrent as if some great force has forced us all to relearn what we knew. And I am at a complete loss, I am not sure how to train now to be the best I can.. I had just barely achieved an omen of clarity and now I see many do not wish to gain such inner peace while allowing the feral part within to dominate the body. <br />
<br />
So I come to you, the wise elders, hoping to find some guidance as to what I should be working towards now... How to best be prepared for the many challenges the land has... where best to place my study in order to face the evils and work towards being prepared for the lich kings return.<br />

((basically I was following the old best for leveling feral, and now i'm not sure if that's what I should be following.. or if there is a better path now...))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Purely for a leveling spec and not for doing raiding etc I'd use something like the following:<br />

<br />
That gives you a lot of solid damage.  Increases your healing for when you have to pop out and heal and then gives you a great deal of burst damage as you progress.  Once you get past 70 you can really fill out and add to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I think we are all in the same boat now, nobody is really sure what is best yet.  I guess I would recommend getting all the feral talents first, as these are the most likely to affect your grinding speed.<br />

At that point, I'd pick-up 3/5 Furor for 75 energy every time I shift into cat (so that you'd have plenty of energy to start a fight as soon as you dismounted, shifted from travel form, shifted back from a self-heal, etc.).  Then continue back in the Feral tree (focusing on DPS talents) until I pick-ed up mangle.  Then I'd take 4/5 Furor, 1/2 iMotW, 5/5 Intensity and 1/1 OoC (at level 61).  Then focus on taking 5/5 RnT as it awesome while leveling.<br />

After that, well?  Call us when you make it that far and we'll talk.</div></div><hr />
