<br />
My fiance plays a druid on Hellscream and I'm helping her customize her UI just as I recently did with my hunter.<br />
<br />
We were both using Cosmos for its simplicity but now we need something more effective.  I'm using a mix of CT and Titan with a couple extra hunter specific mods thrown in.<br />
<br />
I tried looking for druid mods but the pickins I found at curse-gaming really seem to suck.<br />
<br />
These are the features she's looking for..<br />
<br />
she resto spec and loves the healing role (her alt is a priest but she loved the druid more, hehe).  She wants something that makes buffing/healing easier and less mouse/hotkey heavy.<br />
<br />
So, I currently have her setup with a mix of CT/Titan and a bare minimal Cosmos (mainly, the buff and cast options MOD).<br />
<br />
If anyone has any suggestions pls let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other druid specifics, I cannot think of ones geared towards healing though:<br />
- Druid Timer ( estimates time for roots, bash, pounce )<br />
- Druidbar ( see your estimated mana when in feral forms )</div></div><hr />

 Back on topic, I like Item Rack too as most any druid will have a few sets of armour they will switch back and forth on, this makes it very easy. Also ICU for tracking, ICU is a must.<br />
Btw most guilds require people to use ct-raid so you might as well get use to using it.</div></div><hr />

Well There were many mods i used, as a druid, before the patch, not neccesarily for Resto Spec, but it was a complete druid mod that did literally everything you wanted it to do, its called Complete Druid, I found it on curse gaming, it doesnt work as far as i know, but If you manage to find an updated version, use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repelsteel</div><div class="date">05-09-2006, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have used DruidPartyHeal (DPH) for a while, the old (http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=1384) and outdated version even worked with the latest 1.9.x, or 1.10 version (can't remember), I see there's a new (http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2396) revamped beta version out now.<br />
<br />
And yes itemrack is a nice mod, I'm feral but carry my healing gear aswell and with one button I can switch my complete gear. Also handy are the events in this mod: when I mount I automatically put on my boots with Mithril Spurs and Carrot on a Stick (make a set first with these items), and when I'm gonna drink a pot of mana it will put on my neckless and dagger with +mana/5 sec (another set). Also when I dismount/stop drinking the original items will be put back.<br />
<br />
Don't know the other mods here, but they look interesting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kunen</div><div class="date">05-09-2006, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked everywhere for a mod that could do auto heals.  I haven't tryed it yet cuz I am waiting for WOW to fix the realm.  But I searched GOOGLE for &quot;Druid Party Heal&quot; and a list of sites that you can DL it pop'd up.  I hope it works!? :epopcorn: <br />
The info about it makes it the Resto Druids best friend!  I hope this helps.  The version I found was 2.1.  Good Luck!:texla:</div></div><hr />

I believe they did a huge cleanup of their mod database too. I see 27 different mods on there for druids, haven't really played a druid too much so I'm not sure which ones are really usefull, but the site does look, and run a lot better now. :)</div></div><hr />
