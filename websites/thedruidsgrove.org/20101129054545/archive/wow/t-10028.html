<br />
My spec is 14-31-5 feral. About 5300 life in bear / 3600 cat and about 8000 armor. In BGs i do just great healing when needed, rooting when needed and fighting when needing i am a fast shifter using all the forms all the time depending what is needed.<br />
<br />
But when i fight OneVsOne is not the same.<br />
<br />
I have not too much trouble with warriors and rogues, I win them 80-20 % but with any other class i lose 60-40% or 70-30%.<br />
<br />
For example there are some strange things as I win several times agains epic hunter ata a rate of 90-10% but there was a hunter lvl 55 i could not beat him any fight of 5-6 duels we made. I know is strange but it is true.<br />
<br />
Agains mages I had big problems killing them as from the start i could not survive the first burst of dmg the fire me and as soon as i try healing then silence a little more dmg and i am death. I realized i needed some more +stm so i could afford in a better way that huge dmg i should get in the begining at things got much much better but no yet enough.<br />
<br />
I will aprecitate any tips you can give me to became better.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot adb sorry for my english.<br />
If there is any post in other forums for this issue please copy to here as i can not see them becouse my company firewall</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a duel I would still tryo to close on them as they won't really be able to start casting till the timer ends anyway.  Dash is good for keeping on them whenthey blink.  IF you want to turtle down and try to swallow the first wave (not my choice), put a HoT on yourself, then go bear for the extra health, as the timer goes down hit enrage and close to melee, he'll blink to get some range, feral charge to close again and bash, shift heal, cat rip his face off.</div></div><hr />

However they make some pots that absorb damage, some of the higher ones are expensive though I believe, and of course there is the ethic of using these pots depending on the rules before hand.

2 minute recast like most pots, but they last an hour, I'll use them if I think I'll need an extra edge in pvp.<br />
I'm pretty interested in a strategy vs a warlock it seems I'm always perma feared. The times I've been able to beat them was when I got in some good crits right off the back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if we are talking duels.. against mages I just sack all my armor for more health/resistances.. and HoT+HoT myself as the duel countdown starts.. pretty much 99% win against equally equipped foes..</div></div><hr />

Wow.  The druid placed a rejuv. on himself and kept healing. and before you know the mage was OOM.  Druid at full hp and close to full mana.  Hahahahah.  Resto rocks.  <br />
<br />
But epic hunteres still give me trouble.  I can take most warriors so long as they're not all epic'ed.  Rogues pose no problem whatsoever.  Although the stun locking rogues can get annoying.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on shadow priests.  They eat me alive.  Can't even get through their bubble before mind flay, vampiric embrace, fear, dot, etc.  Then silence when I try to heal.  And if I'm still alive and can pull off a regrowth, they can debuff everything.  Ugh.<br />
<br />
What class is meant to beat a shadow priest anyways?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Engineers. :D<br />
<br />
I have more problems with warlocks tbh.. but shadow priests are surely a close second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For Mages same thing i dont make dirty tricks to win them in duel i just try to simulate what would happen I i find one 40 yards away and start attacking me. <br />
<br />
Same with any other class i like to simulate i am ganked and try to survive the situation and kill the ganker</div></div><hr />

I just out-heal them and have never had a problem against mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">02-10-2006, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did some dueling last night down in Gadget.<br />
<br />
first I took down a warrior 4 levels higher than me.  I find the key tactic is roots and spell damage.  Kiting them helps a lot against their powerful physical attacks, and virtually eliminates their special attacks.  Spell damage isn't mitigated by AC, so once their rooted and the SF, MF, wrath start falling they freak as their health drops away.<br />
<br />
then I tore up a rogue two levels higher than me, the key to rogues is surving the initial onslaught.  I lucked out and got a FF on him just as the duel started, then NG and MF.  He attacked and got rooted, I backed off and dropped a SF, wrath, and another MF (I like to time it so the follow-up MF hits the same time the wrath arrives at the target).  The next time he came at me my Green Whelp Armor got him, so I shifted healed, shifted back to Moonkin and dropped another SF on him, from there it was two quick MF's and he was out.</div></div><hr />
