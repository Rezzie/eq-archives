<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DeraChrist</div><div class="date">06-01-2009, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all. I played EQ1 years ago, quitting back in 2003, and I haven't found a game that comes close yet. I've been fortunate enough to be with the same guild throughout my gaming experience, and its always been fun; the people were great, but it was the game itself that was lacking. <br />
 <br />
We started out in EQ1 on Brell, formed &lt;Pandemonium&gt; in EQ2 on the Venekor server, and took off from there. We have since crushed AoC, WoW, Darkfall, etc... But it just wasn't the same. <br />
 <br />
We will be forming up on the new 51/50 server and playing the classics for nostalgia. We are planning on leveling upto 65 and raiding all the stuff you loved years ago, then progress in level from there. After all, if its not challenging it's just NOT fun. I remember actually having fun taking down dragons in NToV, getting hit by that HORRIBLE curse from Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune, being mauled by the Avatar of War, and racing to kill all 4 Dark Masters in the Umbral Planes to spawn Doomshade... We want to do this again. <br />
 <br />
If you wanted to just hit level 85 and mow through stuff intended to be raided by players 20 levels below you stay on an old server and have at it, but if you want to come back and play the game as it was intended check us out at http://www.addictguild.com (http://www.addictguild.com) . If you like what you see in the public EQ section take a minute to register and post a hello.<br />
 <br />
We look forward to hearing from you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've got 34 solid characters signed up and a few more still deciding on what class to play. We should be doing real raid targets within a week of the server launch. Check the forums out @ http://www.addictguild.com<br />
 <br />
Currently we are looking for a couple more Druids and DPS classes, though Clerics and Knights are welcome as well.</div></div><hr />

Lastnight was our first trip into Phase5. Got everything on the first engagement, then wiped to Quarm at 2%... fixed our cure issues and downed him. <br />
**** for loots, but whatever, we got the suffix title &quot;of the Timebreakers&quot;<br />
<br />
STILL looking for more Druids</div></div><hr />
