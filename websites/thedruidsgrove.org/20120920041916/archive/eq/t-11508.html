<br />
Druid level 70 <br />
 <br />
Description: <br />
4: Decrease Movement by 50%<br />
 <br />
Recourse Effect: Hungry Vines Recourse <br />
1: Mitigate Melee Damage by 20%, 1600 total<br />
9: Increase Damage Shield by 45<br />
 <br />
Yet, since this is a level 70 spell and has to come from OOW or DoN, it isn't listed there as one you get for turning in Glowing or Ancient Runes.  Nor is it what you get from DoN faction quests, that is the 61 and 69 snare spells.<br />
<br />
So does this spell exist?  If it does, how do you get it?</div></div><hr />

Sorry for not checking the TDG sticky but there are so many different places to check.  And TDG spell list has some errors in it too.<br />
<br />
AllaKhazam's didn't have this spell listed as a Glowing Rune turn in.  I normally use their lists rather than TDG because they are easier to use and there is just one list rather than the five or however many on TDG.<br />
<br />
If someone at TDG wants me to fix the lists here, I'll be happy to do so.  Because there should be just one listing, not all the ones that are here.<br />
<br />
For example, this list http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=7624 doesn't have it.  It also has Desolate Summoned listed as level 70 when it is really 68.<br />
<br />
Since I am aware that you guys are really busy and stuff, I don't expect it to be perfect but I thought you should know I wasn't just being lazy.</div></div><hr />
