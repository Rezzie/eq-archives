<br />
Having not seen this before I check all my lists and it was not there yet was in the spell database going into live 08/06,  so I checked the test server and it was a modification of Pack Mongoose which makes it seem to be a LDoN spell.<br />
<br />
I know its a minor spell just wondering why it hasn't been mentioned here yet.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing this spell means that curses are going to be introduced on lower level mobs now.</div></div><hr />

It's looking like Shaman are going to be given a line of Curse-based DoTs.  If mobs are going to be able to cast the lower level spells in that line, lower level folks are going to have to be able to cure them.  ;) <br />
<br />
As for why it hasn't been mentioned here... I think those are the LDoN spells.  It's sounding like the spell list is going to be similar to LoY... mid-level spells (some lower) that close up gaps.  I guess there just hasn't been much discussion (particularly of this spell) because it's not causing much excitement.</div></div><hr />
