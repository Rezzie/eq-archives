I quit in the fall of 2006. I recall there was only one decent place to kite for a lvl 61 Druid and it was someo place in OOW.<br />
Now that everyone is either at 80 or gringing towards 80, does anyone have decent places to either solo kite, or quad kite (Once i practice again)......in any of the expansions.<br />
Just looking for fun, experience, and maybe some loot.<br />
By the way, where does this Deifance armor drop and what basically is good about Defiance armor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gokusan</div><div class="date">07-02-2008, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defiant gear drops from pretty much anything. The level of the armor corresponds to the level of the monster that dropped it (high lvl mobs drop better stuff).<br />
 <br />
As for good places to kill, dranik's scar perhaps? You can also try BoT, you can't solo there but there are still people in that zone at any given time. It's a much easier place to camp too now that even average players stand up to the mobs a lot better.<br />
 <br />
As for quad kiting, I reccomend against it. I'm not saying you can't, but don't get too comfortable. Druids get no quad kite aoe upgrade after 65. Apparently we were not intended to be able to quad kite. ... Yea, which is why we get targeted aoe nukes, and targeted aoe snare... &lt;&lt; I believe that..</div></div><hr />

I think I had something like 2500 hp and 4000 mana unbuffed back then.<br />
<br />
You might be able to kite in level-appropriate zones in the Serpent's Spine (maybe Goru`kar Mesa?).  TSS was generally pretty good for kiting.<br />
<br />
I forget what level is required to zone in to the Plane of Fire without a flag, but that may be worth a look, along with the Plane of Water if you can tolerate fighting underwater.<br />
<br />
Riwwi might be worth a look, being a hotzone.<br />
<br />
Oh!  How could I forget--Crypt of Nadox is also a hotzone.  It is another good zone for charming as a druid, and you can pick up a Sand Eroded Shell if you don't have one already.  The pigs that are charmable at 61 aren't as powerful as the Exhausted Bloodtusk you can charm at 63, though.</div></div><hr />

It ma not have been so good for you first time around, but i guarantee you it is now - especially as the mobs have relatively few hps.<br />
Xp/time will be better here than in other zones.<br />
<br />
My 67 Sk is getting about 3aa/hour solo just on lb and green cons</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">07-02-2008, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It also depends on what part of the zone you hunt in.<br />
The northwest part of the zone has mobs in the low and mid 50's; some should be dark blue to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt want to start a new string and drive u nuts LOL...........i wanted to know your opinion.........I want to PL a new character, what class can solo almost as good as a Druid, that I can PL from lvl 1 up.<br />
Can a Beastlord solo (i want to PL, but i like to logon at times and just solo the new character). <br />
Can BeastlOrds solo from lvl 1 thru lvl 50? I was just concerned because they dont seem to have CC. Are Necros the only alternative who can solo with CC capabilities? I know SK's can solo, but going toe to toe is just tough, I used to solo a lvl 24 DE SK and it got tough, lots of downtime as well.<br />
So whats your opinion on what class I should choose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elligen</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mention PL and solo in the same breath so I'm not sure if you running two acounts or whether the new toon will be on the same account as the druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
<br />
Depends on what you want from the new toon.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want a fun class who can solo, then yeah BL is good fun and can solo past your stated mark of 50 easily.<br />
<br />
Necros however are the overall kings of soloing.<br />
<br />
If you want something that can tank to duo with your druid - then a warrior is your best bet in terms of your survivability and can do decent dps.<br />
<br />
SK and Pally both do not tank as well as a warrior, but are easier on the healing due to their spells which can help healing themselves/group.<br />
They both have their own merits.<br />
<br />
Druid is not the optimal partner for a plate class, due to healing inefficiencies or lack of slow - however, it can work well if you get decent gear/AA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for quick reply, I will be running 2 accounts but on the same computer, so i have to keep minimizing one screen, and bringing up the other. So i really can only PL, not really truely 2-box. I wont have control of both characters at the same exact time. I will use the heals and buffs from lvl 61 druid on the new toon.<br />
I do have items from old friends who left the game. I have Hogresh Beads (spelled wrong i think) for Necros and SK's plus I have a Manastone, so maybe a Necro in the old world zones would be better than a BL, or are those beads and manastone useless these days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Due to the introduction of shroud form, class is not a problem if you only want to solo to level 50.  I think you should get a shaman first to combine potions for your toons.  Then for the toon you want to PL, shroud him to a bear warrior. With shaman DS potion + POK haste potion (distillate of alacrity) + druid buff, you can easily PL any char to level 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the Shroud forms were just for monster missions? I could take a necro, go into bear warrior form, and it will be like i am power levelling a warrior?</div></div><hr />

Many people use the goblin one to sneak around for exploration tasks since it's an SoS rogue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">07-05-2008, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The goblin rogue shroud doesn't actually give you the Shroud of Stealth ability.  What it does give you is the ability to be invisible to live and undead mobs at the same time, which is still useful on rare occasions.  (Part of the Duskmold task comes to mind, for example.)<br />
<br />
Try sneaking as a goblin rogue in Ashengate.  The mobs will still see you, even though real rogues can move around unseen.</div></div><hr />

Successful SOS will give you a sound, but sill within this range there are at least two grades. Always con NPCs to see if it's fully successful; if not, recast SOS.</div></div><hr />
