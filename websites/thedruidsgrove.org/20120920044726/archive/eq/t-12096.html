You say, 'Hail, Brother Hidden Path <br />
<br />
Brother Hidden Path says 'Jarzarrad told me of this day, the day I would meet the Half Elf that would learn the secrets of [Shadowspine]. Funny, I always thought you would be taller. . .' <br />
<br />
Brother Hidden Path says 'Shadowspine is the carnivorous spell book penned by the ancient master of Dreadspire Keep. Many have attempted to learn the secrets it holds, few survived and fewer still carry on with any shred of sanity. There are rumors though, rumors of rare individuals who have escaped the jaws of Shadowspine with a fragment of the tome's power. Perhaps with the author's permission? Perhaps not? Regardless, Jarzarrad foresees that you will be one of those individuals. He has instructed me to [help] you.' <br />
<br />
Brother Hidden Path says 'I served the Shiliskin Empire as a translator before I found my way to Jarzarrad. I can unriddle any language you bring to me, no matter how old or how archaic. If you recover any transcribed pages of Shadowspine, I can translate them into the arcane tongue so you can use them in your spellbook. I know not why Jarzarrad has instructed me to help you, but he has foreseen many coming centuries and he has lived through many more. Who are we to question his motives?' <br />

Your Location is -893.10, 751.41, 90.61 <br />

This mob is in a camp located in the Undershore (2nd zone into DoD). As you zone in, turn to the left and cross a couple of bridges. You will fins a camp of mind flayers at the /loc above. There are also other mobs there. One seems to give out a task for single players, with the result being an intelligent weapon of some sort. Another gives out group missions, and another gives out raids.</div></div><hr />

If these are SoEs way of making the OoW runes easier to get then that is kinda sad imo.  Also, if that is the case, then where are the DoD spells?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
We saw 8 Greater, 1 Glowing, and 1 regular Shadowspine Rune.<br />
 <br />
These mobs are as hard if not harder than RSS mobs.  If your group can exp there, then you can handle RSS.  That is why I feel this is kinda sad that they came up with this &quot;alternative&quot;<br />
 <br />
Also, what prior expansion have you ever had runes/spells drop from previous expansions?  I am not talking about added recipes for researching, I mean, where in OoW could you get GoD spells? in GoD where can you find PoP spells? where in PoP did you find Luclin or Velious spells??  It doesn't seem to me to make any sense to do that.<br />
 <br />
Even when spells were similar and mixed in levels, Kunark spells you had to go to Kunark to get, or find them in the bazaar.</div></div><hr />

If you need 69 spells, zone into RSS and sit there a few. You will see them ooc'd. If not, perhaps ask in ooc for a tell if a Greater is rotting. I personally hate to see any runes rot. When asked I have no problem sending a tell to someone stating a rune is available.</div></div><hr />
