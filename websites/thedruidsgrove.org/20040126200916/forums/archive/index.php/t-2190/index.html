<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Whisperglade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there spots in BOT where you can solo?  I know the Stormriders dont summon but they are so close together unsure if you can kill them solo?<br />
<br />
Any ideas? or known tactics?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gatori Vonhinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The basic answer is no.<br />
<br />
There will likely be someone that comes along and says you can solo the stormriders or profets or something.  They are theoretically correct, but there are MUCH better places out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Woodix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We can solo in BoT, when you port up behind the named (wich wings doesnt matter) run to the south corner.<br />
Timing the repop and using harmony that will be safe if you manage well.<br />
The interest hunting there is that stomriders can drop Spectral parchement(not that often, droprate near uncommon i think), but as said  gatori i dont think for exp it woth it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Whisperglade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can you elaborate on the MUCH better places to solo - I used to solo in HOH - but with the patch that makes mobs summon now I have no where to solo at 65.  Any ideas would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok what is so hard bout soloing HoH? Pull with snare, root (non damage), dot... if he starts summoning you have 10 seconds to run a few steps and cast a 5 seconds spell. <br />
<br />
Yeah the nurf sux, I hate it too. That doesnt seem to matter to SOE. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xytrani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually for the mobs that summon in HoH, I still just root rot them. Stack the dots, then every 3rd summon or so heal instead of nuke. mana usually isn't a problem if you keep swarming death and fury or I'm sorry 'illumination' running on the soldiers. It drains your mana bar pretty low, but is doable and gets a summoner out of the way. <br />
<br />
My only gripe is that the days of quadding are forever gone because while I can deal with one mob that hits for 500 pounding me when I get summoned, 9 times out of 10, 4 of them will kill me before I finish read 'You will not evade me....'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kanus Silverleaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So what was the Nerf in HoH?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aluaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Things randomly summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bippwinno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">whats the maxdamage approx when you get summoned? do they stun a lot? how often do they summon?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SuburbanLife</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey folks,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to let you know that I was duo-ing the Stormriders upstairs with a good druid friend of mine and the aaxp/xp is pretty decent.  They drop fast because they have low HP, the only issue is the clerical ones that CH themselves and cast that Reckoning spell on you.  <br />
<br />
Just have your MR up maybe some gear to give you a little boost, and both of you should keep Storm's Fury memmed and when the critter starts to CH just alternate casts like every 5 seconds or so.  In between you need to cast your dot's to make sure the fooker goes down.   Some of them do gate as well, so you gotta watch out for that.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps some of ya who have a good druid pal in game, it is really fast fun xp, and if you have a horse you can pretty much med the whole time, we never dipped below 60% mana unless a CH went off.  And I don't have insane gear (yet) so I am pretty sure the majority of druids could camp here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Clakar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Next question is how do you get there? :p  .<br />
<br />
To answer a question above:<br />
<br />
Max damage without stun is probably near the 1200hp or greater mark, double 500 hit and a kick can get you dead pretty quick.  If you get stunned or for whatever reason go through two rounds of abuse, your could easliy find yourself 2000hp less.  Alot depends on the level mob your fighting.<br />
<br />
Regarding how often they summon, well just like anthing else, about the 10-12 second mark.<br />
<br />
I've not tried to solo there but I have gotten agro early from heals and gone through maybe 4-5 hits/kicks and found my HP from full bar to two bubs in maybe 2-5 seconds.  This being non-slowed mobs btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Luclin server the mobs no longer randomly summons in HoH, at least not the ones I have been killing. It was changed back few days after the patch.</div></div><hr />
