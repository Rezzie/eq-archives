<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iluani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone solo their own fungi yet?  Going to try next time i'm bored just wondering how tough the camp is, i haven't been there in ages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think this &lt;strong&gt;might&lt;/strong&gt; be a bit tough.  It seems feasible if you know the camp, but on thule atm, the only ones doing it solo seem to be necros.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nothar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This camp would be really tough to do solo even for a well equipped 65 Druid.<br />
<br />
I have tried this before and didnt have much luck.<br />
<br />
As far as i know, there is no way to split the King/PH and the 2 other Shrooms beside him on the platform with him by a Druid. If someone knows a way to get them solo(without a 2-boxed Pacification class etc.), i would be all ears.<br />
<br />
So expect to have at the minimum 3 Shrooms to deal with on the initial break. If you manage to crowd control the 3 Shrooms, you still have to deal with the fact that all of the Shrooms summon, so they arent exactly easy to solo without some risk (especially when root starts breaking on the adds while you are getting summoned).<br />
<br />
And the topper is that there are many wandering Shrooms in the area that may add, or worse yet cast CH thru walls on the Shroom that you are fighting.<br />
<br />
After a few unsuccessful attempts to break the camp and having to blow Egress/Exodus i gave up and decided that the risk for death wasnt worth it, especially considering the abysmal drop rate on the Fungi if you do happen to get the King to pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Emelia Sunheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have you tried &quot;Druid FD&quot;? =)<br />
<br />
Pull the king with Ensnare (although I'm not sure if he is snarable), wait till he's a safe distance away from his buddies' spawn points, and channel Egress.  Run back, and he should be alone, unless something dispels him.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Quick Evac is a great aa :)   <br />
<br />
edit: This would also work if you can keep the King and his friends rooted (but only the king snared) long enough to camp out - camp and wait a few min before logging back in though.  I think the shrooms are a bit too MR to keep rooted long though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tendalus Treepimp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nothing is worse than getting to 5 seconds to camp 5 times in a row when something break root and pops you... also, the casters make you stand, which sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Senkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I soloed this camp, was pain to set up and timing when to pull and how to react though. You need to know area well really. <br />
<br />
First i decided to clean zone out and pull king there, i killed a romarer frog pathing at zone out 2 doors (from the door which opens fungi area to ills jail door) and then cleaned inside zone out room, usually 2 frogs and 1 fungus pops, or 2 fungus 1 frog ...to my luck there were 2 fungus and 1 enchanter frog ) however this didnt work well really because of roamers no matter what i did i got unwanted adds. the adds i mean is from the spot where near water side, they path left and right. Good thing is almost none of them saw innate camo. This really helped alot.<br />
<br />
On first set up i cleaned zone out and waited roamer move away, climb up to the rock just by rock by the door which opens to fungi area waited patiently roamer move away, with flight of eagles on me i run straight over water area to Fungi King spot. You really need to be carefull here  because of 2 reasons : 1 ) there are 2 roamers 1 goes left and other goes right and you must be sure they dont see invis..if some of them see invis, just be patient , let him move away then move your set up camp spot 2) you must hug left after levitated over water to king area so you do not agro the mobs on platform where king and his 2 buddy spawns. <br />
<br />
After you arrive to king area, as i said you need hug left, u will see one opening on the left just not far away, skip it dont enter there and go across to a spot where there is a corner you will see. That is your camp spot. <br />
<br />
You arrive there? Ok good. You done well so far then. Now you have a couple things to do. Let me tell you how. You must get rid of that 2 roamers first. I while stand my back on that corner, used innate camo. Some of those shrooms see through innate camo, so be carefull.<br />
When roamer comes single pull him when he is INFRONT of you at corner while passing by. Otherwise, you will agro whole platform . Kill it fast with nuke, keep DS , replenishment and nature recovery on. I didnt bother doting them, time is important here. Need burn fast asap. Ok, 2 roamer died now. That was easy part. Big problem is platform pull. You no need to worry  approximatelly25 more min about 2 roamers.  Med up fast and refresh buffs if needed. Make sure you stand back to corner so you dont get interrupt on spells, because mobs pushing you.<br />
<br />
Now all your self buffs ok, you are gtg. I couldnt first decide how to pull. To my bad luck there were 2 priests and king was up. Thats maybe worst possible thing you can encounter there because Priests can CH themselves or King or other priest. I decided to pull with savage root on priest so that i can at least have 1 king and 1 priest on my pull spot. But to my disappointed, savage root decided to resist and i pulled king and 2 priests . I couldnt decide who to nuke at first because i was keep nuking king and 2 priest were healing him. So i changed target and concentrated on just one priest he CHed once but with lucky crit blasts he died.  And then i thought about killing other priest so i can kill King alone much easy , however i decided quickly this was bad idea because King will run at low hp because he is extremely high MR, snare wont land, and he will exactly run to the hall on the left ahead and there are mobs will be waiting, i will be very low mana to handle all and all this long set up will be wasted. So i just nuked hard King , he has not much hp and other remaining priest didnt cheal him, because of Ds he was busy atm healing himself. Indeed King didnt run away at low hp because priest was there by him, and king died soon. Now only 1 priest left, it was easy to handle 1 he died very easy too.<br />
Too bad king didnt drop fungi tunic, he droped robe.<br />
<br />
Ok some things needs to be said: i was self buffed, i kept DS and replenishment and nature recovery all the time , i also used shaman DS potion too. I had no c3 or c5 because on first try (when i decided to clean zone out first, that enchanter frog dispelled my buffs). I almost died 3 times on second attempt because my heal got interrupted and at around 500 hp i had left i able to land heal on myself, then healed to full and let DS do job. I always casted nature infusion at my 70 percent life, because till you land your spell or cast, you are at 40-50 percent  life. Basically, 2 nuke, 1 heal, depends on situation really. I used Sotw too when i think i will really die this time especially 3 mobs hitting me  at the same time , each around 150 to 250 and i am at 40 percent life left heal keep getting interrupted, at that time i used sotw and healed myself to full. Also i used wrath of wild 3, that helped some too :) <br />
<br />
Do not try this if you get no channeling skill or alright equip to handle 3 mobs including King hitting you . You need to tank, no other option really. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Teres Shadowsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been thinking about camping king for sometime. Do you think that lvl 63 druid (epic) lvl 62 mage (epic) lvl 61 cleric (epic) and lvl 59 gimp warrior can handle this camp with no slow or crowd control? Me and my husband hydra so that could make it a bit harder as well. Also would the mage be easily able to invis to camp spot then summon the rest of group? We also dont know that area of seb that well P. But i have exudus so we would be willing to learn a time or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothar says:&lt;hr&gt;As far as i know, there is no way to split the King/PH and the 2 other Shrooms beside him on the platform with him by a Druid.[/quote]It's actually pretty easy to pull the king without his guards if you're level 60+, because the king's reaction radius is much bigger than an average myconid.  I have never tried to kill him solo as a druid, but I pulled him several times in Kunark at level 60.<br />
<br />
Approaching from the ilis jail side, kill the two myconids on the left.  Now as I recall there are either one or two roamers that walk by the king spot.  Wait until one of the roamers is close to the platform, within the king's reaction radius, but far enough so you don't aggro the other two, and pull, the king will drop down and come at you with the roamer.  If you're unlucky the myconids will path and bring another roamer or two, but at least you won't get the two myconids at the enterance (which you just killed).  If the frog roamer was a shaman, you might want to pull with dispel because the roamer might have haste on him.<br />
<br />
If the exit room doesn't have a priest/adept myconid up, you can kill near the enterance there in the hallway, since you've killed the frog roamer.  If you're lucky, the myconid roamer you pulled is also a low level warrior and you can root it outside of melee range, so it serves its purpose without hurting you.  Keep stuns up if it's a priest.<br />
<br />
Now, Hand of Ro and nuke the bejesus out of the king!  You want to nuke him down to 30-40% health as fast as possible, then he starts wasting time trying to heal himself and you're home free.  Keep your back to a wall so you get interrupted the least.<br />
<br />
This is how I did it many times in Kunark in small groups, and while pulls can easily go wrong, it is the easiest way to kill with minimum crowd control and the least worries about myconids CHing through walls.</div></div><hr />

Thats no longer possible Tudamorf, they changed it...</div></div><hr />

Granted it's been ages since I last went down there, but that's news to me.  Kind of a silly nerf.</div></div><hr />
