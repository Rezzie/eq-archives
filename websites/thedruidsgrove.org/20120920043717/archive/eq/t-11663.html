<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreleen</div><div class="date">07-04-2005, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all! Im hoping someone in my particular situation will be able to give me a little insight on what AAs I should be looking into in the immidiate future. Let me start off by saying that Im lvl 70 and I play main healer 95% of the time I group, period. If I ever solo anymore its due to boredom and lasts maybe two fights. So I hardly reguard myself as a kiter any more. Atm I have 248 AAs and like 8 unspent and very much stuck on where to go next. <br />
<br />
Heres a list of what I have so far:<br />
<br />
Run3<br />
Metab 3 (damn horse ^_^)<br />
Regen 1<br />
Gift of the Keepers<br />
<br />
Healing Adept 3<br />
Healing Gift 3<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
<br />
Mass Group Buff<br />
Exodus<br />
Dire Charm<br />
<br />
Planar Power<br />
<br />
Advanced Healing Adept 3<br />
Advanced Healing Gift 3<br />
Radiant Cure 3<br />
Spirit of the Wood 3<br />
<br />
Natures Boon 1<br />
<br />
Mnemonic Retention<br />
Expansive Mind 5<br />
Healing Adept Mastery 3<br />
Healing Gift Mastery 3<br />
Spirit of the Grove 3<br />
Call of the Wild<br />
Nature Bounty 2<br />
<br />
I think thats everything...so any suggestions for me? Im thinking chaotic potential for the exrta mana? Or maybe some defensive stuff so I can take a few cracks. I DONNO!<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated!:)</div></div><hr />

Innate Camouflage - my most used AA<br />
<br />
Innate Enlightenment - you mentioned Chaotic Potential for more mana, this should give you much more bang for the buck<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety - if you draw aggro quite a bit from healing this may be good<br />
<br />
Chaotic Potential - once wisdom gets this high the returns aren't too great<br />
<br />
Looks like you have your healing AAs out of the way and that's what you do in groups.  I would definately suggest innate camou if you haven't gotten, will free up a spell slot and it's instant invis anywhere.  Otherwise I would choose either defensive AAs or Crit/nuking AAs and max them out next.  If you raid a lot may want to get Respendent curing 3 and quickened curing 3, but if you don't raid radiant cure 3 should be plenty.</div></div><hr />

For me, thats fully buffed(Notice no SoE or Nettlecoat. I need the slots ) for dealing with Chromatic and Prismatic AE's( quite common starting with GoD expansion ). With 21 Buff slots, that only allows me 3 slots for AE Dots to land, Symphony of whateverthatbardcrapis(that they always hit mid fight and bufflocks me ) and MGB Heals. Often times with mobs that have multiple AEs, I am forced to trim off some more of those and run short on buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
From Dreleen's Magelo, I'd venture a guess she is progressing towards Qvic and her first taste of chromatic and prismatic AEs, and buff slots will soon be an issue.</div></div><hr />

I only use resists when I have to, I dislike having them up all the time, and I refuse to use DMF less it is vital to my living.  I dispise lev.  Not using then frees up 6 buff slots.  But you can easily hit 20 of 21 buffs on a raid without much trying.<br />

DoN is only 1 buff slot.... Mystical Attuning (maxed) is 5 buff slots, which is an OoW AA, not a DoN AA :P</div></div><hr />

Of course cleric and druid buffs are first cause I box a cleric with myself. And generally that's where I stop unless resists are needed, in which case it goes<br />
9 Seasons<br />
10 Druzzil<br />
11 Tribunal<br />
12 DMF<br />
13 Summer<br />
14 Mage DS(sometimes)<br />
15 Empty I guess<br />
<br />
It could be because I don't have any clickies, I gotta get to work on that, so it doesn't fill mine up anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jacob</div><div class="date">07-05-2005, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would highly recommend innate camo. I use that one nearly every time I log on. It is well worth it, in my opinion. <br />
Aside from that, it really depends on what you do and what you want to do. If you solo a lot, you may want to adjust your AAs to that. For instance:&lt;O:p&gt;&lt;/O:p&gt;<br />
 <br />
You mentioned you raid a lot, depending on what you're raiding and how you buff, Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery might be something to think about. If you are used as DPS in raids (guessing not by your attention to healing AAs) you could start pumping your fury line.&lt;O:p<br />
 <br />
If you solo a lot and use your DoTs, critical affliction could help.&lt;O:p<br />
 &lt;O:p<br />
 <br />
If you want versatility, max the mana regen. That extra 5 a tick is noticeable over time. And if you find yourself running out of buffs slots, go with that. But I would strongly suggest the innate camo.&lt;O:p&lt;/O:p</div></div><hr />

Nope. 21 Is max. They changed the window to allow 5 more but never came out with anything for the others, or at least we have yet to discover the rest.</div></div><hr />

And Ive prgressed quite a bit. I went ahead and bought Innate camo and Im very happy with it! It comes in super handy! Also finished off all lvls of innate enlightenment and currently have my 16th buff slot through mystical attuning. I will finish these off before I most to chaotic potential! I am very happy in my purchases so far! Thanks all who took the time to respond and help a lost cause druid like my self :wiggle:</div></div><hr />
