I tend to be the main patch healer (and curse healer once I find that rgc  :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
I only have 8 AA's atm (run3, regen3, scm1) and am looking to chart my aa path. Generally speaking it looks like I should finish out scm3, then get to MGB, SOTW, Radiant Cure then dire charm (in that order).<br />
<br />
Suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you solo a lot, the dmg aa's are worthwhile, as is innate cammo or exodus... or the root aa's; depending on your style.<br />
<br />
once grinding aa in full swing, you can never get enough of ha, hg, and ca/lr!<br />
<br />
the next thing you know you're dinging 200aa and wondering what's next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tough decision to make.  Especially since you're right at the beginning of starting your AAs.<br />
<br />
You gotta ask yourself what role you think you're going to have in raids, or what role you WANT to have.  Also, where do you think you'll be doing most of your raids.<br />
<br />
First off, without a doubt, get SCM3.  Less mana for spells means more mana in the long run. <br />
<br />
Now, if you're doing Luclin zones, then Radiant Cure would be beneficial, if not... you don't really need it.  Tier 1 and 2 PoP encounters have seldom use for it.<br />
<br />
If you plan on sticking to the healer role, then you may consider getting Healing Adept and/or Healing Gift maxed as well as their PoP AA equivalents.  Add to that SotW3 and you'd be set.<br />
<br />
If you think you might want to contribute to the DD effort, then by all means go with SCF3 and FoM3. Just go with what feels best for you. You may change your mind along the way a few times like we all have.<br />
<br />
Whatever you decide, two additional AAs that are a must are Exodus and Innate Camo.  These two alone will allow you to save your party (or yourself when you solo) more times than you can count and also allow you to do recon into zones, single-pull (if assigned to main puller) and travel just about everywhere with a bit more ease.<br />
<br />
If your WIS isn't as high as you'd like it, you might want to invest a few AAs into raising it, or help your mana regen with MC1&amp;2.  If you're over-maxed on WIS and want to benefit from it, you can go with Innate Enlightenment or Planar Power.<br />
<br />
There's really so many choices before you, it's hard to really plan out a definite path to take.<br />
<br />
One last piece of generally Druid-agreed upon advice, a few AAs that really are NOT worth the effort to obtain initially are:<br />
<br />
-MC3 (6AAs for 1 more point of mana/tic is a bit outrageous)<br />
-Enhanced Root<br />
-Viscid Roots<br />
-Improved Natural Durability<br />
-Quick Direct Damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenidina</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely finish out SCM, Innate Camo and Exodus are pretty much must have skills also.  If you can see yourself doing a lot of buffing possibly even MGB (for BOT9 or ever for SoTW).  Think you will be healing definitely go with regular and pop HA and HG, nuking more, SCF and Fury of magic.  You will also want to get Planar Power and Innate Enlightenment also to open up more of your wisdom if you are over 280 wisdom and not able to take advantage of all that excess.  If you farm for tradeskills a lot in newbie zones might even want to get Dire Charm down the road to help you with farming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grygonos Thunderwulf</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would reccomend finishing out SCM.  Getting MGB,SoTW3,RC3/SCR3,MC3.<br />
<br />
Your healing aa's are gonna be big time important if you are the main patch healer.  I would assume you're healing patch with NI, so then you have to decide whether to go HG or HA first (see other thread).<br />
<br />
The main thing you should keep in mind when choosing aa is what's gonna benefit your raid force the most.  That's why SCM is first, because it gives you, effectively, a bigger mana pool.  MGB and SoTW3 are REALLY awesome when used in conjuction.  SCR3 is a good skill for druids, and makes your SoTW last a smidge longer.  Depending on your preference I would get it or RC3 next.  RC3 is a great skill that can really help out in higher end encounters.  MC3, major duh, you regen mana faster... the more mana you have.  If you are gonna be max FT soon anyhow.. then I wouldn't worry about MC3.  Exodus and Innate Camo are great skills, but I don't see them impacting your raid force all that much... but I speak with the inexperience of not having these aa's first hand.  I don't know what the high end policy is on DC pets, but DC pets can add considerable DPS in certain encounters... so find out how your raidleaders feel about it and look at your upcoming DC pet options in higher end zones.. and plan accordingly as to whether or not you want to get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I speak w/ alot of inexperience not directly having these aa's but I feel like I understand what they do and their utility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SCM3 is a must.  I also recommend Mental Clarity 1, it's only 2 aa's for a little extra mana regen.  Innate camo and Exodus are fantastic aa's, but can be set aside for a while if you want to concentrate on raiding aa's.  After scm3 and mc1 (in whatever order), suggest like others that you aim for MGB and getting at least one level of SotW.  Additional levels of sotw are nice, but again, can be set aside for now since the difference is not huge.  After that, get yourself at least one level of Radiant Cure (same deal with the extra levels of it... nice, but not critical), and get going on some nuke crits or if you do more healing, get your healing aa's started (I prefer healing crits, some prefer the other one.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildaiena</div><div class="date">12-23-2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The raiding AAs for sure, but don't wait on innate camo, it is well worth it especially if you solo for exp (camo on the run). I waited until I had well over a 100 AA before I got it and I wish I would have gotten it a lot sooner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mdcythe</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 02:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finish SCM3.<br />
Work on your Healing Adept.<br />
Get MGB.<br />
Get Sotw1.<br />
Get RC1.<br />
Go back and finish all healing aa's.<br />
<br />
Those are the important ones, the rest is up to you. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">12-24-2003, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SCM3<br />
MC1<br />
SotW1<br />
MGB<br />
RC1<br />
<br />
Then, take your pick.  ND3 is good if you're getting aggro, or facing AE mobs.  HA/HG are good too.  MC2 and maybe even MC3 can help keep mana up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolaque</div><div class="date">12-25-2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should achieve a balance between raid AA's and your solo/group AA's.  So, this is what I recommend, with reasons why. <br />
<br />
SCM3 - mana savings<br />
MGB, sotw1 - contributes to raid heals, you can get sotw3 later (there are other things more useful than sotw2,3)<br />
radiant cure1 - removes many afflictions for groups, get RC2 RC3 much later, 100+aa's<br />
Those are the must haves.   Now for some others:<br />
 <br />
innate cameo - invaluable AA, you'll be amazed with this ability and wonder why you waited so long to get it.<br />
exodus - good for groups, ldon, solo exploring. <br />
Healing AA's - Healing adept3, Healing gift3 (then do the Advanced levels).  You have to decide how important healing is to your raid contribution.  But realilze that druid blast heals in a raid are often on the rampage tank, or on assist heals.  I would do the Adept AA's first (more healing for the same mana), then Gift AA's (critical heals). <br />
Spell Casting Fury - lots of satisfaction here, being able to cast crits.  <br />
Innate Enlightenment, planar progression - put AA's into these abilities as your wisdom rises with better gear. <br />
<br />
Pure Blood - while this is a spell, you should do the quest for this spell.  Very handy of the course of your raiding life. <br />
RGC - Very useful in some raids, but can be difficult to obtain. <br />

<br />
 Personally I didnt need innate camo, held off until I got into the 90s or so in AAs, but I do like it so it's up to you. I wouldn't bother with the healing AAs that DONT work with our CHs for a while, I can think of better things to buy before them.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the love of all thats good, if you dont have Pureblood yet, GET IT. I swear other than ensnare this is like *THE* most useful spell in my spell book. RGC is nice if you are doing mobs that curse, just do Takish adventures till you can buy it since you can no longer farm PoM for it (thank god I did that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
SCM first before all.<br />
<br />
If your guild needs more MGB heals, get spirit of wood 1, then MGB<br />
then SotW2, 3.<br />
<br />
If your guild needs heavy spotting or off tanking healing from you.<br />
Get Healing Adept, AHA<br />
<br />
If your having trouble surving AEs or getting low HP agro.  Get ND1-3<br />
<br />
If your looking for DPS, get Nuke Crits &amp; Fury of Magic<br />
<br />
if your looking for Group related abilities: get innate camo, and exodus.  Both of these are basically worthless on a raid but very nice for grouping.<br />
<br />
if your having trouble with Mana Pool, get some combo of MC, IE, PP<br />
<br />
I'd likely lay off Dire Charm until you have lots of the above<br />
unless you have acess to POE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maedie</div><div class="date">12-31-2003, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">skip dire charm as a &quot;raiding aa&quot; unless your new guild has an active policy of having druids DC during raids. most of the time its chanters that are  asked to charm higher level (and heavier hitting) mobs (level 55-63 mobs or so)&lt; with druids assisting them by snaring the mobs and healing the chanter; For most raids, there are rarely any DC animals handy to charm anyways; It's an awfully expensive AA to spend on when used so rarely.<br />
<br />
I've found Innate Camo to be highly useful in getting to a raid zone safely and quickly. It's a 20 minute long camo that can be cast on the run, doesn't take a spell slot, and doesn't mysteriously &quot;drop&quot; like most of our other camoflage spells. My guild is VT/pre-elemental, and i'm often called upon to port guildmembers to dawnshroud/twilight/etc.  With the mess of coordinating rides, FoEagles buffing, invising the group, and finally casting the circle spell involved in getting your group mates to these zones, (casting the port spell, of course, cancels your own invis =P  ) it's very nice to just cast the insta-camo on yourself and run once you get to DSP/whereever.  Same goes for getting through plane of valor, hall of honor for the various trials, getting to Temple of Mith Marr, etc. It's enormously helpful for getting to a raid on time without training the raid or the zone. =)<br />
<br />
If you are joining a guild which is VT/Emp/pop level, and you have a  good chance of winning loot at those raids, then don't bother putting points in Wisdom, you'll be maxxed soon enough. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like you said, Mass Group Buff, then Spirit of the Wood (1,2,3), then Radiant Cure (1,2,3 if you want), then Extended Buffs AA for your Bot9/SotW AA's compliment.<br />
<br />
Dire Charm will NEVER help you in Raids at the Luclin and above level IMHO.  <br />
<br />
Innate Camo, Spell Casting Fury, Fury of Magic, Exodus, are all dandy and have some use to you and the raiding guild in one small fashion or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anka</div><div class="date">01-13-2004, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never missed dire charm and I'm nearing 300 AA now. Many raid leaders only allow pets if their masters have pet hold AAs and other abilities. Since we don't have those abilities our pets could be liabilities even in the very few zones where you could get the dire charmed pet to the encounter.<br />
<br />
I'd also comment that in any raid encounter a druid will usually heal as necessary and debuff, then put spare mana into damage later. This suggests to me that healing is our priority raid role and AAs should be spent on healing adept and gift for a purely raiding druid. There aren't many purely raiding druids though ;).</div></div><hr />

I can think of at least the caprin cycle where druid DC pets are both useful DPS AND cute!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuolon</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Every PoE/PoA ring raid that we do Druids and Enchanters have DC pets.  They're nice DPS and provide nice push for cornering mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Callahad</div><div class="date">01-14-2004, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Scm1, MC1, scm2, scm3 first and foremost.<br />
<br />
Then it depends on your soloing method. If you are charming, I suggest Innate Camo, then SCF1-2-3. Quad kiting, I would skip innate camo and jump straight to SCF1-2-3. Root-dotting and grouping I would go straight to more raid-friendly AAs.<br />
<br />
Next is raid-oriented AAs. Pick up sotw1, rc1, then MGB. Then MC 2-3. Your guild will likely want you to have that combo sooner than later. Then it depends. Likely, you will be put in a spot-healer role, and be asked to nuke as needed. The important job though is spot-healing, the rest is just icing on the cake. So I would suggest Healing gift and healing adept be maxxed. Then FoM 1-2-3.<br />
<br />
If at any point you find difficulties surviving, get ND1-2-3 somewhere in there. <br />
<br />
Finally, to finish it off, CA3/CS3/ID5/LR5. After this it really doesnt matter much eh. 'course you likely by then have 250 AAs ;)<br />
