&quot;Grinding in world of warcraft is pretty easy. There are many times where I would push my attack button and walk away to get a drink or make a snack and come back to find a dead mob and repeat the process.&quot;<br />
<br />
This quote made a ton of people mad and I am being accused of never playing the game.<br />
<br />
Hasn't anyone else done other things like clean their room, watch tv, alt-tab to aim, etc. while grinding in warcraft? Could an avid gamer really say grinding equal level or lower mobs in world of warcraft is hard?</div></div><hr />

I think a lot depends on the class, too... key-intensive classes like rogues or warriors, if you don't use your abilities, the fights get much harder.<br />

On my druid I did this all the time:elfbiggri <br />
<br />
Start a fight and go microwave some nachos.  Come back in about 15 seconds later and hit Frenzies Regen.  Go grab my bowl and a drink.  Shift out heal, shift back.  Turn on a movie.  <br />
<br />
Grinding was so easy (even pre 1.8, I can't imagine how rediculously easy it'd be now).  I think that's part of the problem though.  May be why so many people make it to 60 and don't really know anything.</div></div><hr />

i find it more fun to grind with my mage that i just started since it only takes 4-5 spells and they're dead, and you always have to move to kite them</div></div><hr />

You haven't lived til you AOE grind.  It helps if you spec ice with that talent that slows mobs down when you blizzard them.  <br />
Frost Nova--&gt;&gt;Blizzard--&gt;&gt;Blizzard---&gt;&gt;keep on going til they are dead.  <br />
<br />
You can sorta afk grind on a lock.  Send in the Blueberry and DOT them up.  Watch T.V. and every-so-often hit the dots again.</div></div><hr />

When you would log in you'd find yourself in a GM-made dungeon for anywhere from 3 - 21 days (sometimes indefinite if banned for the same offense more than once). <br />
<br />
I guess we can all be thankful Blizz hasn't resorted to that hehe</div></div><hr />

They hand out bans for playing unattended all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am saying you hit attack on a mob and walk away for 30 seconds to a minute while you go and do something else like get a drink or alt-tab to respond to an aim message.<br />
<br />
If you played unattended for long periods of time, I would hope you would get banned.</div></div><hr />
