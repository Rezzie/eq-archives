<br />
I'm looking for some WWS reports (or others) from raiding feral DPSers.  We're back to having a surplus of tanks lately so I feel like I'm going to be DPSing for a bit and wanted to see what sort of numbers I should be aiming for.  <br />
<br />
I haven't yet had a chance to try on Patchwerk alas so I don't have a ground number to start from. =(  <br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I think this was right after 3.1???  The 2nd night I was tanking rather than DPS.<br />

My gear certainly isn't 10-man BiS, but I'm fairly close (might be missing 4-5 pieces).  I don't have a single 25-man item.  I often run with 2 pallies so I get kings and might.<br />
<br />
Check our Anub failure, I was wearing my tanking gear (and maybe tanking spec).  I fixed that after I noticed how much I was missing everything.  I went from 2K in bear gear bear spec to 3.4K in Cat gear cat spec.</div></div><hr />

Two questions, I noticed you're gemmed with armor penetration.  Do you find that ups your DPS quite a lot with the change?  I was leaning back towards the agi-crit thing with rip crits nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I had everything gem'd agi (because I share most of it with bear), but the few pieces that are cat only I gem ArmPen.  Is that the right choice?  I'm not 100% sure.  Right now ArmPen seems to be worth as much as Agi if not a bit more.  But, then, some folks think Agi is worth more.<br />
<br />
ArmPen gives provides more damage boost to white and shred, where as Agi helps with Rip and CP generation.  But it can also make for odd rotations because of the RNG factor associated with crit.</div></div><hr />
