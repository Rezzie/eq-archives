We both play on the same server, and I'm always picking on him because he can get all the nice camps.  I have a level 58 druid and I've noticed something:<br />
<br />
It seems like there are no good item camps for us!  While my friend is in Veksar soloing a camp for a 20k belt (which he usually gets in 2 or 3 hours and sells), I'm stuck farming acrylia ores or killing massive numbers of gobbies in SolA.  Even the PoN stalkers camp, while nice, is just a chump change camp.<br />
<br />
Are there any nice camps that a druid can solo :confused:?  I don't inquire about vendor fodder camps or tradeskill farming, either.  I'm asking about nice loot camps, for things like that Belt.  Things worth listing in the bazaar that can make you a nice chunk of money overnight.</div></div><hr />

Chardok is soloable at your level, as is the Grey.  Both have items in the 500-2k range and beyond, which really isn't bad for a 58 druid.</div></div><hr />

in 3 hours you can pbae yourself thousands of plat worth of acrylia....<br />
<br />
get 2 friends to open an ldon adv for you and spend your 2 hours at the zone in foraging... say goblin bones, a stack will sell for a couple kpp.<br />

sure, it's no 20kpp item, but money's money.<br />

Also you can solo in tactics at 64 once you can charm boars alot of tradeskill items there and just regular cash items.<br />

Can solo at butload of otherplaces too but cant recall any of them having good cash drops.<br />

huh soloing Trak that banishes ppl to shrooms has some nasty AEs and doesnt mele too bad either. Not to mention it would be very hard to impossible to fight him single. I dont think so. He would be chalenging to one group unless you have really high resists couple of tanks and a mage in a group.</div></div><hr />

But I had to stop because on Veeshan here the prices for acrylia got really low in the last few months.  In fact, acrylia ore is worth about &lt;i&gt;half&lt;/i&gt; as much now as it was when I was farming it.  At least, here on Veeshan.<br />

I have been farming Acrylia for a few weeks now, but lately sales of ore has slowed down a lot.  I used to be able to sell 3-4k worth a week, but lately I am lucky to sell 1k a week.  Plus the amount of ore available in the bazaar has gone up a lot too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I haven't tried Trak yet.  As for the banishing ... If you're soloing him, he will summon you back after he banishes you.  In a group, if you EVER get banished by Trak, all you need do is sit down and he'll summon you back.<br />
<br />
If you're in melee range, you can land Hand of Ro and Illumnation on him.  That should cut his dps some.  If you can pull him to a corner, you should be able to channel heals/nukes.  Can get a 120 DS going without shaman potions so porcupining him may be viable with a few potions.  Maybe a couple backpacks worth of insta-heal potions as well.  And that AE isn't as nasty at 65 with Time level gear as it was at 60 with Kunark level gear.<br />
<br />
And if things don't go according to plan ... We do have a get-out-of-jail-free card ;)<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Gornaire is soloable these days (spoiler: non-damage kite her until she nukes her manabar away then pull her to a nice corner to DS tank her).  Kunark dragons aren't easy to solo (you stand a very good chance of losing even with Time gear), but it is possible.</div></div><hr />

Instead of fighting and completing the adventure, just forage forage forage for things like those goblin bones, which are worth a lot of money.<br />
<br />
The zone where you forage goblin bones... I think thats the LDON dungeon in South Ro - - Rujarkian ???  That might not be the only one though.<br />

I think it's a great idea.  It would work even better if those friends could forage too and get more bones =)</div></div><hr />

Four simple examples:  spider silk, leather padding, iron oxide and mercury.  The former 2 can be farmed in many zones, the later 2 drop like candy in the revamped Hole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the meantime I've gotten back into the acrylia market, I just farm or buy ore off of people and make studs.  I seem to be selling them very well at 150p each, which is a nice profit.  As long as you're willing to sit at the forge and bite the bullet for a few failed combines, it's worth it.<br />
<br />
Gonna try Loddy later today though.  If not for myself, to sell the shield =P<br />

Other things like the Soulstripper, FT1 necklace dropped in Tor, Viel of the Warlord, and other things from throughout that expansion(and the cash is usually good from the mobs with gem drops).  <br />
<br />
One thing I am wondering is, where is a good place to farm acrylia? I am trying to up fletching and the one real problem is the acrylia ore for the shafts. I have been going to Acrylia Caverns but its slow with having to root DoT the mobs since its indoor, and there is nothing to my knowledge to charm.  Any info on good places for Acrylia ore would be very appriciated:).</div></div><hr />

There are two Grimling caves along the southwest wall, and they have Acrylia ore that drops.  However, that's not where I got my best fills =)<br />
<br />
---( The grimlings are around level 34.  the grimling geomancers cast DD spells and the gatherers cast a weak root -has yet to stick on me- and ore is not all that common.  Grimling Laborer pops at one of the two camps every 10 mins or so and always drops pieces or a brick or two. )---<br />
<br />
Try the wandering Grol Baku Soldiers in TM, the same zone.  I found that at least one in every 4 kills drops some ore, and Ive had them drop up to three bricks at a time on MANY occasions.  a KEI (read 2-3 hours) could usually fill 2 tenslotters or more with bricks.<br />
<br />
---( Grol Baku soldiers do try to root you.  Ive had it stick on me plenty of times, but after I hit 51-52 I started just PWNZing them 3-4 at a time.  they hit in thr 60-80 range usually if you let them get close enough for melee.  other aliens will aggro to help them so be careful, though none of the aliens are really above level 44-46 or so. )---<br />

Sold it for 13k in about 5 minutes through EQSN channel.  How?<br />
<br />
Easy.  I wanted to gain 3 AAXP.  So I teamed up with a friend of mine who happens to be a 65 Necro.  in HoH, at SE (top floor), we kept clearing the floor with just the two of us, so I'd harmony pull the Wrulon's at the front door.  About 2 hours in, one of the Wrulon Guards dropped this sword.  It was too easy.  Necro buddy fear kites, I dump 5 different DoT's on the fluffy bastage.  I even sick bear pet on him :p <br />
<br />
I know the original intent of my starting this thread was for SOLO camps... But I have to admit, Duoing is much better.  Even with the Druids arch nemesis, the Necromancer, I have to admit that if you know a good one, they're the best duo partner around for us =)  Just so many more opportunities.<br />
<br />
However, I think this thing could be solo'd just as easy =)  Get to a camp with Wrulon guards in HoH.  Get in a safe spot, and start harmonizing everything along the path that you'll pull the critter.  Make sure to Harmony his two buddies at the door too.  Only the guards drop the sword.  Just DoT kite it in the wide part of the hall right above the stairs down to the next level =)  I tried it on three Wrulons and the technique worked fine.  Getting this sword solo in HoH should be easy =)<br />

Last time I tried loddy with a mage friend, we got him to 90% and then a Beastlord and a Druid (with DC'd turtle) KS'd us.  /cries &quot;Betrayed by my own kin!!!  Ah, no, he wasn't a Druid... Must have been a Dr00d.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tactics is a great idea, hehehe.  Makes me want to camp the Daiku all by myself to get the medal parts.  I don't know if my guild has tried Behemoth for flag yet.<br />
<br />
I just thought of something.  It's not nice, but its a great $ maker.  Get the 4 pieces for the tactics flag.  Okay, good for you, you can flag a group for tactics now! /ooc WTS Plane of Tactics flags!  5 openings... GT with offers.<br />
It's not nice, but it works :)  Just make sure anyone who helped you get the medals gets it free! hehe...</div></div><hr />

Must be EP+ geared to survive probably ;)<br />
<br />
I have LR5 wich also helps tanking him.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are buffed with Pot9 and DS etc. (self buffs are sufficent).<br />
<br />
Snare &gt; Root &gt; DoT.<br />
When summoned it will take damage from the DS. Then you just stack dots on him, and everytime he summons you, you run away and heal yourself if you are getting too low. Then you will get re-summoned.<br />
<br />
I stacked dots on him while tanking him, but to be sure heals wasn't interupted I ran a bit away and healed before he could resummon.<br />
<br />
It took almost all of my 6k+ mana bar though, had to spend way too much mana on healing myself :p<br />
<br />
I gotta remember that pet trick, would surely make it ten times easier with the added DPS. (allthough I have never bothered getting DC).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can fix faction extremely easily soloing Lt's at the bank in Kael.  Lt/Dk blue at 65 easy root dot and chance of armor drops that still sell ok for mq's.</div></div><hr />

Takes about 90mins self buffed as I tend to kill a couple of wanderers as well when they get in the way.<br />
<br />
Drops range from rare velious spells, assorted lvl 60 spells, dragonskin armour, heads (which im kos so cant quest in but would be nice extra cash if i could) and talismans (the ac7 6 to all stats 30hp/mana ones). I tend to just /ooc the talisman rather than have them rot but I guess I could always sell the looting rights if I was feeling particularly nasty.<br />
<br />
A typical clearing results in ~10-15k worth of drops. Nothing amazing but its reliable as I always get something... plus they are always up and its a lot of fun. Last run was best yet with a peerless bracer, couple assorted other 2k armour bits, 3 aegolisms and about 8 other spells that sell for 500-1500pp.<br />
<br />
Not a camp that probably many can do yet ... but with new expansion it will get easier again :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm...  Could I Dire Charm it instead, or is it too strong?  If so, that's a much better option =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, bloodtusks are too high to dire charm, around 50ish or so.<br />
<br />
My only wish is that some of those pigs would run away and hide in the Torgiran Mines for me to find and &quot;befriend.&quot; :)<br />

I enjoy nothing more than having a hasted (face mask and buff), dual-wielding stun-proccing weapons, fully-buffed boar breaking charm on you!........ just after snare has worn off :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I was in Nadox just the other day walking around with a buffed/mage-equipped &quot;exhausted Bloodtusk&quot; as a pet. Now there's a nice little farming machine, able to tank several mobs at the same time when I got some unexpected adds. However, I couldn't get over the feeling that I was escorting my own personal executioner around with me.  :) Charm breaking in tight quarters will definitely test your skills as a druid.<br />

Test my skills? Last time it happened to me, I didn' have time to react! The only thing i saw after that pet window disappeared was 'loading, please wait' :p</div></div><hr />

You sir, have balls made out of pure STONE.  LOL<br />

I've heard of this being done, but never have I seen it.  THAT would be one hell of a memorable sight.</div></div><hr />

Theres a named there that drops a nice ER3 melee/hybrid necklace that used to sell for around 15k when I did this. Sorry I cant be more specific but its been a while since ive played my druid. It used to spawn fairly frequently to I was never there for more than 3 hours and I got one most of the times I went. Was also great fun exploring and getting there :)</div></div><hr />

It was a very close fight, although we were both in pre-VT gear (pre-NToV even?) at the time.<br />
<br />
He dropped a neat ring with +9 to all resists, which I still swap in on occasion to this day. :)</div></div><hr />

Soloing Spiritseeker though...  Not saying that anyone can't do it, but if you can, gimme a screenshot, har!  I wanna see too!  hehe.</div></div><hr />

Ive tried several times with my charmed pet proccing slow on nadox.<br />
He damages pet so fast you barely have time to cast nukes/dots on nadox himself.<br />
Have to spend too much time healing pet.<br />
Duoed nadox easiliy with an enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">02-03-2004, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a possible alternative...suppose you charmed an exhausted bloodtusk, equipped it with the di'zok oracle shillelagh and maybe an onyx gavel, and then tanked nadox for the fight with the bloodtusk attacking from behind, hoping charm won't break?  It's the only way I can see doing this solo, and I imagine it would require some impressive gear.<br />
<br />
I'd try it but I have a ways to go on the gear.  So far I think a skyfire guardian wurm and an armadillo in plane of earth are the toughest things I've managed. :P<br />
<br />
On a side note, I wonder if the bloodtusk would equip gear that lowers magic resistance, like a silver jacinth ring.../ponder<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read in another thread that it can be done using a pet tank, and without slow even.  I never would have expected that...</div></div><hr />

Even if pet procced a slow (mitigated at that) you'd be a bit hard-pressed to chain NI to stay alive.  I could be wrong, but I'd guess it would have to be a charm solo.<br />
<br />
I've come very close with my 2-box Enchanter, but quite honestly his loot is not that great if you are big enough to take him out with 2 toons, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Where have you been camping for loot, even if it's not a camp.  killing anything in particular?  books for the tunic?  medals for tactics flags?  duoing with a friend somewhere?<br />
<br />
Better yet, has anyone found anything nifty and doable in GOD yet? =)<br />
<br />
I'm on tradeskilling stuff lately, unless I can get a group together for BoT.  BoT groupage means good drops...  Unfortunately, my HoH duo friend is too busy lately to play =\</div></div><hr />
