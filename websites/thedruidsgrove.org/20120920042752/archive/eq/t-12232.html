<br />
There was no need to detect traps.  Just cast disarm and if there was a trap it would be disarmed, if there wasn't, you would get a message, &quot;No trap to disarm&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also am not sure if you need a spell to open the chest.<br />
<br />
Since I have never bothered with any chest other than the ones that drop once you kill a mob (which are never trapped and are opened with /open or destroyed to loot), could someone with experience with possibly trapped / cursed chests explain how you go about this?<br />
<br />
Are cursed chests something that I should learn to deal with even if I never do another LDoN again?<br />
<br />
P.S.  Note to Sony, remove the requirement to carry expendable items to use these spells.  It is just annoying and wastes bag space.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I believe you have to sense first in order to disarm, and you do need the lock spell to unlock them, at least that has been my experiance in this trial.<br />

I'll go to LDoN and buy the spells I'm missing now.<br />
<br />
Along with waste some bag space carrying crappy expendable items (Boo, Sony).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aldier</div><div class="date">09-28-2005, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trial of Subversion requires you to successfully sense the trap, can sometimes take more than 1 cast if the RNG fails you or you are too far away.  After sensing the trap, you have to disarm the trap.  After you disarm the trap, you have to use the 3rd spell to unlock the chest.  Then, you can /open the chest like normal and loot it.<br />
 <br />
If any step in that process fails, you should repeat it until you get a success.  And yes, remember to bring some greater scryer stones with you.</div></div><hr />

I'll don't want to spoil anything so i'll let you figure out which one needs to be decursed :)</div></div><hr />
