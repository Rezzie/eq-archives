<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Autumn10</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there anthing that can be soloed in this zone? I just got access and was wondering if there were any hunting grounds for soloing in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Noliniel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm if you good yea =p Mobs immune to run speed but doesn't summon. ones near zone in anyways. they do however come in pairs and sol ro is an indoor zone ( no soe, harmony etc.. ) Mobs hits 600ish to 800ish and stun a ton. There is no zone out =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Za Arain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can kite around the cross thing in the center of the room at the zone in.  It's a bit tricky but doable.  Not worth the effort IMHO if you're just looking for exp.<br />
<br />
Note that if you're local GM has a hangover or is otherwise feeling pissy they might put a warning on your account for exploiting pathing (the pathing around the cross is not the best).  One of the people in my guild got a 3-day ban for exploiting pathing and then daring to question the GM about what exactly constitutes path exploitation.<br />
<br />
Yes, zone in mobs do drop ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Autumn10</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I guess I'll just group in Sol Ro and wait for PoFire to solo then. Thanks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jocund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So far I have gotten 6 ornate drops soloing in Sol Ro.  Cast SoE before you zone in and gate out periodicly to refresh.<br />
<br />
You will need an extended range item (player made ceramic sword is what I use).  Use the post so that you fly over the stairs while the mob goes around the long way (I don't think that is an exploit - I have lev and the mob does not).  I nuke them down with Winter's Frost and I use E'ci to debuff.  Forget Fire nukes.<br />
<br />
It is close with a 6.3 cast time and I usually nuke at every other hop.  I am working on getting Quick Damage to reduce my casting time.<br />
<br />
It is true that you get double pulls all the time and then there are the two wanderers.  I have Quick Evac so my Egress takes 2.5 seconds and that is how I loose aggro, loot, and med.  I have not tried it but since you can cast a 6.3 nuke w/o getting hit, you should have no problem with a 5 second egress.<br />
<br />
If I don't get trained, and I keep my eyes open for the wandering sentries, I generaly don't get hit at all.<br />
<br />
Ornate drop rate is about 1 every 2 or 3 hours solo with KEI.<br />
<br />
Edit: PS Duo is great - you each take one of the two mobs on each pull and basicely solo your mob same as above.</div></div><hr />
