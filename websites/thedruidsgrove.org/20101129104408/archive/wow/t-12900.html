Anyone else have thoughts on it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Abies I will probably go for a combination of tanking and Feral PvP. A PvP build will still do decent cat DPS, and my role in raids will be the one of main tank anyways.<br />
Nocturna will be some combination of full Resto and a Balance build - maybe a Balance/Resto hybrid. I don't PvP much with her (don't like caster PvP), which means I can focus on PvE builds.</div></div><hr />

That way I can heal, tank or DPS 5/10-mans.  We always seem to end up short healers...</div></div><hr />

My goal is to decrease my amount of gear needed by 60%.  My bank will be mine again!!!! Or I'll make a guild just to store my crap... either way... I win!!!!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I actually did this in a roundabout way.  I was leveling an alt and got invited to some random guild, and then the guild leader proceeded to make me GM and then /gquit.  So out of the clear blue I was the owner of a guild with about 15 other lvl 10s - 20s in it (that hadn't been online forever).  I proceeded to gkick them, invite my and my RL friends low level alts and we all use it to store enchanting mats / leather / herb / ore / gems consumables etc.  <br />

Re: my Druid, I'll most likely go with a Feral Cat DPS / Resto dual spec.  I believe that I'll be able to tank the 5 mans up to 80 without a 'pure bear' build, and that will allow me some versatility and speed for grinding / questing, and still heal effectivley if necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, I do have a decent Feral off-set, I have to admit, I enjoy being a caster.<br />
<br />
No offense to my fellow kitties.</div></div><hr />

So thus I created my second druid.  Now I have a Boomkin/Healer and a Tank/melee.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-15-2008, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Genesis for PvE and NP for PvP I think.  Though if you take living seed, the extra 3% crit helps.  But I think Genesis still, cause a large majority of my healing is coming from HoT's, and an extra 5% to that seems to be a much bigger overall boost to healing than 3% crit.<br />
 <br />
If you are going to be PvP'ing, I'd take NP - any damage reduction is bigtime, especially with everyone speccing into their new loldps 51pt talents.</div></div><hr />

Got another one for ya:  Replenish.<br />

I'm kind of thinking I'd rather put the 3 points into my balance tree - the better to fight with, my dear.  :smile5:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valhun</div><div class="date">10-31-2008, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought the same thing doing Feral Tank/Feral DPS.<br />
<br />
But looks like my 10 man needs be more as Resto then Feral, like I use to be.<br />
<br />
So I will most likely be Resto / Feral Tank.<br />
<br />
What is nice about this is that I can fill either roll, which seems like its always a healer or tank that is missing for a group or raid.  But with the new Duel Spec, this would most likely change.</div></div><hr />

We don't have an ETA. We would love to get it in for 3.1 but if I said it will be in 3.1 and it isn't, then players get mad. It's easier if we just say &quot;soon.&quot; <br />
