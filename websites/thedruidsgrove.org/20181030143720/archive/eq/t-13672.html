These are decent augments with from 40-40 Hp/Mana to 65-70 plus various stat improvements, DS, Regen, etc.<br />
<br />
What little I've been able to find out is that they've been looted off various level 70-73 trash mobs. But few details. <br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is if anyone has some experience to share with seeking these augments. How often do they drop? Are there really patterns with which mobs drop them or are these just rare (how rare?!) zone-wide drops off trash.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any info on these?</div></div><hr />

If you're level 70 and hit track and it cons red, but starts with &quot;a something-or-another&quot;, that's what I mean. There are some other red-cons in zone too, but they all have capitalized names (Arena Overseer, Ashenback, Nightshade, etc..).<br />
 <br />
So, when you find something like &quot;a demented scrykin&quot; in tracklist and it cons red, that's what you're looking for. They drop augs and occasionally grey orbs (for black orb of scrykin quest). I guess they all have placeholders and so on, but I haven't spent eneough time there to know. There's at least one on the upper level too. Probably at least one per &quot;theme&quot; - fire / ice / storm.<br />
 <br />
If you go farm these, would you care posting your information back here? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't tried one of these yet, cuz frankly, some of the trash in this zone are gross UNDERcons and so far with what little I've seen drop they're not worth the effort. I mean, mobs like white-conning &quot;a lost scrykin servant&quot;s are fully MR and hit like tanks, including flurrying and cast aoe nukes and dots. That's why I've wanted to get some more info beforehand. <br />
<br />
I will try to post results, as they happen. Appreciate if others do the same!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The PH is soloable with ease, but the named summons quickly, and hits hard and fast.  Doable by me, a shammy who I was boxing of about the same gear/aa, and an SK I drafted in to help.  The SK won the roll on the aug... to be fair, it's a great tank aug... but after all my effort i was gutted.<br />
<br />
The demented scrykin I have killed and can confirm he's about the same difficulty as &quot;a lost spirit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Have also seen redcon &quot;deceitful scrykin&quot; on track, but not killed.</div></div><hr />
