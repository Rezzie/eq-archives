<br />
My husband's birthday is coming up in a few weeks... I'd like to get him a new console but not sure which one he'd like most.  He absolutely LOVED his dreamcast, so I'm not sure which of Gamecube, Xbox or Playstation II would appeal to him the most?<br />
<br />
He likes the fighting games the most, like Marvel Vs Capcom etc...   But he also really liked games like Crazy Taxi, or adventure games like Tomb Raider... <br />
<br />
I also don't care about DVD capabilities etc, I own a seperate DVD player so it's not important to me.  Just want fun games for him.  <br />
<br />
So I guess, which is most like Dreamcast?   I've looked at the games for each console and they all seem to have some fun games...   Gamecube's Super Smash Bros. Melee sounds the most fun, but eh, what do I know =)<br />

<br />
It also has its fair share of adventure games (eg. final fantasy series) and is compatible with PS1 stuff (therefore tombraider).<br />
<br />
Dunno about the others :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kenz</div><div class="date">11-05-2002, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is your husband still playing his DC and which games are being played?<br />
<br />
If those games have sequels, i.e. DoA2 -&gt; DoA3, Jet Set Radio -&gt; Jet Set Radio Future, Soul Calibur -&gt; Soul Calibur 2 etc. It probably would be good to buy him the console with the sequels. <br />
<br />
Gamecube games are roughly aimed towards the younger children's market while the PS2 and Xbox games are aimed at a slightly older market of teenagers and young/mature adults.<br />
<br />
The Xbox used to have the monopoly on old Sega games, but most companies these days including Sega are releasing their games across most consoles. <br />
<br />
I was tossing up between getting an Xbox or PS2 and ended up getting PS2 because of a MetalGearSolid2 + PS2 deal. I still play my DC now and again, but it's mostly replaying Shenmue1&amp;2 which #2 is also available on the Xbox. I would now only buy an Xbox if Shenmue3 came out on it and not on anything else.<br />
<br />
Check out these links to see if the PS2 or Xbox has the sequels to the games your husband likes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broomhilda</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just went throug this dilemma about a month ago.  I ended up getting the PS2 with no regrets so far.  I asked all kinds of people, and PS2 seemed to be what everyone reccomended mainly because of the amount of games available, which is probably the most important aspect of buying a console.  I had Dreamcast, graphics were good, but what sucked was there werent that many games made for it, and it died out fast.  I'm not completely sure, but i also think PS2 comes with the built in DVD player, whereas you have to buy the add-ons for the other consoles to play DVD's.  <br />
<br />
I dont play it all that much, only have NBA2k3, NFL2k3, and GTA3.  Mainly just play the 2 sports games, was less than impressed with GTA, but i was expecting alot out of it from all the hype.  <br />
<br />
So i'd reccomend PS2, just because you know there are tons of games available, and many more on the way.  Which also means it will probably have the longest life span out of the ones currently on the market.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fernwick</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing someone should point out is that PS2 graphics &lt; GC graphics &lt; XBox graphics (in other words, PS2 has the worst graphics of the next generation consoles). Also, the GameCube costs a good $50 less than either a PS2 or XBox (okay, you get a half-rate DVD player with a PS2 or XBox that you need an additional controller for on the PS2, but you could buy a better DVD player for the price difference). What all of this means is that the GameCube is both the bargain buy and technically superior to the PS2.<br />
<br />
Now, I realize that buying a GameCube means you wouldn't be able to shoot hookers like you can in some of those great &quot;adult&quot; PS2 games that are out there, but the GameCube does have some decent titles also (more than the XBox does), and should be considered as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the generic breakdown:<br />
Gamecube:  &quot;Family&quot; targeted<br />
XBox:  &quot;Mature&quot; targeted<br />
PS2:  &quot;Everyone and their dog gets a license to publish games&quot;<br />
<br />
The XBox has the current &quot;I'm better than you&quot; rank for graphics, none of the other machines can come close to the awesome potential of the XBox's graphic engine.  Expect this to change in about 2 years as the next-next gen consoles hit the market.  Just don't expect your console to be a lasting thing, most have a &quot;shelf-life&quot; of about 4 years before you have to upgrade, much like computers.<br />
<br />
The PS2 is the all out champion when it comes to number of titles and diversity of titles.  Sony is very lax on their requirements on dev companies, their licensing fees are small and that encourages software companies to make games for them because they get to keep a larger chunk of the cash.  However, their graphics are getting pretty dated.  When you compared a &quot;PS2-port-to-XBox&quot; game on the XBox, you could always tell the graphics were dumbed down for the PS2.<br />
<br />
The Gamecube seems to have won the &quot;I have young kids&quot; slot.  My friends who have all three consoles tell me that the Gamecube has the prettiest &quot;just for fun&quot; based games.  You won't find much blood on this console, Nintendo has taken the path straight to winning the family market, and they're doing it with great multi-player games which don't require a large time investment.  In other words, you can pop in games and play just to play, rather than spending hours on back-story.<br />
<br />
Here's a generic genre breakdown (from best to worst):<br />
Fighting Games:  PS2/XBox/Gamecube<br />
Sports Games:  PS2-XBox(tie)/Gamecube<br />
Family Games:  Gamecube/PS2/XBox<br />
RPGs: PS2, both Gamecube and XBox far behind<br />
Simulators:  XBox/PS2/Gamecube<br />
Action/Sidescrolling:  XBox/PS2/Gamecube<br />
First-person shooters: XBox/PS2, Gamecube far behind, but has Metroid on the horizon<br />
Racing:  PS2-XBox tie, Gamecube far behind  (PS2 has the popular titles, but XBox blows away the graphics)<br />
WTH? (Games that don't belong anywhere else):  PS2/XBox/Gamecube<br />
<br />
The real answer is that there's no clear cut winner.  The PS2 is your safest bet just due to the sheer number of titles they have out, the PS2's bound to have at least one game out that people will like.  The XBox and Gamecube are a little more constrained - they both have better graphic abilities but have a much narrower selection of games.  Is broadband/internet play going to be important for you?  If so, the XBox: Live plug in has been the most impressive so far, in my opinion.  However, it does require that you have an active broadband connection (no dial up support), so you'll need to have cable or DSL already in the house.<br />
<br />
The best bet is to go to a toy/electronics store, grab a $200-300 gift certificate and let hubby pick one on his own.  That way he has no one to blame but himself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paldor</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that gaming consoles are a very personal choice.  People are usually very brand-loyal.<br />
<br />
Good Points:<br />
<br />
X-BOX: Harddrive for saves (nice, no memory card), a very few nice exculsive games (Halo, Steel Batallion), Built-in ability to LAN x-boxs together.<br />
<br />
PS2: Plays all origional Playstation games and PS2 games ( hundreds of games),  Some very nice exclusive games (Tekken, GTA, Final Fantasy, Metal Gear, Gran Turismo...), The ability to play DVDs right out of the box.<br />
<br />
Nintendo Game-Cube:  This has benefits, but I dont have one so its hard for me to comment on.<br />
<br />
Bad Points:<br />
<br />
X-Box:  Very limited software collection right now.<br />
PS2:  Lesser graphics and sound compared to the other systems.  (not bad, but not the best).<br />
Gamecube:  Software seems (mostly) focused on a younger audience (15 years old and younger).<br />
<br />
I would let your husband have a say in the decision.  Let him go out and try them and pick one he likes.<br />
<br />
If you want it to be a surprise, just take him to a best-buy since they usually have systems up that you can play. Say you want a DVD/Movie as an excuse) and challenge him to a game or two.. See which one he finds the most fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IndiWolf</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've had the game cube, and the ps2.. and now we have 2 xboxes.<br />
if i were to put my two cents in.. the xbox all the way. <br />
there's alot of argument between the too... but all in all i find the xbox much more graphically appealing and i like the controller more..<br />
/shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Galamar</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would suggest the PS2.  Graphics are getting dated since it is already a couple years old.  However, it does have the most games out there and your husband can pick whatever ones he likes.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have a broadband connection, you may want to ask his friends what they have.  Some guys like to call up their friends and do some online play - and now that can be done on gaming stations.    If you think your husband would want that, then X-Box is definately ahead of the field there.<br />
<br />
Their software can be pretty messy, but Microsoft sure knows who to contract to get decent hardware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NallowinDawnfeather</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have to say that i don't think PS2 has reached the limits of its graphical boundaries... <br />
<br />
Just look at what Squaresoft was able to do with Chrono Cross for the PS1, this was almost what you would expect from the next generation systems when PS2 was first coming out.  <br />
<br />
Ico was a graphically stunning game, when you actually played it.  <br />
<br />
When dealing with graphics you have to look at both the eye candy and the actual gameplay. <br />
<br />
I do agree that X-Box has a better engine graphics wise simply due to its more recent technology, but its not that far above and beyond the PS2... Look to developers such as Konami, Squaresoft, and W-Omega to push the graphics even farther.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the PS1 was anything to go by, early games are no indication of what the machine is actually capable of.<br />
<br />
Typical example, compare the graphics of FF7 vs. FF9, same console.  Or Ridge Racer vs. GT2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And by the word 'early' that might raise a few eyebrows... bear in mind that the PSone is *still* going strong after all these years!  Early is relative.  That's another plus of the PS consoles... they remain 'alive' for ages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fernwick</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The other next generation console graphics will improve also, however, and their more-powerful graphics chips and processors leave more room for growth than with the PS2. Also, while there are more PS2 games out there, their quality seems to be not quite up to par with those developed for the other consoles, and many of them seem to be similar (i.e. many versions of the same sports, etc).<br />
<br />
I recently researched all three consoles and eventually bought a GameCube (not for myself, however, but as a Christmas gift for a 12-year-old female relative).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">11-10-2002, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the PS2 may not have reached it's &quot;graphical limit,&quot; it stands that whatever the PS2 can do, it can be improved for the XBox.  That's just sheer numbers talking there - the XBox has more horsepower than the PS2.  If developers write for the XBox and &quot;dumb it down&quot; for the PS2, then you'll see a lot of difference between the two versions.  If a game is simultaniously released and written for the PS2 then ported to the XBox, well then it won't matter because the game was written for the PS2 and won't really push the XBox's abilities.<br />
<br />
I definately agree that it's all about gameplay, not just eye candy.  That's how the original Nintendo beat out the old Sega Master System.  Hardware-wise, the SMS was more advanced than the NES.  Unfortunately Sega couldn't produce enough quality titles to compare to Nintendo's onslaught.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mistress Khary</div><div class="date">11-15-2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I ended up buying an X-Box...<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help deciding!  Finally went with the hardware, plus some nifty little joystick thingy for fighting games, and bought him Dead or Alive 3, Shenmue II and Crazy Taxi 3 to have fun with.  Hope he likes it :)</div></div><hr />

Just kidding, best of luck with your purchase :)</div></div><hr />

Graphics isnt nothing its the games that mean anything. and 1 thing well make that 2 things Ps2 has that the other 2 dont have, Everquest Online Adventures and Final Fastasy Online. I'm in the everquest beta testing and it totally rocks I love it much better than old eq.</div></div><hr />

I'd choose the former easily. The price of a decent video card alone is comparable to the Xbox or PS2.<br />
<br />
Grats on your choice. Both Shenmue2 and DoA3 are excellent games. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aandaie</div><div class="date">11-22-2002, 12:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like xbox and ps2 but am thinking of PS2 for eqonline adventures, ff XI and such. FF XI will also be on PC, but with the broadband adapter I can do stuff on the PC and also play a ps2 netgame. <br />
<br />
Xbox comes with net capability, while the ps2 net adapter is a small price. So far EQOA for the ps2 or other such games does not require a hard drive.<br />
<br />
Like Kenuoun, I grow tired of upgrading a pc. I just upgraded from a p2 400, 512 meg ram, geforce 2 64 meg mx card, etc to a new case/mboard/celeron 1.8 ghz proc that otherwise use the old stuff for 208 bucks. This is not THAT bad considering my last upgrade to the p2 400 was 2 years ago.<br />
I only managed this upgrade so cheap because I found one of the few NEW system boards that can use pc 133 SDRAM still, which is what I had. The move from just a p2 400 to the celeron 1.8 ghz is pretty amazing really.<br />
<br />
My next upgrade will be to a geforce 4 128 meg card of some kind and later some ddram (my board now can use one or the other ;)  ) which will then give me my old p2400 back with 512 meg ram and the geforce 2 64 meg card, for some possible two boxing ;). <br />
<br />
I am considering waiting for that new geforce card though.. bleah. I really need to get in the SWG beta to see if my current setup will be adequate until new products like EQ2 requiring pixel and vertex shading make me get a new card.<br />
It looks like next gen cards will take most of the load off the CPU making constant full computer upgrades moot. They keep saying that though ;) Its getting to the point where you should not need more than around 2 ghz.. I mean.. jeez.<br />
<br />
XBOX REALLY needs some quality xbox only MMORPG titles to make it a must buy. Even the sims online or something would do it for a lot of people. Its ironic that its set up for it out of the box more than the PS2 yet there is nothing for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tettsuo1</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the PS2 for one reason:  Superior game selection<br />
<br />
Having the choice of 7 great games as opposed to 2 great games, the 7 will win everytime.  Graphics ain't everything, and that's been proven over and over again in the gaming market.  Give the consumer more options (doesn't have to be great options), you'll get the money, and game producers will go where the money is.</div></div><hr />
