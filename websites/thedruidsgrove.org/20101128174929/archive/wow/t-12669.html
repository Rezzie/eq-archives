<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">06-09-2008, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horde guild Axiom of Scarlet Crusade (CST) is recruiting!<br />
<br />
We are seeking dedicated players to join us for our remaining time in SWP and forge ahead with us in WotLK.<br />
<br />
About us: Axiom is a progression-focused PvE guild. We've cleared 5/5 Hyjal and 9/9 Black Temple. We are currently working on Kalecgos (best attempt Kalec 20% and Sath 16%). We cleared 6/6 SSC and 4/4 TK prior to 2.4. We have ZA on farm and complete the timed event for the bear mount.<br />
<br />
We’re a weird bunch of guys and gals with a decidedly odd sense of humor. We get a kick out of dirty jokes and stupid one-liners, but when it's time to down a boss we are as focused as they come. We are not a PG guild -- we do swear on Vent and in chat. If you’re looking for an off-beat group with a serious raiding focus, Axiom is the place for you.<br />
<br />
Recruiting:<br />
<br />
High Priority<br />
Tank x2: Feral Druid, Protection Warrior<br />
Healers x1-2: Holy Paladin, Resto Druid<br />
<br />
Medium Priorty<br />
Healers x1: Resto Shaman<br />
<br />
Low Priority<br />
DPS x2: Enhancement Shaman, Mage<br />
Exceptional applications for all classes/specs will be considered.<br />
<br />
Raid Schedule:<br />
<br />
Sunwell/BT: Wednesday, Thursday, Monday from 6-10 pm CST, Sunday from 7-10 pm CST<br />
<br />
Karazhan (Badge farming): Friday 6:30 CST, optional raid<br />
<br />
ZA: Saturday at 6 pm CST, optional raid (will likely drop after 3.0.2)<br />
<br />
What we are looking for:<br />
<br />
Please note that we're recruiting active raiders, not benchwarmers. Beyond that, here’s what we’re looking for in an applicant:<br />
<br />
Attitude: Axiom has a strong raiding core made up of players who are dedicated to the guild. We are seeking players with the same sense of dedication, players who want to find a home, to raid with us in SWP and WotLK. That doesn't we’re all dead serious over here -- we’re goofy as hell. For this reason applicants must have a sense of humor and enjoy all manner of shenanigans and general insanity. Finally, we are focused on raiding and progression, so applicants must have the maturity to know when to buckle down and focus.<br />
<br />
Gear and Experience: Gear and experience do not necessarily equate skill and we are, above all, seeking skilled players. However, we would prefer applicants be in full T5/ZA/2.4 BoJ gear or better and we would prefer applicants who have experience with Hyjal and BT. We will consider less geared and/or experienced applicants who submit strong applications.<br />
<br />
Availability and Raid Preparation: Applicants must be able to attend at least 75% of our raids -- we are not in the market for casual raiders. In addition, we take raid preparation seriously. Applicants must be motivated to gather consumables, gather gold for repairs, research raid strategies and research ways to improve their output. We do review our raiders on a monthly basis, so minimum-effort players need not apply.<br />
<br />
Finally, we are looking for people who have a strong desire to conquer endgame content and have fun doing it!<br />
<br />
Loot System:<br />
<br />
Players generate ranked lists (size of list determined by raid rank) of the items they need in order of priority. At the start of each month players update their lists and meet with their class leads to go over them. These lists are used to create a master list that determines loot distribution for each new month.<br />
<br />
This may sound unusual but it has worked very well for us. Loot distribution is efficient and drama free. Please feel free to contact us if you have specific questions about how this works.<br />
<br />
How to apply:<br />

Really ... I found that rogues are more useful than us ferals at this level of progression ... I feel that blizz at the T6 level forces us to heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ziada</div><div class="date">06-09-2008, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We like to have ferals around because it's useful to have someone that can help with OT duties but also put out respectable DPS when not tanking. Leader of the Pack is also a nice buff to have around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still seeking one more feral druid to round out our roster. We'll be starting on Kalecgos this month!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">06-26-2008, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And mangle is teh awesome for their rogues.<br />
<br />
This is actually something of a misconception.  If you look at the stats on a rogue's dps, something like 8% of their dps actually comes from bleed effects, compared with 35% when we speak of a feral druid.  In short you would need to have at least 4 rogues in your raid for the feral druid to even consider keeping Mangle up all the time for them.  It's up most of the time anyway just from our own rotations..<br />
<br />
Rogues have the 2nd most bleed dps output, followed by warriors.<br />
<br />
So really mangle doesn't make that much difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, a skilled feral druid is always good to have in a raid because when shxt hits the fan, a skilled feral druid will SAVE THE DAY.  We are ideally positioned to do this because of spells like tranquility, our instant cast heals, our ability to offtank at a moment's notice and generally to fill any gap that is created in a raid without a second's hesitation.<br />
<br />
Mangle really should not be that much of a consideration.  Now leader of the pack, on the other hand... that is a valuable buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck with your search for a feral duriod, Ziada :&gt;  And grats on Illidan !<br />
