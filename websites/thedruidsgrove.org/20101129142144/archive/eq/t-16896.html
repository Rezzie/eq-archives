<br />
I thought it was amazing to see lines of people happy to wait hours and hours in line, simply because they were too excited to wait until today to vote.  <br />
<br />
How many times in my life have I seen people excited about voting? Maybe the last time this sort of enthusiasm was experienced was when blacks or women won the right to vote.   I think this is the first time ever.  The last 8 years have been horrible voting experiences for me.  I wasn't all that excited about the candidate my party put up and I was down right horrified over the opposition.   I don't remember much about Clinton's election, I think I wasn't paying close attention.<br />
<br />
I'd describe my emotions as excited with a touch of nervousness.</div></div><hr />

I feel nervous that some assh0le will get in his head to assassinate him.  I'll probably have to get used to that feeling for a while.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention the blatant monopoly between 2 political parties. Until then, I can always vote for a senator or a representative for a moderate to independent viewpoint from time to time.</div></div><hr />

Watch if you want a blast from the very recent past.  Two russian guys singing to Sarah Palin.<br />

Seems like if you want to have any chance at influencing things then probably voting in a primary would be a good idea.  It's just so hard to get you danged moderates excited over anything!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">11-06-2008, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I wanted to compare popular vote over the last 3 elections:<br />
<br />
2000<br />
Republican 47.87% (Bush)<br />
Democrat 48.38% (Gore) (Ruh roh, lost electoral vote though)<br />
<br />
2004<br />
Republican 50.7 (Bush)<br />
Democrat 48.3 (Kerry)<br />
<br />
2008<br />
Republican 46% (McCain)<br />
Democrat 52% (Obama)<br />
<br />
Finally a nice margin. :)<br />
<br />
The exit polls were interesting.  The one number that sticks in my brain was that 10% fewer Republicans voted this year.  They just had no enthusiasm for their candidate.</div></div><hr />
