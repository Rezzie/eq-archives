Powerful Earthstorm Diamond (http://www.thottbot.com/?i=60111) be better for druids?<br />

I have over 8k hp in my solo gear.  I'd much rather throw on a gem with attack power and something else than worry about a paltry 40-60 healing.  The problem with items that proc is sometimes they don't proc.  Then that part of the item becomes useless.  your lack of control over when the item procs makes it less useful in my opinion.<br />
<br />
For tanking stick with the Powerful Earthstorm</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Tenacious one only heals like 35-60 from what a guildmate told me. Doesn't seem worth it.<br />
<br />
and 5% Stun Resist is always nice...</div></div><hr />

35-60 healing seem very little, apart from that you need to fill atleast 8 gem slots for it to work, the PED seem alot better then, with the scaling stam.</div></div><hr />

So it would seem unless you're in oomkin form or caster then it wouldn't be very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">03-16-2007, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chance on hit does work.  Take for instance the Hourglass of the Unraveler.  This has a chance on hit to increase your attack power and procs quite nicely for me in both cat and bear form.  The only 'chance on hit' that doesn't work for us is 'chance on hit' that is placed on a weapon.  Since we never swing the weapon in feral forms, it never hits (yeah, logic in a game where humanoids change into beasts).  I would assume (and bet) that the Tenacious Earthstorm Diamond works fine in both bear and cat.</div></div><hr />
