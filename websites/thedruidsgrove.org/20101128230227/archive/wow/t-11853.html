Of course if you only tank non-heroic 5-mans you don't need to be crit immune.<br />
The 3% bonus on all stats is not to shabby either.<br />
<br />
The 15% additional resistance Primal Tenacity gives you helps when tanking, but not much. Basically you resist one fear out of seven. In PvP, it is great. <br />
<br />
So if you do not plan on tanking any hard instances and want to do a lot of PvP it should be no problem to go for Primal Tenacity.</div></div><hr />
