<br />
Have a question for you. I finally got WoW installed and patched, but it can never connect to the News Server. The first window is always blank and says can't connect.<br />
<br />
I can play just fine though. Weird, very weird. Anyone have a suggestion?</div></div><hr />

If so, try adding WoWLauncher.exe to the &quot;Allow to Connect&quot; or whatever list.</div></div><hr />

But, if I click the PLAY button in the lower right corner, I can play WoW fine. Got my Rogue to level 7 so far and my wife's Druid to level 4.<br />

It's totally weird. Look at the launcher next time you start WoW and take a look at what I'm sayin. I don't understand.</div></div><hr />

This happens to be a little less than half the time I start it up and I really don't bother. Sometimes I see the news and sometimes I don't. If you really want to know, go to www.worldofwarcraft.com and read the frontpage because that is usually what is on there.</div></div><hr />

I also agree with the advise... if you really care about the news, head to the main page it is &quot;always&quot; just a list of recent news items.  Never have I seen it used for any breaking/urgent news like server outages or emergency maintaince or free loots.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I understood what you were saying and my suggestion still stands.  If your firewall isn't allowing WoWLauncher (or whatever it's called) to connect to the internet, you might get something like that.</div></div><hr />

Zonealarm is configured to allow WoW and I have my routers ports forwarded as per the tech help section.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind though, the launcher is a separate app from WoW and will need to be enabled separately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Launcher.exe is what is first executed when you double click the shortcut on your desktop.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure you have configured WoW.exe to get outside, just make sure ZoneAlarm isn't blocking Launcher.exe</div></div><hr />
