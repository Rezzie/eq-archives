<br />
Moonkin form but no Natural Shapeshifter or OoC?? <br />

Most of the other stuff can be chocked up to quirky choices, but you MUST have Moonglow in any balance build, whether you take moonkin or not.  It is simply the most important talent for casters (even healers).  Mana consumption and the management of it is the key to playing moonkin, make your spells cheaper man.<br />
<br />
The furor is okay, if you take the natural weapons and OOC, with decent AC panzerkin gear you can alternately be a pretty good bear, otherwise drop furor for improved mark.<br />
<br />
I have IS for when I am MH PuGs, but with this build you won't use it.<br />
<br />
Improved roots is not necessary, especially if you are spending all those point in NG, that is what you will use if you are getting hit.<br />
<br />
Natural Shapeshifter will save you tons of mana, and make shifting to moonkin much more cost effective, and other forms too.<br />
<br />
Because of our mana issues, I don't mind the reflection (I have it as well), but you might want to consider splitting points between focus and iHT.  None of those points in resto really help your healing (unless you are getting hit at the time).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">06-02-2006, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are getting it with that 41/0/10 one, but I am not sure about the 5 points in nature's focus.  You don't have any other healing talents (improved mark doesn't count), and most of the time if you are getting hit while healing a group you have other issues.<br />
<br />
For healing as moonkin, outside your best bet is to root and back off to heal, or go bear to frenzied regen (in which case furor will work much better for you than those 5 points in focus if you really want to keep mark) while still keeping your uber armor.<br />
<br />
Also if you are horde don't forget you can warstomp to give yourself some relief from taking damage to get a heal off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the first one I would take natural shapeshifter over the improved range.  Without Moonkin form you will need to go bear for defense, and you will likely be low on mana from casting nukes and heals.  If it is too expensive you'll get stuck squishy and die.  24/0/27 is the more traditional build, dropping iSF and getting stronger heals up through two ranks of iRegrowth which plays of Natures Grace well.  I would also recommend swapping iMotW for furor, since as I said you will be in bear more, and that frenzied regen will be a good friend.<br />
<br />
Your second build looks pretty strong for a balance heavy build with the ability to give some faster HTs in a pinch.  I like it best from the ones you have suggested.</div></div><hr />
