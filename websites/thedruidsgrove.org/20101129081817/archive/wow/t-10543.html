I didn't make a poll, because I don't know them all. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

And you have both sides that vary.  I did Dire Maul for the first time and loved it. This is a really tough question because they are good for different reasons.  Appearance, loots, difficulty.  I think if I had to choose one it would be MARAUDON.  and this is mainly due the combination of all three of the above reasons.  DId Onyxia for the first time about a week ago and that was eye candy. But it's not really a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

SM for the Variety and ZF because I can use Roots/Nature's Grasp<br />

Long, and I hate those stupid alarms!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Always hated Gnomer and Ulda.<br />
<br />
I have grown very fond of LBRS, but I HATE it with a crappy group.  With a good group, 5 or 10 man it is a GREAT instance, with a bad group ( regardless of size ) the instance is PURE HELL.</div></div><hr />

I love chasing the imp, and finally fighting it while it becomes hugemongous in DM East. I love the tribute runs and becoming King of the Gordoks of DM North. I love breaking the shield to fight the beast in DM West and finally discovering and destroying the true villain behind the story.<br />
<br />
Haha, and I luv fighting Bloodlord Mandokir in ZG, and hearing him say &quot;ding&quot; with the occasional &quot;gratz!&quot; from the npcs. :D</div></div><hr />

Fun encounters, different mobs and strats thoughout the zone, and can be done with just about any bizarre combination of classes you can come up with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maraudon, primarily from an aesthetic standpoint<br />
ZF / ZG cause I can root and mount<br />
ST cause I like putting things to sleep<br />
DM.  Pleasing to the eye, and fun/tough fights.  Killer loot.<br />
<br />
Most Hated:<br />
<br />
BRD.  I hate all of BRD, especially the Jailbreak sequence<br />
Uldamann.  I always get lost.  No matter what.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaEsoteric</div><div class="date">05-06-2006, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like AQ 20 as well, being able to use our roots is invaluable in the Gen Rajaxx fight.  Im so glad Blizz didnt gimp our already gimped crowd control in every dungeon.<br />
<br />
I only dislike UBRS do to how many times I've had to run it for various quests.<br />
<br />
I love Black Wing Lair as well.  My guild normally does it in one night.  From about 7pm to 11:30 (2 sccepter shards in 2 weeks!).  It is a very challenging raid zone with not nearly as large as other dungeons but It is basically 8 Boss Events in a row with some pulls of in between.<br />
<br />
AQ is a fun instance as well and is definately designed for a druid to come along, with all the poisons and being outdoors that extra root never hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurg</div><div class="date">05-06-2006, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My favorite would prolly be Maradon as well, my priest used to live in that zone and back when they could solo the princess i used to do it 4 or 5 times a day for DE mats it was great fun and i cant wait untill my leedle drood is old enough to get in :) 41 today and screaming up fast!<br />
<br />
My least favorite would have to be Uld... I HATE that zone that or BRD, BRD is fun but i have done it soooo many times now that it makes me want to jam sporks in my own eyes  :P</div></div><hr />

Two &quot;hell yea&quot; moments for me were in Deadmines and RFD. I've never played an alliance character so I was on my alt shaman when I saw someone asking for more on a run to deadmines. WTH, I'll give it a try. Lots of fun, walking in and seeing a pirate ship was sweet. <br />
<br />
The other one in RFD is when you come up to a huge pile of bones with a skeleton dancing on top of it. First time there for all of us. Warrior goes charging up there and 783 other skeletons join the fight. Good times...<br />

<br />
Deadmines: I love this dungeon, the creativity and the series of quests that lead up to it.  The bosses are great.  You land lubbers are tougher than I thought!<br />
<br />
Scarlet Monastery: I love the theme, and it's fun to do.<br />
<br />
Zul'Furrak: I love the part on the staircase, that's always challenging.<br />
<br />
Maraudon:  Just started it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiskrens</div><div class="date">02-21-2007, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Must say that ZF's got a special place in memory, even after all this time raiding and in Outland. Maybe just because it was one of the first instances where you could start acting your class (there's so much missing pre-40 for any class), that it's relatively easy to get a group to and get into, and because it has some nice events that for instance (no pun intended :grin:) SM doesn't. But SM comes close in atmosphere</div></div><hr />
