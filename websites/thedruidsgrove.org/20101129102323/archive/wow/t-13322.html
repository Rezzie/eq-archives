Well, the Tree is now our tank and the Shammy has moved on to another guild.<br />

So, that leaves me (by default) Big Tree on Campus, so-to-speak.  <br />

I've always healed in the traditional manner which, as of last night, no longer exists.  The &quot;rotation&quot; I'm used to is now Kaput.<br />
<br />
I haven't raided since the patch, but I'd like some input from those of you who have and have discovered new strategies.<br />

I ran Heroic VH as Boomkin last night....it glitched....and one portal stayed up spawning adds to attack the entrance the entire time we ran.  So we downed the portal guardians and bosses and then ran back to the door to take care of the extra adds due to the glitch.<br />
<br />
I was not wearing a full DpS set.  Only what I've managed to accumulate so far as an &quot;off-set&quot; while raiding as a tree.  And, I've not even had the chance to gem or enchant what I have accumulated thus far.<br />
<br />
Without breaks between bosses, the lowest my mana EVER got was about 80%.  This was with constant hurricanes, a couple of tranquilities and whatever else I could come up with to control the never-ending adds.<br />

The Boomkin within me danced with glee, but the Tree within me weeped in despair.</div></div><hr />

Our druid healer was playing (yeah!), so i made a point to ask him monitor his mana usage now with 3.1 out.  Only one time did I see him drop below 50% (though I wasn't watching him constantly) and he still did 45% of the heals. (http://wowwebstats.com/5sxpdcnt5cgpu)  That surprised me, as I expected him to suffer a bit.  Guess not.  Though we did have an excessive amount of mana regen for a 10-man (3 pallies, shadow priest and a shammy).<br />
<br />
After talking with him about his healing techniques, I really think he could get quite a bit better, but he does so well now, he has no reason to change his habits.  Even after 3.1.</div></div><hr />

Well, I've decided to go with the 14/0/57 build using the Innervate, Rejeuv and Nourish Glyphs. Even in the past, I've always been rather wasteful of my mana and can't deny that Innervate is my friend.  <br />

Not sure why as I've only been with my new guild for a few weeks.  Probably a Kara carryover???  That said, I've read that 10-man Uldar was designed to be healed by 3, so I guess it is a good practice.  The nice (for me anyway) thing about having 3 healers, is good DPS'rs become far more important.  I've been doing great at DPS, so I know I'll never have to sit out.</div></div><hr />

Oh yes, we do too.  However, our shammy did dps quite often while attending the raid as a &quot;healer&quot;.  I guess depending on the situation.  <br />
<br />
I agree, average DpS is certainly noticeable, but 3-man healing makes the raid so much more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of both.<br />
<br />
25 Man OS + 10 Man Naxx<br />
<br />
For every major trash pull and boss I made sure that my HoT's were on the tanks.  Then I'd focus on the raid.  If the situation allowed, I'd keep my Hot's up while topping with Nourish (on the tanks).  <br />
<br />
And, I apologise for sounding like a pompous twit for even mentioning the meters......  <br />
<br />
but, the best I've ever done in Heroic OS is 4th and I think I've only topped the Naxx meter once or twice in a dozen runs.<br />
<br />
I'm not one to even want to look at a meter let alone post the results on the grove.  But I wanted to stress that the Patch really didn't hurt us trees at all.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to agree - I've done Naxx10 and the first two bosses of Ulduar so far, and I don't think my overall mana regen has suffered much.<br />
<br />
I had a moment of panic when I saw my OO5SR regen had lost 2-300 points, but since I spend virtually all of combat time within the 5SR, it really hasn't made a difference.  So far.<br />
<br />
Have Naxx25 and EoE10 coming up this weekend, we'll see then.<br />
<br />
@tlbj142: that's a good post to read if Wild Growth targeting is wonky for you.  I can't say I've noticed any issues, but I'm converting to Erdluf's macro anyway, just for the elegance of it.<br />

<br />
My guild is trying to prepare me for Naxx 10 healing (and I'm really new to this whole, non-tanking world), so I was wondering what type of rotations you guys are using?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">04-21-2009, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Magellan, did you change your rotation from the old style with LB and such?<br />
<br />
Definately changed my LB style.  I no longer bother to stack.  I let it bloom.  I've been using Nourish since it came out, so that wasn't much of a switch for me.  <br />
<br />
Tanks:  Regrowth, (1) LB, Rejuv, fill with Nourish (when they need it) and repeat sequence when HoT's wear off.<br />
<br />
Party:  Rejuv's and a Nourish on damage takers, then target a caster and throw a Wild Growth.<br />
<br />
Looking at the WWS - it's apparent that I've joined the ranks of the &quot;Nourish Spammers&quot;.  It's not perfect, but my overheals were quite acceptable and not once did I come close to running out of mana.<br />
<br />
Works for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-22-2009, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fun little trick for those like me, who were not big &quot;Nourishers&quot; before the patch!<br />
<br />
Swap your regrowth and noursih buttons around (or in my case, changed Healbot buttons around).<br />
<br />
Seems like any situation that I used to use Regrowth in now I use nourish, and I heal much more efficiently!<br />
<br />
I still have to remember not to stack LB, and keep telling myself its ok if the tank is below 70% HP!  :)  <br />
<br />
I used to be busting out my swiftmend whenever a tank dropped below ~75%, now I just wait for LB to bloom, and the tank is back to full health. (Holy LB crits batman!!!)</div></div><hr />

I pugged Spider Wing last night, and definitely found out how big of a mana hit stacking lifebloom has become. Two tank stacks = massive mana drain.<br />
<br />
I've been waiting on the Nourish glyph before I change my style much, but I think I'll have to do like you guys have found - stop stacking LB, let the health drop some, then Nourish (+Rejuv/RG HoTs) it back up.<br />
<br />
Sadly Blizz seems to be encouraging us away from preemptive healing. :-(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes and No.<br />
<br />
We certainly can't keep a continuos stream of 2k+ HPS on multiple targets like we used to! :cool: <br />
<br />
But, you can still pre-emptive heal with LB and Rejv without terrible mana consequenses.  Rather than stacking LB though, you just let one bloom.  The bloom crits are insane!  Far more healing than the ticks would ever amount to alone.  So its not a bad change just....different.  In patched together gear that I pickup while tanking, I was having LB Blooms +20k.  <br />
<br />
They suck to try and time, so I just treat them as a bonus!  <br />
<br />
Keep the tank between 35%-70% and let LB top them off for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read that as long as you only keep one stack up, you are fine (assuming you are tanking healing).  But two stacks is a no-no now.</div></div><hr />

When Nourish came out, I moved Regrowth so far down my hot bar I almost forgot about it.  I've since placed them closer together only separated by LB and Rejuv.  They've gotten along nicely.<br />

I thought it was simply leveled by Inscribers.Nope. All of the new glyphs added in 3.1 require you to randomly learn them from a very rare world drop book.  The book is BoE so it is possible for someone other than a inscriber to pickup the book.  &quot;Reading&quot; the book teaches you one random glyph (of the 60 new ones released in 3.1).</div></div><hr />

Our guild's head inscriptionist just learned Wild Growth the other day, so hopefully if we keep feeding her the books we find, she'll learn the Nourish one soon.  I saw one on AH yesterday for 250g.  As much as I want it, I'm not going to pay that for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still LB the tank(s), but I let the stack expire at 3 and reapply weaving around Rejuve, Regrowth and Nourish with the odd swiftmend as required.  I'm not seeing much problem with Mana (yet) though the first couple of times, liberally chucking around lifebloom was entertaining &quot;all my mana's gone! Oh no, there it is again&quot;.<br />
<br />
I do find healing a lot more flexible and involved than pre-patch. With Lifebloom, sometimes it's worthwhile stacking to 3, sometimes I might just leave one up and lob other heals around instead. <br />
<br />
Nourish still feels like a bit of an afterthought to me though. I guess it's nice having a reactive heal that can be applied quicker than HT, but most of its power relies on having your target hotted up and yourself glyhped and having 4 x T7 bonus as far as I can see.<br />
<br />
I like being a HoT healer and it just seems an odd direction to push us down but I guess change is good sometimes and I am enjoying the changes to healing so far.<br />
<br />
(I've not spent a huge amount of time, as I would normally, scouring sites like EJ for strategies to date, thought I'd suck it and see how it goes, so apologies if I missed something obvious and am talking out of my knothole).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">05-05-2009, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have only healed 2 raids since patch, done mostly tanking, but I have found that the newer LB strategies work very nice for several of the boss encounters in Ulduar.  Applying a LB, then a Rejv, on a target going into a &quot;grip&quot; type situation (Slack pot/Kolgron's Grab...etc) really eases the stress on other healers. It seems that the LB blooms right when the targets are taking the worst of it, and tops them off just before &quot;Release&quot;.  <br />
<br />
My main change was obviosly to reglyph, (using WG, Nourish, Swift) now and swap my Regrowth with Nourish on my cast bar (or healbot button).  I used to be a Regrowth whore, now I just use it when I have down time to help on a tank if I am splash healing.  Been using lots more Nourish, but I think the better healers were doing that before the patch anyway (Old habits die hard).  I have not been LB stacking, but I have also not done much MT healing since patch (Except heroics and they don't hit hard enough to warrant more than Rejv/Nourish)</div></div><hr />

I was blaming nourish and our priest chucking a heal down just before nourish hit. Closer examination shows it's Lifebloom being naughty and I'd really underestimated the bloom so it wasn't unusual, as per pre-patch to finish a fight with a 3 stack blooming on a fully healed tank for somewhere in the region of 10-12k.<br />

More practice required methinks.</div></div><hr />

LOLZ - I picked one up just for kicks and I gotta tell ya, I'm lovin' it!  I've started running 25 mans with a raiding guild and haven't had any major healing or mana problems since the patch so I thought &quot;what the heck, I'll give it a go&quot;.  <br />

I really like not having to wait around to heal up a b-rez target.  Sometimes (and all trees know what I'm talking about) it takes them forever to accept a b-rez and you're left wondering &quot;Wtf......helloooo?  I'm kind of busy here.  Hurry up already.&quot;<br />

What???  No Glyph of WG?   I suppose if you are not the raid healer its not too big of a deal. However if you are raiding Ulduar I strongly reccomend it!  Almost everyboss has an ability that produces massive raid wide damage!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My 2 raid teams are pretty much sailing through 10 and 25 man Naxx so I thought I'd play with the Rebirth Glyph just for kicks.  <br />
<br />
I will be picking up WG soon enough, Ulduar is just around the corner.</div></div><hr />
