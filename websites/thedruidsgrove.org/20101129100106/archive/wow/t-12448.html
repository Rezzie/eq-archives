So I'm sitting at 65 and considering going with a Dreamstate build because I like to heal and think it's good enough to be the healer in most instances. A 34/0/27 build is what I'm considering. With healing gear is this viable as a healer? I've done some of the instances as a tree and find I'm usually more than 60% mana after fights. I'm not talking about doing Heroics but regular UB or Hellfire's. <br />
<br />
I think with Imp Rejuv, Gift of Nature, Moonglow and Dreamstate I should be fine in healing. I've never really used Nature's Swiftness + Healing Touch but is that a necessary combo with a Dreamstate build? I figure between Lifebloom and Rejuv I should be good but does healing become vastly diffferent than a full Resto build?</div></div><hr />

It's probably won't make much of a difference either way but I'm a bit paranoid about taking hits while soloing LOL. I wish we had a snare so we can kite like in EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blueboy</div><div class="date">03-05-2008, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tested the Dreamstate and Tree of life build when I converted my druid back to healing, which I love a lot. I got some nice feed back from the other healers in the guild and found that their stress level in healing Kara went down when i was a 41+ tree spec with all my HoT's I put out. I don't really rank high on the healing chart, and my gear is about +850 unbuff and 1k+ buffed.<br />
<br />
I do find not so good in tree of life build to grind it out on my quest. Farming not so bad since I am herb/alchy. i haven't done heroic as a healer so I need to really get my gear up.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

It wasn't the best group, no real tank, 2 warriors both arms speced and 2 hunters but 1 was a 70 with a bear pet and the other had a flying snake pet. With really funky aggro problems, I ended up healing the snake on some fights, others I was healing everyone. I didn't get much DPS in but was able to handle heals so I'm sold on the usefulness of this build. I don't know how it will work as a 70 raiding but it's ok for leveling.</div></div><hr />

As a 42 soon to be 43 druid, which talents should I take first?  My time is 50/50 healing dungeon crawls and solo questing.<br />
<br />
My first thought was to grab the balance talents first for survivability and add the healing talents as I continue to level, but will I be too gimp of a healer from now until 70 to be effective as the only healer in a group?<br />

You want to raid just go Tree :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a really fun spec, and I mean fun.  I've got awesome mana regen for healing and pewpew and groups, and my glass jaw as a caster is a little less delicate in Boomkin form due to the armor bonus.  Not to mention the 900+ Starfire crits and the 1608 crit heal I pulled off last night.<br />
<br />
Plus I have fair cat/bear gear and so can use all my forms effectively when necessary.  Just an all around good time.<br />
<br />
I know I'll end up as a tree in the end, but the next 25 levels are going to be a hoot!  (Pun intended!)<br />

I'm a viable healer in instances up to Crypts and Mana Tombs so far. Soloability is much better than when I was a tree. The only problem is I don't think it's viable raiding but that's not for a couple of levels yet.</div></div><hr />
