Ofc there will be new talents. But you know blizz, they tend to swap things around and invent new talents along the way.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling they just put all of their &quot;ideas&quot; into the alpha build just to see how they'd play out.  I suspect some will get tweaked, some will get removed and others will get moved around within the tree.<br />
<br />
Let me know when it is on the PTR and, then, I'll get excited.</div></div><hr />

Dunno about you, but I've been rocking for a while now. Cat DPS might not be the best in the universe, but bear tanking is amazingly good against single targets (especially those that don't cast spells) and being able to do top 10 DPS with just a gear change makes warriors want to kill us and paladins hate us that much more.<br />
<br />
And ask your melee group or your hunters whether or not ferals rock.<br />
<br />
If anything, ferals are a victim of their own success; because they can switch to DPS, they don't get to tank as much because warriors/paladins are useless in that regard. <br />
<br />
Maybe you're talking about something like pvp. Druids have two specs that work fine in pvp. I don't see why all three trees need to.</div></div><hr />
