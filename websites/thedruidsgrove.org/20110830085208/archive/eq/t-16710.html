been a while since I was that level are the undead in Natimbi off the camp still good?? remember the mobs randomly dropping a good selling necklace.<br />
I would give the Steppes a try in the Serpent's Spine era, even go up to Icefall Glacier to charm mammoths.</div></div><hr />

The items that you should hold onto Tungsten/Cobalt ore (500ppish per on my server) Soluble Loam(3-4keach) Excellent/Superb silk (250ppish i believe) and Superb Spinneret Fluid/Excellent Marrow (should be 2-3k).  If you kite tables for acouple hours a week you should rack up quite a bit of these and be able to sell them quick in baz (probably to buyers set up in buyer side).  If you cannot handle PoFire currently I'd suggest doing NC as well for some levels or AAs until you can do PoFire (probably around 65 if you are just comming back to the game).  From 65-71 PoFire is great then from 71+ Swarm kiting is the only way to go, Icefall(71-76) first then Loping Plains Gators(76-80)</div></div><hr />
