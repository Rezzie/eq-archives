he said hello and told me that they were just popping into servers to see what was going on, (although I bet he was looking for platspammers or something) or maybe was talking to another player while I was bothering him. He still entertained me since I hadnt seen a GM in forever.<br />
<br />
Any of you guys have GM stories of late?<br />
<br />
Mod Edit (Netura): Moved this to general, since it didn't really fit in unkempt!</div></div><hr />

I had just got off the boat in BS when I get the tell &quot;Hi this is GM &quot; &quot; what can I help you with today&quot;  of course I umm respectfully say something like 'umm what?' and the Gnome appears before me.<br />
/Sigh like send a gnome to rename a DE Necro...<br />
We chatted a bit confirmed that I had asked for the surname, and he awarded the name.<br />
At this time he somehow made Oyvay and Trebuul Huge (tho they looked small to each other, oh and he turned Trebuul (Vah Shir Bard) into the ugliest human female bard I've ever seen ;)<br />
Grins It was different and another positive customer service experience.<br />

Before we started, he turned about half the raid into baby white dragons.  It was fun, though we didn't put on a very good show as it ended up being one of our worst attempts yet. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">02-27-2008, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have some old stories, some of which I could not tell anyone about unfortunately. They used to do arena events last man standing competitions about every other week for awhile during peak raiding hours. So, I used to get an easier bracket, eesh trying to kill multiple raiding Pallies blew. I always used to get disqualified alot during these events. <br />
<br />
Even a few times a Gm did the no no of /killing me. Some of their rules were easily exploitable, like the no invisability and illusion clauses as well as the levitate clause. They said go and I would mass group share wolf form(and blocking my own of course!) or I think it was feral spirit as well. They turned themselves into wolves! That is against the rules! The Foilage Shield while not a bug, wasn't intended, so, that was funny to use, especially on mages and beastlords! I also used alot of Area of effects around lots of players, so, I would often hit the Gm's as well, killing them outright at times. That would get a dq as well.<br />
<br />
The worst dq, and I was running on the platform in the old arena(after so long they called us in to slug it out to the finish) I had was when I was mana stoning against a Pally, Bard and a Monk left standing at the end. It made the Bard ld,while manastoning, or so they said, so, I killed the bard with dots while he was ld(ya, suxors, but, well, I was being chased). It was sad, was beating the other two down as well.<br />
<br />
Another fun event there was a neat trick with blinding opponents, via sunbeam flash of light or whatever, and surrounding Npc's would start beating that player down. So, this Gm was toggling his PvP status everytime he was getting beat down, So, I used this at first chance. After making him run out of dreadlands from Gore(turned him into a wolf!) I used sunbeam on him while I was one on one with him it turned into a massacre in firiona vie.<br />
<br />
Another fun Pvp event was in western wastes(by the way that place sucks for pvp events, very few people have Cov faction, so, it turns into train town with chaos fluxors)I used the local wildlife as pets, and was charming the mobs sicking them on the gm, watching him beat on it for a bit(mind you while I am kiting more mobs!). Then I would break charm, have him take aggro from former pet, then, send another one at him! Eventually he caught on and kept warping on me, so, I took him on allittle trip, to see the bottom of a cliff! Watching him warp and fall to his death was just awesome!<br />
<br />
The next part of that event was in dragons necropolis, I used some nifty tricks and took that gm to the bottom of the river, it connects to the lava pool and has rats swimming in it, I just wall cornered myself and healed until he drowned. He couldn't figure out how to get out. Gotta love the weird places next to no one ever sees or goes looking for. If, I had thought of it at the time I could have wolfed him in front of Jaled Dar for the win!<br />
<br />
Now, the next to last part was in Siren's Grotto, by this point a bunch of people had shown up, and because they didn't bother to invis themselves but, expected heals, I ended up having to egress myself and let about 10 idiots die to the train they caused trying to get in on the action. But, I had been planning to charm a walrus and break charm and watch him die getting beat down by the moktors, bulthars, seahorses, and siren's! Then, egressing out!<br />
<br />
The last part to that quest was back in Western Wastes, now remember the part I told you about Claws of Veeshan faction and how no one had it, except me. Well, when the gm spawned the mech Dragon, and bunch of chaos fluxxors wandered to zone in, and of course, with being on heal duty while the idiots aggro extra things, those extra chaos fluxxors beat me down, but, I was alive and healing long enough to get the job done. And since no clerics were there the Gm's were kind enough to give me a res afterwards.<br />
<br />
It was funny, after all those Gm event's and things like that, I had developed a notorious streak with guides and gm's, as they had all heard of my dirty tactics lol.</div></div><hr />

But I talk to him everytime I see him and ask him many questions and he answers  them and we can carry a conversation for about 15 minutes or so. I just wish there was more GM's like him cause a couple of them i talked to in the past weren't as calm and helpful as Gurashin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TauTropfen</div><div class="date">01-05-2009, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allright ... where to start ... <br />
<br />
Well one of my favourite stories always was working together with the SoE translators. I used to GM on the Ubisoft servers and we had quite the interesting translations there on the german and french server.<br />
<br />
At one point rather early after the start of the EQ Europe project we realized that all - and I mean ALL - goblins in the game were called kobolds on the german and french server. When we asked the translators, why they did that they said, they didn't know how to translate the word goblin ... well ... there IS no translation to that word ... a goblin is a goblin, that goes for english, french or german.<br />
<br />
So we off course inquired: &quot;Well ... if you translated the goblins with kobolds ... what did you call the kobolds in the game?&quot; And I couldn't believe it when they told us they translated them as &quot;goblins&quot;. :eek: <br />
<br />
Actually, the Sony translators provided us with quite some fun that we in the end had to fix ... By contract we were not allowed to translate stuff ourself, but we always ended up fixing the borked translation files ... in the end they sent them to us first, we proof-read them ... and they ended up putting in the wrong ones anyway :P</div></div><hr />

 <br />
So few weeks back I saw GM in PoK by the bank. I happened to have stack of pies summoned (from the anniversary task) and I just could not resist myself! I threw a pie at GM...<br />
 <br />
Uh oh, he quickly turned to face me, smirked and before I could run off, he turned me into an imp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tejaye</div><div class="date">04-14-2009, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a EQ player starting in 1999, I am big into Nostalgia. When the game was new I recall sending a GM a tell asking him how to change gold into plat in the bank. I barely knew how to operate the game. He answered my questions, but then told me to petition next time. He was so nice.<br />
HORROR Story.......OK when Kunark was new I zoned into Skyfire from The Overthere to just escape a MOB. After I zoned in, I immediately ended up in the middle of Skyfire. There were barely any players high enough to even help back then.<br />
A GM showed up and said he can keep rezzing me, but he is not permitted to get me out of the zone since I could not prove it was a game bug. Like yeah, common sense, a level 35 Druid can make it to the middle of Skyfire alive? And why would I LOL. Well he rez'd me 9 times and I died each time as MOBs were all around. Finally after the 10th rez my gate got me out. <br />
I used to love the GM's back then though, they walked around the zones with armor nobody would ever get to see for a long time. It was exciting times.<br />
But I respected all GM's, I am sure they had a ton of work on their hands especially when the game was new. Think about how many disputes they had to settle when players fought over camps LOL.<br />
*****By the way, if you petition a GM these days, how long does it take until he/she would show up on your scene?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kitano</div><div class="date">04-15-2009, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the time they answer through petitions .. very rarely do you get one in person but if you do its within a day</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenoble</div><div class="date">04-15-2009, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several months ago my shaman handed in the wrong power source to upgrade her TSS legs.  Of course, Tenish already had the legs and until I got the right power source, I wasn't going to get them back.  Despite knowing it was my own stupidity, I petitioned.<br />
<br />
Later that evening, a GM showed up.  His surname was &quot;the Killer of Tenish&quot;; he had to kill the npc to get my legs back, but get 'em back he did.  And he came into our guild hall to give them back, then hung out for almost an hour, casting illusions on all my guildies.  So occasionally, they do stick around for some fun.</div></div><hr />
