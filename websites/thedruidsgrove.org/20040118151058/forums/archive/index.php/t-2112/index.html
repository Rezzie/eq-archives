<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Treemasteroak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for places I can solo for spectrals, I know i can do it in HOH or Tactics but having trouble doing it. Any help would be appreiciated, I'm a 65 druid with 52 AAs and a 3.8k mana pool and FT 1 and MC2 if that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>The Isaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HoH is probably the best option for you. I recommend going to the Villager or Princess Trial area and doing the Root/DoT thing. Lots of space there and you can pull singles with Harmo.<br />
<br />
Once you have more FT and a bigger mana pool you can quad kite there to speed things up a little. For reference, I have SCF3, Mana Preservation 4, FT 9, and 4900 mana. It takes basically my full mana pool to complete a quad kite with C3 using Karana's Rage. I get about 1 Spec for every 20-30 mobs I kill in HoH.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro and Tactics seem to be a little higher drop rate, but the mobs and terrain are more difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quelm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pigpen and the surrounding area in tactics worked for me.  I picked up at least 1 or 2 spectrals a day.  If you're having trouble solo, duoing with a slower makes things a whole lot easier.  A kit of mage items including casting haste, pet haste and the pet belt help speed things along, as does KEI.  Duo with another healer works as well.  Keep an eye on track and try to pull pit named mobs if you can, as they have a higher chance of dropping spectrals.</div></div><hr />
