<br />
The Black Temple<br />
<br />
      The Temple of Karabor was the center of draenei worship until its priests were slaughtered by demonically corrupted orcs. In the massacre's aftermath the warlocks of the Shadow Council seized the structure and gave it a new name: the Black Temple.<br />
<br />
      When the Alliance invaded Draenor after the Second War, the orc shaman Ner'zhul hastily opened several dimensional portals in order to escape. The resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. Drawn by these portals, the pit lord Magtheridon arrived in what had come to be known as Outland and took the temple as his seat of power.<br />
<br />
      His dominion over Outland remained unchallenged until the arrival of Illidan the Betrayer. The pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the Twin Blades of Azzinoth. Today Illidan occupies the temple, awaiting any and all who would challenge his rule. <br />
<br />
Druid Epic Flight Form Introduced<br />
<br />
      The Druid Epic flight form will be available through a series of quests, similar to the Warlock and Paladin Epic mount quests before it. This quest series will also open up a new boss in Sethekk Halls, and ultimately lead to the epic flight form. <br />
<br />
Ethereum Prison<br />
<br />
      Players in good standing with the Consortium will be tasked to deal with the most recent activities of the nefarious Ethereum. With new quests, items, and content for the solo and small-group level 70 player, the Ethereum Prison will be the proving grounds for many aspiring to greatness. <br />
<br />
Skettis<br />
<br />
      The Skyguard, Sha'tari warriors specializing in their command of the skies above Shattrath, have taken the offensive directly to the Arakkoa capital city, Skettis. Perched high in the mountains of Terrokar, and only accessible with use of a flying mount, Skettis holds new and exciting content for the solo or small-group level 70 player. All new quests, 5-person bosses, rare and epic items, and a new type of flying mount await those willing to lend their sword or stave to the battle. <br />
<br />
Nether Drake<br />
<br />
      The Netherwing faction and quest line continues and the long awaited Nether Drake becomes available. The Nether Drake is a special 280% speed epic flying mount that is obtainable through solo and small-group play. The quest to obtain one will be difficult, but the reward will surely show your dedication to the Netherwing cause as you soar through the skies of Outland on your very own ethereal drake. <br />
<br />
Ogri'la<br />
<br />
      The ogre plateau of enlightenment opens to those who prove their worth in Blade's Edge Mountains. Level 70 players will be able to help the ogres of Ogri'la battle invading forces and engage in new and exciting quests, such as a repeatable and ever popular bombing-run, this time using your own flying mount but with a dangerous twist! Featuring tons of new quests, the Ogri'la faction, 5-person bosses, and rare and epic items, Ogri'la is a place we're hoping all will aspire to enter. <br />
<br />
The Ruins of Lordaeron Arena<br />
<br />
      For those combatants engaging in the Steamwheedle Cartel's gladiatorial combat, an arena nestled within the Ruins of Lordaeron has been added to the mix of venues. Players taking part in either rated battles or skirmishes may now find themselves battling for glory within the new arena. <br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
    * The Black Temple is now available for play and Illidan awaits. Are you prepared?<br />
    * The Consortium and Protectorate need your help! Players with Honored or higher reputation with the Consortium should seek out Protectorate Advisor Rahim at the Stormspire in Netherstorm or Commander Ameer at the Protectorate Watch Post in Netherstorm to get a briefing on the most recent nefarious activities of the Ethereum.<br />
    * Skettis is now available. Players will need a flying mount to reach this new area.<br />
    * Nether Drakes are now in the game and can be gained by continuing the Netherwing faction and quest line.<br />
    * Ogri'la is now available. Level 70 players can find this new quest line in Blade's Edge Mountains.<br />
    * Glancing Blows have significantly less of a chance to occur during a player's melee attacks when targets are near the player's level.<br />
    * Magtheridon and Kael'thas now drop items that may be turned in for rewards.<br />
    * Spell Haste: The amount of spell haste rating needed per percentage of haste has been increased substantially. However, spell haste will now affect channeled spells, increasing the rate of their effects and decreasing their total duration. The same amount of damage/healing per casting will occur, but will take less time.<br />
    * Chance to break crowd control from damage: The increased chance for a spell to break from taking a critical strike has been removed. Instead, all targets over level 60 have a slightly larger chance to break out of crowd-controlling effects when they take damage.<br />
    * Screenshots captured using the Print Screen key are now saved in JPG format.<br />
    * Inspect distance has been increased to 30 yards (from 10 yards).<br />
    * The amount of parry rating needed to get 1% parry has been reduced by 25%.<br />
    * Many set bonuses did not work properly when combined with an item or enchantment that had the exact same effect at the exact same magnitude. That issue has been corrected on all set bonuses.<br />
    * Taunts: The taunt system has been adjusted so that Warrior Taunt, Druid Growl, and Paladin Righteous Defense will now grant the player the correct amount of threat even when the creature or its target is crowd controlled.<br />
    * Dodge Rating: Low level players now calculate dodge from dodge rating at the same rate as level 34 players.<br />
    * The negative effect of the orc racial ability Blood Fury no longer stacks with other effects that reduce healing (Mortal Strike, Wounding Poison, etc.)<br />
    * Characters can now speak with Orphan Matron Mercy in Shattrath City during Children's Week to mentor a draenei (Alliance) or blood elf (Horde) orphan. Shattrath orphans have a whole new line of sight-seeing requests across both Outland and Azeroth and three new pets to offer to their mentors. <br />
<br />

    * Battlegrounds<br />
          o The new battleground matchmaking system is now implemented and active. This system allows the battleground to select teams of similar equipment quality and organizational level to battle each other. For now, the system will be very forgiving about creating matchups in order to keep queue times low. However, the parameters will be adjusted as necessary when more organized teams become active in the battlegrounds. <br />
<br />
Druids<br />
<br />
    * The Druid Epic Flight Form is now available through a series of quests.<br />
    * Barkskin now reduces all damage taken, with its duration reduced to 12 seconds and cooldown reduced to 1 minute.

    * Cyclone: This ability will no longer work on hunters with The Beast Within active or hunter pets with Bestial Wrath active.<br />

    * Force of Nature: These pets will now come into the game with full health, including that gained from a percentage of their master's stamina.<br />

    * Subtlety(Restoration Talent) now applies to all spells, not just healing spells.<br />

    * Teleport: Moonglade: This spell is no longer castable in Tree of Life Form.<br />
    * Tree of Life Form: The tooltip has been corrected to indicate Nature's Swiftness and Rebirth are castable in this form. <br />
<br />
Hunters<br />
<br />
    * A new Avoidance ability can now be taught to hunter pets. This effect reduces the chance of being hit by area of effect spells and abilities by 25% or 50% (by rank).<br />
    * A new Cobra Reflexes ability can now be taught to hunter pets. This effect increases attack speed but reduces damage.<br />
    * Arcane Shot: Casting lower ranks of Arcane Shot than your maximum rank will now reduce the bonus you receive from attack power.<br />
    * Arcane Shot: The tooltips for this ability in 2.0.12 were incorrect and have been fixed in 2.1.0. The damage dealt by maximum rank Arcane Shot is unchanged from 2.0.12 to 2.1.0; only the tooltip is changed.<br />
