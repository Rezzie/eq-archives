Havn't checked your armory yet, but one thing is to make a macro to mark skull, if  people are attacking your primary dps target they will never pulls aggro off you.<br />
<br />
my rotation when i raid, is <br />
single target lacerate/maul, Mangle , L/M , FFF, L/M , Mangle and so on.<br />
<br />
 when i am pulling a boss FFF then mangle then i start the rotation.<br />
<br />
Groups i just maul/swipe and mangle when it's up.<br />
<br />
<br />
FYI skull raid target macro is awesome for quick skulling your next/current target. Maul glyph also will keep them pulling off an extra mob too quick but if they aren't focusing on &quot;skull target&quot; then they fail at dps.<br />
<br />
Edit: I looked at your armory. What is your Crit/dodge/hp/armor with just MOTW up ( keep thorns on yourself it helps also)<br />
<br />
I have quite a few sites for gear listings also rawr will help too , it will show your raid stats. fully buffed. Let me know if you need links to the sites.<br />
<br />
check out my armory for either of my druids, compare talents,glyphs.<br />
<br />
Hope atleast some of this helped, let me know if you need anything, one of us here will be sure to try and help you.<br />
<br />
:<br />
Edit:Edit:<br />
<br />
Do not gem for defense.<br />
<br />
Agility stamina are your stats you need. <br />
<br />
My bear stats on my horde druid with just MOTW is 30kish hp and 38%dodge 33%crit and i forget armor.<br />
<br />
Also gett he Autere earthsiege. Stamina-/armor increase meta.<br />
<br />
Try to get staff of trickery to start you off if you dont plan on raiding, Enchant for tanking is mongoose mongoose mongoose, it stays up All the time for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah yes.  Good catch, Talon.  Canid, bears no longer need defense at all if you're 3/3 Survival of the Fittest.<br />
<br />
Strength is an &quot;ok&quot; stat for bears...but I think you'd be better off trying to replace it with Agi.  You get more dodge from Agility, more crit (yumyum!).  I don't think Strength is as much of an awesomesauce bear stat as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Your spec looks ok.  Do you PvP alot?<br />
<br />
I noticed you have a point in Nurturing Instinct which really doesn't do anything for a bear at all =( <br />
<br />
Here's My Armory (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Durotan&amp;n=Destinae), just click on Feral Combat (since right now I'm dual spec, and I was healing when I last logged in).<br />
<br />
I don't have too much trouble with threat unless I'm with DPS that can't follow target order or just far outgears me.  <br />
<br />
The Enraged Feral Staff from H: UK (I believe is where it drops) is usually what I use for tanking, even in Naxx 10.  <br />
<br />
Let's see...I have King of the Jungle 3/3 which increases my damage when I use enrage (and I find myself rage starved a lot, so it helps me a bit)...I usually enrage before I pull, then FFF...then it's a swipe/maul fest.  <br />
<br />
Bear tanking has changed a bit.  Try grabbing the Glyph of Maul.  A BIG chunk of bear threat (for now) comes from Maul. <br />
<br />
What is your group makeup where you're having trouble holding aggro?  Is it mostly in groups that have big AoE's?  Like Mages and such?<br />
<br />
If that's the case, you just have to make sure they understand that they can't open up with a full-power nuke-fest before you've had a chance to get a decent amount of threat built up.<br />
<br />
If it's just that they're playing cute DPS on something that isn't your main target- then you just have to try marking- and don't be afraid to growl at someone who's not following the order.  <br />
<br />
Do you lose threat on bosses or single targets?  Or is it only trash pulls of 2 or more?<br />
<br />
*Edit*  Btw- I &lt;3 your thread title hehe</div></div><hr />

For more threat if he has plenty of avoidance he could always get the threat idol from the grizzly hills venture company pvp quests, only takes like 3-4 quests to get it. Terror and that one is the only ones i use.</div></div><hr />

Here's what I'm carrying into battle talent-wise:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#0ZxGrscrzseRcczAkbE0z:bo00Vz<br />
I have that point into nurturing instinct for quicker healing time (for myself) in pvp, and imho just makes life alittle easier overall.<br />

<br />
The macro might help.  I guess I'm a grumpy bear.  If folks are doing stuff wrong or attacking the wrong target and pulling aggro...usually I'll try to gently correct the problem...then the second time is a bit of a harsher warning...after that...I just let them eat it and then pick the thing up before it goes off to pound on the healer.  Repair bills help folks learn really quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Understandable, but  now that i look at it, your not glyphed for maul, which helps, it really does for tanking. ( i might end up changing out SI for Growl) But neways.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thing is when u hybridize, you only do one job half as good and the other job half as good, since WOTLK.<br />
We've had to specialize even more into either <br />
Feral Tank<br />
Feral DPS<br />
Feral PVP<br />
Boomkin PVE<br />
Boomkin PVP<br />
Resto PVE<br />
Resto PVP<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See where i am going here?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep doing dailies get 1kg up , get dual spec, then pvp with one how ever you want,  and tank if that is what you want to do with the other.<br />
It won't take long to get enough gold up to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">06-10-2009, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol Canid- by warnings I mean...&quot;Please follow target order only.  Makes it easier on the healer and myself&quot;  Then I post the target order again.<br />
<br />
The second warning is usually, &quot;You pull it, you're tanking it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not the most amazingly geared tank, but rarely do I have problems holding threat.  I held my own against a fully Ulduar geared boomkin in H:UK last night.  Only lost a mob once or twice, and it was just the DPS focusing on the wrong target or AoEing too early.<br />
<br />
Maul seems to = oodles of threat, in which case I would recommend the Glyph of Maul if you haven't grabbed that yet. Let's you hit 1 extra mob with maul, and that's one less mob you have to worry about.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes if I know I'm with a DPS that just doesn't get it, I'll FFF the secondary target to pull, and then switch back to Skull and start swiping.  <br />
<br />
I think you're best bet though, is to communicate with your group.  All of us tanking classes have our strengths and weaknesses.  It took me awhile, and a lot of grumpy bear runs with some guildies to get them to understand how bears tank, but it was worth it.  Now, if there's a big pull (3 or more) they let me swipe usually 3 or more times before they start nuking mobs.  By then it really doesn't matter which target they're on.  Seems to help if I'm with a PuG too, to just explain that I need a few swipes before they can go total nukefest on the baddies.  They usually are willing to give me a little head start on threat building because it = less repair bills for them. =)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  <br />
<br />
As far as the hybrid build thing- I'd have to agree a little with Talon.  With the way the talent trees are set up- it really sort of forces you into a &quot;feral specialization&quot; where you're either a bear or a kitty, pvp or pve...the good ole days of being able to do it all seem to have come to a close =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll be picking up the maul glyph.  I guess I didn't realize it was that much threat.  :bonk: <br />

I'm gonna have to try that...hell, once I login, I'm gonna make a macro stating that...or similar.<br />

Losing threat and DPS deaths doesn't make for a fun tanking experience...(not to mention making the healer miserable as well)...but the longer I tank in end game, the more apt I am to let the DPS know how I &quot;really&quot; feel.  hehe<br />
<br />
I've run with this shaman a few times and I never do remember why the name sounds familiar until after the first pull or two.  Then the light bulb clicks on...&quot;Oh, right...he's the one who likes to pull instead of letting me handle it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eh, got stuck with him last night again.  So, I let him pull.  The group left him on his own.  He died.  We assumed he learned.  We move on to another trash pull and he hits chain lightning before I even had a chance to FFF anything.  He died again.  /shrug.  I wasn't about to save him from himself.  Impatience causes wipes just as much as stupidity.  Hopefully he learned, but I wouldn't wager on it.</div></div><hr />
