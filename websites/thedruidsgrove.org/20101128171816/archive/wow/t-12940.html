So, this is a minor change.<br />
<br />
And I think Survival Instincts has been taking off the GCD.  That is a really nice buff.  As it allows you to make this nice bear emergency macro...<br />

I would go FR only because I have made barkskin a regular part of my tanking rotation, and I went from Kara off tank to T5 main tank with very few gear upgrades...20% reduction of all incomng damage is huge!  Hug a healer and cast Barkskin early and often!  :)<br />
<br />
Also, I would just use the Potion since you may not always have health stones but if you do the combo of all those things is gonna result in some waisted HP buffs you may need later.  Just my trinkets + SI + FR will normally get me ~50%-75% health then you have incoming heals too. <br />
<br />
Plus you have to add a fun raid warning to the macro...<br />

<br />
I would not bind it with FFF only because I think you lose 3-4 secs of damage reduction while your are positioning the mobs (LOS or whatever)  The reduction is only 12 secs so I like to hold off popping it until I am taking a beating.<br />
<br />
I reccomend macro'ing it with swipe.  The logic being with the maul glyph (every bear should have), you are only using swipe when you are trying to hold 3+ targets.  With 3+ targets beating on you, your healer's got their work cut out for them! (one warning, it does eat up a GCD, so when you are need to hit many targets fast, this could be bad)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, press button once on pull for FFF and next time I press it will cast barkskin.  I'd use a macro like this...<br />
<br />
/castsequence [stance:1] reset=5/target FFF, barkskin<br />
<br />
I haven't tried this yet, so I'm not sure how practical it will be while playing.  This probably won't work so well as FFF is now part of a good tanking rotation since it causes fair amount of threat.  Which means I mash FFF whenever I don't have rage to do anything else.<br />
<br />
I do something similar with my cat version of FFF now that Rake has been buff'd so much.  This is great while attacking quest mobs....<br />
<br />
/castsequence [stance:3] reset=10/target FFF, Rake<br />
<br />
So when I pull a mob in cat form, I just mash that button twice, then mangle....FB.</div></div><hr />
