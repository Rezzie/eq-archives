She picked up http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19724#dropped-by (along with one other of the set).<br />

But you must be revered with some faction to do it.</div></div><hr />

Although I should at least check the STV guy out, except now that I'm finally in OL I kind of wanna just charge forward and never turn back.....:shuffle:</div></div><hr />

There's a tiny little island off the Western coast of STV.  It's almost directly west of Nesingwarys camp.<br />

You probably don't want to bother with getting the necessary rep, the items there were designed to get you ready for MC ( sans the necessary fire resist ) and shadow priests weren't really all that raid viable prior to BC.  You'd end up with a pair of healy shoulders that are probably replaced in Zangramarsh LOL http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19841</div></div><hr />

Keep the item as a trophy if you want, but I wouldn't think too much about trying to turn it in.</div></div><hr />

Go have fun in HFP :)</div></div><hr />

The mats are a bit much, but it last through death, and it's still the best oils in the game, though that may change after the expansion. <br />
