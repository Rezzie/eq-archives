<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-20-2009, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after 3.5 years, I think I'm finally gonna stop playing this game (I actually haven't played in 2-3 weeks, except to check that gatherer issue for Khel).  I have just sort of lost interest.  My account is paid up thru 9/13, so I might log in, but not likely.<br />
<br />
There are a few pointers I'd give to new players...<br />
<br />
<br />
 Play a Druid.  I started with hunter (based on a suggestion from my brother) back in the fall of '05, but I wish I had been a Druid from day 1.  With dual-specs, etc.  It is really stupid to play anything other than a Druid and/or Pally.  Never play a pure DPS class.<br />
 Take herbalism while leveling....you can do it in form and the stupid flowers are everywhere and you don't even have to look for them.  Free gold.<br />
 Consider skinning while leveling.  You can skin in forms and it is free gold while leveling.  Swap it for something else later, if you want, though I wouldn't.<br />
 Don't take inscription.  That alone may have been a leading cause to me leaving the game.  Seriously.  It was a huge money sink and, for me, without money (I didn't do a single daily in LK) I always felt like I was cheating everyone I played with.  And it led to quite a bit of frustration.  I'm sure I'd easily have 8.5-10K gold now if it wasn't for inscription.  And I still don't have it max'd out!<br />
 Quest Helper! (with Tom Tom)<br />
 Auctioneer is nice.  Put it on a banker alt, run the alt to the nearest AH.  Have him scan the AH every couple of days.  Send everything you want to sell (herbs, skins, etc.) to him.<br />
 Don't let folks convince you that 5-mans are stupid, boring and something that only noobs run.  They are, IMO, the best part of the game.  Too bad they watered them down so much in LK.  Though an occasional 10-man is fun as well.  25-man sucks.  Too many afks, players swaps and other excessive down-time sinks.  Ugh!<br />
<br />
<br />
Have fun...</div></div><hr />

I wish you all the best, and hope that you'll stop in from time to time to say hi. *hug*<br />

<br />
cheers for checking on the gatherer issues tlb :)   i downloaded the db for it from wowhead earlier and need to import it now.<br />
<br />
sorry to hear u have lost interest although i did take 6 months off following quitting raiding and moving server.<br />
<br />
enjoy now though even though i cant raid. love the social side of it and happy to run 5 mans etc even though it means i have a million and 1 EoH's !</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish you the best in RL and gaming, whatever you should choose to do!</div></div><hr />

<br />
your understanding of game mechanics will definitely be missed...<br />
<br />
you MAY be leaving the game a LITTLE early, as when 3.2 ships, 5 mans will definitely be more &quot;in demand&quot; as they will drop Emblems of Conquest, but if you're burned out, then you're burned out. GL man!</div></div><hr />
