I played EQ1 from 1999 thru Nov 2006. I played a Druid most of the time. I then tried WoW and have been hooked on the PvP Battlegrounds.<br />
WoW is nice, I will never go back to EQ, but my heart will always be with EQ1 It is such a Classic, that regardless of its faults, no game can beat EQ. So......any drastic changes made to EQ since Nov 2006? New races/classes/levels etc?<br />
Any big changes to the content for the under level 60 crowd?<br />
An upcoming WoW expansion will have a new class which i think is similiar to a Shadowknight. I recall how powerful a SK was, so that will be nice :)</div></div><hr />

New gimmicks, same old stuff that makes EQ, EQ.  If you're not missing classic EQ you're not missing anything that's come out in the last 2 years.<br />
 <br />
I'm playing both games actually.  I just about only raid in EQ anymore and do everything BUT raid in WoW.  I abhor WoW raid dynamics.  Seems most of the raid events I've seen or done involve getting better at regaining control of your character after getting a) feared b) stunned c) charmed d) all three.  I tried it for a while and it did nothing but grate on my nerves.  I call WoW the Wal-Mart of raiding; seems Blizzard equates challenge to cheap dynamics.<br />
 <br />
I enjoy PVP but mostly via twinks.  Maintaining high level characters when new content is constantly released, while I'm not saying is a bad thing, but it does take a serious investment of time.  I have 2 toons at the high end (feral druid and hunter) but I do the bare minimum to keep them relevant in arena (my ratings are in the mid-1500s).</div></div><hr />

I recall back in 1999 when reaching level 50 seemed years away. EQ surely has grown in certain ways.<br />
But it does seem that most of us WoW folks, who left EQ behind entirely, miss the Nostalgia of it. Former EQ players miss it a lot. We miss the community aspect of EQ that WoW could never have. It seems in WoW folks like to solo in general hunting since they lvl up quicker. In EQ folks always welcomed groups.<br />
People in WoW jump from one guild to another several times a week. In EQ you stayed in one guild for years.<br />
In WoW I mainly just do BG's as a twink. I find that to be the most fun.<br />
EQ is a Classic that will never be beat, but the EQ from years ago that I loved and cherished seems to be gone. I didn't have time for raiding and it seems that is all that is left in EQ.<br />
But nothing will ever beat EQ, how it was in 1999 thru around 2003.<br />
Those were Classic times :)<br />
I also play a Feral Druid in WoW, but I always missed the fact that I wasn't a Ranger in EQ, so I play a Hunter also  now in WoW and love it. The tracking aspect and just the class in general seems close to the ways of the Druid, which I loved so deeply in EQ.</div></div><hr />
