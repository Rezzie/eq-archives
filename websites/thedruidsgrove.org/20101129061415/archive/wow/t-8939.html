<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uvgrin</div><div class="date">06-05-2005, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats, I'm currently lvl 30 and I roughly have 1,150HP's probably more I've slowly been getting better at pvp. I don't get a chance to 1v1 very much i'ts normally group vs group. So trying to take someone down, I've learned most casters run in and melee them. Melee classes, I normally hit them with a few moonfires then go into bearform. The times I try to root them it normally last about 2 seconds, I've stopped trying. Now here is the problem, casters haven't been so bad, but it seems like most of the time I try to take on a melee class they take me down FAST. <br />
Good example, a rogue was running out of astraanar he hit the water so I spammed some moonfires on him jumped in the water caught up to him I still had about half my mana left, he had less then 1/4 his hp's he charged me took my 1,200 hp's down within seconds(he was never behind me). <br />
Am I just having bad luck, doing somethign really wrong, or is that just the way it is?</div></div><hr />

Also, rogues own cloth/leather.  If you want to fight a rogue in melee, you need to be in bear form.  As for root, it varies but is subject to diminishing returns.  One thing I have found is extremely useful vs rogues is to faerie fire them as soon as possible.  I will even FF them before moonfire.  Then I follow it with a moonfire and bear, if I have time, otherwise just bear.  I beat on them a little and they beat on me.  Then, I bash and come up for a heal.<br />
<br />
Take heart, for me at least, dueling melee's became easier as I got higher in levels with 40-50 probably being the best time for me.  Mainly because their weapons hadn't reached epic levels yet and I had 4100 AC at level 40 in Dire Bear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">06-06-2005, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also remember, moonfire breaks root. A lot of people will root and drop a starfire followed by moonfire spam and wonder why root doesn't last, but the arcane damage will break the root. if you root them without the moonfire, and spam wrath the root will stick. Also make sure your not wearing any cloth &gt;&lt; I've sen lots of resto/balance druids wearing cloth, it really hurts your bearform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uvgrin</div><div class="date">06-08-2005, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand about damage breaking root, including the damage done by the root itself. I actually don't root a whole lot, but it was just frusterating since it seems like whenever I do it last 2 seconds.<br />
Also I figured out part of the reason why I was getting owned so fast. It is displaying the level wrong somehow. It will tell me the characters level is lets say 25 but the guy is actually lvl 40. Does anyone else have this problem?<br />
My armour is about par, I am wearing mostly all leather(except for cloak and hat which aren't available at least yet). Almost all of it is what I made, which is better then most what I've seen for sale or that drops from my level monsters. I currently put alot of emphasis in sta gear, like so many have said all the mana in the world won't save you if you have no HP's.<br />
On a side note it seems kind of sad almost all of the time it seems useless using any other spell other then moonfire. Sometimes I'll try to give myself the big heal. Although I must say while spamming moonfire isn't mana efficient, it is pretty usefull. I've helped finish a runner by spamming them with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrax</div><div class="date">06-09-2005, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finishing a runner with moonfire is one thing, but using it as your primary PvP tool is another.  Right now you are in a difficult period (at least it was for me) where you actually get weaker as you approach 40.  However, once you hit 40 and get dire bear form, you will notice a HUGE spike in survivability.<br />
<br />
The thing about druids is that we don't kill fast, we just plain outlast our opponent.  Grind them down a little at a time until they are dead.  That is why if your computer is displaying levels incorrectly, you will get owned.  It is hard to grind down someone who can take off 1/3 of your life in one hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the other thing I didn't mention, is rogues are absolute monsters in the 30's compaired to everyone else. when my rogue hit 30 I was beating people down left and right, it wasn't until I got into my mid 40's that the playing field really started to level out for my rogue and people wheren't quite so easy to handle anymore. I also found I had a hard time with rogues till I got direbear form. Just yesterday I was trying to ding 54 off of some turtles when a 55 rogue jumped me, I sprinted off in cat till I had distance to heal, droped into bear and tanked him out. He couldn't restealth because of farie fire, and when he used his evasion I just rooted him and waited for it to wear off(that had to drive him nuts) what I'm getting at is, there is no way I could have handled that fight like that if I where in my 30's vs. a rogue of the same level. they just do too much burst damage for our armor to deal with on top of kick, gouge, kidney shot, and cheap shot, all skills that interupt spellcasting &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">06-10-2005, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at lvl 60, i think rogues are my favorite class to fight because we are capable of countering them, but they are still a challenge if you slip up.  a typical rogue battle for me begins with: cheap shot (followed by me cursing), my pvp trinket, nature's grasp rooting them, moonfire, faerie fire (hopefully before they vanish out of roots), i shift into bear, fight for a bit, bash, shift out and heal to full, root them, moonfire again, wrath wrath wrath, spam moonfire after another root or shift back into bear ftw.  with combat health/mana pots, i even have an extra cushion for if/when things go wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tank them to death.  Root, heal, farie fire, bear, win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">half the time rogues try to run from me, it's like free HK when they do. Farie fire negates any stealth, cat form has can dash when they sprint, and when it wears off I run faster than them.<br />
They use evasion and I just root them till it wears off. Rogues high end are my favorite class to pvp vs. but around lvl 30 it was absolute murder trying to deal with em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">06-13-2005, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good mages have insane DPS. My guilds ubermage crits me for 2000 sometimes. You have one NS and use your feral charge as often as you can. If you play it right he will be oom WAY before you are. After that you can just bear him for the win. As said, don't use moonfire as an offensive, it's a crappy nuke if you compare to the mages arsenal. Use your mana to heal yourself instead. Don't forget the trick with heartstone. ;)<br />
<br />
Rogues otoh are tricky. Start in bear or try to uberstealth him if you're good at it. Sometimes they get going and you have no chance, but mostly your bear and heals will surely outlast him. Fairy fire is not a must really.. keep him DoTed works also.<br />
<br />
Im not that uber at PvP but thats what I can tell ya. GL :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh BTW.. if your fighting casters.. don't stand still and punch em.. run around them i random patterns so they loose youre target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaebler</div><div class="date">07-08-2005, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does runnng around actually cause them to LOSE you as target?  I figured that the only thing that would help was the initial targeting, but once they had you u were tagged and that was it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kabaoum</div><div class="date">07-10-2005, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">only if they are clicking everywhere on the screen in desperation :D the only thing I've found that causes you to lose target is fear and poly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">07-12-2005, 09:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I meant they lose you as they cast the spell. You know you have to be infront of them otherwise they get the error message &quot;target must be infront of you&quot; - and the spell cancles. (My english lacks sometimes)<br />
<br />
Works. really. :)</div></div><hr />
