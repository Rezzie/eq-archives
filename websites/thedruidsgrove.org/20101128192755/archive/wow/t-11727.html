I really like to heal when I am in groups and tank if I have to.  What equipment should I be trying to get?  That is, what qualities should I be trying to enhance?  Strength?  Intelligence?  Spirit?<br />
When alone, I am mostly feral and transform to heal.  Would it help me down the road to respecialize?<br />

<br />
For your feral (kitty) set you will be looking for the following: (based on priority)<br />
Strength - This will give you raw AP. Cat form gets 2 AP per Strength (2.4 w/ HotW and 2.47(or something like that) with SotF+HotW)<br />
Agility - 1 Agility will give you 1 AP plus crit and dodge.<br />
Stamina - You won't do any damage if you're dead...keep a decent amount of stam.<br />
<br />
as for other gear qualities look for crit rating and hit rating. (For your hit rating, you want to have it at around 5% (mouseover for %)).<br />
<br />
For your healing set you will be looking for the following: based on priority as well::<br />
Intellect - You want to have a nice mana pool...and an even bigger one if you aren't resto spec'ed because your heals are much less efficient.<br />
Bonus Healing - It lets you be able to downgrade to more mana efficient heals with large amounts of this (althugh this was nerfed so don't downgrade too much because it doesn't get 100% of the bonus..think it has to be 3sec cast and higher to get 100%...not sure)<br />
Spirit // mana/5sec  - Spirit lets you regen mana at a quicker rate during combat and for long fights is VERY helpful.<br />
<br />
<br />
For your healing set don't feel scared to put on some cloth...if you're with a good tank you shouldn't be getting hit anyways...Plus healing gear from 1-55ish isn't too great for leather.</div></div><hr />

I have a lot of bonus healing gear already because of some generous friends.  I also have a lot of +stamina, +strength, and +agility gear.  Your advice will help.  Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the way I leveled (my first toon and I got to 60 with a /played of 8days 16hours and something =/) but I did miss out on much of the higher level instances past ZF.<br />
<br />
Technically skipping instances is much faster as long as you are diligent and keep a good xp/hour but you lose out on the fun of WoW.<br />
<br />
So it's up to you. But instance running is fun break from grinding/questing imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you don't have quests and you can get a high level to run you through then in most cases this isn't worth it because you won't get enough XP. I've never worried about collecting drops though because in the end, only the end game gear is worth keeping and you will find pretty much all you need in quest rewards and from drops. If you don't the AH has an seemingly endless supply of greens at a reasonable price ;)</div></div><hr />

If this is your first character you're leveling (or even first druid) get some instancing experience under your belt.  Learning how your druid can fit into a group and just how you can function will make your life much easier in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True.  Unless you are an enchanter, then all the gear that you no longer use turns into shards, essences or dust that you can use to make your new gear better :)  Or sell for a good amount on the AH.<br />
<br />
And great call on learning to play in groups Rele.  I can always tell the druids at 70 who just solo'd or power lvl'd and have no idea how to play their class.  Instancing, both healing dps'ing and tanking is necessary to fully understand the druid class.</div></div><hr />
