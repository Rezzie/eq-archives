<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">06-07-2007, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two or three weeks back I got my t4 leggings, replacing clefthoof. The def was easy to make-up. However, I just got my t4 chestpiece, and I'm really not sure how to maintain being uncrittable.<br />
<br />
Several options that I can see:<br />
+Resilience enchant<br />
+Def/Stam Gems, which would lower my stamina (Clefthoof had +6 all stats and 3x +12 Stam gems)<br />
Marshal's Leather Bracers, and put a +12 stam gem in... Though, I'd still be a bit short, I think.<br />
<br />
There's a handful of other crazy ones, but meh. Anyway, I logged out in my tanking set and left the t4 chest (unsocketed/enchanted)  on. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
(...and we just started SSC [late, yeah &gt;&lt;], and I'm going to go out of my mind if the Wildfury Greatstaff drops. Ugh.)<br />
<br />
Edit: Armory is in my signature. Or here (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Aerie+Peak&amp;n=Avylalith).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cloak is nice but the one from Illhoof is extremely close, but also has defense rating http://www.thottbot.com/i28660.<br />
<br />
Can also replace Alchemist's Stone with something like the Adamantite Figurine, much as I would hate to use that, it gets the job done. Not particularly a fan of the Stone anyway, mine's in the bank...going to use Pocket Watch and the Badge(Once I get the badge QQ!).<br />
<br />
At any rate the Illhoof cloak should be enough to put you over the top, and you'd lose 5 armor and 6 stamina, so nothing really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I figured I could use adamantium figurine (have it in the bank), and then be crafty to keep my health up.<br />
<br />
Also: I lucked out on the badge. Priest logged on, and ten minutes later he linked it in guild chat, having found it on a mob. Gave it to me for free. ^^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veriden</div><div class="date">06-07-2007, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, I think I figured it out...<br />
<br />
Changes:<br />
Alchemist's Stone --&gt; Adamantium Figurine<br />
Forestheart Bracers --&gt; Marshal's Leather Bracers<br />
--Change +12 Def rating to +12 Stam<br />
--Add a +12 Stam gem<br />
Heavy Clefthoof Chest --&gt; T4 Chest<br />
--Same enchants/gems<br />
Cowl of Beastly Rage<br />
--Switch +4 def/+6 Stam to +12 stam<br />
<br />
Doing this, I should get about... 1% Dodge, 600-700 Armor, 100 Health. Works for me. Now all I need is T4 Helm, Illhoof's Cloak, and Wildfury Greatstaff (at which point I'd probably swap some gems for +4 Agi/+6 Stam).<br />
<br />
So, that's my solution. But if anyone has a better one, let me know :x Thanks for the idea with the Figurine!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm having the same issues with the heroic tanking drops unfortuantely...mostly the Tree-Mender's Belt, have done about 10 runs just since the patch and crap every time.<br />
<br />
I lucked out on the cloak, but I'm sure it'll take 8,000 Illhoof kills for the staff, since I desperately need a better dps weapon(using earthwarden :cry: ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Changed my mind:<br />
<br />
Only swapping bracers to the PvP ones and the chest to the t4. I'll start lugging around stacks of Ironskin potions (and I think the Greater Agility potions) to maintain uncrittability. I think this works...<br />
<br />
And at Ketch:<br />
<br />
Owch, that sucks. :x I'm rather lucky, to be honest. Stuff usually drops on my first or second run (heroic or raid), except for a few items (read: Illhoof's staff/cloak, Moroes' pocketwatch, and t4 helm). &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Good luck getting your heroic drops, though! Forestwalker Kilt, Tree-mender Girdle, and Forestheart bracers are very nice. Barkchip boots are ok too, if you don't have Zierhut.</div></div><hr />
