It's looking like that may very well be the case:  McCain: At Wednesday's Debate I Plan To Bring Up Ayers (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/14/mccain-at-wednesdays-deba_n_134506.html?aaa)</div></div><hr />

Great, one candidate may well end up having a heart attack before he can even be elected while the other stands a real chance of being assassinated by the foaming-at-the-mouth fanatical followers of the other candidate.<br />

None of their effort during the debate was for those of us who have been with them since the beginning. At this point, they only care about the small chunk of undecided voters in swing states. That means a handful of people in Ohio who have managed to avoid noticing that Obama and McCain disagree on virtually every important issue facing the nation and continue to insist that they are torn between them.<br />
<br />
Plus, of course, a couple of folks who got picked for a long-running television panel of undecided voters and don&#8217;t want to admit they&#8217;ve made up their minds because they&#8217;ll get thrown out.<br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons why the last few weeks of a presidential campaign tend to be so awful. The candidates are gearing their remarks to people who have managed to completely ignore nearly two years of news about the 2008 elections. In the end, it&#8217;s always all about the ones who play hard to get. <br />

Which is why I think it is so important to have a system of proportional representation and why district systems are pretty much always producing worse results.<br />

According to Crooks and Liars (http://crooksandliars.com/david-neiwert/joe-plumber-more-joe-keating-family-) he's a partisan Republican who also happens to be a member of McCain's old friends, the Keating family.</div></div><hr />

Rather clever actually.</div></div><hr />

Truth be told, I really don't care about any of these peripheral &quot;issues&quot; for either candidate/running mate.  In fact, while Obama's general platform and beliefs more closely overlap my own, the primary reason I'd vote for him is that he is clearly a more intelligent and deliberative person than McCain.  I am confident that he will pick first rate people for his administration and that he has the leadership skills to get them all working together.  If he runs the country as he has run is campaign, we'll be in good hands.  McCain, on the other hand, has run a lousy campaign, he's willing to compromise his principles when convenient, he makes important decisions recklessly (Palin!!!), and can't seem to put together and stick to a coherent strategy.  I also get the feeling that he is letting his campaign run him rather than the other way around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-18-2008, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I totally agree.  I just watched the FrontLine about Obama and McCain and how poorly McCain run (or let his) campaign be run, in the primary, such that he almost had to drop out.  Seems like pretty poor executive skills.<br />
<br />
I think Obama is right on when he says that McCain is erratic.  He is!  <br />
<br />
And notice how they use Palin as the attack dog.  No one will attack her back because she's a woman and that would be viewed as sexist or worse.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the Republicans have quite figured out what sexism is yet.  If they had, they'd have realized that viewing any/all attacks on Palin as sexist is, well, sexist.</div></div><hr />
