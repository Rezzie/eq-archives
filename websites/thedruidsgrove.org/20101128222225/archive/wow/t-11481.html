http://www.worldofraids.com/v2/img/news/BC/druid/druid-talents-spells.txt<br />
<br />
Total spell damage bonus is now displayed in the UI.<br />
Frenzied Regeneration now scales with stamina. For Rank 3, each point of rage is now converted to 17 health plus some percentage of your stamina (looks like 1%).<br />
Moonfury's tooltip now reads increases damage to all Balance damage spells, which means it probably is now applied after bonus spell damage effects.<br />
Travel Form model has been changed to a stag.<br />
No word about Stormcrow Form, but I wouldn't rule it out as a level 70 flying mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
Balance Talents<br />
<br />
Tier 5<br />
Gusting Winds: Increases the damage done by your Cyclone and Hurricane spells by 10/20/30%.<br />
<br />
Tier 6<br />
Dreamstate: Gives you a 33/66/100% chance to gain the Focused Casting effect that lasts for 6 sec after being the victim of a melee or ranged critical strike. The Focused Casting effect prevents you from losing casting time when taking damage.<br />
<br />
Tier 7<br />
Improved Moonkin Form: Requires 1 point in Moonkin Form. Increases all spell damage caused by 1/2/3% and reduces the base mana cost of Moonkin Form by 5/10/15%. Note: This means Moonkin now costs as much as Travel and Aquatic Forms.<br />
Strength of the Moon: Increases spell damage by up to 5/10/15/20/25% of your total intellect.<br />
<br />
Tier 8<br />
Empowered Starfire: Your Starfire spell gains an additional 2/4/6/8/10% of your bonus spell damage effects.<br />
<br />
Tier 9<br />
Force of Nature (Rank 1): The force of nature radiates from the Druid, silencing enemies within 10 yards for 2 sec. and causing 192-212 Nature damage. Note: 2 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral Combat Talents<br />
<br />
Tier 5<br />
Feral Recovery: All healing effects on you are increased by 10/20%. In addition, the act of shapeshifting has a 25/50% chance to remove one harmful effect.<br />
<br />
Tier 6<br />
Primal Instinct: Increases your chance to resist stun, charm, and trap effects by 3/6/9/12/15%.<br />
<br />
Tier 7<br />
Animal Reflexes: Increases your agility by 2/4/6/8/10% while in Cat, Bear, and Dire Bear forms.<br />
Predatory Will: Reduces the cooldown of Growl and increases the duration of Tigers Fury by 1/2 sec.<br />
<br />
Tier 8<br />
Heightened Senses: Increases your attack power by up to 10/20/30/40/50% of your intellect.<br />
<br />
Tier 9<br />
Scent of the Pack: Reduces damage taken in Bear Form and Dire Bear Form by 0.4%, and increases damage done in Cat Form by 0.6% for every party or raid member within 45 yards with Mark of the Wild or Gift of the Wild active. So 10% less dmg taken in bear and 15% more damage done in catform in a 25 man raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
<br />
Tier 6<br />
Natural Resilience: Increases your mana regeneration while in all forms by 10/20/30%.<br />
<br />
Tier 7<br />
Healing Mastery: Increases the critical effect chance of your healing spells by 1/2/3/4/5%.<br />
Improved Innervate: Reduces the cooldown of Innervate by 20/40/60 sec.<br />
<br />
Tier 8<br />
Nature's Reprieve: Gives you a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to gain Mana equal to the base cost of your spell after healing a wounded target with Healing Touch, Regrowth, or Swiftmend.<br />
<br />
Tier 9<br />
Harmonize: Distributes damage taken by party members within 30 yards between the party while in effect. Note: Its a self cast buff that lasts up to 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
New Base Spells<br />
<br />
Cyclone (Balance): Throws your target into the air, disorienting the target and causing Nature damage over 3 seconds but making the target immune to other damage during that time.<br />
Mangle (Cat Form): Stuns the enemy and deals damage per combo point.<br />
Feral Strike (Bear Form): An attack that deals damage and converts each extra point of rage into damage and causes a high amount of threat.<br />
Enervate (Restoration): Drains mana, energy, or rage every second for 20 seconds.<br />
