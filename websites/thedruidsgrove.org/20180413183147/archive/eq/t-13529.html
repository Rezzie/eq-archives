Quests should start in Jaggeredpine or Surefall. BTW the tunic quest has been resolved but maybe not yet updated in Alla's site.</div></div><hr />

Totemic, Crafted, Lambent, Darkforge, Ivy Ectched, etc... There was no druid version of it.<br />
<br />
The 'pine' armor quests were released 5+ expansions later</div></div><hr />

<br />
We gained class Armor in Fear (Verm), and Hate (Harmony) as well as Velious.<br />
<br />
Lower Armor was then added in Quests from the Twilight Sea.<br />
<br />
Droppable sets appeared from Elysians in Umbral, for at the time, higher end druids who could group/solo them.<br />
<br />
The Armor of the Pine, honestly, sucks for the level range which was designed to complete the quests, namly because the armor is much harder to aquire then Crafted, Darkforge, or Ivy armor.<br />
<br />
If your looking for a lower end Armor Set, the Twilight Sea is probly your best shot.<br />
