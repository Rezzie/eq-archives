<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maporfic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, my spellbook is a disaster. I don't know where to start to organise it. <br />
<br />
Anyone have a spellbook layout that works well for high end raiding druids?? I am looking for somthing logical, that if another druid logged into my char they could easily find the spells.  <br />

<br />
After reading it, I think it is OK.. but really just a starting point, and not necessary to have 10+ &quot;hotkey&quot; banks if you just do some planning up front.<br />
<br />
Its a good idea to delete out old spells..  Right-click any spell and then press the &quot;DELETE&quot; key on keyboard to do this.<br />
<br />
Face it, when you are 50+ you will never need to cast/memorize Minor Healing, Skin like Wood, Strength of Stone, etc..<br />
<br />
This can also help others using your account since they probably don't know that &quot;Storm Strength&quot; is better then &quot;Strength of Stone&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
Keep your teleports together to make them easier to find,<br />
<br />
Group the expansion teleports together to make them stand out (Lord help the people using your account to know that &quot;Wind of the North&quot; is the Skyfire teleport).<br />
<br />
Keep the spells that you normally use (your most used spells) on pages 1 and 2 of the spellbook to make them easier to find and easier to re-memorize after a death.<br />
<br />
Other then that... it is all personal preference.  I can not really help you with an exact list till I know what level you are (to know what spells you have).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>netura emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i would never delete a spell. Just put it to the back of your book....it has plenty of room.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Geddine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I have mine setup into 10 keys.<br />
<br />
I place all old spells at the back of the book.<br />
<br />
Group them in the 10 groups -<br />
<br />
Single Ports (Rings, Gate, Egress)<br />
Group Ports (Succor, Circles, Winds, Evacs)<br />
Self (Masks, Coat, Wolfform)<br />
Buffs (DS, Strength, Po9, Invis, SoW etc)<br />
Misc Buff (Resist Buffs etc)<br />
Heals (Direct Heals, regens)<br />
DoTs (Swarm Line, Fire line)<br />
DD's (Seperated into Fire/Cold/Stun/AE/Rain)<br />
Debuff (Snare, Root,  Fire/Cold Debuff etc)<br />
Animal (All Animal related spells, other page has Summoned related)<br />
<br />
Note: Things like Single Ports and group ports take up about 5 pages each. All the others are groups of 2 pages (16 spells)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've got my most commons spells on pages 1 &amp; 2.  My 2 bests DoTs, my 2 best Nukes, Eagles, Regen, Snare, Root, that sort of thing.  <br />
<br />
Next page I have group spells, or spells that I don't use as often, but still need regularly.  Like dispells, resists, that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
Then, all animal spells, and summoned<br />
<br />
Then other stuff that's occasionally used.  and a page of lvl 49 spells (I use them for buffing newbies)<br />
<br />
After that, it's the ports.  I have 1 page of single ports, to the most common destinations like Nexus, PoK, etc.  On the other side are the same spells in group form.<br />
<br />
After that, more single/group spells in order of use.  Everything else goes in the back of the spellbook starting from page 50 backwards.  (You can type /book 50 to get there instantly)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">After playing with /testbuff on TEST yesterday I have to say that I really like the new right-click spell menu system.<br />
<br />
It is quicker, and more convienient.</div></div><hr />
