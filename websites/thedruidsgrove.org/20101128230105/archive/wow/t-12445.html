<br />
From looking at my profile (when I logged out in my tanking gear), it seems to put a bit too much emphasis on gear.  As from everything I've read in several Bear blogs, I'm more than ready (gear wise) to enter Kara, but they have me just below Kara.  Only able to tackle the first few Heroics.  Though, this could be because I'm still a couple points low on +def (should get my S3 gloves tomorrow).<br />
<br />
So, take the report with a grain-of-salt.  But it does provide some good information (did you forget an enchant?, gems?).  Just make sure you log off in our Boss ready PvE gear before you run the report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a 70 druid yet so I plugged in the info for my 70 hunter and it seems to be pretty much in line with my impression of where my hunter is at, progression wise - keying for Kara.<br />
<br />
I like how it offers suggestions for enchants / armor  patches, and has tooltip links that give the details about the items and  enchants.<br />
Very cool.  Hope it stays available for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't do it today (Tuesday), but I find that morning and mid-day scans tend to work more often than those in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
I think it does guild scans as well, though I haven't tried that yet.</div></div><hr />

My report gave me flak about not enchanting my cloak, but there is no way I'm wasting eight Primal Shadow on Bishop's Cloak!  Lol ...<br />
<br />
It also said that I have some talents that &quot;smell like PVP&quot; because I'm 13/0/48 ... but I already grabbed everything I needed out of the resto tree (HT talents?  No thanks!) and IMO Nature's Grasp (w/ Imp. NG) and Control of Nature are perfectly viable PVE talents for a druid regularly running ZA.<br />
<br />
I guess that, overall, the ratings are a good indicator of whether or not someone in your guild is really slacking off WRT gear ... but, as mentioned, you can't just blindly accept everything the report says--use your own judgement as well!</div></div><hr />

I think the estimates on Druids are a bit off.  It seemed to think I could get a bunch of upgrades and I doubt I could get most of them without arenas.<br />
<br />
Of course... I could use some upgrades, but other parts of my gear are really good for pre SSC.</div></div><hr />

I found the site quite useful.</div></div><hr />

I'm sort of an out of the box thinker.  For my druid it gave me a perfect tanking score.  Where as my pure pve warlock got bad marks for not being cookie cutter.  I out dps every warlock in my guild atm, but since I am demo instead of 0/21/30 it says I'm sub par.  Its almost as bad as the gear rank site that doesn't take into account present gear and spec's that aren't cookie cutter.  Meaning http://maxdps.com/index.php  .  Good site but lot's of overlooking, if you mean to be unique.</div></div><hr />
