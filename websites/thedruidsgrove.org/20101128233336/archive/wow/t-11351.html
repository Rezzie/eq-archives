Unfort for us nothing really screams high dps, thus the price for being ferral.<br />
After that  I was going to get 2 pieces prob the boots and hands since they're cheap and I get back my +20 sta bonus that I miss :).</div></div><hr />

If I have time the gloves since I like the bonus they give for PvP.  That way I&quot;ll have the speed bonus for when I PvP off 3 items giving me the rest of my gear to replace in BC.  Also I've found in my experience with raiding up through MC and leveling that a good shoulder/helm is hard to find for a druid.  So I'm hoping on that trend to keep the shoulder/helm up until I can get my hands on the arena set :)  <br />

Currently I am wearing the blue pvp set to give you a thought on where I am at.</div></div><hr />

It will be the last hand out to people that dont want to work for their gear. Arena will be the only epic PvP gear and that requires skill to win.</div></div><hr />

Not...just people who can dedicate 12-16 hours a day to a game...not life. Lets face it...in the couple of years WOW has been out, if you really had skills you would have reached lv14 eons ago...but no, it took hours upon hours upon hours of grinding out (probably many times getting owned) to reach the epic gear. Stop whining about it in every thread lorath, geez you've posted the same complaint like 10 times. Move on, BC will be here and everyone will need to start working to get decent gear again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I recall reading on the arena system you actually only have to do like 10 matches a week or some low # like that, so it really is skill not time based.  Doing more matches gains you no more points or something along those lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bryne, you should first understand what your talking about before you open your mouth and put your foot in it. The arena system IS based on skill. It is solely based on your win loss ratios and as you rank up, you face off against higher ranked teams. The better your team gets, the better competition gets. So yes, Arena will be the only obtainable epic PvP gear that require skill. If you beat the #1 ranked team, and they have played 300 matches, and youve only played 10, your still now in #1 on the ladder.</div></div><hr />
