They remind me a lot of the deeds system that LotRO has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gyin</div><div class="date">07-18-2008, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The deeds system in lotro gives a lot of abilities and you pretty much have to do a lot of them in order to improve your character.<br />
<br />
It seems more like the inane five millions different titles you can &quot;earn&quot; for your character in EQ2.<br />
Would be good if they could adopt a similar system to the EQ2 Lore and Legend abilities.  You get a book and study a type of mob by examining a load of different body drops from that mob type.  Once you have examined them all you can do a special two minute cooldown attack on that mob type that does high damage.  It is a pretty decent system that gives a nice to have reward that isn't game breaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">07-18-2008, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they put them in there to &quot;compete&quot; with other games that have similar systems.<br />
<br />
That said, since the rewards are just cosmetic, I assume the only players bothering to perform them are the same folks that participate in Holiday quests/events.  So, this gives them something to do between the summer event and the fall event.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rovaedne</div><div class="date">09-24-2008, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Gyin that WoW could learn from EQ2's Lore and Legends and their Achievements system. Both of them are outstanding. And add in mentoring with both of those systems and it is suddenly quite rewarding to mentor down. Because of the leveling speed and the size of EQ2 you can't actually do all the instances as you level up. So there is plenty of Achievement experience to be made by mentoring down and exploring and completing quests in these new to you instances.<br />
<br />
If WoW had a system like this there would be less need for end game content. And finally some really good reasons for higher level characters to return to old content. The problem is Achievement is like XBox360 achievement not EQ2 or EQ achievement. It's cosmetic. Bragging rights. But it doesn't improve your gameplay or otherwise improve your game experience.</div></div><hr />

And the coolest feature (IMO) are the combat stats it maintains (biggest single hit, total damage, total heals, etc.).  I did noticed it didn't detect quite a few things that I had done, like several reg BC 5-mans, several heroic 5-mans, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm still afraid that Achievements may become some sort of measuring stick for player skill...&quot;LFM must have AP &gt; 600&quot;.  Must have &quot;Make Love not Warcraft&quot;, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never considered this. excellent point. Skill, at least in WoW, rarely correlates to a player's Achievement count.<br />
<br />
I'm sure anyone who has played a sufficient amount of WoW knows someone that has done EVERYTHING and gone EVERYWHERE and is still painful to be around even after all that experience. And, of course the opposite, the player who was an excellent player, fun to be around, inventive when playing new content but quit a year ago and will have virtually no Achievement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">09-25-2008, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok a couple of guildies are today suddenly racing off to kill every boss in every instance no matter wot level in order to qualify for more points ?? when Wrath goes live which they say they can turn into good gear incl epic stuff ???<br />
<br />
so they are at 70 rushing off to solo/duo Deadmines / SFK / Gnome et al !!<br />
<br />
is this really the case ?<br />
<br />
then as newer players they say the want/need to go kill the world bosses....dragons etc and Ony.. ?<br />
<br />
a couple of people were getting depressed thinking they 'had' to go off and get faction rep to exalted with all main factions..ie Og / TB and then go and kill every boss in an instance they may never have actually been into - ie some new players just went right to 70 and outlands and never really did the whole Strat / Scholo / DM places....<br />
<br />
i'll read up on that link of your Yrys a little later and maybe it will provide the answers....</div></div><hr />
