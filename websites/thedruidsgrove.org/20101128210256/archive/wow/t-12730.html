So when I'm bored I need to find better ways to add utility to my group..... <br />
<br />
So I was thinking of a resto/feral hybrid build. My goal is to be able to tank regular non-heroics and maybe do some off tanking on trash pulls and some tank/cc heavy bosses like Moroes, and i hear on HKM dps warriors can tank some of the counsel. I have some bear gear already and I have an Alt that can make heavy clefthoof... with some gear and the below spec, how feasible is my goal<br />

<br />
You should probably get Primal Fury instead of Predatory Strikes. The extra rage will help more than the extra damage will. <br />
<br />
Without mangle...ugh. Well, you'll be doing a lot of mauling and swiping. Your threat won't be great. You won't have LotP either, so your group ability and crit won't be super high. <br />
<br />
Not taking naturalist is also a huge problem - might as well, as it benefits both trees. <br />
<br />
You should also get Natural Perfection - if you're going to be critted, might as well reduce the damage.<br />
<br />
All that being said...I guess it could work. The resto tree looks mostly okay, though you'll be poor at soloing without the balance bits and your raid utility will be poor without better motw and insect swarm. You should be okay as long as your gear isn't too bad. Wouldn't want to bring you to a serious progression raid, but you should be able to find spots in Kara okay.</div></div><hr />

It might even help with rage generation since you wouldn't have mangle. You could probably handle some of the kara trash as well if, for example, you were given the mob second on the kill order. That should be plenty of &quot;alone time&quot; with the mob. Clefthoof gear and maybe two pieces of the vendor bought pvp gear could potentially get you close to uncritable and would be a decent amount of sta. Threat would be my primary concern. <br />
 <br />
Again though this isn't optimal<br />
 <br />
Edit: In the resto tree I would probably do the standard furor 5, naturalist 5 lower tree build unless you find yourself shifting a lot as a tree(?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least now I think I have a decent starter set if I ever want to respec. The gear really isnt the issue, its not being able to switch gear in a fight, and not having the talents to really compliment feral.<br />
<br />
It kinda sucks that you have to go so far in feral to make it worthwile. So, I am going to stick to Resto/Balance, particularly since my resto set already has over 600 +damage<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time  feral siblings</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that in mind, find some understanding friends who don't mind helping out while you experiment in a lowbie instance (eg ramparts) with tanking.  I'd say that would be the safest way to learn, try stuff, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And gear.  Very important for druids.<br />
<br />
Resto druid in tank gear = tank.<br />
<br />
Not an amazing tank perhaps, but a tank nonetheless.  Note that you will need much higher resilience/defense skill than a feral druid would, as ferals can supplement these stats with the Survival of the Fittest talent.  Pvp gear would be a great way to get started.<br />
<br />
And spec.  Honestly, it really is the least of the 3 considerations, but lets take a quick look anyway.<br />
<br />
I think you have the distribution of points about right, and actually the spec overall looks pretty nice.<br />
The only thing I would say is that you should consider swapping 2 points out of the the Predatory Strikes talent, and put them into the Primal Fury talent instead.  This will give you more rage while tanking and thus allow you to generate more aggro.<br />
