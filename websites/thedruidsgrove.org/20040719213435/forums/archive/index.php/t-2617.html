<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daeddwin</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been 61 for a little while now, and I've been working on AA's.  I've thus far spent 8 points total.<br />
<br />
Innate Metabolism 3 (I spend as much time as possible on my leezard)<br />
Innate Run Speed 3<br />
Radiant Cure 1<br />
<br />
I currently have 1 AA banked, and I'm planning on buying SpellCasting Fury 1 as a toy when I've got my next point finished.  After that... I've been thinking about buying SpellCasting Mastery 1, Mental Clarity 1, then saving up to max out SpellCasting Mastery.  That seems like a pretty fair plan to me... curious as to other's thoughts.<br />
<br />
I'm also curious as to what works well for other Druids.  I'm Alteration Spec, and I tend to focus on healing so I'm trying to decide between Healing Gift, and Healing Adept to work on after I max SCM.  On the one hand, a % based bonus to heals could be neat... but does it work on Tunare's Renewal and Karana's Renewal?  On the other hand, crit-heals sound helpful... but I've heard horror-stories about crit-healing a small heal and gaining aggro very early in a big fight.<br />
<br />
I'm just looking to hear what's worked well for other Druids so that I can make some smart decisions about which AA's to buy.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwynet Woodsister</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would start with advising to get 65 first of course, but I don't think it was the point of your question :p <br />
<br />
There are already a few topics about AA choices, so you can prolly find good information there.<br />
<br />
It depends a lot on whether you want to optimize your character first or have fun. If you just want to have fun, just take whatever you want really, in the end it will be the same anyway. If you really want to make sure that you make the best choice though, get SCM3 first. Getting SCM1 alone isn't really worth it until you plan to get the 2nd and the 3rd afterwards. And SCM3 is really great, the best AA we can get.<br />
<br />
I don't think that spell casting fury 1 is worth it, to be honest I really started seeing a fair amount of criticals with fury of magic 1 - I stopped there because I think that the number of points required afterwards is too high. SCF1 is very disappointing, criticals are just very very rare. Same for SCF2.<br />
<br />
Healing adept works on TR and KR, healing gift only on fast heals like nature's touch and nature's infusion. Both HA and HG work with nature's infusion and nature's touch.<br />
<br />
I got both. Healing adept first then healing gift. Healing adept is nice but I totally fell in love with healing gift. The problem is that it's pretty useless until you get nature's infusion in my opinion. That spell is I think the best reason to get 63, and once you have all those healing AAs maxxed healing more than 4k in less than 4 seconds is wonderful.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'm almost sure than criticals (heals and nukes) do not give more aggro than a normal cast. But NI is pretty bad aggro by itself anyway :p <br />
<br />
In your case, I would get healing adept first, and not worry about getting healing gift until you get 63 and nature's infusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TeriMoon</div><div class="date">07-03-2003, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are doing fine.  Probably most people would say your best bet is to get SCM3 right away.  I agree that for overall effectiveness, that is true.  But, EQ is a game and not a job, and SCF is great fun :) .<br />
<br />
As to the HA/HG question.  This is rather like SCF/SCM question in some ways.  HG gives you that nice eye candy, but over the long run HA is much more effective for what you are doing.<br />
<br />
RC is nice, but SotW is better, and less amount of AAs overall.  A very very handy skill.<br />
<br />
I think that its fine to try this and that, but ince you have tried a few fun things, really get to work on SCM3, SOTW, HA3, and SCF3.  Those would still be my top priorities for how I play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolaque</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're doing the right thing by understanding what your choices are now, and then making a plan.  Since you are alteration, SCM is very important as the high level heals use a lot of mana, go for SCM3 as soon as you can.  Then I would pick up Healing Adept next.  <br />
<br />
SotW is very nice to have.  While MGB (in conjunction with SotW) and Exodus can be very useful in raids or groups, nothing is quite like innate camouflage.  I would seriously consider getting that as soon as your able. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iegil</div><div class="date">07-06-2003, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SoTW is a must, its a druid celestial heal and often turns a battle even in a single group.  Or at least eases minds.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Mastery is the skill to get.  none other should take a precedent in my book.  Why you ask?<br />
<br />
30 percent off mana...<br />
<br />
IE, the heal thats 400 mana = 120 free mana rebate.<br />
<br />
or 120 ticks of mc1<br />
or um 12 minutes of medding, from just one cast.<br />
<br />
Nukes, a nuke thats 400 mana = 120 free mana rebate if you make your specialization check.<br />
<br />
3 nukes = 360 mana... or almost enough for a free nuke / heal.<br />
<br />
mmmm double damage on one nuke = a crit right?<br />
<br />
an extra nuke = the amount of damage you could crit for?<br />
<br />
or a pretty high percentage of &quot;crits&quot; to equal that discount.<br />
<br />
So an ability that so drastically changes your mana consumption, Increases your &quot;staying power&quot; and &quot;decreases down time&quot;  in an active group is awesome.  <br />
<br />
Crits, improved heals, are all &quot;marginal&quot; improvements over your abilities.  <br />
<br />
This ability can turn a 4000 point mana pool into a 5200 point mana pool for casting purposes.<br />

LOL...I wish!</div></div><hr />

We have nothing else like sotw except our regen lines, which aren't going to buy a group any time on a bad pull or due to poor agro management by someone.  Sotw has it all over innate camo in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiniane</div><div class="date">07-07-2003, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use SotW ALL the time.<br />
<br />
It's great when I'm soloing and I let the mob get too close.<br />
<br />
It's great in an xp group if a few members are slightly dented.<br />
<br />
It's great on raids - MGB SotW rocks :) <br />
<br />
And definitely get SCM3. After that it all comes down to your play style.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duranstorm</div><div class="date">07-09-2003, 03:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that has the description that the game has for scm.<br />
<br />
it says &quot;The increase in the caster's chance to successfully use his specialization is 5% for the first skill level, 15% for the second skill level and 30% for the third skill level.&quot;<br />
<br />
and that really means nothing =)  SCM3 gives a 10% mana savings on every spell you cast, and it adds to your normal spec saving of 11% for your 200 one and 2% (?) for 50 ones.<br />
<br />
still very much worth it, but not 30% savings.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apocalypse Criterion</div><div class="date">07-18-2003, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose Run and Regen 3,<br />
<br />
SCM 3, SCR 3, SCM 3, and working on the pop FoM atm,<br />
Also have DC, Innate Camo and Mental Clarity, SotW and the Group Cure, along with WotW.<br />
<br />
I love SCF, at level 3 with the pop critical aswell you can really crit very often! (13% I'd estimate, and the day ou critical 3 waves in a rain spell your'll get an applause ;) <br />
<br />
SCM is decent, although I have yet to decide if it really gives you mana saving per cast or just the 30% extra chance of a specialisation as it states.<br />
<br />
SCR is solid too, and Mental Clarity is a relatively cheap FT3 in essense (while it stacks).<br />
<br />
SotW is, as stated, a VERY good group saver or buffer on big mobs.  WotW can be thought of as a free 900 nuke every 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
If I had to start my AA again I would get SCM 3 first, then SCF second.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ClaeophaRah</div><div class="date">08-06-2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;SCM is decent, although I have yet to decide if it really gives you mana saving per cast or just the 30% extra chance of a specialisation as it states.[/quote]<br />
<br />
Test it for yourself; I did.  <br />
<br />
I took off my MP3 item and just ran with SCM3 to eliminate variables.  My mana pool was ~3500 at the time, and Fist of Karana (my current quad spell) costs 357 mana.  Close enough to 10% off my mana bar per cast, except that's not what I saw.<br />
<br />
As I'm Spec Alt, I'd assume that each cast of FoK with SCM3 and Spec Evoc (50) would cost me 13% less mana or so, or 275 mana, which is 8% of my visible mana bar.  And that's what I saw.  Each and every cast of Fist of Karana dropped my mana bar 8%.<br />
<br />
I suppose that's non-conclusive given the size of my dataset, but it is fairly strong evidence to me.  I would expect (unless SCM3 gives me a 100% chance of specialization, which would amount to the same thing anyway) that at least a few casts would cost me the full 10%, but in literally hundreds of casts I never once saw that occur.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not the only one who's parsed it, that's just a visible example that I myself have experienced.<br />

<br />
No need to do that again when you can just check out the thread linked below which states the mana savings gained via SCM.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovefrm18.showMessage?topicID=90.topic&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;SCM thread from the Archive forum&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lalian</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't think getting just 1's is helpful.  I didn't really notice a huge difference with SCM until I hit that 3rd level.    Personally, I plan to get SoTW next.  Seems to useful to go without but NI first :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatankawd</div><div class="date">08-08-2003, 10:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;SCM is decent, although I have yet to decide if it really gives you mana saving per cast or just the 30% extra chance of a specialisation as it states.&quot;<br />
<br />
Every person who has ever tested this has come to the same conclusion:  SCM1/2/3 saves an extra 2/5/10% of the base mana cost of the spell, each and every time.<br />
<br />
In addition, pre-AA, everyone who ever tested spec savings concluded that there never was a &quot;chance&quot; to get the spec savings.  You get the same fixed mana savings each and every cast, depending on your spec level in that skill.  A spec of 50 saves about 3% of the base, and a spec of 200 saves about 11%.<br />
<br />
Many archived threads can be found here, at Graffe's, and other boards detailing the testing methodology carried out.<br />
<br />
I can't, FOR THE LIFE OF ME, figure out why after all this time, SoE hasn't updated the description of these AAs yet.<br />
