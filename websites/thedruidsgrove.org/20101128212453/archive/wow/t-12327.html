<br />
Ok, I am returning after a lengthly break from WoW and have finally hit 70. I am looking for a  PVP Feral spec. I am enjoying the in your face play style since the buff to our trees. Any criticism is appreciated constructive criticism is greatly appreciated. Oh, and sorry if this thread has been created plenty. Here is the build I am looking at<br />

<br />
I am also considering <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure which is more valuable longer stun or thick hide or if someone has an alternative<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I would move all 3 points out of thick hide, whap 2 in Nurturing Instinct, and the last one in Feral Aggresson.  That would suit my playstyle better, but as with all things your mileage may vary..<br />
<br />
I really think thick hide is a weak talent.  As I understand it, for 3 precious talent points you are getting maybe 500 extra armor at best.  It doesn't stack favourably with bear form either - a bear who normally has 20000 armor would have 20500 instead.<br />

<br />
Personally I would take nurturing instinct, but that's because it suits my playstyle - I offheal quite frequently, if I think my rogs are about to die.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
But the stun is also very nice, it really helps with stunlocking, and you will get use out of it all the time.<br />
<br />
It's really just about personal preference :&gt;  You could go with either, they would both be good.<br />

Talents are there to somewhat specialize your character and make you unique in the world of mainstream &quot;best&quot; gear and builds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not required but it certainly makes the job of kiting warrior/rogues much easier (and some people think of it as a crutch). However I think NG has a lesser importance for Feral PvP just because it is a melee dps spec and the only time you would need NG is to get away and heal...and if you're feral you could always bust out Maim's and Bash much quicker too.<br />
<br />
I would personally put 2 points from Thick Hide into Brutal Impact and the last into NG..just because I love it but I don't see it being a necessity for feral.</div></div><hr />

Lies. ...this improves your armor BEFORE changing into bear. 100% -&gt; +400% = 500% armor<br />
110% -&gt; +400% = 550% armor. From wowhead. Can someone confirm this for us si vous plais.</div></div><hr />

The 10% boost only applies to armor from gear.  So, armor gained from AGI does not get the boost.  Read that on EJ last night.<br />
<br />
And the wording of the talent seems to back that up.</div></div><hr />

If you don't fall in those categories, you get very little benefit from this talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-BC I didn't like Thick Hide.<br />
<br />
Post-BC, a tanking druid would be missing out on some well placed mitigation ( unless AC caped without it...which....is it possible? ) without the talent. <br />
<br />
PvP-wise the 3 points are better spent elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Weak talent imho unless you spend all your time tanking in pve.<br />

I am starting to collect honor and tokens now so that I can get some decent PVP gear instead of quest blues and greens. 1 AB token away from my chest and 5K honor away from my gloves after that :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I flip flopped back and forth between the two options for quite awhile and determined when I die most of the time it is form more then one person on me so the chance to CC one of them wasn't going to help so I went with the small boost in the heal that I can get off. So far so good, but may try it the other way after awhile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
once i hit 39 im going to hit hit the battle grounds for the highlanders gear and the insignia of the alliance<br />
<br />
i was thinking of using this build <br />
<br />
http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/talents/druid/talents.html?0100000000000000000005032021203000000  0000005500001000000000000<br />
<br />
should i loose the point in NG and put it in sharpened claws for the extra chance for a crit?<br />
<br />
what do you recon? think i will be topping the battleground leader board?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">02-12-2008, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I recently put a point in Nature's Grasp. Albeit it took me some time to remember to use it (420 will enhance the learning curve) :smoke2: <br />
<br />
Now that I think to use it consistently (I hotkeyed it to &quot;F&quot;) it has many applications. I feel that it's primary use is in damage mitigation and emergency healing on melee targets.<br />
<br />
A bash or maim on the target you don't want to entangle really helps land it on your preferred target. Then you can back up and heal, flee, entangle someone else...myriad possibilities.<br />
<br />
In PvP, it has such a generous cool down that I don't even think twice about using it now. Any melee class rooted is an open invitation to being ganged up on. And a rogue that isn't jumping around like a spaz is a good rogue. :grin:</div></div><hr />
