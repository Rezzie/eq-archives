I made another druid and she's 19. I cannot remember where I get my swim form. I went to my druid trainer and it doesn't say anything bout getting my swim form. Nor could I find it in the &quot;unavailable area&quot;. I have her set in Feral for now. Could that be the reason?</div></div><hr />

The first part of the series you have to speak with Dendrite Starblaze in Moonglade.  I think you can start this around level 16.  He will give you a quest to swim to the bottom of the lake to pick up a shiny bauble.  The next quest makes you find two pendants to form the Pendant of the Sea Lion.  For Alliance: the pendants can be tough to find...if you have the coordinates UI they are located in Darkshore at 48,11 and Westfall 17,32.  Both of the pendants are under water.  For Horde: the pendants are in Sludge Fen (NE corner of The Barrens) and North Tides Run (the north beach in Silverpine).  The Sludge Fen pendant is located at 56,8.  The North Tides Run pendant is tough to find since it's deep under the ocean.  It is located at 29,29 (just west of the shipwreck).  ...that is pretty much it.</div></div><hr />
