<br />
From http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10043226143-what-is-your-intention-for-berserk.html<br />
<br />
 Okay, I guess Koraa didn't get a chance to post it today.<br />
<br />
1) Feral Faerie Fire becomes a core ability.<br />
2) Brutal Impact increases duration and lowers cooldown of Bash. It swaps with Savage Fury, mostly to keep it out of the paws of anyone but Ferals.<br />
3) Feral Faerie Fire replaced with the old Last Stand component of Berserk. But it's usable in both cat and bear forms.<br />
4) Cat Berserk does not change. Bear Berserk goes back to Mangle hitting 3 targets, and since that isn't so useful on single targets, it also removes the 6 sec (untalented) cooldown of Mangle during the 15 sec duraton for some nice bear burst or threat generation. The Fear immunity is still intact. <br />
<br />
 Yes, Bash will now work as an interrupt even if the boss is stun immune.</div></div><hr />

Still a little sad that they're effectively splitting my tree, but I imagine it'll differentiate between a kitty who's wearing a tank costume and a really solid tank?</div></div><hr />

It will be interesting to see how this split tree thing works out...<br />
<br />
Some of this is repeated from above...<br />
* Dash cooldown reduced from 5 to 3 minutes.<br />
* Faerie Fire (Feral) isn't a talent anymore and is now a baseline skill<br />
<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
* Berserk doesn't heal you anymore in bear form but causes your Mangle (Bear) ability to hit up to 3 targets and have no cooldown instead.<br />
* Rend and Tear now increases damage done by Maul and Shred on bleeding targets by 4/8/12/16/20%. (up from 2/4/6/8/10%)<br />
* Mangle doesn't increase the damage of Maul and Shred anymore<br />
* Protector of the Pack now increases your attack power in Bear and Dire Bear form by 2/4/6%. (Old - increased the bonus attack power by 20/40/60%)<br />
* Predatory Instincts changed from 5 to 3 points, now While in Cat Form, Bear Form, or Dire Bear Form, increases your damage from melee critical strikes by 3/7/10% (Old - 2/4/6/8/10%) and reduces the damage taken from area of effect attacks by 5/10/15%. (Old - 3/6/9/12/15%)<br />
* Savage Fury has been moved from Tier 5 to Tier 2<br />
* Brutal Impact moved from Tier 2 to Tier 5<br />
* *New Talent* Survival Instincts (Tier 3) - When activated, this ability temporarily grants you 30% of your maximum health for 20 sec while in Bear Form, Cat Form, or Dire Bear Form. After the effect expires, the health is lost. Instant, 5 min cooldown</div></div><hr />

Previously, it was just Mangle, now it is more generic.  We didn't lose anything just a tooltip change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hm...  I'm not entirely clear on how that will work.  Will Mangle still increase the damage of Shred by 40%?  The wording seems to indicate otherwise..  It looks almost like we are losing the 40% buff, and getting a crappy 20% in return (for 5 talent points).<br />
<br />
At this rate will it even be worth getting Mangle?<br />
Might we see a return of Claw? :P<br />
<br />
I can imagine in such a situation Rake would be pretty handy.  Make them bleed, then shred shred shred..<br />

So, the wording on Shred and Maul changed to reflect a more generic phrase &quot;bleeding&quot;. <br />
<br />
The problem is trauma debuff overwrites the mangle debuf so our dps would get nerfed if a warrior put up trauma.  blizzard fixed it such that we get the buff even if trauma is up.<br />
<br />
Here's the new description of Shred...<br />
<br />
&quot;Shred the target, causing 225% damage plus 742.5 to the target. Must be behind the target. Awards 1 combo point. Effects which increase Bleed damage also increase Shred damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
here's the new description of Mangle(Cat)<br />
&quot;Mangle the target for 160% normal damage plus 507.2 and causes the target to take 30% additional damage from bleed effects for 12 sec. Awards 1 combo point.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
We've got it really good right now.<br />
<br />
Last night in Kara I was second on the dps chart at 600 dps, behind a warlock who was putting out 800+. We wiped twice on Prince because the MT was dropping too fast, so I switched to bear form (28k armor) and tanked Prince. I should point out half my kitty's gear is blue and most of my tanking set is blue. <br />
<br />
I'm not terribly surprised changes are coming.</div></div><hr />

Reading the EJ Druid thread (daily), I'm tired of the whiners.  I often point out the good changes and most folks dismiss them as stupid.  I'm not sure what exactly these people want, but I for one am quite excited about LK.  As a tank and DPS.<br />
<br />
The only things that I'm PO'd about are...<br />
<br />
<br />
 No flying mounts unitl 77.  That just sucks!  I just might take a week off work to level to 77.  Then sleep for a week.<br />
 Vanity Pets no longer take up bag space -- that was the only thing that kept them &quot;under control&quot;.<br />
 Achievements -- I think they have the potential to have a huge negative impact on the game as they become some sort of ranking system for players.  &quot;LFM must have AP &gt; 600&quot;</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling it will be stamina for tanking gear though, and agility for cat gear since we don't benefit any more than the other tank classes from agility any more.<br />
<br />
Let me run this theory past you guys:<br />
<br />
Given that we do not have enough talent points to take all the best tanking talents and we will be getting defense on our non-armor pieces, is it possible for us to save a talent point or two in SotF by stacking defense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-22-2008, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes... you could do that, but it depends what other stats you have to give up.  In theory though you could gem and enchant for Defense to make up for the shortfall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">09-22-2008, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, from what I have read we will be stuck with defense as a 'wasted' stat anyway. My thought is we may as well use it.<br />
<br />
This is what I am looking at for bear spec atm, without taking my above theory into account: Bear (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGGscrdceocIu0o0Eczb)<br />
<br />
It looks like the new trees are hugely improved, imo. Feeling much joy atm.:thumbsup: <br />

They are introducing a fetch ball that you can play fetch with these vanity pets though, so far as I've heard.  <br />

I can only imagine how that'll affect things.  I only bring mine out when I need some cheer uppins.  Otherwise they sit in the bank and take up space.<br />

<br />
That could work, though I'm wondering why you wouldn't take improved mangle.  A reduced cooldown on mangle would significantly increase our TPS I would think in bear.   I like improved LotP a lot actually though I suppose for tanking purposes it's not really as key.<br />
<br />
I was overlooking your PvP kitty spec though and wonder why you wouldn't want to take improved LotP or shredding attacks?  Shredding attacks really gives you the edge you need on your opener.  I suppose now with Tiger's fury you could substitute that, but I wouldn't want to blow a 3 minute cooldown on my opener.  <br />
<br />
I haven't actually played beta or on the PTR but I find shredding attacks especially useful.  Also I usually take nuturing instinct if only because I end up having to off heal a lot in arena/BGs.  Though with the lack of int on our gear in LK I suppose that will be much less of a viable option.  =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
This list seems to change daily....<br />
Here's is an new sorted TPS estimate based on a full blue 80 bear set. This is assuming infinite rage on a single target.<br />
<br />
Talent: Max rank TPS (TPS per point)<br />
<br />
Savage Fury: 510.65 (255.33)<br />
LotP: 139.71<br />
Primal Precision: 242.13 (121.07)<br />
Rend &amp; Tear: 383.58 (76.72)<br />
Predatory Strikes: 205.42 (68.47)<br />
Naturalist: 318.71 (63.74)<br />
Predatory Instincts: 182.44 (60.81)<br />
Sharpened Claws: 167.65 (55.88)<br />
Imp Mangle: 151.58 (50.53)<br />
Protector of the Pack: 132.14 (44.05)<br />
Feral Instinct: 82.01 (27.34)<br />
Shapeshifter (5): 134.84 (26.97)<br />
SotF: 54.07 (18.02)<br />
<br />
This order should remain relatively the same if threat values change. As gear levels improve, PI will move up a place in the list. Obviously for multi-target tanking FI goes up and if low rage RnT goes down. I also haven't modeled Berserk (or KotJ) for bear, it will slightly lower Imp Mangle and up Savage Fury.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping my estimate for Lacerate is off. Right now I'm assuming the constant threat scales from 70 to 80 at the same rate the bleed damage scales (285 @ 70 =&gt; ~588 @ 80). If the 20% damage threat mod still exists, any AP scaling will barely affect threat. Pure swipe is almost equal to just keeping the bleed up (similar to current). Although, the bleed will buff maul through RnT. Maybe they wanted to keep the current bear cycle instead of spamming one or the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
One more thing, I suspect we'll see a rage 'nerf soon.  In T4'ish gear (including 2T4) on the PTR I had nearly infinite rage while taking on that 71? elite ogre that roams on the plateau above shat.  NR and PF result in a ton of rage, I even used FR.  And, I think, there are new raid buffs that give us rage when we crit or something like that.</div></div><hr />

I haven't met one bear yet who wants to drop 5 talent points for that.  <br />
<br />
I wasn't even remotely interested in taking that talent for tanking o.O  <br />
<br />
tljb: I can't help but think that the infinite rage has something to also do with the massive armor nerf we got in the new patch.  Out of curiosity did you spec natural reaction?  Did you notice a huge difference with the rage generation?  <br />
<br />
Lately I've had to actually swap out items because rage starvation makes it impossible to really properly tank.   Also have you managed to tank any instances or raids yet?  I'm just curious because I'm really worried about my tanking abilities after the new patch.  I mean, I know a druid in full T6 has little to worry about with an armor nerf, but I'm barely at armor cap and I'm a bit worried about what everyone has said is an approximate 10k armor reduction for bears.  <br />
<br />
I know LK gear is going to supposedly fix all these things but I was just curious how much it's going to change stuff for BC until we get the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Rather than 10%???Out of curiosity did you spec natural reaction?  Did you notice a huge difference with the rage generation?  Yes I had NR, PF and 2T4 on.  Rage was not an issue except for the first few seconds.  Wait, I just realized why this particular test (ogre dude outside shat) might not be all that valid.  He spawns (often) non-elite skeletons.  I'm sure I dodged their attacks often which would have led to an insane amount of rage (3 per dodge).  At near the end of the fight I think there were 5 of them.<br />
<br />
I'll have to try this on a son of gruul or something and see how it goes.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I lost about 4K armor over live (26K rather than 30K), though I didn't take 3/3 Thick Hide.  Not sure how much that would have helped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the tradeoffs forced by the new trees. My thinking was that I didn't want to give up the threat burst of KotJ for IM, and in general I would prefer to Maul and Lacerate between Mangle cd's. Of course final threat gen numbers may have me modify my expected rotation. I just read a GC post that bosses in LK don't change targets when they fear, so PT may not be as valuable. Might be worth looking at trading MS for R&amp;T instead now.<br />

PVP was the hardest spec for me. Again, maybe dropping MS so I can pick up SA and max out SotF might be the best decision. Otherwise, what would I give up? 2 points in FI? I really don't know...tough choices.<br />

We are getting the loving, but its a bit more subtle.<br />
But the same problems cat druids have at the end of BC will more than likely exist in end game WotLK. Ask yourself this question and then tell me what blizzard has &quot;fixed&quot; so this doesn't happen again:<br />
<br />
Why do rogues do so much more damage and scale with gear so much better than druids?<br />
<br />
My answer? Dual wielding, white damage and haste. To me those are the biggest reasons (there are more, that's for sure) for the ever-widening gap between rogues and druids. How has blizzard addressed the problem? They make haste effect our ppm of OoC. <br />
<br />
OOOOH! HASTE B SO POWAH NOW I LUB TO WHERE ROGUE GEAR FUR IT<br />
<br />
No matter how &quot;balanced&quot; we end up being on beta, 1-2 years from now when everyone is wearing Tier 9 gear, what makes you think DPS druids will be in a better position than we are at the end of BC? <br />
<br />
And if that isn't enough doom and gloom, think about this: now that druids are forced to wear rogue gear and other than &quot;tier tokens&quot; no druid specific gear will drop in pve, what has blizzard changed to make that more attractive than it currently is to wear rogue gear. So right now, when a piece of rogue gear drops, we can look at it and point out all sorts of ways that the item budget could have been spent to make that piece of gear better for druids. In most cases we would rather the budget points be spent on STR and AGI instead of AP, crit rating and haste rating. And that's because STR/AGI benefit us so much more than AP/crit/haste. What did blizzard do to make AP/crit/haste &gt; STR/AGI for cats?<br />
<br />
I'd LOVE to be wrong, but I predict more of what we saw in BC: great at the beginning to the point of overpowered, and severely lacking once everyone has geared/overgeared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think that Improved LotP helps alot with mitigation, correct me wrong but 4% heals to yourself every 6 seconds or so while tanking with 16k or more is 640 hp every 6 seconds.  any way we can help out a healer (and the rest of the raid) is a bonus.<br />

Thunder Clap -- Increase in threat generation. No target limit. Swipe gets the same treatment. With these changes, all 4 tank classes should be able to generate very respectable AE threat. Consecration is still a little higher in threat to account for Thunder Clap's debuff.<br />

I'm not sure we could run out of rage in an AoE scenario.  Swipe, swipe, swipe. maul, swipe, maul, swipe, maul.... Don't forget Maul hits 2 targets with glyph.<br />
<br />
That said, I think Blizzard just took the easy way out.  I really wanted them to boost thorns (or a new self-only version) of thorns.  At least we still have to deal with positioning issues.  Though from what I read, swipe is really a &quot;chain effect&quot;, with an initial 5y radius, but chains can jump upto 8yards, which means you can probably pull in casters as well.<br />
<br />
And for BG PvP, this will be a great flag protection skill.  Bear, swipe, Berserk (mange hits 3 targets), barkskin, FR (which is really nice now), etc.</div></div><hr />

If you get us swiping with the crits landing (which right now at 70 I'll crit up to like 350 damage) its going to be insane.  10 targets x 350 damage... hmmmm 3500 DPS...  translate that to 80 where you'll probably hit for 450 damage.... x 10 targets... <br />
<br />
With that and our dodge tanking mechanism thats just too powerful.. I completely agree.<br />
<br />
However this brings up an interesting idea for feral druids... AOE burn down situations where you aren't tanking.. you could go for enrage.. build up rage, get a nice head of rage, burn Berserk and then swipe like nuts... should keep you competitive with the aoe'rs.</div></div><hr />

I hate to say this as I usually think that folks that do are a bit too elitist, but....<br />
<br />
...is Blizzard dumbing down the game too much?  Or have they made other changes to encounters/mobs to &quot;make up&quot; for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-29-2008, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you'll find that they keep upping the Ante so to speak on the raid and boss encounters.  They keep requiring you to do more and more.  The amount of things and lessons you need to learn keep going up.  Having AOE tanks won't make it better necessarily.  Some fights can be shortened with AOE tanks, but odds are they'll start throwing in mixed groups where if you tank two or more of X mob you'll be in a world of hurt.  So some will need to be AOE tanked and others will need to be single target tanked.  <br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't so much as dumbing down the game as making it so you can play with your friends and not feel guilty.  Instead of having to tell Joe he can't come because we don't need a ret pally we need this shadow priest that we hate... but he's the only one we have, you can bring Joe now.  I'm a little saddened that we lose some of our orginality, but in the end they are making it so any tank CAN tank anything, but only the ones who really work at it will be capable of doing it.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of ways they can make the game require skill w/o making certain classes required in order to overcome specific encounters.<br />
<br />
Regarding the change to swipe; I would have preferred demo roar become our aoe threat/damage ability because its shape more closely mimics that of consecrate.  I would guess it would be an easy change to implement and class balance would be easy to achieve.  Swipe is definitely the more problematic solution from my point of view, with the caveat that I don't know the technical situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused...<br />
<br />
Or is it that we'd swipe, hit the main target for X amount, the other 4-5 targets for amount Y and then hit the other targets within a certain radius for damage Z?<br />
<br />
I'm imagining that the swipe would only cause a small amount of damage to any target beyond targets 4 and 5?  Just enough to generate a little threat?</div></div><hr />

Right now it seems as though Feral tanks maybe a bit OP (too much threat and too much mitigation) for PvE thru Naxx, so I expect we might see a slight nerf at some point.  But folks are still QQ'ing because we didn't get a bunch of new buttons to push.<br />

With 4/5 furor you'll shift in at 80 energy and then regen to 95 during the GCD before you can use any. With 0 latency that means that the 5th point of furor is worth 5 energy. You may as well put that 5th resto point in IMotW.That is a very, very good point.  Might as well put at least 1 point in iMotW while you are leveling.  And this makes me even more comfortable with my decision to go 2/2 iMotW, 3/5 Furor at lvl 80 when Rank 9 MotW comes along.</div></div><hr />

It seems to be more useful for those at the bleeding edge in the game.  If you are just a T4 player (like me), the options shown are nearly worthless and very difficult to filter out (every thing is gem'd with epic gems, sunwell, gear, etc.).  Plus you get the 5+ entries for the same piece based on gemming which is really annoying.<br />
<br />
It is just not user friendly.</div></div><hr />

You can really track what's going on in your rotation and what's being the most effective, and I think that will end up really informing your playstyle.<br />
<br />
As for Rawr, I really do enjoy it, but I tend to agree that it's really when you're being a picky bitch that it's exceptionally worthwhile. You can do some gem customization, but there's a lot of hoop-de-doo to flip through.<br />

I did a little write up (although the program has been upgraded about four times since) here (http://www.unbearably.net/2008/03/13/rawr/) and here (http://www.unbearably.net/2008/03/15/rawr-update/).</div></div><hr />

Right click edit of each item makes it easy to put the gem of your chioce in whatever gear you are looking at.  It would be nice if you could globally select gear that is available to you by instance or item level, but once you've done it once or twice it really is easy to use imo.<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that so many low ilevel items are best in slot, but that is a Blizzard itemization issue, not a RAWR issue.  My guild likes to use wow-heroes or be.imba as a general guideline for determining who to invite on raids.  With things like Necklace of the Deep and Earthwarden only being ilevel 100, those sites rate me much lower than my actual performance.:banghead_  When I switched from resto to feral, I ground bg's to gear up since I had bypassed all the good feral drops and quest rewards.  Now everytime I upgrade a pvp piece my wow-heroes rating drops...<br />

And don't knock tlbj's age, the only person close to my age in my guild is my younger brother!:nono:</div></div><hr />

Right click edit of each item makes it easy to put the gem of your chioce in whatever gear you are looking at. Right but that is so clunky.  If I want to compare my shoulders with 3 other shoulders how do I do that?  I have to modify every entry of the &quot;other&quot; shoulders to use gems I'd buy.  What a PITA.  Why can't I just select &quot;rare&quot; gems option?  And a &quot;show only 'best gem option'&quot; based on your gem setting would be nice instead of showing me 10 combinations for each piece.<br />
<br />
It just needs 2-3 things to make it so much more usable.  Unfortunately, the devs have said over and over they are not planning on adding source filtering because their data source (blizzard) doesn't provide it.<br />
<br />
A gem quality option,  a &quot;best gem&quot; only option and a source filter (T4, T5, BoP LW, quest, badges, etc.) and it would be the best by far.  Check out www.lootrank.com,  it has the best filtering mechanism I've seen, but it doesn't do the theorycrafting like Rawr.  If the two of them would make love and have a baby, we'd be set.</div></div><hr />

Aye, I'm sensing more fights involving non-physical AOE dmg to come. I'm wondering if they're trying to showcase DK anti-magic abilities a little too readily.</div></div><hr />

:(It is not clear if just the AoE portion applies or both the AoE and crit bonus?  If both only apply to cat, then it can be safely skipped for bear builds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oiysters</div><div class="date">10-05-2008, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given the latest changes I would go with NR for the extra rage.  The PI nerf to bear mitigation is also a nerf to bear dps/threat generation.  Off the top of my head NR seems to do a better job of compensating for the loss of PI than PotP in five mans.<br />
<br />
Theory: Why not take a look at IW?  Since you are talking about pre-80 5 mans, IW could be worth as much as an 18% reduction of incoming damage, which I believe is superior in potential to both NR and PotP on all but raid boss fights.  You'd have to look at the rage and threat ramifications of that choice though.</div></div><hr />

On multi-mob pulls, I doubt that is possible all that often.<br />
<br />
If IW would land on Swipe, I'd take in a second, but that would be seriously OP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With bears catching up to warriors for tanking tools, we have a chance to be full time MT's now!<br />
<br />
I've seen some anecdotal stuff though that people are saying it's harder to heal a bear in Naxx than it is a warrior or a paladin as a result of the latest round of changes.  Have to keep an eye on that.</div></div><hr />

Emphasis mine, likely won't be needing either of those talents until the level 80 heroics -- (refering to this blue (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8765643774&amp;sid=2000))<br />
<br />
3) In 5-player instances, most warriors, druids, paladins and death knights should be effective tanks. The healing specs may have a harder time than the dps specs. Arms wariors, Fury warriors, Ret paladins, Ferals and most DKs should do fine.<br />
<br />
To answer the question though NR would be a bit more relevant to both soloing world quests AND instance tanking. If I stay as feral spec I'd always include IW anyway... at the very least it's great utility for all pesky runners whether of the PVE or PVP sort and at its finest it's great mitigation against big spiky hits from instance bosses.</div></div><hr />
