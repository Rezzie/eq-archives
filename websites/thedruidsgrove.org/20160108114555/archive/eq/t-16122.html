 <br />
I know he spawns 4-6 mobs that Cheal him, and then depop.<br />
And I have read if you keep him inside his room, they dont attack but still Cheal him.<br />
 <br />
I tried to check it out myself, by clearing the trash and the two guards. Once target-able, I attacked and evacced. I was hoping to see how many, and where they popped. When I got back, there were no adds, and he depopped after a few more seconds, so I need the answers to a couple of questions please.<br />
 <br />
1. Do they pop on the outside of his room?<br />
2. Do they all pop together, or one at a time?<br />
 <br />
Oh and while I'm here, I also nipped over to Qinimi, to get a look at the Commander. He was up, so I strolled over to his room. Just as I entered, he and his 2 Guards wandered out, and all the Mastrugs from nearby, some from off the roof too came down for a big Mastrug group chat. <br />
 <br />
I asume this is part of the script, so is it advisable to clear all the trash before I zone in?<br />
 <br />
Or do we hold back until the commander has gone back inside, and just clear any trash in his room, before fighting him in his room?<br />
 <br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I remember going in there, killing the guy in like 15 seconds and dealing with mabye 6 adds that hit for nothing and died quickly.  They all stay up on the platform so you don't really have to sweat clearing down below.</div></div><hr />

I believe that they all popped at the same time, although I may be wrong here, as I wasn't able to pay 100% attention to this part. They didn't spawn immediately though, it took some time for them to arrive.<br />
 <br />
Clearing trash beforehand in Qinimi is a good idea, otherwise you will have to deal with the dozens of grey adds during the named fight. Make sure that not only you don't zone in before the trash is dead, but also other druids who are at the same stage of the progression, because another druid - even if the druid has the shard container in bank - can spawn the mobs. Because of that, I can't really say if / when he returns to his room. But we fought him in his room and it worked okay.</div></div><hr />
