However, I don't do many instances and maybe upper instances are more lucrative/usefull for herbalism? <br />
 I was thinking of doing enchanting, for smoking heart of the mountain(is that what it's called?) and disenchant for all my binded gear. <br />
I do however like to pvp alot and engineering could be real handy. Any opinions?</div></div><hr />

However, I have not tried engineering though so I can't give an accurate opinion.</div></div><hr />

I love being an enchanter, you can farm instances for shards and enchanting whatever I want when I get an equipment upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Then again I'd miss out on my Hide of the Wild pattern when it finally drops.....*sigh*</div></div><hr />

The only real uses it brings to end-game are repair bots and the Hyper Radiant Flame Reflector (which is part of my FR gear package).  I did put on a fire-work show in ZG with the cluster launcher... <br />
<br />
In PvP/BG's it's good stuff.  Rocket Helm for CC'n, Grenades/bombs for AoE'n Flags in AB or another stun, Ice Reflector for dealing with hunter traps, flame reflector for pyroblasts, world enlarger for mini-flag cap'n, discombobulator for dismounting... and lots of laughs along the way.<br />
<br />
Let's not forget the Death Ray!</div></div><hr />
