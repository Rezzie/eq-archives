We dropped into the water and the fatigue bar immediately popped up.  I freaked 'cause my hearthstone was still on cooldown lol.  Luckily I remembered the teleport and took off to moonglade but it was neat 'cause somehow while I was in the water I discovered &quot;Lordamere Internment Camp&quot; wherever that is.  I was lvl 30 and got myself 255xp from it :P  (I have a screenshot I took shortly afterwards which is why I remember hehe)</div></div><hr />

It is completely random what happens to your character when you get disco'ed while traveling on boats/zepps/gryphons.</div></div><hr />
