 <br />
I really need to do some dailies on my Druid, but just cant stand killing things with my 8/11/42 spec (used to doing dailies on an epic warlock / warrior and just tearing through things).  <br />
 <br />
I'm getting poor from buying gems / spellthreads / mats etc.<br />
 <br />
What kind of spec do you guys think is going to be strong for dailies (come 3.0 - dont think im gonna respec before then as its pretty close and a free respec).  I'm not currently doing arenas on my Druid, just bg'ing and healing pug heroics / kara's.  I'd like to keep tree form, but still be able to kill things.  Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Currently the issue is that your &quot;spell damage&quot; is way low in healing gear.  All that hard earned purple/blue healer gear is going to become pretty dang good DPS gear in about a week.  So it won't hurt to just kind of see what your DPS is like in about a week because you'll get a pretty substantial bump from the traditional say 95 healing and 25 damage gear... when your spell power goes up to say 65 from 25... that's a big jump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-07-2008, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point. I think I'm gonna go with a 20/0/41 build and stay in my healing gear, maybe throw in a few dmg pieces http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0EMbzVZZf0Iubuxmuq0o<br />
 <br />
Or probably http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0EMbzMZZf0Iubuxmuqco as Replenish looks pretty nice.<br />
 <br />
Edit:  hmm, 2 points in Vengeance or Moonglow?</div></div><hr />

I went from 2k heals and 700 damage on my healing gear on live to 1050 spellpower on the ptr.  Light's Justice went from 382 heals to 203 spellpower, iirc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">10-08-2008, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am a Tree.  And, I have tried every spec known to Druids, in order to complete my dailies in a timely and orderly fashion, and I've learned the following:<br />
<br />
Full out Boomkin - Sure you can kill'em fast but I found myself reaching for Swiftmend way too often only to realize, &quot;Hey!  Where'd it go?!?&quot; then my emergency heals sucked so bad that I ended up dashing off anyway.<br />
<br />
Dreamstate - You can kill them and you can heal yourself.  Sweet!  But you are still a healer to your guildies, and have you ever tried to heal a 5-man with a Dreamstate build?  Unless you absolutely love Healing Touch, it's rather stressful.<br />
<br />
Raiding - Having all your points in the Resto Tree leads me to assume you heal raids.  If your guild is anything like most others, you'll be expected to be at your full healing capacity by Raid night.  And, most raid leaders prefer a Tree over a Dreamstate build.  So, that means paying to respec on a weekly basis.  It gets costly.  And all that gold you've earned goes towards respeccing.<br />
<br />
Balance Points - It is possible to complete dailies effectively - albeit slowly - with as little as 12 points in the Balance tree.  <br />
<br />
My link (if you care):<br />
<br />
http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Misha&amp;n=Magellan<br />
<br />
It's not a perfect build (this time I gave up Celestial Focus and I kind of miss it) but I never die, I make money and I'm always invited to the Raids.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that's my personal perspective, and if you don't agree you can tell me to go pound salt.  Perhaps you don't raid all that often and never run 5-mans.  If that's the case, I guess I'd recommend Dreamstate.  It's a riot on the battleground and you're still considered a healer.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Right now I'm 8/11/42 for cyclones / charges / imp bash cc).  It works really well for amazing CC in BG's, and healing is strong in instances, but my Starfire Root Wrath killing is sloooow.  <br />
 <br />
I do try to pug Kara's and heroics when possible, though my Druid's server is pretty dead right now with a lot of people taking a break before wotlk. <br />
 <br />
I'm gonna pick up tree and everything that buffs HoT's (leaving out all HT nonsense), not sure about 2pts in tranq.  The reduced cd makes it a lot more attractive, and 0 threat is awesome, but its still a ton of mana.  I'll probably end up taking it, as its a great O$HIT groupheal... hmmmmm<br />
 <br />
On a wotlk note, Genesis, Moonglow and Nature's Splendor seem pretty necessary in balance (for healing) huh?</div></div><hr />

I'm very surprised how little impact it's had over my ability to do dailies bearing in mind I'm still gearing up in Kara. Granted it's still a chore compared to doing them on my hunter, but it's not been the huge impact in DPS that I was anticipating.<br />
<br />
I do miss my insects though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My sPriest just dinged 70 (in silly greens and pitiful blues) and has just started on the Isle.  She struts through there killing with incredible ease, barely breaking into a sweat while my poor Resto Druid sits in the corner and bawls with envy.  <br />
<br />
Of course, that poor Resto Druid - being a healer - will see a heck of a lot more raid time than the sPriest, so when all is said and done, she still comes out the winner. <br />

<br />
If talants stay as they are i think i will choose this one @ 70<br />
http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=0000000000000000000000000000023003331250150  2000000000000532033100331330010000000000<br />
<br />
<br />
and this one @ 80<br />
http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid=0000000000000000000000000000023003331250150  2031000000000532033100331330013300000000<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this will suit my play style for solo and healing in 5mans + the 3 cool resto glyphs<br />
<br />
Glyph of Rejuvenation<br />
Glyph of Lifebloom<br />
Glyph of Regrowth<br />
