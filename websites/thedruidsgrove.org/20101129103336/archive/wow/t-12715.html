<br />
i finally broke 1500+heal (yay), but i have a question! <br />
<br />
Does anyone know if the pvp free movement trinket works on the Maiden's Incapacitate? <br />
What i've been doing is just making sure all my heals are rolled on the MT even if they are overhealing and that seems to work but it'd be nice if i could break that incapacitate once or twice during that fight. Aside from the fact that if it worked everyone could grab the cheapy 8k honor trinket and at that point Maiden would be a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The healers can stand right at the edge of the top step, just out of range of of the Holy Ground and silence and the MT can reposition Maiden during a repentance so that the holy ground will hit a healer or two and break the repentance.  <br />
<br />
Or just before you expect a repentance to go off you can run into the holy ground and take some damage. <br />
<br />
Your choice :)</div></div><hr />

The way we did it was that i just made sure that the tank had all possible HOT's running before she popped it, even if the repentence is impossible to time, it worked and we downed her. It was the holy fire that was the real PITA but we made sure we had a holy pally and he was cleansing like a madman. sucks that the trink doesn't work i thought i was being all smart and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eowynne</div><div class="date">07-03-2008, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maiden is a really simple fight as a healer/dispeller when you have SmartDebuff (cleansing addon) and BigWigs or DeadlyBossMods running. My original main is a holy priest that can dispell magic just as a pally can, just by clicking on a little highlighted icon, which means no worries about her holy fire, cos it's dispelled even b4 it can hit if you are quick. DBM will warn you when the repetance is gonna take place to 1/10 of a sec. Place yourself on the first step of the round stair around her, and 1 sec b4 repetance is going off , step forward, take 1 hit of her AOE, repetance will break, take a step back and continue healing as if nothing happend :thumbsup: , your MT will not even loose much HP, as you should HoT him up b4 repentance starts.<br />
As a side note, we once did Maiden with 10 druids, 3 Feral, 3 resto and 4 boomkin, we had an &quot;omg&quot; fight, cos noone could dispell the holy fire and we had to heal through it, fight lasted over 5 mins, which is really long,  but TS was filled with laughter and joy, cos our cuddly bears needed almost no healing :grin:  druids ftw</div></div><hr />

I heard an all druid kara group got stick at Opera because they couldn't interrupt Jullianne. :(</div></div><hr />

Feral Charge is another spell interrupt.. :&gt;  Two bear druids could just take it in turns.<br />
<br />
I would love to try an all-druid Karazhan sometime.  So many druids !<br />

<br />
We dropped Maiden like a bad habit last Wednesday. I got the Shard (JOY!). We also did Curator and Shade on our first tries. Got Prince to like 16% but that fight is a doozy, gonna probably try again tonight maybe line up Terestrian and Netherspite alongside the other bodies. <br />
your MT will not even loose much HP, as you should HoT him up b4 repentance starts.<br />
This worked like a charm, we just had the priests on dispell and raid healing duties and i just spammed all my HoT's, i was thinking about grabbing DBM but i read that her repentence timer is random, can anyone confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">07-07-2008, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes it is random. The upshot is she will only do one spell action at a time. In other words you don't have to worry about someone getting a holy fire while repentance is up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pookies</div><div class="date">07-07-2008, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Repentence has a CD after which it can be cast at any time.  This is not an uncommon boss mechanic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iz1988</div><div class="date">07-07-2008, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">to your initial question- i was actually sure that the trinket would release you from the repentance. after all it does cause you to &quot;lose control of your character&quot;. I distinctly remember our healers rotating its use for that fight. But it was all so long ago now! :D <br />
<br />
Good luck with your raid! The progress sounds good :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />
