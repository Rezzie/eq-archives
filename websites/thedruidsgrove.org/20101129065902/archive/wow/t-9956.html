I was thinking rooting one and run away in cheetah to give some space. Other then root we have no other option do we? Unless of course one of them is a druid in feral form we can sleep. I'm getting slightly better at pvp.. one on one I can win most of the time vs someone near my lvl. However higher lvls it seems harder to fight someone 1on1. My only strategy currently is stalk them wait untill one of them is low on hp's then hope I get a good crit in.</div></div><hr />

Thats how you get camped.  Trust me, when people do that to me, assuming I can find them again they see me a LOT after that.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Green Whelp Armor (you can wear at lv 30) helps bigtime (5% chance to put the attacker to sleep when hit), though this is getting nerfed for people past lv 50 in the next patch.<br />
<br />
Third, root is a great form of crowd control.  Root one of them (preferably the non ranged attacker.. no point in rooting a mage, lock, hunter, etc.) then go to town on the other.  Root the melee, get away from it, cat form + dash and shred the cloth wearer.  If you are fighting two heavy ac classes, root the non-ranged, then fearal charge the ranged attacker and maul ftw.  Remember to use all of your healing abilities and bear form and you should be ok.  Roo</div></div><hr />

At that point to me anything goes. I'm going to have to get myself some of that green whelp armour, do you know how it's getting nerfed post 50? I think I may hold off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">01-24-2006, 12:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitley get the armor.  LW's can make it.  It should cost no more than 1g on any AH.  <br />
<br />
They are making mobs / players post lv 50 immune to the sleep effect, and reducing the duration that people who hit you are put to sleep to 10 sec from 30 sec.  Still probably the best chest piece you can find under lv 50.  Throw a heavy armor kit or +3 to all stats enchant on it and youre golden.  Just remember not to dot any of the things ur fighting, or it will break the sleep effect.<br />
<br />
If they attack you first, I agree, anything goes.  And pvp vs 2 rogues without green whelp armor is tough.  Rogues exist for the single purpose of killing you quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is a healer they will negate what damage you do and that's that.<br />
<br />
If there is not a healer, you could always to try to play the dot + heals + bearform and try to outlast them.<br />
<br />
Chetah would work well if they couldn't catch you and kept dot's on them.<br />
<br />
In all actuality if you just take one of the 2 you did really good.  If they play well as 2, you really shouldn't be able to beat them.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know other classes can play against 2 rather well such as a hunter or maybe even a mage due to their traps and polymorph respectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2v1 is fun and challenging.. just remember to keep an eye on both enemies, not just the one you're attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">01-25-2006, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I owned two level 60 Hunters the other night in AV. I was prowling in the Field of Strife and saw a lone hunter riding on his wolf. Positioned myself to pounce him as he went by, and followed it with a Shred. Shifted to caster and rooted him before he could get away (was still mounted). Hiberbated his pet and at this point he dismounted and started to shoot at me. Bear &gt; Charge &gt; melee. Had him down to about 50% when another hunter joined them. Betting they thought I was easy pickings, but I used every trick in the book. NS+HT, mana pot, frenzied regen, you name it. Finally managed to kill the first hunter, then rooted the second and finished him off quick. Two good hunters working together and I wouldn't stand a chance, but luckily for me that wasn't the case for these two :)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, hunters used to give me so much trouble after they had their talents re-vamped, but I think very few are still beastmaster specced, and that just means their pet is generating a ton of rage for me when I'm in bear form. I don't avoid them any more than any other class.</div></div><hr />
