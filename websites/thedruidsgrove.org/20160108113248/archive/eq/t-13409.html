We tried to do it yesterday. But after the second update when we are supposed to &quot;face&quot; the seeker, he never spawned. Had everyone leave task and try it again. Still no luck and the bastage wouldn't spawn.<br />
 <br />
I've already done this, but was trying to do it again for guildmates.</div></div><hr />

I do not know what the task leader did to make it work tho :( I was simply along for the ride with that guild and didnt get to see what they did.<br />
 <br />
It took us two times getting the task for it to finally work tho. And of course this was months ago before the new expansion, which I think has messed up alot of the &quot;old&quot; tasks.</div></div><hr />

If you can get someone to stand right at the spawn spot and get aggro on him the instant he is up, you can pull him and continue.</div></div><hr />

He should aggro tank and you can just pull him back to usual camp. May take a few tries to get it right but it works till spawn issue gets fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also actually killed the seeker after 2 Ch's.  No Shattered Seeker spawned, no loot and no message of completion.  We restarted task all worked fine.</div></div><hr />
