The feeing of never realy beeing safe in certain areas is a rush you cant find in most games. <br />
<br />
I just want to ask some other people this question...Do you panic really bad when you are in a spontanious PvP battle. For me as soon as i see that rogue behind me or a warrior charging me i freak out and do the stupidest things imaginable. I can never use the spells i want to, i come up with the perfect strategies in my head but then they fly right out the window when i get attacked and you see me flailing my staff around like im some kind of melee class outside of feral...and using the wrong healing spells at the worst times...<br />
<br />
Im not really bad at PvP when im expecting a battle...but if im caught off guard its just terrible.<br />
<br />
just wondering if anyone else has this problem LOL. Go ahead and make fun of me =P</div></div><hr />

Your reaction is 100% normal.<br />
<br />
It will get less nerve-racking as you get better at the game. Although, in close spontaneous PvP situations, my heart still pumps rather quickly and the adrenaline flows. It's part of the fun of the game.<br />
<br />
Rolling my first toon, as a newb, I did the same thing. Your adrenaline starts pumping and your mouse moves all over the place not knowing what to click.<br />
<br />
I'm no uber-PvPer, but probably the best thing for you to do is learn the spells/skills of other classes. When you group with other people, ask them about their skills. It's especially helpful if you have a guild who can help you with these questions. Read their WoW forums too. You learn to counterract them and it becomes second nature.<br />
<br />
The first class I started learning about, PvP-wise, of course, was Rogues. I learned about how Hunters were the anti-Rogue class and that we have a lot of skills that counteract theirs. It was then that I learned the value of standing on a Freezing Trap.<br />
<br />
On my Druid, Improved Nature's Grasp is my tool of choice against a Rogue who jumps me. Keep spamming it until you're out of stunlock, Travel Form, then run like hell. You have an additional anti-Rogue tool if you are a Tauren Druid with Warstomp. You can always get away, Stealth and return if you want to do a counter-attack. Some Druids, stay and fight, but I have not tried that strategy. Most of the Alliance who do this hunt in packs on my server. ;)<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, Alliance Rogues devoted more than one thread to Warstomp + Nature's Grasp + Travel Form. They claimed it was ungankable ;) and wanted a nerf. Some even stopped trying because of it.<br />
<br />
Silly Rogues.<br />
<br />
Duelling helps, and if I lose, I always think of something I could have done to win, or ask the class I'm fighting, &quot;Hey, how did you do that?&quot; If they're a good player, they should help you because the knowledge you gain can help to kill the other faction.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though that duelling is not the same thing as PvP, since you know it's coming, but at least you learn better 1v1 skills.<br />
<br />
If you want a confidence boost, pick some noob Mage and duel them, then shape-shift out of their Poly and Frost Nova. They will have no idea what to do. Although Mages who know what they're doing kick serious butt.<br />
<br />
There are 5 factors to Spontaneous PvP success:<br />
<br />
1. Who gets the jump.<br />
2. Skill.<br />
3. Spec.<br />
4. Gear.<br />
5. Luck.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

The only way to get rid of the feeling is via repetition.  Once your body becomes accustomed to these chemicals that you produce, you wont feel the excitement/fear anymore.  It will be just like a walk in the part.  Keep in mind this is NOT a process that will happen over night.  Next time you get jumped, TRY to remember to slow your breathing and calm yourself down.  Its not easy but I know for a fact that it can be done.  I dont remember the specific reason off the top of my head, but I know it has something to do with the way humans have evolved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barks</div><div class="date">07-29-2005, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think knowing what to do and practicing these is key.   Getting &quot;Rogue-a-fide&quot; is the worst for me cause they can get my 56 down to 50% in the time it takes for me to be able to move.   Key for me is getting a good heal in and hoping they loose the bonus points they built up hitting me while I was stunned.   I run - heal - run - heal and by that time I am dead or have my wits about me.  and I can decide what to do.   FF is key so they can't vanish, but nothing says loving like a good root and wrath.   Then you will have the time to see how your supplies of health and mana are against his/hers.   <br />
<br />
Sometimes discretion is the better part of valor.  Not chicken to run, it's part of our advantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawdawg</div><div class="date">07-29-2005, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeh, whenever I am not expecting a PvP attack and it comes, I always have a 1/2 second of freak out.  Though on the first few times, I was semi-paralyzed, looking around at my abilities wonder what I should do.  But after a few times the paralyzation becomes just being startled and then after a few more times, you just ahve that adrenaline rush and you are thinking clearly and moving into action.  So its natural to panic a lot in the beginning, but do more and more pvp, and you won't panic much any more.<br />
<br />
I find that dueling a lot helps, even though it isn't a surprise it familiarizes you with how pvp goes and the abilities of all the other classes.  This help you think clearly when you do get surprised.</div></div><hr />

You described my reactions perfectly, whether I am my Druid or Hunter. I hate rogues. By the time we can move, we are near death.<br />
Sometimes I just wanna type /bye or /wave, and then die.</div></div><hr />

In fact, i have come backto kill a couple. As soon as it happens, i usually catch myself saying &quot;You'd better kill me before that stun breaks...&quot;. Maybe i have come across some less than talented rogues multiple times, dunno. They definitely make me jump when it happens tho, the jerks :P</div></div><hr />

Well, come on and tell us the actions you take once the stun wears off. Help your Druid brothers and sisters.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. My guess is that he does the same thing I do:<br />
<br />
Spam Warstomp + NG + NS &amp; HT (if needed) + Travel Form = Escape. Then go back stealthed and attack the Rogue when the opportunity presents itself.<br />
<br />
Not letting a Rogue kill you is one thing, most Druids should be able to escape once the stun wears off. Killing a Rogue after they get the jump?<br />
<br />
It can be done, but I don't usually stick around to find out. Any insight would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I miss my tauren druid for that reason :( shadowmeld is kind of nice to have though.</div></div><hr />

But even then most of the time NG + catform I can escape easy. After I escape I always go back stealth in cat form so I can be the hunter and they are my prey.</div></div><hr />
