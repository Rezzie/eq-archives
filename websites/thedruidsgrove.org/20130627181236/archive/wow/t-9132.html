Weapons are still changable, but armor is not.</div></div><hr />

I believe if you try swapping sets in combat, some like EquipManager just won't do it.  QuickMountEquip will actually wait until after you're out of combat to swap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawdawg</div><div class="date">08-02-2005, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct, if you are in combat, EquipManager will not change gear when you change forms.  Your weapon will change out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mekell</div><div class="date">08-03-2005, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the bugs with equipmanager as well, with bear form is that if you have Furor, it puts you in combat when you shift to bear form. This means any time you shift to bear form you are in combat, and your armor wont switch correctly (though weapon will). <br />
<br />
i get around this just by making custom sets, and equip the set i know i am going to be using before   doing it. I have my feral set and normal set, and regen set.</div></div><hr />

It has nice customization options, but there were a few things that bugged me about it.<br />
<br />
So I use Wardrobe. It's a very simple, easy to use mod. Check it out of you're not big on EquipManager either.</div></div><hr />

As such you are unable to switch armor, weapons still will switch but armor will not. If you are not actually in combat, and just changing forms, you can manually switch chest pieces after that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meen</div><div class="date">09-12-2005, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so that means that all equipmanagers slots - except weapon-slots - are obsolete for druids when they change form?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">09-12-2005, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All my info comes from reading other posts, so don't take my word as absolute. As I understand it, and please correct me if I am wrong, it is obsolete for anyone as long as they are in combat. So anyone else would have to switch before/after combat too. You can set an auto switch for the weapon, and then create a macro to use after you change forms. In equipmanager, create a custom equip set, say bearform2, then load the bearform2 after you have changed forms. But like I said earlier, if you are actually in combat, this won't do anything but activate the global weapon cooldown for switching weapons. Its really easier to just decide before hand whether you will be mostly casting/healing and want the int and spi bonuses, or will be using the feral forms and want the AC/STA/STR/AGI and +Crit bonuses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">meen</div><div class="date">09-12-2005, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, i understand why they limit the armor-set switching to outof combat.<br />
only, its a drag when u have to carry around 3 different sets without being able tu using them properly. but, well, challenging gameplay is the way of the druid, id just love to have another bag-slot, then :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

/agree I can always use more bag slots. I can have the absolute max spaces to put things, and no matter what game I am playing I always run out. It was worse in EQ because I was going for GM in all crafts so I always had tons of full bags and tons of mules.<br />

Personally i dont use those. I know when and where I am going to be using feral equipment, so i setup custom sets and just switch them based on the situation im gonna be in, and it works perfect for that.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they'll implement Kangaroo Form with extra storage.</div></div><hr />
