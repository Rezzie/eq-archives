Perferably on the Alliance side. I've always leveled and played Horde but now I'm wanting to try out the Alliance side. My main is a Druid and I've always liked the idea of a Druid only guild.</div></div><hr />

I know they are recruiting pretty actively, but I can't speak for thier culture or successes.  I have not been a part of the guild.</div></div><hr />

I can't find much info on them other than a video on YouTube. Also, I am looking to find one that is not on an RP server if possible.<br />
<br />
I'd like one on a PvE or PvP. This might be too many variables, and maybe I would just have to create one in which would make me ask if anyone would be interested in one?</div></div><hr />

Ironically an all Druid guild seems like you'd only see interest from the &quot;RP&quot; type players.  It's not like a one class guild would ever really have a shot at progression raids, would they?  Yes, they could raid, but only content well below their gear level, because you would lose all the buffs and versitility of multiple classes.  (have lots of shards in the guild bank though I would assume  :O )</div></div><hr />

But it is not like it is shoved down your throat by any means.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to avoid RP on a RP server is to not talk to anyone that is &quot;walking&quot; (rather than the default run) in a town.  As that is the primary indicator the player is actively RP'ing.</div></div><hr />

Well, as big as one could get, even if I was to start one, or get into one, I'm more of a fan of 10s anyways. I believe that an all Druid raid could do 10 Man Naxx. Heigan might cause some problems, but thats about it from what I can think of. An all druid raid would not have to raid below gear level. You would have to do some fights differently, but it can be done with out extra buffs from other classes. <br />

There was an &quot;All Druid&quot; raid that did Gruul in BC. They did have to get 1 warlock and 1 mage for High King, but other than that, the rest were Druids.</div></div><hr />

There were many stories of All-Druid raids in TBC, but I suppose I just heard them because I know of the guild that was doing them.  Again, they were all done in gear above that raids content. You can thank T6 badge gear for that luxury.<br />
<br />
A team in heroic blues/80 greens could clear Naxx-10.  A team of all druids would need to be in considerably better gear.  Buffs in TBC were a whole different ball game than they are now.  Druids do provide some pretty nice buffs, but from a healing stand point there are several road blocks.  Resto's have no way to dispell magic effects or diseases, nor the ability to reduce incoming damage on a target. Loatheb without PoH or Chain Heals would be considerably tougher too.  DPS wise, we can go toe to toe with any class (besides Surv. Hunters, and maybe DK's)  Tanking, again, we can do just about any job, but certainly there are major hurdles that would need to be overcome (some being addressed in 3.1).</div></div><hr />

I heal naxx10 with a pally friend (2 healer setup) if im not feral.<br />
<br />
And loatheb was a piece of cake.<br />
Just time 2 lifebloom to bloom in the non-debuff-time(2-4k), start wild-growth 2 secs before debuff runs out, start regrowth right after and nourish 2 ppl. Not too difficult. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it comes down to my definition of progression raids.  I consider progression raids to be raids of higher gear than you are currenlty equiped, and typically I refer to 25 man, since blizzard has suggested that 10-man is raid training wheels (although much of it is harder for mixed groups)  A one class group would struggle much more in 25 man than 10 man, just because of encounter design.</div></div><hr />
