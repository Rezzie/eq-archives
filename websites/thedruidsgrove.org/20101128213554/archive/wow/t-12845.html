I remember reading someone's post on here that pretty much everyone is dps spec and that the poster was tanking with more of a kitty dps spec and not having huge issues... are you having a problem finding healers for instances?<br />
<br />
I'm curious if we're going to experience a shortage of healers because everyone wants to level as quickly as possible when the expac releases...<br />
<br />
thoughts?</div></div><hr />

But with LK it may be less of an issue since healer gear is DPS gear for most healing classes.  Which means they can do some DPS while they have a healing spec (meaning questing isn't so painful).</div></div><hr />

They've pretty much set up 5 mans so people who are off spec should be able to fill in.  Once you get to the harder lvl 80 content then you'll probably need a real healer.  Unfortunately the bosses in the dungeons I attended didn't feel that difficult, but I had full Kara gear and quite a few badge upgrades too.</div></div><hr />
