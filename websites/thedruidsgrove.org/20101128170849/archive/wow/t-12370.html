I'm not the &quot;inspector&quot; type, but my buddy does it all the time.  Let me just say that there are way too many players in the game that just don't have a clue.:physics: <br />
<br />
Ex.  Last night we looked a lvl 60 warrior that had all of his Tier1 and Tier2 talents from all 3 trees!  Talk about lack of focus.<br />
<br />
I looked at a guildie hunter's talent tree (I have a lvl 70 hunter), yikes!  It almost looked like he rolled dice before placing each talent point.  I didn't call out his spec directly, but I made a point of telling him that if he need help with &quot;hunter stuff&quot; and/or talent builds, he could ask.  Or to go check out www.tkasomething.com (a druid's grove like place for hunters).<br />
<br />
So, next time you are sitting in the bank, or waiting for mail.  Pull up someone's talent build.  It just might be worth a laugh.</div></div><hr />

I giggle but then I think what ever floats thier boat, it's like when I level up a character, I knock off as many quests as I can before headin back to town.  But I have a few casual friends that will run back after each and every quest.  <br />
<br />
Its that MMO mindset that some people have and some people dont, I gave up trying to explain it to people a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

If someone &quot;wants&quot; to put points in laughably irrational places, what can you say about that person? If someone's definition of &quot;fun&quot; is divorced from objective reality, I'm simply not specialized enough to diagnose which specific mental illness they suffer from.<br />
<br />
I do however love it when these people roll on PvP servers.</div></div><hr />

It's a nub move but it's their choice. <br />
<br />
But yea, some people do play to have fun, and as for the 20/20/20 pally spec, they were probably trying to find a way to be good at all 3 roles instead of being awesome at 1 or 2 and being fail at another.</div></div><hr />

[Thread detour]<br />
Animal Handler 2/2, specifically the +4% to hit for the pet, is very much worth two talent points.  DPS theorycraft has been done to prove it. (insert link to TKAsomething.com threads here)<br />
<br />
Spirit Bond? Yeah, I cringe a little when I see a 70 hunter with it. :ohwell: It seems to appeal to new / levelling hunters, but I never felt it to be worth the talent points.<br />
[/detour]<br />
<br />
and now back to the regularly scheduled Druid discussion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agree.  Animal Handler 2/2 is required for any BM hunter.  Theorycrafters have shown that you only need Frenzy 4/5 (some say 3/5) which frees up the a point to max out AH.<br />
<br />
SB is worthless, I laugh every time I see that &quot;buff&quot; on a hunter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valkry</div><div class="date">02-07-2008, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea sorry, i didn't mean to say animal handler lol. i meant to say without it. You pet barely misses with that talent on which is awesome, because as said before, you only need 4/5 for frenzy (especially with animal handler). And you can always take 1 point out of endurance (maybe not so much for pvp) but definately for pve, becase an extra 200 hp or so won't make much of a difference to your 12k hp. Your healers shouldnt be leting you get down low enough for that hp to matter.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my next point, resto druids are awesome healers, can significantly 'reduce' the dps on a tank or they can chuck out roughly 3k heals instantly for only 170 mana. How tops is that?</div></div><hr />
