I wanted to ask the beta testers if our lev 75 dps has increased or decreased compared to lev 75 mob hp's? In solo, group and raid setting. Which spell lineups did u use when playing? (i am finding myself severly limited by only 9 spellgems, especially when soloing and grouping, as there are so many unexpected situations one can have to deal with. Worse of all, solo/charmkiting).</div></div><hr />

<br />
In addition, we also had access to a few spells which where cut so it is kind of hard to answer your question directly.<br />

I did not do any grouping/soloing while in there.  With raiding, all I really did was heal and try and debuff the mobs before they smacked us down.</div></div><hr />
