My latest build is designed to maximize my solo ability while still retaining the ability to MH non-heroics, and maybe even heroics with good group makeup and alot of +healing. <br />
<br />
This build is basically moonkin with dreamstate, and enough resto to get NS, imp rejouv, and 5/5 Gift of nature. Please evaluate this build and keep in mind I use healbot and this is my 3rd lv 70 so I believe my experience will carry me far. When I was full balance I healed BF and Ramp with ease.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

I know i should probably spec more for HT but problem is HT is 5 points in tranquil spirit and imp rejuv is only 3 points. <br />
<br />
1. Would it be more effiecint to try something like this http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/druid/talents.html?tal=500320212503131231000000000000000  00000000050050331301402000000<br />
<br />
Also i cracked under pressure last night and speccd tree of life, and i need to test it more but I had 3 observations, please comment.<br />
<br />
2. I lost about 125 +Healing because I didn't have Lunar guidance, and I lost over 40 mps because I didnt have dreamstate, I was upset with this because I'm thinking that out of tol I could probably achieve the same efficiency with a dreamstate build<br />
<br />
3. I drew alot of aggro in ToL, my 3 stacks of LB were ticking for 350 and I was drawing aggro on LB which I never did. Also I never had to drink which seems like if i wasnt ToL I could have been IS and FF.<br />
<br />
4. Is dreamstate still Viable?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hello Organtis.<br />
<br />
I've been a MH Tree of Life forever.  And recently respecced to Dreamstate to see what all the fuss was about.<br />
<br />
My primary reason for doing this was because my +healing as a Tree - with decent gear - was only at +1538 unbuffed (and that drove me crazy).  Immediately upon respeccing, my +healing went to +1711 unbuffed.  Needless to say, I did a happy dance.<br />
<br />
Soloing changed drastically.  Before, I would stand far back and pull one at a time.  With the Dreamstate build, I charged in like a maniac and pwnd.  :thumbsup: <br />
<br />
Changing my healing habits took a lot to get used to.  10+ Raids not a problem, but 5-man Heroics?  Considerably harder.  Not impossible, of course, but definately more stressful.  <br />
<br />
Dreamstate has it's benefits.  No doubt about it.  In fact, I love dreamstate.  Love it.<br />
<br />
But...(you knew that was coming, didn't you?)<br />
<br />
I will be switching back to a Tree.  I can go on forever about how I miss my Tree Form for healing.  But my biggest issue is that having to cast larger heals just sucks my mana dry.  Perhaps it's a gear problem on my part (I'm still using my original healing gear), perhaps I have the wrong enchants.  Dunno.  All the +healing in the world isn't gonna mean squat if I'm outta mana.<br />
<br />
So, long story short....(oops! too late!).....<br />
<br />
Dreamstate healing?  Adequate.  It can be done.  And with the right group, it can be done well.  <br />
<br />
Tree healing?  The best healing a Druid has to offer.  Especially a Druid who has their sights on Main-Healing.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I have went the way of tree after respeccing to do an instance. There are alot benefits I see.<br />
<br />
1. Its easier<br />
2. I get less scrutiny from pugs<br />
3. In PvP I can usually outheal myself when attacked by 1 or 2 players, which is very satisfying to see my teammates slicing and dicing why they are occupied trying to kill a tree with 3 hots and then an instant HT. Even as i get stunlocked my hots are ticking for 700-800 hps. <br />
4. I don't have to fill my bags with balance gear, even when soloing i found it better to keep my healing gear on for survivability<br />
5. I have also noticed that i get tons of invites to instances even when im not looking for one.<br />
6. Gear is more attainable on AH for healing than dmg leather<br />
7. Ive been lv 70 for less than 24 hours and I already have +1050 healing, I couldnt imagine haveing over 700 dmg if I hat focused on damage gear, I only regret I didnt pick more healing gear when I was questing, but at least I have a decent moonkin set if I ever need to respec for any reason.<br />
<br />
thanks for the reply</div></div><hr />

And yes, if you are not on a PVP server then your healing gear (perhaps with some damage gear mixed in) is the best for soloing.  You retain your ability to throw big heals on yourself, and with the regen afforded by PVE gear you almost never have to drink.</div></div><hr />

I was trying a new idea, tell me if its stupid. I figure with pvp I have two options. I can kite the enemy and never kill them, especially when they have full S3 and I dont. Or I can heal myself until they get bored or my friends kill them. I have had sucess with the second option particularly since I have a pve build and gear..... am I stupid?</div></div><hr />

I had actually thought of this, all stats aside, I was thinking that being in tree is like a beacon to rogues and warlocks. In a group of 5-6 friends I kind of blend in for a min or two unless i shift into tree, at which time i fall like a....... a tree.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I shouldn't have sounded so critical in my first post.  You're not stupid, your strategy just goes against convention.  :)  If it works for you, then do it.<br />
<br />
I personally prefer to heal myself while trying to avoid damage (by kiting) instead of standing there and taking the beating.  Especially if I'm not in my PVP gear, I have less than 8k HP self-buffed and that doesn't go too far when you're getting crit by a rogue or warrior (and ESPECIALLY if you have Mortal Strike on you).  If you can avoid just a couple of normal white hits, that's already a thousand damage.  Just something to think about.</div></div><hr />

Didnt work that well, and rogues / hunters / warriors wrecked me once they found me, but nonetheless I found it hilarious.  <br />
<br />
Pookies is right about maintaining mobility in PvP.</div></div><hr />

Cute!  I think we need shrub form for that!</div></div><hr />
