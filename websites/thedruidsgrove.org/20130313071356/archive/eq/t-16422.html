Where is a good spot(s) to solo in the new zones (completely solo)? No summoning stuff either! :smile: Just to snare / root / DoT / Blast sort of mobs. I think you have to have a certain faction to purchase some spells, so what are you killing to get that? I want to see the new stuff but I am &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT&quot; to much. Thanks in advance for any and all help.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
There is a repeatable quest called mash brownies from the top tower quest giver.<br />
 <br />
They are super fast but if you can watch the pathing pull easy and get them (hmm I am 77 so not sure how they con at 80) but good exp, relatively lower hps then icefall bears, spiders and drop tradeskill drops and cash loots.</div></div><hr />

Some are fairly resistant to roots but they don't have too many HP either.  Great place to get some faction, exp, and spell drops when you are bored or can't find a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A great camp is the were-orc camp in Loping Plains directly south of the zonein to Hills of Shade. About 10 spawns in the camp and plenty of area around it for rot-rotting.<br />
<br />
While I group for most of my xp I've been using this area to do the last 5-10%, rotting as many as 4 at a time. <br />
<br />
This is just one camp, there are many more. But this one is particularly generous with the kiting room around it.<br />
<br />
Now if they would only upgrade our quadding nukes....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you are lvl 80, they are mostly light blue BUT there are at least 3-4 faction quests that involve you killing them.  Once you add that experience (they do give decent exp once completed) they end up being very good solo exp mobs.<br />
<br />
The faction is a bonus as 2 of our spells are at that camp.</div></div><hr />

DB to lvl 80, theres a quest near by for slaughtering 20 of them, dont summon, all animals (charm or kite your preference), we can port to the zone, when you finish the quest you get faction and some xp.  If you know what your doing you can rake in some XP here.  Just mind my way if your on Povar heh.</div></div><hr />

Also a bit of Fangbreaker faction, needed for spells.</div></div><hr />
