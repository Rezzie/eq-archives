I'm looking to buy the druid account I have been botting w/ my beastlord, but am unsure of how much to offer the owner (retired guildee).  I've been keeping an eye on playerauctions, but no druids have come up.<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
*8.4k mana w/ 400 mana clicky, +4 or 5 mana regen clicky<br />
*Flagged:  VT, Time (I think), Qvic, 2 signets, DSK, Tarnished Chime<br />
*219 AAs, lvl70, no DoD/PoR spells :(<br />
*Expansions through PoR<br />
<br />
The closest I've seen are cleric accounts which seem to be a dime a dozen.  Doing a comparison to them, I'd guess ~$100 tops.<br />
<br />
Any guesses?</div></div><hr />

Condone it or not, this way I have a druid to play.  If it was an option of levelling one up from scratch, it just wouldn't happen - I don't have the playtime to do 1/4 of what I want atm, esp. not start a new toon.<br />
<br />
Druid is 73 now w/ 250AAs, 2.0/ancients, 10k buffed mana (haven't had much time to do katta missions), TBS spells to level from pirate faction, working on Frostcrypt faction (kindly), and I'm mostly having a blast w/ her.  Still need somebody to tank 68.3/4 for Reptile though!  I alternate raiding w/ BST and druid (nice to have the flexibility to bring in an extra curer when needed...I suck at healer overall for raids from suckass foci/AA), and am overall learning to be a semi-competent charmer/root-rot/pincushion/puller/botsuckassdpsfool.<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping that SoF upgrades both my chosen classes in a sensible manner that allows for continued fun....I'm not as hopeful as I wish I was though :(.  If not, I'll probably try to put in some overtime, and get money to purchase a knight/monk + sham or cleric account /lame.  I guess I too have little faith in the overall efforts of the dev team...one person being overwork/unwilling to fully consider Comm. Correspondent feedback/ideas can really ruin the game a lot.</div></div><hr />
