To my quick disapointment after I joined a wsg no one wanted to group, no team work everyone for themself pretty much.  Please tell me this is just bad luck. I remember in my 40's WSG was just a blast, when I hit 50 it was no more WSG just the chaotic mess that is AV.(although I must admit I had fun in AV last night when we took a small group and almost came back to win).<br />
Now I understand a PUG isn't going to always be coordinated.. but there was always communication. I ended up doing it 2 more times just to get the marks of honor so it wouldn't take up room in my invetory</div></div><hr />

On Uther, 3/4 Horde groups are made before entering a BG... the Alliance are the exact opposite, with most groups being formed at the start of the match.<br />
<br />
I've read about people that refuse to group, but never seen it myself.  In general you get most your honor/cp from the win'</div></div><hr />

Apparently Alliance don't look for teamwork as much as Horde.  Is this true on all servers?  I haven't done any PvP on Durotan....but I was part of a PvP server and have done WSG as Horde.</div></div><hr />

Alliance-heavy servers (like mine) will have longer queue times, and less organization. The Horde tends to have better organization, since they typically are dealing with being outnumbered. I would imagine the opposite would be true on a Horde-heavy server.</div></div><hr />

 This seems to be the way it goes on the azgalor sever also. Seems like alot of people just want to do their own thing. All they want are kills and whatever rep they can get, not caring if they win or lose. Its more noticable on a bonus weekend also when quick losses can still get you alot of CP's  :P</div></div><hr />

I think in WSG, alliance has only one once in any of the times I've been in there.  And that was because everyone one of the horde dropped out after their first capture (leaving the alliance like 5 minutes to cap twice for the win before the map closed).  I got tired of losing so I haven't been in in a while.<br />

If you join random groups in BG's there are always a couple a couple off ****-heads that only yell on ppl in general chat and behaving overall like idiots. This is not as common on horde side I've heard.<br />
Allthough, according to some horde players I've talked to, there are a lot of kids on the horde side that are impossible to get any sence out of and just answer direct questions with jibberish or smileys, this is not very common on alliance side.<br />
<br />
And another good thumb rule is, 90% of all paladin players are asshats that don't know **** and can't function with others at all.. 10% however are total opposite.. humble, level headed, polite and good leaders. Funny phenomenon really. :-p</div></div><hr />

We'd win half or better of AB. Now that i've hit 50s and almost 60, i see more ppl doing their own thing in WSG/AB. AV's just all screwed up - Horde hardly ever wins one :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as WSG / AB go, alliance pugs suck, plain and simple. The only ones that do good are the pvp guilds on my server who regularly go in and stomp horde pugs day in day out.</div></div><hr />

So far I have been able to play in 5 WSG matches and the we (alliance) have won every match.  It is extremely fun and on my server everyone works together quite well.  <br />

I would hate to be on a server where everyone does their own thing with no regard for the team.</div></div><hr />

I would go into a fight thinking I had 2 or 3 ppl w/ me only to find they would abandon me to go get the flag when they were holding the area right in front of the tunnel. I know it is off topic but can anyone post some winning tricks(be real specific on what you do please) that really help turn the battle?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways, with WSG I never had much luck with people actualy wanting to organize.  The few times we did, our group was so outnumbered compared to the Horde it wasn't even funny.<br />
<br />
AB I've had a bit more success, but nothing great.  A few wins, much more losses.<br />
<br />
I tried AV once and was 2 shotted so many times I just left ( that's right after I hit 50 ).<br />
<br />
Last night I was bored and figured I'd try again.  Wow, it was awesome.  People were broken into groups, one group was leading others were listening.  Each group had and assigned leader and people were actually working together.  We won, it rocked.  I couldn't believe how much fun I had.  I died...a lot, but I had a kick arse time.  Now, if it only didn't take so long ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cephlin</div><div class="date">03-12-2006, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main reason I find that horde tend to win is because alot of the newer people who play warcraft make a char on alliance sinse  they are kind of the &quot;goodies&quot; being human and all.  Therefore the ratio of good to bad players tends to wards bad more than on the horde.<br />
<br />
Thats just my opinnion, I am not saying that horde are better and that alliance are newbs or that alliance cant beat horde...</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I am PUG'ing it, it can be pretty disheartening.  I usually hold out and get into an organized group.  Then druids RULE in WSG.<br />
<br />
My server is about even horde / alliance.  So, organized ally groups beat horde pugs and vice versa.  About 50/50 with PUG vs PUG.<br />

One group I was with was so good we all joined up again 3 and didn't lose once.To get organized I usually talk to people who are willing to do WSG. After we talk strategy and who is in charge( I was for one match! :P) we go in and wait for the queue. Even though it might take a half-hour we usually go do other stuff while we wait. Sometimes I duel anyone in the group that I can to practice my solo skillz. When it comes time, we usuallyfight a bunch of disorganized hordies.One time we took a PvP guild and it came close(3-2). What I like is when we are evenly matched, that is when the fighting really begins(fighting for the middle is fun!). I dont join randomly though, we never get organized in time and get scrapped(I'm still not done with the sub-comments!). So,imo, depends on who you go in with and not your faction.</div></div><hr />
