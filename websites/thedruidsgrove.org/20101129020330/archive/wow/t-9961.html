Got into to work lastnight and this page nuked.  He added it to the restricted list on the proxy!  That damn old coot.  I hope he croaks.  Now I must seek other ways of getting here...you guys don't by chance have a secure side for this site do you?  I found out the official WoW site did, and so I get to browse there that way, if this site has a secure link I can still get here, and I still have my cookies so I won't have to worry about logging in.  Hrm...I could do proxy, but the old fart has a blanket over the word proxy period.  Can't even do a search with the word in it without getting the blocked banner!  :behindcom <br />
<br />
Hrm...must think of a new strategy...........I expect some answers!  Oh and I did try the google translation thing as well...somehow even blocked sites still show up blocked when trying to use the translater....=(</div></div><hr />
