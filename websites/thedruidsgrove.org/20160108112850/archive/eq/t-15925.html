I accidently handed Foloal the softly glowing stone before killing Venril so I do not have his gem yet.  Since this can be MQ'd, can I still finish this portion by killing Venril and turning in his stone, or do I need to start over?<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The old quests do not flag your character with each handin.  Its the NPCs that react to what is given to them.<br />
 <br />
I think currently in your case, Foloal is waiting to be given a VS Stone.  When he receives it, he will give out whatever the next item is, to whoever gives him the VS Stone.<br />
 <br />
Now, its been a while, but i think he will stay in that state untill a server/zone reset.<br />
 <br />
You could risk handin him a stone and hope nobody else has handed him anything since your accidental handin.<br />

GL, with whatever you decide to do.</div></div><hr />
