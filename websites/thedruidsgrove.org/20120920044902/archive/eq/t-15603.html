 <br />
I am a 63 Druid who is finding it difficult to find my level 63-65 spells. I dive into the Bazaar daily, and have only found Shield of Bracken and Swarming Death.<br />
 <br />
I know these spells are the result of PoP quests and need a spectral parchment turn in to acquire.<br />
 <br />
The issue is WHERE to hunt for them. I have done the dive into Alla's and know all the zones that they can be found in. The issue is which zones are appropriate for the levels and classes of my group, don't require a raid force to get into, and provide the best chance to get a spectral parchment.<br />
 <br />
My group consists of the following:<br />
 <br />
63 Druid (me)<br />
62 Monk<br />
61 Warrior (me)<br />
61 Warrior (my wife)<br />
59 Beastlord<br />
59 Ranger<br />
 <br />
At some point, the Ranger and the Beastlord may want these parchments also for their spells.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance for your help!<br />

 <br />
The critical spells to get are really the heal spells.  Since I am the main tank also, I have noted that even though I am heavily AA'd with the defensive AA's appropriate for my level, and well geared, the damage mobs are doing at these levels is starting to outstrip the ability of Chloroblast and Tunare's Renewal to keep up with easily.<br />
 <br />
In truth, my Druid functions as a low-rent Cleric in this group, with some buffing, debuffing and the occasional DOT thrown in...<br />
 <br />
Oh yeah... and the Succor trump card too!  :wiggle:</div></div><hr />

Way back when I want to say most of my Spectrals came from Bastion of Thunder, but they are pretty uncommon from even there.<br />
<br />
I remember Halls of Honor also dropped them uncommonly, as well as Tactics.<br />
<br />
Since your group is unable to access any of these areas, you will either need to level to 62+ or in the case of Tactics, do the Ebleam quest in Storms.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm...<br />
 <br />
What about Torment?<br />
 <br />
Is that manageable with the group described?  Lordy, can the group even get in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can zone into Torment, since your entire group is over 55.<br />
<br />
Torment sucks for other reasons, the birds Silence if I recall, and there are random spider traps on the walkways.  I never exped here, so I can't comment on the drop rate.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Well, having researched it some more, this might be my only viable option unless there are other suggestions.<br />
 <br />
From my reading, Silence lasts for 3 ticks max. The issue will be if I can somehow keep the mob far enough away from the Druid with the tank so that he is out of range when it goes off... or maybe resist it... to keep the tank alive with heals.<br />
 <br />
Regardless, even this zone might require that I get the main tank a couple more levels.<br />
 <br />
Cripes, I'm stumped for better options here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your group was a higher average level, more options would open up to you.<br />
<br />
Additionally, PoP-era spells have been researchable for quite a while now, so you could likely have the spells you needed made for you.</div></div><hr />

Resist it?<br />
<br />
Forget that.  I'm a level 75 druid with magic resist of 499 and the other day I was there and didn't resist it.<br />
<br />
If I can't, you can't.<br />
<br />
(If you check my magelo, you see it says my magic resist is 439 but I always use my clicky mask for +50 and my ring for +10, which equals 499, I'm not sure if I had any spell buff on me at the time, so I just used 499)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
You can out range it, but then you'd have a high chance of being hit with it if you were healing with TR, which I believe is the issue your having in the first place?<br />
<br />
I suppose you could fight around corners, but it means your Druid isn't doing much other then buffing and healing any time a raven pull is incoming.<br />
<br />
The Ravens suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tobynn</div><div class="date">03-10-2007, 05:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hobgoblin caves in Nightmare were a fairly reliable source of spectrals back in the day.  Picked up a lot of spells from bullyrag bats, agony mephits and also some breed of hobgoblin I don't recall which.<br />
<br />
As I remember, those specific mobs always dropped a loot item or a spell.  We had piles of loots rot on these mobs, gloves and arms and masks and earrings left and right while we accumulated spells.  The mobs always always dropped something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also ... These spells are available via research now.   Might want to inquire of some high volume spell traders in bazaar, chances are good they are crafting spells.  Might be able to negotiate yourself some package deals on spells made to order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kagonis</div><div class="date">03-10-2007, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quad-kite in the basement of Halls of Honor.. I think it's the NW basement that always have 4 snareable guards. It's decent XP up to level 65, it gives you Hero Parts either to sell in bazaar or use yourself for baking, and it gives both Ethereal and Spectral Parchments, add to it all that it also gives a decent amount of cash.. I got so many Parchments kiting there that I usually destroyed them all..<br />
<br />
65 Spells you can only get through runes, which only drop from bosses. You'd have a better chance of buying those in Bazaar or having  a Researcher making them for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hexes</div><div class="date">03-12-2007, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welp, I paid to have them researched...<br />
 <br />
Or, more correctly, I paid to have the important ones researched. There are still some I am missing, but I got Po9, the heals and Legacy of the Bracken (along with others...), through level 65.<br />
 <br />
At some point, the Ranger and Beastlord in my normal group will need their spells, and will most likely not be able to pony up a good chunk of plat to get them, so we'll try the grouping method.<br />
 <br />
Besides, I'm bored to tears with doing the Hate's Fury and Unrest instances and need a change.<br />
 <br />
Can anyone confirm the parchments still drop in the Hobgoblin caves in Nightmare?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
First go to POStorm to kill giants to get your faction up (if a group is killing named for flags you can tag along to get faction hits). Then go to the sand area of POS to kill diaku's. There are 4 of them, each carry one corner of the turn in piece (mobs have the same name but are different calsses, so you may need to kill more than 4 to get the whole set). The killing and factioning don't need the whole group, just enough people to get the job done (druids can even solo them). Once you collected the whole set, gather your group to do turn in. The whole group gets the flag to Tactics. Only the turn in person needs a good faction (enough to get the task from Wembly the Forlorn ). If MQ by two people then both need good faction. <br />
 <br />
Ordinary mobs in the pit should be an easy kill. Named are difficult at your levels, and be careful of the stempede.</div></div><hr />
