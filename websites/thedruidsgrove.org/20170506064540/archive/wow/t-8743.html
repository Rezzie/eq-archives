<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jarkun</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm lvl29 &amp; starting to figure out how I like to play. I love my feral forms &amp; shifting out to cast spells is the cats-meow. But I'm having trouble understanding the play-style that benefits from swift-shifting.<br />
<br />
from what I understand swiftshifting reduces the cost of going feral-&gt;druid-&gt;feral by 20-60%. That going into a feral form uses 25% of your total mana. So the net benefit is you reduce the cost of going feral-&gt;druid-&gt;feral from 25% t  20/15/10% of your total mana, IF and only IF you do it within 6 seconds. Basically enough time to cast two or three decent spells if you don't get interupted.<br />
<br />
Now this all sounds great...but since you regen mana while in feral form when does it really make a difference? If I only have time to shift out, heal &amp; then shift back it seems like I always should have enough mana. Are the reduced costs really worth it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">04-28-2005, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Swiftshifting is a really good talent.  A couple of good ways to take advantage of that are..<br />
<br />
1.  When in bear form, bash (hopefully you have imp bash) shift into caster, regrow/rejuv, shift back into bear.<br />
<br />
2.  When in any form, shift into caster, nature swiftness, regrow/rejuv, shift into form.<br />
<br />
Even w/o nature swiftness, you should have sufficient time to get at least one heal off and get back into form.  <br />
<br />
Bear form and healing is my favorite combo.  You can deal decent damage, take lots of hits, and restore yourself to new in just a few seconds.  <br />
<br />
Later down the road if you decide to get involved in PvP, you will see the need to conserve mana due to long drawn out fights and or big instances battles.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceyne</div><div class="date">04-29-2005, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For PvE, swiftswitching is useful, but arguably not critical. Especially if you favour groups over solo.  As you solo more, swiftswitching can give you more mana in a fight and let you tackle harder baddies as you save tremendous amounts of mana with bear/healing tactics.  Some fights against elites can go for 15 minutes as judicious use of your talents keeps you alive against otherwise impossible odds.<br />
<br />
For PvP, swiftswitching is mandatory.  Every time a mass of Alliance is chasing you (or just one dogged hunter), you will get slowed, or frozen, or rooted.  To break this, you need to come out of your form and then back in.  Repeat three or four times to get out of range, and you're helpless.  With swiftswitching, you can return to the fight.  This scenario happens incredibly often, and without this skill you are seriously impacting your combat effectiveness.<br />

With my druid though, when i solo i like swiftshifting because you can prowl, ravage, gain 5 combo points then do a full Rip, shift to bear and finish off the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">05-31-2005, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've thought about this.  Usually, going in/out/in of bearform is something that would only happen once in a PvE fight for me - and that would be rare.<br />
<br />
In Battlegrounds (I've tested Warsong Gulch), I can see it being a benefit.  However, when outdoor, I always go travel form to break root/snare.  It's only 200ish mana.<br />
<br />
Would you take swiftshifting over 3 points in Imp Wrath or Imp Moonfire at level 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mekell</div><div class="date">05-31-2005, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use swift shift to lower the mana cost of bear form which gets to be costly at high levels. Switch to travel and then to bear for a cheaper overall mana cost (atleast it sure seems that way, maybe my head is playing tricks on me). I will do the math later tonite to see for sure</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">06-01-2005, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont use it. But saving mana is always good. But if you havent got innervate (but you probably do) use thoose 3 points to get closer to that instead. Now we're talking more mana!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mekell</div><div class="date">06-01-2005, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah my setup is 8/12/31, so with swiftshift combined with innervate, i rarely rarely ever have to stop to regen mana hehe. Currently being level 47 (almost 48 woo!), my setup is 7/0/31. Until 40 i had swiftshift, and then at 40 i specced to innervate, and am working back towards swiftshift (now i have 2 points of it, man i missed it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider putting two more points into balance with Nature's Reach.  Leave Swiftshifting at 2 points.  Then go down the feral tree and get two points in Improved Bash and a point in Feral Charge.  Awesome build.</div></div><hr />
