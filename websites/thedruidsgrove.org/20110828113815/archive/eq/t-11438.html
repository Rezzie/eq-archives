 <br />
I just got to level 64 after a long bout of grinding xp and I've realized that my gear, which was once pretty good for a level 55, is no longer in line with my character's level.<br />
 <br />
I don't have tons of time to play consistently so I can't really join a raiding guild. Therefore I was wondering if you guys could take a look at my Magelo and offer me up some suggestions on quests or npc's i can kill solo to upgrade my stuff. I'm willing to try risky things as long as there's actually a chance I can succeed.<br />
 <br />
I'd prefer things I can solo as its hard for me to get people to come along with me without offering them something in return because the family guild I am in is almost completely inactive, but I'd like to stay there until I have the time to join a raiding guild...so again, solo things preferred.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for the time and thoughts. <br />
 <br />
:crazy: <br />

P.S. My Magelo link is in my sig.</div></div><hr />

May take you a long time to get it tho, as its a random, rare drop.  Took me a month after it was first linked to me, but to be fair most of the time i spent there was in groups.  <br />
 <br />
If that sort of &quot;camping the rare&quot; is your thing, there's a really nice ring, Fractured Obsidian Band (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26061) that i tried on and off to get for a month or so.  Just don't expect good exp from these even though they could kill me (and have) in a max quad, because their hp is on par with vxed mobs.<br />
 <br />
If camping stuff like that isn't your bag, then I dunno.  Most of my stuff is from the baz- just loot junk and try to push it for pp and buy upgrades, its not too hard to do on bristlebane.  Takes the fun outta the game, yes, but that's why i play my ranger more and more.</div></div><hr />

Of course, your would need to group for those.  They are usually done in under an hour.  If you plan on grouping at all, I would get an item improving your healing.  You can either buy ornate sleeves - or DoN offers some healing augs.<br />
 <br />
If you have a ton of cash, a search in the bazaar will find you a ton of great items with 100hps/100manna ++.  If you don't, I recommend the DoN route.  Sony does encourage us to group!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">noirblood</div><div class="date">05-31-2005, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the quick tips OK.<br />
 <br />
Are those Barindu mobs snare/rootable? If so that and the NC shield are great ideas. Thanks a lot!<br />
 <br />
Keep em comin... :wiggle: <br />
<br />
As for DoN's, I do em when I can, but I'm looking for things that I can solo occasionally/during downtime. Thanks anyway Penasi.<br />
 <br />
And I definitely do not have a ton of cash :smoke2: <br />

And by doing so ignores a big chunk of our versatility, but that's prob for another thread.<br />
 <br />
If you can get groups, DoN and certain OoW spots are good. Maybe try DS instances, stat augs drop randomly there, and some of the named drops are cool. And its fun to do, even if you're just farming a named spot, as wanderers and spawns happen a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">okthisnameplz</div><div class="date">05-31-2005, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The nocs are not snarable/rootable.  I've never had anything summon me in barindu.  The spot I like to camp is at the ent to vxed, in that canyon.  No wanderers there, easy singles, and enough room to run around and reroot as needed.  All the mobs that pop there are snarable and don't summon; some are bsts tho, and have pets, so you'll have two things to root rot, but not too hard to do.  I haven't tried it yet, as I just thought of it:  try harmony on the pets.  I believe they looked kos at me before i aggroed the owner.  Most pets, even for stuff you're kos to, look indiff at you.  It might have its own aggro thread.  If not, just be rdy =)</div></div><hr />

You can ensnare and root/rot these mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rainan</div><div class="date">06-02-2005, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you could solo in Vxed and hope to get the very rare random mask drop, its pretty nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaminide</div><div class="date">06-03-2005, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Do the OoW tier1 armour quests<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2975<br />
<br />
If you solo/group a lot, you could get the faction and the drops are quite common.<br />
<br />
2) if you can get yourself KT flagged (lvl 69+M2) try the access quests which are solo/groupable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Little Rhunt</div><div class="date">06-03-2005, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another angle on this strategy is to solo tradeable items to sell, which allow you to go shopping for upgrades.  Then there are tradeskills you can work on, soloing for ingrediants, to use/sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">06-05-2005, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other reason to kill in NC would be the murkglider cloak quest.  kill murks until you get 4 sword pieces to turn in for a very nice ID5 cloak.  You still have chances at the rare zone wide shield and belts dropping as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Etana</div><div class="date">06-05-2005, 06:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As suggested, go to Noble Causeway and kill murkglieders at trench close to Dranik Scar. You get good xp, they are easy and a lot of space to snare/root. If you are there long enough you will eventually get the zone random drops Foresight Sash (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30506) and Drakescale Shield (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30592). Also might have chance to get some good selling drops to buy yourself some upgrades. Collect the 4 pieces for this quest Zakariv's Shattered Sword (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2966) to get Woven Cape of the Militia (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=32093). <br />
<br />
Get to know the zone well - there is a great write-up on this board Noble's Causeway Guide (http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=10283). You can ooc lfg or if any drops rotting, so can get some other upgrades from named. For quest you need Dranik Loyalist faction, so after collecting the 4 pieces from the murks, you can go to the other side of zone close to WoS and kill dragorns for faction and they drop the zone random stuff also. For faction also camp in Dranik Scar Ukun Gutfeaster for  Dull Stone of Sorrow (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=30528) and Ukun Slavehunter for Eye of the Dragorn (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=31700). Faction is very difficult to raise though.<br />
<br />
When camps are taken, you can try Barindu for Fractured Obsidian Band (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=26061) (i didnt manage to get that one myself yet). <br />
<br />
And of course, check bazaar for cheap upgrades. Dont know how it is on other servers but on AB some common drops from oow named have become pretty cheap and might be of interest for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robart</div><div class="date">02-11-2008, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are the murkglieders solable by a level 63 druid with ghetto gear?  I'm just returning to the game after a few years and would like to pick up some exp while doing 1-3 hour log ons.  Is that guard near the Dranik's Scar zone in any trouble?<br />
<br />
I'm a little leary of these 3 year old threads because I'm not sure if much has changed in that time.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help or strategy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttercups</div><div class="date">03-01-2008, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes they should be, I kite the Murks at zone in with my 61 Necro. Snare is resisted sometimes as is Poison (almost all ways), The Murks are DB to White for me, are social, SoW will out run them, I have been hit for as much as 300, are rootable and paying attention to repops easily singled pulled.<br />
<br />
So with the 14 minute snare, the murks will be your lunch, There are not enough to make quad kiting an attractive option, to much sit time, and the trench is a bit narrow.<br />
<br />
When NC was a hot zone I was making 11% aa per white and 9% per DB.<br />
<br />
When I'm 60 I'll try NC also<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damas</div><div class="date">03-02-2008, 06:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dragonscale hills has some nice drops as well. may not be able to solo there but not hard to get group at farm or something. And depending on cash you may be able to pick these items up in bazaar. Now a longer suggestion is to try and solo serpents in katta castrum. There cpl quests you can do at once and there usually a grp there you can try to get into. Granted getting ally will take some time but nice armor you can get.</div></div><hr />

With Mire Thorns and Glamour of Tunare you might be able to solo the bears in Icefall. If not check out who is killing them and try to get in their group or loot 8 quest pelts from the bears, to get 2 x 220mana bracers. <br />
<br />
Work the Wraithguard faction (the quest above) a bit more with killing mammoths for Ivory and you can solo the Shield quest at the zone in, in Frostcrypt. Check alla for details, but basically set a hot key to 'stop' and spam the npc with it. Once the bad guy pops, dot it snare it nuke it and stay out the way of it and pray you get it dead before it kills the npc. Sadly the shield isnt useable til 75 though.</div></div><hr />
