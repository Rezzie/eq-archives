When Hydross goes from one form to another, does a druid's HoT generate aggro to the druid?  Or does it forget the origin of the HoT during that transition.  I know that unaggro'd mobs don't know who cast a HoT when you have one running on a tank, just wondering if Hydross works like that too.<br />
<br />
So the real question is, are HoTs going to be a problem on this fight?</div></div><hr />

With all other ( druid ) hots the healing aggro is applied to the caster. <br />
<br />
His phase change wipes his aggro table, and that's while you don't want a lot of hots up then since it will head for the caster instead of the tank trying to build aggro</div></div><hr />

Here is my $0.02 on the fight:<br />
<br />
Strategies say to Swiftmend your HoTs and let Lifeblooms expire before the transition, because you do build aggro on Hydross for HoT ticks after the transition.  In theory, it's a great idea.  In practice, if the tank is approaching low and you know that Hydross still has two or three swings left, you can't stop healing.  Sure, you may end up with a HoT or two on the non-active tank after the transition.  But, frankly, I've never had a problem with that.  It does only turn out to be about a thousand threat (or so) in the first five seconds of the transition, which should be easily, EASILY covered by the tank who is picking Hydross up.<br />
<br />
If you're unsure about your tank, just cross the water/poison line and keep healing anyway.  (A dead healer is better than a dead tank.)  Then find a new tank.</div></div><hr />
