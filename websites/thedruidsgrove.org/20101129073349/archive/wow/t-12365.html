Researched the whole aerial dunk, dive strategy on plenty of sites, but in standard flight form (I'm not an epic bird yet) I don't know how to dunk or dive or swoop or swirl - I just....fly.  <br />
<br />
To complete this quest, I stealth in, morph into flight form, click my bomb, and travel form outta' there.  It's sloppy, but it works.  However, it takes FOREVER.  <br />
<br />
So teach me birdies!  How do I dunk or dive or whatever I need to do to be able to complete this in standard flight form?</div></div><hr />

It takes a bit of practice, but if you make liberal use of approaching, using space bar to shift you up and then drop the bomb and turn and use space bar you should be ok.  I will admit its hard in normal flight form.</div></div><hr />

- Hold whatever button you would normally hold to turn in place.<br />
- At the same time, hold the space bar<br />
<br />
To climb, while holding forward hold the space bar.<br />
<br />
Good luck! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
To expand on this, what I did is fly up and angle myself towards my target (so you're on a downward slope) and drop your bomb and hit space bar and once you get the hang of it, you'll feel like a hawk or whatever.<br />
<br />
Make use of your Strafe Left and Strafe Right buttons too imo.</div></div><hr />

The Fel Cannons always shoot where you are going to be if you continue along your present course.  To avoid them, just stop and start and change direction a lot.<br />

Wow!  What - A - Difference.<br />

Swift Flight Form + Bombing Run = Cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avearis</div><div class="date">02-05-2008, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The two strategies that have been listed here that have really served me well are angling down using the space bar to adjust altitude, and turning often. Before I went epic, I usually aimed to the side of the target on approach, then turned just in time to drop the bomb. If you start out aiming directly for your target you will either have to alter course or be shot down. This way you can alter course directly for your target.<br />
<br />
There is one down side to having epic flight form during bombing runs- during Fires Over Skettis, I used to keep Autorun pressed and drop the bombs as I flew over the eggs. In epic form, if I do that, I'm out of range before the bomb lands. Small price to pay for my favorite druid ability of all time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kauroth</div><div class="date">02-06-2008, 01:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of my choice quotes:<br />
<br />
&quot;Where'd he go? Where'd who go?&quot;<br />
&quot;Jester's Dead.&quot;<br />
&quot;Gonna hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.&quot;<br />
&quot;That's right! Ice... man. I am dangerous.&quot;<br />
&quot;That son of a bitch cut me off!&quot;<br />
&quot;This is what I call a target rich environment.&quot;<br />
&quot;I feel the need......the need for speed! &quot;<br />
&quot;Great balls of fire!&quot;<br />
<br />
All of these quotes work so much better if you're questing with someone and they have their own loaded up.</div></div><hr />
