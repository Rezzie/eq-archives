<br />
She wants to play WoW. <br />
<br />
The gameplay is much too complicated for her, and she's just learning to read.<br />
<br />
Wondering if anyone else has played any of the Hello Kitty games.<br />
<br />
I don't know what came over me, but I ended up getting her a Sanrio Town email account and submitting it to try and get a Founder's Account. <br />
<br />
We were successful.  She now has a Hello Kitty Online (HKO) founder's account and will be able to participate in the Beta.<br />
<br />
Hoping it'll be a little easier for her than WoW...and it should be fairly similar.  It's an MMORPG with a lot of the same characteristics as WoW (gear, quests, new areas, etc)...<br />
<br />
Just...curious about it...Looking to hear what you guys have to say about it.<br />
<br />
and yes...LOL @ ME for this...I have been since I got the @hellokitty.com email address:banghead: <br />
<br />
:twak: Can hardly wait to hear what you hardcore, tough druids have to say about something so ADORABLE!!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't let my children play WoW before they are at least 14. Mainly because I think it would be a bad influence, interacting with adults that do know how young the person is they are talking with. Also because it can be so addicting.<br />
<br />
And because in my experience young players really pose a problem in a community that consists mainly of older players (at least that is the case on my server), because they often cannot fulfill the expectations put upon them.<br />
<br />
Well, call me old-fashioned, but that is what I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figured that'd be easier for her than WoW.  I'm finding, through some research, that it's another game that teens and adults play as well, but a lot less vicious than WoW can be I hope.  <br />
<br />
We have a founders account for HKO, so I'm going to see what it's all about.  We'll see how this goes...</div></div><hr />
