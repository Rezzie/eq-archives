I see the arch being the arch of a doorway, with the line to the right of the base leading to a 4-pronged fork, and the line to the left of the base leading to a swirl. Now, here's my revelation: the 4-pronged fork stands for the 4 elemental planes, the arch is the doorway/gateway, and the swirl is the infinity known as the plane of time. Perhaps we are looking for a sign of nature or some druidic symbol that resides in the barren zone known as the Plane of Innovation. I havn't had the time to search around there myself, but it's a lead.<br />

[Thu Dec 02 22:02:18 2004] The worn Taelosian looks up at you discretely, as if looking at you directly would cause physical pain.  She shyly hands you a small, worn bag and what appears to be an animal fang.  She then holds up six fingers and points at the fang, then points at herself.  She then turns quickly away and proceeds to act as if you are not there.</div></div><hr />

*handed Rune to historian*<br />
[Fri Dec 03 05:14:39 2004] Historian Finrazel says 'Well, this is an amazing find!  I didn't think any of his runes survived the invasion.' The historian cleans the rune with a special solution, then hands it back to you. 'Let me tell you what I know of Yuisaha.  He was a great rain spirit, perhaps the greatest patron of the Taelosians.  He was manifested when the Muramites invaded Talosia so long ago.  He was captured by the army and brought back to the Plane of Discord.  What happened to Yuisaha then is hard to say, but there is a separate story of a powerful rain spirit that was frozen during a battle and shattered.  The story claims that the frozen shards of the spirit were divided among the leaders of the winning army.  Where they have gone since then, or if they still exist, nobody can tell.  Do you really [plan to find] him?'<br />

'I hope so, anyway.  I don't exactly see a lot of frozen rain spirits.' He smiles. 'I wish you luck, friend.  Rescuing such a being would be a boon for all of Norrath.'</div></div><hr />

Rumor #1 (not confirmed yet)<br />
The frost shard and wind shard mini-quests to spawn a mob in Walls of Slaughter has NOT been confirmed if indeed it is or is not part of our epic 2.0 quest.<br />
The Frost Shard drops from a named in Nobles Causeway called: Bazu Scavenger that can be dispatched by a single small group. We still don't know where the Wind Shard drops.</div></div><hr />

If you have the correct faction you get the rune fragment right away but if you don't you get to do the side quest.<br />

Regarding the pulsing frozen heart, it's small so it WOULD fit in the leather bag.  Could be one of the 4 items.</div></div><hr />

The commander then came out and said they had become a burden to him and Mata Muram and how they weren't pleased.  Then told them to take up their posts and he wandered back to spawn spot.<br />

I threw myself at the guards in the interests of science and they squished me pretty quick.  Both hit in the range 1200-1500 although I was only self buffed and didn't last too many hits. Didn't notice any spells or AE's.<br />

No, the spell Mind Warp (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5808&amp;source=Live) isn't quite the same at the Quarm one (Time Warp (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4026&amp;source=live)), Mind Warp has two cancel magic's in there too.<br />
<br />
Let's make a suitable leap of faith and assume Mind Warp comes from Spiritlord Mind, and make an equally suitable leap of faith that Spiritlord Body casts Body Warp (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5809&amp;source=live).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nanoq MajicBlade</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, Regarding the Mastruq Commander Gorlakt and his two body guards, Spiritlord Mind and Spiritlord Body.  WE DID THIS EVENT in BETA (sorry for the Caps...got excited after checking my Betalog).  Just prior to the event, somone in the raid (yes, it took a RAID to do this in Beta), somone made the offhand comment that it might be for Epic 2.0 (no class specified, though).  Anyway, this was a test of choice for us, in that you had to pick which guard to attack.  What happens is, when you kill one guard, his ability (Mindwarp, or Bodywarp, depending on which guard you chose to kill first) is transferred to the Commander, thus making him harder to kill.  Here is the gist of the event.<br />
<br />
You must kill one guard before engaging Commander.  Each guard has a AE..Spiritlord Mind= Debuff AE...Spiritlord Body=Lifetap AE.  Kill one and Commander is attackable but gets the AE the dead guard had.  In Beta, the guards were tethered, not sure about live.  The AE's were resistable, also (prismatic).  Both Spiritlords hit for around 1500 and were splitable.  Rahtiz (GM) said he might change this before Live.<br />
<br />
We engaged Spiritlord Mind first.  The Debuff AE landed sporadically...we noticed that it also slowed our cast time...not good, but RGC cured Mindwarp.   Spiritlord Mind went down pretty fast.<br />
<br />
Next, Mastruq Commander Gorkakt:  While Spiritlord Body was offtanked (his lifetap was in the 500 range but expect it to be more in live encounter), we engaged.  <br />
Commander hit for about 2800 and using the AE Debuff made this event pretty tough.  Rahtiz poofed the Commander midfight.<br />
<br />
We then switched up for next encounter and chose Spiritlord Body to take down first figuring we could handle a 500 lifetap every 30 seconds from the Commander.  This went real smooth as the Lifetap was interrupted quite alot so was pretty much ineffective.<br />
<br />
Mastruq Commander next:  Commander's inherited Lifetap (Bodywarp) appeared to be changed to a single target Lifetap (bug?...never found out...it it was, it will be fixed).  He Rampages.  Late in the battle, Slow became harder to land, but we were able to kill him relatively easy with our raidforce.  We commented that this event was way to easy for the power we had (all level 70).  Rahtiz assured us that the event would be tuned for the appropriate raidforce and level<br />
<br />
One final note:  Commander had loot...however, Rahtiz poofed the corpse before anyone could check it...We now know why.<br />

 <br />
We started of by pulling his 2x a nervous guards wich were no trouble whatsoever. After they died we charged &quot;a retired soldier&quot; who now had a new name: Lightning lord. He summons lightning loyalists that comes roaming the same way we used when entering &quot;a retired soldiers&quot; room. in other words, they come from behind and was quite a nasty surprise when you are not expecting it. they were 3 at first but then another 2 or 3 added aswell. Immune to snare/root and max hit on me was 1061.<br />
We tryed to burn down the lightning lord as we saw his life dropped pretty fast. However when we reached 10%-15% he CHed himself and more lightning loyalists arrived so we had to evac.</div></div><hr />

We were unable to split pull them so we had 2 tanks take them down (very little hpand can be shaman slow'd), and we killed them at same time.  Then Retired Soldier turned into Lightning Lord.  After engage, he spawned about 4 Lighting Loyalists (can be shaman slowed).  We didnt try to mez them, just had tanks on all of them, when the Lord got to about 20% he called upon his &quot;little guys&quot; and they healed him.. So we took out the loyalists and then the Lord.  Lord Droped  :  Rain Shard<br />
 <br />
Overall was very easy fight, and imo we had overkill, but we weren't really knowing what to expect.</div></div><hr />

WoS definitely easier than Qinimi encounter. Recieved Rain shard, which combined into a Synched Leather Bag. Handed it to Historian Finrazel and got this response:<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Historian Finrazel opens the bag and examines the shards with care and awe. He then seals them back into the bag and returns it to you. 'Well, isn't that a sight to behold. I'm grateful to you for letting me see them. It appears that the stories were correct. My guess would be that those shards were given to various Muramite leaders as rewards for some particularly horrible work they had done. I hope you can find a way to make those pieces whole again. I wish I could help you, but you've already exceeded the bounds of my knowledge. I wish you luck finding someone to help you restore the rain spirit shards.<br />

<br />
Head to Abysmal Sea and speak with Silanda Leafdew<br />
<br />
You say, 'How can I restore these rain spirit shards?'<br />
<br />
Silanda Leafdew says 'I'm not sure that I understand what you mean by rain spirit shards.  Can you show them to me?  I'll need to see all of them.'<br />
<br />
Give her your Synched Satchel<br />
<br />
Silanda Leafdew says 'Well, this shouldn't be too hard.  These pieces want to be rejoined.  I suppose all you really need is a good source of reliable cold to help the pieces mend together and a cool place to put them while that happens.  Once you have the pieces together you'll need a source constant heat to revive the spirit.  The frozen spirit and the heat will need a warm place to sit for a while.  You could probably use one good insulated container for both tasks.  Here, let me show you what I mean.'  Silanda sketches a drawing on a pieces of rough parchment and hands it to you. 'You'll want to have that made out of the clay the Taelosians used to make their stone workers.'' <br />
<br />
You receive: Insulated container sketch (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62875) <br />
<br />
As she mentions, you will need to make an insulated container using taelosian clay.  Combine a clump of refined ancient taelosian clay with the sketch in a kiln to create: Insulated container (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62876) <br />
<br />
Next, you need to meld your rain spirit back together again using this container and a source of reliable cold. This cold comes in the form of a Pulsing Frozen Heart (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62877) found in Velketor's Labyrinth off of Experiments.  <br />
<br />
Combining your Synched Leather bag + Pulsing frozen heart = Frozen rain spirit (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=62878) <br />
<br />
As Silanda alludes to, we now need a source of reliable heat to revive the spirit.</div></div><hr />

A few things on this step:<br />
1) Wurm spawned for me while  I was running  along the northern edge of BW, at approximately p3000, 0.  I was running so this could be a little off the true  trigger point.  He then spawns North, Northwest of the giant fort.<br />
<br />
2) He is immune to melee attacks... lol<br />
<br />
3) epic 1.5 + fire + frozen rain spirit = DNC<br />
<br />
4) the limb serves as a character flag - you cannot respawn the wurm without first  banking the limb on a corpse or destroying it.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps.<br />
<br />
I suppose all you really need is a good source of reliable cold to help the pieces mend together and a cool place to put them while that happens.<br />
Was the Pulsing Frozen Heart combinable in a zone that wasn't cold?<br />

If the Heart combine could be done anywhere, it would be logical that the fire could as well</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem with the line of thought that since the first combine worked anywhere the second should as well is the result of the combine might be completely different.. the first just got you an item, the 2nd might actually summon an npc like I believe is done with the scout for the bic quest.   In which case it might be limited based on zones not having the needed model.<br />
 <br />
I think though we are looking for a third item (possibly a large one) since it would seem odd to have 3 slots for the container when you only use 2 for both combines.  Along the same lines but to a lesser exent the box hasn't taken any large items yet but does have the capacity for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some thoughts on our current step.<br />
 <br />
I've ran around trying any zone that I remotely thought could be considered 'warm' for the combine of Frozen Rain Spirit and Everburning Jagged Tree Limb.  Zones I remember trying: PoFire, Sol Ro, Lavastorm, SolB, SolC, Tim Deep, Skyfire, BW, VP, Oasis, Sro and probably some others.  When doing our combine for epic 1.5 does anyone happen to remember what happens when we try combining somewhere other than Feerrot?  Text we get when trying to combine Frozen Rain Spirit is &quot;You cannot combine these items in this container type!&quot;.  If the mangled head combine of 1.5 didn't do the same thing then zone probably has nothing to do with it.  On the other hand if the mangled head did give us the same cannot combine text then trying to combine in more zones may be worth our time.  Also, the mangled head had to be combined at a certain spot in zone, good chance that the Frozen Rain Spirit would need to be at an exact spot too making it a lot tougher to find unless we find an npc that gives a hint...  Areas that we've been at before for epic 1.5 and 2.0 might be places to try since the mangled head was at the same place we killed Swamp Terror.<br />
 <br />
Next possibility like Mellen stated we may need a third item.  I've been carrying around the Everburning Oil and trying it in different zones also.  Doesn't fit in since it's no where near our Lucy IDs for quest but hey anything's possible.  There might be another 'spawner' to get the 3rd piece similar to crippled wurm, but I'm doubting it's spawned.  My guess is if we're looking for 1 more heat source it's going to be off of some obscure mob that has PHs and has a crap spawn rate like Velketor's Experiments.  Just staying in line with the quest and amount of hints it actually gave where the cold source would come from.  Another possibility could be that we're ready for the Globe of Discordant Energy.  When I think of energy I think heat.  Problem with this is we got no hint at all that we're to go to Anguish yet most other classes seem to have gotten a hint from their NPCs to go to anguish when it was time for them to get the globe.  (Rant: As I read through enchanter and warrior epic 2.0s it tells them the exact zone to go to and the exact mob to look for.  &quot;Go kill Cipheron&quot; &quot;Go kill withered murkglider&quot; &quot;Go to the labyrinth zone (pg) and find a possessed being&quot;  I would like to thank the person who created our quest for being as vague as possible compared to others.)  So considering they got clear cut hints on most things compared to ours the globe could be an option still.<br />
 <br />
If we go by Lucy IDs I think there's only 4 IDs left, one of the 4 will be 2.0.  Another might be whatever the result from combining the Frozen Rain Spirit with our heat source (or we may spawn the spirit and it gives us a new container).  We could have an intermediate step where we get an epic 1.75 also, just like warriors got a different version of their 1.5 til they finished 2.0.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drithius</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you do a combine in an incorrect zone, you would get no DNC message but rather your items would simply be eaten.<br />
<br />
It seems you cannot trigger crippled wurm a second time if you carry the limb already.  This gives credence to there being a character flag associated with the item in particular not just the container it is placed in.  So, any old zones checked before acquiring the limb need to be rechecked (for trigger mobs I mean).<br />
<br />
Also, one thing that's been bugging me is what Leafdew says, or rather what she does not say: Once you have the pieces together you'll need a source constant heat to revive the spirit.   This is a typo obviously and most would  assume there's just a missing 'of' but what if there's an entire phrase left out which would have pointed us in the direction of the third component.  It's been bugging me.<br />
<br />
With all that stated, and after a couple days of handing the limb/spirit to npc's and criss-crossing several zones, I'm beginning to think our third component may just be the globe.  :shuffle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yeraie</div><div class="date">12-08-2004, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Re the Discordant Globe: Kaidman is correct in that it has been very clear to other classes when the orb was required. I'd be surprised (and disappointed, frankly) if we've reached the globe step at this point in our quest...we've really had no significant raid events, where other classes have had at least one. We've also had no clear indication that it's needed next, though Kaidman's energy idea is interesting. <br />
 <br />
I believe we have another step. As Mellen said, the 3 slot box is a 'large' container, and nothing we've seen so far is large (orb is tiny btw). We either need a 3rd item now, though Silandra gives no indication of needing anything else to revive, or there may be a further use for the container after we revive the Rain fella, one that requires a large size slot.<br />
 <br />
As for a possible site specific combine, in the 1.5 quest we had clear instructions to combine the mangled head at that spot. On the other hand, rangers had to do a site specific combine and their only clue was that it was in a forest. They spawned a tree in JP that grew and gave them info as to what to do next. <br />
 <br />
I was reading Silandra's text and there's a difference in how she presents the reforming of the shards and the reviving of the spirit. <br />
 <br />
For the shards: I suppose all you really need is a good source of reliable cold to help the pieces mend together and a cool place to put them while that happens. Conclusion: Shards in box, combine blahblah.<br />
 <br />
For the spirit: The frozen spirit and the heat will need a warm place to sit for a while. The wording here makes me think it may be site specific, and we'll get some sort of message when the time/loc is right. <br />
 <br />
I might be reaching and expecting too much in the way of a clue in the text, considering how useless our npc's have been for the most part. Hell, half our npc info thus far has been hand gestures from Reyfin and the Qinimi folk.<br />

<br />
it wouldn't surprise me if it took the globe as a 3rd item given the lack of direction given so far in 1.5 and 2.0.  The main problem I see as making that not quite as feasible is it'd make the quest incredibly short and easy once it's found out.   Normally the globe has been used as a last(ish) step no?<br />
<br />
According to reyfin we're still supposed to fuse with the spirit appearently, maybe the 3rd item is supposed to be something that channels the thawed spirit into us or some sort of tool to make the spirit do something and we're looking for the equivalent of 1.5 soulbinders step lol.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should be looking for lore on Rain spirit yuisaha in oow or possiblely in god (anyone check uqua or inkuta?) and some npc will lead us to a step revolving around what to do with rain spirit once he's revived.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Some thoughts: I perused other quests, looking at the clues/info they received on the use of the anguish globe and completion of their epic 2.0. I highlighted words/phrases that tell the quester a: you're nearly done, and b: info about anguish or the globe of discordant energy. I didn't find a clear walkthrough of monk/sk epic, so no text from those. Kind of interesting!<br />
 <br />
Warrior:<br />
 Korbuk Brimblade says 'You were able to purify da presence, good. Just as I thought, da essence is pure and unadultered. Things are becoming ever clearer da closer we come to unraveling this mystery. Even without touching da essence, I can see pure rage surrounding a sword. I cannot even begin to express what it looks like. It's a very powerful image, to be sure. We're not quite done yet, however. There's a bit [more] dat needs to be done.<br />
 <br />
Korbuk Brimblade says 'I have sensed a strong and powerful draw from da fallen palace to da north. I've heard whispers dat it is called Anguish and is a terrible place to go. I don't know any more than dat, except dat there is... something there. My visions about this are chaotic and I don't know what to make of them. Be careful, there's no telling what may lie in wait for you there.'Cleric: (told in their first step what items they must return to the npc to complete the quest)<br />
Natvil examines your craftsmanship. 'Impressive, but I'm afraid that the temper was not sufficient to unlock the full potential of the shield. For now you may use it in its current state. I suspect to fully realize the latent potential of the shield you will require a soulstone from the person who it was bound to originally as well as a Globe of Discordant Energy. Return to me when you have that, I will assist you in completing its enhancement.' Enchanter:Priestess Rakhu murmurs in a strange tongue as she scans the incantation. She draws an intricate design along different portions of the staff, using the strange secretion, from which rises a pale green smoke. At last she stops and opens her eyes. &quot;Perfect. This tool has been consecrated and protected in the best way I know. There is but one thing left to do, for the staff is ready but not yet tested. Take this channeling crystal and venture into the land riddled with discord. When you encounter great evil there, you will recognize the energy of discord. Channel this energy into your staff, and it will become something more powerful than this world has seen. I wish you luck.&quot; Wizard: (first hails in 2.0 give this info) <br />
Talwyn Flamecaller says 'The power of the wizard courses through your veins thoroughly, ever in search of the opportunity to harness even more power. You have created a staff of immense power, yet even in its glory, is limited. To unleash the full potential of this weapon will be a large undertaking of its own. You must obtain a globe of pure discordant energy and return it to me. Look for assistance from the Plane of Discord from Grathnok Gilforgan. I know not where this being may be, but I do know that once you find him, he will be willing to assist you in finding the globe you seek .<br />
(Grathnok asks them to retrieve a stolen artifact.)<br />
 <br />
Upon turning in the horn:<br />
Grathnok Gilforgan says 'Your resolve and strength of will astounds me. You have returned to my people, the most sacred artifact we have on this world, and for that, you have earned my gratitude. As promised, I will give you the information that I have on the discordant globes. These globes can only be collected in one area, where the magic of discord constantly fluxes and an eerie sense of pain and anguish resides. Beware, it is an extremely dangerous area, protected by many of the Muramite Army's best and highest ranking members. Good luck to you, I hope you achieve all that you aspire.'<br />
Bard: (They receive a black orb at some point in 1.5 which isn't used but is referred to here.)<br />
First hail in 2.0:Alkron Wyrmsong says 'The orb that sits in your very pack holds the soul of Oshiruk you fool! The orb is the source of all his power. But he requires a body in order to resurrect himself into this existence. He certainly wants to reform his former self and to that end will try to find the breastplate, gauntlets and boots of his previous armor. There may be a way to destroy his former body at least. The power of Mata`Muram is vast, perhaps we can use these two evils to destroy each other. Bring me the armor and a globe of discordant energy from the lair of Mata`Muram and I will attempt to destroy the armor and prevent Oshiruk's return.' <br />
Compare these clues to Druid:<br />
Silanda Leafdew:<br />
Once you have the pieces together you'll need a source constant heat to revive the spirit. The frozen spirit and the heat will need a warm place to sit for a while. Source of constant heat -might- have led us to consider the anguish globe, except we found the everburning limb (ever...burning..). Silanda says 'the frozen sprit and the heat' and doesn't indicate a 3rd element. Our assumption we needed a 3rd item was based only on the fact that the combine of what she told us we needed didn't work, and that there were three slots in the box. There was no reference to Anguish, or a discordant globe of energy anywhere. You could conjecture (which kaidman did) that the everburning needed an energy source, but it was not suggested by the npc (and heck, its an ever...burning...limb). <br />
 <br />
It's nice to see this finished, but my feeling is for the most part this quest utilized random luck and sheer guesswork, vs conclusions based on clues and lore. <br />
 <br />
I also feel that our quest is very unbalanced, in itself and in relation to other class epics. The events in our quest were relatively easy. Of the four 'fights' involved, two most can solo/duo, and the last two can be done by 2-3 groups in most cases. Then, blammo, you need an Anguish drop. The gap between the bulk of the quest and the last drop is huge.<br />
 <br />
I believe the quest should have a more balanced progression in difficulty. The way it stands now, we will have hoards of druids from all levels of raiding guilds all stuck on Anguish (frustrating). If the earlier stages of the quest progressed up to more difficult encounters in a more gradual manner (along with the chest rewards), this quest would make more sense for growing/progressing guilds who aren't yet in Anguish. <br />
 <br />
That said, reading other boards and comparing quest info has reaffirmed my respect for our druid community attitude. Brain-storming and info sharing on this board showed a willingness to work together and help each other. Add to that a well organized assimilation of info in the walkthrough. Well done, folks.<br />

Congratulations to Kaidman for completing the quest, but, in my humble opinion, this weapon is not worth the time or effort involved in getting it compared to what can / does drop in both GoD and OoW raid zones.  Scrap the &quot;OMG Your nukes are better!&quot; BS and give it a useful effect, then it would be a lot more worthwhile.<br />

<br />
Euthanasia? I am Living Impaired?  ROFLMAO!!  I have beeen involved with this game since before Beta, nearly 7 years.  I have watched the design of the game unfold and when the first expansion was being discussed and &quot;Epics&quot; were first brought to the forefront, it became very exciting to witness their evolution.  Jump forward 5 years and Epic 2.0 begins to be whispered about in the dark corners and dimly lit corridors.  WoW...Epic 2.0...these will set the EQ community on their ears.  Even before OOW release, Gamer magazines, Computer-oriented television programs (TechTV, G4, etc) begin hyping the &quot;awesomeness&quot; of these mysterious weapons/items.  Even SoE hypes them on their Everquest II Webpage.  We are told that the 1.5 would be soloable (yeah....right); and later, that is changed to one groupable at most.  And that even changed.  Then, comes release of OOW.  <br />
<br />
Bottleneck after bottleneck in trying to progress thru the 1.5 version.   And while most other classses are given outright clues to theirs, Druids are given absolutely nothing.  Finally, 1.5!!!  WOOT!!!....Woot?....woot?....????? OMG!!  It is broken...it dont work....it is fubared.<br />
<br />
Then the &quot;quest&quot; (sheesh...you call this a quest?) begins for 2.0. People with the 1.5 start running around like chickens with their heads cut off hailing every NPC they come across in the hope that a response is given.  Finally, we get one of the most cryptic responses ever given in this game (with the exception of the newbie's first experience with that soon to be oft heard phrase, &quot;Loading....please wait!).  And while just about every other class, once again, is given clues, we, on the other hand, are given....nothing.<br />
<br />
Backstepping a second, shortly after a barrage of posts by those realizing the 1.5 is broken, we are told by SoE, that all Epics are being reviewed, and if they find something wrong, they will fix it.  In the mean time:<br />
<br />
Flash back forward to our quest:  After numerous false leads, misinterpretations, etc and with enormous help from our illustrious community, EPIC 2.0 is SOLVED.  Now looking at it from a distance, on the face of it, it looks nice...over 300 hp/mana (as all Epic 2.0s now show)....the stats...well, definitely not Epic.  and now to the Effect/focus...We see that most, if not ALL, caster Epics have the Spell/Bash Hate resist...a whopping 6%...nothing Epic or Class defining here.  And the effect.  Identical to 1.5 with slight modification...now it is recastable in 5 minutes, and allows 15 DD casts and 1 minute duration instead of the 10 min recast and 10 DD casts and 1 minute duration.  And the effect still doesn't even work (Purportedly to be fixed in the next patch), and even if it did work, many people have calculated the amount of increased damage IF all 15 DD casts landed within the 1 minute duration (with a -50 MR resist, not bloody likely) and the difference is marginal at best at 5%.<br />
<br />
So I will not, for the time being, return to this so-called EPIC quest.  I will say, however, that I congratulate each and everyone of you who have completed your 1.5 and also to Kaidman and those others soon to complete  Epic 2.0.  I am glad I was able to contribute the small part I did toward its solution.<br />

  Gamli hit a snow cougar for 1983 points of non-melee damage.<br />
  Without dmg focus item, adds 2.9% damage in this example (from 1926 base damage), WAY TO GO of making the clicky useful<br />
  I assume these 5% stacks with other focus effects like  Gelidran Rage (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=6456), hard to tell really with such small marginals.<br />
 So with Ancient Glacier Frost, a 35% ice nuke focus (or 40% when one of those shows up in oow) + 5% + tons of crit nuke aa's, a ranger still probably would nuke for more hehe</div></div><hr />

Basically you're probably lucky if this effect causes an extra 1k damage total.<br />
<br />
For an item that requires a decent raid presence even to aquire the 1.5, the stats are second rate.  And they wonder why the druids are abandoning this quest in droves? :P</div></div><hr />

During the section for epic 2.0 when your rdy to make your container (Now make a Clump of Refined Ancient Taelosian Clay (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=58031) by handing a Chunk of Broken Ancient Stone Worker (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=58026) to Malkidiv U`Yciunuz in Abysmal Sea). I do believe the NPC is not Malkidiv. When I went to do It He would not accept. Instead the person standing on his left (if your standing against back wall and sorry i forgot to write the name down) I was able to turn in and get back the Clump of Refined Ancient Taelosian Clay.<br />

I will try to edit with the Name of the NPC i did turn in to as soon as i can.</div></div><hr />

I wasted an hour doing it since I didn't know about the turn-in.  It's the same for taelosian tea leaves, you can't combine them to make tea unless you've done the abysmal sea brewing quest.  Those quests can be found at eqtraders and are very easy, just time consuming to do combines/hand-ins.</div></div><hr />

This wasn't expected, we backed up and waited a few min, and they despawned. Very unfun looking bunch. - this happen to anyone else?<br />
 <br />
I also obtained epic 2.0 Saturday, first on Tribunal (and 2.0 for that matter, we're the only guild in Anguish atm) But I was curious about the grafic effect. I see it pulsates, and glows, and has the little baubles of light that trail down the staff, the ghost effect is nice touch. However in the Character select screen (while your char is rotating or whatnot) the ends of the staff glowed a bright white, then flashed (exactly like a camera) then faded. I haven't been able to recreate this effect in game though. Anyone with the epic know what's up? It's very nice eye candy.<br />

Load up Minor Healing and chain heal yourself in game over and over.  Eventually it will go off and have a bright flash at each end of epic.  I didn't really notice it since I play in first person, now we have 3 druids with 2.0 so see it quite a bit.  Warrior 2.0 seems to spark off the ground occassionally, guessing that's their eyecandy.  Haven't seen any others do anything yet, but don't pay too close attention to it.</div></div><hr />

The Lightning Lord does not spawn until both of his trigger mobs are dead.  He didn't hit for over 1k, no ramps, flurries or AE's.  At 60% he spawns 3 adds on the walkway that path into the room, the adds hit for 1100, again no flurry or ramp.  Everything partial slows, chanter was fine, nothing mezzes.  As you get the Lightning Lord down to 15-20% he CH's himself fully.  Each time he does so one of the adds despawns.  The Lightning Lord himself only has ~100khp.  So basically just burn the hell out of him repeatedly, around 360khp total to do and the adds will all poof.</div></div><hr />

They have changed the requirements to get an Anguish expedition.  This is no longer (realistically) possible.  <br />
 <br />
One thing to remember though is that the raid doesn't have to be in WoS to get a Anguish exp., the raid just has to meet the req.`s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding the CoA combine, would someone please explain the expedition requirement?  I assume this means I cannot just zone into CoA and do the combine.  How many people must be included in the expedition?<br />
