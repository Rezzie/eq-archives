<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deathspookie</div><div class="date">08-26-2008, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have a question for those who have either read about or have actual hands on experience and can explain why our T6 4 pc set bonus is an increased HT amount? Are we going to be using HT in SWP?<br />
<br />
Also, why do I need a haste set, and when would it be useful to actually swap to my haste set? Im guessing that's SWP as well? Because I havent needed a haste set or a HT bonus since I've been in MH/BT, and we are almost done with BT, just Illidan left. Do i need to get a haste set ready?<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is because I picked up some haste gloves from BT a while back, and a couple of haste patterns for resto droods, so Im just wondering when we will actually need to have a haste set.</div></div><hr />

That's no mis-spelling!  All duriod is knows how 2 spell droid :&gt;<br />
<br />
(yes it is intentional - it derives from Alamo (http://sanctorum.negative0.net/druid.htm))<br />

Haste rating becomes increasingly important in very end game raiding because you already have unlimited mana and so much +healing that stacking more is increasingly not very efficient.  It becomes better to be able to get more heals off, within a given space of time.<br />
<br />
Haste rating also reduces your Global Cooldown (GCD) from 1.5 sec down to a theoretical 1.0 sec.  This has all sorts of benefits when it comes to our instant-cast hots, for example it means that with enough haste rating it becomes possible, and even easy, to keep lifebloom up on 4 tanks instead of just 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the healing touch bonus.  I am not sure what that is about.  My guess is that there will be some Sunwell fights where the healers really do just need to spam their biggest heals, and screw the overhealing, because the hits are so large that 2 consecutive hits would kill any tank, and healing over times become less useful in such situations.<br />
That is a guess though; I personally have yet to set foot in SWP.<br />

I see, thanks for the info. =D<br />
<br />
I too have yet to set foot in Sunwell.. well, that's a lie, I have been in there, but only to attempt the trash. I was so not impressed tbh. It looks like such a boring place. There are much more exciting things to look forward to within the next 2 months or so anyway. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are still working on a full ZA clear.  Hex Lord....are you kidding me?  <br />
<br />
LOL - it's probably a good thing I haven't made it so Sunwell yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">09-22-2008, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah our guild has plans once we get to 80 to going back and seeing Sunwell.  It will still be insanely hard, but hey it will be nice to see the bosses and see the instance in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, the consensus from T6 druids seems to be that the set bonuses on T6 (and, really, T5 for that matter) blow hard, and the only reason you even achieve set bonuses is because T6 is best-in-slot for most slots until you start replacing it with SWP gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">09-25-2008, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main problem is that the two-piece T4 set bonus is so valuable for cat druids, it's really very difficult to justify replacing it.  I use the T4 hat and chest, and I don't see myself replacing them with T6..  At least, not for dps gear..<br />
<br />
And the T5 bonus is awesome!  Insta-regrowth, how can anyone not like that? :&gt;  When I got it, the first thing I did was go straight out and soloed a felreaver.  And there was much rejoicing ^_^<br />

There is a blue post on it about a month ago.<br />
