<br />
<br />
I mean I have seen probally 70posts about it around the net on the various fourms I belong to.. but never once has anyone actually told or described what KEI does.<br />
<br />
So please, if you know inform a newb.<br />
<br />
Thx, Dimwitty :)</div></div><hr />

KEI is the acronym for Koadic's Endless Intellect.<br />
<br />
It's a group spell, costing 900 mana to cost; level 60 enchanter.<br />
<br />
It has the following effects: <br />
Increase Mana Pool by 250 <br />
Increase Mana by 14 per tick <br />
Increase INT by 25 <br />
Increase WIS by 25 <br />
<br />
Unless the enchanter has AAs to make it last longer, it lasts 2 and 1/2 hours.<br />
<br />
It doesn't stack with other Enchanter mana regen spells.  It does NOT stack with Necro Lich spells, so far as I know, but other than that, stacks with other mana regen spells different classes have.<br />
<br />
It's really noticable mana regen, and a pleasure to hunt with.  Hope the info helps.</div></div><hr />

On another thread you complained that nobody had responded...and it had only been 5 minutes.  Now you reply after 22 minutes?<br />
<br />
Takes awhile for people go to get in here and read and post.  They might not even look at yours the first time or two in here.<br />
<br />
KEI gives you some extra points to wis and int, and gives you fast mana regen.  KEI is clarity III with insight thrown in on top.  It has a bit slower regen than clarity IV, but lasts much longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think in some ways it is the downfall of truly good soloers and players, because it is truly a crutch, and I see more and more druids who cant seem to do anything without a KEI. Personally the only time I ever get a KEI or Voice of Quellious the Upgrade to KEI is if I am in a Raid. Now let me say this, I dont say no to a KEI if offered to me, but I dont actively seek it out. <br />
<br />
Everything I kill I can kill with KEI or without it, I just tend to be able to kill faster with a KEI. My skills and abilities are typically learned without a KEI, so that when I am unable to get a KEI it does not measureably effect my ability to do my job.<br />
<br />
Protection of the Nine (or Protection of the Cabbage) plus mask of the Hunter/Stalker is all I use on a day to day basis, and I dont have Mana Preservation focus Items (I do have Affliction Efficiency III, VERY useful with dots)<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me say this to young druids, if you cant kill it without a KEI, are you going to live if it drops in the middle of your fight? Learn your skills without a KEI and you will rarely be caught in a situation that you cannot get out of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, I like it to speed things up.  Why make 10 kills in an hour if you can make 20?  I spent hell levels, penalty levels, quads, charms, rotting, kiting, etc without it.  I've earned my relief wink wink.<br />
<br />
I also spent too much time looking at that damn book.</div></div><hr />

Instead of going AFK to med to full taking 15 mins, it takes 5. (Inexact math, just used as an example.) So you can resume killing (or imbueing!) that much faster. In some instances, it helps people kill more difficult mobs because of the edge they get from mana regen while still fighting. But for the most part, its about reducing the downtime.<br />
<br />
If you are operating at less than your wisdom cap, there's the added benefit it gives there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gamilenka</div><div class="date">04-23-2003, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It sucks being solo without the benefit of PoC/Nine/Glades and the Mask line.  If there are other people around, you are cut out if you don't have mana regen now.  Nobody wants to group with you under 58, and you get jipped on pulls soloing because everyone else DOES have KEI.  You make one kill, and by the time you have enough mana to pull again, everything is dead already.  I keep running in to people that will swear if they can not get KEI, they will not play their priest/caster characters.<br />
<br />
You should most certainly learn to play without it though.  It gives you a bigger mana pool, and the regen is a huge difference.  KEI will leave you eventually, and in a bad place.  If you don't know how to play without mana regen, you're done.  I use KEI quite often myself, but I know how to play wihtout it as well.<br />
<br />
The reason to learn how to play without it, other than there will be times when you don't have it...You learn how powerful you really are.  You have to focus more on what kills things faster, and what kills things and leaves you with more mana...and where each way is better to use.  You also learn how tough your character is.  If you don't have KEI on, using mana to heal yourself because you got hit too many times gets costly and really slows you down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Downtime was a hack to get you to group.<br />
Getting you to groups was to form relationships in game.<br />
Relationships in game were designed to make you play longer<br />
Playing longer was designed to make THEM money.<br />
<br />
People decry how fast it is to get to such and such, in such and such.  That is just sour grapes, at this point in the game.<br />
<br />
If you were going to quit because this EQ is not a social game, you have already quit.<br />
<br />
Those of us left, don't need such hacks anymore to play.  Downtime is evil.  Sure it is easier these days for new chars, no doubt.  But in your heart, you knew back then, it should have been this way the whole time.<br />
<br />
Do you really want your kids to walk both way uphill in the snow with no shoes, just because you did?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things were much tougher back then, and you appreciated things a lot more ....thats for sure.<br />
<br />
But i survived ...along with tons of other people<br />
<br />
That being said, c3 and the other mana buffs are still great things.<br />
<br />
Lot easier nowadays for me now with 5k + mana and FT 15 and mana preservation and spell strenthening focuses, and to be frank, more fun too.  But let us not forget the mobs have gotten stronger right along with the player characters who have been gettin buffed up.<br />
<br />
Sure i could make it without my toys ...hell ive done it before;  but why would i want to?<br />
<br />
Downtime doesnt = fun IMHO</div></div><hr />

I was back there back then, and I, &gt;I&lt;, did not appreciate it.<br />

Speak for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, sorry, thought it was a different type of thread :) <br />
<br />
KEI is definitely a boon to soloers.  However, Verant should have limited it (and all such spells) to not landing on people below certain levels - whether targeted or not.<br />
<br />
Giving a level 10 KEI and Aego, along with a godly weapon allows them to get through too many levels too quickly without learning how to play their class.  Now, if this is an old time player with lots of alts who knows each class, that's one thing.  But new players who hit level 35-40 without knowing how to mez for example, are not good :)</div></div><hr />
