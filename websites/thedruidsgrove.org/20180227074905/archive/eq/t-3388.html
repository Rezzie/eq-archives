<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exedor</div><div class="date">01-25-2002, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me preface this by saying: Yes the ac has been nerfed. Yes we are all disappointed. But adding a HEFTY dose of resists and a nice bit of wisdom to compensate us makes me feel a LOT better about it :)<br />
<br />
What you will need: Main thing you're gonna need is levels, if you are 55 + you'll only need 1 -2 friends to make this doable. Though it can be VERY painstaking work doing it that way and the more peopel you have the faster the kills and drops go.<br />
<br />
Lower than that 55, I strongly suggest a full group. And to prevent frustration, chanters and clerics are an excellent choice, though neither is required. <br />
<br />
How to get there: The route is fairly simple. From nexus to Netherbian lair, Straight thru to the opposite end and zone out to dawnshroud. Invis up and follow the left wall past the rockhopper caves to the maidens eye zone line. Keep invis up and zone to maidens. From maidens zone basically run straight accross the fields to the opposite wall of the zone, of to the right a little ways you'll see a structure guarded Xi Vius and Xin Thall Centians, inside is the zone to umbral planes. Bind here before you zone in. <br />
<br />
Welcome to umbral plains, the zone seems designed to allow small guilds and groups of friends to get themselves gear that is comparable to the stuff the semi-ubers wear. /thank verant (sincerely) The first obstacle you will encounter is the static spawn dark assasin who camps just around the corner from the zone line. <br />
<br />
Dark assasins are the HARASSMENT mobs of umbral and if you run into problems while here, it will probably be due to these guys. They have huge aggro range so basically if you can see them, they can see you. they also cast necro snare which slows you to a crawl, and they are immune to basically all control spells (root, snare, mez, charm, etc). Thankfully, most of them dont see invis, but randomly they spawn ones that do see invis. Some will not see invis to undead, so if you need to get past him and invis isnt working, try invis to undead. If neither works on that particular pop, you will need to kill him to continue without deaths. If you have rogues rangers or bards with you, you may want to kill him anyway because assasins are the mobs that drop rogue / bard / ranger gear in this zone.<br />
<br />
Once you have dealt with the assasin, make sure everyone is invised and follow the right wall past the temple which is surrounded by massive stone guardians, we think this is the zone to vex thall. Anyway, pass the temple and stick to teh right wall til you get to about neg 1700 neg 1700. This is as close to a safe pull spot as you're gonna find near the target mobs spawn.<br />
<br />
When ready to start pulling, face directly out from the wall and a little to the right, run up over the hill and you will see two sets of ruins with big flat floors and a few standing timbers. Your target is gonna be the DISTURBED ELYSIAN REMAINS, the spawn in packs of three and are laying down on the flat floor like piles of bones. With harmony I was able to pull singles most of the time. They are snare/root/dot soloable but Verant has given them such uber hit points that this is not advisable. All mobs in this zone also hit for pretty serious damage so be warned, you wont be tanking these for long as a druid hehe. <br />
<br />
Pathing here kinda sucks so you will need to stay close enough to them during the pull or they will go tearing off in some bizzarre direction and return to your camp 10 mins later with lots of trainage. <br />
<br />
At this point you are basically home-free, just keep clearing the disturbed remains and eventually you will start seeing your nifty druid armor drop. <br />
<br />
Things to watch out for: Dark Assasin's DO path near the ruins, if you are doing this without a cleric or feign death puller, then you need to keep a healer within range of the puller in case he gets snared by an assasin during the pull. If he does get snared, your heal should transfer aggro to you, at which point you can pull him back towards the group and decide whether you have the manpower to kill him or if you need to have everyone camp to clear agrro and you gate to maidens and run back, succoring to the zone line is also a viable option, but the succor point is within aggro range of the assasin who guards the zone line. So be prepared to zone really fast to maidens after succoring.<br />
<br />
Other items of note: Most of the mobs here don't summon. But have uber hitpoints and hit hard to make up for it. Fallen Soldiers DO summon and you will berunning into them, but they otherwise aren't *much* tougher than the disturbeds. <br />
<br />
If you have Int casters with you, you WANT lots of fallen soldiers and Shak Dathors, as they are the ones who drop the Int caster Armor (dreamweaver's robe is like 12 ac 14 int 40 hp 40 mana and more, or something liek that /drool) If you have platemail classes, you will want to pull the goranga looking things that you passed on the way here. They drop the platemail, but my experience with fighting them is ratehr limited so you'll have to figure out how to do them on your own. in fact, please post whatever you find about them here :)<br />
<br />
Not a whole lot more to be said about it beyond this. But if you die and need a resser, try dragging your corpse to maiden's eye zone line and looking in maidens for a cleric to pop over and click you. Be prepared to go invis the cleric and guide him to the zone in. Offering free portage / donations for his help is also a nice thing to do :)<br />
<br />
Edit: PS - When Fighting Assasin's Try to let the tanks build aggro for a few secs before anyone casts slows or heals or debuffs, a chanter trying to slow one before aggro is built up on teh tank will die fast, a shaman can prolly endure long enough to have a good tank taunt it off, but why risk it. <br />
<br />
PPS - If you like this guide and find it helpful, you can thank me by posting any further info you you discover about this zone, especially what mobs drop what kind of armor, as so far all I know is Disturbed = Druid, Shak's and Fallen = Int caster, Assasins = Chain Class and Bard, and The Goranga looking dudes = Platemail. We have yet to figure out which ones to target for the monk, shaman and beastlord gear. And my info on the platemail gear is sketchy at best :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Just Allyssia</div><div class="date">01-25-2002, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very helpful indeed.  Although it is possible to solo these w/root/snare/dots.  It's a long painstaking process, but for the willing it is possible.  The tactics are a lil different.  I'll have to check /loc next time I'm at my location.  I do think it's closer to go right from the ME zone in, however by habit I always head left, and go all the way down the left wall staying high up on the wall past the netherbian caves and past the valley area just past the rock sticking high up out of the wall. You'll run along the wall and notice it starting to turn left again at that point there's a tree to your right with a wooden platform almost like a partial tree house. This is your camp spot.  <br />
<br />
Disturbed Elysian Remains pace back and forth here, as do Shaks and an occasional Fallen Soldier.  When you spot an Elysian alone pull him high up on the wall and root him.  Snare him an dot him up and med, repeat and rinse.  As long as you fight up on the wall you will not aggro the DA's or other mobs that path back and forth.  If you have the Mana you can kill two at a time.  Just keep Egress up in case you run into trouble.  <br />
<br />
Soloing here isn't the fastest experience, but if others don't wanna deal with the slow drops and you want your umbral equipment, this is an alternative. <br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azitar</div><div class="date">01-25-2002, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Snagged this right of our guilds druid forumn.  I wrote this a few days ago.<br />
<br />
YES, these guys are soloable by ONLY druids (druids &gt; all).<br />
<br />
Zone into Umbral. Invis up. Follow RIGHT zone wall. About 40 seconds of running and you will come across a stone building with &quot;Massive Stone Guardians&quot;. Go around or over the building and continue along zone wall. About 10-15 seconds later, you will reach the 'corner' of the zone. (It may not be 100% obvious that its a corner) You will be able to see the stone guardian building from this spot. This is the pull to spot.<br />
If your in the 'corner' spot, facing out toward the zone, where the stone guardians are to you left, there is two hills directly ahead with a small passage through the middle. (Its not a trail.  Its between where the two hills meet.  Its not as elevated as the top of the hills)<br />
<br />
To pull Elysians, BE INVISED and run through the passage in the middle of the hill. You will see a farm house. There appear to be dead skeletons laying on the ground in the farm house. They are not dead, they are the Elysians. Elysians see invis and will be scowling while invised. Inch slowly toward them until the closest one stands up and starts chasing you. I would wait about 7 seconds before inching closer, they tend to take a few seconds to agro and you don't want to pull more than 1 preferably. The Key to this is staying invised. There are wonderers near the farm house, and these mobs have long agro ranges, plus the Dark Assassins that are line of sight agro (they can be agroed from a long ways away, well out of sight). These unwanted mobs dont see invis. <br />
<br />
Once you get an Elysian agroed, pull back to 'corner' behind hill. Fight the mob here and kit in Circles or in a line. You don't want stay as close to the corner as you can be while fighting these guys. Elysians have a LOT of HP's but are fairly easy kills. Spells stick to them fairly well. Sometimes i accidently pull 2 and it's a long fight.<br />
Drops seem to be rare. I would predict about PoF rare.</div></div><hr />

could you elaborate on the soloing a little more?  around how many hp do they have? What lvl would you recomend soloing... How about what your spells are you using? just root/doting?   <br />
dont wanna get a bunch of loot happy little guys running to this deadly place and comming in for an unpleasant suprise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azitar</div><div class="date">01-25-2002, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never calculated HPs, but i would guess 15k -20k perhaps.<br />
If i pull 2, i usually use root / Winged Death / Epic / Drones of Doom (arms) on one Elysian and use root / Epic / Drones on other.<br />
If i pull 1, I use about the same tactics.  Sometimes throw Ro's on him, but usually not.<br />
With 1 pull, its about 7-12 min fight maybe.  Unfortunately, i really haven't really done much testing as to mobs hp's, how long it takes to kill them, etc..<br />
Spells stick fairly well to these guys.  Some resists, but not too many.<br />
Soloable at 55+ i would imagine.  Epic would come in handy.<br />
Its hard to describe via the internet, but if you find the right spot, its a pretty safe camp. <br />
These guys are really not tough at all, it's mainly a long fight.<br />
If you take a group to this spot, make sure they stay in the coner, or at least behind the hills.  I have never had an add while fighting Elysians behind the hills.  I do know however, if you dare go up on the hill or over the hill un-invised, expect a Dark Assassin =)</div></div><hr />

i have way less patience than you :) i consider that if a fight takes 7-12 minutes, the mob is unsoloable... i just dont have the time for that.<br />
<br />
i guess in this case patience is rewarded... but man... 4 kills an hour? i just cant take that kinda pace.<br />

thanks for the info, i had planned on tryin to solo these LOL</div></div><hr />

hey exedor,<br />
<br />
I spent a week alone in the umbral plains...<br />
<br />
I solo'd meself boots,legs,arms,tunic,and two bracers... xp sucked and it took forever... but i did get about 4k worth of gems, a dozen spells, and 30 or so skulls.  I got the tunic the very first kill after the nerf patch.  I was severely disappointed with the nerf, but some of the stuff, the legs especially are still very nice.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who goes there solo should sneak up to Binkl Dirkwafer and talk to him.  He basically calls you crazy... but after the first few days, you start turning into Binkl Dirkwafer.<br />

<br />
I know for a fact that an enchanter could solo kill these (but why would they heh).<br />
<br />
As to hp, I run through 7-8 WD, 7-8 drones, 2-3 epics along with a root or two (or three) to kill one, so that's about how many hp they have.<br />
<br />
No, the xp isn't fast, but on the other hand it's not like it takes a lot of attention to do.  I watch TV, talk/chat with friends, read a book etc while I kill them, it takes so little attention.<br />

I egressed as per someone's suggestion and though I was the only person in the zone a Dark assasin ran right up to me after I egressed from a ways off, pretty much instantly, and proceeded to beat me to death before I could zone. <br />
<br />
I had to eat that rez. After that, I instead bound just inside maidens in a corner and gated if I did not get an elysian all by itself.<br />
<br />
I really don't think an enchanter would solo that well there. Chanter can't ensnare things before root and if their charm broke on one they'd have two things on them and these things have MANY hp and hit hard. Yeah Pretty much what random said as far as DOTS, thank gad for that epic ;) A bonus is that when I did try it I was also the only person in the zone, so little chance of someone training me.<br />
<br />
As far as patience, with the epic and drones bracer (or es vambs) its really not that bad because on root/dot fight like that I'm nearly full mana by the time the thing dies so I have no medding up downtime. These have so many hp you can really gauge it easily and stop doing winged then.</div></div><hr />

Killed 2 corrupted and got legs once.  All of the other drops were off the common mob.  Got legs again off regular mob (rotted), gloves, wrist and boots in about 4 hours of single group action.  For those that care - 52 Warrior, 54 Rogue, 56 Chanter, 56 Cleric, 58 Shaman, 60 Druid.  <br />
<br />
I solo'd one mob while I waited for the others to arrive all I can say is OMG!  Make some friends and bring them with you.  It will go sooooooo much faster.<br />

With bedlam, stun, mez, and charm, keeping those relatively low mr mobs under control is not a problem.  Pulling them up to the wall means that runners aren't a big deal either.  Even if root fails on a runner, it can't get far enough to get an add.  And then after he kills one, he breaks his charm and kills the other one with 1 or 2 nukes.<br />
<br />
He can even solo fallen soldiers (which summon), which is something that, while I may be able to do, would be very annoying.<br />
<br />
Then he found out that dream weaver armor sucks and stopped going.<br />
<br />
Of course he's 60, which probably helps in terms of resists and charm durations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">01-26-2002, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The HP are approximately 15K.  The length of time for doing the kill solo (7 to 15 min.) is accurate, but doesn't include med time at the end (for all the Winged Deaths).  If you don't kill using WD, then the kill time is even longer.  It's a tradeoff using BoR...you can kill it faster, but you spend more time medding (it was a bit faster back when you could med on a horse while using an item).  <br />
<br />
Don't count on more than 3 to 4 kills per hour solo.   You aren't here for the XP...even in a group, the mobs' HPs are too high for efficient XPing.   You are here for the items, and the bit of XP you get is lagniappe.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't try this without an Epic.  Regardless of level.  I highly recommend doing it at 60, just so you have Mask and PoG up to increase your mana regen.<br />
<br />
The fastest route to the hunting area is to take a right from the zone in.  <br />
<br />
When you Egress, you are taken to the zone-in tunnel, but this is directly in LOS of the Dark Assassin that sits at the mouth of the tunnel.  As soon as you Egress, the DA will run for you, so turn right and make the run to the zone out, unless there is a group camping the area killing the DA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree on the not more than 3 or 4 kills per hour, really need a book or something while hunting those. I don't have Moth and use winged death so I need to stop for medding after 3 skellies. Killed 10 in little more than 2 hours, no armor drop, 2 spells.<br />
<br />
Be patient when you pull one usually waiting a few seconds will help single pulling more than any kind of other skill. The mobs often rest under the &quot;pile of bone form&quot; but usually one wakes up and roam a bit apart from the others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quelm</div><div class="date">01-26-2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One way to speed up the killing process is to do 2 or 3 at a time.  Almost all my damage comes from my Epic and Bracer.  By doubling up the mobs, you increase your damage output from ~900/minute to ~1800/minute.  56 root can last the full 3 minutes, I sometimes find myself recasting it just before the timer runs out.<br />
<br />
A good way to do them is with a friend or two.  Bards and Enchanters can charm-fight them.  Necros, Clerics and Shamans can help with DoTs.  If meleers come to help out, I'll toss them a regen, use Fixation on the skeleton, and let them step in for some hits, then step out to heal back up.  If you have 4 or more, melee+direct healing becomes an efficient option.<br />
<br />
Drop rates are pretty good now.  I'd say they're similar to drops in the Planes.  In fact, this place reminds me a lot of Plane of Fear.  It is just a little more soloable.<br />

<br />
Ya, and they cast Druid spells, but not the whole fight.  They seem to have a lot less hps than the Disturbed Elysian Remains.  A 47 Sk was in our group there last night and he was conning the Disturbed Elysian Remains blue with a few evens.<br />
<br />
As far as drops go from my experiences:<br />
Gloves, Boots, Legs, Bracers - common<br />
Arms, Tunic, Cap - Rare<br />
<br />
Oh, another thing - Harmony WILL NOT work on the Corrupted Elysian Remains.  You will get the message that your target seems to be unaffected no matter how many times you cast it.  In such cases you will pull both everytime.<br />
<br />
Your biggest challenges solo are avoiding add pulls (DAs, Currupted) and getting past the front door DA at the zone IF it spawns see vis.<br />

but i have a small problem. im lvl 58, with around 230 wis.  Some of you talk about only having to root 3 or 4 times, and can pull 3 skeles using Wing death before you have to med.  Please explain your tactic, because im using WD, engorging root, and esvamps.  and if root lasts for more than a min, i get all jumpy and happy.  root is resisted 4 out of 5 times, and it takes a good 20 min sometimes to kill just one (ensnare dropping twice in one fight really sucks.)<br />

   Do you have your Epic? that alone increases your damage output by 1600 every 3mins.  2ndly when did you start killing these?  If just yesterday, then be aware after wednesday's patch, these have been significantly increased in difficultly.  Many are conning even and yellow to a lvl 55, whereas before all were blue to a lvl 54 person.  Root and snare are being resisted much more frequently then before.  Congrats on your BP.<br />

I didnt start killing these things until after that patch.  Its a good thing they didnt make them summon, or i would have died heh.<br />
<br />
On the plus side.  It seems that using grasping roots (lvl 5 root) keeps them rooted longer than the lvl 54 one.  And it hits more often.<br />
<br />
On top of that, im saving a bit of mana.<br />
<br />
lvl 5 root = 35mana, 1 min root or so (10dd)<br />
<br />
lvl 54 root = 75mana, 3 min root (187dd, but is resisted ALOT and sticks for less than a min most of the time)<br />

<br />
hehe i meet Exedor today while i was killing Elyseans ;-) nice guy, thanxs for the infos you give to me :-)<br />
<br />
Since the last patch Elyseans are still soloable, but way more difficult, now they con 54 to 56 and they got near 25K hps.<br />
The ones that con 56 like to resist roots and snare a lot. <br />
<br />
Since the patch, i still can solo them as a 59 druid without epic. But fights can go to 45 minutes :-(<br />
Anyway, my tactic is 2 computer, adding a 55 druid to help and the kills are safe and take near 30 minutes with medding FM.<br />
<br />
In about 35 hours since the patch i got 2 full set but no tunics :(<br />
Wondering if i'm extremely unlucky, or if the tunic drop rate is nerfed, or even if just corrupted drop it now ?<br />

Three armor drops in 3 hours. BP, boots, and gloves. Tough kill even with Epic. I used Epic, WD, and ESarms, but spent most of my mana re-rooting/attempting to root those little buggers. It worked out that doing solo, with medding etc., I couldn't even break the spawn in the camp itself, so I waited for the inevitable roamer to leave camp and pulled him. There is always one out and I always got singles without adds.<br />
<br />
Root is most definetely resisted often, yet oddly (or so it seemed to me at the time), the ones that had armor drops resisted more often. Coincidence? maybe.<br />
<br />
The thing that gets me is that I got better armor from 3 hours of work than I had in the past year of multiple PoF raids and I didn't need a raiding party. WTG me =)<br />

<br />
I still wonder if this is what verant &quot;intended&quot;.  I think the drop rate on elysian armor is a bit high compared to other armor drops I've seen in that zone and all other EQ zones.  They aren't that hard to solo since pulling is pretty trivial as long as your careful.  And well, if it's rootable and doesn't summon, it's pretty much dead meat by druid standards.<br />
<br />
The balance factor leaves a funny taste in my mouth however.  I mean, Gorgons in Fear, even if I could somehow zone into PoF and live, pull one solo, then actually solo it, I'd get worse armor drops. :p</div></div><hr />

Elysian is probably going to be my full-time BP for the remainder of my EQ career. I'll still go after a Kael RotG BP, but will just swap it in long enough for casting. It is shockingly easy to acquire Elysian compared to the time and effort required in the planes and in ToV. Remains seem to drop armor every five or six kills at most, and during the time I spent in Umbral I gave away 3 duplicate sets of legs, 4 boots, gloves, arms, and several bracers.<br />
<br />
I don't habitually solo. I'm alter-specced and while I consider myself a smart player, I probably don't know all the little timesaving tricks that a career soloer might have up their sleeves. All I did was pull and lock down, epic, arm dot, cast winged death, med and repeat casts as needed until the remains fell over. Nothing special. I spent mana on the side keeping PotG, Bladecoat, Eagle or Howler, and an occasional Regrowth up as buffs.<br />
<br />
Pulling singles was dead easy--I didn't even bother with Harmony. Elysians and their neighboring mobs don't appear to assist each other and aggro ranges are a good bit lower than in the planes.<br />
<br />
The remains spawn across a spectrum of levels I would estimate at between 54 and 57. The low end remains were so easy that I found myself ending fights sometimes with 80 mana. Yes, this is against the post-upgraded remains. Againt the most resist prone remains a fight rarely took more than ten minutes, and I ended with at least 40 mana. Even the absolute worst case where I was a little sloppy was no contest. On the two occasions where I had Koadic's, there was no downtime to speak of. One Elysian would die and seconds later I would be pulling another.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to say I'm not happy about Elysian's availability, but the risk/reward is strikingly out of line with what I've come to think of as &quot;normal&quot;. I can't help but believe that some kind of further nerfing is imminent.</div></div><hr />

Where did you get this idea?  Unless it has changed recently, you turn in 4 skulls, you get faction, and you probably will need more faction.  Killing umbrous toilers will do the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've spent here countless hours, solo and teaming up with <br />
druids of all levels.<br />
<br />
This is the armor of choice for me as well... wish i had<br />
regrowth of the grove... and it would be the only thing<br />
i really want out of the quest armor.. :)<br />
<br />
You can use harmony on all except the corrupted... which you<br />
shouldnt pull anyway, unless if with others who can slow/heal blahblah.<br />
<br />
Pulling more than one solo is just stupid, and a waste of time, IMHO, so if you do get more than one, gate or egress out.<br />
Egress works for me, as i use SOE + mask of hunter.<br />
If you use wolf form, do bare in mind that you'll end up without it, and a few feet from the zone line... just common sense. (if you use egress)<br />
<br />
Before going to the ruins just over the hill i run around the hill and check for freebie roamers... usually some up and around.<br />
You can be invis the whole time, just get close to the remains, and as they run at ya, just run back :)<br />
I usually make it back to the kite area with my invis still on.<br />
<br />
Dark Assassins, named, skeletal drudge, and elysians see invis.<br />
There is only 1 DA that wanders close to that house (ruins), and it is the only one you should really worry about.<br />
The aggro seems to be close to the line-of-sight, although clearly isnt, as i often see them and they dont attack :)<br />
<br />
Pathing is broken around some trees, do watch where your mob is running... <br />
<br />
I had wondered if light-sources emminating from some of the remains have anything to do with the armor they drop.<br />
So far, I've seen a bunch... most of the time it is just gems <br />
that elysians drop, except for one time when only boots droped and elysian had lightsource on it (and nothing else).<br />
<br />
Epic definately helps, although I would still do this solo without it.. the drop NERF BAT is imminent.  I know it.<br />
So get the armor while you can ;)<br />
I definately think either the drop rate will be 'tweaked', or<br />
elysians will start to summon... lets face it, they are 54-57.<br />
Maybe they'll put some mobs that path into the kite area...<br />
Either way.  Get yours now ;)<br />
<br />
This whole camp takes a lot shorter when you team with others.  Doing this with 5 or 6 druids in a group is very fun.<br />
I just pull 2 or 3 at a time .... <br />
<br />
Some gems that drop from them are worth good 70pp+.<br />
The skulls I assume are for some faction, or quest.<br />
Spells range from 52-54 in levels. (soe, mark of retribution, <br />
shaman dot...forget name)<br />
<br />
The drop rates werent all that great for me... <br />
It took a good number of these things to for the drops...<br />
but patience prevails... and all the pain is worth it in the end.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

I did this for the first time this weekend.  I killed a few solo then got a double pull and found that faster.  Took me 15 minutes to kill one using Epic/WD/Drones, and ending up at 1/2 mana.  Started doing two at a time and leaving out WD, did a pair in 25 minutes or so.  Each one needs to be rooted approximately 30 times with resists (not kidding).<br />
<br />
Doing two at a time was a rush, and I will come back to do it again (I love it when killing mobs is like the lottery).<br />
<br />
In 9 kills mixed over two short sessions, I got one drop - a tunic.  Another druid that was soloing there said the drop rate has been hit with the nerf stick, but I have little to compare it to.  I do know that the 2.5 hours or so that I was there was a lot less time to get a tunic than I spent in HoT so far without seeing one even drop.</div></div><hr />

Roots and even snares resist far more often than the time of the original posting here. Use the original poster's &quot;guide&quot; as a means to find the camp spot, but the rest is pretty much outdated info that could be updated to match current sit-rep of the zone in general. The Dark Assassin mentioned at zone entry no longer exists there, so Egress is now MUCH safer than the past and should be used without hesitation in case of a bad pull. Experience will go painfully slow solo, but if you are here for experience then you are in for disappointment. Hunt these for the armor drops or not at all in my opinion. Pathing still leaves the corner pull spot safe from roamers and the Disturbed Elysians remain the ONLY mobs in Umbral that do not summon. Verant obviously intended making these guys soloable by us or they would have changed the summon situation many patches ago. What they did was make it VERY difficult to do this without a LOT of mana (ie-high level) and without an epic to use) Get an Elysian that resists 5 or 6 roots during the kill, together with 2 to 3 resists on Winged Death or BoR, and mana can drop too fast. Leave yourself that 100 mana cushion you need for egress and use it if you are in trouble. Good luck on the drops if you choose to kill these solo. HPs I would estimate in the 18-20 K range, but hard to be sure since they spend much of the kill time moving, which results in decreased effectiveness of the DoTs used. Would be nice to see one that held root max time all thru the kill to get a closer idea, but the closest estimate came from parsing a melee battle when grouped once. That is where we found the 18-20 k figure.</div></div><hr />

Armor looks like silver chain on Elfs.  It looks like a dull silver chain on Humans and Halflings.  The helm has a graphic on Humans and Halflings.

The drops have been especially horrible tonight.  On Day 1 I had 4 drops in 12 Elysians.  Tonight I had 1 drop in 21 Elysians.  <br />

How often did the tunic dropped for you guys?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quaras Shadowscythe</div><div class="date">04-02-2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Milesgond -- the best way to pull these is invisibly (as noted in the first ten or so posts -- tough to find now thought).  Only the Elysians and the Dark Assassins see through invis in the specific corner where you hunt them, so its a nice way to aggro only the Elysians and pull them past other mobs (who will ignore you as long as you are not hit) to your rooting spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KnightWard</div><div class="date">04-03-2002, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, My issues with these is pulling.  Once I get one single - its normally not to big a hassle to kill it.  About 12 min at level 58 with Epic.  No Potg Yet =/  It takes me about 60/80 percent mana for one kill.<br />
<br />
So, like the guide says, I invis, and see the farmhouse.  However I normally spend 20 min or so looking for a wanderer, becuase every time I edge close to the house I end up with 2 at minimum, 4 at max (the one time 3 and a Elder was really bad.. sigh).  I'd like to take the 20 min doing nothing but looking for a pull angle out my time there.<br />
<br />
Does Harmony *still* work on these?  A 60 Druid in my guild said it didn't really do much for him, but he's 2 levels above me so his aggro radius is bound to be lower.  <br />
<br />
If harmony does work, how do you find it easiest to target these in sitting positions?  I have to get *really* close to the house - even with clip plane on near half.  Any suggestions on which &quot;row&quot; etc to aim for to pull the ones along the house edges?<br />
<br />
Any help would be most appeariacted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rannios</div><div class="date">04-04-2002, 04:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Easiest is to find a wanderer.  Instead of going over the hills, try going north along the east wall.  There's one wanderer that paths along that area.  If you don't see one, then go north even further past the elysian houses.  You'll probably see a wanderer or two at this point.  Some wanderers also path right across the houses.  Pull them all the way up along the east zone wall and you won't aggro the stuff in between.  <br />
<br />
If there's no wanderers at all, which was rare for me, just go to the south end of the first house and harmony.  It's hard to target them, but just keep clicking a few times.  If you get a DA or corrupted elysian, run and gate.  For any other adds, I run them to east wall just north of the SE corner.  Here you'll see a couple of trees.  Running from north to south back to SE corner, go between the trees.  Somehow they don't follow you through (but will come back with friends to kick you in the butt 5 mins later).  So I just camp to clear aggro at this point.</div></div><hr />

Where has everyone who has already looted one had theirs drop?  I have spent almost a week there now averaging about 3 hours a day.  In that time I have seen boots, gloves, a helm and 2 legs drop.  I am not pulling them from their normal spawn point but rather am sitting up high on a wall and pulling the ones that wander by on the valley floor below me.  Has anyone who has had a tunic had theirs drop for them where I am at or have all the tunic drops been from mobs pulled directly from their spawn point?  :)<br />

When I was a lil druid, I had a really crappy PC and couldn't group because of excessive lag.  I could only fight a single mob while porcupining.  I fought in FM in the 30s (31-40) to work on melee stats, and killed LITERALLY hundreds of giants, as well as a few hundred more in recent times PLing other chars.  Have never seen a forest loop drop.  They only drop off of giants from the fort.<br />

I've targeted and conned some Netherbian Ravagers and some Shak Dathor (sp?) that can see through Camo. Not all of them can, in fact most cannot. But you need to con them to be sure.</div></div><hr />

Exact Faction hits for the turn-in I dont recall, but there were no negative ones included. Hailing him gets you a nice story to listen to regarding the Vex Thal quest.

by the way, if you take a left (go north) then go east along northen zone wall, then south along east zone wall..w/ imp sup camo you never have to worry about aggroing anything if you're running high on the walls, alot of times best way to pull elsyians w/ mobs nearby is to invis up and proxy aggro them but dont get hit and then run to zone wall , snare and root/dot on the wall high</div></div><hr />
