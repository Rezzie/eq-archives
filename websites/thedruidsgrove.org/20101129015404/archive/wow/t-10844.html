I just thought I would share the good news with y'all....I hit 60 this weekend!  I was mainly grinding the last bit so I could just enjoy my last time of being full feral (I want to raid/heal some and all).  Now it's time to start working on getting me some decent gear for healing and better PvP gear.  I'm so excited....tonight will be my first runs as a level 60 Druid!  <br />
<br />
Well I just wanted to share my excitement with you all.  If any of you are Horde on Shadow Moon....feel free to send me a tell anytime.  I will try my best to hook up any of my lovely Druid friends....if at all possible.</div></div><hr />

I think some of my friends are going to help me get a group together tonight to get a run or so in for some better gear.  I wanted to save as much money as I could since I was mainly soloing it.<br />
<br />
Maybe now that I have a 60 on this server I won't miss my retired 60 Priest as much.  I'm so excited!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-17-2006, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True. Raid healing can be lots of fun....part of the reason I rolled a Druid on Shadow Moon.  I wanted to do fun stealth runs with my boyfriend but also keep to my &quot;roots&quot; (LOL).  <br />
<br />
I used to hate the thought of healing only (originally was a shadow priest that eventually went disc/holy)....but after my first few runs....I loved it!  I think starting out I will go 30/21 for now....and then see where that takes me.  If I don't enjoy it so much then I might move on to one of the other builds I was considering for 60.  I'm the kinda person I like to test out builds until I find the perfect match for me.  That's how I got to understand my priest so well.</div></div><hr />

I'm just glad I'm finally there....I kinda forgot about my professions most the way there because I was wanting to get 60 so fast....so now I have to work on those....finally finished getting First Aid to 300 last night!  Now I gotta work on my Alc/Herb, Fishing, and if I want to Cooking.<br />
<br />
I didn't get to do the Attunement run last night....too many distractions in RL.  Pups will do that to you tho....LOL.</div></div><hr />
