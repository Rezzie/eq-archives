<br />
The patch 3.0.2 nerfed raids..HARD.<br />
<br />
My druid is in mostly blues with a few epics.  I MT'd a Kara PuG with ease. 2 hrs, full clear, no a single death! (not even when the priest had to tank Netherspite cause my OT was useless!)<br />
<br />
It was tough to get my druid into raids before because her gear is entry level.  Pre patch, she was a solid off tank, but never able to take the big hits like Prince.  Yesterday I full cleared and MT'd both Kara and ZA with less than 4 hrs of play!   That's a successful afternoon.  Sadly, no gear upgrades from either though...only 1 tanking upgrade dropped and my dice turned on me (lost with a 16 to 22...grr)  <br />
<br />
Good news is its pretty easy to rack up the badge gear when you pickup 30+ badges in an afternoon!!!  <br />
<br />
Enjoy the nerf before blizzard realizes what they did and &quot;fix&quot; it.</div></div><hr />

is the bear mount still available?</div></div><hr />

<br />
now that mounts don't take up bagspace, i see a few vanity mounts in my future</div></div><hr />

 <br />
They took the Amani War Bear mount out of ZA with 3.02 for this very reason :( <br />
 <br />
On the super easy instance note - I cleared AQ40 last night in 45 minutes ^^  (picked up one of those bug mounts too, got them on 2 toons now :))<br />
 <br />
A ret pally and lock that I know just 2 manned Onyxia.  <br />
 <br />
Cleared heroic Sethekk (going for the Anzu mount) in ~35 minutes.<br />
 <br />
I don't think that Blizz is going to &quot;fix&quot; anything.  They are basically throwing us a bone, allowing us to have some fun and just blaze through everything, considering most of the gear we are getting will be obsolete sometime in December for most of us (depending on how quickly one level's).  <br />
 <br />
PvE farming has become fun again!</div></div><hr />

However they replaced it with a T5 equiv neck peice.  So all in all I think we picked up 12 epics in ZA in an hour and 20 mins or so.  <br />
<br />
So no mount, but much needed therapy after missing that fourth timer by a few seconds and/or minutes for the last two months or so....just never could get that push.  Somthing always would happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe i've had one of them in my bank for like 2-3 yrs !<br />
<br />
lol not used it in 2 yrs!<br />
<br />
i wish they would have made it so it could be used anywhere given not many people bother with AQ40 these days.  silly having a mount i can never use anymore :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I really like that mount.  Makes me feel like I'm in Starship Troopers.  Wish i could run around other places on it. The good thing is that it counts towards the 50 mount requirement for the Albino Drake :)<br />
 <br />
It was cool killing Twin Emps and C'Thun.  Never got that far pre-bc.  The C'Thun eye is trippy!</div></div><hr />
