<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinjiin</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the release of Tunare's Renewal I have been asked to be the main healer of some pick up groups, something I haven't done since around level 30.  Anyway, I am looking for some info/advice on healing our groups puller when using FD.<br />
<br />
If my monk/sk/necro pulls and is FD with mobs near him or her, I don't want to heal them, correct?  Should I wait for them to tell me to heal them?  Sometimes I see their FD fail and they are close to dieing, should I let them die?  These are real noob questions but then again the last time I was the only healer in a group was when I was a noob so I'm looking for suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriena</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Communication is huge. Don’t be afraid to ask or tell them up front to communicate with you on when it’s safe to heal. On raids, never heal a monk unless they say it’s ok. You either ask them “OK to heal?” or they tell you “Heal me”. The same rule generally applies to exp groups but to a lesser extent. If you are in a place that requires a lot of mob splitting then just don’t heal unless the monk is in camp fighting or they are fd. You will not gain agro if you heal a monk that is successfully feigned. If their fd fails and they are about to die….let them die. Death to a monk is not a big deal. In exp groups, just use your best judgment</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bizitt</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can heal a monk/sk/nec whenever they have successfully FD'ed and are still down. If a mob isn't beating on them, they have no aggro. They may still have aggro when they get back up, but as long as your heal doesn't land right when they get up, you'll be ok.<br />
<br />
If you don't want aggro (and I specify this because sometimes warriors/SKs/pallys (the &quot;tank&quot;) will deliberately heal/buff a puller on incoming to take the mobs' attention), don't heal when the puller is returning to camp with the mobs or the feign has failed. It sucks, yes, but if the puller has too many mobs, you will have to let him or her die. Most pullers accept this risk as part of their job. <br />
<br />
The safest way to go about it is to arrange for your puller to ask for a heal when it's safe (i.e., they're successfully FD). Another strategy that's sometimes used is deliberately taking aggro with a heal while they're not feigned/if feign failed and then kiting the mobs around your group for someone to peel off (obviously this only works in certain hunting grounds and for certain mobs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chenier</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I'm main healing in an xp group with a monk, I always talk with the monk and let him/her know that I like to know when they use mend and when it's back up again. I think that monks then appreciate that I'm watching them carefully so that they don't have to use mend while fighting in camp (unless of course things get ugly) and can use it on pulls if needed.<br />
<br />
Or, I can run out and toss them a quick heal if they need it while their splitting and if they get owie.<br />
<br />
Anyway, communication is good. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">01-14-2003, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking as a part time monk, the safest thing to do is just ask your fd puller.  As a healer, couple tips...  make sure you can see them before you heal... they may be a bit off trying a split or something, but if you see them back at your camp and starting to fight, chances are it's ok to heal.  Also, dont assume that a successful FD means you can heal right away... there may be spells being cast by the mob's that, when they land, will break the FD, and if you healed, you'll be on the aggro list.<br />
<br />
When I'm pulling on my monk, I have a hotkey that says to the group when I use my mend, and another hotkey for Ok to heal.  Dont be afraid to ask your puller to do something similar, as a mistake can lead to a wipe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milesgond</div><div class="date">01-15-2003, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">try stacking replenishment and natures recovery on the puller.  55 hp per tick is nice little regen.  natures recovery isn't useful very often, but I've found casting it on the FD puller can be helpful sometimes..  it's a pain how often you have to recast it, but if you get in the habit of recasting it every other pull or so it isn't so bad.  I like to use it anyway :)     of course if they're pulling mobs that hit for 500+ it's not going to make much difference ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bjond</div><div class="date">01-16-2003, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">.. while the monk is actually FD, you will not inherit any agro.  However, if the FD failed (fallen to ground), or if the FD was broken (MOB spell or fist hit monk after monk FD'd), or if the monk stands up just before your spell hits, then you WILL earn agro.  If the monk has to re-FD after any of that, you have just trained your group.<br />
<br />
As a monk, I generally do not want ANY healing, buffing, or songs running while I'm working a rough pull that requires a split.  I expect everyone to watch me die rather than kill themselves by trying to heal me.  Once I have the critter back to the group and I stop and start hitting it, then heal.  Make sure your monk is actually stopped and is fighting.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the pathing will be very buggy and so the monk might look like he's got a single and is running it to the group, but will turn around and then run back to check pathing and FD for the single to proximity agro in to the group.  The pathing is really only this bad in some Luclin areas.  Not sure on Pop, but from what I've seen so far PoP might be worse.<br />
<br />
IMHO, any xp spot that requires more than a couple FD's at the opening to perhaps space a spawn isn't worth the effort.  FD-split is a complete waste of time.  Much better XP is to be had from any zone where you can level pull or sneak toss something your group can handle.</div></div><hr />
