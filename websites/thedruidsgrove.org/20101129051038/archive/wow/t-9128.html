Im lvl 50 now so i figure i can be the most help to my team in Capture the Flag. Is the PvP set any good? Im a resto druid for the most part with innervate and all that...but im feral at heart. <br />
<br />
Also, where do i buy the PvP rewards i supposedly get? Not the rewards for reputation with silverwing but the overal Honor rewards. Thanks!<br />
<br />
P.S. sorry i start so many threads just trying to keep things interesting around here =D. :behindcom</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Below level 58, your CP gained is reduced below that of a level 60's CP gain.<br />
<br />
2.  Your gear is nowhere near what the level 60's have.  There is a huge difference.</div></div><hr />

Why would the CP gain be less if you are going against higher levels? I gain lots of points as a level 36 defending TM from raids.<br />
<br />
If you are level 50 now, then I would say now is a great time to do WSG because you will be going against 41-50's, not the 51-60's. Get in there and kick some butt.</div></div><hr />
