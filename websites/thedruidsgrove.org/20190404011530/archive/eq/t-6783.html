I've been trying to get him for weeks now, and he's always camped or not up. If anyone can help me out on Bristlebane by either letting me know when he's up or selling me a MQ, I'd be very grateful. Just send a tell to Deosil. And come on...someone needs to work on that Unkempt Druids quest more. Hehehe.</div></div><hr />

You kill his remains after handing him a globe of fire flies and a rez scroll or something like that. And then his remains drop the two stones needed, and that's it.</div></div><hr />

Nobody's keeping track of his spawn cycle anymore, and no one's selling MQs...so for the last two weeks, I've been sitting in Karnor's for a few hours a day waiting for him to spawn so I can get friends around to kill the spawned VS for the pieces.</div></div><hr />
