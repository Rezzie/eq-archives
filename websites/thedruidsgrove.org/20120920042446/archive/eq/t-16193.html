 For druids, this is relevant because all our damage spells are from old spell lines except for NBW and Spurs.  Even though Winter's Flame is a new line, it is balanced off of our normal nukes, so that doesn't count.<br />
 <br />
Personally, when I went all out vs a mob in TSS (before NBW came out), I did about 40% more dps than I did under comparible conditions in OoW. On the same token, warriors (a melee class that didn't recieve any dps disc upgrades between OOW and TSS) do about 175% more dps nowadays than they did in OoW.<br />
 <br />
 Back to casters -- The reasons why (ie) wizards and necros are able to do double+ the dps nowadays than they did during OOW is because they often get new spell lines added, which boosts their damage greatly. If necros and wizards were reliant on old spell lines to produce damage, their damage would be subpar.<br />
 <br />
 If other people agree, maybe further investigation can be done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to see a Dawnstrike upgrade replace our normal fire DD.  Having both is pointless since people are only apt to cast the Dawnstrike verison anyway.<br />
<br />
A Cold verison of NBW would be nice.  I think we have room to argue for this as it seems Wizards are getting a cold verison of EC in SoF.<br />

Druid DPS, even with NBW and Fernspur, is woeful.  Utterly, utterly woeful.<br />
<br />
I can, at best, produce 40% of the DPS of a similarly equipped/aa'd wizard (anguish level guild).<br />
<br />
That's just not right.  <br />
<br />
I am not holding my breath for it to change, though.  Druids seem destined to be forced further into the role of healers (but damned if we'll be given the tools to do this job properly either - god forbid we come remotely close to a cleric's ability!!!)</div></div><hr />
