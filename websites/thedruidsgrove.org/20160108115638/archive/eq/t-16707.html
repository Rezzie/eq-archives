I had to log within about 30 minutes with no response, but when I got back 3 hours later I was surprised by a response from a GM.  I was kind of bummed, thinking I had missed my chance and was trying to figure what the odds were that I could get two responses in a row.  Within 30 minutes of sending another notice, and indicating I would be in game for a while, I had a GM contact me and help out.  <br />

Basically, I was told that there is a bug in this part of the quest and was given the ending combine (which I don't recall what it is atm).</div></div><hr />
