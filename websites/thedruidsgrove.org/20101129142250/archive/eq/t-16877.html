Dwight Eisenhower's granddaughter, William F. Buckley's son, several republican congressmen (former I think), Colin Powel...<br />
<br />
Lets see, who else?<br />
<br />
http://www.republicansforobama.org/?q=node/3341<br />
Elected Officials: <br />
<br />
Jim Leach, Former Congressman from Iowa<br />
<br />
    &quot;For me, the national interest comes before party concerns, particularly internationally.  We do need a new direction in American policy, and Obama has a sense of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lincoln Chafee, Former United States Senator from Rhode Island<br />
<br />
    &quot;As I look at the candidates in order who to vote for, certainly my kind of conservatism was reflected with Senator Obama, and those points are that we're fiscally conservative, we care about revenues matching expenditures, we also care about the environment, I think it's a traditional conservative value to care about clean air and clean water.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wayne Gilchrest, Congressman from Maryland<br />
<br />
    &quot;We can't use four more years of the same kind of policy that's somewhat haphazard, which leads to recklessness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Richard Riordan, Former Mayor of Los Angeles<br />
<br />
    &quot;I'm still a Republican, but I still will always vote for the person who I think will do the best job.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lowell Weicker, Former Governor and Senator from Connecticut<br />
<br />
    &quot;At issue is not the partisan politics of two parties, rather the image we have of ourselves as Americans.  Senator Obama brings wisdom, kindness, and common sense to what is both his and our quest for a better America.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim Whitaker, Fairbanks, Alaska Mayor<br />
<br />
    &quot;If we are as a nation concerned with energy, then our consideration should be a national energy policy that is not predicated on crude oil 50 years into the future.  We need to get to it, and I think Barack Obama is very clear in that regard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linwood Holton, Former Governor of Virginia<br />
<br />
    &quot;Obama has a brain, and he isn't afraid to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Government Officials: <br />
<br />
Colin Powell, Secretary of State under Bush 43 <br />
<br />
    &quot;...he has met the standard of being a sucessful president, being an exceptional president.  I think he is a transformational figure.  He is a new generation coming into the world-- onto the world state, onto the American stage, and for that reason I'll be voting for Senator Barack Obama.&quot;<br />
<br />
Douglas Kmiec, Head of the Office of Legal Counsel under Reagan &amp; Bush 41 <br />
<br />
    &quot;I was first attracted to government by Ronald Reagan, who lives in our national memory as a great leader and an inspiring communicator.  Senator Obama has these gifts as well, but of course, more rhetorical flourish without substance would be worth little.  Is there more to Senator Obama?  I believe there is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson M. Andrews, Republican Counsel to the U.S. Senate<br />
<br />
    &quot;Barack Obama is a thoughtful visionary leader who as President will end the decline of American law, liberty, and fiscal responsibility that are the hallmarks of the extremist policies of the current Administration, now adopted by John McCain.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Susan Eisenhower, Granddaughter of President Eisenhower &amp; President of the Eisenhower Group<br />
<br />
    &quot;Given Obama's support among young people, I believe that he will be most invested in defending the interests of these rising generations and, therefore, the long-term interests of this nation as a whole.&quot;<br />
<br />
Francis Fukuyama, Advisor to President Reagan<br />
<br />
    &quot;...Obama probably has the greatest promise of delivering a different kind of politics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rita Hauser, Former White House intelligence advisor under George W. Bush <br />
<br />
    &quot;McCain will continue the wrong-headed foreign policy decisions of Bush, while Obama will take us in a new direction.&quot;<br />
<br />
Larry Hunter, Former President Reagan Policy Advisor<br />
<br />
    &quot;I suspect Obama is more free-market friendly than he lets on.  He taught at the University of Chicago, a hotbed of right-of-center thought.  His economic advisers, notably Austan Goolsbee, recognize that ordinary citizens stand to gain more from open markets than from government meddling.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill Ruckelshaus, served in the Nixon and Reagan administrations<br />
<br />
    &quot;I'm not against McCain, I'm for Obama.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken Adelman, served in the Ford administration<br />
<br />
    &quot;The most important decision John McCain made in his long campaign was deciding on a running mate.  That decision showed appalling lack of judgment... that selection contradicted McCain's main two, and best two, themes for his campaign-- Country First, and experience counts.  Neither can he credibly claim, post-Palin pick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilibet Hagel, Wife of Republican Senator Chuck Hagel<br />
<br />
    &quot;This election is not about fighting phantom issues churned out by a top-notch slander machine.  Most important, it is not about distracting the public-- you and me-- with whatever slurs someone thinks will stick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Columnists and Academics:<br />
<br />
Jeffrey Hart, National Review Senior Editor  <br />
<br />
    &quot;It turns out that these political parties are not always either liberal or conservative, Democratic or Republican.  The Democrat, under certain conditions, can be the conservative.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew Bacevich, Professor of International Relations at Boston University<br />
<br />
    &quot;For conservatives, Obama represents a sliver of hope.  McCain represents none at all.  The choice turns out to be an easy one.&quot;<br />
<br />
David Friedman, Economist and son of Milton and Rose Friedman<br />
<br />
    &quot;I hope Obama wins.  President Bush has clearly been a disaster from the standpoint of libertarians and conservatives because he has presided over an astonishing rise in government spending.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christopher Buckley, Son of National Review founder William F. Buckley &amp; former NR columnist<br />
<br />
    &quot;Obama has in him-- I think, despite his sometimes airy-fairy 'We are the people we have been waiting for' silly rehtoric-- the potential to be a good, perhaps even great leader.  He is, it seems clear enough, what the historical moment seems to be calling for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew Sullivan, Columnist for the Atlantic Monthly<br />
<br />
    &quot;Obama's legislative record, speeches, and the way he has run his campaign reveal, I think, a very even temperament, a very sound judgment, and an intelligent pragmatism.  Prudence is a word that is not inappropriate to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wick Alison, Former publisher of the National Review<br />
<br />
    &quot;I made the maximum donation to John McCain during the primaries, when there was still hope he might come to his senses.  But I now see that Obama is almost the ideal candidate for this moment in American history.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael Smerconish, Columnist for the Philadelphia Enquirer<br />
<br />
    &quot;...an Obama presidency holds the greatest chance for unifying us here at home and restoring our prestige around the globe.&quot;</div></div><hr />

WEDNESDAY: Updated Endorsement Tally -- Obama Leads 124-46 (http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003875230)<br />
<br />
&quot;At least 27 papers have now switched to Obama from Bush in 2004, with just four flipping to McCain&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woldar</div><div class="date">10-23-2008, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I expect him to win even though the race is getting tighter.  He will be a one term president though.  The shinny newness will soon wear off.  The crowds of brain washed obamozobbies will be disappointed within the year.  The first big crisis that he scews up or all the new taxes will start to take a bite.</div></div><hr />

If any party could botch this election at this point, it would be the Democrats.  While Obama and his campaign are fairly disciplined I wouldn't put it past some other Democrat to do/say something to hurt his chances.</div></div><hr />

Whoever the next president is they are going to have their work cut out for them.  Bush has left the country in bad shape and there are no quick fixes to make it all better.</div></div><hr />

He is primed for a repeat of poor Jimmy Carter unfortunately. Carter wasn't that bad of a president as people thought, he just got the bad end of some sticks from prior administrations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-25-2008, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I can't imagine the next 4 years in this country are going to be easy years at all.  I'm starting to hear more people talk about the coming recession is going to be bigger than a recession... they're saying the &quot;d&quot; word from time to time.<br />
<br />
Glad my parents didn't live to see that.  You shouldn't have to experience more than one of them per lifetime.</div></div><hr />
