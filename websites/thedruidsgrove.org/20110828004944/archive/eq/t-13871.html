As of now I have only one LDoN under my belt and one aug (forgot the name, +4 PR on Xanthe's earring) from the expansion. So anything including aug advice would be helpful.<br />

The pants you'll keep forever at least bagged.  For augs, if you're able to do lots of LDoNs and your wisdom isn't maxed yet, you can go for wisdom augs.  Also you might look into saving points for LDoN items you can fit the LDoN mana regen augs in.  Mana regen is &lt;3.  Another possibility is the DoN cultural armor and augs if ya have some plat to spend.</div></div><hr />

There is a seal aug that you can get by winning the drop from all 3 missions that is just amazing. The best thing is that there are three levels of this aug, one for level 45ish, one for 55ish and top one ofr 65ish.<br />
<br />
The top aug gives 14ac, 70hp, 70mana plus other stats, the lower augs are 10/50/50 and 12/60/60.  This is definitely a set of Mm that lower levels will want to do over and over again.<br />
<br />
Also, dain 2 and 3 there are hp augs as possible loot drops as well, again these scale up/ down to the level of the player....so doing dain missions from 45+ you can easily get all the visible armor aug slots taken care of for a long time.<br />

I've done a bit of upgrading in the meantime, got a scarred browband (100 plat now, not bad), some better shoulders, and a fully powered Slipgear's Gem.<br />
 <br />
A question, though. I bought some radiant crystals to grab some DoN stuff, but they're not showing up when I go to a vendor. Do I need to do the faction quests first, and if so are there any I can do at 52?</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm... I'm assuming you bought radiant crystals... if so, the only vendor you can get loot from is Tatsujiro the Serene, located in Lavastorm Mountains.<br />

Sorry if you already knew this and feel insulted, just the way you said &quot;I go to A vendor&quot; and not &quot;to THE vendor&quot; made me wonder...</div></div><hr />

This happened to me the first time I bought crystals.  When you buy them, they are in a bag in inventory, but to spend them, they have to appear in the crystals box in your inventory window.  To get them there, hit the &quot;reclaim&quot; button in your inventory window.<br />

Dain 1 takes 5 ppl to do and about 30 mins,  and drops a nice shield as a common drop that would be a upgrade.  I still do it for decent and easy aa's (90% aa at lvl 70).<br />

You can usually pick up a tainted heartstone for charm slot cheap in baz (100p on dro) and stats are not bad when you learn all uncommon languages.  Took me a few hours to max out.  <br />
 <br />
You said you bought crystals,  not sure what your money situation is,  you may consider just picking up OoW tradeskill armor,  cant remember what leather version is called,  full suit run ya around 30-40k.  Feran maybe?</div></div><hr />
