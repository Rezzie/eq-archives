<br />
Does anyone have any experience of healing a lower level party?  I raid with my friends on our level 70 toons but a couple of them need to go to Scholo on their lower level alts and want me to go with them.  I'm thinking that a couple of heals are soon going to rip the mobs off the tank (level 58).  If you've healed lower level party's how have you adapted your play?  I'm thinking of casting lower rank spells (any suggestions of ranks to cast would be appreciated) or letting the tank's health get lower than usual before putting some HoTs on him.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<br />
First of all, tranquility will heal most lowbies to full health in a single tick.  So barkskin + tranquility saves your entire party in an emergency, but then obviously you have to deal with mass aggro unless you have tranquility talented.<br />
<br />
Second, you will notice that lifebloom doesn't work at all on anyone below level 56 (i think?), so make sure you don't rely on that only to be surprised when it doesn't work at a crucial moment.  Trying to cast lifebloom on someone below level 56 returns the error message &quot;target is too low level&quot; or something similar.<br />
<br />
I would say just downrank your heals.  Rank 3 healing touch has a short cast time and in level 70 healing gear will still be significant enough an amount of healing to be useful.  If you find rank 3 isn't enough, rank 4 also has a reduced cast time.<br />
<br />
[edit - Just re-read the subject of your post.  Just go for normal rank healing over times if you're healing 58-60]<br />

Because I play with some  lower levels (healing for DM, for example), I keep my lower ranks of Healing Touch accessible. Most of these folks don't need the big hit. Tranquility rocks...as long as I can get some protection.</div></div><hr />

You should also have enough HP that even if you get aggro, you can take a few hits and lol @ the mob.</div></div><hr />

I was in a 3-player PUG that got wiped in the part of DM with goblin-conjured golems. I kept backing up the ramp, hoping the pallys I was with would just pull their targets back. Ended up dying first with 4 of the golems surrounding me. Both pallys could rez me, but I couldn't keep 'em alive long enough. Just got swamed with poor planning and play. :frown:</div></div><hr />
