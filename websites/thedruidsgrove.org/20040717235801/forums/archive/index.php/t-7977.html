 A message that you sent could not be delivered to one or more of its recipients. This is a permanent error. The following address(es) failed:<br />
  <br />
    soandso@someisp.com<br />
      SMTP error from remote mailer after RCPT TO:&lt;soandso @someisp.com=&quot;&quot;&gt;:<br />
      host mail.netscape.everyone.net [216.200.145.10]:<br />
      550 Recipient Rejected: This user does not have an account here  Okay let me be very blunt!!!<br />
   <br />
   If you do not use a valid email address that you can actual receive mail on... you will not be able to post and will be stuck in limbo till you send me an email or use the forum provided for non-registered or awaiting email response members.<br />
   <br />
   Its that simple! - If your worried about privacy.. then go get a hotmail or yahoo account.. we just need a Valid email. <br />
   <br />
 If your having problems I have a forum JUST for you.. no one sees it but non-registered or awaiting emails members.. its at the bottom of the forum list.. you can actual post there.. its Moderated post but I get an email when you post so some lame butt doesn't put porn on it.. /shrugs.<br />
   <br />
   So bottomline .. <br />
   <br />
   A.) Valid Email Address is required to post on the grove<br />
 B.) Test it with your main account so you know you can get email on that valid email address.. you may find that its no longer valid.<br />
   <br />
 Simple as that.. no one see's that email but the staff,.. the only email members get from us is a HAPPY BIRTHDAY email... and thats because its a special day and quite frankly its just cool!<br />
   <br />
   And if you don't want that email .. don't put in a Birthdate :)<br />
   <br />
   Thanks for listening!&lt;/soandso&gt;</div></div><hr />
