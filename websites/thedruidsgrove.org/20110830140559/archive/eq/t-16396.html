<br />
What is it?<br />
Tango is an Everquest log parser. Not just a damage parser or a DPS parser; it has capabilities and features that go beyond just that.<br />
<br />
Tango can monitor your Everquest log file and react to different events in several ways including playing a .wav file, speech, incrementing counters, or setting alarms that will trigger in the future. In this way, Tango is similar to Everquest's own audio triggers but allows much more versatility.<br />
<br />
As well as the above, Tango is a very capable combat parser. Along with the usual statistics available in most parsers, Tango includes graphing functionality by the second for attacks, damage, spells, AAs, discs and other (configurable) effects.<br />

Requirements<br />
To use Tango, you must have at least Windows XP/Vista, .NET 2.0 installed, and logging turned on in Everquest. Optionally, you must have SAPI installed for speech related features.<br />
<br />
  The .NET 2.0 Framework can be downloaded here (Note: Vista comes with 2.0 pre-installed):<br />
<br />
  .NET 2.0 Framework, 32 bit (x86) (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en) or<br />
  .NET 2.0 Framework, 64 bit (x64) (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=B44A0000-ACF8-4FA1-AFFB-40E78D788B00&amp;displaylang=en)<br />
<br />
  Tango optionally uses MS SAPI for speech.<br />
<br />
  XP/Vista come with SAPI with one voice. You should not need to download anything extra.<br />
  To control various aspects of the voice use Start-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Speech.<br />
  If interested, more voices can be found at MS SAPI (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=5E86EC97-40A7-453F-B0EE-6583171B4530&amp;amp;displaylang=en) or NextUp.com (http://nextup.com/TextAloud/SpeechEngine/voices.html).<br />

It's definately sophisticated but it's the simple things in GamParse that I like, such as being able to sort by whatever I want instead of only being able to sort it by mobs I did the most damage on.  GamParse allows you to keep it chronological instead of having to hunt through the list to see what you just did.<br />
 <br />
I don't know how the current default sort is useful to be honest.  If I have an annihilate proc I can show up to 2k dps in a fight, and that's what floats and stays at the top of the list.<br />
 <br />
Also, at least for me it didn't auto-refresh the list unless I double clicked my name.  Is it supposed to be like that?<br />
 <br />
I thought the graphing capabilities were really cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
auto refresh how? i am not sure how you are using it. normally i just keep the enemies tab open, are you using the friends tab and just selecting yourself?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
GamParse allows you to select which column to sort by.  My only complaint there is that you can't sort descending.  Ideally I'd love a parser that allowed me to always see the LAST mob fight at the top and on down to the first.<br />
 <br />
I am selecting myself in the left tab, with my damage done to mobs in the details tab (the one on the right).  I have the melee hits filter on most of the time so parsing everyone wouldn't show up accurately anyway.  Maybe it was a settings issue, but new fights weren't populating themselves and appending to the list in real time while monitoring.  I had to double click my name to get it to refresh.</div></div><hr />
