<br />
I have been away from eq for a long time and it looks like a whole new game now. I have a 58 druid with what used to be great equipment when i played, but everything has changed.... can anyone update me on the Expansion, good quest and good zones that i can group/solo in now a days? <br />

Things like these. There's a LOT of content in EQ so it's hard to say.<br />
<br />
What expansions do you have? OoW is a great expansion to have for the lvl 70 increase, as well as some good solo spots. DoN is a great place to group up and get good equipment, as well as the last one DoD, which has great equipment rewards when you finish missions. You're lvl 58 so, I'm assuming you may want OoW for now.<br />
<br />
Take a look for Everquest Titanium which has every expansion released up to now for only 20 bucks. Should have been released this week.</div></div><hr />

Play A REAL Druid. One that is challenging, Fun to play, Non Linear talents, and you can gear the way YOU want to play not the way everyone tells you how to play.<br />

A WoW Druid :texla: <br />

<br />
As for me trying to be like everyone else...not true... there are just some zones that I wouldnt know about since I have been gone for so long.. Iam not trying to follow in people footsteps just trying to find some good zone that I prob havnt seen since i have been gone.</div></div><hr />

If so you might wanna get DoD and/or the upcoming february expansion.</div></div><hr />

You will play any needed class in this mission. It will be hard to become a skilled Druid if you do mostly Monstermissions. But as always it depends on the Time you could spend ingame:cool:</div></div><hr />
