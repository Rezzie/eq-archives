<br />
Theyre so hard. Beast-specced ones: u cant do anything about their pet, but try to ignore it, thinking 'no pain!' to urself. <br />
<br />
Anyways, this strategy works once in a while, because in cat-form, u can kill the hunter quicker than he and his pet can kill u.<br />
<br />
Good for us!<br />
<br />
However, the hunter I fought changed strategy, and when they do that, i dont have a clue of what to do: He started kiting me using his scattershot (i think thats the one slowing movement speed) and suddenly my only way to reach him was nukes or root. and nukes just dont suffice and root better stick for the whole 20 seconds AND u better crit a hellaffalot  otherwise u just end up being kited again when root breaks.</div></div><hr />

Scattershot cool down is reasonably long (though i dont remember the specific timer) between that, root (though with Aspect of Nature, if the hunter is smart, root sometimes is unreliable. Hibernate on the pet for the same reason (plus new pet abilities). sometimes, if im stuck in caster gear, i switch to bear to stun if  ihave enough health still, i switch to cat, run behind him and backstab. <br />
<br />
I have mixed results vs hunters, it varies greatly based on their spec and equipment compared to mine :/ I would say im 40/60 vs hunters 40% win at most, and 60% loss at best.</div></div><hr />

I don't duel and unlike this encounter last night I don't get the chance to pvp one on one, so I don't have tactics down for particular situations. He and his bear came at me from a distance so I had time to cast hibernate, which seemed to work for about 2 seconds or so only. By the time I went cat to attack the hunter, I had cast moonfire on him and he had gotten a few shots into me. As soon as I reached him and started to attack, he meleed me with something which allowed him to get back to range. The bear was on me and he was at range shooting. My health was about 50% at this point and I panicked. I attempted to cast a heal on myself and nothing happened. Wouldnt cast. Just a few seconds later, I am dead and he is dancing on me. What the hell happened?<br />
<br />
Maybe I need to practice dueling.<br />
<br />
Give me some strategies. <br />
I disagree that we can kill a hunter while in cat form faster than he and his pet can kill us. Our armor is little better than leather in cat while the hunter has mail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">11-14-2005, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">he hamstringed you, reducing your movement speed by 50%, which allowed him to get range from which he could shoot you.  you can shift out of it, and feral charge regardless of it.  <br />
<br />
as for dueling a hunter, if they are competent i don't think we can win.  they will put aspect of the wild on to negate any cc we attempt on the pet.  they can scare beast, which fears you in a form, which is something a smart hunter will only try if you are dazed.  you can see this coming by the black glowing of a hunter's hands, like any other shadow spell.  they can also feign death to break combat and then immediately plant a frost trap to get range/aim shot you, so if a hunter feigns death while you are fighting them, do not run directly at them.  <br />
<br />
if you run into them out in the world and they are not ready for you, you have a pretty good chance of winning.  open in cat to get some DoTs on him if you like, but then stay in bear and stay in his face as much as possible.  keep your health up as well; hunters can do great burst dps, and they can also stun you.  a non-cced pet is like a furry little DoT, so try to keep it cced, but if you can't mitigate its damage with a rejuv when you get the chance.  most of them panic when they find they cant get range on you to shoot you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at lower levels, i learnt how to do hunters by hibernating pet and putting myself in the hunters deadzone, but my dps with nukes is not nearly good enough no more to do that trick, so i think ill have to try some feral charging next time.<br />
<br />
thx for advices!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">11-14-2005, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's a good idea to always have an abolish poison up if you are in caster form vs a hunter.  it costs very little mana and lasts 8 sec.  in my experience, most hunters who viper sting you and see it removed quickly may try once or twice more, but then they give up and focus on another method of killing you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-14-2005, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had good success against hunters.  Best bet of course is to get the jump on them with a ravage which hurts them pretty badly.  If they are BM specced they wont' do very good damage themselves, if they aren't BM specced you can hibernate/root the pet off(you can even if they are BM specced, they are only gods for a few seconds and then can't use it again for a couple minutes).   Stay bear form, get as many hits in as you can, when he starts to cast scare beast(hope you downloaded spell alert!) go caster and moonfire or heal yourself.  Feral charge every single time it comes up to keep close to him.  I have 49% absorption and it just takes them too long to kill me in general as their dmg isn't all that great against plate level armor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with all feedback here. If you can, open with can and try and tear a big hole in them right off the bat. Sleep/root the pet asap, if possilbe. Be sure and cast Abolish poison whenever you shift, moonfire, barkskin, heal if needed then feral charge to get close, rinse and repeat. after the cat opener I stay bear for most or all of the fight except when I need to shift to heal or break snare effects. Or if it is going very well I'll go cat for the quicker kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ender</div><div class="date">11-15-2005, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beat a 60 hunter last night in a duel (I'm 54), he was BM specced.   Was a very close fight though.  Key seems to be bear form, they just can't deal with someone who can't be kited and has really high armor.</div></div><hr />

I can't see how spamming claw loses to him mauling me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">11-20-2005, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been leveling my hunter a lot since 1.8 came out.  With the talent changes in 1.7, Beast Spec is very viable.<br />
<br />
Scattershot is on a 30 sec cooldown (like FD) and has a disorient effect identical to a rogue's blind, but shorter duration (about 4-6 seconds). It works at close ranges against rogues who would ambush me, and up to 21 yards to interrupt casters (hunter's only interrupt except for a lucky improved concussive shot, or beast intimidate/stun which is a 26 point talent). This ability is such a lifesaver, I can't imagine any hunter not having it for both PvE and PvP.  Like Blind, any damage caused to the target will break the effect.<br />
<br />
Long story short - the only 1 on 1 PvP encounter my hunter has lost since level 30 was once against another hunter and once against a warrior who got the drop on me and resisted a freeze trap.  I've beat rogues of +5 level, and a Mage who was +7.<br />
<br />
Druids who wanted to go toe to toe with me in Feral have been quickly feared and dispatched.  Druids may escape me from time to time, but they need to run pretty quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">11-21-2005, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually don't have any problems with hunters, really. Shadowmeld + Hibernate the pet as a start.. if it doesnt work or whatever the key thing against a hunter is NEVER LET HIM KITE YOU. They do insane damage with end-game gear at a distance.<br />
I use the same strat as mentioned.. Feral Charge all the way baby. Being trapped isn't a problem really.. the aimed shot at you in bear is still only pshysical damage and nothing more than a itchy mosquito bite really (at least for me with ~65% dam reduct). :)<br />
And, as said, get spellalert so that you can casterform when he casts Scare Beast. And if you're planning on staying much in caster form, removing viper sting is a priority.</div></div><hr />
