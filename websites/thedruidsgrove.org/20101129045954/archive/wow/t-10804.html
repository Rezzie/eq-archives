<br />
I've seen a FEW good pvpers around low 20 who actually work together and helped me capture a few flags.<br />
<br />
I dread the time I join a pvp instance and I see everyones a buncha lowbies-It means i'm gonna get my ass handed to me<br />
<br />
I tend to be a high priority target in pvp instances after the first 10 mins.<br />
<br />
It was particularly annoying when a 23 dwarf hunter kept bragging how he suprisingly got most honor kills. No kidding, I beat up the guys and get grouped on while he takes the sliver of hp left on the guy. The horde just ignored everyone else and just ganged up on me, even in bear form! You know its bad when the horde singles you out in bear form and completely ignores everyone else on your team and beat on you -_-;<br />
<br />
Admittedly I was the only one that got near their flag or was able to solo anyone but...cmon-ignoring them cloth and other leather users while i'm in bear form is just frustrating.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also when theres a pvp skirmish going on and suddenly they risk death to go after me as if I dropped rare loot!! &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do agree to this in a certain way. <br />
I am playing at the EU server tho, but who cares :)<br />
<br />
I am currently lvl 38 and got my corporal rank. When I'm in WSG, all the alliance dont care about the flag - they just want their kills. All the horde must use teamspeak or whatever?, because they rock ass on WSG. I have won 1 WSG fight ever.<br />
<br />
Its kinda boring when I ALWAYS pick up the flag - but when my allies see me come out, they continue their fight - even if horde's are chasing me.. <br />
Kinda boring since the honor of winning a WSG is good, or am I wrong on this?</div></div><hr />

I also think the biggest problem is lack of teamwork and communication.  The best way to solve that is join as a group with people you know and get everyone one TS or Vent.  Problem is unless its a twink team, alliance usually won't stay grouped for the 30 mins to an hour the queue takes to run, because they want to be out leveling or whatever.</div></div><hr />
