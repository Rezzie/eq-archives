<br />
i was mentioning in my return of the worst dps thread about a new 80 warrior we have.<br />
<br />
anyone give some ballpark figures for a warrior to tank in heroics ?<br />
<br />
obviously uncrittable...<br />
<br />
stam ?<br />
armour<br />
def<br />
<br />
at the moment he says he has :<br />
<br />
23472 hp<br />
19926 armour<br />
15.3% dodge<br />
13.44% parry<br />
9.72% block<br />

<br />
(might be 535 for heroics for Defense...I don't recall exactly, but 540 is pretty solid goal).<br />
<br />
Our guild's raid tank has these stats...He was similar to this though, when he started to tank heroics...he had a little less stam and armor, but he got Defense Capped before trying to tank any heroics and I know his avoidance was quite high.<br />
# Health: 27791<br />
# Armor: 23374<br />
# Defense: 547<br />
# Dodge: 25.79%<br />
# Parry: 17.55%<br />
# Block: 19.72%<br />

Why?  What's up?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i know he is trying to get enchants done to make him uncrittable with more +def.<br />
<br />
so that shows he has a long way to go but against a raid tank its nots surprising.<br />
<br />
we're trying to get him with us in heroics that drop good plate items.<br />
<br />
i know he wants some epic shield that i think he said was from CoS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-22-2009, 12:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should take him as DPS and allow him to roll on tanking items until he's ready to go.

oh indeed Des, that's what we are doing - he's not tanking yet !<br />
<br />
i was merely wondering what sorta stats he should have before we let him try some tanking....maybe in UK ?<br />
<br />
We are trying to get him some nice items. he's picked up a couple ilvl 200 blues.....and the bolstered legplates iir.<br />
<br />
Same with our druid - she is not tanking yet although she has some nice crafted items and she has the Death Warmed something or other from Uldaur crafted !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well as mentioned elsewhere he is now tanking and doing pretty well.<br />
<br />
i will recheck his stats this week.  its funny since we started taking him to 5 mans, plus a couple other people who are also plate wearers and need gear plate does not drop now ! :(<br />
<br />
Another Warrior question -<br />
<br />
Can anyone say the best opening moves for a warrior to generate threat on multi mobs ?<br />
<br />
I'm finding i am really needing to hold back on the aoe with him tanking atm....i dont know beans about a warrior so not entirely sure what he should be using.<br />
<br />
Are warriors viewed as being behind as aoe tanks atm ?<br />
<br />
Not sure if its his stats not giving him the ability to generate enough....STR ? or his rotation etc which will come with practice ?<br />
<br />
I'm too used to the 2 DK's we run wih doing Howling something or other plus the D&amp;D which means i just open up all guns blazing 0.2 seconds after they pull !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors aren't necessarily &quot;bad&quot; AoE tanks...<br />
<br />
hehe Ok, they're not the best.<br />
<br />
I found this thread:  http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4463906358&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
And thought it might be useful (particularly the last page or two lol)<br />
<br />
Seems like Thunderclap and Cleave are the big ones to use.  I imagine you could have him tab target once he's gotten a decent amount of threat on his first target.<br />
<br />
I think the hard part is that the warriors aren't like pallies or DK's.   So they don't really have a big AoE to throw out there instantly (Like Consecrate and Death and Decay)...=(  <br />
<br />
He can do it.  Just needs to practice a bit and figure out what works.  <br />
<br />
I wish I knew more about end game with a prot warrior to be able to help out more.  My silly warrior is only level 30something right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryan4nayr</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've found that initial rage is key. I personally spam Berserker Rage (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=18499) for more rage as warriors can never have enough (keeping Bloodrage (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=2687) for those awful avoidance streaks, changing in 3.2). Pulling with Charge (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=11578) via the Warbringer (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=57499) talent gives initial 15 rage, and with every decent prot warrior going the Deep Wounds (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=12867) side-route, the extra 10 rage in Imp. Charge (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=12697) gives flexibility with a Thunder Clap (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=11581) / Shockwave (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=46968) opener. Tankspot.com used to have a video showing all these wonderful warrior pulling tricks (http://www.tankspot.com/forums/f160/40785-warrior-pulling-guide.html), but FileFront seems to have lost it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Tankspot.com, I'd recommend a quick read of their priority flowchart (http://www.tankspot.com/forums/f14/41426-ideal-warrior-single-target-threat-rotation.html) as a rough guideline for good tps. For AOE situations, just like in TBC, frenetic target-tabbing -&gt; (high threat skill) is still needed. In TBC it was mostly Devastate (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47498), nowadays it's mostly Shield Slam (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47488), both with Heroic Strike (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47450) woven as much as possible; post-3.2, this may or may not change.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, in contrast to the frenetic key-mashing, Paladins have Hammer of the Righteous, Consecration, etc. in precise rotation. This is why I don't like tanking on the warrior at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-04-2009, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks both.  i will check out those sites and point him towards them to.<br />
<br />
so he has to get into alt+tab really to generate proper threat on multi mobs ?  <br />
<br />
he sometimes charges in to pull or he pulls by shooting a mob.<br />
<br />
i need to look more at wot thunderclap and cleave actually do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-04-2009, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cleave: A sweeping attack that does your weapon damage plus 222 to the target and his nearest ally.<br />
<br />
Thunderclap: Blasts nearby enemies increasing the time between their attacks by 10% for 30 sec and doing 300 damage to them.  Damage increased by attack power.  This ability causes additional threat.<br />
<br />
Cleave is kind of like Maul + the Glyph of Maul for bears.<br />
<br />
Thunderclap is sort of like a Tauren's war stomp, for lack of a better idea on how to explain it.  Thunderclap is a fun, flashy BOOM kinda move.  Rage cost is 20, not sure if that's reduced by talents or not.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine even if your warrior tank opens up with charge and his enrage ability- it might still be safer to hold back a bit on opening up with AoE nukefests for a second or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryan4nayr</div><div class="date">08-04-2009, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Talented (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=12666) TC (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47502) gives decent threat within its 8 yards (10 yds. glyphed (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43399), about same threat as a Heroic Strike), but during the 6s cooldown, your high-crit dps party members can quickly pass it. Cleave (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47520) is limited to 2 targets (3 targets glyphed (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43414)); it's great hitting a different 2nd/3rd mob when tab-targeting -&gt; Cleave.<br />
<br />
A warrior's highest threat, (spammable) skills are Shield Slam (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47488), Revenge (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=57823) and Heroic Strike (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47450), so tabing to different targets to apply these would be very helpful.<br />
<br />
But patch 3.2 is running now so a lot of these could change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I'd really enjoy tanking with my warrior if I could get a solid grasp of it.  Bear tanking is sooo easy.  Swipe /dance Swipe Maul, Mangle WIN<br />
<br />
Warrior tanking (mind you, my warrior is only 30-ish), seems like it would be loads of fun.  I just don't understand it very much just yet, so I went Arms with her for leveling =)</div></div><hr />

Cleave - can this hit targets in a 360 degree around the warrior ? ie behind him ?<br />
<br />
TC - 360 degree ? seems the glyph would be useful here to add even another 2 yrds ?<br />
<br />
Shield Slam / Revenge / Heroic Strike - all single target i assume ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ryan4nayr</div><div class="date">08-05-2009, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TBH, Kheldar, I'm not sure if Cleave covers 360 degrees. Ideally I would only tank things in front to parry incoming attacks. There was a raid boss in TBC with a fairly wicked cleaving attack that hit 360 degrees, so Blizzard fixed the range check(s) of this NPC cleave dealing damage to the front only. I am not sure if this &quot;fix&quot; also affected warrior Cleave.<br />
<br />
However TC thankfully hits all around. Its glyph is nice but frankly it's used more due to lack of good choices that plague most classes.<br />
<br />
Shield Slam / Revenge / Heroic Strike - all single target i assume ?<br />
Right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-06-2009, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks ryan.<br />
<br />
with a DK tanking and throwing down D&amp;D we've not really worried where additional mobs are, or if one gets behind him for a bit.<br />
<br />
i'll point him towards a glyph for TC then :)<br />
<br />
So with those single target abilities it is about rotation and tabbing to other targets in a 3 or 4 mob pull to make sure he holds them when i open up with hurricane (and the lock or mage with their aoe).</div></div><hr />
