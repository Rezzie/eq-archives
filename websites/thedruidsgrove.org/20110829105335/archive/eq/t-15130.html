Do you have a budget on how much you want to spend ?<br />
<br />
A very quick and easy upgrade is to purchase some Runeseeker gear (I think thats the one for Half Elves) + Symbols, if you go for Master's instead of Grandmaster's you can get it much cheaper and still get some decent upgrades.<br />
<br />
Buy some radiant crystals and purchase missing Focus Effects from DoN Merchants, there only go to level 70 but every little bit helps and crystals are fairly cheap these days.<br />
<br />
If you are into DoD missions then check out http://samanna.net/gen.info/prog.dod.shtml , lists rewards for each mission and also has information about PoR and TSS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">12-28-2006, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Depending on how much cash you have, and since I see you already have one of the Tanned Leather Dragonhide Bracers from the DoN camp in Lavastorm, you can grab a few other pieces, like the gloves, chest, leggings, and another bracer to upgrade to be a little more ready to go out and farm other gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">berdar</div><div class="date">12-28-2006, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This toon has about 50K to play with.<br />
<br />
<br />
He does some solo, but groups  wherever he can find one.   WOS and Steppes lately, but not opposed to going anywhere or taking the time to do any quests for armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seeker</div><div class="date">12-29-2006, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have a look at the following quests :-<br />
 <br />
Back - Crimson Cloak of Moonwaters (soloable)<br />
very simple quest http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=50811<br />
<br />
Wrist - Fieldwarden's Bracer<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52392, nice mana regen and sometimes people are letting the hides rot<br />
<br />
Ear - Relic Shopkeeper's Earring<br />
Kill stuff &amp; loot in Arcstone http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=48059<br />
<br />
Aug - Relic Shopkeeper's Charm<br />
Kill various mobs in arcstone - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=47370<br />
<br />
Aug - Runed Diamond (has Mana Preservation 6)<br />
Kill &amp; loot stuff in Steppes http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52701<br />
<br />
If you have have no clicky mana regen item then consider getting a Direwolf Totem of Spirit - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=51937 . This summed pet gives +6 mana regen<br />
<br />
Most of these quests will need a group but are fairly easy / quick to do (except Runed Diamond which may require a lot of killing to get required drops).<br />
<br />
<br />
Also head to the bazaar and look for cheap gear, if you check every so often you should see some nice bargins. Quick check on AB showed the following decent buys :-<br />
Arms - Direwrought Leather Sleeves 175mana/hp - 2k<br />
Waist - Sunderspring Belt 150 mana/hp - 2k<br />
<br />
<br />
As I mentioned before check out DoN merchants for missing Focus Effects (according to your Magelo you are missing all focus effects) and Master's Runeseeker / symbols (should be pretty cheap these days).<br />
<br />
<br />
As you are grouping in TSS zones you will be interested in Tenish's Leather Armor (Part 1) - http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3595. The arm molds can drop in the steppes and helm / bracers / gloves molds can drop in Sunderock so it's worth keeping an eye out for these (especially once you can hunt for power sources and upgrade any pieces you have). Spirit Mark armour from PoR will be easier to get but not as good http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3375.<br />
<br />
<br />
For charm slot buy a tainted heartstone (need to improve language skills to get it to max) or buy a charm from DoN merchant, do Wanderlust quest (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=52451) and then you can have both Adventurer's Stone &amp;  Wanderlust Guild Loadstone in the same charm.<br />
<br />
p.s. get Spell Casting Mastery AAs as soon as you can, will save a nice chunk of mana.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If you can pick up stone of expulsion for range would cover your magic dots and nukes where as your face just covers nukes....it would add nice chunk mana and hps too.<br />
 <br />
I would also get new ring to replace your jasper one. Lots of good upgrades mentioned and I can give you few more in game.<br />
 <br />
try to get the hot zone mana augs also.<br />

 <br />
Nice meeting you last night .....we picked up item at chef camp that we won't be using so I have http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=46450. Not huge upgeade on the shoulder but one none the less.<br />
 <br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=3492<br />
 <br />
Here is a quest to replace your ring which I think might be easier then Borzo from Relic until you can get your mana/hps up.....be careful these guys have nasty dots so stay max distance.....and keep celestial healing X potions in your potion belt to use if they do hit you.<br />
 <br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39690 the reward is nice and will last you a while.<br />
 <br />
I know you were having connection issues but if you could post whether you have TSS it would help alot too.<br />
 <br />
Talk soon,<br />
