<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">12-22-2005, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A Wizard friend of mine has been running logs with various focuses while testing his new Manaweave Spell (the Wizard version of Dawnstrike).<br />
<br />
Basically, what he has found is the following:<br />
<br />
No Fire of Dawn Proc:<br />
<br />
ActualDamage = (Base) + (Base*ActualFocus)/100<br />
<br />
Where ActualFocus = the effective percent of the focus effect your wearing.<br />
<br />
This is expanded with Fire of Dawn to be:<br />
<br />
ActualDamage = (Base) + (Base*ActualFocus)/100 + Songfocus <br />
<br />
Where Songfocus = Bard Song or Fire of Dawn Proc<br />
<br />
So for a critical (assuming DF3) with Fire of Dawn Running would be:<br />
<br />
 ActualDamage = (Base) + (Base*1.25) + (Base*ActualFocus)/100 + SongFocus<br />
<br />
Which *should* make the final max number as the following:<br />
<br />
ActualDamage = ((Base) + (Base*1.25) + (Base*ActualFocus)/100 + SongFocus * 1.30 (1.5 effect) OR 1.5 (2.0 Effect).<br />
<br />
We're looking for help testing the Last Statement, on where exactly the Druid Epic Click falls in to the order.  We believe it is placed last and is calucated off the final number.<br />

<br />
I have epic 1.5 (30%), 45% fire focus (40.5% on SS), max crit AAs (1.25%) and the Dawstrike nuke.<br />
<br />
My highest nuke has been 7894 but I was sure I would be able to get alot higher than that.<br />
<br />
2201 (Base) + 891 (Fire Focus) = 3092 +2201 (Dawn) = 5293 + 2751 (crit) = 8044 +660 (epic) = 8704<br />
<br />
However, I hear of 10k+ crits with foci not much better than my own.  I really would love an answer on this.<br />
<br />
As an aside, I cast epic on a SS after a Dawn proc and OFTEN get nukes in the 2700 pt range, the BASE spell is 2201, how can it be doubled and then multiplied by 1.3 and still get 2700?  This is after Ros has been applied and on the same mobs that were getting hit for full with my nukes for hours before and after.  I wonder if something is bugged with it.  (Yes, it was the good proc, not the bad one :)<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

<br />
From the sounds of it, you scored low on the RNG in reguards to your fire focus and epic effect, resulting in a mere 600 point increase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Philio</div><div class="date">01-06-2006, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I said doubled, I meant from the Dawn proc, not from a critical nuke, sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
I am still interested in seeing how our foci, dawn proc, epic and crits all interact.  I can't believe that no one has researched this more or at least has not posted their research.<br />
<br />
Do you have a link to the research your wizzie friend did, by chance?<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

<br />
and the Fire of Dawn proc is subjected to the same RNG as the Fire Focus and Epic Click.<br />
