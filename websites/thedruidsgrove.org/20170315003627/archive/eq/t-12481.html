While my druid is only 23 atm, my cleric is 54, and I was wanting to start working on my CoV faction for the skyshrine armor.  How can I check my faction and live(if I'm kos):moon: ?  And I have been killing in Skyfire for my cleric epic(I don't know if the wurms are on CoV).  If I am kos to CoV are there any quests I can do to raise my faction?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

if  you  want to check it , find a friendly tper  and go to cobalt scars, consider  any  drake/wywern from a safe distance.<br />
<br />
to get your faction  you can kill giants  in  great divide or kahel drakal ( up  faction thurgadin too ).<br />
<br />
<br />
the wurm  in skyfire are on ring of scale faction , not claw of veeshan by the way...<br />
<br />
happy hunting.</div></div><hr />

If you want to do any of the quests out of Veeshan's Peak you'll need ally and it's a pita to get, trust me. You hurt faction by killing the wurms in SF. You can check your RoS faction by conning Esorpa in WW. There's probably other places as well, but this is the one I know of.<br />
<br />
CoV faction is gained by killing in Kael. You can check your faction by conning the wyverns in Cobalt Scar. You can do this safely from the zone in area. You do NOT hurt your faction by killing wyverns in CS as long as you don't kill the named.</div></div><hr />

If you should find them up, you can also con Gore, Talendor, Sev, Faydedar, or anything actually in Veeshan's Peak.  Escorpa Roams near the Temple of Veeshan Entrance, Does not See Invis, Hits just under 300, and casts a AE Silance.  She also may gate.<br />
