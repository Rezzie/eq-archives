Money isn't really an option. My husband can buy me the gear...he just never ran a druid so he doesn't know what to look for specificly.<br />
 <br />
Also I know this isn't a gear/equipment question but I've reach the specialization level and want to know which spell skill to specialize in.<br />
 <br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Anything, that adds more wis and hp/mana at your lvl would be helpfull<br />
for the earslot something like http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12702<br />
 <br />
for fingers http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=35011<br />
 <br />
for hands http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=20088<br />
 <br />
just some sugestions<br />
 <br />
to answer the spezialisation question, it depends on your playstyle, if you feel as haeler take alteration, if you like to dot all the time take conjuration and if you like to nuke take evocation. all specialisations will rais to 50 but only one above, just make sure when you &quot;buy&quot; spezialisation to train your favorite one to 51</div></div><hr />

Here are a couple of suggestions that either do not have a level requirement or will last for a bit, items with an * are first choice:<br />
 <br />
Ear: Protection of Cabbage Quest for earrings: Earring of the Solstice and Xanthe's Earring of Nature - the items for this quest are usually sold in the bazaar and sometimes as the full set of items needed<br />
 <br />
Ring: Coral Ring*<br />
        Diamond Wedding Band*<br />
 <br />
Hands: Grey Flesh Gloves*<br />
          Cunning Gauntlets of the Kin<br />
 <br />
Feet: Golden Efreeti Boots*<br />
 <br />
Neck: Black Alloy Medallion *<br />
 <br />
Head: Othmir Fur Cap*<br />
         Nightshade Wreath<br />
         Savant's Cap<br />
 <br />
Legs: Stormreaper's Boned Leggins * (this is class/diety specific to Halfling druids - there is a whole line of this armor)<br />
         Brown Chitin Leggings<br />
         Bloodweave Pantaloons<br />
 <br />
Waist: Bone-clasped Girdle*<br />
          Runic Belt of Foresight<br />
          Girdle of Rapidity<br />
          Girdle of Mithaniel<br />
 <br />
Again, there is a whole line of halfling karana druid armor - not all of it is worth getting - but the legs and tunic might be something to look at.<br />
 <br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuppet</div><div class="date">01-31-2006, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you won't need to upgrade the chest slot for awhile.  the +WIS and +STA gives you good hp/mana at the moment.<br />
<br />
wait until at least 35 before getting a new tunic.  at 35, you can start to wear the expert's level armor (from DoN cultural).  then if you wish, you can start getting PoP armor, these have required level of 46 (something like dream haunt tunic).<br />
<br />
if you want to upgrade, try boiled leather cuirass.  if you really want to spend some cash, go with feran tunic 10-14K.</div></div><hr />
