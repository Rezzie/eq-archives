<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juniper</div><div class="date">10-27-2005, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking to ditch a couple of weak spots in my gear. What I have planned so far are:<br />
<br />
pants - Ikkinz1<br />
secondary - aegis of blackscales<br />
rings - glyphed prayer / ring of the silver dragon<br />
primary - epic 1.5 (though this will be a ways off, as technically I'm a 'dual main', and others in my guild need it more than I do)<br />
<br />
I'm stuck on my neck and face slots. Any suggestions would be appreciated for those or any other pieces.<br />
<br />
I don't have the AA to attempt Fear, or else that mask would be an obvious choice.<br />
<br />
My guild is Elemental, with Fennin down but no other gods. We can kill all the open field named in OoW except the angry bazu outside MPG and the Battlemaster in RCoD. We also are doing Ikkinz 1 and 2, but have not attempted 3. <br />
<br />
Magelo profile under 'Life' in signature.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">10-27-2005, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">waist - Gleaming Mesh Girdle (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=12510) from Fennin Ro. This has a must have focus.<br />
<br />
face - Mask of the Insightful (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9462) from Babnoxis in fire. Good mask to have if you farm fire.<br />
<br />
neck - there's only one from fire. Not sure if you're farming other planes and/or have access to PearthB...<br />
<br />
Necklace of Reflected Flames (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7767) - if you're looking for stats, drops off Magmaton... not the best neck imo since atk really doesnt help a druid much :P<br />
<br />
Entropy Pendant (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=16158) from Perfected Warder in earth. Detrimental mana pres isnt that bad :)<br />
<br />
these 2 are from PoEb<br />
<br />
Bands of Earthen Energy (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=16158) - from Gintolaken - detrimental haste, not bad.<br />
<br />
Twisted Twig Charm (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=8781) - from Awisano - cant go wrong with mana regen.<br />
<br />
But imo, when i was in elementals I had Pendant of the Triumphant Victor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=7768). Mana pres is hot... too bad you can get higher now with DoN augs np.<br />
<br />
You can also probably get one of the rings that drop form FRo event from the minis... i see you have a 60hp ring there hehe.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
DoN Merchants for a Neck Item, or Level 70 Progression mission #2, which results in a decent (pre patch is was sub time, not sure now) Neck item with (or at least did have) a Omens level Cold Focus.<br />
 <br />
There are several masks which result from doing various missions in DoD Spell Progression, 70#5 has ft 3 on it, and 68#5 I think is just a 120 (again pre patch) mana item.<br />
