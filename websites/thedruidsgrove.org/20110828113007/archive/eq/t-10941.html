I need money for runes, spell, and Ornate Molds, I have no clue where to farm stuff to sell.  I looked into Chardok, but didnt get down to B, got kinda confused and gave up.........is that good spot?<br />
 <br />
I am not looking for a quick fix like Giants in Rathe Mountains, or Gems to sell........just some gear that I might be able to sell in bazaar at night or give to my 53 paladin.  Im not interested in farming gear in OOW because im on Zek and PvP is a problem.  Any good places where I can farm stuff? Could I duo something that drops Ornate Molds in Sol Ro with a 66 Beastlord friend? Plz any ideas, :)</div></div><hr />

Also a chance at molds from all the mobs you kill (Sentrys &amp; Protectors).<br />
 <br />
Can be tough splitting them off from the sides, we usually have me pull and kite them around and let the Bst peel one off. Then I just continue to kite and do run-by heals and nukes as needed.<br />
 <br />
I think it is quite a bit more fun than a WoS group at least :)<br />
 <br />
I don't have the best gear by any means. You shouldn't have any problems.</div></div><hr />

Im thinking of trying to solo a named in NC called Pixt Trent.  I saw a Druid with a little better gear then me do it, know any strats to take him down?  I think i can live through his summons by rooting and healing, but not sure where the DPS will come from.</div></div><hr />

At 66 you would need a full group for RCoD. Things are normally ok there, but on occassion you do get a roaming raid mob take you out. The PvP aspect is also a threat, but RCoD even when OOW was new was eeriely quiet. There are a few epic mobs here, and I dont know how that works on a PVP server but imagine a raid force turning up while your party hunted? Would they not come and fleece you?<br />
<br />
For gear, runes, augs and rare stuff to enhance the augs (slugworms etc, probably sell well), I would recommend Dranik Scar Hollows (Instanced zone).<br />
<br />
You need 3 to get an expedition, the person getting the expedition sets the level. There are 2 names to be found in each but when you zone in the PH's are up. Take a couple of friends, a slower and a tank, as the named will summon.<br />
There are 3 different instances, Murkglider Hive, Firepit and Watering Hole.<br />
Each have some good drops, mainly the rare, and the chance of 66-68 spells.<br />
Theres a regen neck (or earring) which may suit your Pally in Murkgliders, a FT3 shield in the Firepit, and a 2 regen ft2 ring in the watering hole. <br />
<br />
But thats if the person is 65-67.<br />
<br />
At 68 the locations of the named and some of the ph's change and so do the drops. Still only 66-68 runes drop but theres a quite nice Dru/Monk/Bsty wrist item in Murks and a very nice 1 h b for a Pally/Shd from the Firepit.<br />
<br />
There are various things you can do here to maximise what ever you need;<br />
<br />
3 People need to be in a group to get an expedition but they dont have to all<br />
stay in it, you can drop the number to just 1 or change the people in the expedition (type /dzhelp for all the commands)<br />
<br />
You can log your Pally on to get the expedition, then make someone else leader, remove your Pally add your Druid and farm for items for your Pally. No runes drop from instances under 65 though, but still some nice items for the under 60's.<br />
<br />
I would say instances are the way to go. If you are after some nice gear and no drop stuff and want a challenge try the sewer instances in GoD.</div></div><hr />

I got a WoS grp the other day with a few guildies and we killed about 5 named.  I got the drop on the Blade of Disruption which is perfect for my pally and a caster wrist item that is also attuneable, so im pretty happy with that.  I also duo'd a named in NC (a ukon packmaster) easily and won a lesser muramite rune.  I'm going to try to camp that named more in NC till i got all my 66-68 spells.  Thanks for all the feedback.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
yes. Unslowed the mobs in sol ro are really some of the harder mobs in PoP, but unlike most of tier 4, everything fully slows. It won't be very mana efficent (mobs spawn in 2s and are immune to chances in runspeed) but at least the mobs will be gimp once slow is on em. <br />

Well if you mean the 'Pixxt' mob..he's a cleric. I remember one time i tryed to take him out while i was passing by (I had 9k raid buffed hp 7k mana at the time) and i went OOM trying to kill him while he was healing himself. The only strat i can think of is not to try him =p. There are plenty of namers in NC, and to my knowledge this is the only one that heals himself. The packmaster spawns in the valley in back of him and is fairy easy...just load up your DS and spam heal yourself. The (dragorn) ridgerunner drunt down the road from that area is an easy fight as well, same deal as the packmaster. I haven't been to NC to solo for runes for ages, but with a self buffed ~6.5k hp and 7k mana I was able to solo the drunt and ridgerunner w/ using ~1/2 my mana pool.<br />
 <br />
Edit:  Reminder about sol ro = Everything has a HUGE agro range and sees invis.  Also, I find that the elementals (these are rootable / snareable) -- that surround the ent to sol ro chamber on the center of the 3rd floor -- have a higher drop rate for ornate.</div></div><hr />

Sell them if you need the cash, use them if you need the spell.<br />
<br />
Also another named pops there, can't remeber what name is but farm it too :P<br />
<br />
lots of nameds in BF too for drops that sell decently.</div></div><hr />
