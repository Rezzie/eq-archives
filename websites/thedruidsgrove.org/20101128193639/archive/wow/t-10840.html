I want to try cat form for faster kills, but I've got a whole bunch of cat abilities on my tool bar and I don't know what to use (and in what order).<br />
<br />
What do you recommend? :sumo:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurg</div><div class="date">07-15-2006, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dont forget about rake as well though it and rip do not scale with level (yet) Rake is a great way to rack up quick combo points. Usually (with talents mind you).<br />
<br />
My normal first round attack is usually (low hp/AC mobs, Clothies) <br />
Ravage<br />
Claw<br />
Rake<br />
Rake<br />
FB<br />
<br />
If i get an OOC proc i will shred (i dont have the talent to reduce shred though i am considering it) <br />
<br />
On Higher AC or mobs with Higher HPS<br />
Ravage<br />
Rake<br />
Rake<br />
Claw<br />
Rip (4point) depending on the mob i wil throw another in for the 5 point<br />
then alternate Rake and Claw to 5 for FB<br />
OOC gets Shred almost always unless i cannot get into position or i am soloing<br />
<br />
I am sure there are others who will disagree with me and that is fine this is just what works for me best right now :)<br />
<br />
*edit* I almost forgot i always punch Tiger's Fury  prior to both Ravage and FB the only exception to that is when i am doing PVP and i leave the Tiger's fury out of the pre-Ravage so that i dont alert my would-be victim that they are about to get destroyed /grin *edit*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">07-16-2006, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone else not wait to 5 for FB?  I usally go at less then 5, the scalling of damage really doesn't benefit from holding out... unless it's to bring down a runner from 15% to 0 without much chase or stop a healer.<br />
<br />
Just as a side note, I've only recently gotten any DPS meter... since I had to get CTraidtracker and hence the CTcore... I have the CT dps thing up... I can hit 200dps with bear swiping three or more mobs... which seems pretty good.  Cat form is usally running from 150-170.  This is vs. Twilight Culists in Silthius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurg</div><div class="date">07-16-2006, 01:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For FB yeah i usually wait for 5 unless the hps of the mob are starting to get down pretty low rip on the other hand i usually hit at 3 or 4 <br />
<br />
Also in the rumor mill due to the talent upgrades and rogue review Druids are also going to be happy as they are going to make Rake and FB scale with level now (i am not sure about rip as yet) One of my rogue buds hit me with that bit of good news and is going to provide me with a link to the Blue post with it there :)</div></div><hr />

I have read the supposid 1.12 patch notes and it states it will, but other than those notes, I have not seen any mention of it. <br />
<br />
Also, in those patch notes, it says Moonkin Aura will now add 3% spell dmg on top of 3% spell crit and Leader of the Pack will add 3% dmg on top of the 3% crit. Ive been wanting blizzard to buff our 31 point talents for a long time....</div></div><hr />

Those are a fake, do not post references to them here, it will only confuse people.<br />
<br />
The actaul PTR notes are up now though; here is the druid section:<br />
<br />
Druids <br />
<br />
Barkskin: The tooltip has been changed to 25% due to the haste effect change. <br />
Ferocious Bite: The Book of Ferocious Bite (Rank 5) now drops somewhere in the world. <br />
Furor: This talent now works correctly with Cat Form again. <br />
Improved Shred: The discounted cost for Shred will now be displayed correctly even when you are not in Cat Form. <br />
Rip: Lesser potency Rips will no longer overwrite greater potency ones. <br />
<br />
Note the change in barkskin, it may be a 25% slower casting now instead of 1 sec penalty.  Would make casting with barkskin faster since we don't have any 4 sec or greater casts.</div></div><hr />

They were a great start to the old trees but cmon.....Id like to see some damage addition along with the crit.<br />
<br />
Swiftmend is awesome so mainly the feral/balance talents need a buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wulfgor</div><div class="date">07-17-2006, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In BG's where fights tend to be fast, I go with a FB after 3 points on cloth.  I will put a rip on high armor targets after 4-5 points.  It really is fun to watch your damage tick away even while you move away from the target to strafe or leave combat to stealth, return for a ravage etc.  Cat druids are quite fast and can overwhelm a player who is not prepared.  Very fun.  <br />
<br />
There isn't really a single answer.  It depends on how many hit points are left, how many are in on the encounter and when you think you need to bolt.  I can do enough damage and then lay in on a 5 point rip and move away to watch the target die.  Quite fun indeed.  A druid can kite a warrior this way.  Get your rip on, move out to root, heal yourself, moonfire and then switch to cat and frenzy some more dmg.</div></div><hr />
