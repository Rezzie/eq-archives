Entangled roots indoors? or how about a Entangled root multiple targets with a cool down like Tranquility? Haven't used Cyclone yet, but it sounds cool and have heard the use of it to get away, but wonder if blizz would consider it?  Your take.  Any others talent you think could use a fix? I love my Druid (Moonkin). Been a Feral Tank/DPS and a Healer talent build. Think I see plenty of love for us druids from the TBC expansion from blizz.</div></div><hr />

Cycloe is teh suck. :(</div></div><hr />

For example RFK is full of roots yet you can't use roots in there. Multiple targets would indeed be overpowered even with a huge cooldown.<br />
<br />
Like Big9er said, Cyclone isn't all that it was cracked up to be.<br />
<br />
I still wished they would add some AoE Moonfire like the ones the Druids in AV have. It would be sooooooooo coool and overpowered spamming it =D</div></div><hr />

Why would this be overpowered while mages Frost Nova is not?</div></div><hr />

Mages, are glass cannons that really cannot take too much punishment.  I could see adding a &quot;slowing&quot; effect to hurricane perhaps, but allowing druids to essentially CC multiple mobs for 12 seconds at a time and have the ability to heal yourself and turn into a tank with as much or more armor than a warrior would leave us beyond over powered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apep</div><div class="date">02-14-2007, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well for starters noone said 12 sec for duration, 2nd mages dish out 10k damage in 5 sec, thats how they survive while we survive by dealing the damage over some more time and being able to withstand it. 3rd, cooldown, with a 10 min cooldown i hardly see it as being a &quot;going in and owning everyone ability&quot;. Just a tool for escaping when you get battered by 4+ mobs/players once per 10 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blueboy</div><div class="date">02-14-2007, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rather see us root indoors than a group of mobs. I totally agree we can take a bunch of hammering in both our bear and moonkin form. I have used my boys, treants, countless times to escape as well as tank on a mob from a bad pull. (reminds me, need to fertilize those guys. LOL)  <br />
<br />
How about root multiple on retreat only? Say in a bad pull, only castable with target selected and behind us, and it disable all spells on us for about 1 min.<br />
<br />
Maybe that is too much too?. LOL..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now they do not work any more. You cast the spell, you hear the sound but no roots appear and the mob is not rooted.<br />
<br />
Seems blueboy is prophetic ^^</div></div><hr />

Boy, that was annoying last night. I gave up soloing and spent the night dodging L70 elites in Shadowmoon Valley looking for the altar to make shadowcloth. Good times!</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw, hadn't the old 20(31?) balance talent hurricane a slowing effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fahrana</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, logically there shouldn't be possible to use Entangle Roots indoors, since there is roots coming up from the ground...<br />
Anyways, i think there have come a new spell called cyclone or something that are useable indoors :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing druid players usually are more thinking people than other class-players.. a multiple CC (or rooting people indoors) would be OP given the potential artillery we have, just as Big9 said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Staven</div><div class="date">03-10-2007, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imagine an area effect that means all people are rooted in that 10/15 yard radius, obviously a telent (possibly an upgrade of NG) <br />
Imagine the potential in BGs :)<br />
On a more practical note, I think indoors (e.g. caves) is good for roots but houses not so much<br />
