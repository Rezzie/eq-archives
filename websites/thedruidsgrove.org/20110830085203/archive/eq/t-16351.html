<br />
This has apparently been fixed (along with offensive procs and AAs) and should make SoF launch's patch.<br />
<br />
Essentially the bug was buffs/procs/whatever going through a casting sequence as if you were actually casting a spell, with the accompanying reset of the primary and secondary autoattack for non-hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
The fix was creating a slightly separate code path for these casting cases that bypasses the auto-attack timer reset. I made this change to defensive procs, offensive procs, skills and abilities (AAs).<br />
<br />
Two things.. one is I'm pretty sure I covered all the important cases, second is I don't see anything in the code to suggest the problem would be limited to 1H or 2H weapons; the timer reset is independent of what you are wielding.<br />
<br />
But I might have missed something. If any of you have access to beta, these changes will be on there in a day or so for you to test. (beta pushes are hard for me to predict unless I bug my already overworked boss http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/images/smilies/3b63d1616c5dfcf29f8a7a031aaa7cad.gif<br />
<br />
At the risk of being flooded... PM me any concerns you have once you have re-tested and parsed, which I know you are going to do anyway http://forums.station.sony.com/eq/images/smilies/3b63d1616c5dfcf29f8a7a031aaa7cad.gif<br />
<br />
To be perfectly honest I did not look in-depth at your parses, not that I wouldn't, its just not step #1. Step #1 is assume there is a problem and look at the code.. since a bug jumped out I didn't need to move on, but if you have some specific parses that can convince me the problem was related to 1H/2H wield I wouldn't mind seeing them, to make sure I didn't miss something else.<br />
