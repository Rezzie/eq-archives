    * Glyph of Nourish *new*  -- Your Nourish heals an additional 6% for each of your heal over time effects present on the target.<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
<br />
    * Living Seed: This talent now accounts for your ineffective healing, rather than effective.<br />
    * Improved Mark of the Wild: Now also increases all of your total attributes by 1/2%.<br />
    * New Talent: Improved Barkskin: Increases the damage reduction granted by your Barkskin spell by 5/10%, and increases your resistance to Dispel mechanics by an additional 30/60% while under the effect of Barkskin.<br />
    * Replenish: This talent is now re-named &quot;Revitalize&quot; and now also works with Wild Growth.<br />
    * Tree of Life: You can now use Nature's Grasp and Thorns while within this form.<br />
<br />
Improved Regrowth (Tier 6) renamed Nature's Bounty. Increases the critical effect chance of your Regrowth and Nourish spells by 5/10/15/20/25%. (Previously increased just Regrowth crit by 10/20/30/40/50%) <br />
Intensity (Tier 3) now allows 17/33/50% of mana regeneration to continue while casting. (Previously 10/20/30%)<br />
http://treebarkjacket.blogspot.com/2009/02/hello-nourish-its-so-nice-to-see-you.html<br />
<br />
So!  It looks like we might be swapping out the Regrowth glyph for the Nourish glyph.  Definitely want the Wild Growth glyph.<br />
<br />
Hmmm.... Nourish might become more useful now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
X2 the mana cost at casting, but you get back 50% of the mana cost when the spell bloom.<br />
<br />
Not so bad when you only casting livebloom for topping the HP of someone, but a real nerf when come the time to keep 3 application of livebloom on someone. The use of this spell is becoming a lot more tactique that before.<br />

Yep. Same for me. I outplay/outaggro/outreact our other tanks by far. But im ok with my OT duties, cause when im not OT i am top 3 in DD most of the time, which is a really nice feeling. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: If u have fast reaction, u wont be the tank which has the mob at the end. :cry: <br />
for example:<br />
Shade comes from invis in naxx. U are at him long before the other tank notices. Suddenly he sees it and &quot;oh my god, its an unexpected mob!!!!&quot; -&gt; TAUNT.... :banghead_</div></div><hr />

Lol, so true!<br />
<br />
But if you have uber agi stacked tanking gear you can out threat their taunt too!  (hehe)  Maul/Mangle crits are just sick.<br />

Now that I am +40% dodge and crit buffed, I am re-enchanting/gemming where appropriate into hit.  My threat/DPS is going through the roof!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">03-05-2009, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just saw this blue post from GC (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15443525520-major-change-to-lifebloom-please-explain.html) regarding LB changes...Remember our stated goals. In PvE the goal was to make rolling Lifeblooms on tanks more expensive. We didn't nerf the amount healed by the spell. Currently, rolling LBs + Rejuv on a tank can be as much healing as a priest or paladin who is just spamming all of their heals on the tank. That is a totally fine thing for a druid to be able to do. But currently the druid can do all of that on more than one tank AND also add in some raid healing. That is just too good. We're cool with rolling LBs on a tank and raid healing. We're cool rolling LBs on two tanks. But once you are rolling LBs on 2 (or 3!) tanks and have enough mana left over for a lot of other raid heals, then you are just too efficient a healer. I understand not all of you were able to do that. But many players were. If that bold stuff is true, then I can see why they are changing LB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">03-05-2009, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bold stuff is true.  I can easily keep rolling HOTs on two tanks and then toss a WG on the raid once and a while without OOMing for 5-7+ mins (with innervate used).  And, keep in mind, I am no where near the best Resto in the guild, in fact I am probably ~average on the server.  <br />
<br />
I never could get the timing right to keep full hots rolling on 3 tanks, but I guess I always try to keep LBx3, Rj, and Regrowth on the two tanks.  Which nerfs my rotation a bit.  I suppose LB+Rj could be maintained on three tanks pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

Lifebloom heals about 1200 every sec and Rejuv has about 500-700 HPS.<br />
What HPS does a Flash of light have? i supose somethink like 2.5k. And a holy light? 3k+?<br />
Direct heals are just more heal in a short time... and all difficult encounters are made like that... so dont tell me a druid is soooo efficient...<br />
Don't even wanna talk about the pala-glyphs. And now they patch CoH for 40% more heal???.... give me a break...<br />

<br />
I agree that on a single target it is probably not as strong, but the fact that a noobish Resto can easily maintain it on 2 targets while splash healing is where the large difference comes in.  1200+500 = 1700 PER TARGET.  So x2 you are looking 3400 HPS before you figure in splash heals &amp; Regrowth (which I think most resto's keep up on a MT target).  <br />
<br />
The other big thing you are missing is that a pally or priest simply can't maintain that heal stream indefinatley.  A druid can.  If I didn't splash heal while MT healing two targets, I would practically have indefinate mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ooh! Ooh! Can I bet that noobish Resto? I've run a grand total of 2 instances and 1 10-man Naxx raid as a tree. My gear is a mix of instance drops, AH gear and a couple of 10-man Naxx drops I looted for offspec.<br />
<br />
I can easily keep up 2 stacks of LB plus raid heal and never be worried about mana. On a single target I can keep 3 LB, RG and RJ up almost indefinitely.<br />
<br />
GC is right, mana regen is just too good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a 25-man pug, I, for the most part, expect to raid heal - unless otherwise directed.  In my experience, a Holy Priest usually insists on healing the MT...which I don't mind at all.  However, that doesn't stop me from throwing HoT's on the MT + OT as a natural courtesy.<br />
<br />
I heal 10-mans with another Druid and a Resto Shammy.  Together, we are a well-oiled machine that requires healing assignments only when learning a new boss.</div></div><hr />

@Magellan<br />
You should use regrowth over nourish for raid-healing.<br />
Especially in an AOE-heavy fight it is far superior than nourish.<br />
And with it's high crit-chance Nature's Grace will be proccing almost every cast!</div></div><hr />

Why on earth would you do that? Especially after 3.1.  It's too slow casting, they're nerfing the crit chance and increasing nourishes.

<br />
If in a 10man raid all ppl are pretty low, i would bet alot of money, that i bring them up faster with wildgroth+regrowth than any other combination.<br />
The crit-chance of nourish is pushed, but the health-per-mana of nourish sux. Espessialy if there are not other hots on the target.<br />
I don't know how it goes on the PTR, but nourish was always a mana-burner and with the upcoming changes in mana-regeneration it will be even worse i think.<br />
<br />
Slow casting?<br />
A spell &lt; 2sec isn't really a slow spell lol.<br />
And with it's high crit-chance (even after the nerf), nature's grace will proc quite often.<br />
So no... not really slow.<br />
<br />
WG and lifebloom are great raid-heals...<br />
WG yes.<br />
But if the situation is a heavy damage-one lifebloom wont save anyone from dying with it's little HoT running for 9 sec.</div></div><hr />

Nourish is a tank heal (after you get 2-3 hots on him).  Regrowth is nearly dead in 3.1 (used to put another HoT on the tank before you use Nourish).<br />

Here's a good write-up (http://restokin.com/?page_id=409) on 3.1 healing techniques.  NOTE:  the site tends to load very, very slowly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as i have mentioned elsewhere i 'may' and its a big may....consider doing some 5 man healing in heroics post having dual spec.<br />
<br />
now over the past year of doing all the hundreds of heroics i've done i've not really ever gone with a druid healer.<br />
<br />
now last nite we were online early...well early for the UK to have many people we knew online and ready to play.....so its LFG for a healer. 4 of us had been ready to run UK- heroic for 10-15 mins and were getting bored.<br />
<br />
suddenly into the group pops a Druid......<br />
<br />
now as i often do when running with a new person i immediately go out to windows and put this person into the wow-heroes site to check em out........<br />
<br />
hmmm thinks me.....mainly blues....not even both Earthgiving LW epic items....and a green cloak  !  plus he appeared to be a little lower on hp/mana - at around 14k for both ?<br />
<br />
however it was a breeze......he was 11/0/60 spec. he rarely seemed to go below 10k mana ! ever !<br />
<br />
is that cos he was amazing player ?<br />
<br />
is that cos druids are OP as resto ?<br />
<br />
is that cos the rest of us were so OP and needed no healing :wink: <br />
<br />
I'll do more looking at his stats and try to work out the sorta stats i would have for healing / spirit and mp5.<br />
<br />
i'm currently running in a 5 man with some buffs at around 1650 healing and damage.  for healing i know my mp5 and probably my spirit will be low.  <br />
<br />
but i'd need to buy some proper epic healing gear like both earthgiving and then check out what rings/neck/shoulers etc are around in the AH....some titanium items perhaps.<br />
<br />
the big problem i have with multi specs is what the heck i use my limited amount of heroic badges for ! i have 40 badges !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are very strong healers as a class right now, but the success may well have been a combination of all the factors you mentioned above.<br />
<br />
For comparison, the values in my .sig are armory values, totally unbuffed.  I was running Naxx25 the other night and out of curiosity looked at my raid-buffed stats: 2400SP, 1200+/500+ regen.  I didn't think to look at my health and mana but I suspect it was a couple thousand higher than shown below.</div></div><hr />

Except that Pallies get to tank heal since that is all they can do. :grin: <br />
<br />
It sounds like with the changes to Nourish and its Glyph, druids can be great single tank healers and still offer a bit of help to raid healing (or top off another tank).  I hope the LB nerf doesn't push public opinion of trees to being raid healers only.</div></div><hr />

Unless Y or Z are one of our Holy Pallies... :-)<br />
<br />
The only time I can think of that I'm consistently assigned to MT or OT heal only is Patchwerk.  But then again, everyone is.<br />

Personally, I like 5 mans.  But that probably has more to do with my play schedule or lack thereof than anything.</div></div><hr />

Know I'm supposed to whinge and whine that we got nerfed, but I actually really like the changes.  <br />
<br />
It feels a little more tactical in terms of healing choice with the mana return on Lifebloom, but my fat fingers certainly don't mind the mana return when I let a LB stack slip.<br />
<br />
I'm still settling into a rotation again but it feels a lot more involved than rolling two stacks of LBs+Rejuve, SM when necessary, chuck in regrowth, rinse and repeat chucking out the odd WG as needed safe in the knowledge that you'll never even run low on mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the weekend I ran H-CoS and the tank was upset at the group in the end. At first I blew this off but then about 30 mins later I decided to send him a tell and ask why he was so upset. He said the heals sucked (I was healing) and the DPS was too low, and the only reason he stayed up was his gear.....<br />
<br />
Ok yes the DPS kinda sucked.<br />
<br />
He went on to say that he felt &quot;on the verge of dying all the time&quot;. He never did die. I'd been keeping rejuv on him and blasting him with nourish (glyphed), using swift mend or regrowth in rare instances when he got below 50% as needed. (I've kinda shied away from LB since the nerf).<br />
<br />
I only saw him close to death once or twice during the run, and I never actually let him die so I fail to see his complaint. (Especially considering we still made the timed portion no problem). In this case was my tank a dud?<br />
<br />
He did have a valid gripe that I didn't respond quickly to group dmg, which was true, I didn't let any of them die either but I kept hesitating on wild growth or single target rejuvs as we always seemed fairly spread out.<br />
<br />
Should I really be stacking all my HoTs (rejuv, regrowth and LBx3) on tanks and using swiftmend/nourish less often? That was his big advice. Personally I think post 3.1 I'd go OOM too quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nellie</div><div class="date">05-05-2009, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Complaining about &quot;almost dying&quot; when he didn't in fact go down seems a bit churlish but from the opposite point of view I have run my share of instances where I've been the one thinking &quot;if it wasn't for my gear/l33t healing we'd be wiping all over the place&quot;.  Maybe it's a trust thing. I tend to take the MTs in our raids and I've certainly noticed that since 3.1 they'll run lower on health while I'm building up the HoTs than perhaps pre-patch, but maybe that's just me.<br />
<br />
I still use LBs on the tank, but I tend to stack to 3, let them expire and restack unless there's a lot of damage coming in when I'll just swallow the mana loss and hope for the best.<br />
<br />
My rotation, and I freely admit I'm still bedding in with 3.1 is to kick off with a rejuve, build up to 3 Lifeblooms, Apply a regrowth and top off with swiftmend and nourish. If damage is under control, let the LB stack expire for the the mana return, re apply as slowly as damage will allow keeping up rejuve, regrowth and swiftmending/nourishing as required. That 1000+ healing a second ticking away is just too much insurance to ignore imo and in very few instances is mana an issue although I do recognise that this looks to be very much more gear dependent post patch<br />
<br />
In terms of wild growth and group healing I apply it to whichever non tank is taking damage and patch up whoever it missed with a LB (taking small damage) or Rejuve then an LB or two  as necessary.</div></div><hr />

Having had a bit more a play with the healing over the past couple of week, looks like his advice is very much pre-3.1 technique to me.<br />
<br />
What you do with lifebloom is a lot more situational I'd say. I use it less during Trash encounters in favour of rejuve, maybe 1 lifebloom and topping up with Nourish/swiftmend/Wildgrowth (even unglyphed) than I used to.<br />
<br />
During boss fights I will apply rejuve then a 3 stack of LB, but I wont rush to put a 3 stack down, I'll weave Nourish/swiftmend between the lifeblooms and then make a decision whether to let the LB Bloom or refresh it, normally because the tank has too much health to waste the bloom on. but I don't religiously maintain a 3 stack from the start to the end of the fight as I would have done pre-patch.<br />
<br />
I'd definitely favour Nourish over Regrowth unless you want/need the added safetynet of another HoT ticking but RG is definitely a tank only HoT as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

Definitely agree with this as well. Maybe it's the change to the rotations/applications of heals, but between the two of us that normally heal most of Naxx, I'm not feeling that I'm coming close to use my full range of ability at the moment.  I have lost my automatic top slot on the healing charts to the priest for the most part, but I blame that on not really having any little heals in betwen the HoTs and Nourish so she'll top up the tanks while I'm waiting for enough health to be drained away to warrant letting LB Bloom or chucking down a nourish.  <br />
<br />
I'd rather be second on the healing charts than top of the overheals :)</div></div><hr />
