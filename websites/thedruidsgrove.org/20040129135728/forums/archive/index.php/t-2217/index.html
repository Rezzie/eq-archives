<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FyyrLuStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have you done the Tunare Warden quest, yet?<br />
<br />
That is a good one at that age.<br />
<br />
Results in a neck item with good stats, and mana free root.<br />
<br />
You have to be a Tunare Druid though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bindy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1254&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;Warden symbol of Tunare&lt;/a&gt;  (you need to do all 3 quests in order, the links to the first 2 are on that page :) )<br />
<br />
You havnt linked a magelo so not sure what kinda gear you have, so with a wild stab in the dark you could try doing these if you dont have better:  <br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2336&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;Testament of Vanear&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=2336&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;Paw of Opolla&lt;/a&gt;  (pretty cheap nowadays but more fun to quest it than buy it :)<br />
<br />
Also, at 35 you could start on the forages and the Cleansed spirit of Antonica for your epic :)<br />
<br />
Edit - as for xp, you could start quadding cougars in Iceclad (on gnome island), or wolves in GD.  You could also root n rot giants there.  This would also mean that you could start out on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/intro.htm&quot; target=&quot;_new&quot;&gt;Prayer Shawl&lt;/a&gt; quests :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Benadan Painmaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Okay, forgot to add, slightly twinked, don't have a magelo. I have mostly acrylia studded, some blood something or other, like 190ish wis unbuffed, extended affliction and mana preservation for focus, using a kinda crappy scimitar and shield just for the wis/mana and such, not good for anything else as i've been using 2hb for a while, so i practice 1hs sometimes to get it up....<br />
<br />
ALSO will quadding dorfs in bb lower faction with dorfs in kaladim or the gaurds?? and if so how do i fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Molilya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also a great quest you can do is the Coldain shawl and the ring quest.<br />
<br />
- Mol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all.  The faction this affects is only the other Dorf citizens to be found around Butcherblock.  Signus, Magnus, Glorin, Doran, Gann, Ganbar, Darm, Delin, Gibi, Alum, Dalbar, Lann and Den.  <br />
<br />
I'm rather amused I found this bit of paper that had all those names on there actually from when I was on my dorf adventures and wanted to make sure I got the right ones.  The little fisher guy near the water will give bad faction hits with Kaladim though, so avoid him if you don't want to get into all that.  <br />
<br />
Not really a quest, but you could perhaps gather parts for the Solstice Earrings already.  Trades definately come in handy if you ever want to do the Coldain Shawls anyways.<br />
