I have a 63 druid with only a handful of AA's. Where is a good direction to head from here? Am I looking to level up or focus on AA's? And what kind of gear am I looking for? Where should I go.. this game is so huge now. I have just downloaded the Secrets of Faydwer so i'm pretty much up to date. Any input is greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I would suggest getting most of the healing, DoT, and nuking aa's first. By healing aa's I mean convergence of spirits and spirit of the wood as well as the crits. It's not a bad idea to grab a few defensive aa's as you go. After those get innate and shared camo along with both tiers of entrap. When you get those you can start charm kiting and the aa's will fly. Mnemonic retention and planar power are good ones to have also.<br />
 <br />
Storm strike and nature's guardian are some fun aa's to have but aren't crucial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seem to remember the last place i was root/dotting frogs in PoS. Is that still a good place to go until 65ish? I'm looking to buzz up to 65 then split xp over to aa's and regular levels... maybe some ideas on where to go for what level range would help a lot</div></div><hr />

I suggest Blackfeather Roost and root/rot until the mobs become to trivial to warrant staying there. Get the aa camo and entrap at this point. Then you can try The Steppes. After that move to Icefall Glacier. Then finally Loping plains.<br />
 <br />
Having your aa camo and aa snare at the point you go to the Steppes will be priceless as you can really start charm kiting there. At 71 you can get the new charm that affects mobs up to level 73 and move to Icefall Glacier.<br />
 <br />
You can charm kite in the roost too, but without the aa's I mentioned it would be difficult. Having an insta-cast invis to break charm is invaluable.</div></div><hr />
