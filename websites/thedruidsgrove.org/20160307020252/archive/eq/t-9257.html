I think a guildmate bought it for him when we were at the last fan fair. Or not. I do know the guildmate bought one for himself, just can't recall if he bought one for Rahj, too since Rahj does smoke as well (I've been trying to make him quit! Kind of hard though given his GF smokes, too).<br />

There's even EQ Playing cards. I was offered a set, but declined. I have no real use for any EQ Playing cards.</div></div><hr />
