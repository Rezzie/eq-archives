So far i havent experimented with solo spots in DoDh yet. Spell guides are simple: Do the missions from Jarzarrad the Prophet (in Undershore), Kelliad (in Stoneroot) and Brovil (in Corathus Creep). They each have 5 missions you have to do in order to get your spells. Jarzarrad is for the 70 spell (dawnstrike - nuke), Kelliad is for the 68 spell Skin of the Reptile, and Brovil is for the lvl 69 spell Spore Spiral. Once you finish 5 missions from one of them, go to Brother Hidden Path in Undershore (right outside Jarzarrad's hut) and hail him. He will give you the spell.<br />
<br />
The missions are challenging (especially to casual players) so take that in consideration.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Are the missions group or solo-able?<br />
 <br />
And do you have to do the spells in order?<br />
 <br />
In other words first the nuke from Undershore, then the skin from Stoneroot, and finally the one from Corathus?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
All the missions given to you as tasks are group missions, none are solo-able. The first progression step for 69 isn't really a mission; you have to camp a drop and turn it in before the mission guy will talk to you. That step is easily soloable.<br />
 <br />
You can do the missions/spells in any order. Mix and match as you please, but you don't get a spell until you complete the entire set of 5 tasks for that spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alwind.Siafu</div><div class="date">09-26-2005, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the rundown for our LVL 68 spell. <br />
 <br />
Mission 1<br />
<br />
Kelliad tells you to go find Keldrak to be shown the gates of Xill. From kelliad, run west along the wall till you see Keldrak. hail him. then have all the group say &quot;I am ready&quot; to him. You then then ported to an instanced version of Stoneroot.<br />
<br />
from here, invis up, and run NW till you see lots of spiders.<br />
<br />
have one of the group members run up to the archway just past teh spdiers to trigger the first part of the mission. Then all you simply have to do is kill 25 spiders and loot 4 hearts. <br />
<br />
Once done, head back to Keldrak, hail him and follow the text to go back to orrigional stoneroot.<br />
<br />
Hand the 4 hearts into Kelliad. thats first mission done.<br />
<br />
Mission 2<br />
<br />
Same as the first one. Hail kelliad and follow the text. then run along the wall back to meldrak and say &quot;i am ready&quot; to be ported to the instanced zone again.<br />
<br />
once inside, invis up and head to the spiders again. kill 25 of them to spawn the named guy. <br />
<br />
the named guy spawns at the top of one of the towers in the courtyard. having only done this once not sure if its random or not. Spawned for us at top of one of the towers closest to the arch.<br />
<br />
Named is fairly easy, gets weaker as his hp goes down. you will know when he gets weaker, as the whole zone shakes. Hits ~2k and flurries.<br />
<br />
kill him, loot a book. head back to meldrak, go home. hand the book the kelliad. 2nd mission win.<br />
<br />
Mission 3<br />
<br />
As with first 2 mission, hail kelliad follow his text and head to meldrak. say &quot;i am ready&quot; and get ported to instanced zone.<br />
<br />
this one is longer, but still easy.<br />
<br />
from port in spot. start pulling the things in the water. you need to kill 10 of these. loot a piece of meat from one of them.<br />
<br />
NB - make the person who loots this item loot the items from the others too. makes hand ins simpler.<br />
<br />
after killing 10 of the water things. invis up and head back to the spiders. <br />
<br />
Now, for this mission you have to kill 25 &quot;a drachnid&quot; and loot 4 pieces of skin from them. You also have to kill 10 &quot;a diligent silkweaver&quot; and loot some silk from these.<br />
<br />
after completing these steps. fight your way to the big door at the back of the courtyard. Guarding the door is a red con spider. this spider starts off weak and get harder as his HP goes down (as with 2nd mission, he gets harder when the zone shakes).<br />
<br />
kill him, loot his item, head back to keldrak for port back to normal zone. then send the person that looted all the items to do the hand in.<br />
<br />
Mission 4<br />
<br />
yay, finally a new zone layout!.<br />
<br />
ok, to start this missiion, speak with kelliad, then have whole group run to keldrak. Hail him to update mission.The zone in for this mission is different. In the last mission where you killed the red con spdier in front of that door. you need to invis up and run and click on that door in the normal zone.<br />
<br />
once inside you are all spiders!!<br />
<br />
once all inside. invis up. head forward until you see &quot;overseer renok&quot; all group get nere him, he will start to move. follow him<br />
<br />
he will lead you to &quot;Commander Hithrav&quot; . once in this room, the commander will see through your disguise and change you back to your normal selves. them both him and the overseeer will attack you. kill them both.<br />
<br />
after both are dead, invis up, and head out of this room and left. Follow this path round untill you see an entrance to some water. if anyone has eye of zom, this part is 20 times easier. if not, send someone invis into the wter to see how far they can get. once in the water, swim forward and you come out into a big open bit of water with lots of swimming spiders. the switch you need to touch is at the back of this, its a big stone thing. this can be pressed by player or by using eye of zomm.<br />
<br />
once this has been rpessed, back back out of the water.. and the soor next to the pool will have opened.<br />
<br />
invis up and head into the water through this door. continue heading north till you reach dry land with some jail cells in it. inside one of the jail sells is a broken chest. click this chest to open the next door.<br />
<br />
after clicking the chest. head back into the water, and take the east path. follow this invis until you reach dry land.<br />
<br />
once on dry land, kill the spdiers in the room, and get your puller to pull the spiders from the right hand tunnel (left hand tunnel is currenty blocked)<br />
<br />
once this tunnel is clear, move in. you will see a big spider, plus 2 protectors.. standing in front of them is the npc that the mission is telling you to find. once you move forward you get an update, that npc dies. the big spider vanishes and you get charged by the 2 protectors.<br />
<br />
kill them, and loot the dagger from a chest.<br />
<br />
next head back to the room where you just fought all the spiders. make your group run around and press all teh big blue orbs in this room to activate the teleporter. all stand in this, get invis. and you will appear outside. run back to kelliad, hand him the dagger. 4th mission done.<br />
<br />
Mission 5<br />
<br />
this is the last mission!!<br />
<br />
ok, get the mission from kelliad. Then run to Keldrak again. say &quot;i am ready&quot;. you will get proted back to the teleporter where you just left from.<br />
<br />
once whole group here, send puller to pull the left hand tunnel. pull these one at a time. these mobs are toucher. they have high hp and higher dps.<br />
<br />
there is 7 of these &quot;a royal protector&quot; in total to kill. <br />
<br />
once you have cleared the tunnel. head in and left onto dry land. pull any remaining protectors to here.<br />
<br />
NB - named cannot be killed unless all protectors are dead<br />
<br />
once all 7 protectors are dead. send someone invis to stand in front of the price and get mission update.<br />
<br />
after you have the mission update, pull the prince to the place you just fought the protectors and kill him. he is easy.<br />
<br />
once he is dead, loot his head. head back to the teleporter. once all there, click one of the stone to activate it. invis up, and get zoned out. run back to Kelliad. hand in the head win.!<br />
<br />
Getting the Spell<br />
<br />
Once all 5 missions are completed. head back to the udnershore and run to the tent north of Ruins of Illsalin zone. here around the edge you will find an NPC &quot;Brother Hidden Path&quot; . hail him, and you will get your lvl 68 spell or disc.<br />
<br />
hope this information is usefull.<br />

 <br />
Except for the first 69 'task' which really is just a drop off trash spiders, you need 3 people in your group to get the tasks.  If I recall you can solo the following:<br />
 <br />
68 spell mission 1<br />
68 spell mission 2<br />
69 spell mission 2 (13% aa per kill, no summoning, no repop)</div></div><hr />

By 69:2 you mean lost notebook? That is soloable, yes. In hard one everything is RED.. <br />
 <br />
68:2 has a big boss at the end hitting for a LOT if I remember correctly. I suppose he summons too..? Other than that, the zone is replica of 68:1.<br />
 <br />
Another no summoning / no repop mission is Lost Gnomes from some gnome in CC.. but I think you need 6 to start it.</div></div><hr />
