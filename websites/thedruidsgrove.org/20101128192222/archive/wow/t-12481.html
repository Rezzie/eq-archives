<br />
New to WoW and to druids, have a gear question.  Specced resto/balance at 40.  Love to instance and to heal, but obviously must be able to solo to level from time to time.  Put 21 in balance for offense, rest is going into resto.<br />
<br />
I've got two sets of caster gear.  One that puts me at <br />
+111 healing<br />
+93 spell damage<br />
+11 crit rating<br />
2539 mana<br />
1452 hit points<br />
<br />
By switching out some pieces I can have a caster set that puts me at <br />
+41 healing<br />
+33 spell damage<br />
+14 crit rating<br />
3274 mana<br />
1673 hit points<br />
<br />
After digging deeper in the forums, I see that conventional wisdom was +heal/+dam&gt;stats prior to the last patch.  Is that still the conventional wisdom, and is there a break even calculation somewhere?  It seems counter-intuitive to me to reduce my mana pool and my hit points by such large amounts (22% and 13%), but I'm hoping that someone smarter than me has done the math to prove it one way or another.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
At 70 you'll need to focus on spell hit till you you have a certain % to avoid resists on boss fights, and then you focus on dmg.  Stam, int, etc are just to make sure you don't die or run out of mana too quickly.</div></div><hr />
