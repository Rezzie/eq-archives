This time I want to make a Tauren Druid and level Feral as opposed to my old Night Elf Druid that was Balance. <br />
<br />
Now before I do this I want to make sure I can still sell like a loaf of bread in the goblin auction house between factions. Is this still possible?</div></div><hr />

Starfire, yes I remember that caveat but I play 2 accounts so that shouldn't be a problem.</div></div><hr />

seems not, shame really. its a good place for druids. i have noticed with forums tho. when a class starts out folks look for places like this to get them started and teach them how to play/gear/spec etc. once they get to know there class they seem to drift away. i have done it myself with some of my other toons and only revisit this place and my hunters forum as i like the people there.<br />
