<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rayze</div><div class="date">03-17-2006, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i've had my trooper up for sale for about a week now, and I've had 2 people come out and see it - two more want to see it this weekend. <br />
<br />
The deal's tricky because I haven't found any of the trucks I'm looking to buy for sale (that I can afford)...so if I do sell it, i'm kinda w/o a vehicle lol - I originally put it up for sale because I found a truck in my price range that I dearly wanted to buy but yeah someone else dearly wanted it too so it was sold the next day :( <br />
<br />
Anyway, my rant is: after viewing tons of ads on craigslist.com (should check it out...it's addictive too) I've come to the conclusion that people want waaaaaay too much for their old ford 4x4 pickups. I mean a mid 70s model 4x4 in decent shape and they want $4500-6400 for it?! ****. I sold my badass ford that was souped up and lifted for less than $3k when I went back to school *kick myself in ass*<br />
<br />
Then on top of that, the people who came and saw my vehicle want me to come down like $700 when I'm already selling it for way less than I bought it for less than a year ago. WTF?! <br />
<br />
*steps down from soapbox*</div></div><hr />

i hope that answers yer question.</div></div><hr />

People will ALWAYS try and talk you down. Even if you was selling it for 20 bucks someone would offer you 10 for it. Get the kelly's blue book value on the truck, then mark it up afew hundred. In the end you'll get what the truck is worth.<br />
<br />
Just a question, why are you looking at a mid 70's pickup? Your paying top dollar because of the age. Which unless you plan rebuilting it, it wouldn't be a good investment.</div></div><hr />

It's more like a high school obsession. My buddy had one back in the day and ever since I saw him take that thing in mud bogs even 4x4s had a tough time in, I wanted one...so now i've had 4 lol<br />
<br />
I just like to get em mechanically beefed up...lift kit, tweak the motor, suspension, driveline, etc...basically, turn it into more of a gas hog than it already is ;)</div></div><hr />
