The reason I'm having trouble with it is because it won't let me do the quest, I was at level 16 I tried to do it, with no sucess well I figured I could do it later on.  Well so I thought.  It won't let me access the quest to where I can get my aquatic form :-( I have every form, Dire Bear, Regualr Bear, Cat, and Travel except that damn aquatic form and it's really bugging me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aquatic form can come in handy espeacially when u are soloing and need to run from enemy/mobs (if u are near water). And also for herbalist to gain easy access to stranglekelp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a level 16 druid and tried this quest last night - I ran out of time with the bauble and failed - so I abandoned it.  i went back to Darnassus and the druid trainer on the second level, no quest given there.  So I returned to Moonglade, no quest there either.  Finally went to the Remulos Shrine and no quest there either - anyone have any ideas what to do next?</div></div><hr />

As soon as it came up failed I deleted it from the quest log</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">01-11-2008, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to pick up the quest again from Dendrite Starblaze (http://thottbot.com/c11802). The NPC is at 56,30 in Moonglade (upstairs in the building).<br />
<br />
If you have abandoned the quest and you cannot get it again from this NPC, try going to the original quest giver. For Alliance that is Mathrengyl Bearwalker (http://thottbot.com/c4217) (34,8 in Darnassus), for Horde it is Turak Runetotem (http://thottbot.com/c3033) (76,28 in Thunder Bluff).<br />
<br />
If you cannot get the quest there either, there may be a bug and you have to write a GM ticket to get it resolved.<br />
<br />
Also a link to the quest on thottbot, maybe you find something in the comments there that helps: http://thottbot.com/q29</div></div><hr />

I literally logged out and went to bed, today i logged on and could restart the quest from Moonglade.</div></div><hr />

I am level 16 but when I accept the quest WOW freezes. I have tried logging on and off, abandoning the quest and re-accepting and restarting my computer. Nothing seems to help.<br />
Very frustrating</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">10-05-2008, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should contact a GM about that.</div></div><hr />
