<br />
For now I am working on getting the Arc rod and some formulas.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any suggestions or thoughts on how to maximize your sales? Is it better to just spam &quot;300 Enchanter looking for work&quot; or &quot;Free enchants, pst&quot; and after contact explain that the free enchants are the initial bracer enchants and then launch into a negotiation of what enchant they really want? <br />
<br />
Any thoughts on any mods?  The trade barker only broadcasts the chants you can make from the mats in your inventory?That does little good if your mats are in the bank or on an alt.<br />
<br />
I am thinking that getting all of the weapon enchants should be the first priority and then all of the strength and agility enchants next?<br />
<br />
Any other general tips or advice or specific formulas that you have had alot of success with?  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikerun</div><div class="date">08-21-2006, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also got 300 enchanting three weeks ago and from what I can tell, the best way to go is grinding for rep so you can buy the formulas. There are some you can already buy as a druid since you start of at higher rep with Cenarion Circle so if you go in Silithus, you can buy +15 FR to cloak. You can learn it at 300 but you'll need the Runed Arcanite Rod to do the enchant. The mats are very high cost but it's a great enchant to include because you can charge a nice fee to make it since they probably have a bit of cash if they have those mats. Keep in mind here that you need to try and recuparate the cost of the Runed Arcanite Rod. On my server, it cost me almost 150G in mats to do.<br />
<br />
For selling, I did a macro with the enchants that seem the most easy to sell and I spam it a couple of times whenever I'm in town. Fiery weapon is a &quot;twink&quot; favorite but the prices have gone through the roof lately with the mats now selling for almost 25G on the AH (Burning Blade server). +100 HP to chest is usually a good seller like alot of the +stam to bracer and boots. You can buy +9stam to bracers on AH if you are lucky to find it. I also sell alot of +agi to bracers and gloves for rogues and hunters.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do, when waiting for someone to go buy the mats at AH and come to you, keep in mind you have to adjust the fee according to how much time you spend waiting for them and if they just take to long, don't waste you time and look for other customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barbooha</div><div class="date">08-21-2006, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the good info.<br />
<br />
Once I get the arc rod, then what should I be doing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost Bear</div><div class="date">08-21-2006, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a mod I thought was really cool when dealing with an enchanter once.  I don't know the name of it, but it might suit you well with not only handling sells but also you can easily keep track of what people actually want.<br />
<br />
The way it worked was the customer types /w (your name) ebsearch stamina, intellect (whatever stat they wanted) or /w (your name) ebsearch bracer, etc. (which ever piece they wanted to enchant).<br />
<br />
Then the mod automatically responded with whatever enchants you could do for the input they gave you.<br />
<br />
I thought it was pretty cool, and it seems like it would make cut all the hassle out of dealing with the window shoppers that just want to see what's available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barbooha</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found the mod, its on curse, forget name but it's under the trade skills section.<br />
<br />
I keep searching for high level guides on enchanting for profit and they all seem to focus on getting to 300 and then say &quot;gratz on getting to 300...good luck!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of a good guide (not thott) with a list of all of the formulas and where/how to get them? It would also be nice to list the &quot;suggested&quot; order in which to get them or other peoples tips on the order in which to acquire the high end formulas.  <br />
<br />
Is Crusader/Unholy going to be worth the time and money?  Are there any high end formulas that are not worth the money or grinding to get them, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sikerun</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 09:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you want a quick guide/list as to how to get each formula you can have a look at http://bollwerk.fileburst.com/. The Enchanting.xls is great for that (the pdf doesn't work).<br />
<br />
For making money, I find that early in the morning is better for me since there's less high level enchanters with more to offer then me. On a good morning I'll do a few enchant make 10-20G and go grind or quest after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barbooha</div><div class="date">08-22-2006, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, that guide is exactly what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
I also like the tip of looking for work in the am where there is less competition.<br />
<br />
I was also thinking of grinding (or purchase from ah when reasonable) for the chants I personally need instead of focusing on grinding/buying the &quot;best/most $ generating&quot; chants. <br />
<br />
This way the grind or $ is first beneficial on my own equip and a new formula for my sales.<br />
<br />
Any other thoughts or tips from successful high end chanters?</div></div><hr />
