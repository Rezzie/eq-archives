<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sealody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am so sick and tired of farming greens.<br />
<br />
Is there any item, preferable useable in inventory or whatever slot that's instaclick agro for mobs?  Kinda like the wizard's staff of temperate flux?  <br />
<br />
Or even something that's near insta-click? .1sec? .5sec?  No charges.  I need to mass kill green mobs that don't agro when I run past them.  I need to actually swing at them for them to want to chase me.  Normally, it's not that big a deal, but I much perfer to AE 150-200 mobs at a time.  And swinging to agro them just ...stinks. hehe.<br />
<br />
I've asked a bard to help recently... He runs though camp playing his AE-whatever song and pulls beautifully.  But he's not around all the time.<br />
<br />
Sea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cant think of a thing...  all the ones that come to mind have casting times or charges.  Only one might be a staff of temperate flux.  It's wizzie only but castable from inventory.  It's also a quest and nodrop so I dont know anyone non-wizardly who's tried it hehe...<br />

&quot;Effect:  LowerElement (Any Slot/Can Equip, Casting Time: Instant)&quot;<br />
The &quot;Any Slot/Can Equip&quot; bit means it's usable from inventory only by races and classes listed.<br />
<br />
Compare Guise of the Deceiver (clickable from inventory by anyone) with Mask of Deception (clickable from inventory only by bards and rogues):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Meh...  well I cant think of anything else.  My bags full of oldstyle insta-click pumice stones got morphed into the new style casting-time ones a year or so ago, so I got no ideas!<br />
<br />
Could just go around casting ae snare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paldor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try the level 5 TAoE &quot;Invoke Lightning&quot;.<br />
<br />
Cast time 2.5 seconds, but can hit up to 4 targets close to each other.<br />
<br />
Or just 2-box a Bard =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sealody</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">2.5sec cast time is still way too long.  Even with greens, when you have 150 of them on you, they will interupt pretty frequently.<br />
<br />
At that, I may as well use Burst of Flame, only 1.5secs then.  I want to be running around hitting mobs.  With piles of them chasing you, I rather not stop, turn... so the game doesn't interupt your casting to agro another mob.  <br />
<br />
Oh well. Just something that's ultrafast casting would work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kbern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well a swing is instant pretty much.  <br />
<br />
Or just pull up boo boo, and sit in place and sick him on the greens.<br />
<br />
Not sure what exactly your looking for but that would be a quick lazy way to farm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Loralin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I ran into the same problem farming in Hollowshade trying to raise up smithing enough to do the Signet of the Arcane quest.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I never found a quick way to round up my one person AE pulls.  Tangling weeds was about the quickest way I found to tag mobs.<br />
<br />
I never rounded up up 150+ mobs per pull, more out of common curtosy to other farmers than anything else, usually my pulls were in the 30-40  mob range.<br />
<br />
Where are you trying to do one person AE?  It would be easier to make suggestions if we knew more specifics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oooh I know!  Get yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1727&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Bracer of Hammerfal&lt;/a&gt; !  It and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=1726&quot; target=&quot;top&quot;&gt;Shattering Hammers&lt;/a&gt; it summons are both druid usable.  Summon a couple stacks and start flinging em around, dont have to hit a mob to aggro it.<br />
<br />
Tia</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh!!<br />
Even better would be the Dusty Soriz Pouch from ssra.  It summons all/all fangs with 170 range and only 15 delay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>RetlawEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That pouch is a little bit harder to get than the bracer, hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hehe, true...and if any monk saw you loot the pouch...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>willain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Another vote for tangling weeds, if you have it in your book.  Wears off quickly too, which is a bonus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ClaeophaRah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tangling Weeds is once again druid-scribable, FYI.<br />
<br />
I grabbed it over the weekend, since I missed it the first time around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hollowshade. hehe.  I farm late hours, early morning and there's rarely anyone else in the zone during that time.<br />
<br />
I basically AE all 4 islands and the main south land.  That's well over 150 mobs.  Pulling and looting takes longer then the actual 'farming' part.<br />
<br />
When able, I ask a bard friend to come and help, he easily pulls every mob to me.  Very easy AE.<br />
<br />
Here's a tip if you decide to do that... /hidecorpse all. =)<br />
<br />
If you dont, lag is crazy after the mobs die.  You can still click and loot them all, they all in a nice pile anyways.  If you don't, 9 outta 10 times, corpses will rot as you will not be able to loot the ones in the bottom before the corpse timer runs out.<br />
<br />
Well, guess it'll take another week or 2 for smithing.  Another 14 smithing points this morning.<br />
<br />
Sea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sitting next to a KOS greenie will usually pull them.  Just make sure Bladecoat isn't up or you're liable to kill things before you can actually damage them.</div></div><hr />

HAHA I had that problem yesterday. Went to HM for the first time to 'scope out' the territory.  Think I got a hand cramp looting :) <br />
<br />
Bracer of Hammerfall looks fun, how does a druid use that item? Is it throwing skill? Or anyone can throw we just can't get skill ups?<br />
<br />
Thanks!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">We can throw them, we're just considered to have a skill of 0 in throwing so we generally don't do any damage. :)   Although, if the mob is green enough, maybe the offense skill alone would be enough...<br />
<br />
Yay for shattering hammer duels between casters!</div></div><hr />
