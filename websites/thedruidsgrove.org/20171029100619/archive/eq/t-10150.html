<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Minadin</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm looking for information on FoMM (the 4/8/12 GoD AA) and Destructive Fury. Namely, what sort of % increase do we get from the 24 AA's spent on FoMM? What is the damage % increase per level for DF? <br />
 <br />
I'm currently working on my 3rd level of FoMM and I want to know how much I'm allowed to complain about the cost / benefit. It's required for DF, and most of the info I can find on it seems to indicate it gives somewhere between 1.5 and 3% additional chance to crit. However, it's all really old info, and I seem to recall something being fixed in this regard; I just can't find anything to back up that recollection.<br />
 <br />
I was just curious on the DF % since I hadn't heard anything about that at all, and would like to not be suprised when it turns out to be like a 1/2/3 % increase in crits or work about as well as our epic click.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance for any information you all have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for DF, the increase to the crit size seems to be 7%/15%/25%.  The description says nothing about increasing the frequency.<br />
<br />
Maxxed out DF, with maxxed crits, prolly looking at somewhere around an overall 2-3% increase in DPS (just for DF.)  Given the streakiness of such things, however, it will seem very useful at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">11-05-2004, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, Destructive Fury 3 increases the critical multiplier by 24%; i.e., with a 45% damage focus, the critical is multiplied by 2.7 max instead of 2.45 max, for a 10% damage increase.  Since the chance of a critical is less than 20% with all other skills maxed, this works out to around a 2% overall DPS increase.<br />
<br />
The tests I've seen on FoMM (one is linked in the sticky above) place it at a 2-4% increase in criticals.  Therefore, without Destructive Fury, it is a 2-4% increase in DPS, and with Destructive Fury, it's a fraction of a % greater.  I certainly can't casually notice it working.<br />
<br />
Both skills are only minor DPS boosts, but make for nice eye candy.  If you really want to boost your burst DPS with nukes, get Quick Damage first for a solid 10% boost, then work on FoMM and Destructive Fury for the extra edge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilwean</div><div class="date">11-06-2004, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DF1: 1.07<br />
DF2: 1.15<br />
DF3: 1.25<br />
<br />
Assuming you have a 45% focus and DF3, the formula for a max crit would be:<br />
(base*1.45)+(base*1.25)</div></div><hr />

quick damage will increase your DPS sure and your mana consumption, FoMM will increase DPS slightly and be a slight mana saver ( since more dps ), DF is an even slighter mana saving since a minute dmg increase.<br />
<br />
i alternate quick damage with SCS levels :P so QD1 SCS1 QD2 SCS2, currently there since i wanna finish off FoMM3 and hopefully CA3 too one day.</div></div><hr />

<br />

 <br />
FoMM 3 will have *some* dps increase for you.  If 12 aa's are worth ~3-6? DPS increase to you then go for it.</div></div><hr />
