I kind of did this as on my shadowpriest.  I might go into an instance to heal and avoid questions about being holy or not.  I could heal fine but maybe others wouldn't agree before hand if they knew I was shadow.  (same applies for feral/balance versus restoration).<br />
<br />
I really could see people checking the website to see what spec someone is.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I really don't think it will be a problem.  If I got kicked from a group for spec or gear or whatever, I really wouldn't want to play with those people anyways.<br />
<br />
In a guild you normally share what spec and what gear you have as it is.</div></div><hr />
