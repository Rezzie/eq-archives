I immedietely took over tanking, although I died as well after about 30 seconds - I was in cat gear at the time, so considering that I think I did quite well..<br />
<br />
In the end thrall finished off the last 1% by himself.  =P<br />
<br />
If I was in bear gear I have no doubt I could tank him without any problems.<br />

Seems normal hits on me were 5500-6500, with the unusual cleave being at 7500.  For some reason rain of fire makes some melee act like idiots and run in front of the boss.<br />
<br />
You could tell who they were though, they were laying dead at my feet at the end of the fight!</div></div><hr />

 <br />
But yea, druid tanks do really well on him.  We have a druid tank him, and a couple warriors stand up at the top to tank the infernals.</div></div><hr />

He's not hugely hard. The toughest thing is surviving the silences, but equipping dodge trinkets (Moroes + Badge) and alternating them on silences seemed to work fine. I don't think he even hit that hard either; I remember that Mags hit harder.</div></div><hr />

That's from a couple weeks ago.  I tank him every week if I'm there, we just found it's way easier on the healers with a druid.  When I first started tanking him I had to try and time my cooldowns to use during silences, the badge of tenacity use and frenzied regen, just alternating them when my health would dip dangerously low, but that worked well I found.  Now I hardly ever  see my health dip below half, lol, but I think our healers have finally gotten the hang of hotting me up before the silences (that really helps a ton, make sure your healers are doing that).<br />
<br />
I can't even remember what gear set I last logged out in if you want the check my armory, but if you're curious and I'm in dps gear or something lemme know, I'll switch it up.  My gear isn't that spectacular either, your basic mix of just under the armor cap, and a mix between sta/agi stuff basically.  <br />
<br />
It's a real easy fight once you do it and your healers get used to the silences.  Though I killed Thrall once, it was pretty awesome.  &gt;.&gt;  Az was at like 3% too, everyone was real enthused about having to do the fight all over again cause of me being dumb and not positioning him correctly.  I r talented, rawr.  :D</div></div><hr />
