<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palamin</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">scars of velious just owned. so much stuff to do. course I was quading cougars for exp within the first few weeks of release. Velious was just so much fun. I like traveling around it. It was a fun exprience trying to find where our ports were. The constant trips across Kael to pickup teeth to be able to port to wakening lands. Then later go inside skyshrine to camp keys to cobalt scar for guildies as well as guardian armor for them as well.... hey we were true newbies back then.. and guardian armor was one step down from planar. Kunark was pretty fun.. Karnor's was ok lots of trains back then though. Sebilis was just awesome.... although I did hate having to key up guildies one by one. I think I did most of the keys for the server for players lol.. someone was always needing a seb key.<br />
<br />
Original Everquest I loved the karana's especially south karana had alot of fun there. Starting after running after Fabled Mobs to run around to all the old zones for kicks and just killing stuff might make another twink to just run around old zones. Would be nice if they revamped the loot tables allittle to bring players back into these zones, alot of players are just plain missing out on alot of fun in these zones.<br />
<br />
 I just hated Luclin could never really get into it. Was pretty much unplayable to me because of the hours I worked always had a patch or something when I could log on. I never really liked luclin mostly because there is little coherence to the lore and stuff... Basically, it is unfinished to this very day.<br />
<br />
Loy was kinda fun for about 5 minutes. If this expansion would have been released right after luclin or before luclin everyone would have been clamoring out of sebilis and into nadox. Nadox is alot of fun.<br />
<br />
Ldon some nice concepts were introduced, but overall this was not a very fun expansion. To repetitive but then again levels 51-60 were all about repetition. Gates.. I do not like.. mobs hit to darn hard and forces more class imbalances</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aaeamdar</div><div class="date">04-23-2004, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PoP, by far.  Though as of yet I have not experienced much in GoD.  The raids in PoP are top notch.  First expansion with real puzzels to solve (SoL had some, but not too much).  I also really like the flagging system and progression in PoP, and of course, PoP solidified the move to 3 day spawns, rather than 7.<br />
<br />
LDoN could have been a great expansion, as its raiding content is also really good, but for the inability to add people after the raid starts.  To me, that one thing kills the entire expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and the fact that the loot on ldon raids wasn't really worth the effort :)</div></div><hr />
