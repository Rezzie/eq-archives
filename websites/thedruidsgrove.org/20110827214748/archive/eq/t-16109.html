 <br />
With a dual core, do a search for an optimizer or get the runfirst program to fix the clocking issues it can cause.</div></div><hr />

There are 3 issues:<br />
<br />
Compatibilty mode:<br />
1) Open up windows explorer, navigate to your ..\Everquest folder. <br />
2) Find and right click EverQuest.exe, click properties, click the compatibility Tab.<br />
3) Place a Checkmark on the following but don't click OK yet:<br />
-Run this program under compatibility mode for Windows XP(Service Pack 2)<br />
-Disable Desktop composition<br />
-Run this program as administrator<br />
4) Click &quot;Show settings for all users&quot;, place the same Checkmarks as step 3, click OK<br />
5) Click OK the properties dialog opened in step 2 and waited on in step 3<br />
6) Repeat steps 2 thru 5 for eqgame.exe<br />
<br />
You will also have to get Directx9 reinstalled as Vista comes with the upgraded Directx10.  You need to download the June 2007<br />
DirectX redistributable at http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/...&amp;displaylang=en<br />
<br />
Dual Core issue:<br />
EQ doesnt play well with dual core AMD chips. I assume multicore Intel chips have the same problem but don't know that for sure. Symptoms for me were flakey graphics like turning left or right extremely rapidly or moving forward in almost a warping fashion.<br />
<br />
The quick fix is to set affinity for eqgame.exe to a single processor in Task Manager, but you have to do that every time you restart EQ. The better way is to download and install the Dual Core Optimizer from AMD website.<br />
<br />
www.amd.com  - DualCoreOptimizerSetup.exe</div></div><hr />
