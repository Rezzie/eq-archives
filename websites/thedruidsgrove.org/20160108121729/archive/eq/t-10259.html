E'ci Frosty Breath - 250 mana / -55CR / -25AC<br />
<br />
Galcier Breath - 312 mana / -55CR / -30AC<br />
<br />
You're using 72 more mana to debuff extra AC, which does nothing to benefit a tables group.  5AC isn't worth 72 additional mana anyway.  Glacier Breath is still absolute garbage.  <br />

I use HoR to debuff in exp groups in order to help nukes to land.  In exp groups, AC/ATK buffs don't mean jack when a mob lasts less than 30 seconds.  However, it does help for te casters to get the job done faster.</div></div><hr />

In that case I usually split up hand / Immo duties<br />
 <br />
In upper rifts, I only try E`ci once or twice -- the resist rate of it truly sucks.  Only time it's worth going through the trouble (on every mob) is if there's another druid or a wizzy in the group.  Otherwide can you can stick to MR DoTs / rains for the most part.</div></div><hr />

GB is also also have a 31 ac debuff.  I'm sure that raises average dps of melees by 1-2, which will raid total raid dps by ~40.  When you consider how long the spell duration is, it makes for some extremely nice average damage per cast.</div></div><hr />

If I am MH I debuff incoming so I am ready to heal when the mob hits camp.<br />
 <br />
In a raid, I debuff everything that doesn't die in seconds with HoR, and use HoR and Sun's Corona on Named.</div></div><hr />
