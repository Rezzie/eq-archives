I remember having the xp one on my druid and then it asked me if I wanted to put it on another character and I clicked yes thinking that i'd have a different reward on that character.  Then I realized that ALL rewards went to that character.  <br />
 <br />
I guess ill try the petition but you know how well that works.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Something like that...<br />
 <br />
I know for sure I have all vet rewards on at least 2 of my chars!<br />
(the 2 chars are on the same account)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rugrin</div><div class="date">11-29-2006, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, if I already have a character with both veteran AA's from the two years I've been getting awards, then I should be able to get the same two awards on another character?  Then at three years I should be able to put all three awards on a third character as well?<br />
 <br />
If this is so, where do I go to get this fixed.  I remember that I had my first year award on my Druid and then for some reason I lost it, then later had the option to get two vets AA's so i took them on my bard.</div></div><hr />

I have 4 years, and couldn't add my vet aa's to a 4th toon.  I petitioned, the response was that somehow I'd claimed them on my main toon twice, and they fixed it.</div></div><hr />
