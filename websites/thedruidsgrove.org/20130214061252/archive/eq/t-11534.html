Is it true that they are instant cast and there is NO recast time for the 40hp/20mana conversion?<br />
If this is the case, doesnt that allow a Druid of all levels to hunt non-stop if they 2-box with a cleric? If figure the Druid can run out of mana, have cleric camped at west commons druid ring, port there, complete heal...then gate back to hunting grounds?<br />
Did they nerf that (besides the fact it no longer drops) or can a Manastone make soloing almost non-stop. Can ALL levels use a Manastone?<br />
Basically....is it really worth 1 Million plat? That must be the most expensive item ever sold.</div></div><hr />

PoK is considered an old world zone and with all the various zones connecting to it that makes a manastone that much better. if you can bind in a hunting zone or close to one and cast PoK gate you can be full mana in a matter of minutes. its not nonstop killing as you have to gate back and forth to refill your mana, but you should be able to clear out several zones almost nonstop. you wouldnt have to box a cleric but it would help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once you get to PoTime or so you will find you don't buy much anymore. Tradeskill items maybe and the like but you find you have soo much plat you really can't spend it (unless you waste monies on AoN and manastones, lol). And yes some people buy plat for RL monies, which is stupid just for the reason above. If your gonna buy for RL monies buy a character that is at Time level or above and you are good to go. You can farm plat faster than you can farm most anything else at that level. <br />
<br />
I may get one someday but not paying 1 mill plat, lol.</div></div><hr />

I have a Beastlord cast Perfection of Spirit on me in the guild hall. Thats 110 mana per tick on top of all buffs while sitting in the healing pool in the guild hall. You can chain cast imbue spells forever as PoS doesn't run out as long as you remain in the guild hall.</div></div><hr />

The only practical level 70 XP zone where the spell works is Unrest, and you can bet it will be nerfed, just as the Hole was.  It's still a useful item to have if you happen to be in an old world zone, but you will hardly ever use it today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Skeleton for is very hard to target or, used to be atleast.  For this reason it's highly prized by people who do alot of PvP.<br />
<br />
Skeleton for looks pretty cool and, it's fun to see a Skeleton weilding a Naturewalker's Scimitar.</div></div><hr />

PvP is a good option yes but not the main one. The main reason people want it is if in skelly form you can have old models up and still sit a horse. You can't normally otherwise sit a horse with old models up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i rarely use it, but when i do i'm really glad to have it, its a nice tool, either to use or lend out.<br />
<br />
worth 1m pp?<br />
<br />
yes and no....<br />
<br />
i'm a strong beleiver that useful clickies are very good things to have as they rarely if ever get 'outdated' and its like a perm upgrade to your character.<br />
<br />
however its not the type of upgradet the same type of an upgrade as a gear upgrade.....<br />
<br />
if you can still buy gear upgrades (whether direct or throug don points) [buying crystals] then no, not worth a ton of PP...<br />
<br />
if your at a point where you have nothing else to spend pp on?<br />
<br />
dunno still, but its a lot closer to being worth it then :P<br />
<br />
depends on server too.</div></div><hr />

In the case of the green flower, 50 poison resist that stacks with everything.<br />
<br />
I still have 3/4 thrones to get my MR flower (better than any MR buff we can cast, and manafree), but I don't think there's any red thrones left in existence on my server. (otherwise I'd trade a set of 4 crowns and a metric buttload of platinum for it)  I wish i could get the red throne I used in my Twisted Nature BP back :/<br />
<br />
Also, AoN (and guise) are visible status indicators, since anyone can dye their armor, and there's only 4 armor graphics (robe, leather, chain, plate).  Nothing says &quot;I'm better than you.&quot; like spamming skeleton form, or being a nearly permanent dark elf druid (on a side note, ironically, the only faction in kelethin I'm kos to in dark elf is the druids... which I land in front of every time I use the &quot;go home&quot; button, and then immediately go dark elf and get attacked because I forget that I'm kos)</div></div><hr />

In fact, I would not sell either for any amount of plat.  I enjoy and get too much fun out of their use.  Plat is virtually worthless to me.  It is worthless to my druid.  I only find any use for it in twinking out my lower level shadow knight who is wearing approximately 500k in gear.<br />
<br />
Someone above compared a manastone to a character upgrade and while I had not thought of it in those terms before, I completely agree with his/her viewpoint.  I find my manastnoe to be invaluable and if I did not have one, I would buy one.</div></div><hr />
