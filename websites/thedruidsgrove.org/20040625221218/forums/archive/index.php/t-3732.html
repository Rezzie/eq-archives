<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stormhaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Class spell/AA concerns:  (Many of which were already mentioned here (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovespells.showMessage?topicID=3308.topic).)<br />
&lt;li&gt;Request for Casting Subtlety type skill<br />
&lt;li&gt;Request for Healing Gift to work with all heal spells<br />
&lt;li&gt;Reduce reuse timer on SotW from 22 to 5-10min<br />
&lt;li&gt;Increase resist modifier on E'ci's Frosty Breath<br />
&lt;li&gt;Reevaluate Harmony - best lull spell is now the worst<br />
&lt;li&gt;Allow Protection of the (whatever) stack with Aego/Virtue<br />
&lt;li&gt;Lower the mana cost of Karana's Renewal (500)<br />
&lt;li&gt;Summon companion to work with DC creatures<br />
&lt;li&gt;Remove outdoor only restrictions from spells <br />
&lt;li&gt;Increase druid charm level limit from 60 to 65 (possibly as an AA skill)<br />
&lt;li&gt;Change natureskin line of spells into &quot;symbol&quot; type lines, protection of the (whatever) into aego line (ie: they stack) instead of allowing aego and PotX to stack.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Improve the Attack debuffs so that debuffing attack actually creates a noticable reduction in dps.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Add more dire-charmable creatures - not just at entrances of zones.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Improve/change Wrath of the Wild (Wrath of Booboo? - swarm of bearpets) <br />
&lt;li&gt;Reduce time on Natures Recovery to 60-90 seconds (currently 180 seconds), and reduce recast time to 45 seconds (currently 90 seconds). &lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
New ability ideas:<br />
&lt;li&gt;Animal-only slow<br />
&lt;li&gt;AC buff vs animals only<br />
&lt;li&gt;NPC damage mitigation spell (limit amount of damage outputted by a creature).  Does not stack with slow spells.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Attack debuff with significant reduction in attack - stacks with slow spells.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Percentage based damage shields - instead of a set number, damage shield which returns a percentage of what a creature hits you for.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Increase crit melee hits (short duration).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Increase crit spells (short duration).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Damage bonus for melee (short duration).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Extremely short duration mob slow spell.<br />
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Fork&quot; AA skill - % based activation (like crits) - on a successful activation, the spell acts as if two of the same spell were cast with no additional aggro, just double damage.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Animal only heal over time<br />
&lt;li&gt;90% rez<br />
&lt;li&gt;61-65 level group wolfform or group Mask of the (whatever).  Adds to attack, still gives ultravision, some mana/hp regen (+2-3).  No &quot;wolf bobblehead motion&quot; if possible.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Spell which allows for weapons to proc a DD<br />
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Nature's Focus&quot; AA:2/4/6, When activated, adds 100/125/150% to the damage of the next DD cast, at a cost of 200% mana. Displayed as a critical blast. Prerequisite: rank 3 Spell Casting Fury. Reuse 4 or 5 minutes.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Pet buff for summoned pet which makes the pet stronger depending on the number of people in the group.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Translocate spells (single target version specifically mentioned)<br />
&lt;li&gt;AA skill which allows specialization in a secondary skill<br />
&lt;li&gt;Random %chance of converting melee dmg received into healing at a fixed rate, say a 50% return (ie say 10% chance, it will be streaky but overall would act as a dmg output reduction of 10% on mobs with say 5% becoming healing - a 50% return rate)<br />
&lt;li&gt;Random %chance of converting spell/spell-like (ie breath) effects into healing, say at a 50% return (as above perhaps 10% chance, so 1x out of 10 that 1000hp aoe might be a 500hp heal).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Random %chance of converting melee dmg received into MANA at a fixed rate, say 50% return. (ie a melee hit for 300 has a 10% chance of being converted into 150 mana).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Random %chance of converting spell/spell-like (ie breath) effects into healing, say at a 25% return (as above perhaps 10% chance, so 1x out of 10 that 1000hp aoe might become 250 mana. Remember this nets down to 25% of 10%, so 2.5% mana return on spell dmg over time. Shouldn't be too nutty).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Buffs to increase Damage Mitigation and Damage Avoidance would be nice. Maybe this would mean just adding an AC component to a spell like Nature's Recovery, but possibly a new line of defense ability increasing buffs along the lines of Combat Stability and Combat Agility.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Re-evaluate the effectiveness of Enhanced/Viscid roots. Making them more reliable could give druids a useful role in groups. <br />
&lt;li&gt;A buff that increases the amount of damage, DD spells do by 10% (make the spell last 45 mins).<br />
&lt;li&gt;A buff that increases the amount of healing, healing spells do by 10% (make the spell last 45 mins).<br />
&lt;li&gt;A buff that increases the duration of buffs by 10% (make the spell last 45 mins).<br />
&lt;li&gt;Paladin 90% res + druid short duration enhancement casted on the paladin (30 seconds) -&gt; 96% res<br />
&lt;li&gt;Beastlord/Bard 50% slow + druid short duration enhancement casted on the Beastlord/Bard (30 seconds) -&gt; 60/70% slow<br />
&lt;li&gt;Natures' slow spell; outdoor only, a combination snare and slow; At level 65 a 50% slow<br />
&lt;li&gt;Elemental Line of Buffs. 4 Unique Buffs that you could only have one up on. Earth Buff: Percentage Increase in Damage Mitigation / Fire Buff: Attack Buff + up to 10% Nuking Buff / Air Buff: Increase Chance of Procs and Crits / Water Buff: Percentage Increase in Healing.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Some sort of aggro control&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
How do I get items added to this list?<br />
Go to this thread (http://pub149.ezboard.com/fthedruidsgrovegeneral.showMessage?topicID=31214.topic), make sure that the idea hasn't already been stated by someone else and voice your opinion/ideas.  The main discussion period should be considered closed at this point - most of the ideas brought up in the referenced thread became redundant around the 100th post.  If you feel that you have an idea which could help resolve the druid's grouping problems, please create a new thread and allow the community to add their commentary.  If the community feels that the item should be added to the list, this topic will be edited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Negative support (ideas with mostly or many negative comments):<br />
New Ability Ideas<br />
&lt;li&gt;Animal-only slow<br />
&lt;li&gt;AC buff vs animals only<br />
&lt;li&gt;Animal only heal over time<br />
&lt;li&gt;90% rez<br />
&lt;li&gt;Natures' slow spell; outdoor only, a combination snare and slow; At level 65 50% slow&lt;/li&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stormhaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&lt;li&gt;&quot;Animal-only&quot; anything - Very small population of creatures tagged as &quot;animal&quot; in the game.  Animal-only slow would help soloing druids, not necessarily add to group value.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Rez - There can be a five page essay written on this, but what it boils down to is the belief that the stranglehold on rez should be broken.  Either by removing the EE requirement from necros (to make the necro rez more accessible) or via a tradeskill-type item.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Slow spells - Slow spells to be worse than shaman or enchanter, to use in place of either class in case they are not available for a group.  Concern is that this will aid soloing more than grouping situations.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Charm spell increase - Another solo vs group debate.  The concern that increasing the charm level will aid soloers more than groupers.&lt;/li&gt;</div></div><hr />
