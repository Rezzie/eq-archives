I thought of crystal chitin but then I'd look like a paly (ick). I have a full suit of gnome skin but you can't really wear black to a wedding so I was wondering is there anything else out there that might be suitable. Chain maybe? I've never seen chain on a half elf. Would anyone have any pics to share? Or any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

This is me with Vermiculated (eww) and Elysian -- the chain look on a half elf. :)</div></div><hr />

Also, the elven chain has a slight greenish/blue tint to it, the tunare imbued version does for sure, the unimbued version might be different. (elven chainmail is the 'old' high elven cultural smithing)<br />

If you ask me though, the gnome skin looks excellent, even if it is black, especially when /dopropertinting works right (for me it makes everybody naked, hah).  everquest.allakhazam.com/...meskin.jpg (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/fashion2/luclin_halfelf_female_gnomeskin.jpg)<br />

Full nathsar would also look good, but it'd be quite hard to get the full suit.  everquest.allakhazam.com/...female.jpg (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/equipment/fashion2/half-elf-nathsar-female.jpg)<br />
<br />
I remember Blue Wicker armor from stonebrunt, but I haven't found any screenshots of it, and the only piece I had was the cap, but I think it was very close to the nathsar color, as an alternative if you can't get nathsar.</div></div><hr />
