It's up to your party mostly to try and make sure they're getting out of his &quot;RAWR-BOOM&quot; ability...(Dreadful Roar and Dark Smash I think they're called).<br />
<br />
I think both act as an interrupt, one of them has a spell-lock mechanic attached to it.  Really the only thing you can do in AoE damage fights is throw HoTs on everyone and top them off when you can (hopefully they have enough health to survive his AoE blasts to begin with).  It's similar to healing through the Lightning Nova on Loken.  Just try to keep Hots rolling on everyone and then top them off after (with regrowth or nourish, whichever you like more).</div></div><hr />

<br />
all ranged can position themselves near the columns so they can take shelter when his aoe is about to hit.<br />
<br />
that should mitigate a lot of the healers work tbh and allow you to really worry about the tank and melee. but i agree with destinae its up to your party to avoid his badness :)<br />
<br />
finally watch out for the whirling axe of his. caught me out a few times because i wasnt watching :)</div></div><hr />
