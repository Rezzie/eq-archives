Has just about everything: tankage, healage plus backup healage (which is something a lot of group combos are missing, i.e. if the cleric dies, who's gonna heal!), crowd control, plenty of porting+evacing, tons of dps, an auxiliary tank (mage pet) when needed and bkup &quot;rez&quot; (from druid, for when the cleric dies). Between the ports, the wizard's ability to punt the group to her bind and the power of the Call of the Hero spell, this group can move rapidly almost anywhere.<br />
<br />
Pretty close to ideal. What I miss is a shaman for the HP buff and some of the useful debuffs. I miss any kind of FD class for really tough splitting, although snare+CoHero is very close to being as effective. (Still, I wouldn't trade my warrior for an SK just cuz the latter can FD. For some encounters there is NO sub for a warrior.) Sometimes I lament the lack of a rogue for really tough scouting, although an Eye of Tallon is a half-decent poor man's substitute. A necro would be useful for backup rezzing, corpse summoning and mana regen, but with OOC regen today, mind wrack just ain't what it used to be.<br />
<br />
I really can't rationalize replacing any of the classes in my boxed set with any other class...<br />
<br />
The necro comes the closest.... I could get my group to some real tough spots if I had a necro to invul-run to the camp spot, FD and then summon corpse/rez the mage to bring in the rest of the group...</div></div><hr />

As far as duo/trio goes--<br />
<br />
It very hard to decide between beastlord/druid and warrior/druid... As a full time box, I'd prolly give warrior/druid a heads up.  Many people champion knight+druid, and while in many situations a knight is a easier to heal, the warrior dps usually compensates+than some, on top of being a far more boxing friendly class.<br />
<br />
For trio, I'd prolly say dru+beast+war.  Pre-push changes, I would have said you would have to be crazy to box a beast and another melee, but pet push isn't that bad now.</div></div><hr />

It makes no sense to construct any group without a cleric. Sure, a pally can rez, as well as a necro, but there is no substitute for cleric healing power, assuming you want a group that can actually handle challenging content.<br />

I don't see any reason to have a beastlord. Nothing against the class &quot;personally&quot; but they offer nothing that other classes can't match and add more. <br />

Beasts are actually pretty solid dps.<br />
<br />
As far as no cleric, well that's more just to fit a shaman into the group since they bring a lot to a group.  Having a shaman + druid + cleric in the same group is redundant.<br />
<br />
I'd just say avoid an enchanter at all costs, they bring very little to the group.  Have someone log one in for buffs or carry around potions.  There no group content where bard can't do an enchanter's job mez-wise.</div></div><hr />

An ideal group must have massive sustained DPS, and that means melee - the modern game (even including OOC regen) is just built that way.  Massive tankage means either a warrior or a top-top end SK or pally.  Cleric for the unbeatable heals, shammy to combine slows and melee DPS boosts, bard for unparalleled pulling, more melee DPS boosting, crowd control.  So, given we're talking about an &quot;ideal group&quot;, mine is a second vote for <br />

This is the group I've done most of my huntings the past 4-5 years and there aren't many events we cannot do. I know only couple of fights when warrior is needed, other than that we've blown through PoP, GoD, DoN, DoD and TSS together. This has worked so well because the paladin and rest of us have very good gear (we raid but not quite the end game), also making me able to be main healer for rough fights and we have replaced cleric with DPS. <br />
<br />
Then again, I've done stuff like TBS Thalassius missions with pure dps group: beastlord, berserker, rogue, ranger, druid and cleric. No one was tanking and no slows! Best AA exp I've ever gotten, we killed those mobs so fast they hardly had time to hit back :thumbup: Oh and I love Thalassius missions, I can use Annihilate Unnatural &lt;3</div></div><hr />

IMO Druids and Enchanters are the red headed step children when it comes to forming the &quot;ideal&quot; group. Neither class is really needed, the only reason druid appears so often is because this is a druid forum and the majority of posters play druids duh.</div></div><hr />

I just cannot agree with this. So many times people have been wanting me into group rather than cleric, because I bring also ports, FoE, buffs and tiny bit dps, exodus, debuffs. I often 2-box also my chanter, so I'm main healer+main CC and slower. And I do this in places in Ashengate. Usually people cheer when they see there is a chanter in group!</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as chanters, bard usually cancels out the need to have one.  But the tradeoff off isn't mez vs nothing, it's mez vs shaman.  Multi tanking w/ a shaman in slower spot usually works out fine.  I can pull/tank every TBS mission and AG w/ my warrior alt fine w/o mez.  While it may not be as mana efficient as mezzing, the extra benefits of a shaman outweight the extra med time for the cleric.  Not to count that the shaman can heal singles np while the cleric OOCs anyways.<br />

Ironic thing is, when I main heal thalissus TBS missions, I actually do more dps playing a cleric than I do playing a druid. Vow of valor + blightflame (weapon) + reproval (nuke) make for some decent dps.  Combine the low mana cost w/ efficient cleric heals its more sustainable than druid healing+dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPSing to that extent is only situational.  In any more difficult content, using VoValor is risky.<br />
<br />
But even in more difficult, a cleric can nuke nearly as well -while main healing- as druids.<br />
<br />
A cleric nuke is ~70% as potent as a druid nuke, but druid healing isn't 70% as potent as cleric healing.  This is why they have an edge in some situations.<br />
<br />
The factor that makes us pull ahead is dots, but dots are limited in number and not always practical in quick killing xp groups.</div></div><hr />

I usually play the druid + shaman, or the druid + necro.  The other 4 get boxed by my brother.  Never had a problem doing anything with this group, more than adequate healing with a druid + shaman + paladin, it's also probably made it relatively easy since all the characters have been in some of the best raid gear since we've played them together.<br />

Anyone that says druids can't healing challengeing content can suck it, I've main healed my way through AG factioning/xping, FC faction/xping, all TBS progression missions, old content, new content, you name it druids can heal it if you know what you're doing.</div></div><hr />

More true words are rarely spoken. Even though my druid has the mana-pool and focii to main heal pretty much any content I have tried, if I have an opportunity to box a cleric instead (for a group), I usually do so, because the difference is so drastic. <br />

When I just 2-box tho, I like druid more than cleric!</div></div><hr />

It matters not a whit that an endgame cleric can heal better than an endgame druid - when for all essential purposes both can do a perfectly fine job regardless.  People die when my druid is healing when someone messes up badly, and they die when I'm nuking and a cleric is healing...for precisely the same reason.  I did see a difference at half my current mana pool and with a handful of AAs.  It just goes away with 1000 AAs and decent midrange raid gear.</div></div><hr />
