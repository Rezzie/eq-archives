Been reading the forums for a while now but this is my first post. I am a 45 NE Druid on Kirin Tor and I have found the grind to be well...a &quot;grind&quot;. I am now getting sick of the endless maze of quests that reap little xp...and while I love to shred stuff, even rested xp is getting monotonous. I am spec'd 1/29/5 and plan on continuing in to spec heavy feral...most of the rest in balance. Have any of you gotten p@@#$ off at the slowness of 40-60 leveling? Is there something I can do to improvce my time. I have only been playing about 3 months but most of that was deciding mt toon (I have a rogue, hunter, paladin, priest all 19) I love the druid, but I can never get into instances where I know I will get better gear in order to boost my xp intake. BTW I have solo'd everything so far except a couple of times I PUG'd in SM.</div></div><hr />

I have a level 44 druid myself, and I am actually following a guide to make my leveling faster. Here's the link (http://www.wow-pro.com/node/599). Not sure if this is what you were looking for, but it sure speeds up my leveling time. 30 - 40 took less than  a week, playing in between mass amounts of homework. Hm, you did mention 40-60 being slow, and as I only just reached 44, I am not sure how fast the climb from here will be. But anyway, I figured I'd point you to that. Use it if you wish. I certainly love it.</div></div><hr />

No one will really know your spec, you'll see more interesting content and get chances at better gear.  Your other option is to spend some time on your realm forums looking for leveling guilds that could use a feral druid.  PuGs stink.</div></div><hr />
