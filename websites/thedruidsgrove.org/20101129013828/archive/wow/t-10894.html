Does anyone know of a good Paladin forum, similar to TDG that I can ask advice on stuff?  I have gotten tons of good info from The Priests Haven and The Warlock's Den.<br />

So far I put my first 31 points into Retribution and he just destroys things. Sure the dps is unreliable as you wait for SoC to proc but when it does and you combine it with a judgement then the ole hammer toss, wow, it can be incredable. Not to mention their survivability.<br />

  The only thing that keeps me from leveling him further is that I keep asking myself, do I want another character that the general population tends to push into the full time healer roll?</div></div><hr />
