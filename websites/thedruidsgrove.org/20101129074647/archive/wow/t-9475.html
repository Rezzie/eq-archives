<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noom_dk</div><div class="date">10-16-2005, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A friend of mine abandoned the Poinson quest not knowing that he would get the cure poison skill out of it...<br />
<br />
Now he would like to get the quest again but none of the NPC's will give it to him... he has deleted all the quest items and removed the quest from his quest log ofc... but he still can't get it...<br />
<br />
Anyone who have tried this or knows what he can do to get it?<br />
<br />
We have tried contacting a GM in-game but all he told us was to abandon the quest and talk to the NPC -_-<br />
<br />
Lame answer since we wrote in the ticket that we had tried that...<br />
<br />
Anyway hope someone can help :)</div></div><hr />

Not sure then, it's been a while since I've done it.  You might tell him to try opening a support petition in-game to have GM help with it.</div></div><hr />

I was going to go back to do it at some time but never got around to it.  At level 26 you get Abolish Poison which is an upgrade to the reward so I didn't bother going back.</div></div><hr />

If you can't collect it via herbalism, try to buy it.  I got mine from a friend because I went skinning/leatherworking rather than herbalism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they cost the same mana cost, its a percentage of your base mana i am pretty sure.</div></div><hr />

You should be able to pick up the start of the quest from the head druid in Thunderbluff ... he will send you to Moonglade ... then to the Crossroads (I think)</div></div><hr />

Do you have to do that quest so you can do the one for cat form  later or travel form?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeh, anyone who has the quest can pick them you just need to fight your way into the caves, for alliance its the same caves you went to for bear form, there are 2 to 3 mushrooms per cave,<br />
<br />
Earthroot is low level herbalism and can also be bought cheaply in the auction house</div></div><hr />

Sea form (at lvl 16) is last quest for a shapeshift.  You can buy cat form at lvl 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.  It is my understanding that it is the same mana cost, but the reason you would sometimes use cure poison over abolish poison is that abolish poison &quot;attempts&quot; to cure one poison effect (repeadedly for the specified amount of time).  Cure poison removes the one effect.  I've had abolish poison fail to remove a poison effect which sucks when you really need it gone.  Again, that's what I've been told about the two.</div></div><hr />
