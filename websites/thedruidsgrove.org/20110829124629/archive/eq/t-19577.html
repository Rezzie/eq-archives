But there are more tumble weeds in SoD than all of Antonica, Odus, Faydwer, Kunark and Velious combined. <br />
<br />
So how can one catch up to be able to hang in UF? Do I just try and raid (and die alot) to hope for upgrades so I can survive? <br />
<br />
I can't play all day to do group stuff (if it would even help with SoD content) and when I'm on I only see raiding as an option to progress until I am able to join UF groups on non raid nights. <br />
<br />
Am I seeing this right?</div></div><hr />

As a melee class, expect tier 5 Sod group gear, as your entry point, well, for monks, plate tanks, and rangers anyways.</div></div><hr />
