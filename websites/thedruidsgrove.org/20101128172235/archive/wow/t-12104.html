<br />
So I dodged 3 Hurtful Strikes in a row last night.<br />
<br />
Great right?<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
I need rage! Without getting hit during those first few Hurtful strikes.....I can't generate rage fast enough to alllow the DPSers to do their jobs.<br />
<br />
So I used Enrage. A few times.<br />
<br />
Is there an addon that tracks my personal timers and tells me when a CD is up with a flash on my screen or anything?<br />
<br />
Also in cat form this could tell me when Mangle and Maim are back, aslo in Bear it could tell me when Bash is available.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea of an addon that can do this?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty subtle, but enough to get your attention too ( really helped with monitoring swiftmend CDs ).<br />

Is that something you'd want?<br />
<br />
And here's the other I was thinking of...PULSE ( I kept searching for heart or beat and it wasn't working &gt;.&lt; )<br />
