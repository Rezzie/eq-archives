Level 60 wolf form not having a mana regen component was probably an intentional decision, so that it could stack with Mask of the Hunter.</div></div><hr />

Heck, I would be thrilled if it would keep your normal faction.  I'm not asking for a free gift but just not to have 99% of the mobs who normally ignore you suddenly decide you are bin Ladin with $25 million on your head.<br />
<br />
Once you get the Mask spells, you will find you will not be using wolf form much because being KOS to NPCs gets you killed.  Either that or you kill the NPC that attacks you and ruin your faction.<br />

SOE hates wolf form.  No reason, they just killed it.</div></div><hr />

As far as wolf form, yes its been nerfed heavily.  From level 54 to 60, everyone used wolf form when possible.  Now, everyone uses SOE/FOE and forgoes wolf.  You can especially see this as we have no AA's and no level 61+ spells for wolf form.<br />
<br />
Even tree form has been nerfed more heavily.  Spirit of the Oak overwrites KEI.<br />

To revive WF (and treeform) they need to remove the KOS.  Either keep your own faction or take on a nuetral faction (that would be nice).   Keep the Mana Regen, Run Speed and ATK boosts and make it stackable with mask, manasong, kitty crack and KEI and any ATK buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what is needed to fix wolf form:<br />
<br />
1.) Faction issues. This was the main part you went over. Changing into a wolf shouldn't alter your faction at all with almost all NPCs / mobs. Only in a few rare cases should your faction be altered as a wolf. <br />
<br />
Examples of the exceptions are: <br />
a.) Unrest should remain a place where the mobs ignore wolves. <br />
b.) Gorenaire can continue to hate wolves / illusions if SOE really wants that. <br />
c.) If I recall correctly, Kithicor Forest has an NPC that you need to give something to for the druid epic. This NPC will attack druids unless they are in wolf form. Naturally, the NPC should continue to give wolves a break.<br />
d.) Lesser Faydark brownie merchants should continue to shop with wolves.<br />
e.) Certain other merchants should also continue to shop with wolves. <br />
f.) Several other exceptions should be made, however 99% of mobs and NPCs should see the wolf form druid with exactly the same faction as the non wolf form druid.<br />
<br />
2.) The wolf form attack animation should be changed or removed. People decline to become wolves because the animation makes them queasy.<br />
<br />
3.) Wolf form spells should be adjusted to be useful. People decline to become wolves because the benefits are almost non existent.<br />
<br />
4.) Every wolf form spell should work both indoors and outdoors. LDoN gave us a few new wolf spells that work indoors. However, adding even more spells with different effects just makes it more confusing and difficult. The LDoN wolf form spells should be removed from the game, the adventure points refunded and all wolf from spells should work both indoors and outdoors.<br />
<br />
5.) Wolf form spells should overwrite the Mask spells. Unless the number of buff slots is increased for players, the wolf form spell of the correct level should have the same effects as the Mask spell, add the extra effects (such as movement increase), and replace it in the buff box. This would entail creating new wolf form spells to match the Mask spells. The only reason the Mask spells were created in the first place was to replace wolf form when it was badly nerfed. I think Mask spells should remain in the game but if you use the same level wolf spell, it should overwrite it with the same effects plus the wolf form extra effects.<br />
<br />
6.) As entailed above, all wolf form spells should be adjusted and some new ones added to the game.<br />
<br />
7.) SOE should understand that wolf form is fun! I love being a wolf just because it is so cool. Fun is what a game is about. The destruction of wolf form told all druids and rangers that fun was bad.<br />
<br />
8.) Wolf form should remain upon players after zoning. The only reason I am glad it doesn't currently is because evacing into an area where the NPCs hate wolf form will get you killed. Fixing the faction problem would remove that problem. Since the wolf graphic is now in the global file, there is no need to strip it from players when zoning because you can now (in theory) be a wolf in every zone.<br />

OK, you made me do this.  When I went to Vegas Fan Faire this year (quite possibly my last Fan Faire).  I decided to ask the same question I ask the developers at the first Fan Faire I went to in Seattle.  I asked about the faction issues with wolf form.  They did not seem too interested in the question. After the developers shot down my request for a faction change to Wolf Form at Fan Faire.  I asked about the animation and it's effects on attack speed and they flattly denied it had any effect.  The developer I spoke to seemed to indicate that the side effects of wolf form where there to offset the awesome uberness we get by being wolves.  He also indicated that since it was only a druid issue it wasn't a top priority.  Which made the other developers laugh for some reason.  At that point I didn't have the heart to challenge his ignorance by mentioning ranger get wolf form too.  That probably would have brought on another snide coment anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">07-09-2004, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chenier and Scirocco are posting on TDG so either they aren't reading my posts or they don't think they need to respond.<br />
<br />
While I don't want to be a pest, I don't think it is too much to ask that they say, &quot;Yes, I read what you wrote.&quot; and either &quot;I don't care about wolf form&quot;  or &quot;I'll consider what you have written and if I think it should be discussed further will do so&quot;<br />
<br />
At least some answer so that I don't lump them with the silent treatment I'm used to from SOE :)<br />
<br />
And heck, when I posted to a SOE developer about how the General walk for the 8th shawl quest has been bugged since day one, he actually responded and says he tested it with the new collision code due out next patch and saw no problems.<br />
<br />
So come on guys, you can't let SOE be more responsive than you.  I mean, next thing is we will see flying pigs.</div></div><hr />
