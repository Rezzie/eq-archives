Nin, just wait until you get there.  Yxxta is an enormous PITA for a soloer, and you won't get too far in either way with those kyv's lurking at the archway.<br />
 <br />
Once in Qvic, meldstones will drop like candy while farming Msha's, not to mention that you'll be able to solo any non-named mob in there - mobs in Qvic don't summon.<br />
 <br />
I suggest that if you do solo in there and you get any tongue drops that you keep them.  There's an uber Tacvi quest for a belt/neck piece for collecting tongues.  Click on either my druid's or BL's sig to check it out.</div></div><hr />

I wonder why you do not pull the animals in KT rather than the Ukuns and Rak's. I'd have thought grabbing a hynid or crag at the western straight next to the 1st temple and dragging, snared, up the hill and rooting it/dotting it there. The animals and huminoid mobs are on a different faction. Unless you have a bank roll I'd sell every 3rd meldstone that drops to pay for the merchant component of the armour combine.</div></div><hr />

gonna guess and say 1 in 15<br />
 <br />
Once in qvic, solo muramites in qvic at the real zone in (ie kt side) if you want to farm stones. XP from qvic muramites sucks, though.<br />
 <br />
you can solo anything in here as a druid, just watch out for the named and Mshas... and keep a VERY safe distance from the kyvs, one of their 3 debuffs include a vicious snare they cast around 30% and below.</div></div><hr />

At least I'm able to on my Necromancer. Well-geared Druid should be able to accomplish the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lujayne</div><div class="date">08-01-2006, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Animals in KT are easier to solo then the Muramites in my opinion.  Usually I test to see if the mob summons with one dot before I kill it.  There's a bit of risk involved in pulling to various corners in the Ikkinz raid area but if your good enough you can pull it off.  Having a 2.5 second cast Egress helps.<br />
<br />
Alternatively just take a group and kill Muramites in Yxtta, the drop rate of Meldstones seems high.  Working on the Cragbeast Queen belt quest there ( killing wary hynids ) over two nights of about 4 hours of killing my group picked up 24 Meldstones ( so we ended up with four each ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninenu</div><div class="date">08-05-2006, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for all the info guys..... I've tried soloing KT and Yxxta....I've found the Yxxta caves by far the easiest place yet. Once you kill the first one or two (cragbests, spiders, beetle things) you've got plenty of room to run around and nothing has summoned me in there yet. The only issue's are you have to run through the riddle's to open the door and I get far fewer Meldstone drops off them then I do In KT. <br />
 <br />
In KT I've tried Pulling an animal (crag or hynid) to the Natimbi zone line, which is pretty simple and straightforward but once again I dont get many meldstones that way and an occational crag summons so I've got the same issue as above. Its just as simple for me to pull the rak and ukuns to the Yxxta zone line in KT and the meldstone droprate there seems much higher. I always seem to get one or two meldstones at least before a mob summons me and I have to retreat back into the Yxxta cames.<br />
 <br />
Ok so last night we beat Uqua Woohoo. We promply zoned into Qvic and procceded to pull and kill the only two Msha that were up. got 2 bracers, gloves and an aug to drop and in the proccess 3 or 4 meldstones dropped so I'm under the impression that the drop rate here is much higher than KT and Yxxta (which is what Tenielle said). So it seems I dont really need to farm them anyway lol. <br />
 <br />
But...<br />
 <br />
I'm the adventerous type and would like to see if I can solo in Qvic like you guys say..... So my question is where is the best place to try soloing here. When I zone into the little cubbie there are lots of roamers and SI around.... I figure that just to the left of that area might be ok.... what do you guys think? Also I evaced to the KT zone line to see if that would be a better place but from that bridge It doesnt look like I've got much room and there are several SI mobs so I can go deeper in that way without help.<br />
 <br />
Also Tenielle said that any non named here is soloable... does that mean that the kvy and ukun can be snared here? I'm not uber enough to take many hits before I retire to the guild lobby :)<br />
 <br />
Anyway thanks for all the info in advanced !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">08-05-2006, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you can pretty much solo anything in Qvic. The &quot;ghost&quot; mobs in the tunnel towards Inktu'ta seem to have less HP, and cast...so are far easier than the regular mobs. However I have never seen them drop the meldstones.<br />
<br />
Meldstone drop rate also seems to be extremely fickle in Qvic. I've been duoing there with my monk a lot lately to try and finish his txe'vu backflag quest (damn ukuns!!! and sixth eye!) One day I duo'd for about 1 hour and got 3 meldstones...I've done 4 hours or so since then, and haven't gotten any more. Or maybe just one more.<br />
<br />
Its a fun place to solo tho!</div></div><hr />

I asked a fellow guildie about Qvic and he said some trash mobs do summon. Can someone confirm this? If so are they random trash mobs or are they mobs deeper in the zone?<br />
<br />
Also if someone can provide a decent camp spot, I would be very grateful.</div></div><hr />

your guildee is mistaken</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to question your expertise.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they changed the mobs a bit or they were hunting in an area you don't frequent. I would tend to trust my guildie friend as he said he was there when it happened and I double questioned him if it was trash or named. He said trash.<br />
<br />
That is why I want to know where to hunt. Qvic sounds very interesting and beneficial, but I would not want to learn by trial and error if someone else has already paved that path.</div></div><hr />

you may be referring to the trusik area, which has random summon mobs... but those don't drop meldstones anyway, which was the topic of this thread.<br />
 <br />
if you stay in the main area and don't go into any caves, no non-nameds will ever summon you.<br />
 <br />
if you do go into the trusik caves, they don't have many hps anyway and you may be able to outlast them. they also can randomly drop a 60/60 aug.</div></div><hr />

Excellent, so would there generally be a problem if I start root rotting mobs just left of the zone in (between zone in and the caves)? I see a few static mobs and  couple of roamers there. Can they be singled pulled and killed? Or do I need to pull out Nature's Serenity and do something fancy?</div></div><hr />

Well... it's been a good year since I did the tongue quest, which is the reason I was in there soloing so long.  I did it for both me and my BL alt.  BTW I suggest you keep ahold of one of each of the tongues you find.<br />
 <br />
I stopped bothering with any kind of pacifying.  I can't remember if it didn't stick or just didn't work, but it was useless.  I pulled from the zone in area when I first started - I didn't do that again.  The mobs are very social and aggro very easy there.  Don't bother.<br />
 <br />
Instead, head to the NW corner where zoo spawns, start from the mob north of the txevu zone in and work clockwise around the tower to the NE.  If you're careful, you can get all singles.  If you have any skill at all adds aren't too big a deal unless one of em is a Kyv, if that happens it's a good idea to kill the other mob first, cause you'll more than likely be snared if the kyv drops below 30%.  Also the anueks dispell and the anuek bonemenders CH, but it's not a huge deal, especially if you stick a chaotic strike aug in a crap weapon and start smacking it from behind with it.<br />
 <br />
Bout all I can tell ya, rest is trial and error.  So go trial.</div></div><hr />

Thats where I have been soloing.  Most come single but I dont see this as a good xp spot.</div></div><hr />
