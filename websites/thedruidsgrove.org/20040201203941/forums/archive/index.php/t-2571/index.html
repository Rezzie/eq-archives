<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just wondering, those of you who level and do AAXP at the same time, what percentage do you set your AA bar to? I want to do both leveling while gaining AA points, but I don't want to have to stop and/or alternate every level or point I earn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Since levels &gt;&gt; AAXP, I'd strongly suggest you go full leveling until you hit 65.  But if you want to gain levels and AAXP at roughly the same pace, set the slider at about 20% AAXP.  That way you can get two dings for almost the price of one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, with a few exceptions.<br />
<br />
I'd highly recommend getting run speed 3 by level 55 or so.  It will save your life many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks, I've been pondering this eversince I hit 40 and now I have 1 level to go for it so it was kinda like what do I do. I was originally considering 50/50 but told that it would make everything seem extremely slow. Anyone know what the difference between Run 3 and Form of the Great Wolf is speedwise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tiniane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Run 3 is about J-Boots speed (i.e. slower than SoW)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER - it's a permanent effect, can't be dispelled, works in dungeons, and is fast enough that I quite often forget to SoW myself these days :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>greggo rumbletum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you group a lot SotW is well worth having.  Otherwise levels are much better than AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, Seeing as how I solo on occasion and group everyday I should kind of work towards AAs to improve my group performance?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tudamorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&lt;blockquote&gt;Oryane says:&lt;hr&gt;I should kind of work towards AAs to improve my group performance?[/quote]You'll improve your group performance best by leveling.  Higher levels mean better spells, more mana, better mana regen, less resists, more hit points, and better tanking ability.  Run Speed 3 is nice for dungeons but not essential if you're not pulling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Levels = Better nukes, buffs, dots, heals.<br />
Levels = More POP Zones to exp in<br />
Levels = Faster exp in higher POP zones<br />
<br />
Level &gt; AA's unless your saving yourself for Naggy/Vox raids.<br />
I'd race on to 65 once I had a couple AA's then start filling in.  <br />
<br />
My first 3 would go for run3, why?  It's indoors and permanent<br />
<br />
Then its time to race on to level 65.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually, I would like to go on a few Naggy/Vox raids so maybe I should hold off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Friend of mine did that, held of leveling to attend naggy/vox raids.  He had a monk that had 15 AA (pre POP) by the time he hit level 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, I've only been on 2 dragon raids like that, One successful Naggy, and one failed Vox so I'd like to go after it until it just starts to get completely old.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rosellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I usually have exp going to both AA and level. I'm about a level ahead of my husband, and we hunt together most of the time, so I figured I'd focus on AA's for awhile. <br />
<br />
I found 70% AA, 30% Level works really well if you want to focus on AA's and still make some progress toward your level. I usually ding an AA once every evening or evening and a half (depending on play time). Plus, I'm making progress on getting level 64. I love how the levels seem to go fast because I'm focusing on AA's, and I get lots of dings in the meantime. :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Eridalafar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Also if your are getting a lot higher in level that your friends or guildmate, you can go 100% aaxp for the time they level up to your level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am FAR from surpassing my friends and guildies in levels. It's weird because I REALLY want AAs but I REALLY want levels. I really don't know which to focus on and while I could wait for Dragon raids, I don't like going on pickup raids. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Oldoak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Basically, it all depends.<br />
<br />
Are you in a raid guild?  Then level first, and without hesitation.  You need the levels for the resists, hp, mana pool, etc, as well as to keep the officers off your back.<br />
<br />
If you play more casually, I really DON'T think the difference between being 63 and 65 will matter to you tremendously, but certain AAXP abilities like SOTW WILL.<br />
<br />
I can't really say what I would judge best without knowing where you are, but I will give you my own personal experience.<br />
<br />
I leveled to 65 gradually.  I hit the level neither first nor last in my guild.  When POP was new, hitting level 65 (and even level 63) seemed like a great thing to get access to all those spells, right?  Only, at the time, no one in my guild had access to places where they dropped with any regularity.  So, unless you are in an elemental guild, what spells you might get at 65 are irrelevant to your decision.  You will get them, but it will take long enough (even if you are rich in plat) that you would have time to level and AA many times over before you finish.<br />
<br />
But...back to my experience.<br />
<br />
I alternated between leveling and AA'ing.  The reality for me at the time was that my experience time tended to be in short stints or late night, and groups were hard for me to get with those restrictions.  Why spend 20 minutes looking for a group if I would only be in it for an hour?  It wouldn't be fair to the people who took me in.  I could get great solo experience in PON at 61, but at 65 it would begin to get pretty sucky.  I also had only about 40AA at the time POP came out so even with the old skills I was missing a lot of useful stuff.  <br />
<br />
So, I would do a level, then grind AA with a specific goal in mind, usually a fun AA that felt like a real reward, sometimes more than one.  I would get a level, get a fun or useful skill or three.  Both improve your character, and I definitely would not underestimate how often something like Exodus or SOTW can save your ass.  Other abilities like SCRM can add a good multiple to the rate you can earn experience, while simply adding another level will not.  <br />
<br />
Part of the fun for me was figuring out &quot;ok, which AA skills will I get once I am 20% into 62, and then which ones at 63?&quot;  It really broke up the treadmill for me, and fortuitously (really an accident) it put my timing more in line with when my guild turned our attention to POP from Luclin content. <br />
<br />
I always found the &quot;level, level, level, then you can AA...&quot; argument to be a little simplistic.  It really all depends.  But I encourage you to choose a path that you enjoy over one that the greybeards tell you is wisest.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I just looked at your Magelo and I would add a couple more points.  I hit a very similar issue when I was around 50 (well there was no AA at the time but the question of how fast should I level).  I got far ahead of most of my guildmates, and got very frustrated by not being able to do level appropriate raids with my guild, etc.  Ultimately I got too frustrated with that disparity and went to another guild.  I have no regrets at all, but at the time it was a VERY hard situation for me.  I am a pretty loyal person, and choosing what was best for me versus what was best for the guild was very hard, and it an be really hard on the friendships you form within your guild.  <br />
<br />
This is just a bit of a cautionary tale I suppose, but if you find you are 10 levels ahead of most of your guildmates and you are not interested in moving at any point, AA is a decent option.  If you are thinking of trying to get to 65 and do more end game raiding, level will be the very first requirement of most guilds you try to get into.<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO RIGHT ANSWER to this question, no matter how often people post the contrary view.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tiniane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Oldoak hit the nail on the head.<br />
<br />
Do what you want to do. Look at the spells you get next level or two (and your chances of getting hold of those spells), compare them to the AAs you want - which are more valuable to you?<br />
<br />
Consider the average level of your friends and guild as well.<br />
<br />
Personally I levelled to 60 the day before PoP came out and raised the level cap to 65. Having grinded (ground?) my way to 60 (mainly by soloing) I wanted a bit of a change, so I went through level 60 on 90% AA, only going to 100% AA when I was in danger of dinging 61. At the time my Guild was not getting many parchments, and had never seen a rune, so my chances of getting my 61-65 spells were slim.<br />
<br />
I got enough AAs to get my Venerable title, and got Exodus as well before going back to 100%xp and heading up to level 65. By the time I dinged 61 I had all my 61 and 62 spells in the bank, as Ethereals had become more common.<br />
<br />
Don't let anyone tell you there is a right way and a wrong way of working with AA and normal xp. Do it the way that suits you.<br />
<br />

Tiniane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Oryane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, What I think I'll do is just level with my AA bar to 30%. I really want AAs but I don't like not being able to go on a raid because I am too low which has been happening a lot since I'm getting into the planes more.</div></div><hr />
