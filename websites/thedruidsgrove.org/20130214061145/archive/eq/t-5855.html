Ease off the throttle, bud.  It's a free service that's also immensely popular.  I'm shocked their equipment managed to stay together for as long as it did.  They've been planning hardware upgrades and code-rewrites for a while now.  For a service that costs NOTHING.  They've had a bad week and my best wishes go out to them.</div></div><hr />

Magelo is now the absolute worst service in the world.  Originally designed to give people a useful tool to organize their own gear, spells, and AA points in a fashion that everyone can see, as well as build dream gear inventories to see where they might take their stats, Magelo is now a useless pile of crap.  The only service they offer now is a white page that reads &quot;Cannot find server&quot;.  What's worse, is this is not a unique service.  www.uselesswebpagesthatreallysuck.com offers this service as well, and perhaps they do it better.  Their &quot;Cannot find server&quot; page loads much quicker.<br />
<br />
Apparently some of you have spent money on the Magelo service.  I have seen many say that $12 / year is not that much.  Today I went to spend that money, and I cannot even get to the registration page!  I really felt like throwing $12 in the garbage today, but decided Magelo could have it.  Oh well, I guess I can still throw it in the trash.<br />
<br />
Fix it dammit!  Fix it now!  <br />
<br />
So, you're ranting about something that you've used, but have payed absolutely nothing for?  It used to be that people were happy when they got a free lunch, now it not only has to be free, it has to be caviar and a $100 wine lunch?  Hush, only the people that have actually payed for the service can even have a remote legitimate reason to bitch.<br />

If it went away, I'd be saddened and looking for a good alternative, but I wouldn't feel that I was ripped off.<br />
<br />
I pay a good $100+ a month for my cable and it certainly isn't ALWAYS available. My ISP isn't ALWAYS available.<br />
<br />
Magelo's performance and availability has been poor lately, but what service do you think they OWE to the EQ community? People have just been amazingly spoiled by the internet and the generally freely available information out there. <br />
<br />
There is no free lunch. If all of the people who complain about the performance, service, etc. but don't pay actually bought the premium service, then maybe the site would be much better. Personally, I'm annoyed with all of the freeloaders who slow down the site that I help pay for. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) Move all the free accounts to the a slow magelo server<br />
<br />
b) Move all the paying accounts to a nice fast server<br />
<br />
<br />
If your logged onto your premium account showing magelo profiles are fast.....if your logged onto or not logged on its just slow speed.<br />
<br />
So basically....if you want performance...you pay.<br />
<br />
<br />
Atm the only problem magelo has is that premium people dont get any benefit in speed against the cheap people who wont pay, that needs to change imho.<br />

I can say I did not pay for it as I had no problem with the service I had. Why would you belittle those who choose not to pay for a higher service?<br />
<br />
You want to throw your nose up in the air to say you are better? Sorry Tils your post just hit me wrong.<br />
<br />
I have no complaints with Magelo and because one person got upset and posted his frustrations, all of a sudden non paying people should be slammed.<br />
<br />
If Magelo wants to make everyone pay for their services that is their option. It also your option to decide if you want to pay. No one is forcing you to.</div></div><hr />

Then people who are griping because the free service they've been depedent on will either go away or else become paying customers and gripe (which is fine).<br />
<br />
Man, if you're not paying anything for it, they don't even spam you with ads, then I just can't see how you can complain about it.   If they cut the moochers off,  the server load would be a teeny fraction of what it currently is and perhaps a whole lot more reliable.</div></div><hr />

Bandwidth costs money<br />
Time invested in development and upkeep costs money<br />
<br />
Magelo has a free method and a pay for method.<br />
<br />
Those people who believe the service is worth supporting do so, just like these forums. But there are alot of people who enjoy &quot;free&quot; things. Remember magelo is not free to those who run the operation, last thing you can do if you are not a supporter is to bitch, moan or complain. Guess what, the people who have any right to complain are those that paid, and as one of those people, I believe magelo.com has treated me fairly and has allowed me to enjoy the game a bit more.<br />
<br />
Those people ranting about it being down or unreliable and yet have invested no money towards the service, you are best to take your whines elsewhere, there is not enough fromage here in TDG to compliment them.</div></div><hr />

At one time it was free to everyone. Now they offer a premium service and those that pay consider themselves better? You knew when you gave them your money it was still offered free to those that chose not to pay. <br />
<br />
Yes one person came here to post their frustrations about the site being down. Shrug it will be up sooner or later. <br />
<br />
I also pay plenty for cable, pay for eq and lived withoug Magelo for a long time until my guild recommends us to have a magelo, Should I have them pay for it (sarcasm) ?<br />
<br />
Guess we were all moochers before premium was offered or maybe some of you donated to Magelo even before premium services were offered? If you did then my hat is off to you.<br />
<br />
Also aren't there other sites that offer a site similar to Magelo for free? I'm sure if magelo dropped the non-paying service they might lose potential customers in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;If you didn't vote, you can't complain.&quot;<br />
<br />
People who didn't vote certainly do complain.  Just like the original poster complaining about Magelo.<br />
<br />
I think the problem Magelo supporters have with the original post is this comment:<br />
<br />
&quot;Fix it dammit! Fix it now!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a rant to be sure, but to demand that someone serve you because it is what they have always done smacks of spoiled brat.  The Magelo fellas provided their service for free and asked for donations (and a little bit more streamlined service) to help offset the cost of maintaining that service.<br />
<br />
If they took their service down and never brought it back up, it would be a shame but well within their rights.  They are not obliged to serve.  They performed a service because it pleased them to serve.  I for one hope they come back.</div></div><hr />

Magelo is down for emergency changes to get it working again. For some time you've been noticing performance problems. Behind the scenes, the cause has been a real mystery. Small changes weren't doing the trick, so now a bigger change is in order. Jelan will explain it all on magelo's News page when the service comes back up. Unfortunately, because the whole apparatus has to be down to make the changes there's no way to put up a sign saying &quot;Down for emergency maintenance.&quot; At least this time. I'm going to speak to Jelan about changing that policy, but that'll have to be enacted later. Right now the focus is on making the new stuff work. ETA is 'when the %@$# thing works, hehe'. Sorry I can't be more precise than that at this time.<br />
<br />
Until then, folks, please be patient. An even better solution is on the way. New features, a new internal framework, better reliability, quicker turn-around are all coming. Work is on-going to make it so. No one is being dropped. The site certainly isn't going away. The people laboring on it aren't stopping. And you don't have to do a thing or pay any more than you do, if you pay at all. Isn't that a good thing? :)<br />
<br />
Got it? Good, now relax, take a breath, enjoy the game, and for a relatively small window of time just keep in mind what you have on your character(s) while away from your computer(s). I am confident you can do that. :)<br />

As for now, we're so used to Magelo downtimes (this is the worst I've seen in a while, if ever) that we are just assuming they are working on the problem.  But that is a half-assed assumption.  It has been down nearly 3 days now, and the downtime has been horrendous (about 50%) over the last month or so.  Paid or not, a service that is at best 50% reliable is a horrible service. 50%?  Where on EARTH did you get 50%?<br />
<br />
As for the pay vs non-pay... <br />
I pay for Magelo.  Three days = $.09?  OMIGOD!  Less than a dime!  And I would gladly pay twice that for the service I feel that I receive.  <br />
<br />
BUT those of you complaining... Even though I love Magelo I am seeing that you think even more of it than I do.  Has it become such an obsession with some of you to the point of ruining your EQ experience?  I'm impressed that an EQ amenity has such an impact on you and your game (not to mention, blood pressure).  Despite the complaints I *hope* that the people who run Magelo take the complaints as indicators of just how much the EQ community has come to depend on them and can smile.<br />
<br />
Thank you Ontree!  I know that there are so many sites that are EQ related and Magelo can't hit them all to explain down time.  I appreciate you taking the time to post here.</div></div><hr />

Then why open up the site for public consumption if it's their own personal 'thing'? If you are going to then charge money but make damn sure it works. There's no sense of entitlement in wanting a site you use to work most of the time, free or not.  <br />
<br />
this made me /cackle.<br />
<br />
here's why...  the word entitlement being slung around as if you were entitled to be irate about a lack of service that was never presented to you in the first place.<br />
<br />
YOU went to magelo... YOU made an account... YOU used their labour...  YOU are entitled to nothing.  nowhere did MAGELO come to YOU and say 'i give you my shiz!'  They made it available, but nobody forced you to use it.  <br />
<br />
let me repeat: YOU are entitled to nothing.  not even to post on this board.  the mods can ban someone for saying 'cheese' if they so choose.<br />
<br />
if you use any web site you are at the whim of the owner keeping it available for you.  if you give that person ten bucks to keep it available for you and recieve no written guarentee that they are providing the service for you, then you are not only a fool, but you still are entitled to nothing.  not to mention out ten bucks.<br />
<br />
if you want a service, you pay for it, if you don't want to pay, you can't bitch.  if you pay and the service sucks, you cancel.  if you don't pay and the service sucks, you stfu and go pay allah ten bucks and make a profile there.<br />
<br />
omg, i can't access my magelo!  the world is ending!  play the damn game, fools.<br />
<br />
:boohoo: <br />
<br />
that represents the only emoticon the cackler has used... enjoy!<br />
<br />

That's the reason why I didn't use it until 6 or so months ago. I never had a real reason to until the guild I joined wanted all it's members to make a profile so they could keep track of people's gear and such. <br />
<br />
Well that's something you should take up with your guild then :D <br />
<br />
Magelo itself isn't forcing you to us it.<br />
<br />
My guild also requires members to have profiles but I'm not gonna lose sleep over a few days or even a few weeks without it.<br />
<br />
Edit Note: I have been nothing short of amazed at what Jelan has done and I think people need to get off his back and let him finish his work in peace.  I'd rather see him take his time and get it right the first time.</div></div><hr />

He has always supported the Grove and always given us exclusive updates on the Magelo Service. I very much respect Onetree and will always hold him in high regard with his professionalism towards any negative or positive post about the Magelo Service.<br />

If we use the service and they put it out for public use then they are resposible for making it work.<br />
This is a huge crock of sh*t.<br />
I have developed several sites and small things for free. I support what I develop, only because it's within my capability to do so, without any cost to me.<br />
If/when something begins to cost me money, or takes up too much bandwith, then I will in no way be required to support it, keep it running or anything else. I don't owe the public anything, if anything then the public owes me for delivering the service in the first place.<br />
<br />
To take an example..<br />
The little counter below, in my signature, there are allready some people that are using that. Hell, I made it for personal use, then a few guildies asked if they could use it as well so I made it a bit easier for them to create it. Now I see people from a variety of servers using the counter, but I can guarantee you, that if it takes up too much bandwith, or I need new hardware for my server, then I will take it down, and then people can whine all they like, won't help them one bit. I provided the service for free, and I make no guarantees, except that I decide when it's coming down, and why. And the server it's being hosted on is actually coming down this monday (15th. December), and you know what? Some people will find it annoying, but that's really too bad for them.</div></div><hr />

You can't honestly hold it against them. The service does have a &quot;free&quot; option.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone really has an issue with people not paying. What ruffled feathers is the combination of:<br />
<br />
1. Not paying for the service.<br />
2. Complaining that the Magelo &quot;owes&quot; it to their users to be up, even if they didn't pay.<br />
<br />
It's the sense of &quot;gimme gimme gimme&quot; attitude that is obnoxious. I actually think that Magelo, Allakhazam, etc. are adopting the only internet model that works well - free &quot;basic&quot; access and pay &quot;premium&quot; access. That achieves the critical mass that sites like that need (in one sense, they NEED a large user base to be valuable, unlike a site such as Lucy... which I know is going to Allakhazam ;)).<br />
<br />
In terms of why people miss Magelo when it's down, it isn't at all about &quot;penis comparison,&quot; for some of us. I'm solidly entrenched in the casual side of the game and my equipment would pale in comparison to a raiding person - and that doesn't matter to me. I use Magelo to keep track of my own progress and for the alternative profiles. For example, I've been debating on picking up a Black Plated Collar but am not sure that it's worth the cash - adding it to a Magelo profile makes the decision much easier, since they take into account all of my AA's, the level of my stats currently, etc. <br />
<br />
That is 90% of the use of Magelo for me. The rest of the time, I check Magelos when people on the paladin board ask for advice about what they should upgrade. I clearly remember the days when such a post involved typing out everything you were currently using - now, we just say, &quot;here's my Magelo, what should I be looking at for upgrades?&quot;<br />
<br />
The &quot;penis comparisons&quot; comes in for the sites that RANK Magelo profiles, and I can honestly say I've never visited one. The only person I'm competing with in the game is myself (ok, and maybe my wife... just a little ;)).<br />
<br />
There's something ironic going on when the loudest complainers are the ones who aren't paying and the biggest supporters are the ones who are paying (maybe there's some cognitive dissonance going on there...).</div></div><hr />

There's this thing called freedom of speech that allows people to complain about something if they want to whether they pay for it or not. If it's a service and if it doesn't live up to their expectations then they are allowed to not like it. Should people be happy they can't access Magelo(or any other site for that matter)? It's their right to be disgruntled so deal with it.<br />
<br />
There's a solution to all this: just require everyone to pay for the Magelo service. But if they're going to do that then the service better damn work. This society has gotten into a trend of either ignoring or rewarding inferior workmanship and that's why we have the large volume of bad customer service and shoddy products we do nowadays.<br />
<br />
All that begs the real issue presenting itself here now. Nobody deserves to be personally attacked just because they choose not to pay for a website and if there was any real moderation it wouldn't happen. Oh wait a minute, even one of the mods has resorted to name calling so I guess we can't expect that. Here's the bottomline: if some of you can't post why you disagree without flaming people's personal preferences by name calling then you need to step the hell off.  <br />
<br />
There is also a thing called freedom of speach that let's me tell you how silly you are for ranting about something that is free.    You may not like mine.  But just like I can't tell you to hush and deal with it, neither can you tell me not to voice an opinion on the pettiness of ranting over something you're not paying for. :)<br />

<br />
It isn't understandable to me.<br />
<br />
Some people are ranting level upset that Magelo is down.  Other people got upset at the people who are upset that Magelo is down even though they are using the free service option.  In response, the first set of upset people get upset and indignant that the second set of upset people are upset at them.<br />

Frankly, attempting to defend entitlement to a service that is provided at the pleasure of the provider (as opposed to the user) is unwise.  Sun Tzu would be upset.</div></div><hr />

As long as you don't pay for the service, you have no rights, claims, entitlements or whatever you wish to think you have to the contents of that service.<br />
What I develop is mine, and mine to chose whatever I wish to do with it. If I wish to put it publicly available for other people to use for free, but don't want to offer any support on it, that is my choice. If I decide to take down a free service with 50,000 users, because I don't want to spend my time developing it, or supporting it anymore, then it's my choice, and there is not a damn thing you can do about it, except not using it.</div></div><hr />

I've written software and made it available for free and every now and then you get some rude jerk who finds something about it they don't like.  Rather than politely asking for bug fix, modification or usually they just don't understand how to use it, they post something completely hostile.  It really makes you *NOT* want to help them and you start to question your why you bother with people who take advantage of something free and demand more.<br />

i respect what the fine people at magelo have done for the eq community and i say kudos to them. <br />
<br />
The people that have payed magelo have a right to say something about it. <br />
The people who have not have no right to complain about something they are not paying for, and not forced to use. It is bull as another poster said, to do so, and completely selfish. If i was one of the magelo staff i would personally ban dennis's ip and do whatever else i could to keep him from using the magelo services, as he is obviously completely ungrateful about it, and as such does not really deserve to be using the service.

... you people defending bad service whether paid for or not are wrong. It turned out Magelo had a good reason to be down, but that doesn't excuse other sites that may offer bad service.Yes, Magelo had a good reason to be down yet a few people were altogether too quick to bash the site and it's providers without any knowledge of the reason.  Unfortunately this is far too common in EQ and the internet in general.<br />
<br />
Magelo is a very popular site.  I am still awed every time I use it.  I suppose we could all fuss at them for not being able to keep up with the tens of thousands from EQ who are probably using it, but instead I think everyone should be encouraged to buy the premium service in order to help them meet the demand and move forward!<br />
<br />
I'm curious Onetree... <br />
Is there a count of exactly how many users Magelo serves, the number of character profiles they provide and what percentage of those are premium vs free?  It might give some non-premium users a better insight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If magelo usage were not so widespread, it would be less useful.  If everyone had to pay to use it, it would be used far less, reducting its functionality.  Thus reducing the number of people who would be willing to pay for a service that fewer and fewer people use!<br />

It's a cycle, but it's an important part of any internet business model.<br />

<br />
When I was in the Army, I was stationed in Germany for awhile.<br />
<br />
I took some time off and we took a bus tour of Switzerland. We got into town and had some time to run around and look at stuff and I saw this neat little chair lift going up the side of a hill. It was the middle of Summer and I was wearing shorts and a Tshirt so I got in line, paid for a ticket and hopped on.<br />
<br />
The view was amazing!<br />
<br />
As the chair lift got higer up the hill I was looking behind me at the valley and the mountains around. These were real mountains! I mean, the kind of things that rise straight up even thought you are a few miles away from them. It made me re-evaluate my definition of &quot;big&quot;.<br />
<br />
After about 5 minutes, I started noticing that the chairlift was still going and it had these switchbacks that went around trees and little bluffs so you couldn't see too far ahead. I was still looking mostly behind at the valley and the snow on the mountains on the other side of the valley.<br />
<br />
It was sometime around here that I started to notice something.<br />
<br />
It was getting cold.<br />
<br />
I don't mean, chilly, I mean, snow-in-the-shadows-of-trees cold.<br />
<br />
Great, the ride was still going!<br />
<br />
After about 25 minutes or so, I got to the top of the Mountain, and got off the chair lift There were guys there with heated big leather duster style jackets ready and they tossed one to me just chuckling.  I had seriously thought about jumping off that thing like 10 times but decided it would suck more getting a broken leg from dropping off a chair lift and THEN freezing to death.<br />
<br />
I walked around up there for a little while, looked at the Eiger and the Young frau (Virgin) Mountains with view finders, then hopped back on the lift and rode down. When I got off the thing at the bottom, I noticed a big closet they had to hang the jackets in. <br />
<br />
Bleh, will teach me to pay attention from now on!</div></div><hr />

I have been patiently awaiting its return but I now have a bunch of symbols when I goto the home page or any magelo link.  This is a new problem for me, never had this before.<br />
<br />
    I am having my same old porblems. I am posting this here to see if I reach a broader audience and possibly get some some ideas.<br />
<br />
My Magelo Troubles........<br />
<br />
1 My old password from long ago won't work, like my magelo account has been deactivated.....but..... when I try to register and use that email account as part of the registration it says that that email account is currently being used. I know for a fact that I have the correct password. I keep all of them on disc. <br />
<br />
2 So I read the FAQ's and did all the suggestions. Tools---Internet options---advanced---Yadda Yadda Yadda. I did them all including the windows critical update downloads. No change.<br />
<br />
3 So i figured I would create a new email address and reregister. Then it says my new email account is invalid. So I try a third new email account...same thing. So I try to email stuff to the new account from different comps etc ...the emails work.<br />
<br />
4 So I figure search the Magelo message board and find a post about the same issue. I find one, it has been there many days with no response. I go to add my support to that person's thread and notice that the Magelo Message board has no &quot;new thread&quot; &quot;add reply&quot; options anywhere on the screen. Hhhhrrrmmm. Getting frustrated with Magelo.<br />
<br />
5 So I break down and email the webmaster and have gotten no response to date but he/she has been very busy (I understand).<br />
<br />
I have re-tried everything after the new servers were put in place and get the same issues... <br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />

Also can install an extension and have right click options on images to ad block them, or adblock iframes(extension is called Adblock oddly enough =-p)<br />
Also a button where you can see all the adblockable things onthe page, and block them from there. Plus you can also block flash ads, has a little tab above the flash, which you can then press and block it.<br />
<br />
I also use Tabbrowser Extensions to get my tabs the way I like them.. used Netcaptor for so long, couldn't stand the tabs up at the top and acting all wierd =-p</div></div><hr />

It's free. :p  Although, I thought it was so good I made a donation. Anyway, like a virus scanner, you have to update it periodically.<br />

The Google pop-up stopper is terrific.  I also customized some settings in IE so that it will prevent 3rd party cookies.  Basically it's where cookies for other domains get set. <br />
<br />
If you're using Kazaa and some other products, you've downloaded a lot of spyware.  Just keep current with Spybot, avoid downloading crap that has spyware embedded and you should be good.</div></div><hr />

Instead of Kazza, eMule is much better =-p Also Bittorrent, though that's a different style of p2p stuff. ABC is a good BT client.. I really only use BT for getting new fansubbed Anime though, mm...Anime...</div></div><hr />

Thanks everyone for the ideas.  I basically had to download Netscape and use it on the magelo site.  IE6 just dosen't like the site for some reason.  Just wanted to say thanks and happy holidays.<br />

Go to internet explorer, tools, internet options, click on the advanced tab, then scroll down till ya see HTTP1.1 Settings. Check both of those if you are having problems with Magelo through IE. (This has been the case for a lot of our guildies and it's always worked.)</div></div><hr />
