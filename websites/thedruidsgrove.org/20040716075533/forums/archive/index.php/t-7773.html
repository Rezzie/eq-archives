Hardly matters..  was running around galaxy city on Virtue and there was no shortage of villains!<br />

It's a fun game... though my power's been going out all night from thunderstorms... graphics are cool and the fights are fast!  Someone needs to make a macro creation utility I think... seems pretty complex from reading the manual.<br />

Playing around as Lady T the blaster at the moment!  I absolutely LOVE the character creation system... its unbelievable how many choices there are in costumes.  Will probably wind up playing a few different toons hehe...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Say... I did make one character on Freedom named Electra Quetem.  And she's level 3 now.  But I'm stuck.  I have a mission that takes me to a terrible part of town where everything is deep red to her and the entrance to the place I have to go is in the middle of these horrible red things.  What on earth do you do?</div></div><hr />

And yeah, I absolutely love making characters lol...</div></div><hr />

I was so happy in beta when I discovered how to change the hair and lip color!  My first character was kind of stuck with hair matching the outfit until I discovered the rest :).  She looked fine but it's much more fun to customize everything.<br />
<br />
When running to the missions in harder places be sure to stay in the middle of the road and go around the long way if you need to staying to the roads rather than the alleys.  Once you must get in there among the baddies, if you are solo, be sure to have some healing inspirations and just run like the wind and zone in! <br />
<br />
The Vaz missions are the ones I dislike getting because of the number of mobs you must fight, those usually take a bit of leveling up if you are solo.  And really who could enjoy green zombie yuck all over them?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most villians, at lower levels, have a small aggro range and don't chase you unless you attack them.  Like Lauran said, stay on the roads and avoid anything red/purple.  Even if something aggros (and doesn't kill you in the first swipe), just keep running.  Of course, the good thing is you don't get any exp debt until 5 or 6, so just keep trying until you make it.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level 5 is the level in which you first start incruing debt on death.<br />
<br />
The agro on enemies are much different than EQ. They too have ranges and they do also have points where they'll just leave you alone (&lt; lvl 9 enemies don't initiate attacks onto my lvl 17 blaster anymore. I can even be standing right on them and not a thing.)<br />
<br />
All enemies have a chase radius where after a point in time they stop chasing you. The radius is different depending if you've actually attacked them or not. If you didn't attack them, they won't take anymore than a few steps (Unless you've stopped close by). But if you did attack them, they will chase you a block or two before they decide to give up and leave.<br />
<br />
The AI in game is quite inteligant. Many things happen in game as you would expect them in real life. What peeves me the most about the AI is when I do my Ice Storm (AE Ice Rain) the enemies will actually move *out* from unneath it! It's a good way to get them to scatter, but sucks arse cause I can only get 2-3 root under the AE at most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe, yes the AI is definitely much more interesting than in other games...   it's kinda nice that they went with the smarter/more numerous mobs vs powerful player route, as opposed to eq's one mob crazily overpowered for it's &quot;level&quot; vs a bunch of wimpy players...  I think that's one of the things I love about the game.  Taking a team of 8 people and mowing through Perez Park or a mission full of nazis, blowing away 20 at a time is just... hilariously good fun!  Especially watching some of the other heroes with knockback and gravity type powers..  things get messy lol...<br />
<br />
Anyway... here's a pic of my current favourite incarnation.  She's a technology/blaster, somewhat elfin 8)<br />

<br />
I do hope they add in the option to disable repetitive power noises, like the drone pictured above... it gives me a headache and I wind up (sadly) turning the volume down on my speakers.  A minor thing, but really detracts from the game, hope they fix it and let me turn it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok... lots of questions.  <br />
<br />
How do you take screenshots?  <br />
<br />
How do you get a new mission if you're stuck with your current mission?   <br />
<br />
I did finally get that cave mission done, but I had to go fight street punks until I leveled to get past the Reds camping outside the cave.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to rechoose a power if you made a bad decision?  I have the only level 5 Defender in the world who can only heal herself... oops.  I didn't realize choosing new powers was such an infrequent thing or that you got so few.  She's a pretty good blaster now though! :p  Maybe I'll have to remake her.<br />
<br />
I made a Defender on Freedom.  She's named:  Electra Quetem  Should've been a blaster with that name, but my cleric on EQ was named Electra.  Anyway, I made her look sort of like my cleric.  Tall, pale, long red hair, blue armor.  Only thing is, I gave her an eye patch and her Bio says she lost the eye escaping from Norrath.  /snicker<br />
<br />
And finally, anyone find any good sites with descriptions of the powers and what not?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I'm remembering correctly ss's are the print screen button.  I'll double check that and revise if it's incorrect.<br />
<br />
You will be given new contacts as you gain favor with your current contacts, by completing missions for them, so you can eventually have several missions in your log for different contacts.  I do like to keep several in there so there is a choice.  There are times when you do get kind of &quot;stuck&quot; and need to just level up some or go with friends to do their missions to get higher level for your missions, it seems to go fast though.<br />
<br />
No, once you've chosen a power you have that one until you reach the next level where you can gain another one.  I would think that since you want the powers you've chosen for you girl that just hanging in there until you can gain more will most likely be fine.  You'll eventually have the other ones you want as well.  But if it's causing you problems in any way, then level 5 isn't hard to level back up to.  If you decide to remake and have friends playing on your server be sure to pass off your unused enhancements and your influence to them to hold for the new girl :).<br />
<br />
There is a site that I enjoy but it was started in beta and the guy is still updating and correcting some mistakes, still lots of nice info there.<br />
http://www.paragoncity.com/boxhead6177/<br />
also visit http://Coh.warcry.com sometimes as well.  The CoH forums have some good info in them as well :).<br />
<br />
edit:  trying to make link work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screenshots are indeed taken with the PrintScreen button. You can only take screen shots while in the normal game view (ie viewing the world). Currently you can't take game screen shots of full screen windows like the the Login Screen, Enhancements and your ID. But you can get around that by doing the normal Print Screen and paste the screen shot into a graphic application (CoH is quite system friendly--I've ran PhotoShop and CoH at the same time w/out any noticeable slow down).<br />
<br />
The rest is pretty well answered by Lauran there. This game is 100% &quot;quest&quot; based. Don't get into the EQ frame of mind and think nothing but &quot;I gotta level to get to the good stuff&quot; cause you're already at the good stuff. Read your contact's missions and follow them. You can have upto three missions at a time, but you can only accept 1 mission from each contact at a time (pain in the buttocks since I have 5 contacts now at lvl 17 and trying to follow each one of them when I can only have 3 missions sucks arse).<br />
<br />
But, follow the story line, read what your contacts have to say. There are some really interesting story lines in there. I love some of the backstabbing that different groups are doing to each other within my mid teen stories.<br />
<br />
Oh, and also; post 10 you can start getting story arcs, which are more than just &quot;do mission&quot; deals, but a full story you follow and investigate. At the end of that you get a cool little sourvenier detailing the full story line you've just completed (like a journal). It's really cool! I have 6 of them so far. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Guice :),<br />
<br />
If you have a moment I'd like to ask you a question.  Did you always keep your powers upgraded with enhancements as best as possible or was there a time when you started saving your influence for DO and SO enhancements?<br />
<br />
So far I've been keeping mine upgraded but I saw on the boards some people saying that the SO and DO enhancements were so expensive that they thought you should just save up for them.  I joined beta rather late in the game so never got high enough to have those.  Would appreciate your opinion if you check back here :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Training ones, I always keep upgraded at least 1 above my level, sometimes two. I get tons of training enhancements, it's always worth it to keep them in the green.<br />
<br />
I don't have any SOs yet, but for DOs what I do is stock up on them when I'm of level and then wait until I get to the next level for them. Ie; at level 12, I bought a bunch of level 15 DOs in slots I felt needed/wanted the largest upgrades to (End DO a must!). I used the same DOs for the next 5 levels until I got to level 17. Once I hit 17, I switched those out for level 20 DOs.<br />
<br />
Now I'm fighting bosses and doing missions that give me DO enhancements as rewards. Those I generally stick in a slot I have free (ehancements always been of my level/mission level). If I don't need them, I give them to a guildmate or just sell them to the vendor. I strongly disbelieve in selling them to players.<br />
<br />
DOs and SOs are rather expensive. I hadn't whitness first hand the price of SOs yet, but the DOs are ~6k give or take 1k (depends on which enhancement). I've herd SOs hit the 20k range (ugh! 20k for *1* SO that lasts only 5 levels; that's pricey)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already got this storyline going wtih this guy that is kidnapping people to harvest body parts from them so he can &quot;defeat death&quot;.  And I ran into these guys that ressurrect the monsters you just killed! :P  How annoying.  So you have to kill them first.<br />
<br />
So far I've only had one contact at a time that sends me on missions.  Now I've exhausted her and she's sent me to another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 12:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I've only had one contact at a time that sends me on missions.  Now I've exhausted her and she's sent me to another one.<br />
As you work with that contact, they'll send you to another contact. The new contact will send you to another in due time as well. Just keep going with the contacts and you'll soon find you have too many!  :flipbg: <br />
<br />
A tip; keep up with *each* contact! Do a mission from each one and try to get all their cell phones as quickly as possible. Don't do contacts &quot;one at a time&quot;. I have a friend that's done that and he's finding out some of his contacts are &quot;running out&quot; of missions before he even gains the contact's full trust. This is bad, cause they have plenty of missions, you just gotta make sure you don't level up too quickly.<br />
<br />
I have 5 different contacts which I got a lvl 15. I've maxed all their trust and gotten the cell phones for each one, as well as all my contacts prior. So I know it is possible to do so. The one I spoke of must have just outleveled the contact too quickly (happens a lot if you join these &quot;xp groups&quot;).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Guice, ouch those are expensive!  But it does sound as if you had plenty of influence to keep the training ones up and then progress upward.  That being the case, I won't start holding on to influence if I need an upgrade to one.  Although, level 12 isn't far, I'll have to check influence status next time I'm in game and try to judge based on the 5 to 6K figure you gave :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cantatus</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you always keep your powers upgraded with enhancements as best as possible or was there a time when you started saving your influence for DO and SO enhancements?<br />
<br />
I do a little of both.  DOs and SOs are pretty expensive, so I only really buy them for important things.  I put two dmg DOs in my only attack spell (I'm a controller) so I could be more effective soloing.  I bought an endurance reduction enhancement for Teleport so I could travel further.  I bought some hold enhancements for Blind so I could keep them held longer.  Basically, I enhanced the most important aspect of the power.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind though that DOs are always more powerful than Training enhancments (and SO is always more powerful than DO.)  I believe you get something like an 8%-13% bonus from using training enhancements, but a 15-20% bonus from DOs.  So, even if your DO is below you're level, you're still getting more out of it than a training enhancement that is two over your level.  <br />
<br />
I'd recommend at least investing in some DOs.  You can use them for 7 levels (I believe), so it's not like you have to keep updating them if you don't want to.  They'll still be better than training ones. However, I wouldn't recommend buying a full set of them.  (You probably couldn't afford it anyways.)  Besides, once you get higher, DOs start dropping off mobs anyways (albeit rarely.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guice</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one at Warcry's great. There's a new feature in it called Legacy mode. Basically it runs just like it would in game. Each even level you get a new power and every odd level you get 2 enhancement slots. Definately worth checking out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you Cantatus :).  I do want to be able to have use of the DO's and of course later the SO's since they are so much better.  I just wasn't sure how the influence situation would go along and if I would be able to afford them when the time came if I kept upgrading my training ones.  They sound awfully expensive for what I have saved up so far at level 10.  Crossing fingers that the infulence will be there when it's needed!<br />
<br />
I have a little controller as well and she is a fun character to play.  They are deceptive in the lower levels as they seem weak, however as they get older it's pretty amazing what they can do.  Every class I've tried has been fun though, I'm really enjoying the game.<br />
<br />
Appreciate the help :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LauranCoromell</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh Pan, you may already know this, if not it may help a little :).  When you are doing your missions you will sometimes be asked to arrest 5 of such and such mobs or 10 of them and return to your contact.  The mobs are often found in groupings of just the right numbers.  Some will run though and can leave you in a situation where you either have to wait and hope they come back or have to go and kill more than you really need.  This is more experience of course but sometimes you are trying to round-robin your group's missions and just want to work through them as you can.<br />
<br />
Some things to check for are, if the guy is the one with his arms crossed or the guy who has hold of the victim's purse, or the one nearest and threatening the victim, this is most usually the guy who will break and run when you attack.  So if they are nicely numbered for your quest you most likely want that guy first and either lock him down or kill him fast so he won't break up your grouping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">05-10-2004, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently, there is a rumour of a quest you can do at level 20+ to reset one or possibly more of your powers if you have made a bad choice.  No confirmation on it yet, though.<br />
<br />
Also, tailors are coming... not sure of the specifics, but presumably they'll allow some further costume customization.  Dont expect capes, though....  capes are huge processor hogs.  Speaking of costumes, fun thing about being in a supergroup is switching into your guild colours whenever you feel like it... it's like having 2 outfits!  8)<br />
<br />
The Hero Planner from Warcry is a must have.  Keeps getting updated too, very useful for planning ahead a little and getting some idea of the powers available.<br />
<br />
They also have a guide on how to use the /bind and /macro system.  Very helpful.  The original is posted in the general forums at https://boards.cityofheroes.com/ubbthreads.php , worth reading.  You can change the control setup completely, even make it an eq clone if you like.<br />

Check out the Dev Digest thread there too for more game info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of these missions obey the &quot;Rule of 10&quot; (copyrighted by me!)  The rule states that everytime you have a mission to arrest a certain number of mobs, you will almost always be left with only one.  So, if you have to arrest 10, you'll find 9 mobs pretty easily and have a rough time with that last one.  ;)<br />

One of the task forces is supposed to do it, but it's not in yet.  The devs have hinted that it won't work exactly like it says in the guide (you complete the task force and get to respec.)  They do have the intention of allowing you to do it, but it sounds like they aren't planning on making it too easy.</div></div><hr />

I can't help but compare CoH taskforce missions to EQ's GoD sewers/vxed/tipt trials. They both take roughly the same amount of time to complete (5 hours+). However the difference is that CoH taskforce is a series of 10+ missions that brings you across several zones doing different things like patrolling the streets, hunting for clues, foiling their plan to take over the city, arresting their minions, finally cumulating with a fight with the arch villian himself. <br />
<br />
Compare that to vxed/tipt where me and my group spend 4+ hours of mind numbing slaughter as we made our way to the end of the zone only to be wiped out because we answered a riddle wrongly.. I'ld take CoH taskforce everyday over GoD trials.</div></div><hr />

Low load limit at the moment means more things to kill. )  I play a Mutant/defender and a tech/blaster mostly.  I have gotten my blaster to lvl 30 purely by using druid quad kiting tactics.  AoE snare and AoE damage except on a larger scale. 15 or so mobs in a group, 2 caltrops and 3 grenades means dead minions.  For those bosses and leiutenants --- Sniper rifle.  Blasters are very fragile and the hospital gets a lot of business. )          <br />
   My defender is purely doing mission and folling the story line.  My best encounter so far was meeting the arch villian  Dr. Vahzilok.  No way I could take him.  He was purple and we were the same lvl.  But just seeing him and finishing the mission gave 1000 exp and 500 influence.  Plus a DO enhancement.  Just an immensely fun game at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Respec was not in this last patch.  Just nerfage =P<br />

I made up a few toons to experiment with on Champion server since I have a friend also on that server.<br />
<br />
Love the character creation, I made a scrapper, defender and blaster to play around with.  I could spend hours designing characters :rolling:<br />

I don't miss EQ at all, and I'm getting about 2 hours of sleep more a night that I needed since I'm not raiding every night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, yes and no... The way it works now is once you take a task force you cannot take any other missions.  You must do the task force.  Your other contacts won't talk to you even to sell you stuff.  If you leave the task force, you cannot rejoin it.  You can log and come back and still be in the task force though.  The bug right now is if the leader goes offline for any reason, the task force will end after your current mission.<br />
<br />
So no, you don't have to do it all at one time.  You could do 2hrs of it one night, log (except for the leader who would have to remain online), and come back the next night and finish it out.  However, in the meantime, you wouldn't be able to do anything else until everyone logged back on to complete it except patrol.</div></div><hr />
