I have noticed that my weapon skill is not going up when in bear or cat form. Does this mean that I have to be in caster form to increase my weapon skill lvl? Also at what lvl should I get furor and naturalist in this feral build <br />

<br />
As tlbj6142 suggested I will probally be getting fff at 30, savage sury at 32, ILof the Pack at 42, OOC at 53 and mangle at 60-61.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Your &quot;feral combat skill&quot; automatically advances the full 5 levels each time you level up, ie your feral combat skill is always maxed.<br />
<br />
Therefore it's not crucial to level staff or mace skill, although it can be nice when you run out of other easy ways to ugprade your character.<br />
<br />
I would recommend going full feral to start with, and get Furor after you have mangle.  Then fill out the rest of your feral points, saving enough points for 5 in naturalist from 61-&gt;66, then Omen of Clarity at 67, and intensity at 68, 69, 70.<br />
