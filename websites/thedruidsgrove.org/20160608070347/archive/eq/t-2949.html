<br />
Just wondering, does Winged Death, Breath of Ro and Drones of Doom stack?  And does epic Wrath also stack on top of those three?<br />
<br />
Thx for any info?</div></div><hr />

You can stack:<br />
Wrath of Nature<br />
Winged Death<br />
Breath of Ro<br />
any 1 of Drifting Death/DoD/Creeping Crud/Stinging Swarm<br />
any 1 of Immolate/Flame Lick<br />
<br />
Also Sporecaller click, and possibly that something-sand proc.<br />
No idea about how the new 61+ DoTs fit in here.<br />
<br />
How it may be working now:<br />
I have read that as part of the DoT stacking patch (i.e. more than one druid can land DoT x on a mob), that you can now actually stack (by yourself) DoTs from the same line.  I.E. you can land Drifting Death and Drones of Doom on the same mob.  Realistically, though, this is rarely practical, except maybe from level 44-51 (after you get Drifting Death but before you get Breath of Ro, also assuming you are Evoc specced, otherwise BoR is almost useless.)<br />

<br />
one of each of the post 50th dot lines... ie Breath of Ro, Winged death<br />
<br />
One of each of pre 50th dot lines ... ie Immolate, Stinging Swarm<br />
<br />
One clickable .. Drones from arms<br />
<br />
And then an Epic.<br />
<br />
Constantly able to 4 way stack at 56th ... possible to do five with time but usually don't have the time to cast them all hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but you would rarely ever want to do this.  Only in the cases where the mob needed to die yesterday, or the world will end =)<br />
<br />
In the cases where you have the two common clickies (epic and ES arms/Velious bracer), the best way to XP is to keep multiple mobs rooted and rotting, using the free DoTs on all mobs, and casting the most efficient DoT(s) as mana allows.  The most efficient is either WD, or BoR for evoc spec'ed druids.  There's just no beating the efficiency of free damage, and the more mobs you can have lined up all cooking with free damage, the better.<br />
<br />
Last night I actually had 7 mobs rotting at once in ME, what a hoot (rack 'em, stack 'em, and pack 'em =)!  After the session was over, I parsed my log file to see how many mobs over the course of the session.  84 in 2:55, with an overall DPS of 60.  That's 60 DPS sustained over almost 3 hours!<br />
<br />
So, even though you CAN stack lots of DoTs, it's usually not worth casting the lower efficiency ones.<br />

I have to agree that it is not usually worth it but fun to do when bored out of your mind rotting things hehe.</div></div><hr />
