I used to try and just carry sets for feral and healing. I'm almost never in cat form during instances, so I figured my tanking gear will just make do. <br />
<br />
With the expansion, I have completely different sets for tanking (bear), grinding (cat), and healing. I also have other various goodies I tote around, like that hypnotist watch, Carrot on a Stick (which I probably should just bank), and my mark of the Argent Dawn (which should also go in the bank). <br />

I'm carrying around so much junk, I'm the Fred Sanford of Warcraft!</div></div><hr />

Soo much stuff to get...so many things to try. Isn't it just so exciting =D...<br />
<br />
imo druids and warriors and maybe a few other classes shuold get an ability to have more bag space. Druid for the amount of gear we need to be effective in more than one way and warriors and their numerous gear sets.</div></div><hr />

I'd assume that a guild wouldn't let a druid roll / spend dkp (do guilds still use dkp?) for their set piece if they already have one and another class doesn't have theirs yet.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'd like to get the healing and feral sets.</div></div><hr />

So much gear...world of gearcraft.</div></div><hr />

Make it so much easier<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-17-2007, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the thing is... the tier sets aren't dropped, they are bought from tokens from dungeons (don't know what they are but o well :) )<br />
<br />
Tier tokens 4 drop from Kharazan (Gloves and Helm), Gruul's Lair (Shoulders and Legs), and Magtheridon's Lair (chest).  <br />
<br />
Tier 5 tokens drop from The Eye and Serpentshrine Cavern. <br />
<br />
Each token can be used to buy one of three different sets (feral, balance, resto).  What I was referring to is that there there are three tokens, 1 for Mage / Warlock / Hunter, 1 for Pally / Rogue / Shaman, and 1 for Priest / Druid / Warrior.<br />
<br />
So if a chest token dropped, and you as a druid already had your t4 piece (for whatever you specialize in), it would be pretty greedy to roll for another one if either the warrior or priest didn't have it.  I can't see a guild letting a druid have 2 chest pieces when a priest or warrior still needs his 1st.  Thus the crazy endless grinding to get everyone their pieces.  I guess if guilds are still using dkp, whoever has the most can still get it.  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Staven</div><div class="date">03-18-2007, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">o, thanks, that makes it much clearer<br />
another thing is that most other classes only have 2 sets which aren't that different, why do druids have 3 when others only have 2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-19-2007, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because we have three viable forms / functions:  I.e. nuking / casting, tanking / dpsing, and healing.<br />
<br />
Warriors can either tank or dps.  Priests can either dps or heal.  Warlocks can specialize in either fire or shadow damage.  etc. etc. etc.</div></div><hr />
