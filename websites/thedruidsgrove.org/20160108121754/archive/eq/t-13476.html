<br />
I have just returned to Everquest after a long break. I stopped playing, um, *scratches head* at the OOW release and I have some questions if you have time :).<br />
<br />
Are Vxed, Yxtta and Qvic still viable options for solo exp? Have they been changed in any way since GoD release? I remember Vxed being pretty good back in the day.<br />
<br />
The game looks to have changed a lot. How is the druid class these days? Have we been buffed up/nerfed? <br />
<br />
I have all the expansions now and will be looking to get lvl 70 eventually :p. I'm hoping to get cracking with some DoDH missions this weekend but am looking for somewhere to solo during the week when my playtime is less. Noble's Causeway looks interesting though it seems to be a popular place for soloers of all classes.<br />
<br />
Are there any other zones I could solo in? I usually root/rot or quad. I've done PoFire to death and would like to try something new.<br />
<br />
My gear is in my magelo below if needed. I'm also in a bit of a quandry as to what AA's to get next. I notice a lot of them are restricted by level. Any advice on AA's would help too, my mind is spinning and I feel like I have a lot of information to catch up on!<br />
<br />
Your advice and help is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Welcome back!  I remember you from days of old :)<br />
<br />
I'll leave the advice to the more experienced, since I'm a pretty casual player myself, and you're probably still ahead of where I am now ;)<br />

Healing and DPS have increased since you left prior to Omens. This is esp true with the spell revamp eariler this year and the addition of new spells such as Skin of the Reptile.<br />

Undershore, Stoneroot Falls, The Hive, Relic, Ruins of Takish-Hiz, to name a few.</div></div><hr />

Those are tricky and I think most of them summon?  I group 5x more than solo, therefore others would have better grasp of it.  I have solo'd orcs and shiliskins in Undershore and Stoneroot while in between DoDH missions.  Real good spot for kiting is at the Drachnid Candle mission.  During the double aaxp weekend we had a couple months back, I spent alot of time kiting in the Hive near the zone in from Stoneroot.  In a nutshell; it rocked.<br />
<br />
You want Reptile Skin asap.  It's a level 68 DoDH spell, 4 or 5 missions for it.  Will be great for you and/or group members.  While working on those missions for the 68, 69, and 70 spells you could also pickup nice armor upgrades which appears mostly PoP/PoTime.  When get groups together, work on DoN expansion factions and missions.  Nice augments you can buy from the merchants and 100% weight reduction bags, but most importantly is the spell Serpent Vines; a very difficult to resist snare.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte is a good aa, just ensure you train it through utilizing the correct specialization ;)  Finish up Spirit of the Grove and also train Resplendent cure; both are valuable in group, alone, and raids.  Also, Call of the Wild and Shared Camoflauge are standard AA's to have when you hit level 70 and quite useful.</div></div><hr />
