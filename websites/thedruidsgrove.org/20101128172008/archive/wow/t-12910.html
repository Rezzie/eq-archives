<br />
i love the new graphics - they are sooo sharp and clear. its like playing in HD ?<br />
i love the mounts gone from bags<br />
i love the new currency tab<br />
i love the fact u can see the events calendar in game now<br />
<br />
<br />
i dont love the fact i just got kicked and it says World Server Down ;) <br />
i dont love the early people who have levelled inscription high already in 1 hr ?? charging 500g + for druid glyphs !</div></div><hr />

But yeah, how'd they do that so fast?<br />
 <br />
HDWoW &lt;3. <br />
Working on achievements and wasting countless hours of my time &lt;3. <br />
New talents &lt;3<br />
Everythign happening so much faster than it ever did cause of loldps &lt;3<br />
Healers not being able to keep up with the loldps, so no one healing anymore in bg's &lt;/3</div></div><hr />

<br />
one thing i dont like at all<br />
<br />
* the fact so many achievements i've done in the past near 4 years are listed as not achieved :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then, I had to go to work.<br />
<br />
So......the only thing I've enjoyed so far about 3.0 is reading your comments!  :p <br />
<br />
Except the part about people having already power leveled their Inscribing.  <br />
<br />
That part?  Makes me angry.  Really angry.  :curse:</div></div><hr />

<br />
World Server has been up and down like the proverbial tart's knickers !  i get kicked off every 10 mins atm i reckon.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Dumped every single point I had for my priest into shadow though, and wow :)  <br />
 <br />
On a side note - I was keeping her at 69 to grind out some honor so that I could have some decent gear before getting beat down by warglaive rogues in the 70's bg's.  I logged in on her to try out her new shadow talents in the bg's, and i was lv 69 in the 70 bg's!!!  wtf?!  when did that happen?  Talk about getting 2 shotted (with my amazing 5k hp and 800 armor).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically you just mill herbs, make inks, buy new stuff, make glyphs or scrolls, get to a new level, mill all those herbs, make the new inks, buy stuff, make new glyphs etc.<br />
<br />
The herb market is a joke right now.  I saw goldthorn for 100g a stack last night.  Peacebloom for 15g a stack.  Its that first day or two of leveling.  I personally made tons of extra stuff that I'm just giving to all my alts as well as setting it in our guild bank for people to use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-15-2008, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i better check herb prices and sell some fast !<br />
<br />
just seen a guy in a big guild advertise is inscription at 300 !! <br />
<br />
i also love <br />
<br />
* the fact u now can link your profession and everyone can see what you can make and the mats needed !<br />
* and using pots in forms !<br />
* and no longer coming out of feral form to use the fel syphon in the HFP daily q !<br />
* using bandages in forms ! :)</div></div><hr />

This is the biggest most fun change they made.  You almost never have to leave form.  Its great.</div></div><hr />

LOL - I have to resist the urge to look over my shoulder to make sure Durn isn't lurking behind me every time I take a reading.  :grin:</div></div><hr />

Pff, with PotP and the other abilities, tanking got a LOT nicer if you spec for it in 3.0.  The numbers just aren't as flashy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavin</div><div class="date">10-21-2008, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lost 8K armor off of my tanking gear, but I don't mind trading that for all of the fixes and buff we got.<br />
<br />
I love the emergency buttons we now have when tanking- <br />
Survival Instincts<br />
Frenzied Regeneration<br />
Barkskin castable in bear<br />
Pots useable in bear<br />
Natures Grasp useable indoors (minor upgrade)<br />
<br />
I like PotP alot.  Not sure if I love it yet.  My armor was just under 30K before the patch.  I havent played enough to see if things balance out yet.<br />
<br />
I love Swipe having no target limit.<br />
I love Entangling Roots indoors (although I completely forgot to use on the third boss fight in H Magister Terrace!)<br />
I love cat dps.  My dps went up considerably.<br />
<br />
Now if I can only figure out how to fit everything on my bear and cat bars...</div></div><hr />

<br />
definitely this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mavin</div><div class="date">10-21-2008, 01:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For bear I put most of the emergency stuff on a macro- <br />
Survival Instincts, Frenzied Regen, and my two trinkents (Badge of Tenacity and Moroes Pocket Watch).  Barkskin is on the global cooldown so I might put that in the macro too as a cast sequence.  I am not sure what to do with Challenging Roar as I don't use it that often.<br />
<br />
For Cat I combined pounce and maim with a macro depending on if I am stealthed or not.  I still dont have room ravage, cower and dash.</div></div><hr />
