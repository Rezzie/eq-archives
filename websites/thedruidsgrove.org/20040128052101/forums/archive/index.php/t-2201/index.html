<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kalest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been exploring some spots trying to find advice on where to go at lvl 55 as a druid. Just to give idea of equip, I have epic and thurg armor. Anyways where would be a good place to solo? I have tried Akehva and that was alot of caster adds from no where, have a problem with dying in ME. Seems the only luck has been at the giant fort in BW. IF anyone has any advice this slow lvl'ing druid could use it would be very much appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks For hearing me :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You could try hunting animals in Western Wastes if your dragon faction is ok.  I always enjoyed that.  Nice xp too, and relaxing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it's open Raptor island in TD.  I started quadding them at 56 but in my down time between quads I'd root rot them.  Decent xp.  Just call raptor camp check before you head all the way across zone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AverionTriesAgain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">At lvl 55 i was charming in PoN, went from 55 to 58 in a maybe 10 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zukasil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 55 you should try soloing in a PoP zone...... i suggest either charming ravens in PoN or heading over to PoD and charming rats. Many good guides around the site on strategies for charming.. GL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Accretion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Charming in ME can also be fun.  I haven't done much there since The Great Charm Nerf, but the wolves make great CoK pets and you can churn through Toilers, Xis and even some lower Gorangas there pretty well.  The key is finding a spot with few wanderers that you can pull to.  <br />

<br />
Far?<br />
<br />
It's right there.<br />
<br />
Gonna have Egress loaded anyways.  <br />
Use it.<br />
Succor spot is like 30 seconds from the raptors.<br />
<br />
And charm them, it's more efficient.  And safer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kalest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive tried the PoP zones and well, im very bad at charm kiting, I'll keep giving it a try and also will try raptors. Ive marked of several zones off my list of too-try s as well. THe advice is appreciated and any more is always great. Thanks for being good people :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Willie0782</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yea  POD is nice if u are carefully pullin ...best if u charm pesilent rats cause they hit for around 290 and u repulse ur targeet so save ur pet from beating...but charms will break fast sometimes so stay alert. i always pull from where grimor be at  if u fear (Repulse Animal) near that rock he will follow a safe trail  along the wall but make sure theres no rats around that area or ull get agro, unless u can handle the situation....and annul magic pet before he dies more xp if u uncharm him hehe <br />
