<br />
On what I've read so far - and I'll admit, I've been kind of speed reading ( I'm at work :shuffle: ) so I may have missed something - but I can see no benefit to NOT healing in Tree form.<br />
<br />
I see all these talent trees with points in Furor to assist us with the mana cost of Shapeshifting but with all the bonuses we get while healing in tree form, why would we ever shift out of it?<br />
<br />
I must have missed something obvious.<br />
<br />
I'd like to add too that I'm loving the changes.  Except 1 LB on 1 target only?  That's gonna mess me right up.</div></div><hr />

Confirmed.<br />
<br />
To test the Tree Form bonuses, after training last night, I shifted into a tree and started throwing heals on myself.<br />
<br />
I was quite impressed with the results.<br />
<br />
Although I won't be casting HT (without Nature's Swiftness) during a very limited 30 seconds, I will still be a very happy tree every 3 minutes or so.</div></div><hr />
