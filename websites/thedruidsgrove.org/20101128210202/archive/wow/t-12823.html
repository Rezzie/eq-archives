With Survival of the Fittest talent, you need 415 defense rating to reach uncrittable status.  Druids will not be immune to crushing blows but because of the insane armor + hp pool we can usually soak them up.  In liu of 415 defense, you can pad it with resilience.  I think it's 109 resilience with the base of 350 defense for uncrittable.  <br />
<br />
I think some good stats for starter tanking are somewhere around 24,000 armor, 26% dodge, maybe around 13-14k hp in bear.  <br />
<br />
http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/04/15/shifting-perspectives-gearing-your-bear-tank-from-70-to-karazha/  This is a great gear guide.  =) <br />
<br />
DPS is something I'm not as researched in but...I'm pretty sure for PvE DPS, stack agility/crit/strength or AP.  Personally for PvP DPS lately I've been sort of leaning away from crit and more towards solid attack power because resilience kills crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Armour / Stam / Def / Res / Crit / Dodge<br />
<br />
i assume your still running some normal instances and looking ahead to heroics and/or Kara ?<br />
<br />
most important start is to get uncrittable as Sy mentions above. and yeah that link is a great guide as to whats available and how to get it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nukleik</div><div class="date">09-09-2008, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">about the uncrittable cap, to reach it you need in total 2.6% from def and resilience.  When you mouseover the DEF or RES stat on your cahracter sheet, a poup will tell you the chance reduction of being critically hit. Just add the 2 numers and it must be at least 2.6%<br />
<br />
Once you reach that, just stack Sta and Agi for mitigation once you've reach the numbers from the above post, you can begin to stack str or AP for better threat generation.<br />
<br />
Being healable is good but not losing aggro and giving the chance to the dps to open the machine will be, in the long run, easier on the healers :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The subject of basic bear stats has been adequately covered already by the other druids.<br />
<br />
For cat druids, at level 70 early raiding you should get the best feral weapon you can find, and then stack lots of agility.  It is also worth starting to build up a little hit rating, in preparation for later raid content such as SSC and TK - when you start running those sorts of instances you will really want to have 142 hit rating as this will dramatically increase your damage output and make your rotations flow smoother.<br />
