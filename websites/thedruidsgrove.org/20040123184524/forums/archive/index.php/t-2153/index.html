<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so now I have access to PoV much sooner than I thought I would due to the recent patch.  Reading up on the plane I decided I'd like to try root/dotting golems, not only do they sound like good exp but I could use the metallic liquid since I'm working up my pottery.  What I haven't been able to find is a description of what people consider camps in this zone.  On my first exploration of the zone someone called out a camp check and the responses were:<br />

[Thu Jun 12 10:12:42 2003] Moggallana says out of character, 'BC'<br />
[Thu Jun 12 10:12:42 2003] Bladeslasher says out of character, 'ew'<br />
[Thu Jun 12 10:12:44 2003] Dandre says out of character, 'FC'<br />
[Thu Jun 12 10:12:44 2003] Ekilam says out of character, 'ne'[/quote]<br />
<br />
Could someone enlighten me on where these camps are located, and if there are any you know of that were not called out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ww = west wall (also left castle)<br />
ew = east wall (also right castle)<br />
bc = back caves (also inner caves) &lt;--best exp<br />
fc = front caves (also outer caves)<br />
ne = northeast (along zone edge, NE corner of zone)<br />
<br />
you might also see groups at the AD door, whatever that's called on your server - though groups at WW, EW, NE, and the door make killing in the desert a bit slow~<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also a lot of mobs noone ever seems to kill.  They aren't as good exp as the above camps, but are certainly viable.  The big human-looking soldiers of Marr are tough but rewarding.  There are also unaggro frogs and larvae.  And don't forget the undead.. This is all still quite fun and all still better exp than tier 1 mobs~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mendan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, thanks so much, that was very informative.  Are there faction hits to worry about when killing anything in the zone, specifically the soldiers you mentioned?  And I know there are snare immune mobs around, but are there any summoners I need to avoid when solo?</div></div><hr />
