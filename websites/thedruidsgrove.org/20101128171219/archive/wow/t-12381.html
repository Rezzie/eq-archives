<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">killinwookie</div><div class="date">02-09-2008, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To anyone in game atm and paying attention to forums, a group of us have been observing 3 different characters with odd behavior outside of Shadow Labs. One is a lv 66 NE Rogue named Bandindios who can double jump and instantly go from ground to near ceilling height in a split second. I followed him from slabs to Alerigan Stronghold and when he got to the inn on his mount he jumped through the doorway and dissapeard and was told at sametime over vent that he just appeared in front of Slabs entrance. Also a recently hacked Kitokys being used for this belonging to Metraton who was moved to Eldra' Thalas by shear coincidence spotted by someone in group on a toon on that server in SW.<br />
<br />
Shot of him sitting down regaining his health a few hundred feet in the air and if you look to the left underneath my minimap you'll see Akheena the 70 tier 6 rogue who came back to attack me flew up and spotted the 66 there eating. Also notice how Kitokys keeps logging on and off<br />
The other is a lvl 70 NE Warrior(either Nevarios or Navarios can't remember) with nothing but a guild tabbard, a mining pick and a thrown weapon constantly running in and out of shadow labs every 5 mins sometimes with near death stats but mostly 100% hp and hearths out every once in a while logs off and then on appears in fron instantly and goes back in obviously no cap on how many times he can run in. Took a long time but got him to give an email addy and asking for ours in return. He mentioned a website bygamer.com as being where he works i suggest not visiting this site as it may be a straight keylogger injector of some sort. Eventually ignored that player and started whispering myself and another. Odd and hard to understand maybe foreign hacker.<br />
<br />
Seems he can jump from realm to realm through certain glitched spots around Terrokar. Anyway this dude soloing Slabs with a pick and no armor. He may still be there if you wanna see just stand outside the Slabs portal entrance and wait you'll see multiple toons hearthing, coming in and out, stealthing and waiting running back in, soloing a flagged tier6 horde rogue who was afk at repair dude with his fists taking 1% per hit kinda neart impossible with a lvl 66 in full greens. Obviously using stat changer software or just a very smart hacker making a killing hacking accounts and exploiting Slabs. I think the flagged tier 6 rogue was also a hacked toon of his. This NE rogue used vanish 3 time in a row no CD.<br />
<br />
Anyway put a very interesting stop to our Slabs run.=P<br />
He and all his toons having been reported my multiple players wouldn't be surprised if he is behind many other account hacks. Tried tracking the ip address of said hacker and kept getting a re-route impossible to breakthrough.<br />
<br />
Response from GM missed but here's what he said:<br />

Petition: I spotted odd behavior from 3 characters outside Shadow Labrynth 1 rogue Bandindos who can double jump and stay at 100% energy and instantly go from ground to enviroment ceilling, a 70 warrior with no armor and a mining pick who seems to be soloing SL and Kytokys a recently hacked account in my guild seemingly being used to do the same. The rogue can blind 3 times in a row also i followed him from labs all the way to Alerigan Stronghold and dissapeared in doorway of inn.<br />
