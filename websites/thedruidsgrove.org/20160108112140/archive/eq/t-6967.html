In a relationship, and significant other plays MMO's with me.  <br />
<br />
didn't have their spouses vote also, we can kind of count that as double.<br />
<br />
So as of this time there are 11 people that voted in that category so you can pretty much count that as 22 people.<br />
<br />
I think MMO's need to start focusing their attention on couples playing. :)<br />
<br />
Which was the main purpose of this poll. I've been playing MMOs for getting close to ten years now, dating back to those glorious muds, and various text games, and lately I've found that more couples are finding homes in MMOs. So much that to me it seems that they are starting to dominate the social MMOs that I've played lately.</div></div><hr />

He is married to my cleric, although she is all but retired. Our guild also has a large amount of married couples in it. The couple that plays together, stays together. hehe!<br />

We play EQ and Lineage 2 currently, plus we lan as much as we can together too. We have 2 small kids and it's just something we both like to do. We don't have much by the way of money, so playing MMO's at home actually saves our entertainment dollar.</div></div><hr />
