One thing to remember is to ensure that your mailbox is not full before using these types of emails. Gmail accounts seems to work just fine.<br />
 <br />
1.) Make sure when you register you use a valid email since we send you a confirmation email. Reason we request a working email is to keep the spam off the boards from our friendly board spammers. <br />
 <br />
2.) Make sure the account your sending the confirmation email to is actual working! - Test it.<br />
 <br />
3.) Here at the Grove we do not send email other then from the administrator and from the controls that you set in your Control Panel, or if you get into trouble.. IE: Break the rules!<br />
 <br />
If you have created an account, please send us your user name that you created for the Grove to admin@thedruidsgrove.org and make sure you list the email that you signed up with and we will go into the system and manual correct your account.</div></div><hr />

Hotmail and Yahoo are both notorious for that!</div></div><hr />

This email is ONLY GOOD FOR 24 HOURS. If you have past the 24 hour mark please email us at admin@thedruidsgrove.org.<br />

If you do not get a response from admin@thedruidsgrove.org, please email me directly at rahjeir@thedruidsgrove.org</div></div><hr />
