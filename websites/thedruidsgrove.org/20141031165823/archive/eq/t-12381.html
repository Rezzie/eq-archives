<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaryn</div><div class="date">10-17-2005, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had already completed the druid epic before I transfered servers (when you had to move naked) so I lost my epic...I just decided to do it again, and over the weekend got up to Venril Sathir.  My druid is 65, I have a 70 cleric, a 65 bard and a 55 warrior.  My buddy also has a few characters of around the same levels and we each have a couple of computers, so most likely the two of us should be able to complete the rest of my epic 1.0 (again), but the question is,&quot; Is it worth it?&quot;  The stats aren't the greatest in this day and age.<br />
 <br />
I used to be in the top guild on Vallon Zek (Defiant) and then Triton on Povar before taking a year off.  I say this because I'm not currently guilded and am not a powergamer like I used to be (funny how women will do that to you) so my second question is, &quot;How much of Epic 1.5/2.0 can be done without a large guild?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you do a lot of root/rotting, solo-exp, i'd say go for it. Otherwise there's no need to do the 1.0 any more. there is a lot better for a lot less effort. do the 1.0 bypass quest for the 1.5 epic.<br />
<br />
1.5 can be done without large guild.  you could finish 1.5 assuming you have quality gear on a small amount of peeps;like time-ikky-RS, but before txevu/tacvi.  very few encounters need a 'raid' of 3-4 groups.</div></div><hr />

It's not a hard quest, time is the only real problem.  Epic 1.0s are antiques and the druid one is remarkably common, but it's something I would call a part of the druid tradition to have around.  Kinda like the magician and shadowknight 1.0s, completely outdated, but something of a status symbol to have (I've only ever seen 1 shadowknight epic 1.0 on a player, I can count on just my fingers the number of people I've seen with mage 1.0s).</div></div><hr />

As such, it was MUCH easier for me to complete the 1.0 than to do the side quest.  Now that the information is also out there and much more commonly known, I am not sure how hard the sidequest is, but that is another consideration if wanting to get it simply to allow you then to get the 1.5/2.0</div></div><hr />
