<br />
I've recently specced to Retor from full Feral.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is my gear, please, if there are any tips of improvements regarding my gear/talents/enchants/gems whatever, feel free to comment. - I'd rather not buy any crafted stuff for lack of a budget, and i HATE pvp, so i hope Heroics/Reps/5-men/a bit of kara can get me on the right track, thanks.<br />

Hello new druid!  :D<br />
<br />
Welcome to our Druid's Grove ^_^<br />
<br />
Well, you are missing 35 healing on gloves.. (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=33999) That's quite an expensive enchant though so maybe you wish to wait for a better item to come along, since as you say money is a factor right now..<br />
<br />
Perhaps some friendly leaf druids will have some more advice for you :&gt;<br />

<br />
But i'm sure there are other stuff i can improve from heroics and such?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also i have a problem with my Solo DPS gear, it's rather bad.<br />
<br />
I'm standing on about 640 Spell Damage and 15% spell criti right now, I wonder if it's worth buying all those different rep leather rewards for pure spell damage or ...?<br />

i'd be tempted to say hang fire until Wrath as the new gear you'll get from drops / early quests could quite easily be better the the rep purchasable ones?</div></div><hr />

WOTLK is exactly the reason i SHOULD be getting better DPS gear , so questing in the new zones will be a bit easier 'tll i grab the new green gear that'll out-perform all those epics :(</div></div><hr />

This.<br />

If you have some easily attainable items, go for them, but otherwise, kinda like when BC came out, &quot;green is the new purple&quot; for anyone that isn't in T6 &amp; Sunwell gear.</div></div><hr />

The only reason I kept some of it was for tanking purposes and that is looking kind of pointless at this point since they are nerfing our armor on the leather items now.</div></div><hr />

Can't see ur resto gear cause ur logged in dps stuff.  <br />
 <br />
Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about grinding crazy new gear for your druid.  Lots of crazy new stuff coming out in a month.</div></div><hr />

not me<br />
<br />
i'll never go resto.<br />
<br />
yuck.<br />
<br />
i spent the whole of MC/BWL and AQ40 healing in feral spec.<br />
<br />
/roar.<br />
<br />
now if people want me to heal i just say find a carebear ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-06-2008, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've spent a decent amount of time as both feral and resto (never played boomkin).  At this point, I am really enjoying being resto again on my druid (even though after countless days of /played time in MC/BWL/AQ I swore I never would go resto again...).  <br />
 <br />
I suppose that its cause I've spent so much time recently as dps in both pvp and pve on my warlock, and done quite a bit of melee dps on my warrior in pvp, and tanked quite a bit on him in pve.  Healing as a tree is a refreshing change of pace actually.  Thats my favorite part about my druid - as soon as one aspect gets repetitive / boring, I can just switch and do something else for a mere 50g :)<br />
 <br />
I will be going back to feral and tanking my way up to 80 when lich comes out.  Definitley feral at heart.  Not sure about my 80 spec... figure I'll play it by ear when I get there.</div></div><hr />
