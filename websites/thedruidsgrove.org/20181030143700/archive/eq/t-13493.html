If you set the options correct you should still see epics.  Having &quot;On For&quot; PCs show particles for epics etc.  The auras are considered NPCs or something like that.  They are actually an invisible NPC following us all around I believe, because they were causing targetting issues in Beta til devs got it fixed.  You can also see this while you're running with selos or horse, you can outrun your aura, watch it flash off/on in your short duration window.</div></div><hr />

I use Tempest Wind alot and it hasn't been working correct since PoR launched... ie. no rains for damage at all upon cast or just the first wave and no others hit.</div></div><hr />

I suspect you're correct that the aura's are absorbing waves of rains.  We're checking into it and will get it fixed.<br />

I'd like to turn off Aura Particles, but I like to see Enemy NPC's casting spells.  Especially healers so I know to stun when I see Blue Particles coming from their hands.<br />

Do these fall under the same setting?</div></div><hr />

But I seem to remember reading something about Particles getting their own filter in the patch last week?  Or was it something else I'm thinking of.</div></div><hr />
