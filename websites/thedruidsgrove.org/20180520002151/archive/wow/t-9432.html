i was lucky enough to get the staff from that everliveing elemental in wc, its called living root it does around 50 to 80 damage every hit.(atleast somewre between there)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends on the guild you join, and how they decide to distribute loot. Some guilds you don't have to roll at all, it will be merit(DKP) based. Some you will have to roll. Some it will just be assigned.<br />
<br />
If its a pickup raid that somehow manages to kill her, you better believe you'll be rolling against everyone and their brother.</div></div><hr />

DPS=Damage Per Second<br />
Proc=An ability of a weapon that triggers when you hit someone (ie. the &quot;Chance on hit: Hurls a fiery ball that causes 273 to 333 Fire damage and an additional 75 damage over 10 sec&quot; that comes on that hand.)<br />
<br />
Also, the stats on that weapon are alright if you're a feral druid that plans on tanking a lot, but I'm sure there are weapons of equal stat quality (with respect to Stam and Strenth) that wouldn't cost you near as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to let you know Amberseal Keeper drops from Kazzak not from Onyxia.  Kazzak is a little bit different since he's a contested mob it really depends on your server as to if pick ups would even try to attempt him.  Zul has had some raids that might qualify as pick ups kill Kazzak but it's generally a it's 3 am and none of the guilds that normally kill him have more than 5 people on so lets organize a force from the top guilds and kill him before alliance does (not technically pick up since there is no shout in Org looking for more members).  Generally it's either my guild or rarely one of 2 others on Zul that take him down.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starfire</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP = fighting mobs and other players from the opposing faction.  You can go into any alliance city  as a horde player and attack any person you see.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE = fighting mobs and other players as well, but to fight opposing faction outside of Battlegrounds, you have to flag yourself with /pvp and then either kill gaurds and NPC's or wait until they flag themselves to fight you also.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes vary.  Choose what fits you best!  For a beginner,  I suggest warrior or rogue.  Easy to use, lots of damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nytewalker</div><div class="date">10-11-2005, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP = Player V Player<br />
<br />
PvE = Player V Environment (aka Normal)<br />
<br />
The way I understand it, if you walk into contested lands, or the opposing side's lands on a PVP server, you are flagged PvP. That means that you are able to be attacked. You can't attack someone from the opposing city until they flag themselves by attacking you, or healing someone you are in combat with, etc. So you couldn't sneak in and gank someone in their own city unless they were already PvP flagged. You could however, send in a really low level mage as bait, wait in stealth, then when someone attacks the mage, claw the heck out of them switch to bear, stun them, switch to caster MF them and then back to bear to pound on them until they call for help ;)<br />

<br />
On the screenshots:  You simply hit the &quot;Print Screen&quot; button on your keyboard.  I forget where it puts them though.  Play around with your WoW folder to find them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rockwell</div><div class="date">10-14-2005, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Screenshots are stored in a folder in wow called Screenshots... the annoying bit is they're saved as .tga files.  You'll need ACDsee or another program that can open'm.  Window's Media Player will actually show the pic' but they're always upside down.<br />
<br />
As for slightly underhanded PvP on a PvE, for the opening of the Faire in Goldshire I found a neat tatic.  Attack a random guard on the edge of town, lowbies in town always get the idea of helping the guard... wait till a couple attack ya, then travel form outta there.  Once your away, stealth and head back to town... PVP flag's are contagious...  <br />
<br />
Now for Synergy'  here's some SS's I posted to my guild forum of my day in Goldshire (this is from the first faire two months ago).<br />
