<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone use this spell successfully there?  I was in Takish last night but only ended up trying it at the end when we were running out of time.  I tried it on one (yes summoned) mob only and the spell cast but then said this mob could not be banished or whatever.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if it's a zone wide thing or just that particular mob type. (like some are immune to snare/root/stun etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Glynna1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Works very welll on the stone mobs, and the sandelves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rosellia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does anyone know if a banished mob counts as a kill in the kill missions? I've heard banished mobs don't leave a corpse, so not planning on trying it in a collect mission.<br />
<br />
Might work well regular mobs in assasinate and rescue missions tho.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm surprised it works at all, doesn't it have a low level limit (somewhere around 53)?  What level adventures have people been using banishment on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kobara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesnt seem worth the effort to me since it costs so much per cast if I recall my Star Ruby costs. Much easier to just kill them the natural way since they all die in 15 seconds or less the old fashioned way.. plus every corpse is one more shot at a Augmentation item or resllable that is lost when/if a Banishment lands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">on mdk mission, worked on nothing.<br />
<br />
there are some times when you might wanna use this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Destroy summoned is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Glynna1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sorry I meant destroy summoned. I don't know if the banished spell works on the level of mobs in LDoN (i.e. if you are 65 and fighting dark blue mobs) as there is a level restriction on it I believe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wandazula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">what exactly is this spell useful for again?  heheh.<br />
<br />
OH well.  I wouldn't want to use it a lot there but say you pull the boss mob and adds come, the mission is just to kill the boss, if you don't have an enchanter you could banish them.  *that* would be useful.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Palarran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In any case, Destroy Summoned is a wonderful nuke in Takish, especially if you have no real reason to cast Hand of Ro.  I haven't had a single resist yet (it checks magic -100, same as our magic-based dots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scirocco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why cast destroy summoned?  Damage is too low for my tastes, and efficiency shouldn't really be a problem.   I tried it for half of a slaughter adventure, and WF the other half.  The kill rate for the group was faster when I was using WF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ArienneDileas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I cast one of the destroy summoned spells once.  Forget what level, but it was on Drelzina's pet in Charsis.  Heck!  I figured for a star ruby it should have actually destroyed the summoned pet.  Did a little damage, but not NEAR what I had expected.  That was the last time I used that spell line  :/ I guess at 65 a star ruby is not as costly a spell as it once was, but probably just as pointless.  I think a most druids have narrowed their functioning spell list considerably over time.  It's a shame really.  There's so much potential if the spells actually did what they first appeared to be.<br />
<br />
I really love my druid, but there is so much that could be improved on existing spells and abilities that sometimes it's almost frustrating  :( <br />
<br />
Anyway, I find keeping ice and fire both memmed gives you something that lands in all the LDoN dungeons.  No need to waste a star ruby.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Destroy summoned does not consume a star ruby. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Destroyed Summoned is an almost no-resist nuke against summoned mobs.  It does not consume a star ruby.<br />
<br />
Banishment consumes a star ruby and completely disintigrates a mob without leaving any corpse and without giving any xp.<br />
<br />
That said, does banishing a mob in Tak count as a kill for purposes of counting the number of kills in a Kill X Mob adventure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>kineada</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Depending on gear and spec, summer's flame can be better manawise.  I ALWAYS cast Hand of Ro so I never get fire nuke resists.  I also have elemental gloves, a fire nuke focus and am evoc spec'd.  This pretty much makes summer's flame my nuke of choice for most encounters.<br />
<br />
Without hand, destroy summoned is by far the best nuke to use in Takhis.<br />
<br />
Destroy Summoned:<br />
1200 damage for 300 mana (4:1)<br />
-100 MR resist check<br />
focused:<br />
1410 average damage for 278 average mana (5.07:1)<br />
Wrath of Druzzil + Preservation of Xegony<br />
<br />
Summer's Flame:<br />
1400 damage for 355 mana (3.94:1)<br />
Base FR resist check<br />
1645 average damage for 328 average mana (5.01:1)<br />
Wrath of Ro + Preservation of Xegony<br />
<br />
Please note that the only reason I prefer Summer's Flame is that I don't have a magic damage focus and I like to cast hand of ro (add 165 mana to 328 and summer's flame becomes 3.34:1).<br />
<br />
Oh ... I don't cast hand of ro for the FR debuff, I cast it for the ATK debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>TeriMoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like to use destroy summoned in Takish because:<br />
<br />
1.  I don't have to debuff<br />
2.  I don't get resists<br />
<br />
therefore I can cast more.  Since mana isn't an issue, its just kind of fun.  I really hate using WF, the cast time is so slow.  I don't have a good focus item yet for detrimental spell haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Teaamilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;I'm wondering if it's a zone wide thing or just that particular mob type.[/quote] <br />
<br />
I would bet it's LDoN overall. While I haven't tried this out personally, my cleric hubby tried to banish undead (undead version of Banishment, uses star ruby also).  On different undead in different zones he got the same message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Batou062671</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Banishment not being able to effect mobs may have to do with their level.  If they are over a certian level the spell can not get rid of them and gives you that message.  Most likely the adventures you were on would be over that level (since I think it's like 45 or 50ish)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Glynna1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Finally found a use for my boots. The effect works with Destroy Summoned. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>patofnaud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow talk about a thread where folks really need to Read, Comprehend, Post.<br />
<br />
The person said 'banish' in first post then corrected and said 'destroy' yet folks still go on about how banish is too expensive and you chance destroying loot, etc...<br />
<br />
Destroy Summoned folks.. No Star Ruby, no poofing corpse, very good mana to damage ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sildan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Destroy Summoned is the win in Tak!!<br />
<br />
Yes Winters frost does more damage<br />
Yes Summers Flame is cheap with gloves<br />
NO, Destroy summoned DOES NOT MISS!!<br />
<br />
I'll repeat that.<br />
Destroy Summoned DOES NOT MISS!!<br />

Love this spell,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Racmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I love destroy summon for these reasons<br />
<br />
1) Mana efficient<br />
2) NO RESISTS<br />
3) I do NOT cast Hand of Ro, nor do I see a need to on slowed mobs<br />
4) cast time is faster since I'm also usually the main healer, I don't want to be tied up in a long spell.<br />
5) Fire is resisted a good bit in Takish.<br />
<br />
I don't understand the debuffing thing in LDon.  The mob is almost dead after the second nuke.  I understand debuffing if it's going to be a long fight, but why on short fights?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I usually debuff on a lot of fights.  Most short ones especially.  Because of the short sweet nature of LDoN events, if theres a wizard, sub-par warrior or mana bound cleric, I debuff with Ro's.<br />
<br />
Why, when the mobs dead in two nukes?  To ensure the mob is dead in two nukes, and not in three due to a resist.<br />
<br />
It's easy, its fun. (as in short fights you land it early and get aggro)  It's a non damaging spell that keeps the mob off the chanter when mezz breaks.<br />
<br />
The only time I don't debuff in LDoN is when I get the lucky group of a guild cleric, warrior, a bard and and two rogues.  Was scary how fast stuff died, I only got in one nuke per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aracnoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Destroy Summoned rules especially with ID IV, MP IV, Rizlona's and NO RESIST, partial or otherwise.  Woot !!<br />
<br />
Btw, has anyone checked maximum nukage damage for this spell?<br />
<br />
Did I say, NO RESIST !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Wildaiena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've used destroy summoned. Nice spell, no resists, fast cast, didn't even realize it was MR based hehe, and it's probably just my imagination but I seem to get a lot of crits with it. Up to 2600-2700ish so far, so if its MR based then my steel shim is helping.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thicket Tundrabog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's taken me awhile, but I think I've finally optimized my Destroy Summoned/Hand of Ro/Summer's Flame strategy.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the most efficient spell strategy is,<br />
<br />
Use Destroy Summoned in Takish. Only the whirlwind and tiny beetle-thingys are not summoned.  I've never had it resisted. As such it's the most mana efficient.<br />
<br />
For non-summoned mobs, use Hand of Ro/Summer's Flame in combination if you can get in at least two spells before the mob is dead. Hand of Ro is an AC and Attack debuff as well as a fire debuff. Your tanks will give more damage and take less damage when you use Hand of Ro. Let other nukers know you use Hand of Ro so that they can use fire based nukes.<br />
<br />
If you are in an uber-group and can only get one spell in before mob is dead, then use Summer's Flame.<br />
<br />
This strategy needs to be adjusted if you are also snaring and healing.<br />
<br />
Thicket</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Use Destroy Summoned in Takish. Only the whirlwind and tiny beetle-thingys are not summoned. I've never had it resisted. As such it's the most mana efficient.<br />
<br />
Just a small correction - the tree (malevolent and petrified) are also not summoned. I'm not sure about the frogs offhand, but the trees definitely are not (these aren't the hollow trees I'm talking about, of course).<br />
<br />
My own strategy has been to hit the second and third mobs (if we have 3 in camp, which is not at unusual) with Hand of Ro but often not the one that is currently being killed. Typically I can start nuking the second mob right away after debuffing (but my main is a paladin and can maintain aggro if my druid does that ;)).</div></div><hr />
