I just hit level 50 and am finally starting to make some money.  Been soloing Dulak's Harbor.  There are some nice rare gem drops there.  :)<br />
<br />
Anyhow, back to the game.  :)<br />

I should be able to start my first epic now correct?</div></div><hr />

You can't complete it until level 46 supposedly. When I did mine long time ago I remember I had a bunch of stuff banked at around level 35. You can do the corrupted mammoth, it's really low level.. hill giant isn't much harder, etc.<br />
 <br />
Have fun! :)</div></div><hr />

You can complete the Epic before 50, but the click effect oes not work for you till 50.<br />
