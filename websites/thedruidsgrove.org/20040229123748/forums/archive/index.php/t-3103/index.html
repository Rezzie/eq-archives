<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aadenla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made a druid as a second character and decided I want to put a lot of time into him because I like the class.My magelo is up to date.I wanted a few pointers on what to look for in gear and what would be nice to upgrade to armor and weapon wise and where exactly is the best place to buy all the spells I need?Is there a list of npc's that have spells to sell in each zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Opivvy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd look for HP/Mana as main stat at such a low level, get as much wisdom as ya can too.  Death Watchers Shroud or Obulous Death shroud is a good shoulder.  Shadel Bandit ring is nice as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arkturus D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Feet - Leather Boots of the Seafarer<br />
Legs - Croc Legs from the ancient croc<br />
Back - Acrylia Studded<br />
Waist - Cobalt Drake Belt<br />
<br />
These 4 are pretty cheap on my server. The boots are 2kish and the rest you can get for under 1k total.  Not sure what kind of budget you're working with so I just tossed up some cheapies.</div></div><hr />
