 <br />
- Innothule Swamp Revamp: As the stench of evil pullulates throughout the region surrounding the home of the trolls, the denizens of the Innothule Swamp surface to see the rejuvenated swamplands. <br />
 <br />

 <br />

*** Items *** <br />
 <br />
- All items that have a clickable aura now have a cast time of .5 seconds. <br />
- Changed the 2 avoidance to 2 DoT shielding for Buckler of Corruption. <br />
 <br />
*** Quests &amp; Events *** <br />
 <br />
- Changed the names of Sacred Stone I and Sacred Stone II to The Kobold Hearthstone and The Stone-fed Shaman respectively. <br />
- Gnashclaw Stonefed will not become &quot;active&quot; until a player on the &quot;The Stone-fed Shaman&quot; quest gets into the area of the orc fort. This should help prevent him from being killed by folks that are not on the quest. <br />
- Gnashclaw's aura now makes the orcs near him a bit tougher, so beware the Stone-fed shaman. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
*** Spells *** <br />
 <br />
- Sorcerer's Spell Guard now has its hit limit reinstated. <br />
- Less powerful pet focus effects should no longer override more powerful pet focus effects. <br />
- Sporali Advisor should no longer be overwritten by Malo. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
*** Tradeskills *** <br />
 <br />
- It seems that the gnomes made a mistake on the roboboar supplemental upgrades. They have since adjusted the containers so that all will work appropriately. (The recipes were bugged, now they work. There will be no change as far as you the players see, other than the fact that it will now work.) <br />
 <br />
 <br />
*** AA *** <br />
 <br />
- Added a damage component to the wizard AA Cryomancy. <br />
 - Removed ranks 4 - 6 of Blood Tithe.  All points spent on this ability have been refunded. <br />
- Modified the way the Wizard AAs Frenzied Devastation and Prolonged Destruction work so that they will have a buff icon when active. <br />
- Increased the cost of Glyph of Arcane Secrets to 4 points. <br />
- Corrected the &quot;Heart of&quot; and &quot;Core of&quot; AA lines to only require rank 1 of their respective prerequisite AA lines instead of rank 3, as it used to be. <br />
- Separated the Paladin and Shadow Knight &quot;Steed&quot; lines. <br />
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4 and 5 of the Innate Lung Capacity line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing lung capacity by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Extended Notes line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the bard song range by the appropriate percentage and will now increase it by the same percentage as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Double Riposte line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-riposte rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />

- Corrected an issue with Ranks 4, 5, and 6 of the Knight's Advantage line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the double-attack rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 7, 8, and 9 of the Speed of the Knight line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the rate to fire an additional 2H attack by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 - Corrected an issue with Ranks 7, 8, and 9 of the Fury of Magic line of AA's for Clerics, Druids, Shaman, Enchanters, Magicians, and Necromancers. These ranks were not increasing the spell crit-rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 9, 10, and 11 of the Spell Casting Fury Mastery line of AA's for Wizards. These ranks were not increasing the spell crit-rate by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
- Corrected an issue with Ranks 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 of the Lightning Strike line of AA's. These ranks were not increasing the flurry chance by the appropriate amount and will now increase it by the same amount as they did prior to the AA consolidation. <br />
 <br />
 <br />

 <br />
 <br />
*** Miscellaneous *** <br />
 <br />
- Fixed an issue with the Rogue's Backstab ability button that caused it not to work when clicking it too many times before it was ready to be activated again.<br />
