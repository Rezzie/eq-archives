I have 3 Level 70s and a level 54 Pally on the way who will probably be 70 before the expansion hits.<br />
<br />
First there was the rogue, fun for PVP, but sometimes annoyingly squishy for solo questing.  <br />
<br />
Then i started a hunter, and got totally sucked in to the rare pet game.  My hunter is half epics and still gets called on as dps in instance runs for my guild.<br />
<br />
Then came Tank, who is by far my favourite class, built after discovering we always were short a tank.  I love my ferel druid, and Kitty dps is always an option at over 3000AP unbuffed.<br />
<br />
But about a month ago, I started levelling a Palladin.  Why? you may ask.   well after getting a pretty good tanking toon together, i found it increasingly hard to find good healers!  So off I go again, levelling in the same old places.<br />
<br />
One more toon and I can multibox a heroic lol!<br />
<br />
Anyway, no questions, apart from the obvious &quot;am I nuts?&quot;<br />
just thought I would let you all know my current state of mental unrest!  :nerd:</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've had my druid since day 1 of wow and he is still my only 70 ! with well over 100 days played on him !<br />
<br />
my only other char of note is a 57 mage whose not gained a level in about 12 months ! :grin:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I know another, totally seperate guy, who actually has 40k gold..<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I've only the one level 70 druid.  Other classes just aren't as cool :&gt;  I started levelling a second druid..  ho hum.<br />

<br />
wonder if it will be the same in wrath.</div></div><hr />

And a Mage permanently stuck at level 58. I am decidedly sick of leveling.</div></div><hr />

Mid 60s: Mage<br />
50s:  Rogue, Priest<br />
40s:  Druid (and rising fast)... yes its my second alliance one.<br />
30s:  Warrior<br />
Sub 30s:  Shaman<br />
<br />
My personal goal is to get the Mage, Rogue, Priest and druid to 68-70 before the expansion....<br />
<br />
Leveling alts is kind of a hobby for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 09:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">why would u want another ally 70 druid ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why wouldn't I?????<br />
<br />
Ok more honestly... I'm sick of having NO bag space.  I have my tank gear.  I have my DPS gear... I have my healing gear.  I have my resist gear... I have my boomkin gear... I have my.... you get the point.  Having a second druid I spread those roles around.  So I don't have to worry about my druids keeping 6 18 slot bags FULL of gear.  <br />
<br />
Plus I love druids.... what's not to like????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tankwhomee</div><div class="date">10-03-2008, 03:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">must admit, a boomkin form druid to add to my set would be kinda cool, i dont normally play casters but for a druid i would make an exception :P<br />
<br />
hmmm, maybe once i finish my pally, then i will have to take engineering and tailoring lol (only professions i dont have apart from LW/SK which i had on my rogue at 350 and abandoned)</div></div><hr />

The bag space is an issue too, although not so much these days since I spent all my of gold coins on a nice set of 4 big bags from Haris Pilton.  Fashion drood !<br />
<br />
Anyways yus...<br />
Plus I love druids.... what's not to like????<br />

<br />
at the time i was aiming for 25k gold so was saving.<br />
<br />
i reckon there should be big 30 slots available in wrath....</div></div><hr />

<br />
back to topic:<br />

Skwidrific is still my one and only 70... i tihnk my wife would kill me if i told her that i was going to try to level another toon lol</div></div><hr />
