Seems like most things summon and eat soft and squishy druids like me.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.  I just need a place to pop into when I have an hour or so to solo.<br />

However I would suggest that instead of this you go and charm kite in Icefall Glacier, best the mammoths then when u like 77-80 go to Loping Plains and do gators or worgs</div></div><hr />

Since SoE made Sunderock a hot zone, you might try there.  Loping is an alright place to solo you should be alble to handle it at your level.  Plus you could do Minos/Worgs/Orcs for Fanbreakers faction to get those RK II spells when you get the Lvls.  I like Zeka Ent myself but you need a good mana pool to effectively kill there fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zacory</div><div class="date">09-18-2008, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I second the suggestion of charming mammoths in icefall.  Just be weary of mobs that con yellow / red.  The lvl 71 charm spell can only charm animals up to lvl 73.  There are a few 74-75 mammoths out there - Large and Eldar.<br />
<br />
Other suggestions I have include root rotting mamoths / bears in Icefall, quadding at tables in PoFire (mobs still DB to you through lvl 73), root rot basilisks in Sunderrock.  The &quot;a stonefin basilisk&quot; ranges from lvl 63-70 and the elders are from 67-69.  All those Basilisks crawl very slowly when snared.  Also there is root rotting or agro kiting the snakes at the greenhouse in Katta Castrum.<br />
<br />
But imo, if you can get down your reverse charming technique - the mammoth's in icefall is your quickest route for exp.<br />
<br />
Another option I have for you is the &quot;Fenden quests&quot; in Dragonscale Hills.  I honestly am not sure of the minimum level requirements to obtain these tasks but I'm sure you can get them at 75.  The &quot;quick errand&quot; and 2 different &quot;special favor&quot; tasks are simple run here and do that.  When I reached lvl 76 and got the new harmony spell, i was also able to solo the &quot;quick combat&quot; tasks to kill Minotaurs, Wind Nymphs, and Orcs.  Combine these with the &quot;reducing the threat - Wereorcs&quot; task from Tyrinam in Loping Plains for a bonus reward every 20 kills!  You can get these &quot;Fenden&quot; tasks only once per 17 hours from Fenden.  But when you rack up like 7-10 completed tasks and do turn ins for rewards (exp &amp; faction &amp; faycitum in some cases), you will see the exp bar jump!  If I recall correctly, I was able to get around 20-25% reg exp from turning in 11 of these types of quests.<br />

Good luck to you Robart!</div></div><hr />
