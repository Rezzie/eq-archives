<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I've seen a lot of threads on horses, but I'm still not 100% certain if it's worth it.  I have a 10k dogmor right now, and I'm seriously considering buying the fastest one.  But before I waste 100k, I need some facts.<br />
<br />
With the fastest Dogmor:<br />
<br />
1. Are you faster than SOE?<br />
<br />
2. Does it still have the slow down, start up delay? (I heard it didn't which is why I want it)<br />
<br />
3. How does shrink affect it? (Can you loot, target others, etc?)<br />
<br />
4. Does a horse/dogmor affect your ability to be stunned?<br />
<br />
5. Any other benefits/problems you'd care to share?<br />
<br />
Those of you that have one, please let me know how  you feel about it, and if it's useful soloing.  I solo almost all the time, and as you all know, sometimes you REALLY need to move fast or die.  Those POP mobs don't mess around.  I don't want to spend 100k, so I can die more often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1/ Yes<br />
<br />
2/ Yes, but sometimes it's not that bad, sometimes it's awful, need to recast a few times to get one that's ok<br />
<br />
3/ Same as other drogmors<br />
<br />
4/ Same as other drogmors<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no difference with the other ones except the speed, so you should have a good idea of what to expect already.<br />
<br />
I kite all the times on mine and I have yet to die from it, but yes I get hit sometimes because it still takes a bit to start moving, but I can take a few hits without problems, up to you to see if you can survive a few hits or not. Or you can keep SoE up and cancel the horse when it gets hard (I don't because taking a few hits is worth it if I can outrun the mob to snare him afterwards, which is harder with just soe).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zephaus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;1. Are you faster than SOE?[/quote]<br />
<br />
My understanding of the fastest horse/lizard you can buy is that it runs at &lt;strong&gt;unmodified&lt;/strong&gt; Bard speed, Selo's Song of Travel, which is a 65% movement increase.  FoE is also a 65% movement increase (SoE is only 60%).  In my eyes, it wasn't worth it.  I bought the slow, fat horse for 8k and use it in places where I won't need to run very often. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have tested it, it goes faster than SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuvian Caelestis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's what he said. He also said it's the same as FoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Really? I remember running faster than people with FoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>iegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My 103k Drogmar is faster than SOE/FOE.  As is the Form of the Hunter.<br />
<br />
It does have signifigant start/stop lag sometimes when you summon it.<br />
<br />
No, I won't quadkite POP mobs on it.  I may have enough hp to take a few hits from one mob.... but 4, screw that.<br />
<br />
The 103k one is raid friendly, you can keep up with the fast moving raid events quite easily with it and keep your mana up quite nicely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Casai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">can you still get horse benifits if you have the ugly luclin models off? I hate those. Do I need to have both character model+horse/elementals models on to use the horse now? There was a patch a while ago I forget now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RetlawEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yes, you are REQUIRED to have your race model on if you want to use the horse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ElliseEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;It does have signifigant start/stop lag sometimes when you summon it.[/quote]Just keep recasting it until you get a horse/lizard with some brakes.  Happens to me all the time~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So the start/stop delays change with each summoned steed?  That seems strange.  But good news either way.<br />
<br />
Would people recommend a Drogmor over a horse?  And why?<br />
I'm about to invest 100k in one of these things, I'd hate to make a wrong move.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwynet Woodsister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, you often need to summon a few ones in order to get one that will have fast reactions. With patience you get really good ones too :) <br />
<br />
I had the 103k horse, and bought the 103k drogmor. Lost 30k or so but haven't regretted it one bit. Yes, the movement on the drogmor is a bit weird, but not having the head in the way is much much much better. With the horse I couldn't target anything nor loot a corpse without having to type /loot lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fayne Dethe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I heavily despise the new model looks, and they bring alot of unneeded lag to a raid.    That and the fact that you can't duck on a horse is why I wont use new models/a horse.    I dont understand Sony's unwillingness to let you duck - if they are modelling after &quot;reality&quot; (yeah right), you can easily duck on a horse instead of sitting upright, lol (crouching doesnt mean you have to bend your legs as you can just lean over ;p).<br />
<br />
EDIT:   I answered my own question, yes you can use a horse while in skeleton form without turning on the new ugly models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Viconia deVir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you are in first person view and go invis without having see invis up while on the horsy the head will disapear even after your invis fades.  And your viewpoint will change to as if you weren't mounted.<br />
<br />
Makes running around on unholy steed a lot easier if I just click invis.  Also if you get grown to full size then shrunk down all the way horse will pretty much disapear as well, invis trick works better though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the info, I guess I'm going Dogmor shopping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fenadin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can you sell back a drogmor the same way you sell back a horse and only lose 30% or so of your cash?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SexyPortal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, you can.  I sold my 10k one and got back around 6k<br />
I now have a 103k Black lizard.  Now if I could just teach it to go hunt tradeskill items on its own.....</div></div><hr />
