<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mojo</div><div class="date">11-16-2005, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so im cruisin around in AB lookin for a victim (Proud owner of a 36 Druid(Ghosts) on Mal Ganis). I pop into travel, right, and start heading up the hill to the mill. Where I had a lovely encounter with my arch nemesis (Which I have fought valiantly against in every WSG or AB ive played since lvl 10) Mageus, a mage... durh. I quickly dispense him cause im used to his foolardy tactics of frsot nova/blinking.... shift into cat sprint ftw. <br />
<br />
<br />
Suddenly a freakin Shammy nails me from behind with Frost shock, looking for a way out, I shift into travel to get the frost affect off, and then a hunter and another sham start chasing me around the mill. so, I did the funniest thing ever. Jumped off the cliff rightby the mill, naturally I died. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER... The horde, in all of their infinite wisdom, jumped after me, sucsessfully killing all three. THAT made my day.</div></div><hr />

That is funny.</div></div><hr />

That's what the tooltip says, but that's not exactly what it does.  What it actually does is it lets you fall further before the damage counter starts.  I have tested this as horde by jumping off the bank in Orgrimmar.  A normal jump and you still take damage.  With feline grace, you do not. . .maybe I'm wrong and they just shave off a certain amount from the top of your damage.  I dunno. . .<br />

It's only happened to me twice in a hundred or more games but it was great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can still jump onto that ledge, just gotta take a second before you jump to line it up. ;)</div></div><hr />
