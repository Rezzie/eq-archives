<br />
I have looked around a bit and see quite a few names still here that I remember. For those that dont know or remember me I moderated/owned a special section way back in the day on this board that Sobe had me manage. When we were having issues with everything we discussed getting nerfed on us. I also used to own EQGuide.com - well I still own it, its just dead and has been for years.<br />
<br />
Due to personal issues I left exactly 5 years and 1 day from the time I reactivated my account yesterday. There is nothing like EQ out there and I am proud to be back and part of the druid world. Damn proud.<br />
<br />
Of course I am 6 or so expansions behind and still at level 65 but that just means I have a lot to learn from the Grove and hopefully once I get back in the swing of things will be able to contribute some tidbits here and there.<br />
<br />
I see I have a LOT to catch up on, but I love Ligge and had no interest in going elsewhere when I decided it was time to come back to the MMO world.<br />
<br />
And for those of you that are still naysaying druids... a big fat PFFFFFTTTT!! We have always been an asset to an intelligent group and as raid and / or group leaders if we have the knowledge we are invaluable as leaders from the buffs, the pulling, the escapes, the damage, and the ability to do all that and lead raids without distractions other classes have on them. I also have an enchanter and if I miss a mez due to a tell or side bar discussion during an event people die, as a druid you can manage both ends of being an active participant and organizational leader very well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wanted to say Hi to everyone that is still here and to all of you I have yet to meet!<br />
<br />
See you around I am sure, if you can catch me. :devil:<br />

I will admit coming back today when I finally logged in I felt like a total noob! Everything has changed and I have forgotten soooo much. I am sure some of the people thought I had purchased my account with some ooc questions I asked lol finally someone ran through the zone that had been around forever and knew me and was pleasant enough to vouch for me by saying I wasnt purchased I was just a really old timer and had gone senile... *sigh*</div></div><hr />

Not any worse than joining a new world though and I am sure it will all come back in time.<br />
<br />
I am reupping for the 2 year plan with SOE and I made my donation to the Grove today so I am hear to stay as long as I can. Life changes will prevent my involvement from being what it used to be, but its still great to be back!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class balance is still exactly where it always was.<br />
<br />
Shaman's can slow, druids can't.   Shaman's heal as well as a druid, not to mention cani and have infinite mana.<br />
<br />
The dps divide between druids and Mages/Wizards is bigger then ever.<br />
<br />
Healing has become more of a joke then ever for druids.<br />
<br />
IMO druids have gone from being able to do many things poorly to being able to solo/charm kite and not much else.<br />
<br />
I would gladly give up any ability that we currently suck at (dps, healing, ports, whatever) for 1 thing that we do better then other classes and make us desirable in groups.   Being masters of nothing doesn't make us versatile and makes us nothing!<br />
<br />
Class balance is broken, always has been and instead of getting better it's getting worse.   My past couple months of playing pretty hard has taken a pretty hard toll on me already.   I also box a cleric and an sk.   My level 73 cleric get's groups in HoS, SHIP etc at the drop of a hat.  Level 80 Druid can be lfg for hours and I can't even get a group formed unless I bring the cleric.   Totally freaking stupid.    Course it was this way 6 years ago too.   Nothing has changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I bet you are having fun! :crazy:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well based on what we have returning to the fold I may end up being an enchanter primarily. Ligge is still my first and will always be my main, but a few of the druids in my guild and our coguild network have stayed and far surpassed me in levels/equipment. For some reason we look like we are short on enchanters other than the two boxers so I may be doing a little of both.<br />
<br />
I always have enjoyed being a druid more than anything and with our circle of friends I am never without a group if I want one. It doesnt look like that will change, but I will do whatever is best for the whole as needed. A lot of our past friends that left passed their accounts on to relatives or others in the guild to use as they see fit and needed. None of us, or very few of them, were ever willing to give up their accounts &quot;just in case&quot; we ever came back... no one expected me to return after 5 years though. :)<br />
<br />
Hi Trevize, you are sounding more and more like Aidon these days. Glad to see another old timer still around!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatankawd</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heh, my first time back lurking in several months, and I see a name I remember from the past!  Welcome back Ligge :)<br />
<br />
Not that I'm back myself (too little time for MMOs), but hope your new tour is fun!<br />
<br />
Tat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">04-03-2008, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Tat! Good to see you too.<br />
<br />
I finally found a decent full world map over view and my feelings of inferiority and being overwhelmed with a world that has tripled since the old days is rather daunting, but still looking forward to it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalevalatar</div><div class="date">04-09-2008, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome back! It's really nice to someone who has been gone for years, coming back :) <br />
 <br />
And to be known, there are also those who are quite happy with druid class, enjoy playing one and think it's very powerful class!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">04-09-2008, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have always had fun as a druid (or enchanter) - nerfs be damned!<br />
<br />
Coming back I am not going to be running or rebuilding my guild for raid purposes, but we have enough friends that do so we can add our forces for their purposes.<br />
<br />
This will be a much more laid back approach for me this time, but I am learning stuff as fast as I can so I am not a total noob.<br />
<br />
As former guild and raid leader I was one of the knowledge experts back in the day and boy have the tables turned. Its kind of funny getting advice from people that I once taught... the master has now become the student, no question about it.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to know what game you are talking about, because it certainly isn't EQ. You're in for a rude awakening if you think druids are still a good asset to a group (not that they really ever were even back then).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">04-10-2008, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only rude awakening I have had so far is the past 5 years of knowledge and spell catching up. Its overwhelming, but I am in no big hurry.<br />
<br />
Other than that I have been having a blast when I have time to play and I have not been turned down for a group yet, so I must be offering something.<br />
<br />
Its probably just for the summoned food and water though. /shrug</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It has to be the summoned food and water :texla: So what are you spiking it with, :alc: alcohol?<br />
 <br />
Well, I didn't know you back when, but welcome back to EQ, and really the game is still small, unless your trying to explore.  Everyone is in the new zones and everything else is empty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">05-14-2008, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I have noticed the emptiness in everything not &quot;new&quot; - its actually kind of nice. I always enjoyed my early morning solo runs when everyone else was asleep. Now I can have that anytime I want if I just pick an older zone.<br />
<br />
I took my enchanter to Maidens the other day for a nondruid change of pace day and I dont think I saw a single PC from Nexus to Ahkeva... it was just, well.. weird...<br />
<br />
I even tried to solo Talendor one day because he was up and I was trying to help a friend in Skyfire. As soon as I saw him on track the immediate response was &quot;oh crap, here come the guild&quot; of course 20 minutes later he is still up and I started messing with him for fun. I will go back at 80 and take him. :)</div></div><hr />
