<br />
800x600 (cable TV resolution, not HD or DVD quality) should be ok, afaik.<br />
<br />
I found a deal, quite a deal, on a Sharp XR-10S. Specs can be found:  http://www.projectorcentral.com/Sharp_PG_Series-XR-10S.htm<br />
<br />
The price is $550 incl. shipping, 1yr manuf. warranty, refurb.<br />
<br />
If anyone has experience they can relay, or knowledge of the specific product, I'd appreciate some guidance.</div></div><hr />

We got a screen to around 96 inches before it got so big that we found ourselves having to move our eyes side to side to see the whole picture.<br />
<br />
Final thought.  Go with something at LEAST 2000 lumens and 2000:1 contrast ratio</div></div><hr />

We got a screen to around 96 inches before it got so big that we found ourselves having to move our eyes side to side to see the whole picture.I have a room that can test the limits of what the machine will do but I doubt I'll operate it too close to the 'limit'.<br />
<br />
This whole thing started when I started thinking my 22&quot; was going to look rather dinky in the living room.  A 30&quot; CRT is too heavy to deal with.  A 30&quot; lcd is rather expensive for what you get.  Hence, DLP projector, same money as a lcd, screen basically as big as you like.<br />
<br />
Final thought.  Go with something at LEAST 2000 lumens and 2000:1 contrast ratioThat just happens to exactly match the spec for the machine I am looking at.</div></div><hr />

Careful with the Light life of the bulbs.  Those things can run anywhere from $100-$300 per replacement bulb.</div></div><hr />

Dont be discouraged if it doesnt look perfect out of the box.  My dad and I had to play with the one we tested for 2 hours before we got it right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The family room has a couch flanked by tables and recliners to either side, the projector screen, a crt TV, and dd 5.1.  The other side of the room has a bar with TV overhead and the poker/billiards table.<br />
<br />
Through some creative wiring/switching/bribing the satellite install tech, we're able to 'steal' the other tuners' video feeds and run three seperate channels in this room (We pay for four tuners).  We ordered NFL Sunday Ticket, meaning no matter where you are in this room you have line of sight to at least two crt's, and thus two games.<br />
<br />
I really got to get some pics already.  I've run into so many unanticipated tasks and purchases in this, our first house.</div></div><hr />

That sounds like a sweet setup.</div></div><hr />
