<br />
i DO know that it's probably the biggest part of that 1.2 gig patch download keeping track of the damn things, which im not particularly happy about.<br />
<br />
i also know that there are some really worthless seeming achievments out there.. like /love every every type of level 1 critter in azeroth...<br />
<br />
there are also some pretty cool ones out there, too... like &quot;resilient victory&quot; where you come back from a 500 (or so) resource deficit in AB to win the battle (funnest AB i've had in MONTHS, btw... final score was like 2000 - 1940)... it showed up in /g chat and my guildies were like &quot;whoah... nice skwid!&quot;... remembering someone's comment here i joked: &quot;yea... my e-peen is HUGE&quot; lol<br />
<br />
what are your thoughts on achievements?</div></div><hr />

<br />
like it says i need to go and kill all the bosses in places like <br />
<br />
DM<br />
Strat<br />
Scholo<br />
<br />
!?!?! i mean WTF.  i ran them til my fingers bled in the old days getting loot.<br />
<br />
its even done it with heroics in outland. i have no credit for heroic SP or Ramps etc despite living in them in recent months farming badges.  and despite me having loot that only comes from heroic runs of such places I dont have the achievement ?<br />
<br />
Why ????<br />
<br />
I know running heroics in Outland is not particullarly difficult - and maybe going back to Azeroth and soloing DM and Schol is the same but why should i have to ?<br />
<br />
And yes i am somewhat irritated by the fact that people are getting achievements for things that I did 'properly' and they are now soloing as a 70 or taking a grp of 20 people to do...like say Ony or Neffy etc<br />
<br />
To me its not right and how is it an achievement taking overpowered people to stuff meant for grps of lower levels ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-23-2008, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am on board with most of the other people.  Last night on a ZA run, we got all 4 timers, not much of an achievement these days, but then the vent was flooded with people talking about &quot;oh, I need this achievement, oh I need that acheivement&quot;.  I just wanted to scream!!!   Shut up, and lets finish this!  I have an incredible distain for the achievement system.  About one half of one percent of the acheivements are actually an achievement!  What happened to WoW rewarding for a job well done, or exceeding the normal play skill?  Now it seems everyone has to get the most recent cosume or explore the far reaches of the map.  Grrr, I just don't care and it seems to have alienated those I used to raid with.  No one seems to want to do anything except chase ridiculous achievements.  <br />
<br />
So for now, I am just PuGing my way through badge farm raids in hopes of having my Bear in full T4/5+ gear before WotLK.  I know the gear won't make a big difference but at least it gives me a goal to focus on and allows me to try to maintain my sanity.  <br />
<br />
I turned off the guild announcement for achievments, now... anyway I can automatically mute those talking about them in chat and vent?</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Says I haven't completed most of the outland heroics even though I am exalted with everywhere except LC.  I've ran all them countless times.<br />
 <br />
Also says that I haven't run a lot of the pre-bc instances that I know for a fact that I ran.  I don't get it.<br />
 <br />
The accomplishment thing is doing some good though for people who didn't play pre-bc and just raced through old world stuff to get to 60.  At least now they get to see some of the old stuff, i.e. MC, Ony, BWL etc - it's gotten people to be a little more active and actually doing things.  <br />
 <br />
A ret pally in my guild solo'd Onyxia last night, that's kinda amusing.  I'm gonna clear BWL and MC in a 5man (maybe a few more if people wanna go) group this weekend.  I went and got the Jenkins title a week or so ago, then 4 manned UBRS just for the memories, and to laugh at how easy it was compared to pre-bc.<br />
 <br />
The whole 'explore the whole world' thing is ridiculous.  What a waste of time.  <br />
 <br />
TL;DR There are some fun ones, and there are some really really stupid ones.  If anything it's lead to more world PvP (which everyone loves), as people now have a reason to be outside of Shatt :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
a lot of zones i had 1 place to 'find' so i have done that in the past few days.<br />
<br />
ie places like EPL/WPL/Desolace/Feralas and even in Netherstorm where i did not 'find' a bridge between it and BEM !<br />
<br />
I did feel i achieved something yesterday though in AV.<br />
<br />
I got the Perfect AV or whatever its called - we won without losing a single tower AND we controlled both the mines at our time of victory.  That to me was worthy of an achievement as i dont rememeber ever winning so easily or quickly as to deny the ally's a single tower etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Well see...now that just makes my point.  Beating Alliance by any measure in PvP is not an achievement.  Just take a nap we will eventually beat our selves! :twak: <br />
<br />
...Sorry couldn't resist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cyclone Horde got spanked pretty mercilessly in WSG last night though :( i went something like 1 for 5<br />
<br />
i'd really like to get the &quot;perfect (something or other)&quot; achievement, where i run all 3 flags in a WSG without dieing, but i noticed a LONG time ago that alli tend to gang up on me after i run the first flag... sometimes i can't even make it across the field to even get close to the flagroom</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you go to the eu armory, do a search for your name, it'll be the 8th (or next to last) column over...<br />
<br />
battlegroups don't really mean a whole lot these days, outside of the Bloodlust battlegroup (for the US)... that's where the profesional arena PvP'ers that go to tournements are, for the most part...<br />
<br />
different battlegroups do have their characteristics though... like i said earlier, Cyclone Horde seems to have gotten a decent handle on AV lately, but for a VERY long time after they moved the Horde starting point, it was just a mess (read: a race we just kept losing). Alli seemed to be very organised for a very long time, seeming pretty surgical on their timing on assaults... If i went on D, i was alone more often than not, and didn't really do a whole lot of good that way</div></div><hr />

It seemed to help.  The usual &quot;10 players stay on D the rest on O&quot; never worked.  But when one or two would speak up and say they are going to be on &quot;D&quot; it made a difference in the numbers we had on defense.</div></div><hr />

Thats how they would win....F' the defense, and just drop drek.  It used to work, but now you have to have the towers or you can't kill drek, thus the sudden success of the horde in AV.  Blizzard has forced the PvP back into the BG.  Alliance + PvP = fail.<br />
<br />
Now AV is destined to be a 45 min turtle.  /cry.   It was the only BG I would do to farm honor because it was closer to a raid, which is what i really enjoy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">10-29-2008, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a friend of a friend did some honor grinding and some calculations over the course both holiday and non-holiday weekends for all the bg's and surprisingly enough, he came to the conclusion that EotS actually gave the most honor per hour, with AV coming in a close second. he's a warrior though, so im not sure if that would calculate the same for us... <br />
<br />
it's nice to be slowly climbing and clawing my way back up the damage charts in the bg's though...i really do think im onto something with my unchanged spec, and when i have points in RnT and berzerk at level 80, i believe my burst damage is going to be nuclear... we'll see :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
so they changed something about taking towers in AV now ? cant say i realised or noticed at the weekend ! lol<br />
<br />
and is it just a change for Drek and not Vann ?<br />
<br />
on my server we have always seemed to do well at AV winning 65% ish i would say most of the time.<br />
<br />
EotS i deeeeetest with a passion. horde just do not have a clue and i reckon we win 10%.  everyone used to talk about MC pre-mades in there to.....<br />
<br />
WSG also seems to be a difficulty for horde to understand where as AB which i do like is more 50-50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">10-30-2008, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PvP on Azshara sucks... <br />
I think there are too many young folks playing WoW and that PvP is just to much for them to handle(reaction, logical thinking etc.)<br />
<br />
Why i think this? Well lets take a look:<br />
from 08:00 to around 14:00 alliance wins 90% of the time.<br />
from 14:00 to 22:00 horde wins 90% of the time<br />
from 22:00 to open end alliance wins again 90%<br />
<br />
during school and after bedtime alliance rocks the house.<br />
but when the kids come home from school its a mess.<br />
<br />
and the 2nd part is, that alliance (the good side) is far more attractive to 12-13 year olds which start playing WoW. And people who have a longer experience in computer-gaming are more attracted to horde side. <br />
<br />
<br />
so cant really do something about it,<br />
but hey... life goes on ;-D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-30-2008, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never really thought about timing of PvP much, only because I only PvP the daily, or when there is gear I want for PVE.  <br />
<br />
But in hind sight, you are dead on Serg with the timing.  Whenever I get an early start to my PvP after work (before school would let out on server time) my BG's rock!  If I wait an hour or so, then I end up just getting rolled.</div></div><hr />

apart from last sunday evening when horde could not win AV !<br />

otherwise most of my pvp is between 6-9pm i guess.</div></div><hr />

same could possibly be said for Horde, too, but you may very well be onto something, serg...<br />
<br />
i definitely noticed the level of play (read: difficulty to win) shooting WAY up in arena after say, 9ish server time, and i DEFINITELY attribute that to the kiddies going to bed, and the big boys and girls coming out and playing</div></div><hr />

Horde usually D's up pretty nicely, and some of the matches got to be downright boring...<br />
<br />
now with zerging, and my aquatic form glyph, my usual strategy is to mount up, equipping my riding crop, haul a$$ over to BS, tap the flag, cheetah form north to the water, aquatic form north to stabs for a quick tap before it caps, and chaos usually ensues...<br />

 <br />
Used to be fun to D up at the choke point(s) and play a balance of o/d, but now its just zerg.  Which is still fun, games are quicker.  That's definitley seemed to be a theme in 3.0 - no more long drawn out battles, just super quick kills and zergs.  Kinda fun for the time being after all the long drawn out 20+min healer / dps vs healer dps battles.</div></div><hr />

Second one i entered, there was a group of us (about 10, actually) going straight to the AV quartermaster to get our [Frostwolf Howler] (it looks cool, it's an achievement AND counts towards the 10 mount achievment) and D'd up from there... i was hoping there would be a successsful Drek zerg so i could get the (50 honorable kills in Drek's room) achievement, but no such luck.<br />

We came REALLY REALLY close to getting the Perfect AV achievement Friday night... missed the timer on South Bunker by about 15 seconds before we killed Van :(</div></div><hr />
