<br />
There is a trick you can use which - energy allowing - lets you shred twice consecutively after maiming a pve mob.<br />
<br />
Required talent: Shredding Attacks<br />
<br />
Your attack sequence might look something like this:<br />
<br />
1.  Tiger's fury, wait for energy..<br />
2.  &quot;Perfect&quot; pounce.<br />
3.  Faerie Fire (Feral)<br />
4.  Mangle (Cat)<br />
5.  Shred<br />
6.  white damage while you wait for energy to approach full....<br />
7.  MAIM<br />
8.  get behind the mob and shred twice in quick succession, well before the maim effect is due to wear off.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not certain on why this works, but I can make an educated guess.  I suspect that the test that occurs to check whether you are behind a mob for purposes of shredding occurs at client-side (ie on your computer, not the server), whereas the state of the mob and its orientation is controlled server-side.  So if you have a slight latency then when the second shred check is performed, the server has not yet returned the information about the mob turning to face you.<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate if someone can independently verify this as I have not heard of this trick anywhere else.<br />
