If you are going for Pure Dps (5, 10, 25 man), I'd drop those two and go with this:  http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGMsfrd0go0IuAo0Eczb<br />

Picking up Rend and Tear and Shredding Attacks will help your dps a lot (in groups).</div></div><hr />

But still for Kara shade is the only thing i remember it would help with. Otherwise i thought most boss spells aren't interruptable anyways.  iLOTP still preferable for 99% of the time, i see BI if you have extra points at 80.</div></div><hr />

Though I suppose if the mob is &quot;interrupt immune&quot; it wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
Right now I don't see a space for iLotP in anything other than a pure bear build.  A DPS build or a Hybrid build just doesn't have the points to spare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only if you are both raiding at the same time.  I've decided that a hybrid build isn't the way to go.  My gear is good enough that I will outgear the first couple levels in LK, and my damage is plenty good enough for questing and dps'ing in regular 5 mans with my cat gear.<br />
<br />
When I'm tanking I want all the tools I can get, and I admit to having no ambition regarding the damage meters prior to level 75.  We don't have a prayer of competing with rogues or dps warriors until we get Savage Roar at 75, and even then it will be iffy.</div></div><hr />

I'm going kitty for 70-80 just for improved personal DPS while questing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the spec is for pvp as i dont have enough time to raid.<br />
<br />
but i have to decided to stay balance as im really loving it right now. consistantly staying top 3 in BG'S. i lvled as feral which made the grind to 70 very fun and easy. so might go back that way to grind out the next 10 lvls then switch back to balance as there is less down time.<br />
<br />
ty for all your replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-21-2008, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Balance is definitley the way to go in BG's atm.<br />
 <br />
Seems that boomkins are doing tons of damage in every BG I'm in.  I'm healing in BG's on my druid, but getting tired of being killed 100 - 0 by stunlock rogues or ret pallies (even in tree form with imp tree).  I'm thinking of going with a boomkin build until the expo, as my healing / spelldmg gear is better than my feral.<br />
 <br />
I'm definitley respeccing to feral for the leveling tho. Nothing beats feral for leveling :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxGGcfrzceocczho0E<br />
<br />
I'm pretty much solely PvE with a heavy tank emphasis.  In the build I have now, I took Survival Instincts (aka Last Stand) and I have one point in R&amp;T.  While my final build will add both SI and R&amp;T (5/5) plus OoC, I think Primal Precision is a little too important to pass up at this point.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the last 3 points will be -- probably 2 in ILotP and 1 in Brutal Impact, but I could go KotJ for more cat-power too.  We'll see.</div></div><hr />
