<br />
I have a 60 Night Elf Priest on a PvE server, but she has kinda been retired.  Now I am playing with a small group of RL friends on Shadow Moon (PvP).  I love healing and all that, but I wanted to try something new....so I picked a Tauren Druid.  I have to say that I like Horde the best, and as I near 60 on the Druid...I think I am going to have to lean more towards healing talent spec.  Now that I am getting closer to 60 (will probably be there next week....wahoo!!!), I have found that I miss being a Priest...so I might be working on a new Priest on Shadow Moon in my downtime.  <br />
<br />
Right now I'm working on planning out what type of build I will have a 60.  I have a friend that has a 60 Druid on Shadow Moon as well, he PvP's and picked 0/0/51 build.  I haven't decided yet what build I will do, but I do know that I can't wait to go on stealth runs with my boyfriend....it was something I could never do as a Priest.<br />
<br />
Look forward to chatting with  you all on the boards!</div></div><hr />

I am still learning more about the Druid, but then again with Blizz changing things so much who isn't always learning more about their class?  LOL!  I think I've pretty much mastered the Priest with trying just about every decent build and all.  So if any of you have Priest alts that you need help with just send me a PM and I'll help ya out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool.  My Druid on Shadow Moon is going to become my main.  Right now I am trying to get to 60 so fast to run with some RL friends.  Actually my boyfriend is helping me level when I can't at work.  They all want me to hit 60 so we can enjoy PvP and raids and such together.<br />
<br />
What's  your Druid's name?  When I get a chance I will add them to my friends list.<br />
<br />
Oh and if I don't answer when you do pst me....sorry....I could be in a zone with grinding.  Kinda missed a few tells because I've been so into the grinding.</div></div><hr />

Satesh - level 10 Tauren Druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cowbelle</div><div class="date">07-07-2006, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea.  I left my old server with my 60 Priest (she's pretty much retired now).  Too much drama over there....plus I have some RL friends on Shadow Moon with 60's.  That's why I'm rushing to get 60 and have this be my main toon.  <br />
<br />
My priest is level 20 right now.  You will probably be around that level when I start playing her some more.  If you want to group sometime let me know.  Her name is Kellsbelles.  I love having Priests and Druids.  I have a few mage/warlock alts....but I just don't enjoy them as much as the Priest and Druid.  This way when I get her to 60 I can help my guild either way with healing.  If they need more Druids...I'm their girl....if they need another Priest....I'm their girl!  Woohoo!<br />
<br />
Ahhh....I'm just getting so excited....haha!</div></div><hr />
