Every 30 seconds you get a 850 (tier 1) damage DD.  <br />
<br />
I thought it was going to be another DS or a Proc buff, but nope.. straight up free AA nuke that can crit + does extra damage if the mob is above 75% health.  <br />
<br />
I tried it on myself and crited + extra bonus It was close to 2300 damage.  No to shabby for free and every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
Going to add a lot to our dps.  Also will help a lot with long term fights with oom people and lots of druids :)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
   Then i see other aa's like nature's guardian with a 22 min cool down, given the amount of damage the bear can do and the recast delay, the fact the bear can be 1-rounded b4 it completes the damage. And i look at our epic with the clicky, given its 6 min re-use and short duration. Then i see this ability: 30 second recast is extremely cool, very fast cast time of .5, doesn't cost life like some of the life-burn aa's do,and it can be extended with aa's to over 4k, for free.<br />
 <br />
  Given sony's history of &quot;fixing&quot; things that &quot;didnt work as intended&quot;, i get a little paranoid. a friend bought this aa and from what i see i like it very much. i think it gives us a solid boost of dps that rounds out a druid as a class, but i wont be surprised if i log on and see that dreaded patch message &quot;so and so ability has been brought in line with other abilities and has been fixed&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Just making sure people realize that while you do a great job providing information and feedback here, there were a good number of other druids in beta working hard to get our AA/spells tuned and they should be thanked as well.</div></div><hr />

You could tie it to one of your other nukes. If it's up it goes off. I have my epic tied to my assist key for group grinding for the same reason.</div></div><hr />

Currently I have it linked to my right turn key though you might want to be careful if you haven't used this tactic before and you could end up nuking the wrong mob. <br />

Odd, I never saw him claim to be solely responsible for this AA /boggle<br />

He said he did tuning, he didn't say he was the ONLY one who helped with tuning. We finally have an active CC who listens and then actually does something about it and people still complain and give him grief for it. :ohwell:</div></div><hr />

Nodyin did the tuning actually - Fenier and others provided the feedback. Read the posts after his &quot;I did lots of tuning&quot; - people thanked him for it because his post made it sound like he was responsible for it all. There were others involved and I pointed it out.<br />

A simple &quot;Lot of the druids, including myself provided a lot feedback to this AA that saw it significantly revamped to what we have today&quot; would have been a lot more appropriate.</div></div><hr />

I'd HATE to see where the druid spells would have been this expansion without Fenier as CC.<br />

Some of the druids you mentioned in your post wanted to do away with the AA entirely. So, yes they did a fabulous job helping with the tuning.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It takes input from a lot of people.  Some are more vocal.  Some have chosen to take on the responsibility of helping tune certain content.<br />
 <br />
I wanted to congratulate nduma... he has posted in this forum.  Does that mean he is the only one that posted?  Does it mean he was the first to post?  No, but he has contributed.  Do you feel jaded that someone said &quot;I did a good bit of tuning&quot; and didn't in the same breath mention your name?  Are you envious that Fenier is the CC?  I don't understand why you are upset that he mentioned his work he had done on this aa and didn't list everyone else that helped by name.<br />
 <br />
Correct... Fenier did not go into the database and personally change the numbers.  So I wish to amend your comment to &quot;none of the people you listed did any actual tuning either.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I did feel the urge to point that there were others, Fenier along side them, that contributed heavily to the feedback of the AA though and if people like this AA, then they have them to thank as well.<br />

Sorry that resulted in this thread devolving into this. It turned out to be a nice AA from what I saw in beta, don't have the AA saved on live to buy it. Working on new GoM next.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, an improvement that's barely noticable in real content though. That's not saying a whole lot. It's still less damage (without the second hit, with it it's slightly more) than a level 60 nuke, the only thing it has over said low level nuke is the speed at which it is cast (mana on such a low level nuke is nearly negligible), but then you're sitting there waiting for it to refresh for 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
It's only 35 / 61.666... DPS, and even then that isn't a constant DPS. It's a far cry from what Dire Charm was during it's heyday in PoP was, and for a class in such dire need of help in terms of DPS it's barely a drop in a bucket that has a hole in the bottom of it.</div></div><hr />

Mine is 1377 base, 45 second recast (so 30.6 dps if I chain it)...oh and did I mention it is disease based, with no resist modifier? So it actually lands for much, much less than base a significant portion of the time.<br />
 <br />
As you might surmise from that spell, yes I'm an SK, and you'll probably claim that I have no right to compare a spell of mine to an aa of yours. Along with the fact that I tank and you heal, I can picture a million arguments for why you'll disregard my comment, and in a way it is meant to be somewhat facetious because I know we aren't anywhere near equivalent classes. I think we all agree that both druids and SK's need a dps boost, but if you're going to complain about getting something free that is better than many classes get for their normal &quot;dps&quot; (and have to use mana and spell gems for), that just seems a little bit narrow-sighted. I'd spend 5 times the aa's it costs you for the same ability, in a heartbeat.<br />

<br />
I basically started out like Tenille did, not remembering to utilize it until mobs were &lt;50%, if at all.<br />
<br />
Then as I was bored soloing, I remembered I switched out the normal spot for forage on the first lineup of spells and things I do and managed to nuke a mob for 2050+ and another 850 in the same casting.<br />
<br />
I like it. It's rather more impressive than our Wrath of the Wild because it can crit (not with the power of AtU, but after it pays for itself in AA points over time, I still won't be disappointed with it).<br />
<br />
With the super low casting time, the low resist rate and the seeming lack of aggro from this AA, I know I made a good choice to replace Forage on the main page with .. finally.<br />

The .. uh .. earlier derision in a public setting is quite disappointing. I truly hope TDG doesn't become 'politically correct'.<br />

From what I have observed, Fenier is not a glory hound nor an egomaniac--I trust that if he said 'I did a good bit of fine tuning Xxxxxx' he's not telling us that it's only great because he did all the work. Anyone that thinks that can't possibly know Fenier. /shrug<br />

But anyone can find fault if they're looking for it. Anything can be misconstrued as malignant when observed incorrectly.<br />
