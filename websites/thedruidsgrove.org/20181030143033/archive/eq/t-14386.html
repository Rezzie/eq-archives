<br />
Getting upgrade to GoM for sure.<br />
<br />
Puts me at 33.<br />
<br />
Probly as many ranks of Healing Surge as they allow you at 71.  I need to see the lucy data before I commit to buying the upgrade to Resplendant early or not.<br />
<br />
From there probly the upgrade to Mental Clairty and whatever is left toward expanding the FT cap.<br />
<br />
Between both those two lines, we're looking at what? 11 Mana more per tick.  That will help alot toward the need to enter downtime regen.<br />
<br />
Once healing is done I plan to focus on the DPS side of things, starting with the bear and increased critical chance.<br />

<br />
 Gift of Radiant Mana 	<br />
 Spirit of the White Wolf (may depend on how much mana is saved)<br />
<br />
One level in each of the following :-<br />
<br />
 Volatile Mana<br />
 Mana Fury<br />
 Blood Tithe<br />
 Healing Surge<br />
 Spirit of the Ancient Grove (reflect damage rather than a ds will be nice)<br />
<br />
A couple of levels in :-<br />
<br />
 Labyrinthine Mind<br />
 Mental Serenity<br />
<br />
I used a similar method when DoD came out and brought the 1st level of everything I could. Unlike DoD I'll be stuck levelling for a while until I can get more AAs.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
And what happened to channeling focus?  I liked those aa's. =/  Like Focus in EQ2, Channeling in EQ1 was always something I liked, since having spells interrupted usually leads to someone's death.  Crap.  But then again, that's more aa's to spend on new stuff I guess.  Mixed feelings lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rasherre wants to rework the channeling system at some point, and the AA line will be added back then.<br />
<br />
Note, you can still be interupted by movement, stuns, bashes, etc.  <br />

Glad we're getting our aa's back then if it's been broken. And all this time I thought I was regaining concentration because of those aa's lol. Guess I'm just better than I thought. =P Would be nice if it was reworked though in a way where we could get aa's that actually did decrease our interrupts. Oh well, more points for me for new stuff. =)  I was just worried that my interrupts were going to increase, looks like it'll be the same so that's cool</div></div><hr />

<br />
Channeling Focus has to do with your ability to channel a spell.  This is broken, and currently happens 100% of the time as is. Hence the refund.<br />
<br />
Pers Casting only checks to see if you can continue casting though a stun.<br />
<br />
As per the patch message pers Casting is not being refunded.</div></div><hr />

yup! and I am 99% sure I used it indoors on beta, a few of us were living in Vergalid for hours doing this quest. It's not a permanent illusion but refreshes often and you can already be in an illusion and hit this. Similar to the beastial alignment type aa's where they turn into a big kitty or whatever then revert back to normal after a minute or two.<br />
<br />
Most of the aa's are scaled - can't buy all levels at 71. Depending on how fast you level could affect how fast you want to spend yours. I will have 44 to spend and I think I will spend a few (extra potion belt, GoM upgrade, some ft) off the bat and then just sit on a few.<br />
<br />
on a side note, and because I completely cannot remember from Beta. We get 2 free buff slots - what levels did we get those again? 73 &amp; 75 or 72 &amp; 75?</div></div><hr />

Personally I grabbed the first lvl of Healing Surge.  As for the debate in mental clarity, i guess i keep thinking of our raids, and there isnt always time to sit and med.  I dont want someones death on my concious so i will spend aas on that as well.  Extended version of Gift of mana is also one i am grabbing.  From there im saving the rest to see what i find usefull as i go, after all dont have to spend them right away.</div></div><hr />
