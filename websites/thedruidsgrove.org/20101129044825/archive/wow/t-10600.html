<br />
Some Level 16 character comes up to you, and asks you to take him through Deadmines.  Says it's his first time.  What the heck, it's a fun dungeon with some good drops, so you go for it.<br />
<br />
You do all the work, trying to keep your buddy alive, and killing everything.  Meanwhile, he's got a shot at all the good drops, and he seems to know quite a bit about what drops where.<br />
<br />
You're not quite sure, maybe he's just checked thottbot in advance, or maybe he's a twink.<br />
<br />
ALT Detector to the rescue! :sumo:</div></div><hr />

If he told you he was an ALT would you have refused? I agree they should be upfront about it, but at least they aren't running with their 60 and sending all the BOEs to their ALT.</div></div><hr />
