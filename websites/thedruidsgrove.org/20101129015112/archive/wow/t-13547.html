Hehe. Of all the buffs he was screaming about wisdom it seemed was the thing he did need most.... why must people get so irate playing a game. I know we are all addicted to some extent. My mother in law keeps saying &quot; you must come over, i have recorded a TV show all about the addiction to warcraft&quot; no sure what she is implying.... i only play 4 nights a week, i dont log in if im still awake when the wife goes to bed on the other nights. Plus i never get up at 6am now to do my dailies...... also when im not playing im not allways planning the next raid or reading books about the game. Nor do i write rambling nonsence which is game related on any kind of game related forum. It is not true i always get up early on a wednesday to log in before work only to be reminded every wednesday it is server maintenance day and all EU servers will be offline until 11am... blah! <br />
<br />
Oh!<br />
<br />
wait...<br />
<br />
its all true.<br />

Hello my name is Elventra and i am an addict! <br />
<br />
Anyway. Back on course. I read a blog post about the joys of pugging and believe me i have met my share of muppets. But fear not folks. All is not doom and gloom. I recently joined a random pug to pit of saron. I was convinced it was going to be a disaster after our tank body pulled and caused a wipe then said something random and left the group. I was in as healer and said i would respec to my tank spec as it was easier to find a healer than a tank. Which i did just as a new tank joined. Hmm after a bit of confusion which we sorted out we stormed off and finished the instance. As i have only ever dabbled as cat form and dont know what im doing at all i /w the druid who had joined as tank who suggested i go cat as his gear score was 6k, nearly 1k over mine. But in true form i sent the /w to a dk who was in our group. By the time i realised the druid had left the group and the dk was asking what exactly i wanted to know...... seems he has a level 80 cat and we ended up staying in the group inside the instance for about 2 hours chatting. Funny how things turn out. Like me he is an officer in a guild and we both rolled alts on each others servers and will drop in from time to time to say hi. <br />

Not all addictions are bad it seems ;)<br />
