<br />
I have a limited understanding of how the quests/rewards work - basically I flag myself then sit around in one of the areas until the required time is up - more people in my group = less time, right?  Then I get a mark for each area 'taken over', and one for each member of the opposite faction killed while still in the area.<br />
<br />
I know I get the Thrallmar marks from the Hellfire Peninsula objectives, but I could swear I read somewhere that you get marks from the Twin Spires PVP area in Zangarmarsh too.<br />
<br />
There have been some threads that I've read somewhere or the other about alliance and horde folks going from objective to objective to help each other get the appropriate marks.  Is this still true?<br />
<br />
Any other tips / tricks?  <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

The marker in the bar will move toward your faction while you are in it.  Once it reaches your faction's color, you get credit for the cap and you can leave.- more people in my group = less time, right?I believe this is true.Then I get a mark for each area 'taken over', and one for each member of the opposite faction killed while still in the area.You get 3 for completing the quest and 1 for each kill that occurs within a fort.  You have to turn in the quest and accept it again for the next day.I know I get the Thrallmar marks from the Hellfire Peninsula objectives, but I could swear I read somewhere that you get marks from the Twin Spires PVP area in Zangarmarsh too.The towers in Zangarmarsh don't help you earn marks.<br />

you have to be on the ground for the flag bar to move.  flying over the station doesn't count.  you have to be on the building or the ground.  IOW, if you don't see the bar on the screen, it is not moving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Capped all three, then got an extra mark for the kill of a foolish 61 Nelf hunter who attacked the 59 warrior in my group (Me 65, Rogue 70, War 59) - apparently he didn't have Track Humanoid up and thought he would swoop in on the solo warrior for a free kill. Oops.<br />
<br />
Now to do it 9 more times...<br />

I can't wait for my Druid to level the last few level to get to Outland.</div></div><hr />

I think that is why it is now a daily quest.  You use to be able to get 30+ marks in about 2 hours.</div></div><hr />
