I can kite with him (use merc like a rogue) but forget about taking out any mobs that summon.  It upsets me a bit because I watch my SK friend with a healer merc easily handle those same mobs.  Are there any tricks for druids and mercs?  I just don't see much value in even using the merc since he sucks so much EXP....<br />

 <br />
I notice mine can't keep aggro for crap unless she's got Haste &amp; Strength for sure.<br />
 <br />
Compared to a real tank, her HPs aren't so great. But, compared to my HPs? she's purty good, so depending on the situation, I definitely take advantage of her plate armor.<br />
 <br />
I do 1 of 3 things when soloing w/ a merc...<br />
 <br />
1) let her tank the mob, heal her, just dot and try not to draw *too* much aggro (i.e. stay away from 3 big blasts in a row)<br />
 <br />
2) kite the mob and let her just follow along and hit it from behind (this happens if I accidentally steal aggro b/c she has no haste, or if she's getting hit too hard and it's more mana efficient to kite than it is to continually heal her)<br />
 <br />
3) Let her die. If I have a few mobs I'm trying to kill at the same time, I snare one, she runs in and takes all aggro from 3+mobs -- snare and dot all of them asap.. she's usually about dead by this time.. and i just kite em around. By the time I'm done, tank is ready to be revived again. Saves me from the &quot;oh noez! snare didn't land and 5 insanely hard hitting mobs are chasing after meh! evac!)<br />
 <br />
Overall, mercs are a pretty good help. While warrior mercs do kind of suck sometimes... so do the cleric ones... they take ninja afks and forget to heal every so often...:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Other things you can try to help the tank merc, is watch the debuffs, snare, the fire dot especially was huge aggro.  A dirty trick is to swap the merc on passive when it has aggro and kite that way, can help the summoners some.<br />

side note...<br />

with the high hitters in Sod, made worse by the high hitpoints of the mobs, getting randomly gibbed a minute or so into the fight on my ranger against trash mobs was quite annoying.</div></div><hr />
