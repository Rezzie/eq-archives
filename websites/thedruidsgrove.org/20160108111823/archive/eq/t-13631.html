If it is a charm kite zone would be just awesome (I love charm kiting) but any soloing technique will do.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help. :texla:</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The 69.1 Hard mission has been a popular spot for some guildies of mine to kite for excellent exp. It takes place in an instanced version of the Hive so no competition.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
It seems to me that rooting and dotting, getting the same nuke damage every 6 seconds, while sitting/medding, is much more effective. I've tried kiting and while the kills might be faster, you still get some resists and generally just use more mana.</div></div><hr />

You get the option to be the tortoise or the hare while soloing.  Sustainable mana use and you can solo forever with no downtime.  Or all-out dpsing and you can run oom quickly and have 10 minutes of downtime.  Trick is finding the balance between the two =p</div></div><hr />

It's easy to get to, instanced so it runs at my pace, and good AA exp to boot.<br />

The mobs at the top of the ramp are always yellow cons, and none put up much of a fight.   There's a huge area to kite, but be warned if you're going to bring mobs down the ramp towards the zone-in.   I generally snare pull and walk the mobs down the ramp, hugging the ground as I go.   Put too much distance between you and the mob, or too much variance in the Z-axis and rest assured the mob WILL warp onto your head.   Slow controlled pull ftw ~    Beware the chanter mobs and cleric mobs will gate on occasion, just kill them close to spawn point to avoid that mess.<br />
<br />
Oh ... there's also loads of tunnels to kite through up the ramp beyond the door.  Invis vs Undead potions fool most of the mobs, although some do see through everything.   In the tunnels you'll find a mix of yellow white blue cons, not everything is yellow beyond the door.  Nothing summons except the named, might want to avoid those solo, ouchie.</div></div><hr />
