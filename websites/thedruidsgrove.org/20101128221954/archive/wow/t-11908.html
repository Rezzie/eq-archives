<br />
Can you give me some advice please?  I am resto spec (with tree form).  I currently use:<br />
Glowing Brightwood Staff <br />
(+15 STAM; +29 INT; +9 SPIRIT; +15 nature resist; with +55 Healing enchant)<br />
<br />
Should I change it for:<br />
Healer's Staff of the Forest<br />
(+34 STAM; +23 INT.  Increase healing up to 115)<br />
<br />
As healing in tree form is increased by 25% of total spirit.... will the extra +60 healing that the Healer's staff give compensate for the loss of 9 Spirit that I currently have from Brightwood Staff?  I only use this staff when healing in instances.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />

But there are much better two-handed weapons out there. Which level are you?</div></div><hr />

stats are nice to have but in the end it all comes down to how much you can heal for the tree healing style is all about HOT's and you get almost all of you +heal on them.</div></div><hr />
