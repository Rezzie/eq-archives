It leads to death quite easy.<br />
Is there a way to actually have both accounts, 2 characters on the same screen at the same time and being able to control them both with different keys? Like one character take up half the screen and the other character take up second half of screen?<br />
If so, how would I do this?<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

I still have to alt-tab to switch which one I'm controlling, but it's a lot easier than what it sounds like you're doing.</div></div><hr />

To resize the window, make sure you're in windowed mode, then just drag the edges of the window like you would with any other program.  (You'll need to have window resizing enabled: Options-&gt;Display-&gt;&quot;Allow window resizing&quot;.  You can then disable this once you have the window sized appropriately, if you want.)</div></div><hr />

If they are different then every time you change window the computer will reset the resolution, and force you to wait a second.  I set both my pc's and EQ's resolution to something like 1280*1024.</div></div><hr />
