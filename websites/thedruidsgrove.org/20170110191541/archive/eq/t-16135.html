We're on the same server (The Tribunal) and raid from 5pm to 9pm Pacific time.  So, 3/4 of our raid time is after 6pm. :)  It's not ideal but you'd save yourself the hassle of a server transfer.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing that you've already considered other guilds on the Tribunal, but I thought I'd post just in case you haven't.  Brenya, our recruit officer, would be the best person to talk to if you're interested.  Feel free to talk to me (Palarran) too.<br />
<br />
For anyone else reading this, our primary raid target as of this post is Ashengate.  We'll be entering Frostcrypt shortly, and we occasionally hit the Demiplane and Deathknell.  We raid every day except Friday but do not expect people to make it to every raid; we simply expect you to raid if you're logged in during raid hours.  We're a stable guild with a long history.<br />
<br />
At the moment we're a bit low on druids.  It's getting too quiet in our druid channel!</div></div><hr />

- Guild raids Sun-Thur (never on Fri/Sat) and we look for 3x/week attendance or more.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
First kill on Ayonae Ro 2 weeks ago with repeat this week (with Demi clearings); working AG factioning and Vergalid (~42 flagged for AG and Nurtha/Goru RIP 7/30/07).<br />

We do have a guild on the server that raids 9pm-1am PST (they're Sendaii away from entering Demi).</div></div><hr />

Another is Descendants, on Saryrn. I am not sure how high druids fall on the 'need' list atm tho.</div></div><hr />
