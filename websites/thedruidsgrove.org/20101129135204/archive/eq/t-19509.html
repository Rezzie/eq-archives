It must have seemed so perfect. An obscure blogger unearths some pages of President Obama's college thesis. The report supposedly comes from big-time journalist Joe Klein of Time magazine. And the thesis has some real gems: like Obama's disdain for the Constitution.<br />
<br />
The whole thing was nothing more than a satirical post on a humor blog. But Rush Limbaugh, who quoted from the supposed thesis on his radio show, sure wasn't laughing. Here's how it went down.<br />
<br />
An unknown blogger picked up on a made-up post meant as a joke, which claimed that Joe Klein had gotten his hands on 10 pages of student Obama's college thesis. Rush Limbaugh jumped on it, which immediately sparked Web searches on &quot;obama thesis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Supposedly titled &quot;Aristocracy Revisited,&quot; the excerpt revealed the president had &quot;doubts&quot; about the &quot;so-called founders.&quot; Juicy. Except not true. Limbaugh discovered halfway through his show that he'd been had, but defended himself by saying basically the thesis felt true. Listen in to Rush's mea sorta culpa.<br />
<br />
Joe Klein finally jumped in, and called the report &quot;nonsense&quot; on his Swampland blog, and the blogger who thought the hoax was real also apologized.<br />
<br />
Let's hope someone kept their sense of humor in all this. Still, for a humble post to go from humor blog to major media outlet sure seems impressive. Someone ought to write their thesis on it. For real.</div></div><hr />

Funny.<br />
<br />
Anyway, who considers Rush as a 'major media outlet'?<br />
<br />
Who are you people?<br />
<br />
He is an on air blogger.  He blogs on air for 3 hours a day, with repeats on the weekends.<br />
<br />
He is not a journalist.  He does not claim that he is.  Last time I checked, he considers himself an entertainer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;A rose by any other name&quot; and all that stuff<br />
He can consider himself the grand poobah of the buffalo club too.<br />
It does not change the fact that he is a 'major media outlet' due to the fact that his shows are popular and his listeners both take what he says seriously and are more likely to act on it. If you want your message across to the conservative sheeple then he is one of those you have to get to spread your words to them. What Limbaugh calls himself is of no importance, other than to deflect criticism if you buy into the rhetoric. (Bush called himself the great communicator, but that did not make him one. Limbaugh calls himself an entertainer not because he is one but because calling himself what he really is, a politician or a demagogue, is not going to endear his target audience to him).<br />

Given the way the republican leadership avoids crossing Rush, it's clear that they think he's more than just an entertainer.  What a bunch of obsequious twits.</div></div><hr />

That bears repeating!  <br />
<br />
Or zombie-like sycophants.  Obviously they've devoured all the brains in their own party. :p</div></div><hr />
