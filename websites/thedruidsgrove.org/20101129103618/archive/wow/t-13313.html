<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-10-2009, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
     I've got all of my resto gear, finally (well except the belt, relic and one trinket- but the badges are sitting there and all I have to do is go get them hehe)<br />
<br />
Before I make the switch from bear to tree, I thought I'd ask which enchants and gems you all recommend for each piece.  Per a certain Tauren's orders, I've just started on Sons of Hodir, so that shoulder enchant is still a little ways off, but I was just wondering if you guys had some recommendations to get started for each slot.  <br />
<br />
There's a possibility I'm going to get thrown headlong into Naxx healing this weekend, and I'm hoping I can get as much enchanted/gemmed before then as I can.  <br />
<br />
Also, the 14/0/57 build and a 11/0/60 build have both been recommended.  I've heard of the dreamstate build and was wondering if you guys have a sort of first hand experience with the builds and can offer advice.  I'm going to pick up some glyphs as soon as I can find them.  Any recommendations?  <br />
<br />
Btw- I've got a guild tank who's willing to let me &quot;learn&quot; how to heal on him in heroics.  Hehe poor guy!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-13-2009, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, first of Des, it sounds like your new guild is a bit more supportive!  (/cheers)   <br />
<br />
For gems / Enchants, pre-3.1 (tuesday, imho) you would want to stack spellpower or spirit.  A good balance of both will work best.  Post 3.1??? I suspect MP5/int are going to have a heavier weight.<br />
<br />
I prefer the 11/0/60 build, but that is pre-3.1.  Dreamstate may be more important in the coming days.  <br />
<br />
I did not do any PTR testing this time around, so I unfortunatley don't have a lot of examples or experience to share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-13-2009, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for the advice.  Yes I was looking at both builds and I think for a starter build I might try 11/0/60, and adjust it as needed post-patch.<br />
<br />
I have to grab some glyphs.  I think the glyphs will prolong the HoTs enough that I can splash heal a little more efficiently.<br />
<br />
I grabbed some shining spellthread for the legs, but I'm trying to figure out which enchants I should grab for the rest of it.  It's a little confusing.<br />
<br />
I'm in my caster gear on the armory (still feral specc'd though)  I healed a reg UK for some 70-ish folks last night as a bear in healer clothing.  It was alright, I guess.  I didn't keep everyone up on the last boss, but I was really nervous and it's a really big change to go from pounding on stuff and wanting it focused on you, to standing back and being the one that keeps the meat shield alive.  I plan to respec tonight, grab some gems and enchants and give it a real try.  I really need a healer mod, but until I get a new PC - something that binds spells to the mouse clicks isn't feasible. :(    (Still using my OP laptop for the time being.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-13-2009, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glyphs post patch, I think you want Lifebloom/Wild Growth/Swiftmend. (You may want Nourish instead of LB depending on healing style....they really nerfed LB hard!)<br />
<br />
Prepatch, swap in somthing for Wildgrowth (Rej/Regr/Innvervate are good ones)<br />
<br />
As for mods, I cannot help too much.  All the mods I have ever used are bound to mouse clicks.  You may be best off using the good &quot;ol'fashion&quot; Wow interface for the time beining.  I definatley reccomend you drag out the raid windows if you are in a group +5 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-13-2009, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds good :)  I'll look for them.  I'll wait and experiment with some mods after I get a few healer runs in and decide if it's something I definitely want to keep doing or if I should consider picking up some other spec for my secondary.<br />
<br />
I hope I can &quot;get it&quot; soon.  Last night's attempt at healing was less than awesome.  Being feral spec'd in healer gear, even for a regular lvl 70 instance made it really tough :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-14-2009, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah healing is very different after tanking and dps for so long.<br />
<br />
i'm sorta slighty considering a healer / oomkin dual spec as we do somethimes lack a healer for 5 mans.<br />
<br />
my oomkin gear is a pretty good healer set to. obviously its crit heavy and spirit/mp5 light but its a good starting place. i'd need to add some crafted/boe purchases from the AH - like a wispcloak and the earthgiving set.<br />
<br />
i got a little taste of healing yesterday when a 68 guildie wanted a run through UK normal for a quest.  turned out he only needed the first boss. so we decided to 3 man it with an 80 DK tank and him plus me to heal rather than dps.<br />
<br />
it was not hard ofc given the 80 DK did not take much damage but it still got me remebering that healing can be stressful ! and healing the 68 DK who only had 10k hp was a little more exciting/stressful (delete as appropriate) seeing his health go rapidly down towards 2-3k with me trying to find the buttons for an appropriate heal spell :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would reccomend you don't decide if you like healing or not until you've had a chance to do it with a heal mod.  Its a completley different playstyle, and much, much less stressful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-14-2009, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khel, I'd look for the Reanimator's cloak, it's a bit cheaper than the wisp-cloak and also a farmable drop if you don't want to spend too much gold at the AH.  It was the recommended starter healing cloak recommended by a resto friend of mine. I believe it was also mentioned on Resto4life?  I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
I have a bunch of strange gear.  I have a few drops from Naxx, and a few crafted, and a few blues.  I really lack in my ring slots.  <br />
<br />
I intend to experiment with some mods, but they seem so confusing.  Grid intimidates me and it doesn't have to try hard.  I've got a former resto druid who has offered to tutor me.  He's going to tank a few things and offer help as we go.  He's been very helpful so far.  <br />
<br />
Do you all have recommendations for gems and enchants?  Should I look for straight up SP?  Mana regen?  Do they...even make...mana regen gems or enchants?  Should I grab Intel enchants?  This caster stuff is so very strange to me.  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">04-14-2009, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use:<br />
<br />
+16 spellpower gem in red slots (Runed Scarlet Ruby)<br />
+6 MP5 or +16 Spirit gem in Blue <br />
+16 Crit gem in Yellow <br />
<br />
I tend to use hybrid gems that include spellpower for the &quot;non-red&quot; slots.  So for Blues I ussually use the purple +sp/stam, and for yellow I use Orange +SP/Crit.<br />
<br />
Enchants:<br />
Head = Wyrmrest Temple Rep Head enchant (+SP/MP5)<br />
Shoulder = SoH rep or Inscrip (+SP/MP5)<br />
Chest = (+8/10 Stats)<br />
Bracer = +SP<br />
Weapon = +SP<br />
Legs = +SP/Spirit or the Crit one is nice too!<br />
Boots = +Spirit<br />
Gloves = +SP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-15-2009, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically anything with + Spirit/MP5 or +Spellpower is a safe choice?<br />
<br />
I seem to have a lot of crit on my gear (as most of it seems to be boomkin gear), so I'm hoping for a bit more spirit for my resto gear.<br />
<br />
I'll try and remember to log out in that gear if you'd like to take a look.  I'm feral at heart, so I spend a lot more time in my Rawr gear than my Tree gear.  I imagine that might change once I get comfortable healing.<br />
<br />
I'm going to go do some research on glyphs.  I don't really  have a healing style yet, but I imagine once I start building in the glyphs, it might help shape how I heal, assuming I get some practice.<br />
<br />
Everyone and their sister went Healer+Another spec last night, or so it seems.  Right now, in our guild, I'm the only Tree/Bear combo though so far.  Go figure.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how to deal with Meta Gem slots?  Noth's Curse has a meta slot, and I'm having a miserable time trying to find a healer gem to fit in there that will match up with the other gems I want to place, and I don't know if I'm wanting to pass up on the +SP socket bonuses...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-15-2009, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was also wondering how much weight Revitalize carries for the Resto tree spec.<br />
<br />
I know our other resto druid has it and possibly another druid picked it up in their resto build.  I haven't.  15% chance seems low, and expensive for 3 points.  Any opinions on this?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-17-2009, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cheers Des - not heard of that cloak - i was gonna get some mats together for a Wispcloak.<br />
<br />
given the nerf i'm seeing as oomkin i'd have thought a resto would want as much mp5/spirit as possible these days....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-17-2009, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khel, I suggested it only based on the price and red gem slot.  The Wispcloak has better stats and spellpower though for sure.  <br />
<br />
Prices on our server:  Wispcloak 1000 gold vs the Reanimator's Cloak which I personally picked up for 25gold.  Also, considering I'm only able to heal when we're in absolutely dire need of a healer...I couldn't see spending 1k gold on a cloak that in all truth probably won't be used all that much...I'll explain the woes of healing in my n00b update post...</div></div><hr />
