<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">B_Delacroix</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yes, I know, there are those among you who think POP is horrid.  There are also a number who think its actually fun.<br />
<br />
Recently I have had the opportunity to get involved in some of the POP content other than the usual experience grind and I have found out why people say it is fun.<br />
<br />
If you are, like I was, stuck with sitting at camps trying to get experience, the expansion is no different than any other.  However, if you get the chance to do some of the interesting events spread all over the expansion, you find that it is really different than anything you've done up to that point.<br />
<br />
Until POP, encounters consisted of gathering a bunch of people together and killing a mob.  The bosses didn't vary much, it was basically a healing rotation on the main tank and everyone else beats the mob till it dies.<br />
<br />
Try out some of the POP encounters, though.  For example, after a bunch of our people left from a Bastion of Thunder tower raid, we ran over just to try out the Brother Mujaki event for the first time.  Yes, there is a boss, yes the basic idea is to beat it down.  However, you have to actually have everyone involved.  You start out removing some horses, then the important thing is to split yourselves up and guard some graves that Mujaki's pals will be exiting from.  Do a good job here and the end will be easier.  This is different from just clearing yard trash to the boss, then beating it up.<br />
<br />
Other events are the Thelin's Nightmare maze, the justice trials, the encounter with Terris Thule.  Saryrn's encounter is extremely long but that is the single most example of the exact opposite of any raid one has done up to that point.  The Zek boys are another example of having to do it different.<br />
<br />
The point is, with POP encounters there is variety and variety is wat makes it fun.  More than just the MT and cleric crew are important.  More than they were important before, but now more people are directly involved.<br />
<br />
So I see now, why people said it was fun.  The only unfortunate thing about that fun is it is limited to only a few who get the opportunity to experience it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nimchip</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually... Yea i agree with you a lot, and I happen to like PoP as well. I think what people don't like about PoP is the flagging process. Casual gamers hate it because they don't have a chance at Elemental stuff and people in powerful guilds hate it because of the reflagging process to flag some other members, or because they find it unfair that they cannot go to a zone where they could easily beat mobs but is restricted by a flag. Well let me tell you, flags can be tedious but I'm kinda glad not everyone is flagged into elementals. There would be MASSIVE trains all over, ksing, ganking, bla bla all the crap that exists in BoT. I consider flags to be stupid until well, elemental planes and up. <br />
<br />
I like the variety in bosses. And I like how this was passed down to GoD (they have some fun events in there). Every Boss has its own tactic which is way more fun than just plowing down the mob with a standard CH rot. For example, Xegony and Rathe events. The first time i did these i was having so much fun, my adrenaline was pumping, i had sweaty palms. Sure I understand some people have farmed these guys so much that they hate these events... oh well you can't please everyone right?</div></div><hr />

And in hindsight that is very satisfying.  Was it fun?  Yes.<br />
<br />
Would I do it again?  I don't think I could stand much more fun like that.  :bonk:  So, now that GoD has been out for a couple of weeks, it seems to be all right.  Not great or shabby, just all right so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BoT had Trains and crap when it still required a flag.  Elemental Flags are a little harder to get, but getting a flag does not mean you are a good player and it sure as heck does not mean you are a polite one.   Frequency of trains may go up because the population is higher.  But people who think flagged people are better players crack me up.</div></div><hr />

There are aspects of the game that I enjoy, I'm not about to quit (most days) and I still get considerable enjoyment out of it, but Velious was hte last expansion that really wowed me.  Maybe it was the level of my play at the time or the people I was playing with or whatever.<br />
<br />
Since I don't consider LoY to be an &quot;expansion&quot;, I would have to say that my least favorite remains LDoN.  <br />
<br />
PoP improved after they finally made changes.  Its &quot;ok&quot;.<br />
<br />
Nothing will compare with velious though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tawnos</div><div class="date">02-23-2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree the encounters in sub-ep pop were varied and mostly interesting.  The unfortunate problem is for the most part nobody wanted to do them very much because the rewards other than the flags were nowhere close to balanced with the time spent on the encounters.  The ep and time encounters sans rathe, xegony, and coirnav were pretty dull.  It seemed like they spent all of their development time on the early encounters and then as the release date loomed they decided to just put a bunch of mobs that hit hard and had some lame ae's in to get the product pushed out on time.<br />
<br />
The potactics rallos zek event was the pinnacle of everquest event design in my opinion.  You actually care about more of your raid than the clerics/tank core.  The ep gods were also pretty well done although still a bit heavily reliant on the tank/healers for xegony and fenin.  From the little i've seen of GOD it is also decent.  Any encounter where the only question isn't 'how many clerics do we have on?' is at least an improvement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a wide variety of strategies one needs to employ to win PoP Raid encounters. Not just the old progression of ever higher DPS and longer heal chains. <br />
<br />
This suits me well as a Druid as some encounters require all the group heal classes (including clerics) be healing their groups while the Druids are the only ones healing the MA. Some encounters I just nuke, some I do a mix. So at the end of the week I have filled all sorts of roles, and no one role got stale.<br />
<br />
In grouping we got away from having to go with the holy trinity of Cleric, Warrior and Shaman or Enchanter. We could round up whoever wanted to go hunt and after a bit of thought, pick a place that suited whatever class mix we had.</div></div><hr />

Over the last 3 weeks to grind say 75 AA in POE primarly.  Most of that at the Zone In.  Do you know in roughly 50 Hours of being at the zone in.  Do you know how many trains I received.  Exactly 1 train of 1 mob.  that is it.<br />
1 Train sitting at a zone in in 50 hours of xping.  <br />
<br />
I think you severly underestimate the difference between the flagged people and the non-flagged.  And usually its because those 7-10 Guilds that have 50-150 members to reach elemental level have TIGHT KNIT organizations.  As such training zone is just not tolerated as easily.  As some unguilded, or guild who is so small they don't care of thier reputation.  That and because they have such a larger pool of friendly resources.  Getting a cleric to come by and rez them is much much easier.  This reduces the need to train the zoneline, as well as increases the consequence of doing so.</div></div><hr />

If everyone isn't on the same page and doing what they should be doing you will lose.  We have done this event like 5 or 6 times by now, definately not a farm status god because of the time:loot ratio is horrible.<br />
<br />
All in all I enjoyed PoP very much, we are working our way through Phase 5 of Time now and so far it's been a blast, lots of interesting challenges to over come.  While it definately wasn't aimed at the casual gamer (as far as advancing down the story line), it did have lots of perks for casual people.<br />

I am looking forward to see what Sony tosses at us in Gates, so far seems like a nice challenge, can't wait to see who hits Tacvi first though.</div></div><hr />

Rathe was really different, but the fact that it took forever wasn't fun.  What I really loved though was time and learning to deal with each of the gods abilities.  Vallon Zek is down right mean when you first run into him.  Innoruuk can be a real blast too.  Quarm was fun too, though it became trivial once you figured out the basics.</div></div><hr />

That squid still makes me sweat.  The timer is just about perfect if you do everything perfectly.  And just a little bit too short if you don't do everything perfektly.</div></div><hr />

Back in the Luclin days, our server's resident uber guild nearly made sport of training folks on their various trips to VT &amp; SSRA.  Many wouldn't even invis, knowing full well they'd create havoc through the whole zone but not really caring.   <br />
<br />
While one might argue that being flagged would increase the liklihood that a player understands better how to avoid trains, etc., that's not often the main issue.  When it comes to common courtesy, my observation is that the ubers rarely act any &quot;better&quot; then the unwashed masses.</div></div><hr />

I am a good player and know my class but my job and life dictate that I will forever be a &quot;casual&quot;.  Still, me and my guild are approaching the elemental planes.  Mostly because we believe we can.</div></div><hr />

If there is any competition for the spawn then guilds quickly get impatient and start bringing HUGE numbers to get it done with already. That of course negates the difficulty of having a win/lose timer so it all becomes rather self defeating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AmonraSet</div><div class="date">02-25-2004, 10:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to be kind of a masochist to like the Coirnav encounter, to me it's actually one of the worst in Everquest. Timers are the cheap, easy(and ultimately moronic) way to make something challenging without any real design effort. I want to be challenged by using different skills and being allowed to fill diverse roles, not racing a clock. Clocks are for other types of games.<br />
<br />
I don't know how you can argue that the Coirnav encounter has been made without any real design effort.  The encounter uses very different tactics to any other encounter in the game and I think is the most enjoyable in the game because people get to use skills they don't normally have a chance to use on a raid.  The designers didn't just arrive at such an encounter by chance - a lot of thought must have gone into the encounter.  The timer is a vital part of this encounter, and if taken away the encounter would become a very dull encounter, much the same as many others in EQ (kill, kill, kill, kill boss, get loot).<br />
<br />
To be sure some timers can be a quick shortcut to making something more challenging as a substitute for a good design, but this just isn't the case with the Coirnav encounter.</div></div><hr />

Therefore I would say that there is a strategy for Coirnav.  Moreover, its a less often used strategy these days that (for most guilds) involved AE.  That makes it rather interesting for me.  Its kill or be zerged.  Kinda fun, but its the laggy environment that kills most of the enjoyment for me.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely nothing wrong with timers.  You dont see people complaining about mob respawn during raids.  Its essentially the same thing in an indirect sense.  It just lets you know youre too slow and need to improve your tactics/pulling/recovery procedures etc.  Coirnav is a great event, you can come away winning that with a rush becuase theres always the doubt that you may not win.  I wish more encounters were like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danixzzel</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild has killed Coirnav plenty, and I know we've never done it perfect.  We've been under 12 minutes on the timer too, so it's not like there's a lack of wiggle room.<br />
<br />
Rathe in alot of ways is the opposite of Coirnav.  It takes forever between spilitting mobs, mezzing/tank mezzing them, and in general requiring alot of people to concentrate alot over an hour to two hour period of time.  What I liked about Rathe (and Xegony, and Coirnav) was that you needed to have every class in your guild on their toes in order to make it happen.  Rallos Zek the Warlord was kind of like that too, except a bit more of a zerg fest.  In fact I'd say Rallos and Coirnav were very similar in that respect, except in one you actualy need to kill the adds rather then just getting the boss dead before your CC dies.<br />
<br />
Anyways, people complain constantly about how SoE relies on the Tank + MT + 50 afk DPS strategy, but PoP went a long ways to do away with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 03:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, PoP you just needed 50 wizards to kill anything...<br />
<br />
Yes PoP did get away from the standard velious model of tank+ch chain+dps, but not a lot.  If a fight wasnt that, it was tank+ch chain + crowd control a bunch of adds (otherwise known as Luclin fights a la Emp)... and throwing a dozen wizards at nearly any PoP encounter is enough to win it.<br />
<br />
If Velious was the Trinity, and Luclin the expansion that gave enchanters something to do, then PoP was just get as much dps as you can get and kill the mob before it kills you and include the Velious and Luclin strats at the same time.  Evolutionary but hardly revolutionary.<br />
<br />
I'd still like to see some raid encounters that gave the less &quot;raid-critical&quot; classes a more shining role.  Yes, this includes letting druids being more than half-assed healers and or 3/5th assed dps.  This just doesnt seem to be in the cards though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for PoP... I loved the variety in the encounters, hated the limitations on numbers after the first or second downing (but that was due to the flags/keys *ugh!*), hated the broken &quot;instancing&quot;, loved my mount until I had to actually SEE it, and I hated the itemization because it further entrenched EQ players in the &quot;I need more and better LOOT&quot; syndrome.  <br />
<br />
As for Coirnav, I always liked that one with one exception.  PoWater itself was always a pain because the lag is SOOOO bad.  PoWater could have been a wonderful experience zone except that few people want to deal with the lag.  Before the timer, Coirnav was TOO easy for a god flag, and when it was broken it was miserable.  Once they fixed the timer and got things to the way they were supposed to be, the encounter became fun.  Druids and any other class that can AE cast... what a refreshing change from patch healing over and over when we can do so much more!  Even the clerics had their moments to do damage.  <br />
<br />
Rathe was my favorite.  Although some complained of it being boring, it was a good test of team.  Now it is so trivial, but the first encounters were a test of mana conservation, player awareness and stamina.  There was a pretty well defined need for EVERY class.  Everyone had a chance to either shine or look the fool individually.  <br />
<br />
Xegony and PoAir I could have done without.  HATE the graphics... VERY masculine hippy &quot;female&quot; who in the real world shoudn't even be seen in public wearing shorts!  Although there were options for CC and main tank support, the poor clerics were relegated to the endless CH chain.  Almost every class had an option of what to do EXCEPT the clerics.<br />
<br />
PoFire... TONS of minis that can be raided either in a full run or as individual encounters.  As equipment went up in quality, the mini encounters were doable by a smaller force, and they were spread out so that you didn't have to take a linear path to kill any of them except Fennin Ro.  Solo, grouping, raiding... excellent zone for all.  The game really needs more PoFires... but I HATED SolRo Tower mini flag requirements to get into SolRo's room.  Some of the minis just take too many hours to even get to.  I think this is really the zone layout more than anything tho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BGrifter</div><div class="date">02-26-2004, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been thinking about this a lot lately, without realizing it over the last six months i've gone from absolutely despising PoP to considering it the best expansion the game has ever seen. Perhaps it's in part to how disappointing LOY, LDoN and thus far GoD have been (all feel like &quot;half-expansions&quot;) or perhaps it's partly joining a guild that's progressing thru the flag mobs, but since the flag changes for XP purposes even casual guilds/gamers get a lot out of PoP.<br />
<br />
The variety of targets above has been mentioned a few times, it's amazing that on a server with five guilds in Time now with two others only (only, heh) missing Corinav and TRC there is still a lot of content to go around. We can backflag and find targets, we can hit mold droppers in the eplanes, catch the occasional FRo to farm or invest a little time working on our TRC strat. There's a LOT to do in this expansion, even on an overcrowded server like Karana.<br />
<br />
For those not raiding, since the flag change there are a lot of excellent places to XP and lots of one groupable mobs/quests. Zones like HoH stand out as exceptional XP spots, really aside from soloing in PoFire or grouping in PoEarth, HoH basement camps are arguably the best XP around. Compared to Velious era gear camps, the stuff acquirable by casual players is astoundingly good, even Ornate and tradeskilled gear is quite good pre-elemental. Best of all, open raiding groups have been springing up across all servers and have been quite successful. Many of them are in the eplanes, and I hear one has even made it into time. The open raiders on Karana have been lagging behind a little but are working hard on RZek (four nights in a row now with no competition for the spawn) which will put about thirty or so of them into the 3planes.<br />
<br />
As a tradeskiller PoP has also been an unbelievably good expansion. A wide variety of very good tradeskill pieces can be created. Everything from Hero Sandwiches and pottery made focus items to eplanes skilled armor pieces, items to fit every budget and level of access to zones. Pretty much every trade (with the possible exception of Brewing) came out a big winner. It'd be tough to go back to a world without Ceramic Totems of Xegony and Steel Rings of Earthen Resilience.<br />
<br />
It took quite a while to work out the kinks, but I think PoP has pretty much become the perfect expansion. Tons of places to solo and group for XP from tier one thru the eplanes, loads of raid targets for guilds of all shapes and sizes, and dare I say it, the flag system.<br />
<br />
As much as I admit I loathed it with an unholy passion during the early days (and it still burns me that I have to 15% into raids til I can get the Vallon Zek script to stop bugging out and finish all my flags *grin*) there are few feelings as good in EQ as getting another flag over with. I almost feel a tiny twinge of sadness that i'm one flag away from full eplanes, as few things manage to be quite as exciting as a shot at that one key flag you need to progress to another zone.<br />

<br />
Coirnav requires just about everyone involved to be on their A game.  If one of the pullers messes up and pulls the named into the crow causing a wipe, is that the fault the RNG or because the puller didn't play top form.<br />
<br />
Coirnav is a good event imho, quite a rush for 15 mins solid.  Without the (short) timer it would be like almost all other events.  <br />

RZtW is probably my favorite just for the variety it gives. I also like Coirnav for the challenge.  Not too many events in PoP where you can go into it thinking you might lose no matter how many times you've done it before. Most encounters people are on auto pilot after the 3rd or 4th time doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If not, you sound like your involved in a similar situation as all those guilds.  Finally a chance to actually find targets up and they are doable.<br />

Ashborne actually, one step up on the food chain. :) Been doing a LOT of elemental minis and such, working on eplanes gods, and backflagging on occasion.</div></div><hr />

Aoeing , named rooting , underwater pulling , non CH roations those sound like differnt types of skills to me.<br />
<br />
I Would have to disagree , the encounter can still wipe you if your named mob control isnt down etc. having a cloak means you cant Lose and try again. You lose the event your out for 3 days , thought i do agree the lose timer should be 6 hours or somthing not 3 days but anyway.<br />

The only thing that ruined it for me was listening to semi-active to non-active people complain that we didn't backflag enough. Or when people did get flagged, they'd stop participating until there was something in it for them (we were on a merit loot system, not dkp)</div></div><hr />

You know what? This is the single most problem we have right now.  We have about 6 people who will show up to help anyone regardless of being flagged, the rest couldn't care less if their guildies were flagged or not.  Its infuriating.  What's worse, is some people who need flags aren't even bothering to show now.  Going to just start moving on and when they complain, well they had ample opportunities.</div></div><hr />

Some people do get tired of backflagging, I know you may feel like they are being selfish but well.. it will happen to you too.<br />

Heh, we're on dkp and this happens too... I hate it =\</div></div><hr />

There was a quote I saw somewhere which is why I do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you view your guild as the people who you're going to see the end game with, then<br />
no raid is a waste of your time. Their gear is your gear and their fate is your fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
I do understand, however, that this isn't the general case.</div></div><hr />

However, it can be fun to try these with fewer people. We did FRo recently with like 48 people, really fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* XP is good<br />
* Raid there are fun (well more fun then 1,000,000 hp trash mobs on lucin)<br />
* There is something for everybody (hardcore raider /more casual player)<br />
<br />
I do like the flagging to. Because it gives you something to work towards. A little less flag zones would be nice but i like the idea that not everybody can enter any zone.<br />
<br />
I only disliked the fact there were so few dungeons in PoP. I like dungeon crawls</div></div><hr />

I know many people who can handle the content elemental and up but can't do it not because they are &quot;unworthy&quot; but because they never get the opportunity to kill the required mobs to get to the zones.  This, however, goes back to the argument of making progress mobs spawnable or every two hours.  No silver platters required.</div></div><hr />
