<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorda</div><div class="date">12-21-2005, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">FINALLY i got a pyrelian rage fire focus :bubbrubb2 :) :) :flowers2: , now i wonder if i should keep my burning affliction 5 aug too..<br />
 <br />
I mean .. if you cast a fire dot and have 2 focuses on the same damage..<br />
fire focus           --&gt;0% .. 35% damage<br />
burning affliction --&gt;0% .. 20% damage <br />
 <br />
are BOTH focuses rolled by the game and the best % is selected?<br />
 <br />
so for example ...<br />
 <br />
fire focus RNG selects +12%<br />
burning affliction RNG select +19%<br />
 <br />
then the burning affliction focus hits and u have an overall increase of 19% damage? Or the burning affliction focus is not considered by the game? (which seems strange, as it would involve some funny code in EQ)<br />
 <br />
If this is true, then DPS can marginally be increased by keeping both focuses working. Anyone knows? <br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
Another question ... if u cast a DOT, then you unequip the focus .. will the DOT damage be decreased in following ticks? Or the focus just takes effect at cast time?</div></div><hr />

So, You'll want to keep them both.<br />
<br />
But, Focus effects don't stack.  It will always use the focus with the highest percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">12-21-2005, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pyrilien Rage WILL focus fire DoT's; it is a focus to all fire spells. <br />
However, if you ever use anything from our magic based DoT line, then you will most likely want a BA5 or better aug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dorda</div><div class="date">12-21-2005, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well .. thank for the replies but i'll explain my question better.<br />
 <br />
If i understood well, a % focus is a random increase in damage from 0% to a max % .. so 0% to 35% for pyrelian rage.<br />
Now if i have SEVERAL similar focuses acting on the same things (fire dot for example) it it well known they the DONT add up .. <br />
yet .. <br />
 <br />
1) does the game roll the % increase for EACH focus and then select the roll with the highest %? or... <br />
2) will it statically select the best focus BEFORE rolling , then roll the %? <br />
 <br />
If 1) is true, then it should be possible to parse a 2% increase in damage when using (pyrelian rage+burning affliction5) compared to using pyrelian rage only. In case 2) there should be no difference. Difficult and boring to collect data for this .. so i hope someone knows<br />
 <br />
NOTE: i have now fire focus, magic focus AND burning affliction 5 .. so i have to decide if to drop burning affliction 5 for dots .. <br />
i have fire focus, cold focus AND improved damage 5 .. so i have to decide if to drop improved damage 5 for nukes<br />
I know they dont add up .. but the point is if a second focus statistically changes slightly the average % increase that is rolled by the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
So whatever focus is the better focus will fire when you use a spell that works with that focus.<br />
<br />
Pyrelian Rage only works with fire based spells, so it will only fire on fire based spells.<br />
<br />
Spells such as Wasp Swarm are magic based and thus some kind of focus is needed to have them tic for higher damage. The BA5 one will work for that as will http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=45717 <br />
<br />
That is a 25pct magic focus that will give you up to 5pct better on your dots and is an augment if you dont have some other item with a magic focus.<br />
<br />
BA5 is only 20pct, so you can add a bit more magic damage by swapping out your Citrine Spell Stone for Ritual Nexus Opal. <br />
<br />
Focus only works on the highest focus as far as I have seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd be very very (very!) surprised if it behaved any way other than highest % item gets calculated and that's the only one that actually gets rolled.  Go ahead and turn on focus effect messages though and cast a bunch of fire spells, see if rage is ever *not* the one emoted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aye...<br />
<br />
2) will it statically select the best focus BEFORE rolling , then roll the %? <br />
<br />
This is correct in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordien</div><div class="date">12-21-2005, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I give up on editing messages everytime I do it ends up loosing the post.<br />
 <br />
What I was saying was, I have 2 pieces of gear with different ice focus affects.  I have never done any grand tests, but to date I've only noticed the higher max% item &quot;glowing&quot; or whatever it says.  I have 2 items with identical healing focus and to date I have only ever noticed the focus on the shield being used &quot;glowing&quot;.  <br />
 <br />
So, as I take it, <br />
1) Eq checks which what the Max possible focus % at whatever casting level and selects that focus.<br />
2) If the selected focus is duplicated on other pieces of gear, it chooses which piece of gear to use by some predeterminted gear slot order.<br />
3) It determines what % focus will be applied.<br />
 <br />
But for a better test use a dot which will give you more data points since it is per tick and cast it a few times and see what the results are.</div></div><hr />

Don't know if dots give increased damage focus messages either. Only focus message I get when casting DoTs is that my Hanvar belt flickers.. it's extended duration focus.<br />
 <br />
BTW, focus messages come from the specific item that has the focus. If your focus comes from an augment, the message has augment name in it. <br />
 <br />
For example when I buff people, I get this message:<br />
&quot;Your Last Blood of the .. whatever.. glows&quot; or whatever the glow/flicker is. Even tho the last blood augment is in my GM chest piece and when I check my chest piece, it has that focus listed.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure they do every tick, or they used too.  Its been awhile since I noticed, since all that stuff is filtered to a seperate chat box I ... rarely read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aye, if there are messages I must have figured out how to filter them long ago. Now If I could figure out how to filter/or move the DS messages and all the spell casting messages from others.</div></div><hr />
