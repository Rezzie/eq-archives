So I never got the free AA.<br />
<br />
Is this something I can go back and do by myself (I think I need a key). How easy is this likely to be for a L66 druid (with camo and exodus AA's)? <br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riverwinter</div><div class="date">01-11-2007, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read thru the PoP Progression (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2638) on Allakhazam and this is what I got out of it: <br />
 <br />
Go to Seer Mal Nae`Shi in the PoK and 'unlock memories' and 'guided meditation&quot;.<br />
 <br />
If you get &quot;You have bested Aerin`Dar and proven yourself honorable enough to pass into Mithaniel's Halls.&quot; then you are HoH flagged. <br />
 <br />
If you get &quot;You have defeated Aerin`Dar but have yet to learn the true meaning of Justice.&quot; then you need to do a PoJ trial and zone in to HoH to get flagged.<br />
 <br />
Hope this helps. I don't know if a 66 Druid can solo a PoJ trial, but I know that a group of 70's fly thru them with no strain.<br />
 <br />
BTW, if anyone is doing PoP raids on Nameless, and you wouldn't mind a level 75 Druid running with you on a Saryn Raid sometime, send a PM or a tell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't solo Arien'Dar as a level 66 Druid, so you would need to run with a Arien'Dar raid to get the flag unless someone knows of another way.<br />
<br />
I had a friend with the same issue once, and even using the Key to get into AD's Lair after server up, we where unable to open the door he sits on.<br />
