<br />
If it's your first character go for Herbalism and Skinning. If it's an alt then go LW and Skinning.<br />
<br />
Um ... this would apply if this is your first toon and you are still leveling up.  As a rule of thumb I'd suggest two crafting professions for a serious raiding toon.  Gathering professions are for leveing and alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still haven't gotten a better dps chest, bracers, or belt then the Primal Strike set... Maybe i should check into what's availabe with the new badge purchases... Definitely a GREAT set available to you as soon as you have LW maxed... farming the primals can be a pain, but definitely worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So is Leatherworking and Skinning.<br />
<br />
It's just personal preference really.  Do you want to spend all your time removing the skin from animal corpses, or do you want to spend all your time picking flowers and using them to make drugs? :&gt;<br />

Later you can decide if it is worth switching to something else.  Obtaining the 100g (lvl 40) and later 600g (lvl 60) for your land mounts is difficult if you are wasting your gold on leveling LW or potions.  Once you reach the Outlands and have hit lvl 70 for sometime, you'll have so much money you won't know what to do with it.  That is a good time to buy your way into another profession (if you want).<br />
<br />
FWIW, I'm just too lazy to handle crafting professions (though I still wish I took up enchanting so I could DE the dozens of greens I get each day in the Outlands).  So, I have mining and herbalism.  Mining gives you a ton of gold for your 600g land mount, but requires quite a bit of work to reach 300 skill.  Herbs on the other hand seem to be everywhere (I had 300 skill before I was level 50 and I only gathered herbs that were &quot;in my way&quot; while leveling) but don't generate as much gold (as ore) at lower levels.<br />
<br />
Both mining and herbalism from 300-375 is very easy.<br />
<br />
I did skill LW thru 300 on my Druid (dropped it at lvl 58 for mining).  I had my lvl 70 hunter grind for the mats or purchase them off the AH.  The amount of mats and time consumed (even with a lvl 70 hunter grinding on lvl 50 mobs) to reach 300 was insane.  And the mats required to reach 375 are far, far worst (which is why I dropped it).  You will not obtain enough skins just from the mobs you kill while questing to level your LW.  Expect to spend gold (AH buys) and/or time (grinding mobs) in order to skill up LW.  Assuming you are feral, there are only a few pieces of BoP LW that worth using at lvl 70, 2-3 pieces for kitty and 1 piece for bear.  If you become a raid kitty (good for you), you can find equivalent items elsewhere (badges, AH, BoE craftables, etc.).  Here's the list (http://www.wowhead.com/?items=4.2&amp;filter=sl=16:18:5:8:11:10:23:7:21:2:22:13:24:15:28  :14:4:3:19:25:12:17:6:9;minle=90;cr=2:86:50;crs=1:  11:3;crv=0:0:0#0-2+1) of BoP end game LW items (all 8 of them!).<br />
<br />
The least effort with maximum gold (for leveling) is to take skinning and herbs.  Sell all mats on the AH (or vendor the low level stuff).  Later, if you want, drop skinning for potions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will admit, I wasn't the richest Druid growing up in Azeroth,  but having maxed out both professions simply through leveling, I had the advantage of discovering major recipes early into Outlands.  <br />
<br />
Outland herbs yield some mighty fine mats that make up some mighty fine recipes which = pure gold in the AH. ;)<br />
<br />
OH!  And I probably should mention that Agility, Wisdom, Healing, Mana, Pots and/or Elixirs are a must have for raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
started with LW / Skinning which was ok levelling and made me some money back in the old days when i could sell a blue set of leather armour that rogues used to like around lvl 52+ - cant remember its name.<br />
<br />
tried enchanting for a while but seemed to cost a lot to level and without some really good enchants i struggled to make money.<br />
<br />
now gone herby a couple months ago and whey hey herbs are selling good :)<br />
<br />
i've kept LW as i've bought and made myself a couple of epic items...Boots of Natual Grace / Hood of Primal Life and am looking ahead to being able to buy Hearts of Darkness at a price under which i feel the need to re-mortgage the house ;) and then another couple of high level recipes like the Swiftstrike Shoulders (?)<br />
<br />
however i keep being tempted to drop LW now and just get into Alchemy which from talking to people is a money make esp with these new 'discoveries' and mastery's you can now do ???<br />
<br />
there are also some very very good and useful profession levelling guides on the official forums but atm i cannot get through the darn firewall to link to them !</div></div><hr />
