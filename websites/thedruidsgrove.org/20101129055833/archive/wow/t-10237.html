<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">03-13-2006, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so I've been hitting the BGs pretty hard the last few weeks, mainly AV as I find it to be a LOT more fun than AB and WSG ( also helps that in AV people seem more willing to work as a team or maybe that's just the lvls now, I'm not sure ) and have felt that my PvP abilites were getting better, if only marginally.  I couldn't really get a feel for it though as in AV it's rarely one on one, so it's really hard to quantify anything.  <br />
<br />
A few of my guild members and I were down in Blasted Lands doing some questing when this NE rogue ( lvl 58 and I'm 56 ) ( PvE server &amp; we are alliance too ) starts following us around.  After about 10 min he challanges one of my party members to a duel, they decline ( most of my guild members are not big PvPers ).  Then he challenged me.  I buff up, accept, go cat and stealth.  He got the jump on me unfortunately, but I got FF on him a few combo points up and got him bleeding with rake.  Shifted out, Natures Grasped myself, he hit me, got rooted ( then said &quot;???&quot; ), I regrowth, cast moonfire and went bear.  I just tore him down at this point.  I still had over 3/4 of my hp when all was said and done. <br />
<br />
I want to thank those here for all they have helped me with, when it comes to PvP and non PvP stuff.</div></div><hr />

I've been doing AV and AB a lot recently too, as I am horribly bored with grinding through UD strat for my kilt, Scholo for my headpiece, and LBRS for the shoulders, or grinding for essences for the Hide of the Wild.<br />

Sounds like a solid strategy that you have with the NG and all.  Do you have Natures Swiftness?  I love nothing more than fighting someone till about 20% health, popping out and instantly healing myself back to full, throwing an improved rejuv on myself and getting back into bear form, then watching their jaw drop b/c I'm at full health, half mana and in bear form.  Lol.</div></div><hr />

I hit 56 this weekend and need to start grinding my rep with Timbermaw to get the patterns for those nice leather items they have.  I'm not at war with them anymore, but have a LONG way till I'm friendly. *sigh*</div></div><hr />
