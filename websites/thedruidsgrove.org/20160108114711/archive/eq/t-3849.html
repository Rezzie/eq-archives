I know we often add people to moderate specific forums without any real notice to the community.  Also, since a lot of questions have been popping up on exactly how we moderate things, hopefully this will help clear up some of those questions.<br />
<br />
First off, here is your staff:<br />
Board Admins:  Sobe, Stormhaven<br />
Board-wide Moderators:  Scirocco, Tweil, Salicia, Cassea, Aidon<br />
Limited Moderators:<br />
Xiggin (Hunting Guide, Quests, OT, Rants, Equipment, PVP)<br />
FyyrLuStorm (Equipment, Polls, Hunting Guide, OT, Rants, PVP)<br />
<br />
During the next few days (weeks?) I've asked the other Moderators to reply and give a short insight into their moderating style.  If you have any questions for us, feel free to ask in this thread.  If you just want to call us names or flame us, take it to Rants.  Posts of that nature in this thread will be edited :P</div></div><hr />

General Mod Info/Style:<br />
I am a big pro-discussion buff.  I like threads where there's good communication going on, and in those threads I'm willing to go a little easy on the &quot;flaming&quot; rules as long as there's constructive information contained therein.  My server's discussion forum is nothing but a big cauldron of flames, so my perception of a rant or flame is probably a little more lenient because of it.  I have no patience for trolls, ads, whiners, flamers, spammers or anything of the like.  My definition of a &quot;troll&quot; is a person who comes in, posts one word/sentence quips in every posts and leaves.  Or someone who argues only for the sake of arguing (ie: no substance).  Any of the above will find their threads/replies deleted, and banned in relatively short order.<br />
<br />
I am tough on personal attacks - I don't feel there's any room in the forums for that kind of behavior. However, just because someone called you an &quot;idiot&quot; doesn't quite qualify as a personal attack to me. I'm a big stickler on sigs - keep their size within the forum guidelines and we won't have a problem. Otherwise you'll probably find your post edited and your sig removed.<br />
<br />
Personality-wise, I feel I've been playing EQ for long enough that I know not to have a knee-jerk reaction to either players or VI. I'm pretty laid back when it comes to changes and will test things out before forming an opinion on whether I like it or not (as opposed to forming an opinion based purely by other people's feedback alone).  I like to think I'm pretty open-minded about other classes' opinions, but it takes a good solid discussion to make me change my own perceptions, since I base them on what I've personally experienced.  My current perception of a druid is that while we aren't as good as we could be with a few small changes, we're not as &quot;broken&quot; as others seem to think we are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have just recently joined a new Tier 1 guild having been in non-ranked guilds (yeah yeah we sucked LOL) for years. As such I tend to speak more for the casual player and I'm very pro-Roleplay.<br />
<br />
Although I am level 60 with a few AA-points under my belt my equipment is average at best consisting of mostly UP with a few upgrades here and there. I've never had more than 10k to my name and average about 1k in the bank. As such I tend to speak more for the poor Druids. *smiles*<br />
<br />
I love a good debate. I think I'm right most of the time *rolls eyes* but I can be convinced otherwise if you make your case. I tend to be VERY sarcastic which is not a good thing as sarcasm does not translate well into text which is why you'll often see my text littered with *smiles* or other such indications about the way my posts should be read.<br />
<br />
I love to play devil's advocate in order to get people to see both sides. In my eyes the true sense of a good debate is if you are able to easily post on either side of the discussion. I like when statements are based upon facts and when people do their homework.<br />
<br />
I also look at posters history to see what they are about if a matter is in a grey area. I visit other class boards - mostly Wizards and Clerics - to learn about the two play styles that are closest to Druids abilities and will post there if I feel I have something constructive to add.<br />
<br />
I love to explore Norrath and spend much more time doing nothing or sitting in a newbie area buffing then leveling.<br />
<br />
I research everything I can get about the zones/mobs and am VERY into computer hardware/upgrades.<br />
<br />
I am married with two children, two jobs and live in Chicago.<br />
<br />
Have I said enough? Too much? *smiles*</div></div><hr />

Hmm...well I dunno really...I haven't been a mod for all that long ;) .<br />
<br />
If I think you're trolling...I'll edit and boot your post without much of a second thought.<br />
<br />
If you aren't part of the community here and start in with the flame thrower on full blast...I'll edit your post without much of a second thought.<br />
<br />
If you ever post anything deragatory about sheep...I'll just get Sobe to ban you.<br />
<br />
Other than that I'm pretty laid back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SilleyEskimo</div><div class="date">09-17-2002, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice idea.  Maybe there should be a thread like this for all the regulars.  I would like to find out more about sorrun, Tuda, and many other long time posters.<br />
<br />
Does Inny qualify as a tier 1 encounter?  I would think that mre tier 3 or so since he has been upgraded, but he's still an old Norrath MoB.  I would eaisly rank him below Vindi, Velk, and other tier 2 encounters.  Just curious what the concensus is on that ;) <br />
<br />
Anyway, good thread.<br />

Good idea... maybe I will start one in a bit if nobody else does.<br />

As for what happened to Fox... after reading Aidon's post, maybe she made fun of sheep... :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiggin</div><div class="date">09-18-2002, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the past 6-8 weeks EQ has taken a giant backseat to RL issues.  I just cut my sabbatical short. It was great to spend lots of time with the family and &quot;wasting&quot; tons of time and resources on games and pet projects.  However, being passive in my own companies started to become very annoying.  So, I am back at work, albeit very differently than before.<br />
<br />
I still would have plenty of time to play EQ but I have lost almost all interest in both the game and the forums.  The discussions, at the DG, regarding the changes in experience between Level 50 and 60 were especially saddening to read.  I do not recall ever seeing so much misinformation and so much misguided bitching being posted.  For me, this was a lowpoint.   <br />
<br />
Anyhow, I will still be around whenever new challenges reappear. But, for the time being, I rather take it easy and give it some time to change my attitude towards the game and its ancillary subjects.</div></div><hr />

I was a mod for quite some time...circa late 1999 till  your recent cull.  Yes, I stopped playing EQ but I was quite effective in removing the spams as I tended to visit several times a day.<br />
