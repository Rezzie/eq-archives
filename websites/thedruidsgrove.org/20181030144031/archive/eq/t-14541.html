 <br />
I have read the lists of changes to the game with each expansion, etc...  But I have not been able to find a thread or webpage that explains the basics about how to USE the expansions.  For example, The PoP zones are tiered (I think).  How do you start the progression?  With a new character able to get into PoJ, etc., what does someone do to start this for future raids?<br />
 <br />
Also, I'd like to know how to use the PoR expansions?  Is there a starting point?  What about LDoN?  Starting point for that one?  <br />
 <br />
If someone knows of a good summary (hopefully, short) that explains this, I'd love to know about it!<br />
 <br />
Thanks!<br />

P.S.:  To give you an example of what I need, and to show that I don't need too much detail, I'm looking for something like this:<br />
&quot;Planes of Power progression starts with a level 46 character going to _______ and hailing him.  He will give you a short quest that will 'flag' your character to enter the Plane of Growth.&quot;   Not that this quote is correct (I have no idea what the process is), but I just need the basics.  Something like this for the different &quot;endgame&quot; areas of the expansions would be great!</div></div><hr />

After literally hours of searching, I found a site (Samanna's Reference Desk) that outlines the big picture on ALL of these expansions.  http://samanna.net<br />
 <br />
It's a daunting amount of information, but it is also encouraging.  The higher level zones were created to give endgamers more content and room to have fun.  It's nice to know that when I get my druid to that level, she'll have LOTS of play time ahead of her!<br />

I'm sure a lot of druids here use that site, including me, extensively.</div></div><hr />
