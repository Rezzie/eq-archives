You can get a normal / hard version and I have not encountered anything that summons. I normally snare / evac to split groups and then just root / dot.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I have done - hard version as well as The Spies like Us mission. As far as the nest goes - no summoning mobs in the beginning part that I remember - good experience there as well.<br />

Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Just to collect mammoth tusks when I was doing Wraithguard faction, I charm fought the roaming mammoths south of the glacier, that are charmable with beast's beckoning.  Was no trouble to clear every roaming mammoth before repop, that's a lot more than you could kill using root/DOT or nuke kiting.  Experience was mediocre since I was doing it at L75, and they were all blue, but I'd bet that spot would be about the best solo exp spot around for a druid at L71.</div></div><hr />
