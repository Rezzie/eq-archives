I've seen 100g for 100mp/hp on my server, but I don't see +8 one stat very often.  <br />

I'd appretiate any thoughts, thanks! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">06-05-2006, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the quest you are referring to is the one that uses the Libram of Voracity. The items needed are:<br />
<br />
Black Diamond x1<br />
Libram of Voracity x1<br />
Crystal Force x4<br />
Whipper Root Tubers x4<br />
<br />
Depends on your server, but on Bloodhoof the Black Diamonds go for 20-30g. The Crystal Force is BoP, but super easy to get, will take you 30 mins tops to get the crystals necessary for it. Whipper Root Tubers are gonna take some time to get, but not too bad. I carry a stack with me all the time since they are on a seperate timer from healing pots. The Libram itself will probably be the biggest expense (not counting the 30g needed to do the turn-in) so it just depends on your server's prices. Of all the libram quests this is probably the easiest though, so really it's just a question of convenience. If I had spare gold I would probably pay 100g, but certainly no more than that.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday I saw a rogue offering:<br />
<br />
Constitution (+100 HP) for 100g<br />
Resilience (+20 FR) for 250g<br />
<br />
So depending on the market of your server you could get anywhere from 75g-100g for +8 stat<br />
<br />
Libram of Voracity 5g-20g (my server is flakey)<br />
Black Diamond 25-40g<br />
<br />
The rest of the stuff is farmable solo<br />
<br />
I still go on Stealth Coffer runs.  I have 10 Black Bloods, 2 eyes and 6 fire essences.  My guilides just send me the Crystals, black diamond, libram and 30g and I get the Libram done ahead of time.</div></div><hr />

It has dropped some in value as people want the ZG enchants for their new found epic legs and helmets.</div></div><hr />
