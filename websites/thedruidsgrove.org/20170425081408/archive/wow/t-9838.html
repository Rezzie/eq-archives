<br />
1) How did you spend the 21 talent points in Resto tree?<br />
<br />
2) Have you been able to do raids with this build? Most forum threads that I've read are along the lines of &quot;no resto/innervate, no invite&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Just want to get a feel for how this build holds up as a healer in these large raids (with the right healing/caster gear on).</div></div><hr />

<br />
    Improved Mark of the Wild (5/5)<br />
    Improved Healing Touch (5/5)<br />
    Nature's Focus (5/5)<br />
    Tranquil Spirit (5/5)<br />
    Nature's Swiftness (1/1)<br />
<br />
<br />
2)  I'm not raiding just yet, but my guild understands that feral druids with ns and ts can heal just fine.  They wont necessarily be the best healer on the raid, or healing the MT, but as a backup healer 0/30/21 druids are solid.  <br />
<br />
If you are raiding with PuG's, I'd suggest finding a good guild that has a few high ranking druids in it, with at least one druid being an officer.  That'll ensure that at least someone in the guild knows what a druid can do, and will allow you to play how you are best.  If you are an alchemist and can make some big mana pots (recipie in scholo I think) then you dont really need innervate.  And if their priests are relying on innervate, well, the priests need to learn to heal more efficiently, or get better gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 2 - You must take Improved Healing Touch<br />
<br />
Tier 3 - Most go for Nature's Focus.  Some will split points between Reflection, Insect Swarm, Subtlety, and Improved Enrage as well.<br />
<br />
Tier 4 - You must take Tranquil Spirit.  If you're using rejuv all the time to spot heal you are a grossly inefficient healer.<br />
<br />
Tier 5 - Nature's Swiftness is too good to pass up.<br />
<br />
You raid healing could should include reflection, insect swarm, and Imp. MotW, sacrificing Nature's Focus and Furor respectively.  That's your feral/resto tradeoff.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend +healing gear and +mana/5 gear.  Wear it even if it's cloth.  Spam low-rank HT.<br />
<br />
BRD/LBRS/Scholo/Strath/UBRS raids will accept you.  Ony/MC/BWL/ZG raids are much more picky.</div></div><hr />

This works for the most part but you have to know that you're in a situation that's going to tax your mana beforehand.  Even if you are an alchemist the herbs are somewhat uncommon and the AH is expensive.  I don't think people use all the mana tricks they could.<br />
<br />
Weapons and trinkets can be changed mid-battle.  Many do not use this to their advantage.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Create</div><div class="date">01-04-2006, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reflection doesn't really payoff until your the encounters are very long.  HT should be your primary healing spell on raids.  Tranquility gives you 10% mana efficiency and that is is huge.<br />
<br />
There are four core healing talents for long encounters:  Improved HT (increases your output by about 14%), Tranquil Spirit (decreases mana cost by 10%), Gift of Nature (increases healing by 10%), and Reflection (increases regen by a small amount).  You can get 3 with a 21 point build.  <br />
<br />
Full restoration builds get the extra 10% from GoN.  Gear being equal you'll outlast full restoration builds with a 0/30/21.  They have 10% from GoN.  You have 20% more mana from HotW.<br />
<br />
Innervate, even if assigned to a priest, increases the value of resto builds beyond that of a 0/30/21 in a healing role.  If there's little risk (no AoE) and you're out of mana tricks, get in cat and dps while you regen.  Bear while not tanking will is dangerous.  The extra AC won't help much and an accidental growl often means death.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was only saying imp motw for raid purposes.  For everything else, go with furor.  I love innervate.  I have played as both resto and feral, and though I am currently feral (for the 50-60 trek and the pure fun of it), I very much respect the increased healing abilities, and awesome power of innervate, and believe that resto druids do offer more to raids than feral.  <br />
<br />
Lol the pots that I make now are incredibly expensive if you were to buy the mats from the ah, but all the places I'm questing / grinding have enough of the herbs that I need to make plenty of pots for my personal use, and enough to distribute to my raiding guildies.  I can see that it would be a huge pain to go collect these herbs if you didn't have any reason to quest / grind in the area.</div></div><hr />
