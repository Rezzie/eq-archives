<br />
Don't worry so much about gear right now, at least IMO.  I'd worry more about leveling and just getting quest reward gear.  It's not perfect for tanking, but you won't find any of that gear really until later on.  Focus on saving for your mount(s) and worry not about completing tanking/dps/whatever gear for levels that you will replace them again VERY shortly.</div></div><hr />

It is definitely a pain to have to go back.</div></div><hr />

Imo, don't bother leveling Alchemy until you hit 70 because it's a waste of time and a gold sink..neither of which you can afford if you want to hit the level cap as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Normally I'd go back to leveling crafting professions after I have enough money/have hit max level.<br />
<br />
You could always contemplate picking up skinning and dropping it @ 70 back for Alchemy too~<br />
<br />
Grind on turtle mobs (they have most expensive vendor trash). Especially the ones in Tanaris (around 41-44ish so a bit off but you'll get there).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awe poor druid, dont worry :&gt;  Druids grove is a nice place for druids, lots of halp and advise here :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
There are many ways to make money.  Using your professions is one route, but as you've said you're mainly focusing on getting experience just now, so it would be good if we can find a way to help you make money that also involves gaining experience.<br />
<br />
So I have 3 suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. One of the best and fastest ways to make money is to run lots of instances with only people you know and trust.<br />
<br />
Whenever I go on an instance run with someone I don't know, I always look at how they perform and if they seem competent and play well I add them to my friends list in case I want to contact them to come to an instance again later.<br />
<br />
Over time this means you build up a friends list full of nice people who are also good players.  If you try to always build up the core of your groups from these people, the instance will usually go well.  This results in those people associating you with smooth instance runs, and hey presto, you have a reputation for being an awesome, professional player.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
You make lots of money from doing this, and the experience from doing instances is great.  :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. At level 35 you should also check out a zone called Shimmering Flats, which is right next to Tanaris.<br />
It's a pain to get to, but the quests there are great - you can pick them all up, spend an hour completing them, then hand them in again and gain a level's worth of experience.<br />
It also gives you some great prequests for Stranglethorn Vale, a very large zone that is suitable for level 30-45.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3.  Find a good mage - preferably an arcane or a frost mage, although any mage will do.  Group with them and get them to aoe some mobs (ie using spells like frost nova, arcane explosion, etc) - you can help by healing them, casting hurricane, and going bear form to taunt mobs off them and back into the &quot;pack&quot;.  It's best to just heal until you are fully comfortable with each others' playstyles.<br />
<br />
If you practice a bit with the mage, you can make thousands upon thousands of exp per hour, absolutely loads of money, and also feel kinda like Keanu Reaves for bending the rules of the matrix and killing 1234909923 mobs at once ;)<br />
<br />
At your level a really great place to go AOE'ing is Go'Shek Farm, which is east a bit from the main alliance camp in Arathi Highlands.  The mobs there are only melee - no ranged or casters - and they are already tightly clumped which makes them ideal for aoe'ing :&gt;<br />
<br />
Once you're too high level for that place, another good one to try is the slimes around the river that runs through The Hinterlands.  Those mobs also drop an item called [Ooze Covered Bag] which can contain large amounts of money, potions, and other cool stuff.<br />
<br />
Let us know how you get on :&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">11-30-2007, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">way back in the day, before anyone stepped into Molten Core, when I was level 35 and getting ready for the grind to my level 40 mount, I spent a lot of time grinding. The old grinds aren't nearly as good as they used to be. These days, your best bets are probably:<br />
<br />
Herbs: Players who are powerleveling alchemy pay handsomely. Just watch the AH and figure out which ones to get.<br />
<br />
Leather: consider dropping alchemy to get skinning. You're killing stuff already, why not skin it for the money? Again, people powerleveling leatherworking pay obscene amounts for leather. Be patient and try to not undercut people to keep the price stable until someone makes a run on the AH.<br />
<br />
Grind humanoid type mobs for cloth, especially wool and above. Wool always sells well and fast and clothes above that obey the same laws as leather: Keep the price stable and wait for someone powerleveling tailoring. You have to kill lots of mobs that drop cloth in places like stranglethorn anyway, so it's not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Find a friend who can Disenchant items for free. Bring him your greens and get them DE'd. Once you get past strange dust and magic essence, the enchanting materials will usually sell very well.</div></div><hr />
