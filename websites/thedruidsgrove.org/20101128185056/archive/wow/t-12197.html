<br />
Concerning my post : i'm a Druid class leader and currently looking for cross-realm resto druids recruitment. My question to you is this : would it be ok to post a thread with the recruitment? I mean i looked as best as i could for a space to post the announcement and would love it for instance if there was a topic concerning recruitments for our class specifically for cross-realm. I didn't want to start a new thread and just splat the announcement there but instead getting the green light for it first. If there is such a topic and i didn't notice it please direct me to it. I must apologise but i don't have too much time to browse from work.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, I remember reading somewhere that recruiting here is ok, as long as it stays reasonable and people don't start posting a lot of those.</div></div><hr />

Aye sorry about that, will edit the post now. I was merely sugesting it would be nice if such a Topic existed, &quot;Cross-Realm Recruitment&quot;.</div></div><hr />
