So, I might just take the lazy way out and do cat-bear.<br />

wow, that is gonna be such a buff to feral dps, and taht primal gore gore talent with lacerate being able to crit will be incredible i think with savage Defense<br />

<br />
the change of savage roar gives about the same damage-boost to white damage as before. <br />
we'll see if crit makes up for the damage-boost through SR. but i think it will.<br />
<br />
@Goose:<br />
I think AGI will be less viable than it is now. <br />
The change in SR goes to physical damage, which is increased through STR the most.<br />
And we are already over 50% crit raidbuffed.<br />
So i wouldnt focus any more on AGI/CRIT.<br />
<br />
Savage Defense i dont like.<br />
Or i dont like the fact, that the whole shield is gone after one hit. And it doesnt matter it its a 5k hit or a 100 hit....<br />
For boss tanking it will be a win, but for trash we will take a lot more damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree...Also, think of encounters like Patchwerk.  He hits at an incredible speed (~1 sec) the fastest we can hit is ~2 secs with haste, so we have to crit every single time to get less mitigation than we had before.  <br />
<br />
I hope I am misunderstanding this talent...or we are getting nerfed into no longer being a viable tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
U are wrong about that. We hit about every second.<br />
Maul every 2-2.5 sec.<br />
Lacerate-Ticks every 2 secs.<br />
Swipe or Lacerate every 1.5 sec.<br />
And with Lacerate beeing able to crit with 3.1. <br />
I'm at around 35% crit in bear so aprox. i would get the shield about every 3-4 secs. It might be pretty good on bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
@sergio, the change in SR means it doesnt' just increase AP any more. so strenght isn't necessarily the only stat. So the new question is increasing your dps by a flat 16srength (buffed 45ap?) or increasing by a scaling factor of 16 agil (.25% crit?). Now at some point this these to graphed function cross and crit becomes more valuable. under the old system i remember reading something like they crossed at approximately 12.5kap, however under this new system I'm betting that graph has been shifted significantly. You also mentioned a good point, our crit is already pretty high. because of mechanics of glancing blows, we're always going to glance, not crit 25% of our blows. so at some point crit becomes less and less good. I don't know this number at all but i would say its atleast higher than 60%. At this point it might be good to switch to another scaling factor such as armor pen? I'm not sure if it will or not since armor pen doesn't help our bleeds, but it sounds better than haste on a kitty.</div></div><hr />

This. Honestly, anytime I ran an instance pre-60, it was as a healer with an entirely feral build, and a decent healing set. I can't really imagine anyone needing to change their spec as a make-or-break situation for an instance.<br />
<br />
I just now saw the change to Maim... NOT a fan :( it was an advantage that i thouroughly enjoyed, once i learned how to time it... The other night i absolutely kaPWNED a warrior timing my maims just right... This was right after my rogue team mate and i discovered how to beat a (sloppy) pally/warrior combo in arena.</div></div><hr />

The bear tank in our guild, (i've gone strictly dps) from what i've seen, hasn't had a single issue with mitigation. Not one. If i had *my* choice, i'd be inclined to give up a little armor for some magic mitigation, both on boss fights, and in PvP...<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
just saw this: *New Spell* Savage Defense, 1 rank, level 40 - Each time you deal a melee critical strike, you gain Savage Defense, reducing the damage taken from the next physical attack that strikes you by 25% of your attack power.<br />

Really gets me mad, I work so hard to raise my armor then nerf, then work hard again and now may loose half of my armor, this is bull!<br />

I saw a screen shot of someone on the PTR vs Live (some EJ thread).  He had 32K (?) on live and only 26k(?) on the PTR.  The net loss was ~6200 armor.<br />

Unfortunately, the PTR does not have SD enabled.  So, we are all guessing about whether it provides enough help to overcome the 20% loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, 25% of AP is not that much reduction.  6200 armor is far more mitigation to physcial attacks than 25% of AP and armor is constent.  Say a bear is ~6k Ap raid buffed(generous), that is a reduction of 1500 incoming dmg, oh, and only if you just landed a crit, safe to say &lt;50% of the time.  <br />
<br />
Only time will tell.  What starts on the PTR is almost never what makes it live, so I have hope blizz will see the gaping flaw in their theory.</div></div><hr />

its more than 20 percent armor. all the armor modifiers are multiplied together, so the final armor product is being cut by 33%. My armor on live is approximately 34kish, PTR i'm down to 25.7k armor.</div></div><hr />

No, it is about 20%.  133/166 = .8 (80%).  Though your number is ~25% loss, so maybe I have the math wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have to agree.  Pally's and DK's are currently better tanks than druids, so I not sure how we got painted with the bullseye for the nerf hammer.<br />
<br />
They both mitigate or avoid better than druids, and have godly 360 degree aggro.</div></div><hr />

It is about scaling better with gear.  And giving Druids more stats to watch besides armor, agi and +sta.  That is blizzard's goal.  And, believe it or not, the Druid community has asked for this since August (in many cases the exact same changes that are being proposed).  So, for the most part, Blizzard is listening to the end users.  Though it has taken them some time to get around to doing the work.<br />
<br />
FWIW, I sort of like swipe.  But if they could boost self-cast'd thorns a bit (change the thorns glyph??)???  That would help with the 360 issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no matter what Blizz do every class will always watch some stats as priorities and then rank the others lower....no one can watch and stack all stats as priority 1.  so if we dont watch ar/agi/sta we'll watch something else for a few months til they change us again ?<br />
<br />
but what they seem to be doing with this (nerf) is not replacing a proposed reduction to our armour ( so soon after a previous change - which has i thought worked out well ?) that will allow us to keep pace with the other tank classes.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard could change our agi to crit ratio?  Change the AP percentage used in SD, change the SotF numbers, what affect does the new Primal Gore talent have on this change?, etc.<br />
<br />
Druids asked that armor not be their #1 stat, Druids did not want to reach the armor cap, Druids wanted offensive stats to convert into a defensive stat/ability.  That's what Blizzard is doing.<br />
<br />
Why do you think they gave us Barkskin and FI?  Druids wanted more &quot;buttons to push&quot;.<br />

I believe Blizz. wants Druids not to tank anymore so there Big DK can take top billing (Hero class). <br />
We need our armor to stay the same and stam. Our aggro doesn't compare to any other tanking class, yet we get nerfed, seems real odd to me.<br />
Does Blizz want to the druid class to be just healing and boomkin.<br />
<br />
I remember back when Blizz said we are splitting up the bear and cat talents so if you want to dps you can do as much as a rogue. I believe we aren't even close to rogue dps in cat!<br />
Then if you spec bear you can tank as well as a warrior or DK, I believe we can't.<br />

Agreed, but I play a hunter too.  We got nerfed, and deserve another to be honest.  Explosive shot is OP.  My first main was a mage (&lt;TBC era), so I can say without hesitation that Druids don't know the meaning of Nerf Bat as of yet.  Kitty's atm will hands down out DPS a rogue, and rogues have a right to QQ about that (They are the mages of WotLK)  Bears atm do under perform other tanks in all things expect Physical mitigation and HP pools.  So the nerf/change coming seems to be the result of druids not be happy with our simplicity.  I absolutley take the, &quot;if its not broke, don't fix it&quot; attitude, but Blizz feels differently.  <br />

Our server is overrun with DK's atm.  Hunters are rare at 80, but abondent in the 70-79 range (hard to not want a 5k DPSer).  A crappy DK will beat a good player in most classes head to head.  That is just the reality of the class design.  (They are very much like the ferals of ol', able to tank and DPS well with one spec)  In the end, the changes are in PTR and will go live regardless, but I have to take the side that they are unneeded if not unfair.</div></div><hr />

Espeically if they can do 2 roles with one spec.<br />
<br />
I admit there were plenty of DKs a couple of months ago, they just seem to have faded away on my server.  At least it seems like it.  Maybe they are all doing PvP (BGs, Arenas, WG, etc.), which I never do anymore<br />
<br />
I've also noticed very few Rogues, but then on my PvE server, rogues were sort of rare.  I have to wonder if all of our rogues and hunters became DKs?!?!?  Would be interesting to see those stats...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really.  Ok, let's look back through the years.  Prior to 1.4, there essentially were no &quot;Feral Druids.&quot;  The Feral tree was utterly hideous.  Even if you leveled in catform, you had more points in Restoration than anywhere else, because the Resto talents were better for damage output in cat/bear than the Feral talents were.  Whatever Feral talents there were, with only a couple exceptions, benefitted either cat OR bear form.<br />
<br />
Between 1.4 and the end of vanilla WoW, we actually made pretty solid tanks for instances, even though there was essentially no gear for us, outside the odd 1 or 2 drops from Naxx.  The Druid tier sets were solely for Restoration, offering a minor benefit to Balance, and nothing for Feral.  To tank, you used a level 43 world-drop item which never improved, and if you were lucky, someone could craft you the molten leather pieces which had armor and fire resist but no other stats.  With this setup, we did okay through MC/BWL when we hit the armor cap, but then stopped scaling altogether.  There was simply no cat gear available, and Cat DPS wasn't even a serious option at any level.<br />
<br />
Now, there WAS a surge when the start of BC came out, and we got pruned back, but Druids were good tanks -- so good that the top dungeons in the expansion got a pervasive effect so we wouldn't be the only option available.  Not to mention, Feral DPS -- which was okay and Feral Tank all fit in to a single spec.<br />
<br />
Again, we got pruned back at the start of Wrath, but in this case, most of it came before the game was even released, so I have trouble taking that seriously, either.<br />
<br />
Look, they've done some irritating and to my eyes, dumb things along the way.  But Feral is light years ahead of where it was &quot;years back&quot; and has gone from an inconceivable joke to weak offspec to a serious power option.  If that's a nerf, whack me some more with that nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

We had a fair number of rogues in TBC, but WotLK has killed them.  In guild we had 2 that just left the game, one of the reasons being their characters becoming un-needed.<br />
<br />
Obviously Rogues are PVP minded folks, so I would assume a fair number migrated to WarHammer too.</div></div><hr />

Yep. I'm on par with our rouges. About 4.5k DPS (max. 5k).<br />
But it depends on Encounter.<br />
On movement encounters i do a bit less than rouges, cause combat-rogues dont require to stand behind the mob.</div></div><hr />

I was tanking Maex in my stam gear, and once she enraged, I popped my trinkets/FR....etc.  With everything popped, and full raid buffed, I was at 49.5k armor (75% mit/capped)  56.5% dodge, and 67.5k+ health.  <br />
<br />
I think when you look at our numbers unbuffed and out of combat we are a completely different beast.  I guess an armor nerf may not be all that obsurd.  I didn't realize that there were buffs out there that would stack our armor so high now.  After talking with guildies a bit, it sounds like most of my armor boost came from a Shammy ability.  <br />
<br />
I sit at about ~35k armor / 32k HP / 38.5% dgd unbuffed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it was with the armor buff from the healers &amp; Indes Potion.<br />
<br />
Yes, its temporary.  But I think you always have to consider the cooldowns.  In most cases, educated use of cooldowns is the difference between average tanks and excellent ones.<br />
<br />
The addition of Barkskin and SI while in bear form was in direct response to the fact that druids lacked cooldowns, and that made us undesirable.  <br />
<br />
For Example, I cycle through Barkskin and 2 dodge trinkets while fighting Patchwerk.  I save SI/FR for the &quot;Oh Shizzle&quot; situation, but a tank saving the other CD's is putting a lot of undue stress on their healers.  <br />
<br />
Also, near the end of any boss fight, I pop all my cooldowns.  It just makes life a bit easier on healers that are likely already stressed, as well as heads off any potential disaster that can ensue in the last ~5% or so.</div></div><hr />

Kitty buffed.<br />
<br />
It's not a major patch unless druid tanking gets nerfed.<br />
<br />
The kitty buffage is very nice, but a bit worrisome. I'm one of only a handful of druids I know whose primary spec is feral dps. That's partly out of choice, partly out of demand. I'm always one of the top damage producers, and I've always been told &quot;we don't want you as tank (or moonkin, or resto) because we don't want to lose your dps.&quot; <br />
<br />
Problem is, I can take aggro from almost any tank I've met. Clicking cower is a mandatory part of my rotation. If I'm not running with vigilance, I wait until 4 sunders are up before I engage and even then I have to stop attacking during most fights to avoid getting aggro. <br />
<br />
I appreciate the increased dps, but it likely means I'll stop running heroics because it's just going to be a nightmare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not your fault. It's the tanks fault.<br />
Every decent tank can hold aggro easily on bossfights.<br />
<br />
And while raiding, all rogues and hunters push the MT at the beginning.<br />
This is mostly enough to help him built up his rotations.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, you can use moonfire, but then you will end up OOM very quickly with all that shifting.  Plus if you are like me, there is no room on my bars for caster junk when I am shifted!  :nerd: <br />

The pain for druids is we have to stack combo points to get the maim off.  Other classes have instant incapicitates (or stuns)  <br />
<br />
Not sure if its just me or not, but if I have 4+ combo points stacked, there is a good chance that I can kill the opponent with a FB rather than trying to stun with Maim.  <br />
<br />
When I pounce, Rip, Mangle, Maim....most mobs are at 30%-40% Health.  Seems more beneficail to just FB and end it, rather than dealing with all the risk of stuns (DR/Trinkets...etc)</div></div><hr />

This wont work if your oponent has 800+ resilence.<br />
They take a lot less damage.<br />
<br />
And what do you do if the oponent is not dead after FB?<br />
With maim u have more time to built up CP again and then finish.<br />
Or switch to bear for a charge-cyclone combo.</div></div><hr />

Well, can't say I often run into folks with 800+ resil.  And if I do, I have far bigger issues to deal with than maim v FB.  (like my complete lack of PvP skillz!)<br />
<br />
What do I do if they are not dead after FB?  The same thing I do if they are not dead after maim...keep hitting.  My point being by the time I maim or FB, my energy is dead either way.  So tiger's fury is gonna have to happen regardless which I use.  I favor burst damage over stun, but as stated above, my pvp skills are &quot;subpar&quot; putting it gently.   :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Swipe<br />
We are going to take another look at Swipe. Since we are trying to fix some problems where druids are too good at tanking it seems reasonable to also look at cases where they struggle.<br />
<br />
Please don't follow this up a dozen threads that say &quot;My class needs compensation for nerfs too!&quot; We generally don't offer compensation for nerfs since they are supposed to be nerfs. But in this case we are trying to realize our goal of having 4 viable MT classes and druid AE threat generation is cumbersome.<br />

Swipe works fine now, what else do I need?<br />
<br />
The only time I think that swipe fails is due to latency issues.  Which compounds the positional requirements of swipe.  This happens during the computer &quot;event&quot; in HoS (or is in HoL? I get those confused all the time).  The elite mobs come running in and you swipe one, but for some odd reason the other two get past you, so you have to turn around, which means you might lose the first one to healer/dps threat...And it gets worst as the event goes on.  I have tanked it, but it would be nice if I had a 15s cooldown AoE &quot;snap&quot; threat generation.<br />
<br />
Other than that one scenario, I don't see any issues with swipe.  Any one else?  I haven't done all of Naxx, so maybe there is something in Naxx???<br />
<br />
A similar thing happens sometimes in hVH when the patrol packs come.  I swipe the first one (the mob on my screen that appears to be first), but the other 2-3 run by me.  I guess I could have missed, but it happens too often to be from a miss.  We always recover, but I sort of look stupid at least once in each hVH run.  Could be trigger happy AoE DPS??</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like a non taunt ability that some 360 degree damage though.  When you charge in, you never know what position you will be facing.  <br />
<br />
Or when getting bounced around in the spider wing by the trash, a weak 360 ability to at least allow threat over incoming heals would be appreciated.  <br />
<br />
In the end it is definatley possible to MT just how it is, and that is true for every tanking class.  (except maybe Sarth +3/cant say from personal experience)</div></div><hr />

Random untested idea that came to me while at work:<br />
<br />
/targetenemy<br />
/swipe (or /cast swipe whatever)<br />

Something like that? I think if you don't use the [noharm] option it would just target the closest NPC.</div></div><hr />

Not a bad thought, except normally even when my primary focus is temporarily out of range, I still want to focus on one mob rather than bouncing around.  Also, the more macro savy single target DPSers like to start their attacks with /tar focus, /assist, /cast spam....So if I am changing targets on everyswipe, so are they and for most that could be bad.  Debuffs usually stack per cast and changing target will make them angry :)</div></div><hr />

Really, if they just gave us some type of bear slam/stomp that would do 10-15yd AoE threat boost with a 15-20s cooldown, the weird latency and positional issues of swipe would not be an issue.<br />

I have spent years getting them too.  This eliminates them selecting targets of their own accord.  What is the downside?  Even if you tab target (an outdated practice) they are right back on your focus everytime they hit their spam.  Its worked wonders for us.  I haven't waisted time &quot;marking&quot; a mob in months (except boss fights for explanation to new folks).  I can hold threat over 4k DPS in my stam set (which sucks for TPS).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I agree, in my &quot;fantacy WoW&quot; tanking would require more skill and so would DPS/Healing.  In practice though, AoE slamming all trash is just part of the game.<br />
<br />
If you are are jumping targets on large mobs 1 of 2 things is going to happen.  1) you are going to fall victim to the &quot;out of range&quot; message and stand there doing nothing, or 2) you are going to be waisting GCD's using lacerate.  Plain and simple, swipe &gt; lacerate in threat rotation (on trash).  <br />
<br />
Yes, one lacerate over 8 secs is more threat than 1 swipe, BUT, 4 swipes (in 8 secs) (+/- 1 due to haste) is far greater threat than lacerate (and it hits a hell of a lot more mobs)<br />
<br />
How long is your typical trash pull?  If I had to ballpark it, I woudl say ours are 10-20 secs max.<br />
<br />
I completely agree that assisting tanks has many potential pitfalls in complex situations, but only in a WoW that does not exist today.  Single target, I have haven't come across a person in WoW that can out threat a tank in equal gear, who is well practiced (and therein is where the glory of the assist comes.  They either AoE or they are on MY single target).<br />
<br />
And everyone else bleeds targets so the lacerate + maul argument is pretty much defunked. (particularily if your melee DPS are always on your target)</div></div><hr />

No one does AoE DPS and for the most part I can still be #2-3 on DPS even as a tank (in 5-mans).<br />
<br />
And besides rogues, who else has a bleed?  I think one of the warrior DPS spec does?  But we have 2 rogues and no DPS warriors in our guild.  Do all rogue specs have a bleed?</div></div><hr />

Do you run raids (10 or 25)  If so, why in the world does your DPS not AoE?  Even 5 man, AoE should be a staple in your DPS's rotations (pull depending obviously)<br />
<br />
Um, Rogues/Warriors/Ferals would be the three with bleeds that I know of. (I know nothing about pallies/Dk though)  Yes, all rogues have a bleed, but I am not sure if all specs/builds use it as a core of their DPS.  <br />
<br />
If the tank is 2-3 on the damage done/DPS meter, regardless how good the tank is, its because the DPS is underperforming/under geared.  The very best tanks on my server (that I know of, gear capped with Sarth+3 downed) do 2k-2.5k DPS consistently over a run. More on trash, less on bosses)  By end game the average DPS should be in the 2.5k-5k consistently depending on class etc.  <br />
<br />
Single target most DPS in 25-man gear can achieve 3k pretty easiliy.</div></div><hr />

Even 5 man, AoE should be a staple in your DPS's rotations (pull depending obviously)AFAIK, I have never seen our DPS do AoE (though I'm not sure I'd recognize it even if I did see it), except maybe on the little packs of spiders that are obvious AoE targets.  I do it once in a while in cat form, but it doesn't seem to be worth the effort.  End up out of energy with maybe one mob dead.<br />
<br />
If my DPS does do AoE they must be very weak at it because I would expect all of the mobs to go down about the same time, yet the #2 and #3 mobs typically near 70-80% by the time I target them.  And that could be from my swipes/mauls.<br />
<br />
Single target most DPS in 25-man gear can achieve 3k pretty easiliy.We haven't started 25-mans and 80% have only cleared OS/Vault and 1-2 wings in Naxx (and maybe 2-6 heroics outside of hNexus, hUK or hVH).  I have yet to see a 3K DPS from anyone, except in that one DPS fight at the end of the plague wing.  So, that doesn't count.  But in all fairness, they could be doing 3K DPS and I wouldn't know as I don't run recount and/or WWS.  Every once in a while someone will broadcast their recount numbers, but those are so bogus (especially the &quot;total&quot; numbers) that I don't pay much attention to them.  Though I know I have never seen 3K.  In fact on that last boss in the plague wing, I was #1 on DPS (kitty) and I'm fairly certain I did not reach 3K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">03-13-2009, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To give you an idea, we literally only single target pulls when there is a single target to kill. aka bosses.  The rest is subject to a flurry or blizzards/hurricanes/d&amp;d/....etc.  Can't see a thing besides a blazing floor when I am tanking most of it (another reason I would like a 360 threat ability...spell effects are out of control, even when turned down).<br />
<br />
Sounds like you guys are still in the learning stages of Naxx and OS.  As such AoE would probably be used less often because it does breed it's own heartaches too. When you do get to that point, you are going to have to spam maul/swipe in order to hold all the mobs.  Lacerate and to some extent even mangle takes a back seat.<br />
<br />
I think if you guys ran WWS reports (combat log meter) you would see that at least a few of your DPS are hitting 3k on single targets.  I know meters don't tell the whole story, but once you are ready to make the hard push into the end game etc, they need to be used, if for nothing else, than the fact that they are very educational tools.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, once you have a wing on farm, I highly reccomend you have your DPS just give you a sec or two for aggro and then AoE it will shave hours off your Naxx run.  Literally. <br />
<br />
We went from farming Naxx in 5-7 hours (over 2 nights) to easily clearing in 4 hours now (over two nights).  Obviously gear improved in that time, but so did our strategies.  Many bosses have &quot;quirky&quot; fights that change DPS and effect the meters, but using those quirks to your advantage is part of being a good tank/dps/healer, so I wouldn't discount the numbers the meters show on those either.<br />
<br />
We even AoE most of the boss fights that include ads.  (the first guy in plaque is a good example.  We just stack in the middle of the room and let the fireworks begin.  He never makes a second teleport.)</div></div><hr />

Here's the WWS Report (http://wowwebstats.com/zvdtn6u2rptpa). Looks like the top 5-6 of the DPS are doing alright.  But it drops off quickly from there.  Didn't check for AoE....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">03-16-2009, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 25-man WWS looks pretty good.  If you notice your top DPSing folks #1 or #2 damage ability is likely an AOE attack.  For example the rogues #2 damage done was &quot;Fan of Knives&quot;, and its only behind &quot;swing&quot;.  <br />
<br />
To give you an idea, our top 10 folks are usually +3.5k overall, +2.8k on bosses.  But, all of them spam AoE on trash and multi-target boss fights.  So those numbers are severly inflated from thier single target DPS which is probably moer in the 2k-2.5k range.  <br />
<br />
Either way, once your tanks and healers are comfortable with the content, I strongly reccomend the AoE'fest on trash.  It makes the clear much much quicker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">03-16-2009, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw that the rogues were using their AoE.  I guess that's good.<br />
<br />
The one thing I just can't figure out, is when the feral Druid (who is tanking most of the time), does DPS he just does Mangle, SR and FB.  And his DPS is great.  I've seen other WWS reports in which he is doing nearly 3K DPS.  You can see he does it for part of the dance fight.  At some point it looks like he starts tanking...<br />
<br />
Yet all of the EJ/theorycrafters make it seem like if you don't deal with that insane kitty rotation (SR, rake, rip, mangle, shred, etc.), you DPS will suck.<br />
<br />
I wonder if this isn't one of those times in which theorycrafter lose out to Live because the game mechanics required to perform the ideal rotation are insane.  And/or not possible on most fights due to other conditions...<br />
<br />
I do know that he will be in for a surprise in 3.1 where bleeds are king once again...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, theorycrafting is always done in a &quot;Steril&quot; evinronment, where other factors (like the floor exploding) are excluded for the benefit of what is the &quot;Best&quot; rotation.  <br />
<br />
You can definatley put out some admirable DPS just using SR and FB, but a player in the same gear doing the shred/rip....etc will do considerably more.  <br />
<br />
Also, 3k DPS isn't all that good with that rotation considering its all burst damage.  I would assume he sits at 3k DPS, but well below a more consistent 2.5k DPSer in total damage done.  The reason for this is he is only hitting the boss with the &quot;Hard&quot; hits and then has significant down time.  (Read: Damage per second high, damage per fight low)<br />
<br />
In that particular fight, bleeds are especially important to total damage done because there is a good portion of the time that you cannot be actually hitting the boss.  (moving, dancing, positioning...etc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">03-31-2009, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, a quick, basic question on this nerf.  As I understand it, druid tanks are taking an armor/stam nerf.  Notoriously, on high damage fights (ie Patchwerk) I've been OT because of my larger than life HP pool and 67% Dmg Reduction by armor.<br />
<br />
If we're receiving a nerf to both stam and armor, what should I expect my DmG reduction by armor to look like?  I'm told it should be a minimum of 64% DR by armor.  With the armor nerf, is that going to be possible?<br />
<br />
Also, with the rumored stam nerf, how are we supposed to survive a Hateful Strike or two...or more...?  I'm not about qqing over changes, but I'm really confused now as to what I need to be stacking in order to still be a viable MT/OT and useful to our group's progression in end game.<br />
<br />
The nerf to healers is making that slightly less desirable, but still seems to be a little more inviting considering what bears will be facing.  <br />
<br />
I won't pretend to understand the math behind the mechanics (which is why most of my posts seem noobish I imagine).  But Desbear is a little flustered about it and previous reassurances that we'll still be a very viable and integral part of raid tanking just don't seem...I don't know.  I just want to understand how we'll still be able to MT or even OT given the expected changes.  (I know it's been addressed in this post, but you guys all talk very technically...and I'm not a really &quot;technically minded&quot; bear.)<br />
<br />
Can anyone dumb this all down for me?  Should I put on a rogue costume?</div></div><hr />

Regarding outfitter, Blizzard was going to ship their own version of a wardrobe addon in 3.1, but have since pulled it from the patch.  Sort of makes it hard to do dual-specs in the default UI without a wardrobe tool.</div></div><hr />

It seems odd give use feature X that more or less requires feature Y, yet they decide at the last minute to pull feature Y.<br />
<br />
Let's hope the 3rd party wardrobe addons handle re-specs well.  Otherwise, it could be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
I did notice that my kitty addon, BadKitty doesn't like it when I change specs.  It blows up.  I'm sure it is an easy fix, but that's just one addon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Best guess....feature &quot;Y&quot; was F'ing up the whole thing.  So the options were pull Y, or set back release. <br />
<br />
I can't imagine Outfitter or any other wardrobe mod working any different than they do today.  If you use the automation (I don't reccomend) the gear change is based on the form you take and not your spec.  So Dual spec should have no impact at all on their functionality.  <br />

I'm very surprised you did not have one Des. i could not have survived without one.<br />

Even back in the days of when i raided 40 mans i needed one to switch fast between healing and dps/bear. <br />
<br />
ie in BWL i used to heal most of it but would be tanking in Phase 1 (iirc) at Nefarion on the big dragon things....so i actually had a specific set for that - giving me a bit of bear gear versus some healing gear for the later phases when i went back to healing. Same with MC when i'd do some dps as a kitty on trash then back to my full heal set for bosses...<br />

I honestly dont mind if they withhold the outfitter mod from 3.1 just as they get a bloody move on and release 3.1 with dual specs /grrrrrrr /roar</div></div><hr />

I have (keep with me)<br />
<br />
1) Bear - Trash = High TPS / Avoidance<br />
2) Bear - Boss = Mix of Stam / Avoidance<br />
3) Bear - Stam = Uber Stam (Sarth etc)<br />
4) Kitty - Raid = Hit Capped (also serves as my Heroic Bear Gear, otherwise go rage starved)<br />
5) Boomkin - Hit Cap<br />
6) Resto - Spirit Stacked<br />
7) Herbing - Haste Stacked, pick a flower in ~4 secs  :)<br />
<br />
8) I have several PvP sets too, but they stay in the bank.<br />
<br />
...I have all +20 slot bags and only room in my backpack for non-gear.<br />
<br />
Many of these sets share items with each other, but there is no way I could manage them without Outfitter.  May seem excessive, but to quote a disney movie &quot;Luck favors the prepared&quot;!  Have the right gear for the right encounter = Win.<br />
<br />
Also, even as feral I like to keep my +SP set close for &quot;Near Wipes&quot;.  10-15 bodies on the floor and folks need Rez's, its a lot speedier if the bear slaps on +SP gear and Innervates self then starts helping rez.  No Incombat advantage, just a time saver and curtiousy to those who keep me alive!  :flipbg:</div></div><hr />

Khel, I'm so jealous!  <br />

And, tbh, I've never really &quot;needed&quot; alternative sets of gear.  The guild I used to be in was set.  We had a bunch of healers, a bunch of DPS and very few tanks.  So, anytime we did anything I always was tank.  If I had to DPS, like I said, I'd swap out the few kitty pieces I had and go from there.

Unless I find a good compromise on a build, I'm not sure I'll be running 5-mans much.  Which is sort of sad, because I love them.<br />

Edit:  If any of you know of a site that lists all of the dailies, let me know.  Maybe I'll run a few at some point.  Though I have 100+ &quot;normal&quot; quests left to do in last two zones.  So, it is not like I'm hurting for quest material to run.</div></div><hr />

We are trying Ulduar tonight, so I can let you know how epic fail that goes!  Good chance for Noob stories out of this run.  Its been a long time since we went into a boss fight not knowing really, any strategy (assuming we get by the trash).</div></div><hr />

Of course, our instance server went down very soon after the first leg, so I can't say whether or not everything was being reported correctly there.  It seems some of my out of date addons wreaked a whole lot of havoc on the old game last night, including chat and reporting interface so, that may have been it.  I'll have to keep a closer eye out tonight.<br />

I can't wait to hear how Ulduar goes tonight, Solar!  I'll be watching for updates tomorrow!</div></div><hr />
