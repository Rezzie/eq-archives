<br />
I need to do the Tooga escort quest for his ring... however, when I located him, he wouldn't talk to me.  He has no quest icon at all.<br />
<br />
I'm just now leveling this toon up, and have never done this quest on it.  In other words, I didn't accidentally do it and forget.  It's definitely never been done.<br />
<br />
Are there any prerequisites for Tooga that Thottbot doesn't mention, or something?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I've checked everywhere including his wife.  He's supposed to be the questgiver, himself... asks you to take him to Steamwheedle.<br />
<br />
I think he's likely bugged, I just wanted to ask around before I open a ticket.  I haven't leveled a toon in a very long time... and leveling this one in the last few weeks, I have come across a TON of bugged quest NPCs; many are for quests I've done before on prior toons, so I know they worked at one time.<br />
<br />
I don't know if hung NPCs is unique to Alleria server, but it's really rampant there.  I've had to abandon some big quest chains because of it.<br />
<br />
Not that opening a ticket will do a spot of good.  Not to bash the GMs, but the advice will consist of, at most, &quot;wait for another reset&quot;.  Since Alleria has hard crashed 3 times (that I know of) and been restarted twice (that I know of) since I started trying to get this quest from the turtle last week, I'm guessing a server restart is not the answer. &lt;g&gt;<br />
