<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">04-09-2006, 12:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have been puzzling over this so I thought where better to ask:<br />
<br />
   Currently on my druid (70, almost full aa, self buffed not quite 10k hp, bit over 9k mana) that I can solo many mobs...but I would like to push a bit higher and kill a bit tougher mobs in some areas by using my second account and second comp a bit.<br />
<br />
Have a 67 warrior with ok gear on the second account but I find that with almost no aa he really isnt tanking that much better than the druid with better gear and full aa.  So....<br />
<br />
Would this be feasible:  PL a shammy on the second account to provide slows (plus a few buffs and some spare healing) and just tank with the druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im mainly looking for a way to kill in areas that are full of summoners that I just cant quite kill solo now, or some of the named that I cant quite solo now.  I *think* that a shammy slow would make a lot more content doable but Im not sure if this is the way to go.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mainly looking for general opinions...leveling the warrior to 70 and getting a few aa wouldnt be hard at all but wouldnt add slow or much dps, so not sure if that path wouldnt just be a dead end.<br />
<br />
PLing a BST would add slow (weaker version) and some dps, but would probably still be relying on druid to tank.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sliggoth</div><div class="date">04-09-2006, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know the warrior would tank better than the druid with a little work...but heting a shammy up to the mid 60s wouldnt be a problem either.  For the warrior combo to work Im going to need to debuff heavily with ros etc, then have the druid do most of the dps, plus heal.....so keeping agro with the warrior is going to take a bit of work.  mobs wont be slowed remember , so keeping the warrior alive is going to take some work.<br />
<br />
As it stands now the druid easily steals and keeps agro, so Im thinking of using a shammy to just make my life easier.  Its not that im looking for the best duo partner, Im looking for what other class would boost my killing power right now.<br />

just a FYI, in case that changes your mind :-))</div></div><hr />

It is nice when it goes off (and isnt resisted) but its not anything to count on.  No good way to root the mob and slow it with a ToD, heh.<br />

Use reptile on warrior for aggro. These little heals help a lot.<br />
 <br />
Besides, if you ever want to group with anyone, having tank and healer is MUCH BETTER starting point than slower and healer.<br />
 <br />
Third thing is that managing two casters is way harder than caster+melee. Well, unless your caster is one trick pony like wiz or mage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alaene</div><div class="date">04-11-2006, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On occasion I duel box a shammy and a druid.  It's difficult to get the most out of two casters, but doable - don't let that part put you off, it's just practice.<br />
<br />
I am torn, though - although my druid and shammy aren't full-aa/uber geared, against the kind of mobs that I’d like to be soloing neither cut it from a tanking perspective.  Mobs these days hit so hard, and fast, that a tank would be amazingly useful – what you need is both :)<br />
<br />
I would decide based on what content you want to solo and whether you can uber-gear the tank.  If you’re soloing older content, go with the Shammy – the mob DPS isn’t as brutal.  If you can get your warrior to the point where he has defensive aa as well as high ac, shielding mods, etc etc, and want to solo current content, go that way.,  <br />
<br />
Let us know which you go, and how you get on :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amped</div><div class="date">04-12-2006, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would actually go one further.  I 2 box an SK and a druid. SK is atm 10.7 K  hps/ 2.3 K AC. Sk is not the best DPs, but IMO adds more than Warrior, holds aggro WAY better and with things like Feign death allows you to pull anythign single. Much better than WAR, IMO. Admittedly i am biased, but hey. But with lifetaps, innate lifetap procs, lifetap proc buffs, Sks can self heal pretty well. Throw in SotR and a few heals, and the mob is dead with not a lot mana drain. Makes it a very easy combo to port in somewhere, pull what u want, kill it, and port out to the next spot. I offered this since it sems like you don't really want to level the warrior u almost have to 70 anyway, and woudl rather level somethign else. You could get the Sk a willsaper or something similar that would proc more ofthen than the ToD. I don't use a slow wep myself, but rarely have problems.</div></div><hr />

She buffs to 12k hp and doesn't do too shabby of a job. Reptile on her and she is golden for majority of places I go. Prior to using her to tank mobs I used her as range DPS with bow on autofire. It's not great DPS, but it's like adding a nice dot on that doesn't need refreshed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">04-17-2006, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I box SK also, next to my druid main. He's young still, only 9k/2k unbuffed and 200 AA, but growing up slowly. Can do some crazy pulls when you put together FD, snare (on both characters), evac, harmony and harmshield :)<br />
 <br />
SK lifetap nukes / dots / innate proc buffs help heal him.. add reptile and that's pretty damn good. He doesn't even have crit heals yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madex</div><div class="date">04-19-2006, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how about a 62 monk and a 67 druid? Where would be some good spots to duo? Is there any typ eof list out there of stuff I could solo with these 2 toons? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">madex</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about a monk and druid combo? I have a 62 monk naked on a seperate account then my main 67 druid any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skabe</div><div class="date">04-20-2006, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I regularily box Druid / Paladin combo and can usually Keep most mobs slowed with willsapper.... Pally is lvl 70 12.5K hps 2.5K AC with 550 AAs Druid is lvl 70 with 300 AAs.  So far I have managed all of WoS and MPG trash with just using buffs available with these 2 toons and potions. An MPG named is next on my list to challenge ..... only major issue so far is mobs that ramp and keeping Druid out of ramp range but still close enough to heal if needed. Usually tho druid is there strictly for dps and snare.<br />
So I would definitely raise up your warrior get him a ToB and use the new Audio triggers so you know when mob is slowed or its worn off :) that is if you can figure out how to make it work and if you do pls let me know hehe</div></div><hr />
