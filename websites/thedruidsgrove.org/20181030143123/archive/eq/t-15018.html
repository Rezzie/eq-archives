Does Velkator have to be up for Velketor's Experiments and/or Failed Experiments to be up also?  I've been hunting in there for a couple of days now killing the mobs and they still haven't popped.  At least I'm not seeing them on my track.  I thought about bringing my ranger on to track but not sure if it would make any difference.  Thanks in advance for any answers I get.<br />

Just keep at it is all I can say. I found mine just after the tunnel from the pups cave. Just before the AE dispell area. Druid should be able to track any once that far.</div></div><hr />

I helped a guildie hunt for several days just clearing the entire castle as often as we could.  I think she ended up spending a total of about 20 hours there.  I on the other hand spent about 45 min and got mine.  All I can say is GOOD LUCK!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vekx</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also I have seen 2 up at once before. I saw 2 on track the first time I went after mine. but by the time I got to the rooms by Velkator some group had already wiped them out and was after Velk himself.</div></div><hr />

I just got that part done about 2 weeks ago. It just took some time before one spawned - we cleared the castle for almost a full day before we finally got it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sassenach</div><div class="date">12-18-2006, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay another question...the crippled wurm in burning woods...does it spawn after you get Velks done or when you enter the zone?  I had to go into the zone to help someone and on the off chance I checked my track for it and it wasn't up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eiram</div><div class="date">12-22-2006, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was lucky to have one up when i was on that stage, it took me perhaps 40 mins to clear my way to it ans then a nice 5min fight with the construkt and 3 or 4 adds beating me all down and i was a happy druid :)<br />
btw my mob was in the room at the end of the way that passes the door to Velk himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other Hand i spend about 20 hours for a fellow druid :(<br />

good luck to you</div></div><hr />

Another question now...conflicting posts, the one I have printed off about the epic saies to do the combine with Anguish orb...doesn't say anything about being in Anguish and in a instance.  The one I looked up again just recently said that I need to do this.  Which one is the correct one?  Thanks in advance for putting up with me on this.<br />
 <br />
Merry Christmas<br />

Mobs in there are 20 minute spawn - there are 6? of them.  Camped my druid there (brought my warrior with me) and cleared the room, then camped for 20 minutes. It took about 1.5 hours of clearing, camping, logging back in to get one to pop.</div></div><hr />
