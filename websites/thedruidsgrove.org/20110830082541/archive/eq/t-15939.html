<br />
The EQ Board has quite a few sub-forums that see little or no use by the EQ community.  Others, while informative may not have been updated in ages.  So, we're going to ask you, the active Everquest community, to tell us which forums you use the most/least.  Depending on the content of the various forums, we may choose to delete (hide) the forums, or merge the posts into an already existing forum.  Some of the forums - like General or Archive, will not be listed due to their nature.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Please read all these instructions before voting!&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
1 - The poll is multiple choice, so select any forum you use on a regular basis<br />
2 - If the forum lists a &quot;would be merged with&quot; in the description, and you &lt;b&gt;agree&lt;/b&gt; with the merging, &lt;b&gt;*do not*&lt;/b&gt; select the forum.<br />
3 - If the forum lists a &quot;would be merged with&quot; in the description and you &lt;b&gt;do not agree&lt;/b&gt; with the merging, &lt;b&gt;select the forum&lt;/b&gt;.<br />
4 - If the forum does not list a merging, the forum would probably be removed<br />
5 - This poll will be open for 12 days (June 4th - 16th)<br />
6 - This is a public poll so we can all see what you're selecting (muahahaha? - actually I just sort of figured no one would care).<br />
<br />
Note:  In this case &quot;merged&quot; means that all existing threads from &quot;Forum_A&quot; would be moved into &quot;Forum_B&quot;.  All threads will retain their original creation date and latest modification date, so if we moved 100 threads from Unkempt into General, that does not mean General would suddenly have 100 &quot;brand new&quot; threads listed.<br />
<br />
Questions?  Please ask &lt;b&gt;before voting&lt;/b&gt;!</div></div><hr />

I think. So, if I still want to have a forum and *NOT* have it merged I should vote for it yeah?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">06-11-2007, 08:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, if you vote for the forum, that means that you want to keep it separate.  I.E.: &quot;I like the contents of this forum separate from 'Forum_X'.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you don't vote for the forum, it's like saying &quot;I don't use it that much, I wouldn't notice if the contents got merged into 'Forum_X'.&quot;</div></div><hr />
