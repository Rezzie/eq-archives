<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maitri</div><div class="date">05-24-2007, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone :)<br />
<br />
I started playing in 2000 and brought a druid up to 52, then started a cleric, took her to 70 (over the course of several years of course), and leveled several alts as well, on Cazic-thule then Bristlebane, where my chars live now.<br />
 <br />
I quit in Jan 2005 when my comp couldn't handle OOW.  However, my circumstances have improved (new husband, great job, baby on the way) and I can afford the comp upgrades to game again.  I've been playing Vanguard but it's a very frustrating enterprise; it's a lot of soloing, exp is very slow, and there's no raid content so no motivation.<br />
 <br />
Soooo .. I should have EQ Anniversary sitting on my doorstep this evening :D  I would like to start playing again.  I don't want to play my cleric, though.  Frustrations with the class were part of my reason for quitting in 05.  I *would* like to pick up my elfie druid again, though.<br />
 <br />
Here's my question.  I have the spell list printed out and have been reading up on stuff but I'm not seeing lots of information on the game at 50-75.  Is it dead, will I be soloing to 75?  Or will I still find folks to group with in the old PoP zones like Plane of Innovation?<br />
 <br />
Another question is that I think I probably have about 60k plat on my cleric.  I need to re-equip the druid.  What can I get for that, and what *should* I get?  Is it even possible to re-equip for that amount?<br />
 <br />
Sorry if this is in the wrong place; mods, please feel free to move my post to wherever it should be.<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

Starting back in your 50's, i'd say you WILL have some soloing ahead of you - Though not all the way to 75... It really depends on the server population, what time zone you're in, if you have any old friends in game still etc.<br />
<br />
Again, depending on the server and it's economy, there would be some upgrade you could get cheaply, can often find some nice bargains in the bazaar - Again, relative to what gear you currently have. Gear will impact on how fast you'll be able to gain exp (what level of mobs you can kill..), but with the new Out of Combat regen system, soloing isn't as tedious as it used to be.</div></div><hr />

Its very possible for a druid to solo from 1-75.  If you have the mana, its much quicker then groups sometimes.</div></div><hr />

If you have the cleric still, you can get it to 75 no prob.</div></div><hr />

Everquest right now is full of folks who are going to give you lots of advice on what you should do to get to 75, because that's where the action is at, in the so-called Endgame. I have to say that, except for raiding (which also has it's bad side) I didn't get much more enjoyment grinding AA's at 70 and 75, than I did soloing levels at 35, or grouping for xp at 60.<br />
 <br />
I suggest you just play your druid, and enjoy playing EQ. You can solo effectively up to level 60 Quad kiting or Root Rotting,. With the new expansions, like TSS, you can actually solo all the way up to 75, rooting and dotting, or kiting singles. It just takes time, since the quad kite kind of dies at that point. It's up to you to figure out what your time is worth to you.<br />
 <br />
If the Endgame is where you want to be, then group up and grind xp. But as a cleric or a druid, I think you understand that healers are seen by others as a necessary evil. They need one to keep the tank up so that others can do the real work of killing the mob. It's not the job of a star, because no one is going to be wow'd by your ability to heal without going OOM.<br />
 <br />
There are quiet a few threads talking about soloing, I usually link them, but the search feature works well now. Search for Timorous Deep for one that I've posted on before. <br />
 <br />
As far as gear, I don't know how much 60K gets in the bazaar right now, but DON radiant crystals used to be cheap, and there are probably a few upgrades in the DON camps that you can grab up.<br />
 <br />
Good luck.:)</div></div><hr />

The only thing to take care of is required levels on items.  Most of what I name below will work for the cleric but not the druid.<br />
<br />
What you need to look for is high quality/high-supply items - they end up being priced well below their real/objective value.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to do this is use the bazaar search window - look for items between say 0-5000p, and sort by mana.  You'll find every now and then there are some exceptional value items.<br />
<br />
Try Direwrought Leather Sleeves.  They may be in lower supply with people having moved out of Direwind, but these were selling for 100p on CT for a while.  An Iceborn Diamond Necklace from Icefall still goes cheaply on CT, also.<br />
<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />

I have found DoN expasion to be a wonderful place to get very good gear. You can purchase the Radiant crystals in the baz or set up a trader and get them that way. Its rare to find people doing the missions that will yeld the crystals these days. You can sell back lower level gear as you grow out of it, so you lose a little of the purchase value on trade in but its not a waste.<br />
<br />
DoDh missions have really good gear as well. But require you to be rather high in level. Soloing 69.1 missions or Nest missions are both amazingly awesome solo exp, again that is higher level.<br />
<br />
But i agree.....play and enjoy yourself. welcome back to EQ.</div></div><hr />
