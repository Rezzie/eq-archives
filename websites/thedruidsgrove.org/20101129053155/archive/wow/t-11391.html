What's the longest battle so far?  Note this can have drastically different results depending on the specs of each druid.</div></div><hr />

Two restos vs me and a teammate is my biggest fear tbh (as both restos likely will use that trick). :(</div></div><hr />

He's 46/5, and I'm 30/21. I was going to heal and help damage, and he was going to kill. However, I signed us up as a group--we were in a party and such--and we both went to different arenas... So... Yeah.<br />

Also, unless your gear pwns, don't go, in my opinion. I learned that after 3 matches of being 1-3 shotted by ANY class there. Maybe it's just me, but I also ended up in a 3v5 when I signed up for 5v5. I'm going to wait until 70 before I give it another go. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />
