<br />
I'm trying to raise the mining skill of an alt so that he can mine thorium/arcane crystals (The price of crystals are crazy!).  He currently has 240 skill and I've been running him around the mountains (outer areas) of Hinterlands mining up whatever I can find.  Most of what I see is Mithril with a node or two of iron.  Mithril is green for me and iron is already grey.  I've looked up on thott and truesilver is the only ore next before thorium, but it sure seems like a long way to get there (Thorium requires 275).<br />
<br />
I was wondering if Hinterlands is a good place to mine at this level? are there better places?  Also, are there better places for truesilver?<br />
<br />
Any info or suggestions would be great!<br />
Thanks a bunch</div></div><hr />

EPL and Winterspring.<br />

For Mithiril theres a nice spot in Badlands.<br />

Here's a picture.<br />

The dots are hotspots where you are almost guaranteed to find a vein (unless someone else is following this route) and the silverish parts are iron.<br />

Either way I wouldn't recoment either EPL or Winterspring.  Truesilver is a rare spawn  for Mithril OR Rich Thorium Veins (I'm not sure if lesser Thor veins can spawn TS).  In EPL/WS it's going to be Thorium if it's not True Silver and you won't be able to mine that at all.<br />
<br />
Depending on your level, I'd recomend Un'goro, Fellwood, Badlands.  They'll have plenty of Mithril, even tho it's green it'll still skill you up... and the occasional True Silver.<br />
<br />
You could always get the mining enchant on your gloves, and if your alt can wear mail and is an engineer, you can make the miner's helm... the two bonuses will make Thorium aviable that much sooner.</div></div><hr />

But from reading up, I thought truesilver was one of those rare spawn ores that sometimes replaces mithril? or am I thinking of something else. <br />
<br />
and the alt is a lvl 60 pally that my brother plays (I'm one of those begging blizz to speed up character account transfers) - he's just too lazy to level his mining and told me if I wanted arcane crystals, I'd have to do the work for him.  Anyway, because of this, I'd like prefer efficient mining (more mining, less combat).  I'll probably stick to badlands and hinterlands ('cause they're pretty close to SW - his hearth) and keep doing rounds. <br />
<br />
One more question.. is there a difference in mining level for rich thorium and small thorium veins?  The dreadlords site mentioned something like they're at different levels?  Can someone confirm this please?<br />
<br />
thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Here's a decent guide<br />
