<br />
She did not, and I just got another email chain letter.  After giveaway.  After chain letter.  After urban legend.  After jokes.spam.com ****.<br />
<br />
Guess what? I RE All'ed(ie I spammed, ha).<br />
<br />
Explaining all the really bad stuff with this junk and how morons do this kind of stuff, with links.<br />
<br />
At least some of the other idiots on her list will know what a duffass she is.<br />
Wonder how much longer she will continue to be a friend?</div></div><hr />

I feel your pain :).  I have a couple of friends who do the same thing.  One will even say, when I see her, that I never write back. I just don't feel like she is writing to me when it's sent out to like 20 people on a list, and of course I never answer those chain things.</div></div><hr />

It's common sense to us, but by definition it's not actually &quot;common&quot; sense at all because not that many have learned it.  So flaming them en-masse wouldn't be very kind ;)<br />
<br />
I see your frustration though, especially as the only IT support person for an organisation with 60 employees and about 150 volunteers who keep flippin' about with every &quot;cool screensaver&quot; they receive and forwarding smileycentral rubbish to each other!</div></div><hr />

Except is usually christian or Pro Bush stuff. I've asked to stop sending the pro Bush stuff because it pisses me off. She knows how I feel about him and its like she thinks she'll change my mind with the crap. Grrrrr....drives me nuts!</div></div><hr />

Make a hotmail account and let them spam that one until it fills up and gives them the annoying &quot;I'm filled up&quot; return email.<br />
Or tell them you had to program your email to autodelete any emails from them because you started missing important work emails and you don't want to accidentally miss a &quot;real&quot; email from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hypothetical Situation:<br />
<br />
Your friend punches you out to get their keys back when you were trying to keep them from driving drunk, then proceedes to run down 30 school children making their way home..<br />
<br />
Are they still your friend? (inevitably some of you will say yes, you are in need of therapy or at least a good self help book like Co-Dependent No More)<br />
<br />
My example was ridiculosly extreme, I agree.  However, if someone is not willing to stop doing something really simple, because they know it really annoys you, I think it is a stretch to call them a friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flintwick</div><div class="date">06-22-2004, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply put people who send me junk like that on my &quot;blocked&quot; list. Then I wait for them to ask me why I didn't respond to one of their &quot;real&quot; emails. I just say flat-out, &quot;I blocked your email address because you kept sending me crap. I've been on the internet since 1996 or so... I've seen all your 'cute' jokes, sappy 'footprints in the sand' stories, funny pictures, etc., an uncountable number of times. If you'd like me to unblock you, I will... but the first time you send me more idiotic crap like that, I'll put you back on it - and I will NOT remove you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Has worked everytime so far. Although, if they sent me chain letters, I never unblock them... I mean, how freakin' stupid are these people?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i reply to them from one of their chain emails with something to the effect of &quot;rofl thanks for sending this.  was having a tough day and i just laughed and laughed when i got your email.  it just kills me that people actually believe this stuff...&quot;<br />
<br />
that usually drastically reduces the number of forwarded email i get from that person, once i get this email back:<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, hehe.  i thought it was funny too....um...glad you liked it.&quot;</div></div><hr />
