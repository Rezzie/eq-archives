<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aedian22879</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nothing summons but named mobs. Well, and the guardian things over by the second castle. Just have to watch out for the occasional &quot;immune to run speed&quot; yard trash that happens randomly.  Baby horses (green to 65) aren't animals, but baby spiders are. So you can dire charm them if you have the AA. I don't have CoT so wouldn't even know about trying bigger spiders. Stuff hits hard and doesn't like to stay rooted too well.  Fair amount of hps on mobs.  Just mostly trial and error finding what you wanna kill there. There are a few really nice spots, but are typically taken, as they don't support many people without running over each other.<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats on making it to fire. Good luck in your hunting.</div></div><hr />
