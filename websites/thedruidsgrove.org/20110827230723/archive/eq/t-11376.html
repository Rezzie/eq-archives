I will ALWAYS go for HP and MANA over AC.<br />

I'm an end game raider. The mobs I get agro from when I do are bigtime beaters. A little extra mitigation makes the difference between my being dead in 2.78 seconds vs 2.34.<br />

I'd rather have the HP to survive AEs or the Mana to Heal.</div></div><hr />

I still use 2 AC augs and prefer them myself.  It depends on what augs are available to you, i would take a 25ac aug over a 35hp aug, and do.  If you strictly raid not going to see any difference, but when i solo i tank quite a bit, and the extra mitigation helps out bigtime.  200hp is not going to make a significant difference at all, but 200AC will.  I generally use a formula around 1ac to 2hp or so.  Would rep out a 25AC aug with a 70hp aug, but not for a 45.<br />

I'm a big fan of AC. When I'm not raiding I sometimes go hunting things 2-box style with my enchanter. This usually involves tanking with my druid. I've noticed mobs have become significantly easier as my AC has gone up; mobs that used to be risky business are now fairly easy and only require a few heals throughout the fight.<br />
<br />
I have 3 x 25ac augs from RSS and one 20ac aug from Yxtta. I'm finding it harder and harder to justify these as hp/mana on alternative augs go up (would be 90/90 atm), but so far I'm holding on to them. My max buffed AC atm, including tributes, is 2498.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">06-16-2005, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know a few months back I saw parsings that concluded that the AC softcap for PoV and PoW mobs was ~1350.  Now, of course vs an anguish trash mob the softcap would be much higher, but its my assumption that its about 1700 - this would be hard to parse.  On the other hand, things like raw hp, avoidance (cap = 100), and shielding (cap = 35%) would be more valuable tools against lowering mob's melee dps on you than AC.  <br />
 <br />
But your friend is still right, for an SK / tank AC = king, i keep 8 AC augs on my warrior, but on my druid i make 0 effort to accomidate for ac.  <br />
 <br />
Question for original poster - what zones / mobs are you refering to for ac benefit? it has a lot to do with the expansion / zone / mob lvl etc..</div></div><hr />
