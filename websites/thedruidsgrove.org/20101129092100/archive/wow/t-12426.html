I am planning on making my druid feral. I know there is a 15 point bonus in herb but not sure if I would make more gold at herb or mining. Any suggestions? <br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />

The key for either is to make sure you gather (or mine) every time you see one that could give you a skill-up even if it requires you to kill 1-2 mobs.  Doing so, you should have no problem leveling herbalism (I was at 375 by lvl62 with no effort).<br />
<br />
There are a few skill ranges (pre-300) in mining that do require that you spend some time looking for ore.  So, expect a couple times in which you need to spend 1-3 hours mining.  I typically try to keep my mining skill up as I level until I reach mining skill 225(?).  Then wait until I'm level 60+ and go back and finish mining up to 300 in one longer mining spree.  Once you reach 300 in mining, the last 75 are quite easy.<br />
<br />
Skinning is free zero-effort money while leveling.  You'll have no trouble buying your lvl 40 mount if you take-up skinning.  Not sure it is all that great of an end-game skill, but once you reach 70, switch to something else isn't all that bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the end game, ie once you are level 70, herbalism is arguably one of the most important skills to have.<br />
It allows you to get the materials required to make potions, elixirs and flasks, and these things are crucial for raiding.<br />
<br />
Whilst mining is generally better money while levelling, there are some really valuable herbs you can pick even at low levels.  Stranglekelp, for example, sells at a disproprortionally high price considering how early you can start picking it.  Stranglekelp also grows underwater, which puts druids at a unique advantage since we can use Aquatic Form to pick lots of it efficiently, in very little time, without ever having to come to the surface for air.<br />
<br />
Herbalism at high levels is also a good source of money, and it is easy and fun to fly around in bird form picking flowers.  It also helps you a lot when you're raiding because you will always have a plentiful supply of needed consumables.  Mining, by contrast, becomes rather less useful once you've been level 70 for a while.<br />
<br />
One other thing to consider.  You can pick herbs whilst in a form, such as bird form, or travel form - this makes it very easy to farm herbs.  You cannot mine ore in forms.<br />

<br />
on your first lvl 70 char u want to have herbalism.<br />
its not needed but helps alot when u are farming gold for your epic-flight-skill.<br />
u would have to spent a **** load of money for the herbs u need for your raiding potions/elixiers/flasks.<br />
<br />
mining can provide u with gems for socketing your gear but i need far more raid-buffs than gems for socketing.<br />
<br />
i wish u could show herbs and mining on the minimap^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
bought my epic flight skill only 2/3 weeks ago and then bought the CE War Hippogryph so was down a little on gold after that :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
with some major herbing and the 10 daily's i've started making myself do i'm now back to the point where i will soon be able to afford another epic flight skill :D <br />
<br />
once i get a few more nethers to make a couple of items i think i'm going to respec to alchy and see how much can be made from selling pots to raiders as well :flipbg:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">02-27-2008, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suggest you try pciking both herbalism and mining...<br />
The tracking wont be a problem since you can use addons like gatherer or cartographer, which show all herb and mining nodes on the map.<br />
This way you should end up having a lot of money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">02-27-2008, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i find gatherer invaluable for targeting specific routes for picking herbs.<br />
<br />
i tried mining on my mage alt for a while but found levelling it soo damn slow i gave up on it and took herby (he's a skinner to).<br />
<br />
not sure if could be bothered to try to level mining on my main and have him do mining and herby but i guess if i did and got him maxed out i would able to make some serious money with the 2 profs and daily's.</div></div><hr />

There is an addon i have seen called Gatherer that will do this for you. it doesnt have them all i have found though but a good amount of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i know. gatherer shows the positions where there could be a plant or mine. <br />
but u can only have 1 tracking running and see the yellow dot on the minimap for either herbing OR mining.</div></div><hr />

but u can only have 1 tracking running and see the yellow dot on the minimap for either herbing OR mining.I have both mining and herbalism.  Using the gatherer (and the pre-seeded database) you can see when you get close to spots that _may_ have herbs or veins.  I just toggle between the two as I fly around looking for them.<br />
<br />
Now if you expect to just accidentally run into nodes, having both professions is a bit difficult.  But if you are actively searching it is a non-issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can have them both on and showing on gatherer it just makes the map a bit cluttered. But you can also play around with the size of the icon that is shown on the map and it isnt that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">03-11-2008, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had finished questing Outlands before I installed Gatherer - (better late than never, I guess).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I flew around Outlands for about 2 weeks straight just picking herbs and filling my screen with beautiful little herb symbols, making tons of money and potions in the process.  I was thrilled with Gatherer.<br />
<br />
Then, about a month back, my game *glitched* and my I somehow lost all...my...add-ons.  Everything outside of WoW itself had to be reloaded.<br />
<br />
Not gonna lie....tears were shed.  <br />
<br />
Trust me when I tell you: <br />

*violin softly plays in background*<br />

You really don't know what you've got until it's gone. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
i thought they specifically said it does not support any form of data import !<br />
<br />
will check it out later....thanks tlb.</div></div><hr />

They use to say that.  I'm not sure when it changed.  One day I just happened to see it on the Gatherer site when I was out updating all of my addons.</div></div><hr />
