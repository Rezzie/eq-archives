Savage Defense-whenever we crit, we get a damage shield for 25% of our AP. not the most godly thing ever convieved but could be kinda cool. I'm impressed how they've been able to turn yet another &quot;rogue&quot; stat into a tanking stat. All the classes are getting buffed in preparation for ulduar. At the same time they're nerfing our armor, the idea being that SD will continue to scale up with us through ulduar and later raids, whereas currently our armor is or is almost capped.<br />
<br />
on a side note once this come out we'll have another incentive to gem agility over stamina.</div></div><hr />

Another thing - Strength adds AP to bear - which makes our shield bigger.  Strength is prob the stat to share on hybrid pieces.  More shield and more dps in cat.</div></div><hr />

I have a warrior in my guild with really nice gear that just cannot believe how much less Patch hits me for than him and makes the best comments. He is another true believer in stam-stacking though, and I just can't bring him to the light.:curse:</div></div><hr />
