Now there are plenty of quests out there, for both sides, however not all have gear we can actually use.  I wonder if we can get a list started, or indeed if anyone is even interested in doing this.  When I get home (at work now) ill post some of the ones I have done, with gear rewards we can use.   Be best to include what  Alliane/Horde zone and person starts the quest and what reward</div></div><hr />

Aside from that none come to mind.  I was mentioining to my friend there doesn't seem to be a lot of leather rewards for quest, maybe it's just my perceptioin.</div></div><hr />

Just let me know.</div></div><hr />
