 with HOTW, moonkin, and lunar guidance,  my hope was that HoTW combined with lunar guidance would signifigantly up my balance dps while allowing me to still have some nice tallents in the ferral tree and a mele dps synergy between predatory strikes and natural weapons.  My question is what's the average int for a blue geared 60 moonkin, and secondly do you think my build is any good at all? (the biggest problem i can find w/ it is the lack of furror)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

I'm not sure about the avg. int but if you want to use this build as a 'hybrid' like a nuke-and-melee style, I would assume you'd want a bit more hybrid gear (ones with melee stats and not just ones with caster stats)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gwmort</div><div class="date">09-28-2006, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been considering something very similar to this, although I would swap nature's reach for control of nature given how melee focused it is, and I took Balance of Power over natural shifter.<br />
<br />
The issue I am having with it deals with Dreamstate, and whther the regen is better mana supply than the higher pool from HotW.<br />
<br />
For instance, lets assume you are an average geared end-game moonkin for this melee style (full Feralheart, moderate spell damage accessories and weapons).  You're probably looking at about 300 int.  Now lets assume we go 31 pts in balance and 27 pts in feral, which gets us 2 ranks of HotW, and 3 pts left to spend.  We have 8% more int for a total of 324.<br />
<br />
If we put those last 3 pts in Dreamstate, we get 32.4 mana/5, if we put them in HotW we get 12% more int or 36 pts = 540 mana (total 360 int).<br />
<br />
If we put 1 pt in dreamstate and 2 in HotW we get 24 more int (348) and 14 mana/5, 2 pt dreamstate and 1 pt HotW gives 12 more int (336) and 23.5 mana/5. Or more simply:<br />
<br />
Points in Dreamstate:<br />
0 = 36 more int (540 mana); no regen<br />
1 = 24 more int (360 mana); 14 mana/5<br />
2 = 12 more int (180 mana); 23.5 mana/5<br />
3 = 0  more int; 32.4 mana/5<br />
<br />
If a fight lasts more than 1 min 5 seconds, you get more mana from 1 point in Dreamstate than you get from HotW.  If a fight lasts longer than 1 min 15 seconds 2 points in Dreamstate is better, and if the fight s longer than 1 min 25 seconds 3 points in dreamstate is better.<br />
<br />
Also need to consider that with lunar guidance, 25% of any int will be added +dmg and heal, but that is still only +9dmg/heal with all 3 points in HotW.<br />
<br />
I think I just made up my mind to go with 34/27.</div></div><hr />
