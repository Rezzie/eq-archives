<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-17-2009, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, I was recently asked to heal H:HoL.<br />
<br />
I was told that DPS was not going to run from the Lightning Nova, and to &quot;heal through&quot; it.<br />
<br />
O.O  I almost died.<br />
<br />
Luckily, the squishy that was with us INSISTED that everyone run, so that's what we did.<br />
<br />
It's hard enough trying to keep up a tank and the occasional DPS or two that can't get away fast enough - for me at least.  I've tanked it and had a resto druid that insisted we not run, and that he'd heal through it- and he did so beautifully.<br />
<br />
How, though, do you do it?  WG isn't big enough to repair that much damage quickly.  It was suggested to time LB so that it hit on everyone just after the nova- but I fail at timing things and with the mana cost, I'd be oom very quickly...if DPS was slow, I can foresee it being a problem.<br />
<br />
Is this a matter of having a lot of haste?  Would you Nourish-spam the group?  I've never healed through the nova, and was curious.  This sort of ties into the question for H:AN too...which I think unfortunately I posted on the feral side...I'm such a noob =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said save your NS+HT for the tank, pre-HoT the tank and yourself and prioritize the rest. Hit WG when he emotes just prior to Nova, get RJ up on as many as you can, Nourish spam between WG's after the nova to top people up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">07-18-2009, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">depends on your tank, too. If you're running with a DK tank, the anti-magic bubble will definitely get you through the first nova, and hopefully your dps is strong enough to wreck him before the second. Oiysters is probably right though... you probably have to be overgeared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-18-2009, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Understood.  It was more of a curiosity than anything else.  I don't dare try it just yet, but was curious &quot;how&quot; you would do it if you were doing it.  I appreciate the replies =) <br />
<br />
Maybe after I'm a little more experienced/better geared I'll give that a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">07-18-2009, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'd agree with the 'needing to overgear it' thing.  I failed miserably at it early on in my raiding at lvl 80, but managed it later with much better gear.<br />
<br />
Oiysters pretty much nailed it: pre-HoTing is very important, WG every time it's available, and nourish/NS-HT the heck out of the tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-19-2009, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">we usually seem to heal through it.<br />
<br />
we run with a great healer. and as long as we have decent dps and not any bad uns its usually doable.<br />
<br />
now idea what he casts on us though ! i've yet to heal HoL myself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-20-2009, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We ran it last night...some of the DPS/tank ran...the other dps and myself stood there and ate the nova...I think 2 of the dps died...but that was mainly because they would run out of range.<br />
<br />
So, a tip:  If you're going to stand there and eat it- then everyone should stand there and eat it.  If you're going to run...EVERYONE needs to run...otherwise it's just too confusing and leads to chaos, missed heals, range issues, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-21-2009, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed....decide on the strategy and go with it.<br />
<br />
we've had times when we do different things and its harder ! although if its our top healer he never seems to have a problem as i noticed last time we ran it i was running off to hide behind a pillar and the others were not !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-21-2009, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I ended up getting asked to heal Loken on Heroic in HoL last night because the groups healer and 1 dps kept DCing.<br />
<br />
The tank was in a crazy rush and all she said before she pulled was:  &quot;Eating it&quot; then she up and bum-rushed the boss. <br />
<br />
The first time, my comp froze and I didn't get more than a heal off before we wiped.  We raced back in and drank for mana, buffed up and BLAM! Raced into the boss again.<br />
<br />
I don't know how, but I managed to heal through with only one death, but man, it got CLOSE for a few of us.  I remember getting down to about 300-ish HP once before throwing tranquility.  With everyone topped off, and the tranquility ticking once right after Loken threw the next nova at us it wasn't too bad.<br />
<br />
The resto druid that I so admired for being able to heal through this offered a pointer on it...one that I didn't really think of until last night...<br />
<br />
He said he prefers to stand farther away and just eat the tick damage from Loken's DoT ability, since he believes it to be individual- meaning that if you are far away you take more damage, but it doesn't mean more damage for the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
So...the healer then isn't taking the Nova damage...and that leaves only 4 people to top off after the nova instead of 5.  <br />
<br />
-_-  NOW he tells me...lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">07-21-2009, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Grats!  And a cool tip too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From doing it as a hunter I believe that's right. Can't hug up as I can't hurt him, but never noticed me being a couple of yards back unduly hurting everyone else.<br />
<br />
HoL causes all sorts of problems on my PC at the moment so I've not healed it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-22-2009, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok my understanding, which is probably totally wrong :p<br />
<br />
Loken does that AOE looking attack where you see a circle around him that pulses outwards for a couple of seconds ?<br />
<br />
Plus the Nova.<br />
<br />
My understanding was you could be out of range of the AOE, but had to physically go out of LOS, ie behind a pillar to avoid the Nova ? (same as with the big AOE attack Ingvar does when brought back to life ?)<br />
<br />
So ranged dps + healer aim to stay out of range of the AOE but are healed through the Nova - whilst tank and melee have to be healed through it all?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-22-2009, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The nova, as I understand it- cannot be LoS'd.<br />
<br />
Actually, I don't know that any of his moves can be LoS'd.<br />
<br />
His pulsing AoE doesn't seem to do too much damage.  It's that evil evil nova...it one shotted a mage we had taken in with us, and he had 12k HP.<br />
<br />
I would imagine if your healer is OK with you standing a bit farther away as a ranged dps, then that's the way to go.<br />
<br />
If you can stand out of range of his big Nova but still hit him...the tick damage done by his chain lightning and pulse AoE seem that you can easily heal through it.  Throw the melee DPS in there and assuming they have MORE than 14k HP (which they should anyway) then you should be alright.  Healer just has to top them off between novas.  Also, if ranged is far enough away from his nova- there's no need for them to have to stop dpsing to run around.  Life is good =)<br />
<br />
I read up on the fight- and Blizz said it's not meant to be a healers fight.  It's &quot;meant&quot; to be a moving fight where everyone has to run as a group.<br />
<br />
If I run while healing, I fail while healing.  Also, when melee dps is running- that's a dip in DPS- meaning the fight lasts longer- more novas to heal through- more chance of going Oom.  If they eat it, they're still dpsing, assuming you're able to heal them up and not let them die from the nova.  <br />
<br />
Maybe I'll take a group in that's OK with a little experimentation to find out what the easiest/best way is...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-23-2009, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm, i need to read up on it.  when i first started going people said run and hide behind a pillar to escape the nova so you only need to be out of LOS of him ?  (same as the Ikiss in Sethhek).<br />
<br />
in fact we used to initially have him tanked by a pillar so we could all run around quickly to said pillar.....which seemed to work when we were not as welll geared so i believe LOS does work for the nova? (or it did !)<br />
<br />
hmmm we dont tend to move a lot these days.<br />
<br />
dont think we ever go with melee with less than 14k, more like 17k+ and usually 20k+ plus when we have our 2 dk's in the grp.<br />
<br />
take a grp with 2k dps and he's a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
running as healing as druid is not to bad with our HOT's tbh. add in some quick stop nourish and you'll probably be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I'm stuck healing through it constantly.  It's not that bad actually...but...<br />
<br />
The tank last night told me that, while standing farther away from the nova prevents you from getting hit by it- it also causes the group to take more damage...<br />

I haven't been able to find anything to confirm or deny this.  Has anyone run into this?</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression (keep in mind haven't hit H-HoL in months) that there is a party wide damage that ticks on the party while the boss is not using his Nova.  This damage grows exponentially as you get further away.  This is why everyone doesn't stand at max range the entire fight. <br />
<br />
Your distance only impacts the damage you take, not the party.<br />
<br />
If you are going to use the &quot;Heal Through&quot; strat, everyone should hug Loken's ankles the whole fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-24-2009, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, I knew his tick damage got bigger the farther away you were...<br />
<br />
I had not heard, until last night, that the Nova hits X amount harder if there are folks out of range.<br />
<br />
It's possible, I suppose...but as a healer, I'd rather be healing tick damage on myself than a huge chunk of HP while trying to frantically get everyone else topped off again before the next nova.<br />
<br />
Going to have to find a group willing to experiment, I think.  I'll report back with whatever I find out....assuming I find anything out lol<br />

Busy weekend, not a whole lot of time to play.</div></div><hr />

I haven't found any friends that are feeling exceptionally experimental recently...particularly plate-wearing tanks.  Guess I'm gonna have to pony up the dough and offer to pay repair bills to find out lol</div></div><hr />
