Only thing I would ask for is a spells listed by expansion/release date. Ive been away from the druid class for about a year now and its confusing trying to figure out what spells Im missing that are worth getting :)</div></div><hr />

Other than that, it looks great!<br />

Sorry to add on to the end of your message Borras but I don't actually seem to be able to post messages here myself despite being a moderator on this section.<br />
<br />
You can order the topics in the sections by clicking on the title and that will put them into level order, just click &quot;Title&quot; at the top of the column to arrange them.<br />
<br />
You could also use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=7624&quot;&gt;Contents&lt;/a&gt; page to find what you were looking for, all the spells there are divided into sections.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps.<br />

<br />
Druids get more than one line of heals, and that downgrade/upgrade part doesnt take that into account.<br />
<br />
The upgrade to tunare's renewal is karana's renewal, not the crappy nature's touch.  Nature's Touch is actually a downgrade from BOTH chloroblast and Tunare's renewal, being less healing per mana than tunares and practically the same healing/second as cloro, with the downside of waiting 5.5 seconds for anything to be healed at all.<br />
<br />
From 50+ it goes:<br />
Superior Heal&gt;Nature's touch&gt;cloroblast&gt;Nature's infusion&gt;sylvan infusion<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Tunare's renewal&gt;karana's renewal<br />
<br />
just my 2cp<br />

Xarilok,<br />
<br />
The &quot;upgrade&quot; and &quot;downgrade&quot; links aren't really the true upgrade or downgrades to the spells, they are merely the next in that line of spells based off the level requirement for the spell. I contemplated changing them around in the manner you suggested but decided to leave it in a linear level progression format for simplicities sake.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you post a message under the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/forums/showthread.php?t=7434&quot;&gt;&quot;Nature's Touch&quot;&lt;/a&gt; thread and let people know exactly what you've expressed here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">08-01-2004, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a level 61 spell called Entangle listed in the big list.  No information on this spell exists.<br />
<br />
I've never heard of this spell.  Perhaps it should be removed from the list unless it really exists.  If it is a beta spell, that should be noted on it.<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;edit by serberus&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
yeah, that's one of the new spells with Omens of War, I updated the contents hoping I could post the omens of war spells but because I can't make posts at the moment I can't do anything about it. Sent a private message to the admin over a week ago but haven't heard anything yet and still can't post new messages hence tagging this edit on your post.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serberus</div><div class="date">08-13-2004, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lordon,<br />
<br />
You're correct, resist magic is the highest magic resist spell that most classes get, the only exception is Enchanters and Bards (watch somebody prove me wrong).<br />
<br />
As far as druid spells go, Resist Magic is the best we've got to offer.<br />

As I do not have a recent backup of this information I have decided to postpone any updates on this section.<br />
<br />
I will leave it up as a point of reference and so it can be used for discussion but the data will remain inaccurate, I recommend you use the links to the lucy database for accurate information.<br />

Please continue to post your comments and suggestions here.<br />

Many spell entries are currently incorrect in level or description or altogether missing. I'm working though those now, so don't post about those kinds of issues, yet.<br />

Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I'm looking to get my spells, and I'm not sure where/how on a lot of these.  I think if there was a list that listed by expansion it would help me out.  Unless there already is such a list and I just can't find it.<br />
