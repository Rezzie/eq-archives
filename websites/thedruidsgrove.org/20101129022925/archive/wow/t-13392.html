Anyword is its just &quot;pick-a-bear&quot; kind of setup or is it more like the barbershop, where you can mix and match to customize?<br />
<br />
And, anyone else notice we went from 3 claws (per foot) to 4?  I don't really care eitherway, just wondering if that was intentional from some reason.</div></div><hr />

So I'll be a polar bear.  I'm probably the only one who really isn't a huge, huge fan of this.  Not complaining...because yeah, it'll um...well...*shrug* be cooler?<br />
<br />
Destinae and the Technicolor Dire Bear......really?  *shakes head* Polar Bears aren't scary...Raid Bosses are going to see me charging at them and giggle now...lol<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen new kitty models yet though?  I'm hoping they turn my husband's kitty pink.  Or some other random girlie color would work for me... mwahahaha!</div></div><hr />

Hehe, ironically, I want a polar bear form!  But I want pure polar bear, which is why I was hoping we got to customize (so I can remove funky tatoo'ish markings).  In the end, its purely cosmetic, but one could hope!<br />

On a side note, I finally got the misses to sit down and start a WoW toon.  Night one, she was crazy overwelmed (my fault, trying to explain too much too soon) but to my suprise, wanted to keep going the next night!  :bubbrubb2 <br />

I had to ditch my raid group, and pretended to be disappointed.  (Secretly too excited!!!!):wiggle:</div></div><hr />

So why do you guys feel the tauren look is better?  They seemed pretty similar to me; the only difference I really noticed was horns vs. glowing eyes.</div></div><hr />

Tauren look much more aggressive then NE.<br />
That's how fighting bears should look like.<br />
<br />
Another explanation:<br />
Tauren look male.<br />
NE look like the female versions.</div></div><hr />

It's the opposite on the tauren side.<br />

Ah, another joins the ranks of the WoWheads.  What race/class has she chosen Solar?  I've been off working on the blog and researching my other classes lately, so I haven't really been poking around here too much.<br />
<br />
I'm so happy for you!  Soon you'll have an instancing/raiding partner!  Are you leveling a set of alts together?<br />
<br />
Oh, and I still am not a fan of the changes, but I'm definitely not whining about it.  No QQ here.  I'm just partial to how my bear looks after having spent so much time staring at it over the past year+.  I don't really care what the bear LOOKS like, so long as it can still do what it needs to do =)</div></div><hr />

okay, i LOVE the new bear model. The new cat model, not so much. While i'm grateful to blizzard for making the effort to update our drastically out-of-date models, i think i was just expecting more for us cats.<br />
<br />
Although, the bear announcement came as a compete surprise, and i've had a week since they announced it to build my expectations for kittehs... I'm sure that has something to do with it.<br />
<br />
discuss!</div></div><hr />

She didn't really chose, but we both rolled Pallies!  She was a little overwelmed by all the decisions early on, so I just went with a flexible hybrid, she can do what she wants with later.<br />
<br />
Yes, we are leveling together.  Just got to level 18, and finally starting to get the hang of things.  She has no MMO or RPG experience so its all a little much for her atm.  I am a bad teacher too.  I forget how second nature things like movement, aggro management, etc. have become.  Her biggest issue atm is learning to change her camera angle mid fight so she can see whats going on!!! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I'm dissapointed Solar.... &quot;i went with a flexible hybrid, she can do what she wants with later&quot;..... DRUID SOLAR... TAKE THE DRUID!!!!! :D <br />
<br />
But maybe you are right... a paladin is easier to play for beginners... just one side note.... WHY NOT PICK DRUID!!!!! :confused:<br />
<br />
<br />
For me it will be an endless journey for convincing my girlfriend to play! :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, purely selfish reasons....I already have a healthy matured druid, and wanted to start somthing new.  The only class I haven't tried was a Pally/Warlock.  I couldn't roll a pally and have her be a druid, the starting areas are too far apart and don't have trainers for both classes at each (poor design imho). <br />
<br />
<br />
For me it will be an endless journey for convincing my girlfriend to play! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I feel your pain!  Its been 3+ years in the making.  My wife has/had a horrible stereotype of WoW and WoW players.  As far as she is concerned, everyone who plays WoW (except me of course) is a child abusing, neglitive delinquent/adict or a crazed murdering rapist (because everyone on the internet is!!!)  And if she played, she would only fall to the addiction!  Apparently the media has grilled into her head that rolling a WoW toon is like shooting up heroin for the first time and you are doomed to a life of addiction and failure once you start!<br />
<br />
So she is in game, but hasn't said one word to anyone besides me.  IMO, she is still missing the best parts of an MMO, but that will come with time.  Baby-steps!!!  The funniest part, is of the two of us, she is the social butterfly!!!  We go to a house party, and 10mins in she knows everyone and has dinner dates setup with half of them.  Getting past the fact she can't see them, is a big hurdle yet.</div></div><hr />

I was sort of shy to start off...Maybe you should /leave trade and /leave general on her toons though.  If anything reinforces that stereotype...it's GOT to be those channels...at least on my server...Not sure if they do it on your servers...but we get a lot of 10 yr olds thinking they're just ADORABLE posting things like ... well just disgusting things.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the incessant &quot;I'm better than you&quot; crap that goes on in those channels.  I only hit up those /join trade, general or whatever if I'm looking for a group.  Otherwise they're all disabled.  *shrug*  Stupidity irritates me.</div></div><hr />
