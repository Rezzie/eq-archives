If you are looking for a really good mace upgrade I would keep killing prince and get the Light Justice because of the spirit.  I think you will get more benefits from upgrading the rest of your gear rather than spending on the weapon.<br />
<br />
Most of the good healing weapon upgrades comes from raid bosses anything else are missing stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">05-19-2008, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree the mace is missing regen but it was the first thing I bought ( for my resto Shaman ).  I used to have the mace from prince ( never got the one from Maiden even seeing it drop like 10x but someone else always needed it more &gt;_&lt; )<br />
<br />
I really like the increased stam and int, the -20 spirit, while somewhat of an impact shouldn't be all that noticeable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poysonivy</div><div class="date">05-19-2008, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the 3 upgrades you will have 1653 +healing, 161 mp5, 426 int, 448 spi.<br />
<br />
With the Gavel you will have 1717 +healing, 151 mp5, 424 int, 405 spit.<br />
<br />
I'd say go for the 3 above, and get upgrades in KZ while getting more badges for the pants, 100 badges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I'm shooting for.  I think a lot of us have enough regen that we can sacrifice the spirit on our weapons.</div></div><hr />
