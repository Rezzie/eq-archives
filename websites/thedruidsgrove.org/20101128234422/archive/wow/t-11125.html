I'm just curious if any of you feral lovers have played with the feral tree or a combination such as upgrading the current 14/32/5 build or the 0/30/21:<br />
<br />
Here is one I was playing with that is kinda a expansion of what I play now (14/31/5):<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent-bc=0zLVhoZVMxscrdVostV<br />
<br />
The 1st and 2nd tiers are personal preference but would result in the same allocation of 12 points initially.  I could see the value of primal tenacity but not nuturing instinct.  I don't put pts in feral swiftness only because I tend to fight more in dire bear form and utilize the high AC with bash/root to leave fight, heal, re-enter fight.<br />
<br />
Here is another one in the same spirit as the 0/30/21 that allows for NS but at the expense, in this case, of the 41 rather than 31-pt talent:<br />
<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent-bc=MZVMxscRdVosxEcf0Mo<br />
<br />
My only thought on this build is that I'm not sure I would want to exchange Mangle for NS.  With LotP, it was an easier decision.  What I do like is that your not locked into investing in casting time reduction for HT's to get NS. <br />
<br />
Just thought I'd throw a few out, curious what other &quot;ferals&quot; are considering.</div></div><hr />

I'm tentatively looking at this build:<br />

We figure we only really would want one or two if at all, mainly for the aura on the other healers for the few fights we group them together.<br />
<br />
I think it could be fun to figure out how to make it work, kind of like I did when everyone was hating on moonkins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda thinking about something like this:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent-bc=MzLV0oZxhxscMdVxstV<br />
<br />
or maybe just forget about furor alltogether and going with primal tenacity and full feral instinct. Not sure yet :/  I've considered dropping OoC, but I really do love it, yet I love furor too, cause I'm shapeshifting back and forth a lot even raiding, to regain rage fast between pulls or whatnot.  I guess it depends what kind of roll I play in raiding come BC.  Right now I play the offtank/kitty DPS when not tanking/emergency healer when needed on bosses, so shapeshifting's pretty essential.  If I ever get a perm place in offtanking, it'll be easier for me to drop furor.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about dropping imp LotP, but with its lastest buff, I want to at least give it a good try, it just might be awesome for the group I'm in.<br />
<br />
We'll see :)</div></div><hr />

Has EVERYTHING I have now, plus all the new stuff I want, PLUS feline swiftness and natural shapeshifter, which I have missed I admit, since I went full bear and decided to drop 'em.</div></div><hr />

Thats a good point, I have lots of 61 point builds I like now, but I have to decide which are the last ten points I want to grow into as I level.</div></div><hr />

Imp LotP is mostly there to appeal to guilds (I expect guild might be more interested on ferals being feral in end-game raids in BC). Survival of the Fittest and Primal Tenacity arent that important either.. Nurturing Instinct is a must though. Aswell as Predatory Instincts and Mangle. :)</div></div><hr />

Survival of the Fittest is definitely a good talent if you do any tanking for your guild. While not as good as the original 5% crit reduction, even at 3% it is a great talent. It would take 75 defense to equal that reduction, of course without getting the additional benefits of increased dodge from defense.</div></div><hr />

Ya you're right. I think Thick Hide might go before Survival.. I'm just so hung up on armor. :D<br />

Please notice that I'm thinking of dropping Shred alltogether (blasphemy?) when the new Mangle talent is so much better. :D</div></div><hr />

Correcting myself here -- all ranks of NG do indeed work in forms, so it's probably a feature. :)</div></div><hr />
