<br />
So, what exactly do I have to do to get a complete set like<br />

IOW, finding a group to run thru MC a dozen times just ain't gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Check out the Tier 4 -6 sets as they are the &quot;new&quot; sets included in BC.  You obtain these from boss drops in end-game RAIDs (Kara, SSC, Gruul, etc.).  Just look at the wowhead data and it will give you an idea of which boss drops which piece.  Actually, the boss drops a &quot;token&quot; which is used to purchase the item from a vendor.<br />
<br />
There are &quot;Dungeon Sets 1-3&quot; as well.  DS1 and DS2 are old world sets, whereas DS3 is obtain my getting drops from regular 5-man instances in the Outlands.<br />
<br />
Other non-drop items sets exists as well, including those from leatherworkers, tailors, etc.</div></div><hr />

Sadly it seems most of the nice purples are BoP so if your not a LW you are out of luck on them.  I know most of the Feral items I am working on getting are all BoP, not sure about the healing gear items(will make them once I have extra primal's for a back up healer set).</div></div><hr />
