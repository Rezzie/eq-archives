Alla does not have themsplit up making it useless to track down which is which and all other info gives strats up to the Ikkinz Group trials, but does not mess with the raid trials.<br />
 <br />
If anyone knows of a good link for it that would be great! I plan on getting my guild into these.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Few hints:<br />
1) static trash mobs don't respawn, wanderers do.<br />
2) kill the &quot;lesser&quot; bosses first.<br />
3) There will be adds.</div></div><hr />

Most often, at least when I did the Trials, Priest was the needed kill class. Nuke the bejezzus out of those mobs because if the wrong class kills it the dammed thing respawns.<br />
Good Luck, the Ikkinz trials can be alot of fun with a good raid force. =)</div></div><hr />

Glorifiction is Second<br />
Transcendance is Third<br />
Destruction is Fourth<br />
 <br />
Mobs tend to have one of those words, which should help you figure out which Trial they go to.<br />
 <br />
They're adds.<br />
 <br />
You get a intro to at least one new ae, which is known as Rock Storm.  You'll start to see this alot.<br />
 <br />
There are arch-class specfic kills.  Pay attention if it doesn't die the first time.<br />
 <br />
Learn about Infuriate, watch melee who fail to learn die.<br />

Learn about the tradeskill subquests inside of the trials. Pay attention to emotes about everything. The hints are there, believe me.<br />
<br />
Oh yea and prepare to get fun AE Fluxes again :)</div></div><hr />

My guild has been pushing for me to start my monk again instead of druid for the Ikkinz raids and I gave in :( can't wait to start pulling this place!<br />
 <br />
We just got to phase3 of Time on our first PoTime run and I'd love to add Ikkinz on a day in between time.<br />
 <br />
Thank you all for the hints, and yes Hints are funner then spoilers..we had no clue what was going on in P2 of Time and with me pulling it was a blast. P3 was a bitch we did good till one of the pullers who was out w/ mobs got summoned to camp from low health...but we did get 2 gimp time keys hehe<br />
