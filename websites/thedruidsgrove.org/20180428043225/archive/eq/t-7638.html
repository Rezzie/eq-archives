Which Plains are open to me, which ones are keyed and not accesable to me (I'm not in a POP guild)? I've looked through the threads, can't find anything that's definative as to tactics to use while soloing and where, and where to avoid for that matter.<br />

<br />
at 46 you will gain access to : Disease, Innovation, Nightmare, Justice<br />
at 55 you will gain access to : Storms, Valor, Torment, Crypt of Decay.<br />
at 62 you will gain access to : Bastion of Thunder, Halls of Honor.<br />
<br />
As far as soloing effectively in the planes, you will probably want to wait until 52, when you get Call of Karana.  You can then move to having ravens take on stalkers in Nightmare, or rats taking on flies in Disease. <br />
<br />
You can solo goo's and such near the bone wall in Disease as well, but I wouldn't reccomend it until at least 53 when you get winged death, and also have es vambs (at least) and epic (if you're lucky, didn't get mine till 60).<br />
<br />
You will hear people tell you that you can quad flies in Disease, but let me tell you that you honestly won't want to until you have our next quadding nuke or better.  Even then the exp is craptastic at best, and quadding gets boring and stops being challenging after so long.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm different, but since I enjoy new challenges, I find quadding boring, especially after raptors and wyverns.</div></div><hr />
