It's been a while since i posted here and as i read through the &quot;new posts&quot;(2 days or so) and i see that a lot is going on :wavey: <br />
<br />
My question:<br />
Does Mongoose proc now in bear-form too?<br />
Cause that would make it a nice tanking-enchant for your main-weapon. In terms of Aggro and Mitigation.<br />
<br />
Roarrr!!!</div></div><hr />

I have not tried it yet because I was under the impression the +35 agi was still better.  I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

With all the raid haste buffs, item haste, and the proc I can get my bear swing timer down to an even 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Off topic, but here's a fun bear tank story for a couple nights ago. We were slumming in Tempest Keep to get the Kael achievement for some folks. Our old Warrior MT is switching to a Ret pally for Wrath so I am taking over MT duties as a bear. Obviously I can't use the shield so we knew the possibility for singed bear was likely if a pyroblast got off.<br />
<br />
Needless to say it happened... Kael winds up to cast and I can tell I'm toast, but I figure what the hell, I might as well see if I can pop everything I have and try and live through it. Up goes survival instincts; up goes barkskin; up goes my hands clasped in prayer... boom, down goes the bear. I nearly pulled it off, though. I ended up resisting half of it and the extra health left me about 2k short of surviving. Maybe next time, lol, but at least we ended up killing him.</div></div><hr />

With survival instincts I was sitting at about 31k in the kael raid. I could have had a little bit more if I gemmed 100% for stamina and used a second stamina trinket. I also could try to use something like a Nightmare Seed (assuming it stacks) to push me over the top. <br />
<br />
With the seed and loading up all the sta I can I think it's survivable. Also, I only have 1 piece tier 6 so far and a mix of tier 5 etc. If you had a full tier 6 set gemmed for sta you'd be that much higher</div></div><hr />

I raided as resto pre-TBC, and since it went live I've spent everyday being feral.  I must say when I first logged in after the patch and saw the nerf to bear form and the bonus armor on most of my gear I was extremely upset.  I was capped out in dmg reduction.  After giving it a go and seeing all the other nice things they've done for us, it's not so bad.  Wouldnt really call it a nerf just being fine tuned a bit.  <br />
<br />
Still plan on leveling boomkin to 80 though.</div></div><hr />
