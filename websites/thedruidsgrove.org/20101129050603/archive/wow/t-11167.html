<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kisman</div><div class="date">10-11-2006, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started WoW on a PvP server so I think I know where your coming from.  It's rough from about 30-60.  Probably more so at 60 when your trying to get better geared.  But since you grow up with getting ganked and beat on there's a good chance most people will take that out on others when they grow up.  Only you can stop the cycle!  When I was 50 I remember going back to STV to assist the 30-40's in leveling, if a horde was causing to much trouble I would track him down and kill him, I would not kill anything grey to me that offered no honor though or kill someone who just barely won a fight that's just cruel.  <br />
<br />
I transfered to a PvE server at 54 though so I have no idea how 60 plays out on a PvP server I'm just assuming.  I cannot imagine doing the sithilis quests or even gathering at MC on a PvP server though, the gank fest must be amazing.  <br />
<br />
So in closing yes I agree with you, they shouldn't do it, but on the other hand I see why some of them do.</div></div><hr />

Deal with it or go roll on a care-bear PvE server.  Ganking is part of the game.  <br />

The only times I've been ganked is about 10-15 times in STV...the other times they would leave me alone or I would travel form and run away :)<br />
<br />
Trust me, it's fun to get back at other lowbies when you're the one who's 60 in the future...but I personally don't do it too often.</div></div><hr />

I left it there because I think it's hilarious.</div></div><hr />

Difference is you have a choice of when you want to be involved in PVP and when you don't.  Being ganked and then returning the favor when your  high level...thats just dumb.  I play WoW to be the character and enjoy the world and rp it, so honor takes a large role in my actions.  So I see ganking as an act of evil or spite characteristic of perhaps a rogue or warlock.  A lvl 60 should not care about a lvl 20, just as in RL, I would not go to some elementry school during recess and start pushing around the 5th graders.  I'm 35 yrs old.  LOL - and I'm not evil.</div></div><hr />
