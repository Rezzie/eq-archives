I noticed that you also have removed the old requirement that you need to first spend 6 AA in general before being able to spend any AA in archetype and that you need to spend 12 AA in archetype before you can spend any AA in class.<br />
Is this an oversight or do you really intend to remove those long standing basic requirements? <br />
It was intentionally removed.  We viewed it as an archaic requirement that doesn't really mean much in today's game and it was causing problems with the ability to the AAs down into the three main categories.<br />

OR can we still only store 30 AA's before we must spend some? I heard a rumor it was being raised to 50, just curious.</div></div><hr />
