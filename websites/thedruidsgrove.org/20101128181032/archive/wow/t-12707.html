<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">06-28-2008, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys.  Just wanted to apologize for all the spam posts lately, especially the non-work safe ones.  I move them as soon as I see them, but there have been a lot lately and sometimes it takes me a while to get to them.<br />
<br />
I'm also going to see if there's anything we can do to try to cut them off closer to the source, so that we don't get so many popping up.<br />
<br />
Please also report these posts when you see them by clicking the &quot;Report Post&quot; button at the bottom left of the post. (It looks like a white triangle with an exclamation point, fringed in red.) Reporting a post will notify the moderators.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

One strategy would be to have a &quot;bot&quot; forum, a honeytrap with a low F number specifically designed to attract the bots.<br />
You could make this forum only viewable by people with the lowest post counts, that way registered users who have been here a while won't even see it.<br />
<br />
Bit of a roundabout solution I guess but I've seen it used effectively before..  the idea of a forum just for bot chat is kinda funny as well :p<br />

<br />
My employer uses Cycrest for it's filter, and currently it's setting on this computer is set to its lowest, there have been times where i go to another discussion forum on another computer, and cycrest has flagged it for pr0n... kinda embarrasing when i'm trying to go to a sportbike discussion board :(</div></div><hr />
