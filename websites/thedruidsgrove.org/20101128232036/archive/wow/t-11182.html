I was looking at this tree this morning in an exercise of &quot;if I had to....&quot;<br />
<br />
Interesting enough, I came up with a build that takes a great deal of the balance talents into account but stops after the Moonkin Tier as I don't have alot of confidence in the treant summoning every 3 mins and I don't have alot of +damage gear at the moment.  I also put some points in the feral side to be able to OT or drop into dire bear for survivability in the event I would go OOM.<br />

Curious as what others have pondered in the balance tree or the combination of balance with other trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Generally if you are going to take furor, you want it full.  Whne you need to drop and charge someone you need it definitely, not likely.<br />
<br />
I would say think about what you want to be doing as your playstyle.  If you are a cloth feather and like to attack from range, all those points in feral are pretty much wasted.  If you are a panzerkin and intend to slug it out, you'd probably still be better off putting the points in resto for more melee damage from naturalist and free spells from OOC.<br />
<br />
The only way I see moonkin investing in feral would be if you really wanted to try to max the meleekin thing by getting moonkin, predatory strikes, and OOC; or 32/18/11.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I anticipate 90% of moonkins will go 44/0/17 or something close to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was really just posting to see what others were thinking as I'm more apt to sticking with feral myself.  Got similar feedback about the feral talents as well as the need for IS if taking the balance tree.<br />
<br />
Being a resident moonkin, you thinking of making a return or sprouting into a tree of life to continue raiding?</div></div><hr />
