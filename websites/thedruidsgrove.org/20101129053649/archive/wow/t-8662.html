<br />
One very bad time to do this is if you get kidney shotted by a rogue while in bear, and then try to go caster to get a root up right away. You'll shift, but stand there with way less HP while he wails on you until the stun wears off.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to fix the timing on some things too. If polymorph gets timed right I can be morphed right after I go into bear form. I hear the sounds, see the puff of smoke, and lose the mana for morphing, but I still get sheeped. A hunter can do the same thing w scare-beast. If I morph back to humanoid at a specific moment, he will land his fear beast on my caster.<br />

Hibernate is great vs hunter pets, and vs druids it lets you bandage and land a sweet starfire (or build up your cat energy).</div></div><hr />

Its really hard to channel through a pet and arrows hitting you all at once.  Barkskin really helps there though if you have quick fingers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aitrus</div><div class="date">04-18-2005, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep. hunters are verrrrrry easy for a druid. As soon as he attacks run towards him, throwing up rejuvenation and barkskin. Root the hunter, then hibernate the pet. I used to mess around trying without bark, but now I realize this is a very practical use for the spell in pvp (I find its the pet that causes the most grief for casting tho, not so much the arrows)<br />

If anything bad happens along the way, nature's swiftness + healing touch will buy you the time you need.<br />

If he uses the cheezy mana-drain, put abolish poison on.</div></div><hr />
