You get full value from CCoM because there's no recommended level.  Allakhazam is wrong (again).</div></div><hr />

That's math.  If I'm right your weapon would act as if it were 22 delay instead of 34.  ( 36% haste,  so 34-36%, or 100-36=64, so 34x0.64 = 21.76, your new delay speed. )</div></div><hr />

new delay = 34 divide (1 + 0.36) = 25  (2.5 sec)</div></div><hr />
