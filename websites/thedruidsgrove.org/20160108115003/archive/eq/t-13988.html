<br />
I'm aware of several raid options that open up around the 60+ area but I've got a new guild of sorts of just RL friends.  We have about 12 characters amongst the group of 8 RL people and a variety of classes but all lvl 50-51 right now.  None of us did a cash dump for bazaar gear so any one of our toons is &quot;ok&quot; geared (tanks around 3.5-4k buffed, 2k-ish mana on casters, etc).  All core classes are covered (2 clerics, shm, enc, bard, etc etc).<br />
<br />
I'm curious to know what the folks here (having been a long time member I value this forum memberships input), on what you all think is available for &quot;raid&quot; targets to this group I mention.  We can't raid in any PoR or later content (not all the accounts upgraded).<br />
<br />
I've done a fair bit of checking on Alla (but don't have premium) so any advice to offer would be great.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If you have enough L52 or lower chars, could try vox / naggy.  However, some people with twinked 52 alts 2-3 box them on some servers.<br />
 <br />
Another idea would be servitor of luclin in GE (he isn't killed often on most servers.) Perhaps rhags in ssra as well.  Va`dyn 'may' be possible, but with would be a very long fight, your healers might not be able to last.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rhags, SoL etc are all level 63, so you want to be upper 50s proably before attempting them.<br />

Illia's notes are at http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11126 .  If Wrank is too easy, you could try his boss, Overlord Ngrub, in the same zone, http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=11125 .  I wish you good hunting.</div></div><hr />
