Returning to game after being gone for 2 years.  I see the information the the &quot;Druids returning here&quot; thread above and was wondering if someone would be able to fix the links in the thread.  Most of it is void as of now.  Also, appears this is the only forum that gets any attention, most of the other section have not been posted in well...a long time.<br />
<br />
After being gone so long, and having gear that's considerably sub-par, it's very difficult to even &quot;know where to begin&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help someone might be able to offer.</div></div><hr />

EQ itself is dying, so, of course, this site is suffering.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, this still is THE druid site.<br />
<br />
I still play EQ sometimes but it is hard to bring the enthusiasm I used to have to the game.  Without that energy, updating this site and other stuff is harder for people to get around to doing.</div></div><hr />

This has been answered a few times.<br />
<br />
New server, different structure yada yada yada.<br />
<br />
However, the post numbers remain the same, so if you take the post number from the end of a 'broken' link and manually put it at the end of a current one (like the one in your address bar now) you'll get to the info you're looking for.<br />
<br />
So for example if you want the Post-GoD Equipment Paths For Returning Druids link to work - take the post number whiuch was 14363 and paste it in above instead of the current post (233089) and away you go.<br />
<br />
Search is your friend.<br />
<br />
Enjoy</div></div><hr />

We're still reevaluating the gear progression in light of what SoF has to offer.  For starters, the new (tradeable!) cultural armor blows away anything previously available in the visible armor slots.</div></div><hr />
