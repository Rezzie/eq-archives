What are the min specs (mana pool, in combat MP5, +sp) I should have before trying to heal easier heroics (Nexus, UK)?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, it depends on the skill and the gearing of the group you're healing for too.  The better geared they are, the easier the healing is.<br />
<br />
Currently, (stats below) I don't have problems with the easy heroics, rarely any with the moderate ones, but occasionally run into issues with the hardest ones.  Usually related to the rest of the party, not necessarily any shortcomings on my part. No, really. ;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feral spec'd with healing kit on I have ~1150 +healing, 800 int.  I don't recall my out of combat MP5 or my exact mana pool.  Maybe I'll respec tonight and take a look at my &quot;real&quot; numbers.  As I know some of the Feral talents inflate a portion of those numbers, which means MP5 and Int can be a bit lower after I respec.</div></div><hr />

WowArmory puts my in combat regen at 220.  Buffed I think I've seen 250ish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
+healing: 1283<br />
MP5: 690/221<br />
Mana: 15.6K<br />
Crit: 6.82%<br />
Haste: 4.27%<br />
Int: 828<br />
Spr: 835<br />
Health: 14.2K<br />
<br />
That's from 2-3 crafted items, 1 rep item, 1-2 drops (while tanking), quest rewards (thru 1/3 of ZD) and several top notch world drops (AH buys).<br />
<br />
Too much MP5/int/spr and not enough +heal?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe not the toughest heroics with a relatively undergeared/experienced group, but otherwise, yeah.  Go for it.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can run with a shammie - &lt;3 Totem of Wrath - +280 SP.  I had one last night for hGundrak, wow was it nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SP: 1452 (not in tree, unbuffed)<br />
MP5: 762/275 (unbuffed)<br />
<br />
I'm not confident to do the harder heroics yet.  Probably most of my regular groups really not ready for it.  Everyone needs to be good, not just the healer.</div></div><hr />

SP &gt;1350<br />
MP5 (IC) &gt;225<br />
MP &gt; 12,000<br />
HP &gt; 10,000<br />
<br />
For almost all of the &quot;tough&quot; heroics, the healing difficulty is going to depend on your group more than you.  They are tough, because they require coordination, and strategy.  <br />
<br />
As a druid, you can cleanse poison, so most of your &quot;tough&quot; heroics are not quite as tough as previously thought.  Get healbot, and learn to love it!</div></div><hr />

I like Rhus's Spec.  How is it for soloing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">01-07-2009, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soloing is... doable.  Not quick but I get the job done.  Looking back I really notice a difference in kill speed as my SP increases.  Last night I had ~1750 self buffed.<br />
<br />
Since hitting 80 I haven't done that much questing, I used Jame's guides for Borean Tundra, Howling Fjord and Dragonblight (hit 80 at the end of DB), and have skipped the rest to focus on the quest chains that give the reps I want - Oracles, Sons of Hodir mostly at this time.  Doing the dailies for those reps has not been difficult.  I'm sure it will go faster once dual specs come and I can rip through dailies using the kitty set that I've been accumulating while healing, though.  Given my &lt;3 for 5-man healing, I wish all reps were championable. Oh  well.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that I'd be more efficient killing with my current gear using a heavier Balance spec, but I like my Resto toys, and there's really not enough that I'd give up to be able to get to the Balance toys.  I just enjoy the feral dps style better than caster dps. And I'm too cheap to respec twice a week. :whistle:</div></div><hr />

i am right there with you, so much so. i spend far too much money on respeccing.</div></div><hr />
