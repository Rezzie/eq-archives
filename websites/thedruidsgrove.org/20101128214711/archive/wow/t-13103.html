<br />
I was reading some of the strats for killing the frost dragon in Naxx-10 and they said that the tank should stay in full tanking gear because you didn't want to sacrifice tanking stats in favor of extra stam/resist.  <br />
<br />
My question is, are bears the exception to this rule?  The polar set still offers the same armor, we are still uncrittable (talents) and increase the HP pool, while reducing incoming frost damage pretty significantly.<br />
<br />
I can see why other tanks cannot afford to lose their soft crit cap, but bears don't worry about that.  So should I Polar up or no?</div></div><hr />

We take 3 healers and our MT is a druid.  We're going to try our Pally soon since our druid can do more damage than the pally can.  Anyways, our druid does NOT put on the frost resist set.  He can make it, and had we not killed Sapph on our first night in there he may have made it for himself.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd take a wait and see attitude.  Hit him up for a night without frost resist and see how it works for your raid, you may find it works out fine.<br />
<br />
From a healer PoV, the damage to the tank has never been much of an issue, the problem comes in with the blizzards and the regular frost aura dmg that the raid takes.  Oh..and of course the ice blocks hurt too &gt;_&lt;.</div></div><hr />

It will cost you a little dodge, but that loss is more than offset by decrease in aura damage and blizzard damage you will take.  (You stay in the blizzard if you are tanking, you don't move Sapph.)<br />
<br />
I made my raid all get the new FrR gear before we went in there.  It's very cheap to make and it makes the fight far easier on the healers, especially on your first attempt.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Your overall damage taken should decrease, and you'll get a health bump probably.<br />
<br />
I'd have to look long and hard before swapping an epic for a polar piece, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">12-30-2008, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mitigation lost (dodge) from T7 epic gear (10-man) vs Polar Set is minimal, and the HP boost is nice.  The resist set does reduce your AoE damage considerably, but the set is NOT required.  <br />
<br />
It is simply a matter of how much do you want to help your healers.  I have to agree with Oiys though, its cheap.  I say why not.  <br />
<br />
Again, its not required, but helpful.  T7 gear is supremely underpowered for bears.  So I wouldn't sweat swapping it out from time to time.</div></div><hr />
