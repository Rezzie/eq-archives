Woot!  We were just talking about you in a thread.  I think the post was last week.  Funny.<br />
<br />
Damn, that IS strange - and a bit scary. But I love it that life is full of coincidences like that ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
are you now an ex wow player ?<br />
<br />
Nope, still playing :) . Not so much in the past 3 or 4 months, though. My raid group broke up (two thirds through BT and Hyjal, no less) and I had a lot of real life stuff to deal with (founded my own company with some friends). That's why I played less and less each week, and at some point stopped completely. <br />
<br />
But I am really looking forward to WotLK, and am keeping up-to-date on things happening in beta.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I started a druid blog, if some of you are interested. Link is in my sig. Feedback (positive and negative) is always welcome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i found your explanation of basics mechanics etc useful as i dont get much time to delve into forums/official posts on all the changes.  nor do i understand it all !<br />
<br />
i'll just be seeing us tanks losing lots of armour on items etc and being sad/unhappy !<br />
<br />
so i need stuff laid out for me in simple to understand terms ;)</div></div><hr />
