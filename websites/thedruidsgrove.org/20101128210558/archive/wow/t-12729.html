I was thinking about the head and shoulders.  It would allow me to finally get a ring of the stalwart protector, and change the enchant on my chest to stats.  My guild has downed only Void Reaver so far as T5 bosses go, so only the shoulders would be available to me atm anyway.  Hard to believe that BG PVPing could yield comparable/better gear.  Is this right?  What am I missing?</div></div><hr />

On the flip side, Survival of the fittest is being changed from reducing your crit chance by 1/2/3% to 2/4/6%, which means (currently) you would not need any extra defense or resilience to be uncrittable against +3level mobs. Druids in that respect are going to be able to have huge flexibility in their gear and not need resilience.</div></div><hr />

so can i use honour from BG's and buy the s3 or s4 sets as they are obviously a step up again from the s2 items i have just purchased ?<br />

how likely is that to remain as the final talent.....seems like if druids were to get that ability warriors and pallys would not be too happy....?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should get 2pc T5 anyway, even if you don't wear it for tanking.<br />
Having an instant cast heal as a feral druid opens up all sorts of possibilities, such as easily soloing fel reavers, being utterly invincible in pvp, and saving your rogs' lives at the last possible moment :&gt;<br />
It is a hugely fun set bonus.  Remember it reduces the casting time of your regrowth spell by 2.0 seconds, and regrowth has a 2.0 cast time in the first place... so basically it just makes the spell instant cast.<br />
<br />

Heh, I'm sure they'll suck it up, like they always do =P<br />

Right now, plate tanking gear is for two spec. In the xpac it'll be for 3. Making plate tanking gear is as a rule not a waste because of this. <br />
<br />
But there's only one spec of one class that needs leather tanking gear. Doing this means that for the most part, rogues and feral druids can share exactly the same gear without issue. It's fine giving warriors, paladins and druids the liability of being crittable because their gear is itemized to remove that liability. It's problematic for druids because it's not. Removing the problem entirely neatly solves this for everyone. Even if rogues and ferals get different gear, it means that feral gear can work well as both cat and bear gear. Essentially, it takes the current tier gear itemization and makes it great for both forms, which is ideal.  <br />
<br />
It's also a good move because of how defense works; because druids cannot block or parry, defense is massively inefficient by comparison to a warrior, pally or death knight. This is why resilience is so good for a druid in the first place; losing defense just isn't losing all that much.<br />
<br />
I very much expect this to stay in.</div></div><hr />

When S5 comes out, you will be able to buy S1, S2 and S3 gear with honor, while S4 and S5 require arena points.  <br />
 <br />
Essentially you can always purchase two seasons 'old' or 'older' gear with honor.  Currently S1 costs less honor than S2, and S3 costs less arena points than S4.<br />
 <br />
Annikk - I've always wanted to play around with the 2pc T5 set bonus on my Druid.  Looks like a ton of fun, and way OP for solo'ing.  Kinda useless (compared to T4 2pc) for 25man raiding (all the T5 2pc are kinda weak imo), but nonetheless, I love it.  I also liked the set bonus on moonglade that added dodge to rejuv... anyone else think that was a good idea?</div></div><hr />

I assume when S5 comes out the level cap will be 80, so S3 gear won't be all that useful.  So, S5 is more like S1v2.  Maybe blizzard will make a lvl 80 starter PvP set that you buy with PvE rep like they did a few patches back with the lvl 70 starter pvp sets.</div></div><hr />

With this next Xpac, there have quite a few changes that simplify gear stats (no more +heal and/or +spell, there will be +power or something like that).  +res doesn't work in PvE.  Maybe Blizzard folks are getting lazy.  Or maybe this plays into the rumors that we will be allowed to have 2 talent specs.  Being able to switch from spec A to spec B would demand a boatload of new gear for each player, but with overlap in gear spec's not so much (+power gear will work for Trees as well as Chickens).<br />
<br />
Even recent patchs in BC, Blizzard has been leaning this way as seen in the patch that allows +heal to &quot;convert&quot; to +spell and the patch that changed HotW to buff AP instead of +str so we could wear more Rogue gear.<br />
<br />
Though, in a way, this might mean there will be more folks rolling on the same piece of gear.  IMO, the fewer DE's the better.  So, it ain't all that bad.</div></div><hr />

cheers Clar.<br />
<br />
so have i bought the S2 gear then ?   sorry not a clue when it comes to pvp !<br />
<br />
just about to buy either the gloves or chest from the same set of which i currently have the 2 items i listed in a post above somewhere....<br />
<br />
from other posts do i assume S5 is a long way off and will be after WotLK ?</div></div><hr />

The old stuff -even S4 gear - will be way behind the curve compared to lvl 80 pve gear, so they'll have to add new sets and stuff anyway.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Khel right now if you don't want to do arenas (and I don't blame ya... too cookie cutter), then S2 set gear is the best you can get pvp-wise.  <br />
 <br />
Just to confuse things, you can get S3 boots belt bracers ring and neck from honor as well (Vindicator's gear).</div></div><hr />

to confuse things even more, the Guardian stuff is out now, which is S4 equivalent... you can pick up the belt and the neck without needing an arena rating</div></div><hr />
