<br />
I don't do nearly as well feral spec, where I cannot seem to win a one-on-one fight.  Any help for a helpless noob?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Are feral druids considered pvp viable?  I looked on elitist jerks and there's a resto druid pvp thread but not a pvp-specific one for boomkins or feral druids.<br />

I could definitely be better at it, as you could probably see from my arena ratings if you check me out on the armory...<br />
<br />
Feral druids are definitely viable in PvP, especially for 2v2's with another melee class... the biggest problem on my 2v2 team is that my partner is spec'd prot and doesn't bring a whole lot of damage to the table (im not lyin! check out his talent tree!)<br />
<br />
it really depends on what class you're fighting one-on-one as to which plan of attack is best... bleeds are pretty effective on warriors and rogues, and bear form attacks will knock the snot out of squishies... pallies at this point, are the class that give me the biggest headache 1-on-1, that and resto shammies :( that &quot;purge&quot; really pisses me off<br />
<br />
my 3v3 and 5v5 experience isn't that extensive, and i've been asked to spec resto for my 5v5 team, which i'll do if i can get a solid commitment from them one night a week... <br />
<br />
in bg's i usually score 3rd or 4th highest in killing blows... i've never been at the TOP, but have come in 2nd a couple of times...</div></div><hr />

Season 3 is when Blizz finally got the gear right for feral druids... i've seen feral druids fully decked out (including staff and shoulders) in S3 gear score at the top of BG's in killing blows :)</div></div><hr />

Not exactly true Skwidrific.  I compete for top 3 in AV with killing blows when I'm not defending towers or mines.  My armor is mostly S1 (I can't find an arena team that has atleast 150 resilience per person).</div></div><hr />

I don't worry too much about stunlocking as much as bleed effects and a well-timed Bash, FC or Maim to pop off a rejuv or HT... I've found that i can burn through some Mana (not to mention cd on bash) trying to keep someone stunlocked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">06-19-2008, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting top in KB's isnt that hard to do if you are around the action and time things well.  <br />
 <br />
All the time on my warrior I get top KB's with like 1/2 to 1/3 the damage of hunters / warlocks / rogues cause I'll just charge / intercept around to targets that are at like 25% health and spam execute and MS.  <br />
 <br />
Based on that, KB's dont mean much.  It's all about burst damage and CC.  Feral Charge --&gt; Bash a healer, root a melee dps, cyclone a ranged dps, then go back to shredding the hunter you and your rogue friend are killing, then move on to the cycloned target, as cyc wears off cyc the bashed healer and re-root the melee, etc. etc.<br />
 <br />
As far as one-on-one fights as feral, remember to use your forms effectivley, and look for opportune moments to heal yourself.  You will very rarely win a fight against a pure dps class if you just both try to burn each other.  Take your time, whittle them away, and when you get a chance Maim, Bash, NG or use any of your other 'escape' mechanics and re-hot yourself.  If possible, go into the fight with maybe a rejuv and lb ticking.  Always FF your target, and if you are in Bear, demo roar doesn't hurt either.  And on that note, dont be afraid to drop out of kitty into bear.  Mangle still hits hard as tuffbare.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">06-26-2008, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Beyond gear considerations, pvp is about playing fast.  Faster than your enemy.  Second guessing what your enemy will do next.  Knowing when to run, when to charge, when to CC and when to heal yourself or your partner(s), and making these decisions quickly and correctly.<br />
<br />
People may tell you feral is not viable for pvp, but that's good - it will just make victory sweeter.  So stop worrying so much about whether you're barking up the wrong tree.  Gear up.  Focus.  Shift and stealth and prepare to fill the mighty shoes of a BIOLOGICAL WEAPON.<br />
