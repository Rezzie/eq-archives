I hate BM with a passion and with the lack of mana breaks available, I find it a rather stressful instance to heal.  So, I was not at all heart-broken when I dropped the quest and opted for Master of Potions instead.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-15-2008, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Potion mastery is a good choice.  There aren't a lot of potion masters around, as most people choose elixirs due to the double-flask-procs, or transmute due to the ease of acquiring it.<br />
<br />
I'm told that for 80g you can unlearn one mastery and learn a new one - you don't need to do the quests for it, you just get given it, in exchange for 80g.  So if you decide you'd still rather be elixir, that's an easy way to change to it :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
A few notes on each.<br />
Transmute mastery is like the national lottery.  Chances are you won't get many procs, but when you do it's serious happy days :&gt;  Primal Might x 5 is pretty awesome really..<br />
<br />
Potion mastery is sought after a lot by other alchemists as it tends to be the rarest of the masteries.  You will make a lot of discoveries off the back of other peoples' combines, but if you do discover flasks it would still be better to get some elixir master to make them for you, in case they get a double.<br />
<br />
Elixir mastery is the hardest of the mastery quests, but potentially the most rewarding as double flasks are an awesome bonus.  There is LOADS of money to be made from playing the elixir market.  Just watch the prices of the different herbs and potions for a few days to get a feel for the fluctuations, then start buying herbs that are at outstandingly low prices, and sell elixirs when the average price is up high, or there are none in the AH.<br />
5 x Elixir of Healing Power sells for up to 18g on my server.  The mats for this costs me about 4g.  Even before you start getting double procs, that's already a heap of money.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am an elixir master, and although it was difficult to get (took me 5 Black Morasses) it was definitely worth it in the end.  I am an extremely active alchemist and I can make every flask in the game.  I make thousands of gold worth of elixirs every month, and I hand the vast majority out in raids and instances, for free.  Despite this I still make loads of money from it, and as a bonus I've cultivated a reputation of &quot;the cat who gives everybody drugs&quot;.  I find alchemy/herbalism to be the most enjoyable, fulfilling profession I have ever tried, and given the flasks I've learned how to make I definitely wouldn't change to anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
One good option would be to go as potion master initially, then switch to elixirs once you discover your first flask.  Or you might find you enjoy potions more, in which case stick with that. :&gt;<br />

<br />
finally dropped chanting and am now a money making flower picker !<br />
<br />
sold about 150g of herbs quickly last night.<br />
<br />
about 6 stacks of golden sansam / dreamfoil.<br />
<br />
getting 20-30g a stack on these atm for running around Azshara - which is now empty - my god how it differs from pre-BC when it was over run with herb farmers....same in Felwood / SoS and anywhere else i decide to revisit.<br />
<br />
i found herby incredibly easy to level to.<br />
<br />
maybe i need to go for alchemy......<br />
<br />
although as someone who will not be high end raiding anymore will i get the benefit of good potion recipes and the ability to make money ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">01-29-2008, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes.  I love it.  <br />
<br />
Potions and Elixirs will make you fairly decent gold, and the mats are easily acquired. <br />
<br />
Flasks make a ton of money, however, they are also expensive to make if you don't have the mats.  Fel Lotus has been known to drop from various herbs.  Just keep it aside whenever you are lucky enough to have one drop for you,  and before you know it, you've got the mats for a Flask worth about 45g.<br />
<br />
With Alchemy / Herbalism, aside from the vials, it costs nothing for standard recipes, and it's a sure sell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">01-30-2008, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Kheldar Alchemy is an excellent profession, both for making money and for pimping your ride.  For pvp or 5man instances or even just grinding, it will stand you in good stead.<br />
The only thing it can't help with is arenas.  We aren't allowed to use potions in arenas :&lt;  But that's a minor detail imho.<br />
<br />
It's also the by far the most satisfying and fulfilling profession I have tried.  To date I have had an engineer, miner, leatherworker, skinner, enchanter, and finally herbalist and alchemist.  Herbalism and Alchemy are miles better in every way.<br />
<br />
<br />
In terms of making money from Alchemy, these days I buy cheap herbs off the AH and make them into elixirs.  Then I sell the elixirs on the AH for massive profit - they sell extremely well and very quickly, especially around raid times during midweek when lots of people need potions for their raids, but don't have time to farm them for themselves.<br />
<br />
I use the money from the sale of those elixirs to buy more herbs, and to buy fel lotuses to make flasks.<br />
These days I hand out literally dozens of flasks to my guildies every week, and yet I am still very much financially solvent - I actually make something in the region of 500g a week, my guildies absolutely love me for all the free stuff they get, and to top it off the whole thing is just so much fun :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
When you get flight form, I'd recommend getting some kind of addon to alter your minimap so you can have it nice and big, and nearer the middle of your screen.  Then you can just fly around, pick herbs, and you don't even need to constantly look in the top right of your screen to see if a herb is nearby - the minimap is right in front of you.  It's very relaxing, therapeutic even..  I've been known to just fly around picking herbs for many hours at a time, and when my bags are full I make my way back to the city and manufacture DRUGS!  ^_^<br />

<br />
maybe i should just make the decision. also with exalted on a few reps i'm hoping i might get the odd decent alchy recipe ?<br />
<br />
am finding Azeroth better for herbs than Outland as well.....with the bonus that everything is so many levels lower than me you dont end up having to stop and kill mobs to get to herbs.<br />
<br />
obviously i'm not getting the 'new' herbs but dreamfoil and golden sansam are very good sellers. people also seem to pay a lot for mountain silversage and plaguebloom.<br />
<br />
thanks for the thoughts....</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you get exalted with the Violet Eye (Karazhan rep), you can make a nice druid flask called the Flask of Chromatic Wonder.<br />
This gives +18 all stats, +35 all resists, for 2 hours.  The resists stack with auras and other buffs (I have tested this).  Like all flasks, it persists through death.<br />

working on Sha'tar next because there is some Aldor bloke in the bank in Shatt who talks about the best rewards to people with exalted rep for Aldor / CE and Sha'tar......<br />

These work the same as normal flasks, except that they are soulbound when you buy them and they only work if you're in SSC, TK, Mount Hyjal or Black Temple.<br />
<br />
They cost 1 x Mark of the Illidari each.<br />
These are little token things that drop from the trash in the above-mentioned raid instances.<br />

During that period my friend and I herbed like crazy.  At one point he came round to my house and we went at it for 48 hours straight, sleeping in shifts and taking turns to roll with IRL sungrass =)  Burning the candle at both ends, so to speak.<br />

That weekend I spent over 250g on imbued vials, and made 2 discoveries.  Even considering how many combines we did, I still consider that pretty lucky...<br />

<br />
Flying around at random, picking flowers... and manufacturing vast quantities of drugs, is so fun and relaxing. :&gt;  And during the pre-nerf time it was doubly-awesome because of all the crazy tricks you could do with it.  Did you know for example that if a 70 caster mob was standing _exactly_ on the flower, you could drop straight down on it (by pressing X), start picking the flower, then fly straight up again (by pressing spacebar), and the &quot;herb collecting&quot; cast bar would continue to move up.  I would fly way up out of range of the caster mob, and it would deaggro.<br />
Provided you flew back down again and hit the ground _just_ as the cast bar completed, you would still pick the herb.  Moving while herbing = awesome :P<br />

<br />
1- go and choose Pot Mastery asap. create pots etc and save your elixir mats for later.try to find an elixir master friend to do elixirs for you DO NOT CRAFT YOUR OWN ELIXIRS AND FLASKS for now.<br />
<br />
2- Stay until you have discovered some useful Flasks like i did (i discovered a lot of flasks before crafting any)<br />
<br />
3- when you have enough mats to do a few (about 10-20) flasks go and respec to Elixir Mastery, craft all of your flasks, elixirs use every elixir and flask mats.<br />
<br />
Now you have a few more options. one of it is the respec back to pot mastery so you can craft a lot of potions every day and you can have  a lot of &quot;discovery chance&quot; (i have discovered all of my flasks with Super Mana Potion)<br />
<br />
or you can stay as an elixir master and craft elixirs when you have mats.<br />
<br />
OR if you are lazy like me and have an at least 1 transmute recipe (like earth to water) go respec to transmute master and stay as a transmute master until you have a lot of mats for elixir mastery or potion mastery.<br />
<br />

<br />
or you can just &quot;be potion mastery after having some flasks go and stay elixir mastery&quot;</div></div><hr />

No matter what, spec potions first.  The quest is, hands down, the easiest and the cheapest to complete, and those Super Mana Potions are a great way to get to 370 (when it goes gray).<br />

From there, it doesn't matter.  I stayed potions and just made potions ad nauseum trying to make discoveries (only three so far ... :(), but I think I'm going to respec to elixirs soon (and my plan is to stay elixirs long-term).</div></div><hr />
