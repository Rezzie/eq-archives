I was just wondering what servers you guys play on. The server I currently play on has ridiculous queues every Sunday and I am looking to possibly find a server to play on Sundays that doesn't always have a queue all day long. So will you all please do me a favor and answer a few questions?<br />
<br />
-What is the server name?<br />
-What type of server is it?<br />
-What, in your opinion, are the pros and cons to your server?<br />
-Horde or Alliance?<br />

Thanks a bunch!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get a Nostromo Speedpad, setup a macro on the keypad to move you around every few mins and never...ever...log out until they bring the servers down. This way you don't get the inactivity-afk-logged out &quot;feature&quot; of WoW =)</div></div><hr />

I am just looking for another server that I can play on (atleast on Sundays if not more).  I just want to know about the servers I don't play on, so I can see if it would be nice to play on when I don't want to sit in the queue.  Plus sometimes there are people on this server that drive me crazy and make me want to log out of the server, but I still want to play WoW.<br />
<br />
I'm just wanting to find a fairly decent server that I would enjoy....and kinda know someone on there (even if it is just from a few posts on the forums).</div></div><hr />

-What type of server is it? PVP<br />
<br />
-What, in your opinion, are the pros and cons to your server?<br />
<br />
Pros:  No queue times whatsoever.  I log in about everyday and don't have to worry about being 600th in the queue.  I get right in most of the time.  It has a pretty even mix of horde and alliance and alot of 60s.<br />
<br />
Cons: It is a low population server.  Some of the economics are not the same as that of a more full server (i.e. 'expensive' items might not go for as much).  Sometimes it is tough to find good armor in the AH before level 20 as many on the server are level 60.  In the past 2 weeks the server has had to be restarted about 3 times (took about 15 minutes for the restart).  It was not just this server.  It happened with a combination with about 10 other servers.<br />
<br />
-Horde or Alliance? Horde - and we win BG's generally speaking</div></div><hr />

Yea I'm thinking I want to find a PvP server to play on some....but I want some friendly people to talk to so I'm not totally alone on there.  That's why I was asking this question.  I have toons on 2 Normal servers now....and I'm ready to get into the PvP server.  I originally started my first toon ever (on my bf's account) on a PvP server....and now that I understand my toons better and have done some PvP I feel more comfortable trying it out.  This is my first computer game I've played really.  My bf put WC3 on my laptop after I started playing WoW.<br />
<br />
I prefer Horde, but for those few lucky Alliance that are so cool I might consider playing an Alliance to have some &quot;friends&quot; around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(Yes still more pros)<br />
-Lots of great guilds to choose from.<br />
-Not a heavily populated server (so no que to get on, IIRC, we're a low-med. pop. server)<br />

Cons<br />
<br />
-Ratio of Alliance to Horde    1.3:1;Alliance:Horde (fairly equal)<br />
-Beware of BRD mountain ... Horde like to camp it while they wait for all their plaers to do BWL/MC<br />
-Beware of Northern STV, horde camp Nessingwary's.  Horde like to camp their when some alliance has killed their lowbie, but always ... theres a bigger fish(or lots of big fish, and more big fish to kill the others)  Alliance will bring their 60s in time too. Then it's a mini war.   This happens at least once a day.<br />
-We also have some people on both sides that have very low mental &amp; emotional capacities that act like they're 8 years old again.<br />

<br />

<br />
-What, in your opinion, are the pros and cons to your server?<br />
<br />
Pro: I have never had to wait in a queue to log on. Its a new (2 month old) low population server which means that there are few twinks in WSG and other battle grounds which made for (and for the most part still does equate to) equal footing in the BGs. I've found the people in WSG (Alliance) especially to be very cooperative and want to work together. Its rare that we loose to the Horde because of the cooperation. Another pro was that when this server first came out it was not flagged as NEW so the population has stayed low which is something that I personally enjoy. Sure there are immature individuals, but thats why you have the Ignore option. All in all, I'm finding this to be the best server that I have been on and I plan on staying there. (previous servers: Alleria &amp; Gorgonnash)<br />
<br />
Con: The war effort has yet to start on this server. Also with a low population the AH isn't as diverse as some people may like it to be, but it really makes you appreciate what you have even more. I think that the biggest con though is that with a low population there can be times when you have to wait 10 / 15 min for a battle ground. Personally though I use those times to either get friends together to do a raid group for WSG or go and quest in STV before more people log on.<br />
<br />
-Horde or Alliance?<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly there are slightly more Horde then Alliance on this server.<br />

<br />
If so ... the guild I'm in is looking for more priests and druids. (We run end-game stuff with the amount we have now, but we'd just like more to be safe rather than sorry)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">01-25-2006, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would possibly be doing that, but I would like to toss in a lil WSG on the way to 60.  If I did work on getting the toon to 60 I would like to end-game stuff...but leveling all over again when I have yet to have a 60 is annoying.  I probably would work more on my druid right now during the week, but play the new toon on weekends.<br />
<br />
My bf plays with me most the time....so I could possibly convince him to create a toon with me if we could get help with the first few levels fast (he hates the first 10 levels so much).  He usually plays rogues....and is very good at it.  I talked to him earlier this morning and he apparently took out a 45 warrior and 42 hunter back-to-back at level 36.<br />
<br />
If I get my current druid to 60 I might do some end-game stuff with her too.....but I dont know.  I'm having so much fun in WSG with her and the groups of friends I've made in WSG that I doubt I can change her to resto build.</div></div><hr />

I like to help others....and sometimes get help.  The reason I haven't gotten my 52 NE Priest to 60 is because before I &quot;quit&quot; playing on that server I helped lower level guildies with quests....either through an alt or my level 52.  I believe that's what guilds are all about...helping each other out (because by helping others you are helping the entire guild).  <br />
<br />
If you know of some great guilds on your servers, can you please let me know.  Even if I don't start out in a guild I would like to eventually become part of one.  It kinda sucks to rely on PuG's all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyte</div><div class="date">01-26-2006, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've moved around so much, I know a lot of different servers pretty well. My suggestion is also:<br />
<br />
Gorefiend (US PvP)<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
-I've never had a log in queue. Ever.<br />
-Always seem to be lots of PvP. Instanced and Open World both.<br />
-Generally mature people on both sides. Ganking far outside level range has been kept small, still happens, some people enjoy squashing flies I guess.<br />
-Seems to be an even population as far as playing times go. Even though its med/low pop server there are usually a few people around any area at any time.<br />
-Some really great guilds out there, who don't mind helping lowbies like me with stuff others might feel is &quot;beneath&quot; them.<br />
-Did I mention no log in queues?<br />
<br />
Cons<br />
-Not currently accepting new character creations unless you already have one. From reading the in game info though, I think that only occurs during peak times, and not all the time. Just log on in the middle of the night sometime and make your druid and then play later.<br />
-Everyone has a 60 alt, so sometimes you'll kill someone your level and have a higher level come challange you, expecting you to log off and back on with your 60 as well.<br />
<br />
Horde or Alliance<br />
-I'm Alliance. The big drawback to alliance on most servers is the relative immaturity of its players, but Gorefiend seems to all be pretty mature so its not a drawback. Horde's big drawback for me is their areas are just so ugly. Why would I want to fight in the plains or a desert when I could hang in the forest.<br />

I am a Dwarf Priest named Angeliclight (level 10 right now)....and my friend is a Human Rogue named Phantomista (also level 10).  If any of you are on Spirestone and wanna say hey or can help us out sometime just send us a tell or drop me a note on here.<br />

P.S.  Jeffj...sorry I really wanted to join up with you and Nyte on Gorefiend.  If at some point they do allow character creation soon then let me know....before I get too high in level.

As another and much more rare class, druids used to get them all the time. Not as much anymore as druids are a bit more popular, but I used to get as many phantom guild invites as phantom group invites. I would log in, head into town to sell stuff, and have to close guild invite windows. Not even a /t wanna sign my charter? Just a window opening. Crazy crazy stuff. Doesn't happen much on Gorefiend. Always a laugh though when it happens elsewhere.<br />
