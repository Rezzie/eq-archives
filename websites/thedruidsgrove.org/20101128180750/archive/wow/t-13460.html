<br />
She is now specifcially doing the Tournament daily's to get rep and the titles with each of the home cities as she says that some Crusader title is needed to get into the 5 man ?<br />
<br />
I also doubt its correct as some people wont do these q's and thus would be excluded ?<br />
<br />
2 guildies actually said they dont and wont do the dailys up at the Tourny as they <br />
<br />
a) dont like doing dailys anywhere and <br />
b)they view the tourny ones as pvp which they dont like and will not be forced to do.<br />
<br />
But if you do need Sunreaver rep then thats the only it comes from isnt it ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">07-30-2009, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've maxed out all my faction capitol reps and Argent Crusade doing tournament dailies.  Once you have the hang of jousting, they're pretty quick cash and rep.<br />
<br />
They're considered PVP because you can challenge other players and joust them.  I've never done it that way, so I don't know what you'd gain from doing that, other than the practice.<br />
<br />
I'd have to go back and look but off the top of my head I think I remember reading that there were some items that required exalted rep with Argent Crusade/Sunreaver, like the new BoA chest that gives an additional 10% to exp gain (the reason I did the quests).  I think I read something that one of the new dungeons also required some rep, but I think it was one of the raids, or perhaps hard mode.<br />
<br />
Wow.com's 3.2 coverage should make mention of it somewhere, if one has the time to look it up.<br />
<br />
Oh and a heads-up:  As it stands now (pre-3.2) you can be champion for one faction and doing those dailies, and valiant for another faction, doing those dailies... which require killing the exact same mobs.  Yup.  Each kill is credited towards both quests.  But they're supposed to 'fix' that in 3.2 so you can't double up that way, which makes now a really good time to grind it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I guess I do it the hard way...it's going to take months to get the Crusader title now.  I need to stop being a bad egg about doing my dailies lol<br />
<br />
Let's pretend for a second that faction/rep/crusader things are not necessary for this 5-man (or raid for that matter)...I assume same heroic gear requirements for the 5-man...but is this now beyond Ulduar as far as gear requirements for the raid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
it was a lot lot quicker a grind than i expected.<br />
<br />
i just want to be able to hit the new 5 man tonite !!<br />
<br />
plus ofc the daily for Triumph badges, although i'm not so bothered about those really as it will take me such a long time to save up enough for items.<br />
<br />
I would have thought the new 10 and 25 man are the next step past Uldaur.........Icecrown after that in another big content patch sometime in early 2010 ? Where does the 5 man fit in i wonder ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-05-2009, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new 5 man, on heroic...is NOT Des-Bear friendly.  We got through the first jousting portion on the mounts, and wiped repeatedly on phase two where you fight the 3 bosses melee style.<br />
<br />
The hunter who had claimed that he had run it just earlier on his druid...really kind of irked me.  First, he told us he knew all the strat, which is why he got invited to begin with.<br />
<br />
So we went in and he explains the first phase.  We do it.  Of course it glitched and we couldn't move on to the next phase.  We had to leave and reset the whole thing a few times.<br />
<br />
Then our tank left. -_-  So, my most cherished priest said he'd heal.  I switched to tanking.<br />
<br />
I again asked the hunter how hard these guys hit- (completely forgetting about the agility changes...my dodge was almost non-existent last night)- and he says &quot;Oh they don't hit hard, you should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
I whispered him and asked him to check my gear.  He says we should be fine again.  We get the bosses down into the melee phase and wiped a bunch of times.  THEN he decides to start off on a rant in whisper about how DARE I call myself a tank with such lousy gear, etc etc.  oi....it was unpleasant at best.  <br />
<br />
So, I'll go in as a healer, since my healing gear far surpasses my tanking gear.  I searched far and wide for info on the fight and found only sketchy details.  Can anyone shed some light on this new instance?<br />
<br />
Should we not have run it on heroic?  Is this one of the new &quot;Regular/Hard Mode&quot; instances?  I'm a confused tree bear thing @_@</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-06-2009, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">omg u mean its not all jousting ?<br />
<br />
we got a normal 5 man grp together last night from guild and friends as we normally do.<br />
<br />
we ran the daily and got out 2 shiny new EoT's. we ran Drak and added a few more EoC to our currency tab.<br />
<br />
then i said lets do the new one on heroic as a guildie had done it earlier and linked some very nice ilvl 219 gear they had got from it....much higher level of loot reward than the other heroics.<br />
<br />
as soon as we got it in looked like a pvp arena and we had to mount up...cue a couple people saying hmmm not sure i want to do this esp our DK tank who does not like pvp (although he's done more than me who is the Number 1 pvp hater in wow) and who has not done any of the tourny dailys.  unfortunately our 'healer' also is not a pvp fan and had also not done tourny q's.<br />
<br />
So we get the initial mobs down and along come 3 big bosses - with some co-ordination i think we would have been ok - we were not concentrating on 1 of them at a time and all 3 were alive and killing us off.<br />
<br />
So after wiping on them 2 of the grp wanted to leave so we went to Gun instead.<br />
<br />
So what's the score with the new one ? bosses in melee phase ?  i'd like to go there again tonite if i can. So you do need a proper group with a tank and healer ?  to us it looked like the group makeup was irrelevant as we were mounted ! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">08-06-2009, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">phase 2 is the. hardest. phase. of the instance. true story. depending who spawns determines your kill order. Since I'm horde, we get to kill alli (which makes me happy)... Lana what's-her-nose (the dwarf) should usually be the first one to die, because she drops a NASTY AoE poison, unless the shammy is there, obviously because he heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-07-2009, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah well...the bosses we got when my group went in was an impossibility for us.  Poisons, Whirlwinds, some sort of ability like Death Grip...ugh...If I never saw another WW again it'd be too soon.<br />
<br />
But based on the i219's that drop, I'm going to guess that your group needs to be pretty well geared in order to do this without wiping...THIS druid is not geared well enough to tank it.  I had also forgotten about the agility/dodge nerf...so my dodge % couldn't have been much above 25%.  Not good enough.  I got nuked almost instantly every time.  Very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Have they stated anywhere that you &quot;need&quot; to be twinked in Ulduar-ish or t9 gear for this 5 man?<br />
<br />
Tankspot has a pretty decent write-up on it.  =)<br />
<br />
Seems like the Mortal Strike from the stupid Orc was what was doing us in.  Hmm...</div></div><hr />

Mark the mobs in each group from left to right skull, x, and triangle, and kill them in that order. triangle has this bublle that lasts for like 5 seconds or so before he dies and on to the next group.<br />
phase 4 is ezmode. strictly tank and spank the Black Knight. there are 3 mini-phases to this fight. First time he dies and immediately comes back as a skeleton and summons an army of dead. that's when i pop berzerk and kitty swipe away, and mobs go down quickly enough. just make sure that whoever is tanking pops their AoE taunt to keep all the mobs in one place. if they spread out, it gets hairy really quickly. second time he dies he comes back as a shade or something, and is easy to down again. third time he dies, you get to collect the phat lewtz. ;)</div></div><hr />

I miss it.

why left to right ?<br />
<br />
well we did this last nite on normal mode and it was not a walk in a the park.<br />
<br />
i dont know if its due to people not being familiar with jousting or i fits the difference of having to co-ordinate on jousting which mob when you cant heal and you feel alone even though there are 5 of you.<br />
<br />
we did it - the loot was ofc rather average and no one actually needed any of it.<br />
<br />
based on our showing i'd not be confident of clearing it heroic with the same group and it was all good people we know/guildies.<br />
<br />
dps was not low. i would say everyone was 2k, ok maybe the pally was 1.7/8 as a newish 80. But myself and the mage are over 2k no problem.  healer was good.<br />
<br />
i found it a struggle to die and come run back in and be on such low hp with no buffs to have to get back into the fight versus the 3 bosses in phase 1. wotever.  Esp if 2 people were dead at the same time running back in.<br />
<br />
Is there are best grp makeup for heroic ?<br />
<br />
Any particular order to kill the 3 bosses in ?  Last nite the tank said kill the human first but he could not mark due to an interface screwup......and then some were confused which one was human although it seemed to be the Marshall.<br />
<br />
I like the look of the heroic loot but atm i'm not sure if/when or who to go back with tbh.<br />
<br />
normal heroics and a pile of badges seems easier.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">08-12-2009, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">left to right because you want to kill the priestess first. the middle guy is fairly inconsequential, but the Monk bubbles before he dies, so you could be spending some wasted effort while that other guy is running free.<br />
<br />
as far as the jousting goes, if everyone is focusing on the same target, that target should go down fairly quickly.<br />
<br />
as soon as you feel comfortable running it on heroic, get in there man! items that drop are Uld 10 ilvl. You would see a significant boost to your dps after getting a few drops. :)</div></div><hr />

So far it is a cake walk. Its being puged on my server every day and is being 1-3 shoted everytime if your group isnt complete fail. If your a tank you should prob have 45k life (25 man) (40k 10 man) or have good healers. I tank it with 48k life and dont have any problems. Phase 2 of northrend beasts is the only fight that takes any coordination the other fights are a joke so far. Anyways I would say pug into a 10-25 TOC and see what happens. If you havent seen the fight yet go to tankspot.com and watch the video they explain everything.</div></div><hr />

Danimal, what is your dodge% looking like?  Mine dropped significantly after the patch.  Very frustrating.  I put +26Agi on my staff to get it to 29%...It looks like I'm going to need to start picking the minds of my feral friends again if I plan to tank again in the future.</div></div><hr />

I haven't really been playing my druid much except for the occasional 5-man or odd raid here or there, so my gear is still basic entry-level gear for both my healing and tanking set.  Eventually I'll get it all upgraded...=)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-17-2009, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khel, it's tough.  I am not geared enough to tank it, so I get dragged in there to heal.  There is a lot of party-wide damage in there, especially Phase 3 of the Black Knight Fight, but all in all it's not that bad.  <br />
<br />
I think it's just hard because there's a bunch of phases.  There's the jousting phase, followed by the three boss phase.<br />
<br />
After that you get either the Paladin guy or the Priest.  The priest is actually a 3 phase fight- whoop on her, then whoop on the nightmare she spawns (We got Van Cleef and he wiped us because our tank DC'd, then we got Eck when we went back in), then back to whooping on her.<br />
<br />
Then you get the Black Knight.<br />
<br />
Our group does it like this:<br />
Phase 1:  Kill his minion, then kill him.<br />
Phase 2:  Skeleton phase- Kill his Army of the dead, avoid his desecrates, kill him.<br />
Phase 3:  Ghost phase:  Nuke the heck out of him quickly because this entire phase consists of big party-wide damage.  We tend to save ALL of our CD's for this phase.  <br />
<br />
The 3 boss phase is kind of hard, but yesterday when we did it, we got through the jousting, took the bosses off their mounts, then ran out to reset.  When we went back in they were just standing there, patiently waiting for us to destroy them =)  So we did!  Just have to remember to re-equip your actual weapons instead of the lance you use during the first phase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">08-17-2009, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a special note on Phase two adds before Pally or Priest boss.  Most groups make the mistake of clearing left to right, killing:<br />
<br />
Priest, Pally, Monk.<br />
<br />
If you are going to run it on normal, this is ok, but not optimal.  <br />
<br />
Most people kill the monk last, because he is seemingly harmless.  He infact makes your tank crittable.  This is why your Ulduar geared tanks are getting rocked in a T7 situation.  <br />
<br />
On heroic mode you will almost certainly wipe a few times if you don't focus down the Monk.  He sucks to kill because of his &quot;Meditation&quot; thing, but you will save your healers a lot of stress if you nuke them first.  The priest can heal, but does it sparingly (and you can kill her lightwell).  Her heals are laughable at best.  I reccomend killing Monk, Priest then Pally.<br />
<br />
Also, on the final phase of the Black Knight, have the troops collapse in together.  The AOE damage is arena wide, so they can't avoid it anyhow.  If you stack up, heals like CoH or WG will make the DPS race abit more stacked in your favor.  If you have a pally healer...give them a big Hug, because they are performing some kind of miracle to get you that far!  :)</div></div><hr />

So you all run out on purpose as soon as all 3 off their mounts ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I still need to try this on heroic. i either dont have time or by the time i am able to get online eveyones done it during the day, the no lifers!!<br />
<br />
<br />
So its not good for a pally healer then in here Solar ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The final phase consists of the raid taking ~2k damage per tick, and the &quot;focused&quot; target taking around 4k-5k per tick.  So from the time phase 3 starts, its literally a DPS race to kill him before he kills you.  If you don't have massive AoE heals you are in big trouble.  <br />
<br />
Druid Healers can Rejuv everyone in the raid, WG everytime its off CD and then nourish or swiftmend the focused person.  <br />
<br />
Holy Priests can bounce PoM, use COH whever possible and mix in flash heals and PoH.<br />
<br />
Pally healers can flash heal like made, but they will struggle with keeping everyone up.  The biggest advantage they have is the ability to bubble themselves, beacon the tank and then just spam the party. <br />
<br />
The event as a whole entails a lot of splash damage and &quot;Chaos control&quot;.  HoTs are very useful for multiple phases of the encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-21-2009, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would imagine this is kind of tough for a paladin healer.  There's The Glyph of Holy Light (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41106) that allows their holy light to grant 10% of it's total heal to other party members.  So, I would guess if you throw holy light on the target that's &quot;focused&quot; and taking the most damage...depending on how big it is, it might be doable.  <br />
<br />
Otherwise I can see a pally healer spamming heals like a madman/woman.  <br />
<br />
I'm guilty of spamming nourish on everyone for that final phase.  I nearly exploded with joy when I found out that there is an idol that grants spellpower SPECIFICALLY to Nourish.  Nourishspammers rejoice!  Blizz &lt;3's us!</div></div><hr />

I typically get a Rejuv on every party memeber then WG, then pop barksin/tranqility.  If he's not dead by the time that is done channeling, I hit WG again.  Never had him last anylonger than that.</div></div><hr />
