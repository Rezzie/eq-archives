<br />
<br />
On a side note from my other topic ( new here patience please)  <br />
Swipe and mangle works really good in stockades after u  pull a whole wing of guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vika</div><div class="date">04-19-2008, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a Pounce / Mangle macro.<br />
<br />
/cast [stealth] Pounce; Mangle (Cat)()<br />
<br />
I also have this on key 0 which is bound to my left mouse thumb button. In Bear form 0 is Lacerate. In druid form it's MotW.<br />
<br />
I have a Ravage / Shred Macro.<br />
<br />
/cast [stealth] Ravage; Shred<br />
<br />
This is bound to -, my other left mouse thumb button. It's also Mangle in Bear form and OOC in Druid.<br />
<br />
Then I have this crazy macro:<br />
<br />
/cast [modifier:ctrl, target=mouseover,harm] Entangling Roots; [modifier:shift] Entangling Roots; [harm] Moonfire; [help] [target=player] Lifebloom<br />
<br />
This is bound to a small mouse button just below my scroll wheel. If I hold Ctrl down and the target I'm moused over is an enemy, I cast entangling roots. If I hold shift down it casts Entangling Roots on my target. If I have an enemy  targeted this casts Moonfire. And if I have a player targeted it casts lifebloom.<br />
<br />
This is very useful since it is a way to break form also. Typically if I break form it's to heal, CC, or quickly Moonfire. So then I have my Cyclone Macro.<br />
<br />
/cast [target=mouseover,harm] Cyclone; Cyclone<br />
<br />
This casts cyclone on mouseover if it's an enemy, otherwise it casts cyclone on my Target. It's bound to a button under my middle mouse button as well.<br />
<br />
And then there's my Focus CC macro.<br />
<br />
/cast [modifier:shift,target=focus] Entangling Roots;[target=focus] Cyclone<br />
<br />
This casts Entangling Roots on my Focus if I hold Shift down. Otherwise it Cyclone's my focus. I have this bound to a small button just above my mouse wheel.<br />
<br />
So bascially with my right hand I can do many things. Hmm...not sure that came out right. No pun intended. :biggrin:<br />
<br />
Oh and then the 'Decurse' basically.<br />
<br />
/cast [modifier:shift] Remove Curse;Abolish Poison<br />
<br />
If I hold shift down it Removes Curse, otherwise Abolish Poison. I keep meaning to make this easier to use on Player's but haven't go around to it yet.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps. Let me know if you want more.</div></div><hr />

Oh and more is always better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiglin</div><div class="date">04-19-2008, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hibernate macro: I ported this over from my shadow priest's shackle macro. If you regular click/press the button it sets the current target as my focus and casts hibernate. Then I can right click the button to cast hibernate on that same target even if I am targeting something else. The last line of the macro starts/refreshes a quartz (mod) 30 second timer bar . Honestly I haven't used this much.<br />
<br />
#showtooltip hibernate<br />
/clearfocus [button:1, noexists]<br />
/focus [button:1, harm]<br />
/stopcasting<br />
/cast [button:2, target=focus] hibernate; hibernate<br />
/qt 30 Hibernate<br />
 <br />
Unlike Vika I have linked pounce with shred.<br />
 <br />
#showtooltip<br />
/cast [stealth] pounce; shred<br />
 <br />
I wanted a macro that when pressed put me in cat, when in cat and pressed put me in stealth, and when right clicked took me out of cat. When in stealth and pressed it will put me in cat unstealth mode.<br />
 <br />
#showtooltip<br />
/cast [stance:3, nostealth] prowl; !cat form<br />
/cancelform [button:2][modifier:ctrl]<br />
 <br />
I wanted a macro for both feral mangles and would use my trinkets while in cat form. I will probably end up unlinking these so I can disable the sound while pressing the button so I don't have to hear the trinket isn't available for use sound. I probably don't have characters left.<br />
 <br />
#showtooltip [stance:1] Mangle (bear)(); [stance:3] mangle (cat)()<br />
/use [stance:3] 13<br />
/use [stance:3] 14<br />
/startattack<br />
/cast [stance:3] Mangle (Cat)()<br />
/cast [stance:1] Mangle (Bear)()<br />
 <br />
The rest are fairly generic: one button for either abolish poison or remove curse, one for cheetah to run or seal if I am swiming, one that casts single or group MotW, etc. Am all about freeing buttons up. The problem is I tend to run low on macro slots =/<br />
 <br />
Edit: Lines to disable/enable sound are:<br />
/console Sound_EnableSFX 0<br />
/console Sound_EnableSFX 1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annikk</div><div class="date">04-24-2008, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a selection of my favourite macros.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.<br />
Here is a really cool macro that will turn grassy areas into really really really grassy areas.  It also makes clouds more fluffy.  :&gt;  This macro may have an adverse effect on your frames per second.  Once activated, you can disable it by going to Options, Video Options, then clicking OK without making any changes.<br />
<br />
/console groundEffectDensity 256<br />
/console groundEffectDist 140<br />
/console detailDoodadAlpha 100<br />
/console horizonfarclip 2112<br />
/console farclip 777<br />
/console characterAmbient 0<br />
/console smallcull 0<br />
/console skycloudlod 3<br />
<br />
Put that code into a macro and put the button for the macro somewhere out of the way on your UI.  You only need to press it once.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.<br />
This macro will use your Mangle (Cat) ability, and if you don't have sufficient energy to Mangle, it will just start your normal attacks.  This is useful so that you don't stand there like a lemon waiting for energy.<br />
<br />
/startattack<br />
/cast Mangle (Cat)(Rank 3)<br />
<br />
<br />
3.<br />
This macro I have assigned to my side mouse button.<br />
If I'm in caster form, it casts Moonfire on my target.<br />
If I'm in bear form, it casts Mangle(Bear) on my target, or if I don't have enough rage or mangle is on cooldown, it just starts normal white attacks.<br />
If I'm in cat form, it activates Tiger's Fury.<br />
<br />
/cast [nostance] Moonfire(Rank 12)<br />
/startattack [stance:1]<br />
/cast [stance:1] Mangle (Bear)(Rank 3)<br />
/cast [stance:3] Tiger's Fury<br />
<br />
<br />
4.<br />
I use this macro for cat form.  If my target is an enemy, it casts Cower.  If my target is a friend, it casts Regrowth.<br />
Casting regrowth straight from cat form is faster than shifting out and then casting.  This is because you need to wait the duration of your own latency before you actually exit cat form and get your caster-form bars up.<br />
<br />
#ShowToolTip Cower(Rank 5)<br />
/cast [harm,exists] Cower(Rank 5)<br />
/cancelform [help,exists]<br />
/cast [help,exists] Regrowth(Rank 10)<br />
<br />
<br />
5.<br />
This macro casts Rebirth on my target, and reports the action to my guild's Druid channel, which is channel number 4 for me.  Change the channel number depending on where you want it reported.<br />
<br />
#showtooltip<br />
/cast Rebirth(Rank 6)<br />
/4 *** Battle Res On %t ***<br />
<br />
<br />
6.<br />
This macro I have assigned to my middle mouse button.<br />
If I'm in bear form, it casts Feral Charge on my target.<br />
If I'm in cat form, it casts Maim on my target.<br />
If I'm in caster form, it casts Entangling Roots on my target.<br />
<br />
/cast [stance:1] Feral Charge<br />
/cast [stance:3] Maim(Rank 1)<br />
/cast [nostance] Entangling Roots(Rank 7)<br />
<br />
<br />
7.<br />
This macro is a real essential for me.<br />
I have it assigned to the Tilde key, which is the key above Tab and to the left of 1.<br />
<br />
If I'm in cat form and not prowling, it casts Prowl.  It's completely spammable - too many presses won't take me straight out of prowl again.  I always found that to be a problem before, but this macro solves it.<br />
If I'm in caster form, it casts Shadowmeld, and again is completely spammable.<br />
<br />
If I want to forcefully destealth without actually using any abilities, holding down the CTRL key while using this macro forces me out of stealth.<br />
<br />
/cast [stance:3,nostealth,nocombat] !Prowl(Rank 3)<br />
/cast [nostance,nocombat,nostealth] Shadowmeld(Racial)<br />
/cast [modifier:ctrl] Prowl(Rank 3)<br />
<br />
<br />
8.<br />
This macro allows you to fly upside down!<br />
<br />
/console pitchlimit 5000<br />
<br />
You can use the following macro to set it back to normal:<br />
<br />
/console pitchlimit 100<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Catslyer</div><div class="date">04-30-2008, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well just a slight change on my Pounce and Ravange macros.  As most often you want to make sure your stealthed prior to using those abilities I added a stealth option to them.  That way I go back to steatlth soon as I drop combat if I am spamming my attacks.  Or better yet if I am approuching my target and not stealthed I will go stealth before I mistakenly attack and miss my opener like a bit dork LOL <br />
<br />
#showtooltip [stealth]pounce;shred<br />
/cast [nostealth,nocombat]Prowl;[stealth]pounce;shred<br />
<br />
#showtooltip [stealth]Ravage;Mangle<br />
/cast [nostealth,nocombat]Prowl;[stealth]Ravage;Mangle<br />
<br />
To upgrade them a bit further you could add the use trinket options for when in stealth.  That way the macro should pop your trinkets just before you open with your stealth attacks.  Most trinkets will not break stealth prior to use but you would have to test first hand just to be on the safe end.  Also they would need to be placed before the attack so you get thier buff like so.<br />
<br />
#showtooltip [stealth]pounce;shred<br />
/use [stance:3,stealth] 13<br />
/use [stance:3,stealth] 14<br />
/cast [nostealth,nocombat]Prowl;[stealth]pounce;shred</div></div><hr />
