If you are shrouded can they drop?  Can they drop if you are using an Alt in Misty Thicket but that cons blue to the level 2 mini-druid you are starting afresh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">09-17-2007, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">range was expanded to light blue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quaras</div><div class="date">09-17-2007, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok -- that helps, but does not answer whether folks are going to be able to powerlevel their alts and then get access to these items.  Does shrouding work?  Does the level of the player marking the kill work - or do these mainly drop off lt blue to 75 mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">09-17-2007, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The overall drop rate seems to be so low that it's unlikely to be worthwhile even in a powerlevelling scenario.<br />
<br />
I got one after 5 kills.  To my knowledge, no one in the rest of my guild (of 100+ active members) has seen one drop.<br />
<br />
It may take some time to get confirmed reports of packs dropping for lower level characters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lookitma</div><div class="date">10-14-2007, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In an eight hour grind session yesterday I got 1 LoN drop, a Starter Deck. I'm not a LoN player and I'm not hurting for plat, so I gave it away to a guildy. <br />
 <br />
Now, I was dropping one mob ever 90 seconds. Thats about 320 Mobs give or take (8hours=28,200 seconds/90 seconds per mob). All dark blue. However, I had a guildy who zoned into steepes, killed a light blue and got a booster pack in about 30 seconds...so...totally random. Other than the two of us no one in my guild has seen one drop.<br />
 <br />
Also, Wildeagle: I would answer your question if I could understand more than two words in a row in your post. As it is I only see a random scattering of letters devoid of punctuation and in desperate need of a spell check.</div></div><hr />
