<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">04-29-2008, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've mentioend a few times that i've done all the epic flying form quest chain apart from ofc the run to heroic sethhek.<br />
<br />
not being in a big guild - try a minute one :whistle:  and having limited wow time due to RL i'm more limited to going to 5 mans and esp heroics which i've only started doing with a guildie recently.<br />
<br />
however i've got to know some good people in other larger guilds who will often join us in a 5 man so we dont have to do full pugs with myself and a guildy priest + 3 others.<br />
<br />
last week we did heroic ramparts with a mage i knew vaguely who'd taken 3 months off wow.  he had all the epics as had been a big raider. we had a massively fun run with me tanking, guildly holy priest, this back to Wow epic fire mage, a frost mage friend of his and a hunter we know well.<br />
<br />
so there i am on sunday - just back from the beach with the family and decided to login quickly - baby was still asleep from the drive home :).<br />
<br />
The fire mage is online and i get chatting - where is he ? he's just joined a new raiding guild and they've just completed a guild run of Daily Heroic Sethhek...brains starts to whirr at this point...as did his and we both mention a plan sometime to get a summons to a grp that just finished heroic Sethhek.<br />
<br />
Next i'm being invited to join the grp to summon and kill Anzu !!:grin: <br />
<br />
Of course a lot of people want the mount Anzu can drop so 3 of the grp are more than happy to stay and help me and they find another guildiy also keen to help out for a hot at the mount - i gather they run sethhek heroic quite often with a druid to try for the mount. they actually had it drop a couple of days before where the warrior in this grp lost the roll.<br />
<br />
So there is little me - not having a clue wots going to happen with Anzu just knowing that i'm supposed to keep up HOT's on the 'statues' - wotever they look like and wherever they are / appear ?<br />
<br />
But i dutifully put on my healing gear for mana for HOTing - run over and insert the moonstone into the claw and wait with anticipation.....suddenly the warrior says he's nearly here, after he arrvies Khel you go and stand by the claw and do your thing...<br />
<br />
so off i run and then i 'see' the statues and get merryily HOTting away.....then its bird AOE time and i get some aggro but never seem to lose many HP or Mana despite all the HOT's i am trying to keep up.<br />
<br />
only once do we seem in trouble towards the end of the fight when the warrior suddenly dips to 2k HP and less so i throw him a heal - i'd been told before just to do the statues and nothing else...a shammy was healing.<br />
<br />
so before i know it - Mr Anzu is dead and up its flashes on my screen Anzu 1/1.<br />
<br />
i literally did a dance around the room ! 10 mins 'work' and suddenly i've got EPIC FLYING FORM !  something i thought would not be coming my way for a while cos people saying heroic sethhek needs a god grp and its not an easy heroic.<br />
<br />
so after thanking them all very very much off i go to hand in and start flying around manically on my newest epic flying mount......it was worth the wait and the quest chain to get it.<br />
<br />
ok enough of my waffle and if you read this far.....you have bear like stamina :rolling: <br />
<br />
<br />
PS - also got exalted with Shattered Sun on saturday so was a good wow weekend despite the fact i spent little time in wow !</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">05-12-2008, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">very cool man! gratz on the swift flight form...<br />
<br />
as soon as i had the G for epic flight skill, i quickly bought it, and ended up having less than 10G to my name...<br />
<br />
There was a VERY helpful post here and link to the flightform chain walkthrough video (of which i had taken very detailed notes weeks before starting the chain), and i completed the entire chain, with the exception of heroic Sethhek in one night... it took another 2 weeks to get the RIGHT group to run the instance with me.<br />
<br />
After having a dismal couple hours trying to down the first boss with a less than stellar shammy healer, a shadow priest in my guild sends me a tell and asks me how it was going... i told him not so well, and that my group was disbanding. About 3 minutes after that, he got an experienced group of guildies up and running, and we ROLLED through it... he even got boomkin druid that knew the Anzu fight like the back of his hand to come help out... I remember going to work the next day with MASSIVE sleep deprivation, but it was SO worth it... I love being able to haul ass through the outlands lol...</div></div><hr />
