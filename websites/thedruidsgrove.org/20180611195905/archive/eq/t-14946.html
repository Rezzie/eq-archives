<br />
I can not reach a connection to everquest for 1 week now. Here are the details:<br />
<br />
I can start the patcher and download files without any problems.<br />
When I reach the login window and try to log in, I get the following message:<br />
<br />
&quot;A connection to the server could not be reached. Please check your internet connection to make sure you are online.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I am online and can visit any page I visit, including Sony&#180;s Everquest page. Searching on the EQ help page did not help.<br />
<br />
I changed from 0,7MB DSL to 6MB DSL recently, but EQ worked with the new connection.<br />
<br />
I pinged Everquest.com and it works fine. I disabled the firewall and put Everquest into the exemption table there, too.<br />
<br />
I have no new hardware, no router, run Windows XP. All Internet connections work fine.<br />
<br />
I run out of ideas what to do. Does anyone have any ideas? I miss EQ. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks a ton.<br />

<br />
Router firewall.<br />
Zonealarm or any other downloaded firewall or security product.<br />
Windows Firewall (if using xp sp2).<br />
<br />
Now try. If you get a connection, re-enable them one by one and retry each time. If you find one locks you out, time to rtfm and figure out why.<br />

<br />
I once had to turn off Zonealarm and then run the patcher. After everything was patched and I could get into the game I was able to turn Zonealarm back on with no ill effects.</div></div><hr />

It's fixed BTW.</div></div><hr />
