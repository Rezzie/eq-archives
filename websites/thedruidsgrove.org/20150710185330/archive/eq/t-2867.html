It's an uber spell.  Cast it on your meleers and they'll lick your face with gratitude.</div></div><hr />

I have yet to group with a melee'r who would accept wolf form.  They HATE it.<br />
<br />
I always wolf up, if outdoors, unless it makes me kos where I otherwise would not be.</div></div><hr />

Despite my dislike of the attack animations.  50 attack is worth the discomfort.  I usually also like to be levitating too so I can position myself around people/things blocking the back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I always used it in Hate way back when - way handy when you've got a ton of people sitting on top of each other - and when you duck and run, you can move around super easy, even when in a crowd.<br />
<br />
And fire imp form is WAY more annoying than wolf form. Ugh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only thing I ever use wolf form for these days is power leveling and I don't think I've ever gotten a request from a melee for it.<br />
<br />
Since the change to shrink to make it outdoor useable there is even less reason to need wolf form in tight areas.  I also always keep a stock of shrink potions on me to shrink down myself and my pony when I’m not grouped with my usual shaman partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CountessKrak</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never use wolf form because I prefer SoE which is far superior for us Druids, Levitation allow you to gain ground on mobs by going over hills. They follow the surface and you gain ground by goign in a straight line. Plus I have much better visibility floating in the air as mentioned earlier. My 53 Ranger gets wolfed always though. He is a Halfling liek my Druid so he is the same height in Wolf Form or in Halfling form. In fact h eis taller in Wolf Form I beilieve. LOL. The comment about melees not likeing to look at knees is somethign they need to get used to. On raids all of the big guys get shrunk down to Halfling size anyway.</div></div><hr />

But for any non-Primal groups +50atk (stacks with ranger buffs) is pretty nice</div></div><hr />

But its beta neutral. Why would you need wolf form for that?<br />
<br />
Do you mean the other vendor across from her? The one selling the thing needed for celestial thingies?</div></div><hr />

Mainly because I couldn't for the life of me tell if I was sitting or standing, something that was EXTREMLY important while playing a druid (before I got my horse, when wolfform wouldn't take hold anymore).</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's also using a 2-hander, so the increased attack helps raise his minimum hits (hitting for minimum is worse with a slow weap than a fast one). Most people I know with fast weapons hate wolf.<br />
<br />
The constant barking is TRES annoying, and the way the mob seems to move away and back needs to go.</div></div><hr />

Finally I picked it up for him (what do I need it for? when wolf form would have helped me I was always in dungeons, then I got MoS and have been in outdoor zones...wolf form you say? what's that?).<br />
<br />
When I got around to asking why...I became a wee bit jealous.  With the AA skill permanent illusion one cast from me will keep him with perma-sow for 6-12 hours.  But hey, he keeps me in tranq, it's worth it, right?  And tgbable is the way to go, I don't have to leave a group to make him happy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main's a druid, of course, so i always wondered why the hell no one wanted it, when it added to att, was a sow, and just looked cool.<br />
<br />
Then I rolled my rogue alt for fun playing.  Oh lord.  Yeah the attack buff does help, no doubt.<br />
<br />
But do you know how hard it can be in a fight when there are 6 wolves in close quarters, and there are multiple mobs, no chanter, and you're trying to pick one mob off the cleric, and every single person looks the same?<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, assist, fol, tricks a thru z to find a mob, but 2 seconds to hesitate or to wonder who's who, and bang the clerics dead, the tanks are dead, and you are dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SIGH.<br />
<br />
OK, let's dig out this new spell I got a few weeks back.  Unclick horse, click spell, click off wolf form, reSoE myself, resummon horse.  God, I hate group wolf form.<br />
<br />
And then......<br />
<br />
time flies by, and I start wondering when I'lll need to refresh wolf form.  And time keeps going by, and by, and by....<br />
<br />
And now I love the new share wolf form spell =)  2 hours and 24 minutes, instead of 36 minutes!<br />
<br />
I may actually start using this for PLing now =)<br />

Some druids don't use howler despite the 2pt extra mana regen.<br />
<br />
Think that most druids dont use it cause it wont stack with Mask of the Hunter/Stalker/Forest whci all provies a better manaregen thatn the wolfform spell, and is usable inside also.</div></div><hr />
