<br />
It is kind of frustrating to not be able to play with people I know (they all work) because the game is almost unplayable during peak hours.  The server I was on crashed 2 times then Bliz just kind of shut it down.<br />
<br />
Maybe it wasn't the smartest idea to add a patch right after the Christmas rush.<br />
<br />
Bliz gets a 1/10 for poor planning.</div></div><hr />

You can't keep opening new servers forever, something has to be done with the servers, ie. replaced, fixed or whatever.  This constant queing and crashing has got to stop.  You would think with how much money they're making from this game, they could do things a little bit better.<br />
1)  Things promised to be in game at release are still not there. ie Hero Classes<br />
2) After 13 months of being released, they still cant get a patch right.<br />
3) Content that was supposed to be in the game at released has been released every couple of months as our new, free content that shouldve been in already<br />
4) And constantly getting the &quot;[insert bug] has been fixed in patch 1.x..... Oh wait, no it is working as intended.....Nvm, fixed the [insert bug] for real this time....&quot;  And there are bugs that are still in game from release which have not been fixed.<br />

Dont get me wrong, I love this game, Blizzard could just do a much better job IMO.  But I am not a programmer/developer or anything like that so I probably don't know what I'm talking about.  Thank you for letting me rant.</div></div><hr />

No problem - in fact I would like to hear a little more ranting from some others - I'm sure others are kind of frustrated.</div></div><hr />

This board is full of great, helpful and amusing discussions, a &quot;WTF is Blizzard doing?&quot; thread would be nice just to hear other peoples views on stuff like how the game is progressing.</div></div><hr />
