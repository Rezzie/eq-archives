Can anyone direct me to one or help here?  I'm new to druid and honestly have no clue how to duel.  My spec is Feral, lvl 22.  (Mainly so I could tank in instances.  My 'main' is a 44 priest, so while I can't live without healing, I'd rather be a backup). I just am not sure what to do.  No idea for duels how to start, and when in world, I start with cat, and then dump my points into rip (which doesn't impress me).  After that, I feel like my DPS to Damage taken ratio kinda hurts.  Should I be switching to caster and healing then back to cat or bear?  No Idea how to finish after the opener.  Or am I just in general on the wrong track?</div></div><hr />

If you get the jump on them in open world PvP, go cat form stealth -&gt; pounce -&gt; rake -&gt; shred until you get 5 combo points, then rip, switch out, root (or NG if you have it), back up MF, IS (if you have it), FF, Put both HoT's on yourself, drop into bear form -&gt; charge, demoralizing roar, maul till they are dead.  <br />
<br />
Against Mail or Plate wearers, I rarely go in cat form, as melee damage is mitigated too much to make cat really effective.  Typical strat for me there is Root, MF, IS, FF, SF, SF, MF, IS, Bear -&gt; charge -&gt; demoralizing roar, beat them down.  Remember to save your bash until you need to heal in these cases.  5 second stun is enough time to pop out, regrowth and rejuv then pop back into bear before they know what happened.<br />
<br />
For Duels I usually do the same thing, except for against Rogues, who can vanish before the duel actually starts.  Then I just put up thorns, get in bear, demo roar when I think they are close (some say this unstealths rogues, though I am not sure), wait out their initial barrage of stunlocks etc. till they have blown their cooldowns then beat them down.<br />
<br />
These are just some of the many different strategies you can use.  And when you get to lv 30, oh boy.  You can get Green Whelp Armor (5% chance when hit to put melee attackers to sleep)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sond</div><div class="date">04-06-2006, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ravage is generally better than Pounce. Your target will trinket out of the stun before you make up for the damage you would have done from Ravage. Then they will fear, blink, or frost nova. If they fear, use your trinket and then finish them. If they blink, switch to bear and feral charge to get back in range. If they frost nova, switch out and then back to cat or bear depending on how far away they are. Try to hit them with a MF in between.</div></div><hr />

They dont know what to do when I'm jumping and running circles around them at mount speed shredding their face :)<br />
<br />
I do like ravage too - nothing like seeing 1500 - 1800 crits and watching their health drop by half before they even notice you.  Good point about the trinket.  I use pounce sometimes if I want to stack up some combo points quickly without really getting hit to shred for the DoT before switching out and going to bear, though if they trinket that strat is blown.  All situational really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The other nerf is that the effect no longer effects anyone or I believe anything over level 50.  not real noticeable while you're leveling, but many 60s still were wearing it in BGs, especially flag carriers, leaving a trail of sleeping pursuers in their wake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, it got nerfed for anyone over 50.  Cause it was really overpowered.  Used to be a 30 sec sleep.  Thats insane lol.<br />
<br />
But for lv 30 - 50, the 10 seconds that it puts an enemy attacker to sleep is still awesome.  Think about getting jumped by a rogue while you are drinking or something.  Then he falls asleep.  10 sec is a long time for you to heal up, ff (which doesn't break sleep), then kick his arse.  Or running the flag in WSG.  Anything that will get someone off your back for just 1 sec, let alone 10, in cheeta form will help big time.<br />
<br />
And yeah, as Mort said, you prob cant take on 5 or so mobs anymore, but fighting 2 or 3 you will be guaranteed at least one of them to fall asleep long enough for you to kill the other, heal up then wake him up with a claw to the face :)</div></div><hr />
