Is my vote.  One simple reason....HIT.<br />
<br />
The rest of the stats just seem to come as you progress through content.  Hit is always a struggle for tanks.<br />
<br />
Almost no T7 (i200) stuff has + hit for bears.  Its not until you get to the T7.5(i213) stuff that you start seeing it incorporated back into gear that is otherwise itemized for tanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">03-05-2009, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's has been my thoughts as well.  I use the Drake-Champion's bracers in my &quot;trash&quot; set (I typically put more threat stats on my trash set to keep mobs on me right after a pull) and my Dragonfriend bracers as my boss set (more armor).  Though the Tunneler bracers have exp and for a tank hit==exp, right?<br />
<br />
Maybe I should get the Hateful ones for my boss set since they have purple armor but more agi and sta than the Dragonfriend....choices, choices...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed Solar - i have really struggled for +hit - even more so as i dont raid, so a nice looking set of BoE bracers with 29 hit were simply to good to ignore.<br />
<br />
Excuse my ignorance but i am assuming T7.5 is from Naax 25?<br />
<br />
Are all these bracers you linked i200 tlb ?<br />
<br />
The Dragon ones are from exalted with someone - wyrm ?  cos i seem to remember them as something i'm aiming for ! although now seeing them all listed i'm wondering if i'll need them over the Drakes ! possibly i'd use them in kitty running dailys due to the crit.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bindings are nice if you've got good other stats and can use the +exp, plus a bit more stam on them.</div></div><hr />

- is your aggro to low and u are at 6.5% expertise go with the &quot;drake-champ...&quot;<br />
- if u are &lt; 6.5% expertise go for the &quot;bindings of tunneler&quot; <br />
why? more expertise = more aggro(cause less dodge)/more damage-mitigation (cause less parries)/more stam</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience &quot;Miss&quot; is a much bigger problem than &quot;Dodge&quot; or &quot;Parry&quot; when I am looking at the text whirling while raiding.  I have always taken the stance Hit &gt; Exp.  Lots and Lots of bear/kitty gear is over itemized with exp, so I lump that stat in with stam, str....and all those that you really don't need to worry about.  They sort of just happen on their own.  <br />
<br />
+Hit will not happen on its own.  You will have to actively pursue it.  <br />
<br />
And, yes.  T7.5 is from all 25man raids (lvl 80).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there +hit food and/or flash/potions/elixirs?<br />
<br />
And, yes, those are all ilvl 200 items.  The two with higher armor are purple (epic), the other two are blue (rare).<br />
<br />
Also, it looks like wowhead is messed up regarding stone keeper's shards (stupid worthless things).  I don't see how i can use those to buy honor, like wowhead makes it look.</div></div><hr />

You can definitely use them to buy Wintergrasp Commendation (http://thottbot.com/i44115) , whether for yourself or for any of your other toons on the same server. Once you buy it, you can either mail it to another toon, or right click on it (i would imagine) and receive the honor. Honor farming is SO stoopid easy doing the daily BG along with the Wintergrasp PvP dailies, that i can't really imagine needing to use it for yourself though.</div></div><hr />

Not anymore, They changed the commendations to be purchased with WG mark and NOT shards in the last minipatch.</div></div><hr />

The stam makes up for the lack of hit and you get expertise which is a great stat for TPS.  You lose some agi but you can toss an enchant on it to make up for it.</div></div><hr />

Do the Bindings drop from a proper raid - 10 or 25 man ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s3Rgio</div><div class="date">03-11-2009, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">EXP is far more important for a tank than +HIT.<br />
Why?<br />
- the boss cant dodge anymore when u have EXP at 6.5% (so it is a similar effect as HIT -&gt; more aggro)<br />
- the bosses chance to parry is reduced (cap is at 15% for lvl83 mobs), why is that good -&gt; everytime a boss parries, his attack speed for the next hit is increased -&gt; more damage from boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bindings drop from Heroic Utgarde Keep from the second boss.  I used them until I got Sinner's Binding from Naxx 25 pretty much.  It was hard to find any other bracers that really made up for the stam/expertise.  <br />
<br />
And yes, please don't neglect expertise as a tank.  It's a really important skill.  Tanking is not just about mitigation/stamina.  It's also about threat which is a moot point lately for five mans but really factors in when you start doing raids.</div></div><hr />

U are at 5% expertise. Change your wrists to the tunnelers and i would save ur badges for the T7 chest. It has expertise on it and really nice stats!<br />
