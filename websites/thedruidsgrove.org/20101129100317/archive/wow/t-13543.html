I was wanting to know what the haste &quot;cap&quot; is so that I don't waste the itemization on it if I could pick up another beneficial stat.<br />
<br />
The research I've done so far in trying to find out what the &quot;cap&quot; is has all given different answers...so I thought I'd check in with you other trees and see what you thought.<br />
<br />
Also, trying to weigh my options here with the Vestaments of Spruce and Fir vs the t10 Lasherweave Robe for healing.  Vestaments has lots of haste (which I love) and is probably a &quot;bigger&quot; immediate upgrade overall...but I'd lose the 4pc bonus from the tier 10...(which, imho is meh anyway...)  Opinions?<br />
<br />
Btw, I miss you guys!</div></div><hr />

If you have GotE and Celestial Focus, 395 haste will bring the GCD of your hots down to 1 seconds.<br />
<br />
Continuing to stack haste will not affect your hots anymore, but it will continue to make your cast times and the GCD of all your other abilities (ie remove curse, abolish poison, etc, etc) shorter. So if you find yourself stacking haste past 395, you can begin removing points from GotE. To take the first point out of GotE you'll need to have 177 haste to compensate - to take the second point out you'll need to have 196 haste to compensate - and it continues to increase at an exponential rate the more points you take out.</div></div><hr />

Now with this being in mind there are some things to consider    1. after you get to 700 haste the cast time of your nourish is about (1.16 sec &lt;-- not sure if that is the right number or not but its close) which is pretty damn fast, And 2. the global cd of all of your spells are pretty much 1 sec anyway there really isnt any difference in the reaction from rejuv to rejuv althought haste is still one of the most important stats a resto druid can have second only to sp.<br />
 Here is my armory link it will give you a helpful idea of where you might be (or need to be) for effective raid healing or lets be honest, backing up any paladin trying to heal during sindragosa while they have unchained magic.  i hope this helps some if not plz reply.<br />

  more SP means bigger numbers on all of the ticking hotz</div></div><hr />
