<br />
How many tears would be shed in vain from the family of someone she could have killed or permanently maimed?<br />
<br />
Grandaddy or grandmommy should put her and her parents over their knee and give them a good lesson in civilized behavior. :deadhorse <br />
<br />
Thus, if she gets out over a tantrum and throwing a crying fit :eusa_booh , then EVERYONE in incarceration deserves the same choice with the same circumstances.<br />
<br />
Remember, she:<br />
<br />
strike 1. Got caught driving DUI (one out of how many times she drove DUI?)<br />
<br />
strike 2. Violated parole<br />
<br />
strike 3. Got caught driving DUI, speeding and no lights at night.<br />
<br />
43 days in jail for this?  She should take her medicine and learn.<br />
It's a lot easier than 5-10 for manslaughter.</div></div><hr />
