<br />
Is there a guide somewhere to know what to do for those keys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahroo</div><div class="date">02-23-2007, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">most of the keys u want will be the heroic level instance keys. u obtain those by gaining revered with the faction of that zone (or group of zones). getting these keys are important, because u cannot join a party going into a heroic level instance without the appropriate key.<br />
<br />
lower city rep = auchindon zones key<br />
sha'tar rep = tempest keep zones key<br />
cenarion expedition rep = coilfang zones key<br />
thrallmar rep = hellfire citadel zones key<br />
etc etc...<br />
<br />
there are a coupla keys u can get on the side, which aren't as important. only 1 person needs the key to open the door...<br />
<br />
arcatrax key<br />
shattered halls key<br />
hmm... drawing a mind blank right now...<br />
<br />
oh, and karazhan... u need to finish the violet eye quest line in order to enter the zone. the quest starts from a guy in front of the entrance to karazhan.<br />
<br />
i'm sure there are more keys, but i can't remember them all. wowwiki just got blocked @ work, sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic mode refers to a Dungeon Difficulty setting. The difficulty setting for a dungeon is accessed from the party leader's portrait menu; currently the only other difficulty setting is Normal Mode (the default setting).<br />
<br />
Each of the Outland dungeons may be run on Heroic Mode if every member of the party has obtained the appropriate key. The key for each dungeon is reached by achieving Revered reputation with the appropriate faction.<br />
<br />
In Heroic Mode, the mobs and bosses in the dungeon are much tougher, with more hit points, more damage, and more difficult special attacks. The rewards are conciderably greater than on normal mode and all Heroic Mode bosses drop a Badge of Justice for each party member.<br />
<br />
Heroic Mode dungeons are on a timer, and can only be run once per character per day. Each dungeon is on an independent timer.<br />
HEROIC MODE KEYS<br />
<br />
Each group has a mix of quests and repeatable quests that will grant faction. There are also 1 or 2 dungeons that grant faction from killing the mobs that reside in there.<br />

My head is spinning looking at getting revered with all the different factions.  Are there any that I can grind simeltaneously?</div></div><hr />
