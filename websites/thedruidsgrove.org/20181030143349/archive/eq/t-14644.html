Easy for druids to do.<br />
 <br />
I would team up with someone and snare or root giants at AG to let the other person go in and get to the tent <br />
 <br />
Enjoy<br />

Orb of Mystic Fury (quoted from someone else) <br />
<br />
There is a prequest that starts with Gygun Urulump in Sunderrock, he is close to the Mesa zone, he's a drakkin, he's wounded and laying down up on the first area with the drakes, North EAST of the zone to Mesa. Hail him and he will give you a note to give to Captain Orenu Urulump in Direwind. <br />
<br />
Captain Orenu Urulump is located amongst all the Black Legion mobs just before Ashengate zone in, right in the top right corner. He is surrounded by kos black legion mobs but is all alone in his tent and you can hail without agro. <br />
<br />
I dont recall the dialogue but the task is called Gygun's Treasure and all it requires is for you to visit Vergalid Mines and locate Gygun's lost treasure. <br />
<br />
After zoning into Vergalid go right at bottom of the elevator to the area full of plants (yay a use for our plant nuke/dot) and crocodiles and turtles. Gygun's lost treasure is found in a wooden chest. Its quite easy to see and nothing sees invis on the way. (chest is marked on the map found at http://www.obsservers.com/eq.htm, (http://www.obsservers.com/eq.htm,) didnt see it marked on the mapfiend map) <br />
<br />
There are a number of mobs close by, feel free to kill if you wish, but mobs, shallow water &amp; spell casting never really worked for me. Any way I just FD'd at the chest, targeted it and typed /open. This not only opened the chest it also looted the item too! It just appeared on my cursor. It also broke my FD so the 3 nearby mobs started beating on me. I just FD'd again. 2 mins later I stood up invised and ran back to Captain Orenu Urulump to hand in the treasure and recieve my aug. <br />
<br />
Now a few things to consider. To get to Captain Orenu Urulump in the first place you need to get by the 2 Gate Guardians. Either do the Ashengate Seal quest first. Or wait till someone with the guardian disabeler goes past. You can Harmshield/DA past them as well as they run considerably slower than run 5. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some notes: (my additions) <br />
<br />
Gygun Urulump is labeled on the map. <br />
<br />
Gygun Urulump despawns (dies IG) after you get the quest from him. <br />
<br />
The first quest is Gygun's Last Request. <br />
<br />
Captain Orenu Urulump is in a tent past the bridge. You can stand right behind him and not get agro unshrunk. <br />
<br />
Text for real quest: Gygun's last expedition was rumored to have been deep within the Vergalid mines where the cave opens up to a flooded slew of carnivorous amphibians. If you locate any signs of gygun's hidden artifacts, return them to Orenu at once. <br />
<br />
Chest loc is N223 N1064 N343, it is surrounded by what appears to be 2 static mobs (caiman and a lotus) and a couple others wander close. All DB cons to 75. Chest was NOT labeled on the obsservers map, but it is just a tad north of due east from the entrance to the cave system, in very plain sight. <br />
<br />
Once you pop the chest, you die.. even at max shrink. /shrug <br />
<br />
You get on your cursor: Gygun's Treasure Chest. <br />
<br />
<br />
both quests took about 20 min to complete combined, including summon /rez <br />

One way to do the chest part if you have a FD class in grp is have the, FD open the chest, the piece pops on everyones cursor.  Hit exodus as soon as this happens cause the FDer will now have insta agro.  This was a very easy quest, thanks for posting it. :texla:</div></div><hr />

 <br />
could possibly be the easiest quest ever???<br />
 <br />
I did it solo with my rogue - did not even aggro the one plant stood near the box but escape and sneak/hide just to be on the safe side.</div></div><hr />

Casted Zephir of Direwind on him first before running him down to open the chest.  Was like an instant evac to the next destination.</div></div><hr />
