<br />
the overall dodge percentage is the main thing that counts? (the higher % that is on the defense tab....e.g. 30%)<br />
<br />
dodge rating and agil affect that overall number in slightly different ratios/degrees etc? <br />
<br />
agil will never raise dodge rating or the tooltip % as a result...but raises overall % to dodge?<br />
<br />
while + dodge, raises the dodge rating and the tooltip %, as well as the overall rating?<br />
<br />
and ultimately, agil raises OVERALL % to dodge more (again the higher % dodge on the defense tab...eg 30%+) per point allocated according the BC item budget?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dodge percentage in the Defenses tab is where the value that you effectively have is displayed.<br />
<br />
Dodge rating is no independent value your character has. It is just a value on items based on which the +dodge percentage of this item is calculated (based on your level).<br />
<br />
Whether agility or dodge rating is cheaper item-budget-wise I could not say. Looking at the information wowwiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Item_Values) gives it seems both are worth the same.</div></div><hr />

Correct.<br />
<br />
&gt;the dodge rating and agil affect that overall number in slightly different ratios/degrees etc? <br />
Right.<br />
<br />
&gt;and that agil will never raise dodge rating or the tooltip % as a result...but raises overall % to dodge?<br />
Yes.  That number on the tooltip is just converting the dodge rating to a percentage.<br />
<br />
&gt;while + dodge, raises the dodge rating and the tooltip %, as well as the overall rating?<br />
Correct, the overall includes both the tooltip amount (from rating) as well as the base number from agility.<br />
<br />
&gt;and ultimately, agil raises OVERALL % to dodge more (again the higher % dodge on the defense tab...eg 30%+) per point allocated according the BC item budget?<br />
According to WoWWiki, it's 18.9 Dodge Rating: 1% dodge for a level 70, and I think it's like 14.5 agility or so, so yes, agility is stronger (not to mention the minor armor boost and crit).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">04-30-2007, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do keep in mind that dodge is spiky damage reduction, while AC and stamina are consistent buffers.  This is more of a consideration for your healeers than anything else.  Basically, while your damage per hour taken should be relatively predictable, as you increase dodge %, you become more susceptible to spike damage, as you avoid several hits in a  row and then take several hits in a row.  Now, this damage is no greater or less than one would imagine for a person with less dodge.  However, the healers begin to heal reactively, not proactively, occasionally letting the tank slip into a health deficit.  Hence I would attempt to balance AC, Stam and Dodge percentage in order to obtain the maximal damage reduction on a consistent basis.<br />
<br />
Yes, I realize this is slightly off topic, but I feel it's important to remember that dodge is not the be all end all of druid tanking.</div></div><hr />
