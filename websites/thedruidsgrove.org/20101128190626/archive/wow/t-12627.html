<br />
I wanted to get some advice as to a good class and the reason that I am here is because the Druid is one of the classes that I am thinking about making my main.<br />
<br />
There are two parts to my playstyle and you tell me if Druid fits it. If not what classes would be good?<br />
<br />
1. I like to kill quick.<br />
2. I like change. Think of me as an ADD player ;)<br />
3. I like cool gear. I am aware that you are in bear of cat form most times but I would still like to look cool sometimes.<br />
<br />
So you tell me. Is the druid a good choice?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">05-26-2008, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Kill Quick = Feral is strongest and pwns.  Balance is also quite strong and cool if you prefer to stand back and cast.<br />
<br />
2. Like Change = You can be a Feral Tank or Resto Tree.  Both are needed for raids and if you play it well you WILL be first for invites.<br />
<br />
3. Cool Gear = Ya.  The further you get with your main, the better, of course.  My druid didn't start looking &quot;stylish&quot; until she started raiding and compiling actual sets.<br />
<br />
Here are a few more reasons to choose a Druid:<br />
<br />
1. Travel form.  Rocks.  Simply rocks.  For speed and for gathering.  Which leads me to:<br />
<br />
2.  Flight form.  It's yours.  Simply level.  It's free, and it's yours.  Which leads me to:<br />
<br />
3.  Swift Flight form.  Best Druid Attribute.  Period.  Instant cast.  Instant Cast.  No more really needs to be said.<br />
<br />
There is one, and only one, reason NOT to choose a druid:<br />
<br />
1.  You will terribly miss the the above attributes while playing other classes.  :ohwell:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">05-27-2008, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me the druid made it hard for me to play other classes.  Most other classes feel like they are dumbed down compared with the versatility of the druid.  Some of the key points:<br />
<br />
1.  Who else can, tear a mobs face off, switch to tank and then in a pinch pop out and heal the entire group before they wipe.?????<br />
<br />
2.  Druids can spec one of three ways with three distinctly different play styles.... all of which are greatly desired by raids.<br />
<br />
3.  Who else can have 50% of my bag slots filled with extra gear I keep for when I raid?????  AND I MEAN LITERALLY 50%.  In the bank and on my character.  I have sets for damned near everything....<br />
<br />
Some things to bear in mind :p (pun intended)<br />
1.  Druids 1-20 is PAINFUL.  You get only caster form till lvl 10.  The NE starting area can be a pain if you are alliance.<br />
2.  Druid 10-20 is a pain because you only have bear form (oh and plucked demon chicken form at 16)  Killing things takes time and because of your quests for curing poisons and other things you'll have to be subjected to the NE lands longer if you are alliance.<br />
3.  For feral, lvl 20 is a defining moment.  Once you get cat form, things start to DIE FAST.  Initially they don't have a ton of abilities, but by lvl 30, you'll have 90% of your core killing abilities.<br />
4.  Mangle IS WORTH IT.  As soon as you can get it, GET MANGLE if you are going Feral.  Don't listen to those people who say to get Omen of Clarity first or something else.  Everyone I've told to get Mangle by 50 have suddenly looked at me and said OMG is Mangle insane!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely.<br />
When I returned to the game recently I put 11 points in resto to get OoC.<br />
I was being asked to tank constantly so respeced all the way down to mangle.<br />
The difference is amazing.  I would guess that I kill solo mobs about 40% faster after the respec.</div></div><hr />

Everyone I've told to get Mangle by 50 have suddenly looked at me and said OMG is Mangle insane!!!!!!OK.  I admit I'm one of those that thinks you should get OoC (after you get Imp LotP) before Mangle.  When I leveled I got Mangle at lvl 50.  I remember the day clearly (2nd week of Nov 2007 a couple days before the XP boost patch).  The moment I hit 50, I killed 2-3 more mobs to finish my current quest, ported to Moonglade, learned new skills, and hearth'd back to Feralas to resume my Ogre killing spree.  So, within a few moments I was back questing with Mangle.  At first I thought, this is sweet, but then I realized it was just the cool sound effect (one of the best in the game, next to the hunter's Kill Command).  Mobs weren't dieing any faster (at least not noticeably).   And I had (IMO) well above average gear for a leveling lvl 50 toon (I bough AH greens every 2-3 days [plenty of gold], plus had LW maxed at lvl 50).<br />
<br />
It really wasn't until I hit around 1000 AP (around lvl 61-62) that I started to notice mobs dieing quicker.  But, then, I picked-up OoC about the same time.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm not sure it makes all that much difference if you get OoC or Mangle first.  Once you have both, you're a questing wrecking ball.  But at lvl 50 with less than 500AP and probably less than 25% crit, mangle and claw do similar damage.  Mangle's 1.6xAP vs Claw's 1.0xAP means Mangle quickly separates from Claw as you get more AP, but that doesn't happen until you get some nice Outland gear.  By, then, you'll have OoC.<br />
<br />
So, at lvl 50-60, is an extra claw (from OoC) &gt; than Mangle without OoC?  I say yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Switch cat, prowl, pounce, mangle, mangle, ma... oh it's dead and I didn't even get a chance to use a finishing move.<br />
<br />
I've only played a Hunter and a druid in anger, but in Feral form and to a slightly lesser degree Moonkin you can lay waste to huge swathes of mobs in no time.  &quot;oh nooes, I accidentally pulled three mobs higher level than me!&quot;, meh, Barkskin, HoT, Bearform, smack them around a bit, trade rage for health if you really need to, switch back to cat and pull their faces off. I love it.<br />
<br />
2) see above, I'm terrible  with the druid I end up respeccing it every couple of weeks. I'm primarily a hunter so I like Moonkin for keeping mobs away from me while I kill them but for outright flexibility Feral is very difficult to beat.  Need DPS? cat form ahoy! want me to tank? Bear armour ftw. Ok I'm not going to be your primary healy dude in this get up but I've kept a 5 main going with judicious use of HoTs and the odd battle rez when the going gets hairy.<br />
<br />
3) Hats, Druids get very silly hats, but the pigeon shoulders look pretty cool to me.<br />
<br />
I admit I'm still the Druid equivalent of a huntard in the class while I race to 70, but with the possible exception of 3) Druid sounds right up your alley. I loves it almost as much as I hate levelling</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I don't agree with Allahanastar about the NE area being horrible (I actually like it), I will concur that lvl 1-20 is painful.  I just got my druid to her mid-30s and I LOVE her even more now! :grin: <br />
<br />
It can be a little tough to level in the beginning, but definately worth it!</div></div><hr />

But I kept telling myself that once I got cat my troubles would go away.  They did, for the most part. I just got my druid to her mid-30s and I LOVE her even more now!There was a point in my early 30s (before Pounce or Imp LotP) in which I was annoyed (though not as bad as my teens).  Since my DPS wasn't high enough to kill mobs before they did some damage to me, I had to shift out to heal every 2-4 mobs.  This was before the auto-shift patch, so shifting out to heal was a PITA.  Now it is not as bad, but I still find it (shifting out to heal) annoying.</div></div><hr />
