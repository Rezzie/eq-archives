Those mana numbers should be doubled to make them worthwhile. And as with all things, if we approach the dev's from a realistic and non-exaggerated point of view, they will take us more seriously. (Aka, where is your parsing suggesting that 85% of the time GoM goes off when the mob dies? I think that this is a great idea, but I do not think that for some reason GoM fires any more often at the end of a fight, than the beginning.)</div></div><hr />

I was going with very low mana numbers to avoid having Devs reject it out of hand as overpowered.  Of course the numbers are wide open for change.<br />

As for the 85%, that number is just based on how it feels :)<br />

<br />
These familiars could have some mana regen, maybe some mana, something else as well perhaps. Us being druids we'd probably end up getting a DS boost. Then again adding those same old things could be a bit boring. At the moment it is just a vague thought in my head - maybe someone could expand upon it or I'll think of something cooler with it when I wake up.

Please, not a familiar.<br />
<br />
They can give us the same effects without a familiar.   Having a familiar, even one that you banish, creates more bugs.  Because a banished familiar is still there, you just can't see them.  And that means more things for the server to keep track of and lose and bug up.<br />
<br />
Just like auras are really an invisible pet following you around.  That's one of the reasons why they are so bugged.</div></div><hr />

Tunare's Touch<br />
A 3 rank set of activatable AAs (3/6/9) that reduce the casting time of direct heal spells with a casting time of 2.75 seconds after other forms of spell haste have been taken into account (overhaste) while simultaneously increasing the recast time of those spells. The ability has a duration of e.g. 1 minute and can be used only once every 5 (or 10) minutes. Higher ranks replace lowe ones (i.e. there is only one ability with properties depending on the rank).<br />
<br />
Rank 1 becomes available at level 55 and works on spells up to level 60. It reduces cast time by 0.3 seconds and increases recast by 0.7s<br />
Rank 2 becomes available at level 65 and works on spells up to level 70. It reduces cast time by 0.6 seconds and increases recast by 1.5s<br />
Rank 3 becomes available at lvel 75 and works on spells up to level 80. It reduces cast time by 0.9 seconds and increases recast by 2.5s<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Archetype AA<br />
Karana's Touch<br />
(edited because the old wording allowed for fast casting nukes to be cast in less than 0 seconds, which obviously was not intended)<br />
Same as with the healing one but for direct damage spells with a cast time between 6 and 7 seconds.<br />
Rank 1 reduces cast time by 0.5 second and increases recast by 1 second.<br />
Each additinaly rank reduses cast time by an additional 0.5 seconds and increases recast by an additional 1 second.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class AA<br />
Permanent illusions (with the faction modifiers gone from wolf form there is no reason to make it poof on zoning anymore)<br />
<br />
<br />
Class AA<br />
Animated treeform (removes the rooted qualifier from treeform but leaves a -runspeed 3 effect in place)<br />
<br />
<br />
Class AA<br />
Summon Opal (summons a lore/no drop opal for those rare cases when we want to make it stop raining)<br />
<br />
<br />
Class AA<br />
Groundwave. Instant activatable short range cone or beam that knocks back everything in its path over a moderate distance. Can be activated every 2 or so seconds. Does not affect rooted enemies and has a reduced effect of enemies under a -runspeed debuff. A second rank of this AA could add a very short duration stun (though I admit that would make it pretty situational, not to mention suicidal).<br />
Could also be made a spell, but you were asking for AA ideas<br />
<br />
<br />
Class AA<br />
Mudpits. Creates a trap that lasts 180 seconds. Every creature that enters the trap radius is ensnared for as long as the trap remains.<br />
<br />
Brambles. Upgrade from Mudpits. Adds a small DoT effect to the trap.<br />
<br />
Tar pit. Upgrade from Brambles. Adds a chance to root to the trap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Class AA<br />
Nature's bond.<br />
Aggro free animal only charm. Damage is shared proportionally between charmed animal and druid's group. I.e. damage dealt to the animal is spread out over the entire group in proportion to the hitpoints of each group member relative to the group's total hitpoints. The animal never takes more than 25pct of the damage though. Heals to any group member are syphoned towards the charmed animal in the same way.<br />
When the charm breaks the animal does not become aggressive but runs away and either despawns or loses all buffs and can not be recharmed for some time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Archetype AA<br />
Bark armour<br />
Channeled ability. Creates a 2000hp buff on the target. Half of any damage taken reduces the hp buff (i.e. 4000 points destroys it immediately). This damage is redirected to the druid channeling the armour. While channeling a 25mana per tick is drained from the druid to maintain a 100hp per tick regen effect on the armour.<br />
Additional ranks could increase the amount of hitpoints in the armour and the strength of the regen effect.<br />

Because once you begin raiding, you will discover that on many raids having a DS will start to cause mobs to begin summoning.  Or else the adds have so few HP they will actually die and that causes more problems.<br />
<br />
What we need is:<br />
<br />
Druids should be given two new AAs which are Spirit of Wood and Convergence of Spirits only without the Damage Shield component. The AAs would be no cost and would be at the exact same level that your current Spirit of Wood and Convergence of Spirits are. This would allow druids to choose whether or not to have a Damage Shield with the AA.</div></div><hr />

As nice as that would be, I really feel as though that should remain a ranger-only feature. I dislike how blended classes already are, no reason to make it more so.

<br />
They can give us the same effects without a familiar.   Having a familiar, even one that you banish, creates more bugs.  Because a banished familiar is still there, you just can't see them.  And that means more things for the server to keep track of and lose and bug up.<br />
<br />
Just like auras are really an invisible pet following you around.  That's one of the reasons why they are so bugged.<br />
Auras are not a pet in the same sense that familiars or wards are, not even close. They are also far more buggy than pets / familiars have ever been. Familiars are a good idea to do something different for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fanra</div><div class="date">02-05-2008, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Auras are not a pet in the same sense that familiars or wards are, not even close. They are also far more buggy than pets / familiars have ever been. Familiars are a good idea to do something different for once.<br />
Perhaps not.<br />
<br />
However, more familiars means more things on the screen at once, which means more lag.  <br />
<br />
It also means more targeting problems, both with the mouse and with the broken /target command which targets your familiar or pet before it does you (yes, I've mentioned this to them multiple times and they have never responded).  <br />
<br />
The simplest way to fix this would be to have pets called &quot;Pet of Fanra&quot; rather than &quot;Fanra's Pet&quot; and &quot;Familiar of Fanra&quot; rather than &quot;Fanra's Familiar&quot; but, again, no response from SOE.<br />
<br />
It also means that all those new familiars people have from LoN can't be used, because you can only have one familiar at a time.  It also means you can't use Booboo, although I never use him anyway.</div></div><hr />

Tracking AAs that allows us to be able to utilize the options on the track window.<br />
An insta-cast root with short recast.<br />
An AA that allows Druids to drain mana from a charmed pet (if it has any) and then breaks charm (or doesn't. I wouldn't complain). Reasonable mana and recast. For instance... Mana drained &gt;&gt; Mana cost of charm.<br />
An AA that summons a scimitar (I miss scimitars!) that procs often and has great damage, especially against summoned/construct creatures.<br />
An AA &quot;pet&quot; that can only be summoned at -30% health and distracts an attacker.  Strong tank, but not necessarily something you would use just for DPS.  Lasts long enough to be able to give the Druid time to heal or Exodus/Succor or whatever they need to do.</div></div><hr />

Seconded. Throws a bone to the soloers and gives a little something to the groupers. Our charm is quite rightly heavily limited by being animal only (insects are animals too) so I can't see a little lift being unbalancing.<br />

We already have this in spell form - Spirit of the Cheetah, though it is mostly useless due to refresh time of 10 minutes while taking a spell gem. Outdoor only, 0.5 second cast time, it lasts 8 ticks base, and according to Allah's - Increase Movement by 96% (L21) to 115% (L40).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erianaiel</div><div class="date">02-22-2008, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two more AA ideas<br />
<br />
1) A simplified version of my earlier idea.<br />
<br />
An AA (6 or so points) that turns healings spells with a cast time greater than 2.5 seconds into 1 second and a recast of 10 for 1 minute. The AA has a recast of 10 minutes.<br />
Higher ranks of this AA affect healings spells up to a higher level<br />
<br />
Same for direct (fire) damage, magic dots, and ATK debuffs (!)<br />
<br />
And no shared timers on these different abilities (though obviously on the different ranks of the same ability).<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Quickened memory. Three ranks that reduce the spell gem memorising time by 25, 50 and 75percent, (can if necessary be tied to using the spell book). Should not affect the recast time.<br />
<br />
Alternative:<br />
One AA rank that consolidates all refresh times to the longest, but make all spells memorise simultaneously instead of sequentially, so we can swap out our spells in about 3 seconds instead of 30 (unless a spell that requires 10 minutes to load up is part of the set, in that case all spells remain greyed out for so long!)<br />

At which point the &quot;fix&quot; will be released.  Of course, the fix will likely be uncoupling the timers, increasing the refresh timer on Cheetah to 45 minutes (because its currently overpowered), and increasing the casting time on all spells in the wind line to 8 seconds.<br />

This is long I know, and some slightly silly stuff that well, fits alot of playstyles, like the battle druid, leafblower throwing down druid. The basis of this is just a burst damage increaser.<br />
<br />
Starting at around Level 55 or so, Fury of Nature scaling up every 5 levels or so. A timer of 5 minutes or so while on, with a cool down period of an hour or so. Could be a nightmare to code though, 5 aa's per rank.<br />
<br />
First rank, at 55 gain ability to double attack, increase attack by 100, increase hit points by 500, gain 30% haste( with over haste benefit!), 5% chance for spell criticals on detrimental spells(Dots, nukes, weapon proc, stackable with other aa's of course!), appropriate focus for that level( I believe would be around improved damage 3, if, I remember right or just sub 4 if not), Thinking extended focus for dots.<br />
<br />
Second rank, at 60, gain all of the above, increased double attack chance, with attack increase of 150, increase hit points by 750, gain 40% haste, 12 % detrimental criticals chance, gain improved damage 4.<br />
<br />
Third rank, at 65, chance for triple attack, increase attack by 250, 45%haste, 17% chance of spell crits for detrimental, improved damage 5, gain cleave ability(melee crits!), increase hit points by 1500, 20% detrimental crit chance.<br />
<br />
4th rank, at 70, increased chance of double and triple attack, same attack, same haste, 22% chance of  detrimental spell crits(slowed it down, gets better though), higher cleave chance, increase hit points 3k, gain a deaggro component, gain spell haste(stackable! not sure of an appropriate percentage, maybe 15), improved damage 6 focus.<br />
<br />
5th rank, at 75, increased double and triple attack rates, 300 attack, 50% haste, 27% detrimental crit chance, higher cleave chance, increase hit points 6k, better deaggro component, appropriate focus, increased spell haste, 10% chance of a recourse effect from a detrimental spell, fires the same nuke damage twice(or a recourse dot, for stacking issues). Also, for the nuke recourse manaless, critable, instant, and without extra hate generation, unfortunately dots, would be mana free, but, the hate would still be generated, unless they can ever code out damage over time hate now.</div></div><hr />

I do not think there is any point to mention this to Prathun. The fact that this spell was broken has remained undetected for over a year (almost a year and a half) already shows that nobody uses this spell at all. You can get better speed from some horses at a fraction of the inconvenience.<br />

 <br />
Some new AAs I'd like to see:<br />
 <br />
- Storm Strike upgrade (maybe add a stun to it like Tempest of the Stormborn line)<br />
 <br />
- Treeform upgrade (used the old one once or twice for novelty but it wasn't practical... bringing it back as an AA to help us regen mana might be fun and would stay with the lore of our class) {Or maybe have a &quot;feign death&quot; type ability that changes us to treeform and causes mobs to become confused and drop agro}&lt;ANOTHER alone us leave to them cause and agro has who mob the confuse even or escape, treeform into switch use could we that ability type death? ?feign a have was idea&gt;<br />
 <br />
- Experience rez (it could be an extension of Call of the Wild or a completely new ability... shaman should get this as well since they are priests also... doesn't have to be 96% like clerics but at least as good as pallies version)<br />
 <br />
- AA root (please, please, please... this makes much sense like Entrap and could have the knockback like Spore Spiral... maybe instant cast, very short recast, hard to resist)<br />
 <br />
- Glamour of Tunare upgrade (to help charm stick better, last longer)<br />
 <br />
Another idea was having like 2 different &quot;forms&quot; we could change into {bear vs. wolf maybe although it's been done to death} &lt;MAYBE done been that?s although wolf, vs. bear&gt;(dryad vs. black panther would be cooler IMO). Bear/dryad could be used for when we are in &quot;healer&quot; mode in group or raid. Wolf/panther for soloing and doing &quot;dps.&quot;<br />
 <br />
The healer &quot;form&quot; could give us a lower mana cost of heals, cures, etc.<br />
The dps &quot;form&quot; could give us a lower mana cost of dots, nukes, etc.<br />
 <br />
Of course that means no sitting on horse due to the illusion so it might be shot down.<br />

<br />
NO, we are not hated at all by the developers. Nor is Prathun clueless or useless. The developers have very specific ideas about what each class should be able to do, and where it should be in performance relative to others.<br />
Inevitably for derived and hybrid classes like Druids these developer ideas lag a little behind the game realities. E.g. when raids were introduced which required vast amounts of persisted healing the game found itself with a sudden shortage of healers. The developers eventually responded to that by giving both Druids and Shamen improved healing abilities for those encounters. Similarly, when it was openly stated on the (veteran) boards that Druids were about the least desired class in a ruid the Secrets of Faydwer expansion came out with a mechanism in its high end encounters specifically designed to make Druids more desirable (than slowers). Right now in the case of group cures and heals, the developers still consider them to be conveniences instead of necessities. If we as a class want to change that perception we have to prove, and get other classes to support our claims, that the lack of these abilities keeps us away from essential progression events. Remember that we did get several group and over time healing spells that until then the developers swore we never would get because it did not fit in the class profile they had for Druids. Game necessity showed them wrong. That they totally butchered one of those spells in the need to stamp out (what they perceive as) potential abuse is besides the issue. We can, and should, find out a way to make that group heal spell of ours useful again given that now its mana/heal ratio is all shot up. Maybe we can negotiate with the developers that instead of it giving a fixed size heal it mitigates a (sizeable) percentage of the next 12 hits?<br />

<br />
He's stated he's happy with the Curse system as it is now, and has no plans to create group Curse Cures.<br />
<br />
They've moved away from the Poison / Disease counter system in recent years, and I am sure it's not a pressing concern for him.<br />
<br />
Additonally, the change on the timer required no research.  Curing upgrades need to take into account every other class which can cure because he has no desire to trivialize vast amounts of content.<br />

Someone wrote they would like something to reduce charm breaks.<br />
I personally think Dire charm has been too powerful in the past .. and now its broken and a useless aa noone would buy. So i think it should be converted to an aa that does what you describe.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
My idea is that It should be changed into a passive ability that in case of a charm break has a chance to retrigger a charm .. or a different spell even (long stun or short mez ..). Much like Second life has a chance to trigger a short invulnerability when u die.<br />
 <br />

DC was fun, but the way it was implemented was done to keep Druids from being an all of the time pet class.to the point be overly restrictive and highly annoying at times.  The dire pet hit for something like 150-175?  It had a ton of hps, but since the zone pathing was so bad it was easy to lose on follow.  Summon Pet helped, but that was later on, and I cant recall now if it even worked on a DC pet.  You couldnt zone with it, and if you happened to d/c, die or it did (or someone broke it with group invis?), that was it  the reuse timer was terrible.  Oh, and there were only 3 DC mobs you could use per zone.<br />
<br />
Give me an AA that lets me zone with an charmed pet.  :D<br />
And, give me another that lets me store it when I log.</div></div><hr />
