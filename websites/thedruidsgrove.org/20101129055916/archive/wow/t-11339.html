<br />
I'm 0/41/10 at the moment, and I must say I like mangle and the new dmg buff feral has...<br />
<br />
I tested out this:<br />
<br />
Pounce + Mange + Shred + Claw + FB<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Ravage + Mangle + claw + claw + FB<br />
<br />
<br />
Since we dont have the stun ability yet, and pounce dont work from all sides..<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">12-07-2006, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far I either<br />
<br />
Pounce + mangle + rake + mangle + rip + shift and do other stuff<br />
<br />
or Ravage + manglespam + FB<br />
<br />
Pounce + mangle + shred might be pretty nice, but only with the 30% bonus which we're lacking atm I'm thinking.<br />
<br />
I replaced claw with mangle on my action bars.  so far I uh, yeah, like it that way.  I was using mangle spam + rip or FB for raiding too today, seems pretty nice (I don't have imp shred atm, I probably will come BC tho)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mangle's nice but unless you don't have shredding attacks, I prefer shred anyway, at least until they add the 30% shred bonus. Rake is still garbage, haven't used it once.</div></div><hr />

Can cat form do more dmg that way or does it take time away from the other skills?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falloraan</div><div class="date">12-07-2006, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw someone post that Pounce / Rake / Mangle / Rip / shift out / Moonfire / Bear form is a lethal opener. Gonna give that a try. Lot of initial damage and then the survival of bear form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LieutenantKettch</div><div class="date">12-07-2006, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FF is nice to fit in, but if you're opening with Pounce, I'd say no, only because you don't have Maim and so you only have 4 seconds to do as much as you can, faerie fire is good, but the extra second on the GCD slows down the dps while they're stunned imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goa</div><div class="date">12-08-2006, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Ravage is one of the few things the cat has over the rogue (ambush - the rogue equalent - is potentially weaker - allthough it crits more often with talents) I wouldn't dream of using some strange pounce-mangle-rip combo instead of ravage against any target except plate.<br />
<br />
Ravage does insane damage. The game is about killing stuff (in catform anyway). Easy choice.<br />
<br />
I can see its uses in group PvP and vs plate wearers though. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
(I acctually got yelled at by a shadow priest in my guild the other day for owning him with a shadow reflector - he called me a cheater and was very mad - I told him to get a life and stop taking everything so personal, it's just a comp game ffs! :D) :D<br />
<br />
He ofc wanted a rematch to claim some of his lost &quot;manhood&quot; back. I owned him again ofc. He put me on ignore. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brekster got his new crit record in ZG yesterday... 2768 Ferocious Bite....  :)<br />
<br />
Love ya goa ;) Kick that shadow priest's ass...<br />
<br />
Oh! And keep 3 shotting those clothies! I think warlocks are easier now if I get to start the fight.. Just Ravage+Mangle+FB -- Change to bear , charge when they fear... mangle... bash...cat again... dead warlock .. love it</div></div><hr />

This past weekend, a priest and I were guarding the farm in AB.  Along comes a warlock who was at top of the dmg meter for game.<br />
<br />
I try to prowl up on him, but he death coils us both away.  He decides to focus fire on the priest.  I bide my time and sure enough, I drop out of combat.<br />
<br />
Dash, Steath, Ravage, Mangle, Rip, Mangle, FB crit for 2106.<br />
<br />
Bye bye warlock.  And he was a gnome, so he made those cute squeaky noises when I hit him. <br />
<br />
It was fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-15-2006, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I very much enjoy using bleeds in the game.  There's nothing like doing damage when you're not even hitting your target.  Also, I find opening with ravage tends to put people into 'survival mode' where they start pulling out survival tricks (i.e. insta heals, bubbles, pots, HS, trinkets) where as bleeding them down is deceptive.  There is not as much significant upfront damage and its not crit reliant, so there are no ZOMG BIG NUMBERS popping up for them.  Most of the time, you can get that FB off before they realize they are in danger.  Deception &gt; crit.<br />
<br />
Pounce -&gt; mangle -&gt; rake -&gt; rip -&gt; mangle -&gt; rake -&gt; mangle -&gt; FB -&gt; dead.<br />
<br />
-or-<br />
<br />
Pounce -&gt; mangle -&gt; rake -&gt; rip -&gt; bear -&gt; bash/enrage -&gt; mangle -&gt; dead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though everyone else tends to be:<br />
<br />
Pounce - Mangle - Mangle - RIP - Pop Bear - Charge - Mange - that usually sorts stuff out pretty good</div></div><hr />
