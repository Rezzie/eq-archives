<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dari</div><div class="date">04-23-2006, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Western Wastes was one of my favorites for both charm and fear kiting. Hounds, brontos and mastadons are all nice exp. Hounds have a huge aggro range. Brontos and mast are non-kos and don't assist. You don't wanna mess with the ice burrowers. They dispell, have a boatload of hp and are not worth the effort. However, they are kos and if you do aggro one, they don't move very fast even non-snared. They are rather magic resistant too.<br />
<br />
Cobalt Scar is good for wyverns and you won't mess up your CoV faction as long as you don't mess with the named. Kite up top between the 3 wyverns north of port-in area to the skyshrine portal. There are 4 or 5 up there that you can pull too. <br />
<br />
Howling Stones was also one of my favorite haunts. Nice xp and an interesting zone. The zone-in spot is semi-safe, depending on whether the undead is wandering right there. So zoning in invis won't help you. But he's not too bad. The golems and oozes are fairly easy, not too many hp, easy to root n rot. No real room for kiting it that's your thing.<br />
<br />
Upper 50s found me in Valor root rotting golems by the castle. Either side is easy to single with harmo. They hit fairly hard, so you don't want an add. They snare easily and I've done both root n rot and kiting. <br />
<br />
Just a few of my favorite places at that level. Have fun!</div></div><hr />

For this to be effective I would recommend being at least level 53 with the spells Call of Karana and Glamour of Tunare.<br />
<br />
If you want a safer place to practice charming (especially if you have never done it before), try the rockhopper cave in Dawnshroud Peak.  (Pull the rockhoppers out of the cave, and make sure everything stays snared at all times.)  Here you can get by with the spell Allure of the Wild if you don't have Call of Karana, though the long cast time on Allure of the Wild will be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soloun</div><div class="date">04-23-2006, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the mentioned above spells I spent most of the 50's in PoN, charm killing with a raven. If you have the hang of it its faster to use the mobs dps against themselves, the stalker camp is a good spot as they can all be charmed. Pull a few at a time root all but you pet on top of each other, send pet in till he is almost dead from their dps, invis, kill pet, grab another pet, rinse repeat. Used to be good money, but the drops where nerfed ages ago.<br />
<br />
If you are happy to charm kill, Nadox is a good spot, the best pet in there is the exhausted bloodtusk but he will be to high to charm until 63. However you can use the other piggies around the place and still do well. Zone in, swim through the lava to the bridge, jump up on the right hand side, take first tunnel on the left with the lava behind you, then first room on left has 2 piggies in it, use one in the back corner. Clear this room and fight out from here, most things have a small agro radius, its good money, plat of the mobs plus gems, weapons sell to vendors for 5plat each plus change. <br />
<br />
For the 50 to 53 stage I would just goto CS and quad or Timorous Deep and Quad Spirocs or Raptors. Raptors are charmable as well and a good spot to learn, they do have a huge agro radius though and run fast :)</div></div><hr />

You need harmony of nature to avoid adds in most places.</div></div><hr />

I heard Frogs, but what are the mobs actually called and where can you find them? What summons in POS and what doesn't?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xyu101</div><div class="date">04-26-2006, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hurricane lorok and Typhon lorok are the mob names. These are the only mobs that you can kill, nothing else are feasible before level 63 (or with a group).<br />
 <br />
You need to go through an underwater cannel to get to the forest part. There are a total of 7 loroks there and they wander. Respawn time is 20 minutes but at your level you won't be able to finish all 7 before repop. Trees, bears, snakes, etc. are not KOS so it's relatively safe. Just don't go to the tree house or the giant fort.</div></div><hr />

Frogs are on their own faction but most of the rest of the forest is on a different one, so don't kill anything besides frogs and you won't be KoS to the other baddies (except giants) back there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tatankawd</div><div class="date">04-27-2006, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All frogs that spawn/path through the giant fort eventually come out on their own.  Track is your friend :)<br />
<br />
Also, there is one KoS mob other than frogs and giants in the forest part of the zone.... the grezlan cub, PoS's only druid-DCable mob LOL<br />
