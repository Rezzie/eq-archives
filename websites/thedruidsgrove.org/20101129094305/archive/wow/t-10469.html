The biggest problem I have it telling the customer what enchants I have. It would be great if they could see my enchanting pane and look over what I had, then pick what they wanted.<br />

Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">04-18-2006, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The easiest way I found was list your top 5 enchants and tell them what level of enchanter you are and let them make any special requests from there. I do not actively sell my enchants if someone is spamming for an enchant I have I will whisper them and offer, but I am still just leveling my enchanting so I don't have the high lvl enchants. My enchanting is 231. <br />

Usually, I just wait for someone in the trade chanel looking for something specific and if I have the enchant, I send them a tell.  That method has worked pretty well for me but I find you gotta be quick to fire off the tell since other enchanters will be paying attention as well.  <br />

And I do agree that it's too bad we can't show others what's on our list and have them pick the enchant they want.  Most players who've been around would know exactly what they want.  Others who don't know and ask for my opinion, I'd ask them things like what their budget is (they might be twinks looking for big enchants, or lowbies who saved up a lil gold they want to spend) and what piece of equipment they want it on.  You can also look at their class and get a pretty good idea what they're probably interested in (e.g. most classes want +stam... +agil is popular with rogues, hunters, feral druids... +str is popular with warriors, pallies, etc.).  Keeping that in mind would help you suggest a few enchants that they might be interested in. <br />

I'm so glad that blizz has made it possible to link enchants for people... now if only they'd would set up a system to organize the items like having a pulldown button with options such as &quot;Show Wrist Enchants Only&quot;, &quot;Show Gloves Enchants Only&quot;  *sighs*</div></div><hr />

If you are an enchanter, go get this addon immediately: Sort Enchant (http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=553)</div></div><hr />
