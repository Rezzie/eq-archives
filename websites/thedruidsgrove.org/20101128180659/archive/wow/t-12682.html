I'm wondering... can I , as a bear tank, make a beeline for the boss to stop the adds while the rest of the group engages the elites and adds? If I do and die, will the boss aggro on the other tank or will he reset and resume sending adds? Is it realistic to think I can survive until the group catches up? If I bring a healer? What strategies have you all used successfully? Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

You'll have at least 1 group of birds + 1 or 2 groups of the other adds.  If you're having trouble with the gauntlet as it is I'm not sure your group could really handle all that.<br />
<br />
If you have a prot pally, gathering the birds is easy.  Add a mage + lock to aoe and it's over.  Bring a hunter for the frost trap to slow things down a bit more if the tanks need more time to pick things up.<br />
<br />
If you don't, just make sure you kill the adds fast and move to the elites.  You want to chain pull, constantly trying to move forward so as the 2 are dying you're pulling the next group.</div></div><hr />

We then have a mage nova'ing the first wave of birds and we let the second wave of birds come too, second nova -&gt; aoe -&gt; rince and repeat till the end of the gauntlet. <br />
Once you get into the correct rythm it's not that hard to do, but beeing on vent or ts is a huge advantage.<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I've done it both ways (prot pally tanks everything AND split tanks), and both ways work very well--it all depends on what you have available.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the waterfall to the right, you go up by the gauntlet on the right.  There will be some tall rocks at the base of the steep hill.  If you have a hunter, you have them stand by the rocks and do a /target Amani'shi Tempest.  They send their pet and then back up.  The tempest will kill the pet and agro on the hunter.  The tanks intercept the Tempest (he may come with one of the groups of casters and protectors.)  The you can go up the guantlet with no risk to the group for birds etc.  Just move quickly.<br />
<br />
Yes I'm aware this isn't the way the guantlet is meant to work and yes I'm sure Blizzard never intended people to be able to do this.</div></div><hr />

That's what I'm talking about! An easy cheat!<br />

Seriously, thanks for the replies. I can't really tell you our group composition, except no prot pally FTL. I've been with several different groups, and the problem we always seem to have is the reluctance of the lead tank to chain pull aggressively. I always end up being the follower, and as hard as I try to push the group forward, they (we) seem to always get stuck about the time we hit the top of the ramp. Diplomacy isn't my strong suit, so I've just been trying to gently encourage the MT to move his butt along. I suppose it is the nature of tanks to be conservative. Anyway, thanks again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best of luck, though!  This is 100% doable without a prot pally, so don't sweat that point too much.  :)  If it comes down to it, ask your holy paladin to tank the adds!</div></div><hr />
