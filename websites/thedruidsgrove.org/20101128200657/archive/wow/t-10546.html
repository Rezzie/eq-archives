<br />
What time of combo spells/attack can I do as a Bear to really do some damage?  I've got them all in my supplemental tool bar, I just don't know what to do. :sumo:</div></div><hr />

If you are fighting one I start of with demo roar, than maul till dead bash and heal as needed. If fighting more than one demo roar than swipe, bash and heal, but with multiple mobs you should do this around 50% life. If you are trying to tank for a group you will be fighting multiple mobs so use the swipe method as well as through in a taunt on one of the mob that is being attacked by the others whenever available. Hope this helps if anyone has a better strategy for bear plz fell free to correct me.</div></div><hr />

None really do much damage.  Bear is all about high ac, and just wearing the mob(s) / opponent down.  That said..<br />
<br />
Maul repeatedly when fighting single mobs.<br />
<br />
Swipe repeatedly, and occasionally maul on the main target when fighting lots of mobs.  They are on different timers, so you can literally maul then swipe immediatley afterwards.  Especially effective when you have the talent that generates rage when you crit in bear form.  Almost guaranteed to crit on one or the hits from maul.<br />
<br />
Bash when you need to heal, or if you know that you arent going to need to heal yourself during the fight, to interrupt spell casting.  Feral charge is great for interrupting spell casting as well.</div></div><hr />
