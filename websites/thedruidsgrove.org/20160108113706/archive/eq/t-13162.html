I'm guessing instances since there will be no competition for mobs. IE... 500 people trying to camp Fire/RSS. <br />
 <br />
Sunday is gonna be my day!!! I get off work tonight at midnight and GF has to be at work by 5am PST Sunday. Gonna sneak those hours for myself. Insanely hard instances would be out though I think, since I have beaten very few. Like the DoD spell missions, way too hard for the average Joe I pick up LFG. Although, 69.1 went pretty well kiting.<br />
 <br />
Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes taking forever to let you in, then lagging very bad while in. I am sure its because everyone is trying to do the same thing.<br />
 <br />
Popular sites seem to be the lower level dungeons like HHK and the Hole. I think that Droga and some of the LoY zones are still under utilized tho and might be a better idea.<br />

Just my 2 cps</div></div><hr />

I got on at 2am PST and got in a group in RSS right away. Kinda scared me, never get groups that fast. But, made 12 AA in 4 hours so far. Don't laugh, but that's the most AA I have ever made in one day let alone 4 hours. It's just sick.<br />
 <br />
Yeah, yeah... Someone's gonna follow-up post they get 10 AA per hour or some shizzle. I don't really care. This morning has been really fun. I got to meet some new people from the MT server that merged with us.</div></div><hr />

Group wasn't even that optimized...just a warrior, 2 druids, a mage, a shaman, and an enchanter. The lag spikes are server side, so the mobs aren't really attacking when the lag hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eldrynn</div><div class="date">01-22-2006, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah netty, rest of my morning's been in 69.1 Hard. It's great, but yes every once in a while we get a lag spike. I saved my lessons for here. Was a great idea, had an awesome kite group set up killing 3-4 mobs at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barklight</div><div class="date">01-22-2006, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I duo'd the undead Nest side for a few hours with a necro buddy lastnight, then buncha guildies and me tore through 4 Blackwings with 400% EXP (Lessons and old quest potion).  I got 42 AA's lastnight in a few hours :P  2 glossy drake hides and 3 metallic drake scales too $$$<br />
<br />
After raids tonight, I'm probably going to either recruit a group for some Hard Lost Notebook's (69.1 Hard) or do a bunch more blackwings for the loots hehe.  Either way ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treiz</div><div class="date">01-23-2006, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">69.1 hard is great. 5aa solo with lotd in 30 mins 33% per kill with double xp running. Did this again with a group for another lotd and hit 7 aa's in the 30 mins, 3 wizzies a mage and a bard. even without double xp 69.1 hard is seriously good xp and with the help of a guildie or 2 for 5 secounds getting one to solo is very easy. 32 aa's in about 8 1/2 hours playtime over the weekend.. fun fun fun</div></div><hr />

<br />
Level 64 to level 70 in a weekend.  It just doesn't get any better than that.  I even pulled off 3.5 AA's in the process hehehe.<br />
<br />
We need more of those weekends hehehe.</div></div><hr />

Woo hoo, gratz man!!! This weekend kinda sucked, too much RL stuff. But I did do a few 69.1's. Got my cleric thru 69 to 70 in 2 missions and quite a few AA's.</div></div><hr />

So actually 8 levels and 30 AA's.  Sounds much more impressive that way.. yeah, that's the ticket ;)<br />
