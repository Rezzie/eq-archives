Those are 9 right there that probably have half the average population. Might want to take that into account.</div></div><hr />

I would hate it I'm sure, but I think it would be best overall if they added several more servers and did force moves.  They could try to allow groups of friends, guilds, rl family to stay together if they wanted, but people would still end up separated.  I don't see them adding too many more servers, and especially not taking the chance of losing people by forcing them to move.  I do think as far as game play (crowding, lag and such) it would be better though.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I can only assume the original servers (sol ro, xeg, fennin?) and some of the more popular servers (mith marr, veeshan) break that now or come close while the zekkers keep fairly low, along with the euro servers, and stormhammer.<br />

<br />
2 guilds in plane of time. (both stage 4)<br />
1 guild starting to work on elemental gods.(killed fennin)<br />
1 guild just broke into elementals last week.<br />
A couple of ssra emp lvl guilds.<br />
<br />
So most people are lvl 65 in raiding guilds. with a litle mix of lower lvl chars working their way up to 65.<br />
<br />
If u love raiding this server is fantastic, but if u are more into doing exp groups, it can be somewhat hard to find a pick up group, since there is not much of them.</div></div><hr />

(like CT I would imagine cause they have like 12 guilds in EP )<br />
They are mostly US and old servers though. New and euro server ( Like Kane Bayle) have a small population rate and is a haven  for soloers/bots etc... <br />
<br />
Server is mixed with high levels to very new players. Kinda like Maelin and Venril server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SolRo got a &quot;hidden&quot; second serversplit when european servers went live. There was a very large german and a minor french community. The frenchies are almost all on their Sebilis Server and approx. 50% of the german population moved to Kael Drakkel Server (my guild suffered serverly on this).</div></div><hr />
