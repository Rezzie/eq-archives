Ok, I just don't know how Blizzard could design such funny and tasteless gears!  And don't get me started with the colors...it seems like a lot of the gears don't fit druids nicely in terms of style than mages and warriors.  I just wanna know how many are you are contented with your druids look stylewise.:tongue:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The early gear is absolutely HORRIBLE.  Tier 4 I really like the look of.  Teirs 5 and 6 well...</div></div><hr />

Speaking of tier sets...I've always been impressed with most the druid sets.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 (Cenarion) - Tbh I didn't really like it that much. Maybe because I was Tauren but I just didn't like the helm so much and I thought the rest of the set was just plain.<br />
<br />
Tier 2 (Stormrage) - One of my favorite tier sets. I really like the helm and shoulders especially.<br />
<br />
Tier 3 (Dreamwalker) - This tier set really took a turn in terms of design and feel. Nothing really nature about it but more like lightning or the 'greater' nature (if that made sense). It wasn't too bad though.<br />
<br />
Tier 4 (Malorne) - Really liked the set but it was our first tier set that had pants instead of a kilt so it looked out of place a bit at first but it seems fine now.<br />
<br />
Tier 5 (Nordrassil) - Similar to tier 4 but darker tones and the kilt again. I'm not sure if this was supposed to mean anything but the way I see it is that tier 4 is similar to a young tree whereas tier 5 is a great and matured tree (even the name Nordrassil which was the orignal world tree iirc)<br />
<br />
Tier 6 (Thunderheart) - Very totemish with a feel of Mulgore and the Tauren buildings. I think it's quite fitting but not so sure about why NElfs would wear it =/...Maybe their version shouldn't have the tribal feathers.</div></div><hr />

Hood of primal life, moonglade shoulders, and then lime green pants and boots.  Add in my mace and lamp of peaceful repose and there you have it.<br />
<br />
My feral gear is mostly rogue gear anyway - other than a staff.  So it looks just fine.<br />
<br />
I am actually hoping the expansion comes out in time for my night elf to skip the tier 6 set.  It looks great for the taurens though.  Tier 3 looked cool even though it didn't really scream 'druid' to me.</div></div><hr />

At around 25 or so I was starting to look kinda cool, but that disintegrated totally after level 30.  It took until 56 or so for the image to start improving again, and at 60 I looked like some kind of inbred warrior/rogue crossover.<br />
<br />
At 70 I look very....druidic :&gt;<br />

And you know, I understand the fanservicey scantily clad armor or whatever on other female characters but...why on Taurens?  I mean the developers really must be on some sort of crack to think that a cow in bikini armor is hot.  <br />

On the bright side, I'm glad I got a tabard and don't have to worry about such things for the moment.</div></div><hr />

Hehe. I just created another Tauren druid for the heck of it (I want the challenge of leveling it Resto. :P ), and I've already convinced myself I'm gonna be as priestly as possible and roll on cloth and whatnot for the sheer heck of it. :P<br />
 <br />
The best part is Cloth looks hilarious on male tauren. :P<br />
This'll be fun.</div></div><hr />

i guess pre bc i looked ok in the SR stuff.<br />

but now its a mix of everything i can get for best stats - esp in bear / kitty !<br />
<br />
tb hi dont mind  - its more about what the stats are than how i look !<br />

bit like a car colour choice - my wife would worry about the colour rather than make / model, engine size or if the alloys are big enough :p</div></div><hr />

From the looks of it the first picture is dps/pvp gear.<br />
Gloves are Gladiator's Dragonhide Gloves, shoulders Gladiator's Dragonhide Spaulders and dps pants from Netherspite, Skulker's Greaves, and the exalted Kurenai tabard.<br />

This is how Pookies looked last week (like a rogue with the shoulders from The Curator and the helm from Gruul).  I liked this outfit, except for those horrible Chess boots that make it look like I'm wearing leg warmers.<br />
<br />
I recently upgraded Pookies' shoulders to the badge shoulders which I think are ugly as hell ... but what can ya do, I wanted the stats and was sick of waiting for my tier stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the hell do the S2, S3/T5, T6 outfits have skirts? I HATE it... reminds me of the super duper hippies at Grateful Dead shows wearing the unisex stuff... I ended up breaking down and buying the S3 skirt yesterday because My 5v5 arena team has turned out to be pretty competetive, and i can use all the stats i can get... I really wanted to wait until S4 released and see what the Brutal Galdiator stuff looked like, but then heard a rumor that you need to have a personal rating to be able to get ANY S4 gear, so again, i'm gonna need all the stats i can get my big furry paws on...</div></div><hr />
