<br />
The overall impact of the patch is hard to understand, at least for me, at this point.  It seems to have hit the high end tanks much harder than the entry level tanks, so If we assume the standards haven't changed since 3.1 (not a great assumption), you should be shooting for:<br />
<br />
Entry Level heroics (Nx, UK, VH, CoH)<br />
25k Health (shifted)<br />
20k Armor+ (shifted)<br />
25-30% dodge (shifted)<br />
<br />
Harder Heroics:<br />
30k+ Health (shifted)<br />
25k+ Armor (shifted)<br />
30%-40% dodge (shifted)<br />
<br />
10 mans need about the same as the harder heroics.  A good goal to shoot for is all i187+ gear before 10 manning, and all i200+ stuff for 25 man.  <br />
<br />
I strongly reccomend avoiding Uldaur all together until you are in mostly i213.  (Blizzard claims i200 is adeqate for ulduar10, but I think they have over tuned the content abit at the moment for that)</div></div><hr />

Tho i think most of my blues/( couple epics) are around 200, no enchants on them tho.<br />
<br />
My name is Wickedly - US - Misha-- Heh i found out u could edit your location in the user options, i added my name and location and server to there for quicker reference from now on  :)<br />

Though, Right now i am in my healing gear, I will also have to respec to bear, is there a good bear spec to go for nowadays?</div></div><hr />

i don't know tho i feel weak i guess, havn't got a chance to try out my new spec though</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our guild requries folks to be at 1500 for Naxx 10 (not a hard rule, but a firm suggestion)<br />
<br />
With enchants and gems, you should be ready to start Naxx.  Don't expect to clear it, but certainly could handle spider and plague wings.<br />
<br />
Also, on your talent, you may want to get 2 points into &quot;Savage Fury&quot;.  It is a straight 10% buff to your damage which will help a lot in both forms.<br />
<br />
I would take points out of Infected Wounds or Furor.<br />
<br />
<br />
My gear is still showing my old Feral stuff atm, but I respec'd yesterday so, hopefully that will update soon.  I change to &quot;Resto&quot; to buff myself, so I don't put points in iMotW.  <br />

The people i play with usually will let me roll on offspec gear, i usaully don't run with a rogue so that's a plus for gear drops.<br />
<br />
When i get home this evening i will check your spec, and possibly respec the same as you and see how that rolls when i do get to tank my first heroic.<br />
<br />
My biggest dilema is i don't know how to enchant / gem for bear anymore.</div></div><hr />

You can toss a stam or hit enchant or gem in if agi doesn't work, but that should be your #1 go to when possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you know what your HP/Dodge/Armor are when shifted + Druid buffed?<br />
<br />
You look like you'll be ok for heroics, just from what I can see on the armory.  I personally like Primal Tenacity, since I seem to get stunned an awful lot.  I skimped on my resto talents for my feral spec to pick up KotJ and Savage fury.  RAWR.<br />
<br />
If I would have been thinking last night, I'd have logged out in one of my tanking sets and would have stayed shifted.  I can try to do that tonight.<br />
<br />
I found these articles to be quite helpful (even though I haven't grabbed these enchants yet...been focusing on resto more lately)<br />
<br />
For Feral Tank Enchants by Slot (courtesy of &quot;Of Teeth and Claws&quot;. (http://teethandclaws.blogspot.com/2008/12/feral-enchantments.html)<br />
<br />
For gems, it looks like you have 1 blue and 3 red slots on the gear that's on your armory as of today.  So, you could grab some Delicate Scarlet Rubies for your red slots- they give you +16 Agi each...Can't go wrong with a bit of dodge :)  <br />
<br />
For a cheaper alternative you could go with a Delicate Bloodstone.  They're incredibly affordable on our AH and give you +12 Agi.  Shifting Twilight Opals give you +8 Agi and +15 Stam.  That would be a nice choice also in balancing your stats, plus it's a purple gem, and can be used in Red or Blue :D YAY!<br />
<br />
If you're just lacking stam, maybe go with the blue gem, Solid Sky Sapphire.  +24 Stam is yummy if you're needing to boost your HP a bit.<br />
<br />
Once you get your HP and Dodge up where you want them to be, you can tinker around with other gems or enchants for more RAWR.<br />
<br />
If bears still work as they've worked in the past- which seems to be the case so far- You can't go wrong with Stam + Agi.  Crit is a beautiful thing now with the new Savage Defense.  The more AP you have the less likely you'll lose threat to an OP Fire Mage *sigh*.  <br />
<br />
Another note about King of the Jungle on the Feral Tree.  I got a little guff for picking that up, BUT...in my defense...I am rage starved quite a bit.  I find myself hitting Enrage whenever it's up.  The little buff from KotJ to my attack power helps me reign the mobs back in if I've lost them to the DPS during a rage-deprived moment.  Just throwing that out there.  So =P to the hunter that picked on me about it!<br />
<br />
Ooooh, and if you haven't already...go after Sons of Hodir rep.  They've got some really sexy shoulder enchants for both feral and resto.  It's an eternal grind, but very much worth it.</div></div><hr />

with how my gear is now i am...<br />
21k hp<br />
33% crit<br />
30 or so dodge<br />
25k armor ( i think)<br />
<br />
But i think i am shifted/feral spec'd when i logged out cause my stats on armory looks like my stats</div></div><hr />

I can sort of remember what my gear looked like when I got &quot;geared&quot; to run heroics.<br />
<br />
I had:<br />
Headguard of Retaliation  <br />
Trollwoven Spaulders  (Crafted)<br />
Eviscerator's Bindings  (BoE World Drop- AH)<br />
Trollwoven Girdle  (Crafted)<br />
Polar Vest (Crafted)<br />
Polar Boots  (Crafted)<br />
Durable Nerubhide Cape  (Crafted)<br />
<br />
I had the +75 Stam Alchemists stone and some other random trinket.  I also think I started with the Staff of the Sorrowful Chieftain as my tanking weapon tbh.  <br />
<br />
I replaced that weapon initially with the Enraged Feral Staff from H:UK and have slowly begun to replace the rest of my gear.  Badge grinding has been VERY slow for this druid, and the loot gods seem to hate me lately.  Even though Skwid yells at me almost daily- I don't have very many enchants on my gear.  Be thankful that it's gemmed.  I assumed I would be replacing it more quickly, but I'm finding that this is not the case, so I probably should grab some better enchants...</div></div><hr />

I'm an alchemist too!<br />
i didn't even think about that trinket!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">04-22-2009, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LoL!  Yeah switch out between the Indestructible Alchemist's Stone and The Mighty Alchemist's Stone depending on the fight.  If I need the AP boost more than the stam boost, I go with Mighty for some extra rawr. <br />
<br />
You learn it at Skill lvl 400 Alchemy, I believe.<br />
<br />
There's a trinket that drops in H:Azjol Nerub that I've yet to get my hands on, since I can't seem to get a group that gets past the first room *sigh* -_- <br />
<br />
I used Big Bear Butt's list (http://thebigbearbutt.com/2009/01/05/bear-tanking-specs-and-gear-pre-naxx/) to start getting geared for heroics, and a lot of that gear is still viable in Naxx for tanking.  I passed up on the Eviscerator's Facemask because, let's face it- the Headguard of Retaliation is just...better.<br />
<br />
Though, The Shroud of Darkness (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43403) drops from that EVIL EVIL Voidwalker Boss in H:VH- and that gave me an unbelievable stam boost with the gems I slapped in there.  Like, RAWR BABY!  With that boost, I can look for more Agility/AP/etc for a lil more grr for my bear, and I imagine still very easily survive about any encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
with an imba healer it helps to make up for any deficiencies in your gear and with great dps mobs die much quicker giving the healer an easier time.<br />
<br />
i know that if we run heroics with some people i know we are assured of a fast, virtually faultess run through the likes of AN/AK/UK/HoL/HoS and even VH depending upon bosses.<br />
<br />
if we end up pugging a few people then you're never sure.</div></div><hr />

when i started running Naxx25 as feral dps, my only epic was the Staff of Trickery from hVH (which i JUST happened to replace last night with The Undeath Bringer wewt!)<br />
<br />
now that i'm trying to gear up for Bear as my 2nd spec, im having a hell of a time going back through heroics... It looks like i'll be running hDTK for the tanking ring until my eyes bleed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did get very lucky in Naxx (10-man) as I got both staffs in back to back runs (but it took us 4+ runs to even make it to the DDR boss).  And my helm on the 3rd run.  Still haven't gotten my T7 pants.<br />
<br />
Uldar hasn't been to kind to us so far.  I think it really exposes those that &quot;know their class&quot; and those that don't.  In 10-man Naxx you could carry 2-3 so-so players if you had at least one good tank and a couple of healers.  Not sure that can happen in Uldar, even after the &quot;nerfs&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Or, opening 300+ Brightly Colored Eggs last night and no pet, no tux pieces.  Just a few dresses, some blossoming branches and a handful of circlets.  Oi!

The skirmisher's random charge and the fact that you can't taunt them makes life miserable, so people just give up.  I've learned a BUNCH of strategies for dealing with that random charge through reading about the encounter, but to actually get a PuG to listen...well...it seems to be an impossibility.<br />
<br />
For H:OK, I've never seen it on either regular or heroic.  It's one of those heroics people on my server just don't seem to want to do at all.  <br />
<br />
I don't think either are exceptionally difficult as long as the group is decently geared, putting out the DPS needed, and able to cooperate.  So, I'm with you Khel.  I don't like to PuG because of the stress it causes.  Frustrated with the inability to get through either of those instances, I've given to working on alts for a bit.  It's more relaxing than wiping multiple times on a heroic with a PuG that just won't listen...</div></div><hr />

OcculusNo CoS?  That has to be one of the easier heroics, too.  When I first reached lvl 80, it was, by far, the most popular heroic I ran.  At least, until, all the casters realized they wanted that damn mace out of hNexus.<br />
<br />
With the new bear swipe, it has to be quite a bit easier.  I still haven't completed AK (or Old Kingdom whatever it is called).  I just ran Occulus (pug) on regular 2 weeks ago and then last week I ran it on heroic (pug).  It is no where near as difficult as it is made out to be (HoS computer event is still the hardest heroic &quot;boss&quot; IMO).  The final boss fight (vehicle fight) is stupid easy if everyone is on the same page and knows their role.<br />
<br />
I think folks avoid AK so much because, it has an insane amount of trash.  And the last boss makes you PvP, which many folks don't like and/or don't know how to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bear swipe is awesome here.  I was able to make a timed run with a very &quot;young&quot; group the other day.  To give you an idea how low our DPS was, I ended up on top of the meters as the tank with about 2.3k DPS.  (and no, I am up to 13 successful H-CoS timed runs, on three different toons, and no drake  :(  )<br />

I also ran it with my Frost/Fire mage who just dinged 80 this week and was able to make the timer.  (Frostfire = OP AoE though, was pulling threat off a full Valorous Pally, hitting undead!)</div></div><hr />

I just stood still and spammed swipe 3-4 times before I started to focus on a particular clone.  Never lost agro.  Pre-3.1 that was a very annoying fight for bears.  You just have to remember to not allow your rage to drop just before she splits.  Otherwise you can't even swipe.<br />
<br />
We don't raid on the weekends, so I might give a couple 5-mans a try this weekend.  Ought to be fun.  Maybe I'll finally get to do AN: AK -- OK...lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cos seems to be easy, but i cannot get a grp together usually that the healer will stay up with me. so that wipes us.<br />
<br />
AN seems to be the hardest for my groups, i guess people just are scared to do it. Because when i run AN and am healing , i have no problems with it, but when i am tanking,  Gosh i don't know i guess it's cause i don't have a healer usually that can remove poisons.</div></div><hr />

The PvP boss is the one I've never gotten past (no one could kill the healer).  Maybe there is a trick to the fight that I'm not aware of, but, then I doubt ill ever see it so does it mater???</div></div><hr />

TLB I've heard the same thing, that it ends up being the healer that's impossible.  What if you had your healer change spec or gear or some such thing before entering that battle?  There's got to be some crazy strategy for it that'll get the mirrored healer down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Best strat is to ignore all others until the healer is dead.  They have relatively low HP and can be stunned/silenced/crit bombed...etc.  Once you have killed all your NPC's you can help other folks kill theirs.  So the trick is to have your Uber DPSers dominate their NPCs and then help the healer and tank kill off theirs.<br />
<br />
The tank generally doesn't put out enough burst damage (unless a skilled hybrid ;) ) and the Healer suffers the same fate.  So your tank just takes it like a man and hopes he/she survives long enough for help to arrive, and the healer just spam heals themselves.   <br />
*When I am tanking, I start with a charge on the healer for a quick interupt, then mangle/maul/lacerate, Bash, for another interupt and Mangle/maul again.  Almost always kills them unless they got lots of hots up...darn Resto's.  <br />
Everyone /target healer as soon as their ads are down and kill em!</div></div><hr />

Now that i am down to 40 gold , I'm gonna need enchants LOL<br />
<br />
Had the same problems for a long time.<br />
Then i decided to buy gold. (I wanted to play in the time i was online and not worry about every little silver i spend).<br />
But the prices are ridicoulos high. 5000g about ~&#8364;50,-<br />
<br />
So i bought an account for &#8364;120,- with over 40k gold on it.<br />
No worries here anymore for a long time. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
But i don't really condone buying gold, Though it might just be because i don't want my account to get banned.  Can't they still track that?</div></div><hr />

A friend of mine did and it caused some issues for him.  He'd gotten gkicked because the GM found out he bought gold.  (Guess it doesn't pay to brag about how much gold you have after spending the night before whining about how much you still need...)  His account was hacked and he ended up having to cancel his credit card.  Definitely not my cup of tea.  <br />
<br />
Serg, in USD, you spent over $160 for 40k gold.  I can't imagine paying so much extra, on top of the two account fees every month (I pay for my mother's acct too), for gold I could farm in game for &quot;free&quot;.  I understand why folks do it, believe me, I do.  After watching my friend suffer, I doubt I'd ever do it.</div></div><hr />

But things in my life changed and i just dont have the time to farm for hours a day anymore.<br />
I'm glad i can squeeze in the time for raiding 3-4 times a week.<br />
<br />
@Des<br />
Yep. The money part was a big question too for me.<br />
But I'm not paying for 2 accounts and if i think about what time i spend ingame, other hobbies are far more expensive.<br />
It's like buying new shoes for playing soccer. :-)<br />
And this is a one-time-investement. Cause this gold will last through my whole WoW-Life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I agree.  Other hobbies can be much more expensive.  I don't hate on the folks that do it.  I just don't know if it's something I'd ever do.<br />

Can't you get banned for buying gold or accounts with gold on them?  That would be my biggest fear.</div></div><hr />

Don't think that it's illegal. I pay a person for the time of leveling a char to 80 and farming gold. It is nothing that offends blizzard.<br />
<br />
And blizzard doesn't know which &quot;char&quot; bought an account.<br />
They would have to look at the money-flow of the mail-system or AH to find the big money-transfers. Don't think this is happening! :shuffle: <br />

But, its also in Blizzard/Activisions best interest to look the other way.  Gold farmers and power levelers are paying WoW $15 a month per account to do their business.<br />
<br />
It violates the EULA because you are technically having an unfair advatage over other players and having multiple adults using one account (Husbands and Wives violate this all the time).  <br />
<br />
I have never bought gold, but did have an RL friend /quit WoW, and give me his gold.  It wasn't a ton (~2k ish), but really still violates the EULA in the same way.  It was somthing I didn't earn, that was given to me, thus giving me an advantage over other people.<br />

Very gray area!</div></div><hr />

They have this entire essay on why it's bad for the in-game economy, but they don't specifically state that buying gold is forbidden. <br />
<br />
And, Solar, on my horde server, I was &quot;lucky&quot; enough to have had a friend that was quitting the game &quot;for good&quot;, and he dropped about 8k gold onto my B.Elf paladin.   There's nothing illegal about transferring gold between toons like that (We asked a GM to be absolutely Certain).  I don't have the gold anymore.  He returned a short while later and I mailed his gold back to him, happily, I might add.  <br />

That tends to be more of a drama avoidance tactic than anything else.</div></div><hr />

That was OK (Old Kingdom) if you kill the last boss within 20 mins of killing the first group of spiders you complete a daily.  So you can skip 3 of the 5 bosses if you'd like.  Just have to kill the bubble boy and the final boss (takes about 10 mins).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
i also got a total counting the helm  of either 3 or 4 tier drops( I'll edit the post as soon as i get home to which ones i got exactly.)<br />
<br />
The whole 25 man run only took 4 hours,<br />
What was cool is i was asked to heal it, So they let me main set roll for feral gear.<br />
<br />
Not sure if i will use the tier gear for healing or tanking yet. But obvious to say, i  have 226 Heroisms i have not used yet(havn't used any yet) So i can def buy some of the buyable tier gear to go with that i got.</div></div><hr />

You're a bear to be reckoned with!<br />
<br />
Me personally...it'd go toward tanking stuff...but that's only because healing makes me want to shadowmeld...a lot...</div></div><hr />

I recently grouped with a bear on server who had 30k+ HP in CASTER FORM...unshifted...30k HP and change...<br />
<br />
O.O<br />
<br />
How in the world do you get THAT much HP in Caster form???  Shifted and unbuffed I only have 31-32k-ish HP.  I've tried to find him on the armory, but it looks like he logs out in kitty gear.  I can't tell if he's just stacking pure stam or if he's actually got a decent amount of dodge there.  Is this possible?  I'm confused.  Maybe I should stop hiding behind my leaves and figure out how to be a big bad bear again too...</div></div><hr />

<br />
you mean just standing there not in any form ?<br />
<br />
i'm sure that's possible if you have got high end gear and gemmed and enchanted for stam.<br />
<br />
i seem to remember people talking about 45k shifted and some buffs ?  so i would guess 30k not shifted is doable ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish he'd log out in that gear so I could see what it is and how much dodge he has, etc.  I'd strive for that.  10 man raid buffed he was well over 40kHP.  I can't even imagine what he'd be like in a 25 or 40 man raid lol<br />
<br />
Unshifted, in my heavy stam set I am around 20-24K HP.  I just can't seem to find my balance in bear form anymore.  I should stop resto-ing and get back to my feral roots so I can figure this out...</div></div><hr />

I am far from BiS and have several pieces that I share between my cat and bear sets and I am at around 27k in caster form. In my stam set I break 30k in caster easily.</div></div><hr />

Is it mostly Ulduar gear now?  It's been so long since I've played my bear that I don't even know what I'm looking for anymore =(</div></div><hr />
