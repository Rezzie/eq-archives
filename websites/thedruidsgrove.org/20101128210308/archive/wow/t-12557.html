<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aral</div><div class="date">04-21-2008, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok here is the summary:<br />
Bosses have a 5.6% chance to crit you.<br />
If you have Survival of the Fittest talent, you have negated 3%.<br />
5.6-3.0=2.6<br />
This means that you need to have -2.6% chance to get critically hit using resilience or defense, or the combination of both.<br />
Now go to your defense tab, mouse over defense, write down that number. Now mouse over resilience, write down that number.<br />
Add those 2 numbers.<br />
If the summary is exactly or more than 2.6% you are uncrittable, if it is over 2.6% you can loose some defense or resilience, if it is under 2.6% you aren't uncritable and should get more defense/resilience.<br />
This works only for melee attacks, since spells from bosses and mobs cant crit.<br />
About uncrushable:<br />
Druids CAN NOT become uncrushable permanently with the current gear available, because it requires 102.4% avoidance (dodge only for druids). You can however become uncrushable for a short period of time using trinkets and various other raid buffs. I hope that has made it clear to you.<br />
I apologize about the spelling errors, english is not my mothertongue and i have a serious headache at the moment. :)</div></div><hr />

I say lazy only in regards to seeing if you are uncritable and don't want to do the math. The site is actually a great little tool to get a snapshot overview of your (or someone else's) toon.....especially when you are at work..I mean...uhh what were we talking about again? The downside is it is based on your armory snapshot which is only updated when you log out. People tend not to log out in their fight'n gear.<br />
