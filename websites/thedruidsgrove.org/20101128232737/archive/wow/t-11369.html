<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackehorn</div><div class="date">12-12-2006, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that I hit 12700 AC unbuffed last night and it was an upgrade from when I looked at it last.  Then I saw that my Furors Eyepatch was now at an AC of 183 instead of 160 and my Mantle of Wicked revenge was 195 instead of 170.   Am I crazy or were these upgraded the last patch? And the Elementium Threaded cloak is up 8 AC .. not that I am complaining =))</div></div><hr />

If this is indeed true, we are going to get bear tanks with 15k ac and up very easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-15-2006, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, they upped the AC values on many items.  Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark got a significant boost as well.  I believe it was a straight percentage on armor only.  This mean that your lovely Staff of Jordan has the same boring AC as before. . . <br />
<br />
But I will say one thing about the new buffs to AC.  I ride at about 12k with 23-25% dodge depending on the boss fight.  I could easily go higher with AC, but I find that, in terms of overall damage mitigation, dodge becomes more effective once AC &gt; 10k.  Also don't forget that you need hefty stamina to pull off some of the higher end bosses (particularly those bosses with hard-hitting magic).  So the one thing I'll say (took me long enough, right?) is that I am now switching away from AC heavy gear to slightly lower AC and major stat improvements in either the area(s) of agility and/or stamina.</div></div><hr />
