For example i plan on mixing with:<br />
Defiler's Leather Shoulders<br />
298 armor<br />
17 stm<br />
18 str<br />
+ xx atk power<br />
<br />
Any more good options you think ..........?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

It's really a no-brainer given the defiler set is more mana, AP, dodge, AC and spell crit.  The HP's balance out and iirc the only advantage for the PvP set is a bit more +heal/spell damage.</div></div><hr />

unless he screws up. Trap, aimed-shot, Trap, aimed-shot, etc. If a hunter is standing on his trap, only pure luck can keep you from <br />
being frozen as soon as you enter melee range. And if you do manage do avoid one trap, then it's feign, trap, bandage, aimed-shot. And if you avoid that trap aswell, he throws a scatter-shot at you, and you wander mindlessly into his trap.<br />
Luckily, most hunters don't know this, they sometimes don't even remember to put up more then one trap, and complain about how overpowered druids are... And in PvP this tactic is only useable when it comes to defending.</div></div><hr />
