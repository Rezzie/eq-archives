***********************************************<br />
<br />
I love Warriors!<br />
<br />
Around level 48 - I PuG'd with a talented Warrior and we have leveled at the same rate since.  When we join up for quests, we pretty much own the scene.  A little HoT here and there, and we're good to go!</div></div><hr />

Excellent survivablity.  2nd to none at solo questing.  Huge end-game PvE DPS.  But, most suck, so many folks think they all suck which can make very difficult time at getting a spot in 5-mans and raids.<br />
<br />
I've heard they are pathetic in arenas but I don't do PvP so that's never been an issue.<br />
<br />
As I level my Druid, I get into situations that I know would be 100% easier with my hunter which makes Druid leveling a bit frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">08-21-2007, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya, personally, I quite enjoy running dungeons with Hunters.  I love pets, and as far as I'm concerned, a pet that needs my healing is doing a great job.  <br />
<br />
I've only had one bad experience with a pet.  I was healing Deadmines with my Level 21 Priest, and we had just cleared a particularly grueling mob.  I sat to re-gen my mana, when I noticed that the wolf just kept howling and running forward into a rather far away mob.  :eek: IRL I gasped and yelled &quot;Doggy Noooooooo!  Bad Dog!&quot;  :thumbsup:   He didn't hear me (for some reason :p ) and needless to say, we wiped.  I was completely useless with no mana.<br />
<br />
The party was very angry with the poor hunter (level 20), and he kept saying that he couldn't control his pet yet.  Is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">08-21-2007, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Odds are better he didn't know how to control his pet.  They don't hand out manuals and most people wipe a party at least once with bad pet management.  When I'm tanking any instance below 60, I always start out with two rules....<br />
1.  Make sure your pet is on passive.<br />
2.  Turn off Growl damn it!!!!<br />
<br />
For anything post 60, I assume you know what your doing.  However I always end up yelling at the warlocks to turn off their damned cleave on their Felguard....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">08-21-2007, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.  Make sure your pet is on passive.<br />
2.  Turn off Growl damn it!!!!Very very true.  I've met plenty of hunters that leave Growl on (you don't want your pet to gain agro most of the time in an instance) and/or have defensive or (gasp!) aggressive stances turned on.<br />
<br />
Frankly, even while questing every hunter should leave their pet on passive.  Only those rare times when you have to deal with multiple mobs at once (3+) is defensive a good idea.  Aggressive is just plan useless (and dangerous) except when you are a lvl 70 taking a group thru WC or RFD, etc.<br />
<br />
Pet management is easy.  Even more so now that Mend Pet is a HoT rather than a channeled spell.  There are a few (2-3) end-game bosses that can be pet unfriendly, but that's it.</div></div><hr />

Although some duos may benefit or synergize with each other a bit better, every class I've played with leveling up had me thinking &quot;wow this is a really good combination&quot; with the exception of paladins (because there were no horde pallys at my growing up time =3)</div></div><hr />

Useable during combat?<br />
<br />
I have two characters, my main Druid and my alt Priest.  I couldn't imagine playing a non-healer, so I honestly know nothing outside of my two characters.<br />
<br />
So...can hunters can heal their pets during combat?  This is major &quot;main healing&quot; knowledge for me.  I do my best to keep all pets alive during combat (the party comes first, of course).  But, pet or party member, I hate to lose anyone on my watch.<br />
<br />
So, all the times I've apologised to hunters for losing their pet, please tell me that there was a darned good reason as to why they weren't healing them themselves.  Other than, of course, the obvious fact that I was doing it for them due to my own stupidity.</div></div><hr />

Useable during combat?Yes and yes.  It use to be a 10 second channel spell which made it worthless, but in 2.1(?) it became a HoT.<br />
<br />
Speaking from a hunter's PoV, if a healer has the mana (trash fight, short boss fight) I see no reason why the healer can't spare a bit of healing on my pet.  However, I always expect my pet to be the least important player to get heals.<br />
<br />
In a RAID where there are typically plenty of healers to go around, there is no reason not to throw a heal at a pet.  Unless of course the hunter is stupid and trying to tank something with his pet.<br />
<br />
In instances the pet should be considered a DoT from the hunter's PoV that does 380+ DPS (assuming BM spec'd).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">08-21-2007, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hunters are a surprisingly complex class when played 'correctly', or more accurately, to their full potential.  As a hunter I have many times gotten so tied up watching my shot rotation, trap cooldowns, watching for mobs breaking for the healers, etc that I forget to Mend my pet.  I don't get upset if the healer doesn't heal it and it dies, because, after all, it's primarily my responsibility.  <br />
But if I've been conscientious about keeping the HoT ticking and not it's not keeping up with incoming damage, you bet I appreciate the heals heading that way.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, as a healer -priest and druid- I will always make an effort to at least keep a HoT up on a pet who's taking damage, so long as I have the mana to spare, and especially when the hunter has been good about covering my arse if I get aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly.  I agree wholeheartedly.  And, although I now know that hunters can heal their pets, it's not going affect my healing methods at all.  If I have taken on the role of healer, I am going to heal EVERYTHING that needs healing if it's within my power.<br />
<br />
It's nice to see different points of view from other classes.<br />
<br />
THAT being said, I still love questing with my Warrior buddy, because, not only is he big and strong, but he's also quite dashing!  :grin:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Levelling from 60 to 70 in Outland we both got xp faster when grouped than when soloing (this wasn't a surprise for me - as a resto druid I don't solo fast - but it was a surprise for him).<br />

The pet tanks, I heal, and the warlock makes things dead quickly :)<br />

Though, recently a friend of mine made a druid, so I made a warrior to level with her. We go pretty fast, with me tanking/DPSing and her DPSing/healing. I'd say a rogue or warrior would complement a feral very well.</div></div><hr />

We both heal when we crit due to ImpLotP, so I don't normally have to shift out and heal. If there are multiple mobs or adds, I go bear and tank.

Ya, I like to run with Rogues.  They are quite handy in an Instance (Stun Rocks).  Rogues, for some reason on my server, have a bad reputation, but I, for one, have met some great ones.</div></div><hr />

The lesser geared druid goes bear form and does mangle and taunt, so the well-geared druid can go cat form and spam shreds.<br />

If I were resto, my class of choice to grind with would be an affliction warlock.<br />

Every mob is down before Pounce-Stun wears off.<br />
Pounce-&gt;Mangle-&gt;Shred / Stormstrike, Windfury, Frost/Earthshock  B&#196;HM.<br />
And both healers so biggest survivability.<br />
<br />
We did the Oggrilla event in strangle together, when we where jumped by a shami 2 lvls above us. Bear form, Challenging Roar(for the gorillas focusing on me) and we nuked him down pretty quick. Then continued killing the gorillas.<br />

It's a blast i tell u!</div></div><hr />
