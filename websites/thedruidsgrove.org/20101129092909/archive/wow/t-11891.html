<br />
I find that if I go to the AH and place, say, Fadeleaf up for auction, the AH suggested price isn't even close to what other players are asking for it.....plus.....the player asking prices vary so much.</div></div><hr />

That said, those are world wide averages.  The prices on your server could be dramatically different.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest getting Auctioneer and/or Gatherer addons.  Scan the AH 2-3 times a week for a couple of weeks.  And then maybe once a week after that.  Auctioneer will give you suggested prices based on information gathered from previous scans.<br />
<br />
If you are serious about making money on the AH, I'd make an alt and run it to the closest AH (any lvl 1 character can make it to their local AH).  Auctioneer data is shared between all characters (of the same faction) on the same server.  So, have this alt perform all of the scanning.</div></div><hr />
