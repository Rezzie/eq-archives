Ive recently joined a high end raiding guild (anguish) and wondered if anyone could give me a little advice on what items to look out for.  Here is my magelo:<br />

<br />
The three really weak items are gloves, back and waist so i could do with upgrading those first i think.  Also you will see that i have no spell haste so that is a priority.<br />
<br />
I dont imagine i will get my hands on any anguish gear for quite a while, as it will take time to build up DKP and therefore items from other zones would be a better choice that arent so high DKP, so i can get some decent quick upgrades.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />

could give me a little advice on what items to look out for<br />
 <br />
&quot;The LA Lakers recently signed a player who had a few problems in the locker room.  Apparently, he wasn't very knowledgable about basketball equpitment and appareal and he put on a baseball uniform by mistake.  Since the NBA assumes the players already know the basics about basketball equpitment and appareal they have never done anything in the past to prevent such things from occuring, but since than they added uniform advisers in all the locker rooms.  The rookie Laker could never be more happy!<br />

Sorry I couldn't resist....<br />
 <br />
But as for a serious responce to your question, this is not the right place to ask it - simply because we can't guess what you can and will kill and what kind of loot you are capible of winning.<br />
 <br />
I recommend you do the following:<br />
-Find out the priority of raid targets of your new guild<br />
-Find out what items drop from those raids, via a loot page<br />
-Find out the competition within in your guild for each paticular item you desire</div></div><hr />

 <br />
You have mentioned the missing focuseffekts yourself :)<br />
 <br />
For upgrades have a look at http://www.cardplace.com/eq/config/ there you can wight the stats you are in need of.<br />
 <br />
Don't try to get the best items for evrey slot, as you said these items are expensive, you will get more benefit from 2 or 3 lesser items.<br />
 <br />
you did not said anything where your new guild is raiding besides CoA but i guess there are targets where loot begins rotting or become cheap this will your chance. And always have a look to the lower end of your gear in hp/mana terms.<br />
 <br />
If you don't like number crunching, just earn a DKPpool and buy what looks pretty to you. If your guild is high end there will be no really bad drops anymore ;)</div></div><hr />
