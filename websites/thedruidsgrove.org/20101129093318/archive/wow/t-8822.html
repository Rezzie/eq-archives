<br />
After recently creating a new NE druid I decided that I wanted to make an enchanter, as I have not played one before. I know enchanting is expensive, and to that end I took skinning as a second profession. This seems to be working out ok, but I am wondering whether skinning is the best money making profession. <br />
<br />
What are other druid's experiences at making cash? Do herbalists / miners have better or worse cash flow? My previous character was a paladin, and as I got a free mount and was mining / blacksmithing I didn't really pay any attention to cash, blowing it at the AH whenever I got my hands on some gold. This time I need to have better financial control so that I can buy my kitty at 40 and feed the enchanting habit I have developed.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else working on enchanting and if so can you recommend strategies for developing wealth? Having not played for a few months I am not currently in a guild but plan on finding one when I am a little more established.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input!</div></div><hr />

i just started playin WoW a few weeks ago. My druid started out as a skinner/leatherworker. then i said&quot;what the hell&quot; and made jim an enchanter. i found enchanting was very expensive but the best place for the green items you need is the VC instance in the deadmines. thats just what ive found since ive been playon WoW.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

However, at later levels it really pays off.  If I were you, I would take herbalism and skinning or mining and skinning till about 40.  Then you can buy your mount and drop one or the other for enchanting.<br />
<br />
Enchanting is a LOT easier to raise at higher levels than at lower levels.  All you have to do is go back and farm a lowbie instance a couple of times and you should have enough items to get you to 100'ish.  Then, just move up the scale of dungeon or dis stuff as  you come across it.  Word of advice though, weapons usually sell good enough that you shouldn't dis them.  Everything else is up for grabs.<br />
<br />
I know this is similar to the advice most people give but I have done it both ways and can attest to the validity of it.  It took less than a week (levels 40-43) for my druid to get to the same level of enchanting as my guy that had started enchanting at level 6.</div></div><hr />

The one thing I will say about gathering professions is to look at the trends on your server.  Are there more LW'ers or smiths?<br />
<br />
There other thing about skinning, its nice to have all those monsters you have to kill anyways, but to be honest I never found mining/herb any harder.  A lot of ppl complain about having to find the spots but if you use your search skills its not hard at all.  And at lvl 30 we get travel form which gives a nice run boost for your scavenging.  <br />
<br />
There is a down for skinning.  While druids have great survivability, it takes us a short mellinium to kill stuff.  So it does take quite a while to fill up your stacks of skin without help the higher you go if you are trying to skin animals of near equal level to you.  <br />
<br />
If you take do take skinning, I recommend going to a place with lots of beasts and lots of levelers questing or grinding off em.  For example around lvl 40 (thinking of your first mount) you can got to the beach east of Aerie Peak, Hinterlands.  Skin all those level 50 turtles that get left behind; the only one that is agro is the elite.  Another area is Tanaris.  Lots of good skin out there too, mingle around the ppl coming to and from ZF.  Or you can try my all time favorite, Feralas.  Those yeti in Feral Scar Cave area or north of there in Feral Scar Hold are great skins.  Just go to one of those spots and ask if anyone is questing/grinding off mobs that can be skinned and if they are leaving them behind.  They will always say yes if they aren't skinning themselves.  Plus it helps them since you keep the respawn rate going and you can follow them around throwing heals to keep their leveling going.</div></div><hr />

Only the enourmous time and resources I had invested in it kept me from not starting over (and my alt enchanter)  Now I've been 60 for a fair while.  I have some really nice gear and now, just about every pattern available (minus still a few)  I can and am making solid money now on selling leather and my server pays &quot;fair&quot; for devilsaur, warbear, and ironfeather so finally, the tradeskill is &quot;starting&quot; to pay off.  Generally farming with my druid is solid.  Some say it's painfully slow, but I disagree.  It is extremely uneventful and I can do things no other class seems to be able to.  I consistently solo all devilsaur other than the tyrant and the king (tyrants fear and the add potential is usually to great) I consisently solo the stone guardians for the guardian stone (worth solid bux for people looking for the fixins for the cloak of warding)<br />
<br />
In regards to general farming, I still have OoC and am very happy with my talent build.  I can non stop farm the dinos in un'goro without ever stopping to rest.  I actually pay very little attention when doing this, reading or accomplishing some other task at my desk while listening for my OoC proc.  (this is generally done with my hammer of vesper and fiery enchant, along with imperial scepter)<br />
<br />
I can take out approx a dino a minute in this fashion, more so if I get a little bored and hit a spot where I can easily tag 4-6 dinos, then I just hit eranikus and drop to bear, let them kill themselves.  That requires more attention though LOL, so usually it's just one or two.<br />
<br />
So, my point is, if you went skin/leather, dont' get upset to early, give it some time and it can well turn into a trade skill that can be profitable.</div></div><hr />

Through the ups and downs the prices for various metals and flowers may vary, but they'll usually be a pretty good constant.  Also, don't count out fishing.  Diviate Fish, Oily Blackmouth, and Stonescale Eel all bring in some nice change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">06-21-2005, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Best money in the game:<br />
<br />
Mining and Enchanting<br />
<br />
In both cases, just sell what you gather.  Nice thing about Enchanting is you can have a skill of 1 and still disenchant epic gear.  Sellling shards, essences, and dust in the AH is quite profitable. On the mining side, 1 stack (20) of copper bars goes for about 1g in AH on my server.<br />
<br />
That said, it's fun to be able to make things in-game.  The only tradeskill I absolutely hate so far is smithing.  While it may be slightly less expensive to skill up than enchanting, it is the most difficult to do so - due to the massive amounts of materials required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Key Herbs:<br />
<br />
Swifthistle (for Rogue energy drink) - can be harvested with skill around 50-60<br />
Stranglekelp - skill around 50 again<br />
<br />
Mid - level herbs are common / easy to get - not much money there.  Higher level ones are:<br />
<br />
Ghost Mushroom<br />
Gromsblood<br />
Mountain Silversage<br />
Icecap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roguenoir</div><div class="date">10-14-2005, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stonescale Eels really pull in the gold if you're in your late 30's and are saving up for a mount.  On average, it takes you about 5 minutes to catch one and they should sell for about 50s each (conservative estimate).  However, at lvl 55, I can make more money by just grinding, not to mention the green and blue drops.<br />
<br />
People would much rather be spending their time doing something useful like instancing, raiding, leveling, etc than gathering materials.  If you are willing to put in the time to gather the materials yourself, you will be compensated if others need the materials.  Higher level players have more money.  So if you can gathering something that is needed in high quantities by a respectable number of high level players, you'll rack in the $$$.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya.. dreamfoil, golden sansam, groomsblood and mountain silversage are all worth stopping to collect imo. They are all highly valued on my server.<br />
<br />
I would say mining is the best money maker thou. Enchanting second and herbalism third.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cenaurius</div><div class="date">10-24-2005, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i sold stormshroud armor and volcanic armor to pay for my epic mount, typically making 10-20g in terms of profit per item.  i would imagine other professions can make money more quickly, but i had a huge supply of leather and access to essences on the AH, so it was an easy way to make gold when i stopped into IF.  the best way to make money in WoW is a thing i like to call &quot;roguesploitation.&quot;  if you have an item that rogues want, you can be sure some of them will pay top dollar for it.</div></div><hr />
