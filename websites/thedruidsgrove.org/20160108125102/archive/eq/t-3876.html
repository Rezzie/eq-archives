I am one component away from many of the pieces -- sleeves and Mask are the next pieces within reach. I will post more as information becomes available.</div></div><hr />

The sleeves appeared as newbie leather (on my Half Elf )with a *very* light smoky brown tint -- just enough to see there is a tint, but not really enough to change the actual color.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sucky in my opinion. I will keep it in the bank in case these are (as the rumour goes) the first step in a more involved quest. <br />
<br />
IMHO, they should drop the DEX/STA modifiers and add another +WIS or two.</div></div><hr />

Compare the time it would take to gather all the crap for say, the cloak, and you could have camped a molten or mammy. Or leveled high enough to do so.<br />
<br />
I dont think many people are gonna be doing these quests unless verant adds spell effects or doubles the stats. :(</div></div><hr />

This is mid level armor - which now is +39 and its better then when my character was growing up - all we had was BCP then Verm once planes opened. ( yes we talking pre-kunark).<br />
<br />
Good luck completing the quest and congrats to those that already have. - <br />

As for being worth or not worth it - My thoughts are screaming &quot;My arn't we spoiled&quot; if you get my meaning.</div></div><hr />

These quest arn't worth the trouble for how long and random the mobs are if you arn't going to wear them or give them to a friend - Might as well hit seb for a few hours and come out with a Fungie :P<br />

BTW Sobe, this is also better than what my druid had growing up :p BUT, better equipment is more easily obtained elsewhere, so it makes the stats on these quest items disapointing.</div></div><hr />

Not too bad. Granted you could go for PBB and get +5 WIS, but still...<br />
<br />
<br />
I have (kinda) completed the Earth Blessed Crook. I ended up using the astral jewel on the bracer, so I am getting another one from a guildie. I will post again hopefully late this evening.<br />
<br />
I really haven't been taking that much of a break.. it's just SO hard to get the things to spawn. The best chance I have is to wait until patch day and see what spawns when the servers come back up.<br />
<br />
I am STILL one piece away from finishing off the suit. I've sown the seeds of greed for the tunic piece, so just waiting to reap. :) I don't think offering 1K for what will become an +8 wis tunic is too bad.... :P</div></div><hr />

... you know, this would be an AWESOME item if it was 1hb instead of two. <br />

I have that.. but i believe this is just mis-information.<br />
<br />
am i in the right place? is the guard rare? hmmm if this is the way it is, i may just opt for getting an acrylia reinforced/studded tunic, unless this has some special look to it. can anyone post a pic of the tunic? i haven't seen one yet. that unfortunatelly may be the determining factor in my decision.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help</div></div><hr />

The guard (drops piece for tunic) spawns in a static spot. <br />
<br />
After zoning into Teneb, take a left right after you pass the guards and hug the wall until you see a gnome. Now, right in front of you (but ahead a good bit) is a camp of vamps. The PH for the guard is the closet vamp to you. Keep killing that one and you should see the guard. Be sure to have see invis up, because they tend to go incognito :). <br />
