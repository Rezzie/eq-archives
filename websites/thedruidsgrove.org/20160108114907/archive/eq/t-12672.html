I went all the way to the tunnel past the &quot;tents&quot; area as well as the Icepaw area and nothing.  I have spent nearly 3 hours going back and forth to both these purported Experiments spots.  And I cannot track them from either spot, the zone in, etc.  I am doing my Epic 2.0...got the Globe today and have two Shards so far.<br />

If you go past that you are near Velks Castle.<br />
 <br />
The Epic mob can spawn anywhere there so I am told.<br />
 <br />
Personally I got mine in a room, which is past Velk, on the left.  There are 6 spawns in the room.  It took 4-5 hours of clearing the castle to get the spawn.<br />

My partner and I had been killing in that area for about an hour or so and got a bad pull- I exodus'd us and we sat there a few minutes. I checked track and there was the Failed Experiment on track. So we went and got him.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes they are already up and sometimes you have to<br />
keep killing the PH mobs.</div></div><hr />
