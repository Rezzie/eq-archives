But if you really wanna solo, you can try charming in Plane of Disease (the rats) until you hit 57-58 and then you can move into Plane of Nightmare (charm the werewolves). At 62 you want to go to Halls of Honor... and then go from there possibly alternating with Noble's Causeway.<br />
<br />
Or you can just start in PoN and charm werewolves.. Remember: Glamour of Karana for magic debuffing the mob you're about to charm first, then ensnare, then Call of Karana!</div></div><hr />

Think you may need level 62 charm to take control of them.  You could also just root/dot or nuke/kite them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
magic debuff spell - Glamour of Tunare (53)<br />
<br />
charm up to level 53 - Call of Karana (52)<br />
- charm those critters in PoD and PoN.<br />
<br />
charm up to level 60 - Command of Tunare (63)<br />
- charm loroks in PoS.<br />
<br />
charm up to level 65 - Nature's Beckon (70)<br />
<br />
<br />
also, levels 55 - 59 are considered HELL levels, this means that the amount of experience needed to ding goes up dramatically!  so don't expect to breeze past them.  you will notice that your exp bar will go up slowly.  my best advice is to not look at your exp bar after a kill because it will make you weep.<br />
<br />
try to hit up some monster missions during these levels as they were changed to scale the experience during hell levels - so you should a nice exp gain from them.  of course, on feb. 21st they will be nerfing the current monster missions so try to find one that gives good exp!</div></div><hr />

Recently I've done 2 of the 3 Dain MM's in Icewell Keep (POR required).  They were fun and interesting.  There is some augment that is dropped at the end - it's broken into 3 different pieces that upgrade it.  Can look at this topic for more info:  http://eq.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=13330<br />
<br />
Info about the Aug: In each mission there is one Portion of a Coldain Historical Seal. Each mission has a different portion piece (Check the Lore Text to find out which is which).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about MM exp at lvl 54, but at 69 I believe I got like 2 blue bars (8% reg exp?).  IMO, the &quot;&quot;The Defense of Thurgadin&quot; Part I aka Dain Frostreaver the First&quot; took less time to complete and gave the same amount of exp per mission.  Perhaps someone can confirm this?<br />
<br />
Side note 1:  I agree with Nimchip - I did the PoN Nightstalker camp from 54-59.  Was able to single pull with harmony and charm the wolfies pretty easy after snare (they walk really slow after snare).  I highly suggest you look into charming techniques on how to optimize the exp.  After lvl 55 or so, I was able to keep the 11 spawn camp clear on a 7 min timer.  <br />
<br />
Side Note 2: PoS Lorok frogs: Root / Dotting the Lorok froggies in the forrest area would yield more exp (froggies are lvl 60).  However I'm not sure on resists from spells if they are more than 4-5 levels above you.  After getting the lvl 63 charm spell (Command of Tunare), the same charming technique I used in PoN and PoD can apply here.</div></div><hr />
