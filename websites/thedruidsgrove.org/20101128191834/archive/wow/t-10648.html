Ive been feral before 1.8 and i find that was great to lvl up, and now almost on 1.10 with our new &quot;innervate&quot; the druids will have more chance of beeing what they want, but even though im full feral since i was a little cat, ive always healed in every instance i went, only with firiends or when healing wasent a problem i cud taste the ways of the beast =)<br />
Im currently lvl 60  14/32/5  towards cat damage and bear tanking (OoC   FTW !)<br />
So im asking help, to teach me how to be feral and not dying on the process..  <br />
What i say is that i nearly dont know why i have 68 of my 80 slots filled with gear..  Healing / Int-mana,regen / bear Sta / Bear  <br />
AC / Cat PvE / Cat PvP /....   i want to have 1 set for all without having rank 13 pvp set  &gt;_&lt;  <br />
I wud like some advice like:  &quot; For bear the best thing to go for is Str / Sta &quot;  or something like that..  cus i always weared things I though i shud, without knowing why.  <br />
Well hope i didnt bore anyone, and hope someone can tell me something to do, or atleast a little tip wud be enough :) <br />
So thats all, thanks to al my brothers here ( even Taurens ;) ), and a hug to you all.<br />
<br />
edit: sorry for my bad english, im just a n00b  =D</div></div><hr />

Knowing exactly when those times will be is tough, so I am like you.  I mainly carry 2 sets of gear, not three.  When I am feral, I have enough strength/sta/agi to make both cat form and bear form benefit.  And I keep the healer set with me.  My bags are always full and so is my bank with bijous and shards, keys, fire resist gear...it's horrible.  The only way I think I can relieve this is to buy up those extra bag slots at the bank, but thats expensive.  This is a gripe of mine actually.  Why make people pay gold to resolve a space issue.  Where does the gold go? It doesn't improve the economy in that city or lower the average cost of trade goods...<br />
<br />
I am not sure if this addressed your subject line.  Unless your role is more specific, like healing, your gonna be swapping gear a lot.  If you were a strong resto build and people picked you up for your healing, you could just run with the heal gear.  That luxury is tempting, but I gotta say, I'd miss my 14/32/5 spec too much.</div></div><hr />

The space issue, well i had  phew alts for my not soulbound stuff, like one alt for herbs, other for pots, and other for coins and bijous, but yea, i guess having a good gear with enough Agi/Str/Sta wud fix the multiple feral gears, thanks for that :)<br />
And finally what you think about new &quot;innervate&quot; will feral /balance druid's have their place now?...</div></div><hr />
