  <br />
The test realms are open to anyone who has a valid World of Warcraft account, so if you want to be one of the first players to try out the Honor System,  click here to copy one of your characters over to the test realm. (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-copy.html) <br />
  <br />
  If you would like to see some of the other features and changes going in next  patch,  click here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/patch-05-04-06.html) to read the test-realm patch notes.<br />
  <br />
Keep in mind remember that experience earned, items obtained, or any changes to your test character will in no way affect your original character on our retail realms, as your test realm character is just a copy of the original. Also, the experience, items, and gold your character gains on the test realm will not be transferred to your character on the retail realms.<br />
  <br />
We appreciate your participation in these tests, as they enable us to deliver higher quality content patches. Thank you all once again for adventuring with us in Azeroth!</div></div><hr />
