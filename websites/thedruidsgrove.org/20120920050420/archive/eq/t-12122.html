<br />
First AA grabbed was Group Camo..LOVE IT..Also its much easier to buy the big one first when you have been storing up. After that it can be very much a challenge to save 12 aas for me.<br />
<br />
Then I have gotten Gift of Mana 1 Abundant Healing 1 Convergence of spirits 1 and Affliction Mastery 1 just to spread it all around a bit.<br />
<br />
After playing a bit since that point I will probably max Gift of Mana first.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last AA I will buy will probably be what I call the big booboo, frankly because I think it would be a big mistake to even bother with that one.</div></div><hr />

GoM3 is ok, I have to remember to watch for it to come up though on  the song list.  Haven't seen abundant healing do anything yet.  Convergence of spirits saved me while kiting, and booboo has now died to every raid mob we have done because of AE rampage.<br />
<br />
Group Camo is by far the best one I have gotten, 30 minute fixed duration instant invis ftw.  30 minutes is my time, I'm not sure what the base duration is.</div></div><hr />

Gift of Mana is better for raid, and is going to be the first AA I max out, followed by Convergance, then the Bear, then Abundant Healing.<br />
 <br />
Bear before healing before quite frankly I like the bear ;p</div></div><hr />

 <br />
dude wtf are you talking about GoM is no different solo in grp or in raid. actually GoM is espeically better out of raid or out of a group, basicly because in a raid you dont go oom so easy.. and if you do that just shows your overdoing something or you just suck ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">09-18-2005, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Granted its useful for everyone.<br />
 <br />
If you look at the AA from a Raiding style point of view however, it clearly dominates.<br />
 <br />
It really depends on the kinds of spells your casting.<br />
 <br />
If your healing with NI and KR and Nuking with GoD or lower nukes becuase you have not gotten your Omens ones, then the chances of you casting something to trigger the effect drops drastically becuase your not using mostly 65+ spells.  Thus, someone who has their spells and is likely on the higher side of the power curve is more apt to see this as a directly bennifical AA choice, esp in terms of raiding where sometimes you chain heal or nuke.<br />
 <br />
If I was at level 65, and did not have SI, I would probly hold off till I was upper 60s before purchasing this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adrius</div><div class="date">09-18-2005, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">interesting how youve changed the subject from this AA being diff in raids grps and solo into something elese, isnt it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fenier</div><div class="date">09-18-2005, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really.<br />
 <br />
A raid orinitated person is more apt to have their spells which would tirgger the AA in the first place.  They are also more apt to be in the higher end content where they are casting those spells more consistantly.<br />
 <br />
While its Similar to SCM, which is awesome reguardless, GoM ONLY works if you are using a 65+ spell.  This means, unless you are on average casting spells of that range, you are not apt to see the benifits to the fullest extent possiable.<br />
 <br />
If your a raider, you are apt to be using SI, CT or Anicent Heals, which are all 65 + and you will notice the differance more readily.<br />
 <br />
If your nuking, then you'd probly be casting Sol Strike, Dawnstrike, Glitter or Glacier - again, all 65 + spells.<br />
 <br />
The bonus is far more noticable in a raid enviroment, becuase you are more apt to be chain casting then in a exp group. This is not always true, but it is enough to the point you need to consider it.<br />
 <br />
If your however, using Summer's Flame as your main Nuke and healing with NI, then you'll never see the bonus reguardless of your level.<br />
 <br />
The AA is awesome, but its not for everyone and it really depends on your playstyle and what you cast.  The fact it requires a 65+ spell to fire is a major limitation to some people, who have yet to recieve those spells.<br />
 <br />
This is less of a cause for concern for a raider, for the simple reason they are more apt to have their spells and to be in content which requires then more often.<br />

I have occasionally had it go off, immediately start to cast another spell and then get a message saying your gift of magic fades.  One time I *think* I had it fade before my spell gems even cleared again.  <br />
<br />
This was while I was doing root rotting, so it wasnt as if I was using spells with long casting times either.  Is the duration variable then?<br />
<br />
On topic:  I love the shared camo because it will stick on lower level characters than our fixed camo.  Gift of magic seems great but this little duration thing is frustrating.<br />

( just wish sotg and conv. were on seperate timers )<br />
GoM effect last longer than enough to cast CH so never had a timing issue.<br />

no booboo, i'm working on thick skin instead !</div></div><hr />

 <br />
havent gotten bobo-on-steroidsx3 (nature's guardian) but so far hes a fun lil guy.<br />
 <br />
LOVE shared camou...i dont have to spend 20 seconds memming a spell, its far more willpower.<br />
 <br />
Convergence? oh let me count the tanks youve saved..one potato..two potato..<br />
 <br />
last but not least, Gift of Mana. I think its really an AA that you cant stare at the song window waiting to proc. When it shows up, YAY! cast a good but expensive spell, its a delightful surprise now and then..just dont hold your breath for it =P<br />
 <br />
PS. New DoT Crit aa isnt too bad either, though i am not seeing too huge a diff.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
that'd be a bitch, after all that work to get it moved from a 22 to a 15min timer... lol<br />
 <br />
Think I'm gonna get silent casting next before either of those. No aggro heal is like divine arbitration... only, it's every 30odd minutes instead of 3 or 4 :whistle: <br />
 <br />
If it was on it's own timer then I'd get conv sooner but otherwise think I'll just grab a vish mask as an inventory clicky for now.</div></div><hr />

Most of the sustained 65+ casting I was doing was in the Hive and the zone may have been buggy.  A couple other people had unusual problems there over last weekend on 7th hammer too I guess.<br />
