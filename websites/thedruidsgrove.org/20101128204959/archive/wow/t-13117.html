I was under the impression druids no longer needed defense to be uncritable?<br />

Heroic bosses hit that hard with their special attacks.  When I first started tanking heroics, Ingvar hit me with both his specials back to back, 12k+ each, non-crit.<br />

It's why regular runs are boring, and heroics are challenging and fun.</div></div><hr />

Or you were sitting?  :bonk: <br />

Other than that I agree 100% with Solar.  You were better off without the noobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, mobs can't crit their spells....hmmmm<br />
<br />
Don't know.  Maybe save off your log next time and we can look at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
large amount there too, and i scrolled up my combat log <br />
<br />
instantly to see what it is, so i discovered this<br />

<br />
Its sick damage, so i suggest you kill/interrupt/cc that mob first, <br />
<br />
or you can easily die from that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Old kingdom has a mob called a &quot;spellfinger&quot; this type of mob is a regular nerubian spider type mob common in the early pulls. His spell is a really long cast, like 6-8 seconds, but his spell hits reallly hard. I thought it was a flat 14k, but i guess it might be 50% health like Aja said. Giggle giggle, try to either be a little more of what you're killing, or read your combat log. Casters should aways be top priority either CC or burn em first.</div></div><hr />
