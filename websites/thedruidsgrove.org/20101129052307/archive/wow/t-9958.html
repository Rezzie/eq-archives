I finally have my Unstoppable Force and Don Julio's band to go with my pvp set. Now I need to finish up AB and WSG to get the peices I want from there.<br />
<br />
 So far: <br />
Cat   1100 AP  23% crit   4000hp 4000mana<br />
 <br />
Bear 10k AC  800 AP (i think)  20% crit 6700 hp 4500 mana<br />
<br />
 Im pretty happy with what I have going now but still want to improve. I want to get my cat hp's up to atleast 4500 and my bear up to 7k.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">01-24-2006, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes sir you can. The Unstoppable Force is 125g and the Don Julios Band is 60g. I didnt even look to see if there was a good healing weapon that I could use. Ill take a look when I get home. You also get a nice upgrade to your Stormpike Insignia.<br />
 <br />
I still havent decided if I want the stormpike Ram or not. I already have an epic mount so I dont need it however I may get it just the heck of it, I think its 90g.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alwarogam</div><div class="date">01-24-2006, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only 90 gold for the epic mount? seriusly? Well i never cared about factions so i dont know much about it. <br />

<br />

 Outside of each BG there is a quartermaster that will tell you what you can buy depending on your current rep.</div></div><hr />
