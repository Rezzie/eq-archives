<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badgemagus</div><div class="date">04-18-2008, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been at least a couple of years since I've been here but I got to say the site is still kicking ass. Great to see. When I dissappeared from here I had rerolled warlock. I was honestly a bit unhappy with the state of the Druid class. Since then I rerolled warrior, ran my own guild on Black Dragonflight, and kicked a bunch of ass and took names. However that being said the game became more of a babysitting job than fun. I really did enjoy running the guild and my officer core was solid, but at that time in my life too much was goi g on to really give my guild the attention it needed. So I closed shop and took a big break from the game. <br />
<br />
I logged in recently and decided to go back to my roots and roll my Druid again. I gotta say he is totaly melting faces. I went balance for the 60-70 grind as opposed to most Druids going feral. For one I learned playing my warrior that I much prefer caster classes and secondly I knew that I would still be more than effective enough to heal instances. Anyway I'm on my iPhone right now so don't shoot me if this has been beat to death already but I would lime to hear from some of you guys who have raided balance before. How have your experiences been and how do you like the raid sets for balance Druids. My guild ran a feral Druid as my OT and he was phenominal for tanking. A lot of events I would let him MT just because he was better suited for the event than a warrior was. Anyway yeah I'd love for you guys to share anything and everything you have to say about it. I'm here to learn and share my own thoughts and opponions. Really. I think there is something to learn from everybody so even if you think its corky or lame please do share. I may not agree however I respect everyones opinion. Anyway enough with my rambling. Thanks to the great people who keep this site still going. Much love and respect. <br />
<br />
P.S. All Druids Feral and Resto too please share. I'm not discriminating LOL, just focused on raiding balance, however that being said I have considered going back to resto. Love feedback</div></div><hr />

Not that anyone really cares. If any of you guys live out here we should grab a coffee and shoot the ****. <br />
<br />
ALSO I am looking for a horde guild. Willing to transfer servers. I don't mean to brag when I say this but when it comes to wow I know my ****. I work hard and I play even harder. I'm not a number cruncher, I don't know how to exploit the game or whatever, but I know my classes inside and out and I play the game very ****ing well. Again I'm not braggi g I'm just looking g for like minded players. Sorry about the typos I'm on my iPhone. Anyway thanks again!</div></div><hr />

Welcome back to our druid grove :&gt;<br />
<br />
Balance druids aren't exactly in high demand at end-game so if you want to make a go of it, you'll need to work hard at your gear and make sure your technique is always cutting edge.  You'll also need to be prepared to heal sometimes.<br />
<br />
Understand that the primary reason to have a Moonkin in a raid is for the spell crit aura; if you can keep up with the other pure dps classes on the damage meters then you'll be more than justifying your raid spot.  :&gt;<br />

Granted I'm only 65 and I don't plan on seeing hardcore endgame content with my moonkin. With that being said I love it. When I'm questing groups love it too.... I can heal like a madman, dps, or even panzerkin. I have had many compliments as a balance healer. In fact I've had a few people say &quot;Wow this is my 4th toon and I've never completed that quest&quot; <br />
<br />
IMHO a 5 person druid group with different specs would be unstoppable. It would be awesome to change group makeup on every boss.... for example <br />
<br />
tank, healer, dps, dps, dps <br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
tank, healer, healer, dps, dps<br />
<br />
etc. the posibilities are endless.<br />

After one shotting 5 first bosses i came second on dps, under 1% behind the mage who was nr1.<br />
And i had to hold back my dps sometimes so i wouldnt take aggro. Since then i have added 3 more points in subtlety so my threat is now 12% lower. I hope to be nr1 on dps next time. And dont forget i gave the mage +5% spellcrit also. My current gear is +946spelldamage and 96spellhit.</div></div><hr />

I don't know much about casters but I'm told that getting lots of spell hit chance early on is a good idea.  :&gt;<br />

Tank? yea, we can do that... Off-tank? SURE! it just makes my job more fun :) Off-heal? yep (even though I'm feral spec'd)... let me just slap on my healer set...<br />
<br />
if you're still looking for a horde guild, I'm an officer of &lt;High and Mighty&gt; in the Crushridge server... We're a causual raiding guild. We have a few different Kara groups for different nights of the week, we're working on the T5 content and are a pretty cool group of people to play with. If you're interested in joining, let me know!</div></div><hr />
