<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">10-25-2006, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the second task in the arc i believe involves killing the direwind current..this is a named mob that can use DT (death touch)on pulling and again every 30 seconds..its kinda like when u kill golems in fear.  be prepared to sacrifice your puller and then go all out dps..this post says he has very little hp so if u can burn him down in 30 seconds you can do with only 1 DT but if u cant then be prepared to sacrifice another group member.  http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=22730<br />
     you wont really need a tank when he only hits 250 points of damage but since he apparently drops 3 of the needed drops at a time i would bring a couple high dps friends at the very least just to be safe. then you will lose 1 member on pulling..the other 2 dps and toss dots then u lose another member after 30 seconds and the last member will have 30 more seconds to burn him down.<br />
    im not sure on the other missions in the arc..dont know how many there are or if will need a tank but the first 2 tasks can be done with 2 - 3 ppl.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Best pulling technique for mobs like that is to convince a pet class that pets eat DTs if you send them in ahead of you.   Functional and entertaining.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vere</div><div class="date">10-28-2006, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got to the stage to kill Direwind current and did so successfully, but got no quest update for kill, yet someone else in my group did (we were both at same stage). I even got the KS.<br />
<br />
Thinking it was a freak, we killed the other current and again no update on quest. I have now looted item though so have completed parts 1 (kill 4mobs)and 3 of the quest (loot item) in the second stage of Arc - The Direwind Plaguebearers.<br />
<br />
I tried turning in item anyway and mob has no need....so Im stuck, and unwilling to do quest again incase I remain bugged.<br />
<br />
I petitioned it and GM&#180;s said it seems I was bugged and had to file a bug report :( :( No response at this stage....<br />
<br />
So I can&#180;t get hold of the elusive ID6 earring :(<br />
<br />
As an aside, pulling with pets to eat DT is indeed functional and entertaining, unless you happen to be said pet&#180;s owner :)<br />

So there is a chance when they get to it the current will no longer DT, but I wouldnt expect them to change anything for a year or so since its making the quest harder atm.<br />

Once they summon rats just evac then run back and then kill them as quickly as you can.  I am uncertain as to whether they can only summon rats once per ratcaller or if their ability is on a long timer, but the rats depop quickly once they lose agro.<br />

(which, for the record, is to kill all the keepers at each spire - you'll need a group, as they summon)</div></div><hr />
