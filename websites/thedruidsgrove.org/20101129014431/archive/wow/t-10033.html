Well... we found out that the company is a big scam.. And we are getting even :)<br />
<br />
We have called numerous times today, up to 6 of us so far, playing charachters and just giving them a hard time. My friends sister talked for 20 min about a butterfly in her pants, another friend got them to call him a redneck for asking them about a bolt not fitting on a muffler. Has been very amusing so far.. well, we need more people to call and get revenge. <br />

Licensing and Bonding Information<br />
<br />
<br />
We believe this company is a Discount Buying Service organization and is therefore subject to certain regulations in California. In general, companies subject to these laws must give written notice of a three day right to cancel; they must establish and escrow account out of which refunds must be paid, and they must post a bond. The law also provides for other types of disclosures which are relevant to the program. It does not appear that the company has complied with this law.<br />

BBB Comments and Analysis<br />
This company makes telephone solicitations offering promotional products and memberships on a trial basis along with coupon packages for gasoline, restaurants, auto services, long distance services or movie passes, as incentives to join their program. If consumers accept their offer, they must call to cancel the membership within seven days or risk incurring additional membership charges. Membership fees vary between $19.95 per month to $99.95 per year. We urge extreme caution. Ask the company to send information regarding the membership terms and conditions prior to accepting the offer. Prior to agreeing to the purchase, consider asking the company for the phone number to cancel since customers report the membership is not received prior to the seven day expiration of the cancellation period. Customers claim the only way this company accepts cancellations is over the phone; therefore, requests for cancellations may be difficult to implement. Verify your bank statement to confirm all charges are valid. If there is an unauthorized charge contact the bank to dispute the amount.<br />

Complaint Experience<br />
Of the complaints we have received against this company, in at least some cases, the complaint allegations are very serious.<br />
<br />
All complainants allege they were unable to cancel the membership before the company debited their checking account for the full membership fees. In addition, customers state that they were to only pay $4.95 and receive $500 worth of coupons, but instead they were charged hundreds of dollars in most cases and never received the coupons. Despite the company's offer of a refund, some consumers report that they never received them.<br />

Government Actions<br />
Agency: Attorney General (AG)-SAMP/Credit Svcs<br />
Description: On June 3, 2005, the North Dakota Attorney General, Wayne Stenehjem issued a Cease and Desist Order against Consumer Rewards Network and its affiliates Mega Movie Club, Health Network and Net Forever.<br />
<br />
The company is believed to be engaged in deceptive telephone solicitations in North Dakota. The company calls customer with claims that they are from Wal-Mart and offer vouchers for Wal-Mart shopping sprees worth up to $500 for a nominal fee withdrawn automatically from bank accounts. The company used the consumer account information to commit the consumer to various additional and automatic charges for movie and health services, which was not affiliated with the bogus solicitations.<br />
<br />
The investigation exposed the companies' fraudulent practices and prompted Stenehjem to issue the Cease and Desist Order prohibiting the company from conducting business in North Dakota. Violations of the order subjects the business to civil penalties of $1000.00 per violation of the Order. The solicitations also are violations of the consumer fraud law and could result in civil penalties up to $5000 per violation.<br />
<br />
Consumers in North Dakota who are solicited by this business should contact the Attorney General's Protection Division toll-free at 1-800-472-2600.<br />

The suit further alleges that the violated State law by calling consumer's whose name appeared on the Do Not Call Registry, and failing to register as a telemarketer in the State. The State's request for injunction was granted .

The case is pending.<br />

Advertising Review<br />
We believe this company's advertising is deceptive and misleading. Reports received indicate this company is advertising BBB membership, implying that a percentage of their recievables actually benefits the BBB, and even verbally advising prospective buyers that the BBB requires them to record and retain their customers' bank account or credit card numbers. This information is false. This company is not a BBB member, nor do any financial considerations benefit the BBB in any form. Any references by sales personnel concerning BBB requirements for collection of personal information is also untrue. It is not within the scope of our activities to propose or dictate a company's policies or operating procedures.<br />
