<br />
I am a 56 druid and 300 tribal leatherworker/skinner.<br />
<br />
On several threads i noticed people saying that Lworking is not good to make money and gathering will get you richer.<br />
<br />
I was wondering what kind of money are we talking about here?<br />
<br />
Because as a lworker imho i am doing fairly well for my level.<br />
<br />
I try to get off AH mats for all my blue items from lower to higher lvls. Examples like Gem studded belt, Shadowskin gloves, Barbaric Bracers, Devilsaur gaunts and legs etc...<br />
<br />
Of course my main item is the Devilsaur gauntlets, i sell them for 55g, 95% in the first 24 hours auction and i am making about 25g profit on it. And thats because im buying the leather, at lvl 60 i can solo the leather farming.<br />
<br />
But bottomline is that i can make 100g profit on a good day.<br />
<br />
Negotiating is required of course, i won't just walk and buy the mats at any price. And some mats i usually farm.<br />
<br />
On a side note, i made an alt rogue who is lvl 20 now and 190 enchanting, i make him the items to disenchant and raise his skill or sell the mats as another fairly nice way of profit.<br />

I hear ya.  I've been grinding for the mats forever it seems.  Those damn carion grub things never drop larval acid for me, and I was about to tear my eyes out grinding the water elementals in Felwood.  Luckily I just got a Transmute Undeath to Water recipie, so my Essence of Waters are taken care of.  And the drop rate for Living Essence off the tar guys in Un'Goro sucks, but its not as low as for water.  I admit, I'm not the most dedicated grinder - I feel bad turning down guildies asking me to run ZG or some other instance with them by saying &quot;sorry, cant now I'm grinding.&quot;  So far after a month I have:<br />
<br />
10 Living Essence (need 2 more)<br />
6 Essence of Water (need 4 more, transmuting 1 per day)<br />
3 Larval Acid (need 5 more)<br />
<br />
No idea as to how to get Cured Rugged Hides other than AH.  What mats are necessary to get a LW to make them for me?  I know there is a cooldown of 1 day on it.  The other mats are easy to get.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jimmay</div><div class="date">03-28-2006, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found some of my mats on the AH for a fair price, given the timesink to actually farm them. Had a few skinners provide the skins. The hardest part was the larval acids for me by far. They are pretty rarely found on the AH for around 10g each, and I wasn't about to spend that kinda money for a single one. Fighting with the round the clock farmers in Felwood for the Essence of Water was pretty damn annoying though, stupid hunters farming them non-stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have the HotW pattern on Cenarion Circle server.  I'm not a dedicated grinder or AH hawk either.  But I still manage about 150g profit for every one of those things I sell.  I buy nearly all the mats, but I skin my own hide and leather.  I sell about one a week, depending on how much I play.  I could make and sell more, but I don't have the time, unfortunatly.<br />
<br />
Another great cash strategy is to get rep up with Thorium Brotherhood, and get their epic patterns.  Unless you are in a dedicated MC group or guild, you won't be making many of them, but I craft them for tips/commission, usually making 20-30g at a time.  If your MC group is in a position to grind mats and sell the items (lava belt, corehound boots, corehound belt) sell some and split the cash.</div></div><hr />

I believe that there is not good or bad in tradeskills, it is really up to your effort as the goal for everyone is to hit 300 imho.<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work and you will hit it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swearword</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main thing you should consider is can you make gear that is equivalent to your lvl if so than you are on the right track.<br />
<br />
Also it depends on your focus in game right now my focus is lvling my toon as opposed to my profs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sond</div><div class="date">04-07-2006, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can make good money off any combination of tradeskills if you play it right. I have 300 mining 300 enchanting. Lately I've been making 50-100g per day without trying at all. Mine any nodes I run across while travelling and maybe do a couple enchants in IF when I hearth to clear out my bags. Disenchant BoP blues I can't use and sell the shards.<br />
<br />
I paid 20g + mats for Hide of the Wild. I got the Living Essence for 40g, the essence of water for 30g, larval acid for 25g, and got guildies to make the hide. 115g altogether. It took me about a week of checking the AH to get those prices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HE HAS 999999g, 99s, 99c STILL!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gathering professions just tend to make you great amounts of money while you're leveling up from 1-55+? I guess because you can get the herbs/ores/leathers while leveling and because it doesn't cost much to get started and doesn't involve much time investment.<br />
<br />
I think in the end though (level 55+ where you hvae a decent starting amount of money), once you get better producing professions, that is what will make you the money. Stick with it.</div></div><hr />
