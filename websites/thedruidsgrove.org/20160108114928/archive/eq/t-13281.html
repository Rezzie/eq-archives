My current problem is keeping him from running at 12%. Even if I clear the roaming dragons in the scar and the 3 static ones to the west, he always ends up agroing all kinds of stuff.<br />

Serpent Vines lands on him, but even snared he runs (stops for about 30 seconds then starts to run again) and I can't keep enough dps on him to kill him before he leaves the scar. I've even tried pulling him to ToV entrance (once he warped up top when he ran which was doubly bad). I suppose I'll just have to get really lucky with the roaming dragons. Also, savage root like never lands on him, even with tash stick, spore spiral will land but refresh still isn't fast enough.</div></div><hr />
