<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">11-02-2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of additions/corrections:<br />
<br />
First, here is a map that shows the basement rooms as part of the big map.  The basements are the locations of the NPCs for the three HoH trials.<br />
<br />
http://www.eqatlas.com/planes/hallsofhonormap.html<br />
<br />
Alekson Garn - maidens<br />
Rhaliq Trell - villagers<br />
Trydan Faye - dragon (Rydda'Dar)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the directions in the guide may be off slightly (this may be because the map link given in the guide has the map arranged with West up, not North).    <br />
<br />
The first camp is described as number 2 in the SW.  This actually is in the SE.   The second camp (no. 4) is in the NW, not the NE.   And the third camp (no. 1 on the map) is in the NE, not the SE.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may also want to add Halls 5 and 6 to your list of soloing areas.</div></div><hr />

The Hero Shrine is a very nice spot to solo either root/rotting or quadding in one of 2 rooms depending if there is a named up or not.  It has a long hallway that you can kite the Sentries (unsnarable) and is an excellent solo spot.  Its also possible to quad using the never used mobs all along the walkways.  Granted its tight quarters on walkways but it is very doable if all other camps are taken.<br />

Have gone to one of the basements recently to solo, and the guide was a huge help in getting me there safely.<br />
<br />
Root/rotting will be how I handle it for now, I'm nowhere close to being able to quad down there.  Well, I could with LOTS of med-kiting, but that's no fun.  You guys who quad down there are amazing!<br />

Anyway, thanks again!<br />

I'm curious as to what size of mana pool would be needed to quad here?  I find quadding to be much more exciting than root/dot or regular nuke kiting.<br />

Here is my magelo profile, do you think this is something I could accomplish?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidian Blade</div><div class="date">01-16-2004, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say yes.  With the FT13 you have, plus KEI and the over 4k manapool, you should be fine.  I have attempted this half a dozen times with my manapool being just under 4k and have ran out of mana every time.  I'm confident once I get it over 4k and add a few more FT items it will be doable.<br />
<br />
Granted, you don't have many of the AAs that make your Druid a &quot;better&quot; Druid, I'd still say try it out and see how it works for you.</div></div><hr />

Without VoQ I use the lumi staff a little bit while my mana goes up (self buffed standing mana regen of 34), as well as using epic dot at least once per mob (which I do anyways on the resistant ones even if I have VoQ, which is only when it's left over after a raid).<br />
<br />
Haven't tried since I picked up my 100k horse.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it's harder since I'm quadding the white armors in the first room of the SE basement instead of humans, don't really care, no one ever kills them.  I just go there to finish VoQ up after raids because if I go anywhere else I tend to die if I have VoQ/KEI up unless I'm in a group.</div></div><hr />

unless there is a sentry or named.<br />
<br />
plenty of room to kite on each side.. <br />
first clear west room , then you have the room free to med in, until you go quad the east side.  there is a chance for nameds 1 per side, but not very frequent.<br />
<br />
i haven't done it since i'm upgraded to FoM1, 2 but i imagine it's easier now than before.  i'm currently working up the nerve to try a quad at the picnic tables in Fire.  one mistake and you're dead.<br />
<br />
*EDIT*<br />
can't solo quad the picnic table in fire ... yet,  but with a wizzie i can duo a quad.. VERY nice xp.. was around 25% - 30% AA per quad ( hard to tell exactly since all don't die together ).<br />
MC3, SCM3, FoM2, FT9...had KEI, Bo9.  about 5200 mana pool<br />

I was able to finish the quad before ensnare wore off, but I think it is more efficient atm to root/dot till I get a larger pool.</div></div><hr />

That's a lot worse than I thought you'd do with your stats.  I can get a quad down to about 15-20% with 3945 Mana, FT5 and KEI.  I usually have to resnare by the time they're at 10%.  Therein lies the difference with some choice AAs, ie: SCM3, SCF3, MC1 and IE2.  Get a mix of these AAs and with your current stats/gear you should have NO problems quadding with leftover mana.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BGrifter</div><div class="date">02-14-2004, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been wondering about this a bit lately, where exactly is the minimum to consistantly quad four mobs from snaring down to all four dead with no med kiting?<br />
<br />
I've done about 25-30 AAs now quadding in HoH and my gear has finally reached the point where i'm working with FT8, clicky Phylactery (2 mana per tick), SCM3, SCF3, FOM1, MC1, and at a rough estimate (at work so I can't check my Magelo) around 4500ish mana before KEI. Currently with KEI and self buffs I usually get down to the 10% mana mark with the mobs around 10-15% HP left and med kite the rest of the way. Never have problems with snare wearing off anymore.<br />
<br />
Stopped by the tribute master for FT5 and another 150 mana, that didn't quite put me over the top but it's getting closer. :) Anyone remeber the point where they went from med kiting the last little bit to consistant clean kills? Also, how much of a difference did a horse make? Still toying with the idea of shelling out for a 100k one to replace my old rope bridal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noliniel</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Horse would make a huge difference  if you can handle it. Cause the slow start on horse sometimes can really ruin your day. with horse I am guessing you can finish them with like 30 to 40 mana left. Not too sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xxithiss</div><div class="date">02-15-2004, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would one kite on a horse, after they fixed the bug where one got the benifit of the horse w/o the drawbacks if they had new models off.  As it is now, you would only get the medding rate after you came to a complete stop, which, as you would only stop to cast, you would get ~25 once, maybe twice per cast, depending on whether the cast time overlapped 2 ticks of the clock or 1.  All the time spent moving would do nothing to get mana back on a mount, and that is the majority of the time spent kiting.<br />
<br />
On a side note, where would it be a good place to aggro-kite with a druid-shaman duo?  My poison dots are hella aggro, aggro that a druid could never dream of having. Being able to kite with 3 dots on a mob, refreshing them as they fade, and losing mana at the rate of about 5% mana per 10k of damage in dots, due to canni while waiting to refresh the dots, while keeping the aggro off my gf's druid makes for some fast exp.  800/tick in dots from me, 200/tick in damage from my pet, 40 per tick from my pet-storm AA, plus all that she does adds up very very fast.<br />
<br />
The only problem is adds.  Due to the fact that the snarer isnt the one that holds aggro, it means that until I get a dot or two cast, she is kiting the add/pull.  Its not a matter of life or death, but a place safe from adds is FAR better than one with.<br />
<br />
Where, if any, would be a good place to kite in HoH or other planes that we could pull decent mobs to, and have little to no chance of adds?</div></div><hr />

There are  also some spaces in the HOH basement if you do it carefully. I forgot which one but there is a basement with only 3 mobs. You could try there for aggro kiting. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otzberger</div><div class="date">03-26-2004, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings all. This might sound like a n00b question, but I normally play my Ranger. My wife has taken a &quot;break&quot; from EQ so I am working on her Druid now.... she might come back after seeing this thread. She likes to quad and charm solo. I'm working on getting her 2 Ornate wristbands and some other FT items (to add to FT3 boots and earring of the solstice) to get her to about FT 8 at least.<br />
<br />
My question is this: Is MC3 the same as FT3? She is 1 AA from SCM3 and if MC is like FT 3 then I will get those AAs ASAP.<br />
<br />
My next project is to create a magelo for her.... will post that in this post later.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

so MC1 is FT1 ( or mana regen +1 now )<br />
MC2 is FT2 ( or mana regen +2 now )<br />
MC3 is FT3 ( or mana regen +3 now )<br />
<br />
MC1 great buy... <br />
diminishing returns after that.<br />
MC2 ok, MC3 not so good.<br />
<br />
SCM is the best ability.. and you want it maxed.<br />
it will be worth a lot more than MC3</div></div><hr />

After I max out SCM3 (1AA away) I will go for MC3 just to save a little on FT items.... really expensive on AB server.

You make it sound as if ALL dire charm pets are capped at 149, which is simply not true.<br />
<br />
A Wrulon Youngling in HoH will hit no harder than 149, though, that's their max damage.  They won't use weapons, so don't bother giving them any =)  <br />
<br />
I've had a few other DC pets that hit far harder than that, and with two weapons, will quad.  The most recent example were the hynids in Natimbi, who (until recently) would hit for 234.</div></div><hr />
