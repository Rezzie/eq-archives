<br />
I was thinking about taking a week break from the boredom of XP/AA camps and now *BAMMM* it's gone.<br />
<br />
While I'm sure the sparkle of a new expansion will wear off in a couple weeks, this does break up boring camps quite nicely.  Not only can I earn XP/AA and nab a couple nice items from Named creatures, I'm earning Adventure points as well!!<br />
<br />
/hats off -- to Verant!<br />
<br />
Thanks guys!</div></div><hr />

The raids are really really lame though. Yes they hard but they are hard in a almost impossible way. Huge aggro range, mobs hit hard and fast, huge resist rate, lame loots. Is a time sinker really. The given time wasn't enough for us =/ Mind you we were killing fast as we can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 04:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, I wish it had a CD so I could break it into a million little pieces.  <br />
<br />
Problem is that Scirocco has been inaccessible for several days after completing my LDON instance.  I went LD during the gate out, and since then the client crashes whenever I attempt to log him in.  He shows up for about 5 min. in PoK, apparently, but even guides can't summon him.  A /who all scirocco shows him in PoK, but a /who scirocco from someone in PoK doesn't.   It's not the client, as I can log in all other mule characters on the account, including ones in PoK (I deleted PoK files and repatched anyway, to no avail).<br />
<br />
Guides said it would take GM assistance, but I haven't seen any GM in the days since the problem occurred.  Guide said that they are handling lots of LDON problems like this.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps my not buying the expansion was the best decision after all.</div></div><hr />

He's stuck zoning then, you can see people logging into the game ahead of time with /who all personname before they actally enter the zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I've sent an email, maintained a continuous petition-watch, spoken with several guides, etc.   Still stuck.  *shrugs*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deabbas</div><div class="date">09-14-2003, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this exact problem numerous times zoning into EJ or Trak's Teeth about a year ago. (I actually quit playing because of it) <br />
<br />
Only solution I could come up with was to have someone else log me in and gate me to PoM.<br />
<br />
I hope it gets fixed, it's a real bummer. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AbsorEQ</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try deleting the file for the zone you're in and then run a thorough file check.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, hit our tech forums.  They can probably help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scirocco</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Absor.  I did try that first thing, but didn't work.  Turned out I had to delete everthing EQ related and reload EQ from scratch.  Heh...hadn't seen the original CD since about the first month EQ went commercial.<br />
<br />
The guides did their best, but didn't have the power to do anything (such as move me).   GM did show up on Sunday, and did move me, but I still had the crashing problem.   That's when I decided to bite the bullet with reloading everything. The CS staff all were courteous and as helpful as they could be. <br />
<br />
BTW, LDON does seem to be popular, and aside from the above crash incident, I have no complaints about the expansion.  <br />
<br />
Since you're here, though, can you answer a little question, please:  are there reward levels beyond 1492?  <br />
<br />
And if not, are there plans to add any?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ya would figure that, since at that point the two old worlds combined to the &quot;New World&quot;... eventually achieving where we are today..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AbsorEQ</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;are there reward levels beyond 1492?[/quote]<br />
<br />
Nope, I can't answer that.  Some folks like to discover stuff on their own...  :) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oddjob1244</div><div class="date">09-15-2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was very impressed with the smooth install of LDoN too. However I kinda miss the emergency patches, it was like christmas. <br />
<br />
The only thing I dont like after my first day in LDoN. It took forever for the bodies to pop outside the dungeon. You cant zone a clr in to rez can you (outside original group)? You just have to wait until the instance is over and your bodies pop outside right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DemonMage</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is correct, unless you have a cleric/paladin in your group (or I suppose a necro if you wanna use an essence emerald) you'll have to wait until your corpse pops outside to get a rez.<br />
<br />
[Edit] Also, i'm fairly impressed with LDoN, I've only had a chance to do like 5, maybe 6 adventures though. They're overall fairly fun. Just don't have a whole lot of time to do them lately, after raiding is over, usually time for bed =-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Divina</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish there was a command that would pop out my corpse from the instance.  So I don't have to wait for the dungeon to disappear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be a nice little improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Divina</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No that would not be a &quot;little&quot; improvement.  It would be the answer to the majority of people's problems thus far with LoDN.<br />
<br />
It would allow me to finsh up my adventure then type the command.  It would send my corpse outside and then I could get a rez.  Then I can go do another adventure, instead of waiting for it to pop then searching for a rez, then going off to try another adventure.  It would cut out at least 30 mins, and those 30 mins do build up over time.<br />
<br />
It would also help to solve the reports of this (http://pub148.ezboard.com/fpaladinsofnorrathgeneral.showMessage?topicID=18797.topic) issue.<br />
<br />
So I don't see how you can say that would just be a &quot;little&quot; improvement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This happened to me once on one of my toons.  I could use other toons from the same account, and any other account, but not that particular character.  Eventually, I got a gm to move him while I was on another account.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how it works, but somehow they can take over your body or something like that and move you even if you are in a place the normal client throws up on.  At least that's what it sounded like from his explanation.<br />
<br />
Hope they fix it for you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Batou062671</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had this problem and was able to fix it by deleting ALL of my texture cache files and the zone I went LD in.  Seemed to have somethign to do with being able to see the sky because if I looked down I could stay connected but as soon as I would look up and saw the sky EQ would bomb out.  Managed to zone that way into a zone where you see the sky.  Then I couldn't log in at all the way you described.  Once I deleted the texture cache and zone files the problem went away.  Since you did that for the zone files, it was most likely the texture cache that was causing the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like a good reason to include a cleric or paladin in your group, or a druid/wizard for succor/evac .... yay for class interdependancy :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArienneDileas</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LDoN seems like a great addition to the whole of EQ.  I think it would have been much better had this supplemental type of dungeon had entered EQ ages ago.  What I see happening is people burning themselves out on this after a few days of LDoN's release.  I don't think LDoN will have NEAR the staying power of releases like Velious, Luclin and PoP.   But it's a good shot in the arm for a tired game :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinjun Evolution</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this expansion because if you're a casual player and only have about 2 hours to play a night, the dungeon adventure fits perfectly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oddjob1244</div><div class="date">09-16-2003, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe I didnt use exodus cuz I didnt know what would happen. The last thing I wanted to do was screw over my first LDoN group. <br />
<br />
I'd rather not rely on having a rezzer in my group =). <br />
<br />
Hailing the Adventure Recruiters as group leader and clicking the &quot;We have failed button&quot; ending the instance and poping all your bodies outside would rock. Even better, an NPC there to Hail for a rez.</div></div><hr />
