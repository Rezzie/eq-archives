Not sure if its a very appropriate question, but I was wondering if there is any armor that would look good for a wedding that a level 59 male Druid Halfling could wear / acquire? We hope to be getting married on January 28 (exactly one year after we met) if the bride's primary account is back up by then, so a quick response would be greatly appriciated. Many thanks, in advance.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Crystal Chitin Armplates <br />
Crystal Chitin Boots <br />
Crystal Chitin Chestguard <br />
Crystal Chitin Gauntlets <br />
Crystal Chitin Leggings <br />
 <br />
Its plate armor that a druid can use.  If you dye it white i hear it looks pretty cool.<br />

You could get a set of Elder Spiritist (old Kunark armor) would probably look good.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking about Elder Spiritist's for everything, but I'm poor and it's WAY too expensive, besides, I saw some pictures of people in all Elder armor and it looked really weird... The Crystal Chitin sounds good though, heh, might be odd to not be wearing green all the time... And no, the bride is a Gnome, not an Ogre, although I'd still marry her if she were... As for the shaving my feet... GRRRR! Halflings take pride in our foot hair! How dare you?! EEK! Kidding! Don't hurt me!</div></div><hr />

It just grows back in coarse and unmanagable.  I have had my foot hair both braided and highlighted.  Those are choices if you are looking for something to do with it.<br />
 <br />
As far as armor, I don't remember what it is called but there was some pretty easy to get armor in kael that looked kind of unique, I guess more chain like.  Chitin would be nice though as well and something different.<br />

Congratulations on the upcoming wedding.  Halfling + Gnome...sounds like some cute babies.</div></div><hr />
