It is called Feralheart. From what I have read you have to have your wildheart still to turn in with the quest items to get the upgraded armor set. This is considered a tier .5 by Blizz again from what I have read. <br />
<br />
Here is the link to Wow's post with a dressing room to show you what it will look like.<br />
<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/items/armorsets/<br />
<br />
It is dungeon set 2 <br />
<br />
Here is a walkthrough for the Alliance side I found on the WOW forums from Clumsyd working on the set in the test realms. Also if you feel like reading through the 9 page forum here is that link.<br />
<br />
<br />
*taken from a post by Clumsyd on WOW forums*<br />
FULL QUEST LINE (Alliance) <br />
<br />
Posted in Test server forums, <br />
<br />
This is the order in which you do tier.5, i am going off memory so i may forget somethings. <br />
also this is alliance version (sorry hordies) <br />
<br />
First you go to IF and talk to the human in the throne room, she sends you to winterspring to gather blood samples off bears and cats ( the brown bears didn't seem to drop for me) when you return to IF you get the bracer. <br />
<br />
(this part is a bit fuzzy as i did it really early in the morning, i know a lot of people have done this part so someone can correct me if i am wrong) <br />
<br />
She sends you to gadgetzan to talk to a goblin, he is in the same room as the master goblin engineer, he sends you to gather ashes off the ground in burning stepes, when you return w/ the ashes he takes a few of the items from your bag (that bliz gave you) and sends you to gather ecroplas, from ghosts in (silithus, EPL and winterspring) <br />
<br />
tip* while in winterspring, go to darkwisper gorge and get the rod that costs 50g off the imp in the first cave...you will need it <br />
<br />
<br />
After you gather the ectoplasma return to goblin, he sends you to kill a named magma elemental in steppes when you return he sends you to get the rod in winterspring (but you should already have that) he sends you back to IF to talk to the human in throne room, she gives you belt/gloves and sends you to talk to a ghost outside strath w/ the ghost revealer you made. <br />
<br />
The ghost outside strath is the ghost that gives you the 45 min baron run quest (this is the blocking point of the quest) get a 5man group and try your best... <br />
<br />
After the 45 min baron run you return to the ghost and he sends you to DM library. the librarian in DM gives you a quest to gather ogre warbeads off the ogres in DM and BRS. we did not do the ones in BRS, the ogres outside DM north have a very low droprate 1:30 or so, the ogres inside DM north are about 1:5. <br />
once you have your 25 beads you return to the librarian, he sends you to gather an essence off a ghost in DM (plus other items bliz gave you) the essence is a group drop and you do not need the quest to have it drop, everyone in our party got it and 2 did not have quest. when you return to the librarian he gives you a banar to take to BRD... <br />
<br />
In BRD you need to clear to the arena, once inside you drop the banner as a challenge, you fight ba wave of nasties (normal arena thing) <br />
then out of the second door you have a pvp type fight.. the group was a warrior, 2 rogues and 2 mages, they are immune to taunt the act smarter then regular mobs. <br />
once you beat them you get a BOP blue from a chest, (this event is also farmable as you keep the banner) <br />
<br />
And now you return to the ghost outside strath, he sends you to Ironforge to get your legs, shoulders boots. <br />
<br />
The chick in IF sends you to BRS to talk to a ghost (he is on the ledge near BRS entrence outside the instance)the ghost gives you a RAID quest to slay incendrius (now immune to stuns) emberseer in UBRS (the fire elemental with the 8 orcs keeping him restrained) and duke of flame in silithus. then you return to ghost. <br />
<br />
The ghost sends you to do a random task based off your class. as a warrior i was sent to silithus to gather the druids remains off a silithid was a 59 elite bug ( all the quests were at least duoable if not soloable) <br />
<br />
Once you get your item you return to ghost and he sends you to an instance to summon a boss based off your previous quest. mine was in LBRS in voones room, after voon is dead you summon the boss (in this case a tauren druid) once you slay the druid everyone on the quest gets the quest drop, even if they did a different prequest. <br />
<br />
Then you return to the ghost who sends you to gather blood kelp, it drops off the nagas in duskwallow marsh (59-60 elites) also ground spawns on the island w/ the nagas common drop. <br />
<br />
When you return to the ghost you get another random class quest mine was to kill giants in winterspring, (paly friend had the same one as my first one) after we were both done we went back and did voones boss again. <br />
<br />
Then you return to ghost and wants you to gather bracers off orcs in BRS, the orcs in UBRS had a much higher drop rate than the LBRS ones. <br />
<br />
You turn in your bracers (from the orcs) and flask that blizzard gave you and now summon and fight lord valethak (in the beasts room) <br />
*Raid encounter* <br />

So I assume you only need the item that you are turning in for to get the upgrade. <br />

I didn't realize they were also redoing the set bonuses on the wildheart set.  Looking forward to the patch more now.<br />
<br />
I don't think its that bad in terms of work.  Most people spent weeks if not months building their full set, and this turns half of them into epics.  It should be challenging and involved.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if as you upgrade pieces you'll get set bonuses for each (for instance when you have 6 wildheart and 2 feralheart will you get the 6 piece bonus from one set and the 2 piece bonus from the other?)  Is that why the bonuses seem to invert? (The 8 piece bonus on one is the 2 piece bonus on the other)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is the way I understood it. Which means Blizz was thinking that way once you get two pieces of feral heart you still have all the bonuses you would have had in full wildheart thereby not punishing you for upgrading.<br />

<br />
can anyone clarify that the quest requires u to get to baron and kill him in under 45 min?<br />
<br />
and if so how has the instance changed to make this not so impossible...?</div></div><hr />

Its very frustrating to pony up the funds to buy these trade goods from the AH, as well as the 40G to even turn the thing in.  Its leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  Feeling like Bliz is just trying to weed some more funds out of the economy.  Similar to the PAL and LOCK epic mount quests.  Its really my hope I can get thru these so-called-quests without blowing 1kG.  Jeez, might as well just sell the Dungeon Set 2 (DS2... please not Tier 0.5) at the chick that begins the line for 100G a piece and save everyone the running around and useless trade goods.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lorath</div><div class="date">03-30-2006, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt worry about the cost of getting the set. I doubt many people will even get past the 45 min Baron run. Fellow guildmates and myself ran this 4 or 5 times last night and the closest we got was fighting the 6 skeletons before Barons chamber when the time ran out.<br />
<br />
In order to even come close to doing this, you cannot stop pulling mobs. When a mob is about to die, you pull the next. Many mobs you have to skip such as the ones to the left/right of the ziggurauts and along the walls getting there. If you wipe even once, there is no chance you can do it.<br />
<br />
We tried a few different combinations to do this: <br />
1 Priest, 1 Druid, 1 Tank, 1 Warlock, 1 Rogue<br />
1 Priest, 1 Druid, 1 Warlock, 2 Rogues<br />
and Im looking into trying...<br />
1 Druid, 1 Mage, 3 Fury Spec Warriors<br />
1 Priest, 1 Druid, 1 Mage, 2 Rogues<br />
<br />
The people in the party must have the best blue gear at the very least to accomplish this. Our guild is running ZG regularly and just started MC and we are struggling with this. If anyone finds any nice tips, please let me know.<br />
<br />
I heard a tip to clear the 3 Ziggurauts then running to the Abomintion room and dieing there, soul-stoning up, and rezzing the party and moving on. That alone would save about 4 or 5 pulls...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both female and male. That's me and one of our other druids after he finnished getting his :)<br />
<br />
Valthalaks actually the hardest. I had our main tank, GM and a few officers and we still wiped once before we got the hang of him. Know the tactics is the best advice I can give, we didn't and we died :p<br />
<br />
He also drops a really nice staff http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=22335 :)<br />
