<br />
Background: <br />
Level 73<br />
110AAs<br />
around 8k mana 6k health<br />
I do have my 1.5 though<br />
not up to date with spells : (<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
I normally solo, would it be better to not have a merc with me at all or should I try duoing with the tank?<br />
<br />
If I use the tank merc, what can the lowest rank tank handle?<br />
<br />
Since my spells are not up to date I have a hard time charm killing mostly because I can't dps fast enough and the charm keeps breaking so i eventually run out of mana.  So most of the time I just root rot. Is there somewhere I can go with the tank merc were I can efficently keep him healed instead?</div></div><hr />

They take part of the xp earned (more than their share imo :boohoo: ). Just charm kite, root rot, or quad kite, whichever you feel comfortable with. I would advise charm kiting once you have both entrap aa and innate camo UNTIL level 83 or so. Then root rot or kite normally.<br />
 <br />
Merc tanks can't handle much, but don't waste your money on a lower level merc. If you're going to buy one then buy the best one available to you or don't purchase it at all. The lower they are the less they can do and you will find yourself complaining about wasting plat, when you dismiss a merc to buy a better one. Even a tier IV journeyman mercenary can't tank named outside of oceangreen very well. It is capable of tanking them though, but just barely. However, with a slower, dps, and maybe a cleric, the mercenaries become very useful since you don't have to waste hours looking for a tank.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what I am doing wrong but I can barely kill these things. First I entrap a mammoth then use the lvl 71 charm spell which gets resisted a lot.  Next I entrap another mammoth and then root it.  I then let them duke it out while I dot the un charmed one down.  The charm breaks so often though I am always running out of mana.  Also I think I am supposed to break the pet off when one is about to die so I get more exp but I am having trouble with that because the &quot;go away button&quot; doesn't work.  Any suggestions would be awsome  :)</div></div><hr />

Cast that on mob after you snare and charm should land quicker.  (did we ever get an upgrade to this spell?  I ask cause I never really do the charm thing...too lazy)<br />
 <br />
If the &quot;go away&quot; is broken just camo yourself that will break the charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oakdad</div><div class="date">01-27-2009, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When charming these days the method is snare say 4 or so mobs then cast the glamor spell then charm one of the mobs and turn it on the others.  Once your pet is almost dead break charm and kill it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Getting back to your merc question - I came back at lvl 67, and bought a T5 apprentice tank, and he's great for my purposes.  Debuff a mob (Hand of Ro/Fixation of Ro) and he can usually go 1-2 blues before needing a heal.  I just stand back and nuke away.  Maybe not as efficient as root/rotting, but more interesting.  I also use him when charming - he holds aggro on a mob, and if charm breaks is quick to grab aggro on the old pet.  It lets me aggressively take on summoners and others I'd usually avoid (at 67 I would take 1 frog, my merc, and clear out everything in Plane of Storms.)</div></div><hr />

If you find that firenukes get resistet alot when need to finish the mobs, simply use magic dot - or some other spell that land easy.<br />
Get the charm version RK. 2 - it has a lower breaking rate as well - will be a great help to you.</div></div><hr />
