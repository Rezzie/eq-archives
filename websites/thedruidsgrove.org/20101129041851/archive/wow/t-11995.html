Think about it, most of the guys out there watching soaps are a lil feminine &amp; the girls I have come across that play wow are a lil masculine.  Women generally watch soaps while the men are at work and while guys play wow the woman should be cooking/cleaning right? JK<br />
<br />
Seriously though my daughter has been pissed all summer cause I let her older brothers play wow longer then I let her. Maybe im just old fashioned but I really don’t want my daughter addicted to video games though it doesn’t bother me so  much that her brothers are. Am I wrong about this and should I let her play wow as much as her brothers do??..i just don’t know....</div></div><hr />

But I am really wondering where he is going with this. Besides trying to start a big discussion about the topic, what is he to gain? I just don't get it.</div></div><hr />

post about issues on who gets to play and when, and such basic stupidity like that.  then use that log in name, come one.. thats like a unquestionable spamming troll</div></div><hr />

We're all always talking about usual girl stuff. I don't see how a girl playing is any different to a guy.<br />

He's probably just pissed cause his daughter was better than him at it :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of people when they find out you're a girl tend to either take the piss or try and hit on you. But thankfully there are some decent people out there too (/wave to everyone except the dude who started this thread:gunfight:)<br />
<br />
I think some guys just have a problem with letting us into their 'guy' world :p <br />

<br />
She was level-headed and made a good contrast to all the hormone-stuffed guys in the raid. One of the best officers I ever had.<br />
<br />
Still.. many wow-women are downright headache-emos.. but I guess that goes for both genders. ;)<br />

Yaya i know.. don't feed the trolls. *prowl*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrækLord</div><div class="date">09-14-2007, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can guarantee you most of the people on my friends list are girls. Not because I hit on them or anything, but because I have an AWESOME time grouping with them. I swear the average girl on Muradin is 50x more polite and smarter (i.e better grammar, spelling, etc.) than the guys. I was with a cool group the other day, and we got into a conversation like this, and they all said they were girls. I was the only guy there. :P<br />
But that was one of the better times. We did some instances, some quests, and even just some grinding. We all had an absolute blast. :)<br />
 <br />
Oh, and 90% of those girls have male characters, though, because they don't want people to think they're girls and get hit on all the time.<br />
It's a sad, sad world.  :(</div></div><hr />
