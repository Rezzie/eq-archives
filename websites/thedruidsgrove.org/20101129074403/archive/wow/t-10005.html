I was wondering if people who have been or are around this level would post where they leveled. Good questing spots for this lvl? Good instances? Thanks a  lot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On my 52 NE Priest I did alot of instances when I could find the groups.  I believe Mara/Ulda is what I hit most (of course I was an enchanter and needed Ulda for that).  As for where to quest....I'm horrible with the area names.  Also....do you usually go solo or do you have a friend with you....that will also determine where you can quest better for leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NightTree</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the response Buttons. Ahh questing, well I would say I'm 80/20 , 80% questing with friends and 20% solo. As for the instances, well I'm too high for SM now and I have been told I am too low for ULDA (hmmm). So kinda stuck. I'm sure Ill end up figuring something out, but I thought I would post and see what ppl had to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea....never hurts to post questions.  Have you hit STV?  Feralas is another place you can go....but I would try STV first.  Tanaris is where I went some too....and did a lil bit of ZF, but you will need to gain more levels for that too. <br />
<br />
I really don't think you are too low for Ulda....just take you time and make sure you have a good group....oh yea.....try Badlands...haha!  The names are finally coming back to me....haha!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you in a guild?  If so, maybe when they are not raiding you could get some of them to help with some of the instances.  That's what my bf and I did when we couldn't find good groups for the instances....luckily we made friends with people before they hit 60 and when they had time they asked if we needed help with anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyane</div><div class="date">02-01-2006, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are probably only &quot;too low&quot; for the end of Uldaman.  I've gone through and died near the end a few times now and just hit 44.  Dragged along a friend who is a few lvls lower too and she did just fine so long as everyone could hold the aggro.  <br />
<br />
STV has some good quests and you should be able to handle most of them quite handily.  Some will give you some trouble.  Stranglethorn Fever nearly ripped us a new one.  I was unable to keep all the dirty apes off of her and she died.  I was nearly dead when she got back just in the nick of time to heal me and we finished the quest.  It was really fun though :)<br />
<br />
We have a number of more quests to finish down in STV before we move on and really take on Feralas as there are still things down there that hurt me when they exhale ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">02-02-2006, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea....remembering my Uldaman runs....it would be hard for you unless you had 2 60's with you.  STV is great....do all the quests you can because there are quite a few series quests (so if they are too low for you still work on them because they could lead to ones your level range).<br />
<br />
If you usually run with a buddy then Feralas will be ok as long as they are the same range as you are.  I usually ran with a rogue when I was on my shadow priest in this level range.  So that's what I'm thinking about.  We were both the same level....</div></div><hr />

I actually ran ULDA the other night and we made it all the way to the final boss (omg) ... lol. We wiped there but it was still fun. I think I will head to STV and check it out. Thanks again</div></div><hr />

I started in on the Northern portion in mid to high 30s, you should be able to storm thru there and complete a good number of quests pretty quickly.</div></div><hr />

Go thru the tunnel next to Stromgarde.</div></div><hr />
