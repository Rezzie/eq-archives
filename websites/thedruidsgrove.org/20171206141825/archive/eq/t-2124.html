Now i am wondering if and how Druids might be able to do it solo.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Evil Dutch</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember this guy on AB server before the movelog...he was seriously geared up..no ordinary necro could have done this. As for druids soloing VS...no, it will not happen. The spells just aren't there, and there's nothing to charm ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 04:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does VS have 18k or 32k hp?  I can never remember.<br />
<br />
What divine aura items are available to druids?  Earring of the Frozen Skull has 4 charges (1 sec cast time), Protection of the Dain has 1 charge (2.5 sec cast time), and Shiny Brass Idol has 1 charge (instant cast).  Assuming the druid can channel all the clicks, this is basically 6*3=18 ticks of invulnerability.<br />
<br />
Shield of bracken (40), brackencoat (13), frostreaver's blessing (10), kilva's skin of flame (33) combine for a  damage shield of 96.  Spirit of the wood 3 adds another 55 for 8 ticks (assume focus of mediocrity).<br />
<br />
Summon booboo, cast Wrath of the Wild 3 and shield of bracken on him.  Cast wrath of the wild on self.  Wait for button to refresh again.  Pull with hand of ro, cast fury of ro (1680 over 1.2 minutes with extended affliction IV; assume affliction haste IV as well).  Assume both land...VS isn't especially fire resistant, is he?  (Hand of ro at fire-200, fury of ro at fire-122...)<br />
<br />
Hit spirit of the wood 3, cast summer's flame (checks fire-107 at this point) for at least 1400 (more with dd focus effect), then click first DA item.  VS turns to booboo and squishes him but takes 690 damage from DS.  Assume no lifetap.<br />
<br />
VS immediately summons druid and takes another wrath of the wild for 650.  After the first DA wears off, use wrath of the wild on self again, for another 650, then click the next DA.  VS takes 151 damage per hit for the first 8 ticks, then  96 damage per hit for the rest of the fight.  Assuming 2 hits per round, 1 round every 2 seconds, that's 151 damage per second for 48 seconds, then 96 damage per second for the remaining 60 seconds.  151*48=7248, 96*60=5760.<br />
<br />
Total damage done so far, with luck:<br />
1680 (fury of ro)<br />
690 (booboo)<br />
1400 (summer's flame)<br />
1300 (2x wrath of the wild)<br />
7248 (DS for 48 seconds while spirit of wood up)<br />
5760 (DS for remaining 60 seconds)<br />
------<br />
18058<br />
<br />
So if VS has 18k hp, and fire based spells can land, then I think it might be doable. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tried to solo Cazil in Oasis of Marr last weekend... Hit him with 1 Moonfire.. he took 7% damage..(~12,000 hp?) <br />
<br />
Summoned.<br />
<br />
Then he proceded to smush me.. barly got a egress off.  That guy is only level 51 but averages ~250-300 DPS.<br />
<br />
So that means that I either stand and fight...which is not really an option with me taking that much damage, or I Root/Run away.. but There is not enough time to cast a spell before he summons me again (which interrupt spell).<br />
<br />
Still find this &quot;Soloing Summoners&quot; idea rather confusing without a pet... Now with a pet I get it.. I can solo summoning mobs in PoD easy with a rat pet... just hope charm doesn't break..</div></div><hr />

Without a true pet i cant even imagine a druid soloing a summoner like this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maody</div><div class="date">04-08-2003, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately VS is very fire resistant. We did him a few weeks ago with a group for fun and to my suprise he total and partial resisted Summers Flame alot.<br />
<br />
My first thought on soloing was max DS and invul items too. I am not much into this number crunching on everything in EQ, but how much damage does a druid approx. have to deal with assuming AC1200, lighning reflexes and innate defense maxed out? <br />
<br />
I can stand quite a while against a slowed BoT Giant, maybe getting him slowed and beeing invul when lifetap comes in is the key to succes?<br />
<br />
As far as i remember, when my guild did VS the very first time our MT had less AC and HP then i have now.<br />
<br />
Does he even try to lifetap an invul player?</div></div><hr />

This is why runes prevent his lifetap, since he never actually 'connects' for any actual player damage.  This was my observation anyway.<br />
<br />
I would think you might be able to duo him with an enchanter if we could keep agro.. rune is super agro though.  Might be able to since you can cast while runed, but not while DA'd.<br />

He is very FR.  I don't recall if CR/MR too.</div></div><hr />

But if he summons now they must have changed his level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cazel has a 150hp regan per tick I thought, the way you solo him is with Fear.  Don't think druids get fear that works on him though.  You also can negate his regan by puting a disease dot on him.  <br />
<br />
Other side notes for Cazel - Can be CoD'ed and will waste all the merchents in zone without breaking a sweat.  <br />
<br />
He has approx 10K hps as well,  4 SS (SunStrike Wizzy DD approx 2K), 6 Dementria (Sp) (Enchanter 650ish DD), and a few L54 druid nukes took him down quick.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">04-18-2003, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Disease dots don't automatically stop regen of an arbitrary amount.<br />
<br />
The only dot that, alone, would stop 150/tick of regen is one that does 150/tick of damage.<br />
<br />
This is a common misconception that most likely came about because common disease based dots at low levels happened to be exactly the same as natural standing regen (1/tick, like Rabies) or sitting regen (2/tick, like Disease).<br />
<br />
In any case, if Cazel has 10k hp and Cazel's regen is only 150/tick, then a druid that can burn for 11,500 damage in a minute would be able to kill Cazel.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if anything has changed in the two+ years since this screen shot was taken, but here are his resists.  Oh, and this is from the EQ Spoofs website I posted in the general section.</div></div><hr />

quad attacks for 400, and procs a 1500 lifetap very very often (like at least once per round of hits)<br />
and has 12,000 hp.<br />
to land any spells other than the swarm line dots, he really needs debuffing, possible with firestuff after a hand of ro tho<br />
<br />
if you pull him with hand of ro then do a fury of ro right after you've run ahead (even if it resists),i doubt a chain rune-ing enchi will steal your agro somehow</div></div><hr />

On my third try I managed to solo Cazel.  I would estimate his regen to be around 100 hp a _second_ (especially obvious now that target hp is updated every second).  This made even chain nuking with Winter's Frost impractical.  However, from my days as a monk using an adamantite bo stick, I remembered a nifty property of large mobs: Cazel's melee range is larger than my rain's radius.  So I was able to stand at near max melee range and alternate Winter's Frost with Winter's Storm without hitting myself, and without being summoned (which would interrupt a spell).  Once he started running away I had to burn him down with just Winter's Frost; each cast would do about 12% damage, but he'd regen about 8% between casts.  I finished with near full health (spirit of the wood+replenishment+nature's recovery was enough healing) and about 20% mana.</div></div><hr />

Maybe try to channel a few heals of your own to save some money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Otherwise, you're right.  In theory any class should be able to porcupine vox/naggy/faydedar/etc. given sufficient stinging wort potions. :)   (Finishing them off when they run could be an issue for certain low-damage classes I suppose, depending on regen rate.  I once was part of a 3-person attempt to take on the enchanter epic mob in Cabilis.  With the damage shield, we slowly wore him down, but once he started to run, we couldn't do enough damage, and eventually he got back to 50% health and started attacking us again.)</div></div><hr />

What you have to do is fr debuff her first and then tank her.  Just stand there chain nuking using Summers Flame while healing in between with nature's infusion.  From there just hope she starts running before you run oom :)    Make sure you have max ds going at the same time as well and if you do have dc a pet in the zone could help although I've never bothered with it.<br />

One of the biggest things that could allow you to solo him is having your mr 400+.  Helped a group out today kill him in which I tanked.  I had 450mr and half his lifetaps I resisted while the other half were partials for under 300.  His melee damage is 300 top hit and is very sporatic as he casts a lot.  Just the issue with him always healing himself that could present a problem in trying to nuke him down fast enough.<br />

I was assuming there wouldn't be enough mana to just chain nuke Gorenaire to death.  I have enough trouble doing that with Phinigel who has 16k hp, though I suppose being able to keep buffs does help. :)<br />
<br />
Is Gorenaire's melee similar to Talendor's?  I've unintentionally tanked Talendor for a full fight, so I could go back and check how well I stood up to that (though it was before CS3/ID5).  I suppose I could always bring stinging wort potions in any case, heh...</div></div><hr />
