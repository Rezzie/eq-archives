    General Changes Affecting Druids<br />
<br />
        * Spellpower<br />
              o All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spellpower. This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant “increased spell damage and healing” such as on typical Mage and Warlock itemization.<br />
              o For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording.<br />
              o Healing characters will see their bonus healing numbers on the character sheet decrease, however, all healing spells have been modified to receive more benefit from spellpower than they received from bonus healing, with a net effect of no change to the amount healed by their spells. Some talents have had to be rebalanced to accommodate this change, but the amount healed will remain roughly the same. In addition, some talents will provide only healing spell power.<br />
        * Overhealing is now reported in the combat log.<br />
        * The Warrior skill Hamstring now only has one rank and no longer causes damage.<br />
<br />
    General Druid Changes<br />

        * Improved Mark of the Wild (Restoration): Now a 2-point talent, down from a 5-point talent.<br />

        * Soothe Animal can now be used on Dragonkin as well as Beasts and is now instant cast.<br />
<br />
    Balance Changes<br />

        * Moonkin Form (Balance) no longer increases your attack power or causes you to regenerate mana off melee attacks, but now has a chance to cause you to instantly regenerate 2% of your total mana every time you critically hit with a spell.<br />

        * Nature’s Grasp (Balance): Can now be used and can proc indoors.<br />

        * Vengeance (Balance): Now also works with Starfall.<br />

<br />
        * Faerie Fire (Feral): Now an 11-point talent, down from being a 21-point talent.<br />
        * Feral Charge (Feral) is now a 21-point talent, up from being a 11-point talent.<br />
        * Feral Charge (Feral): Can now be used in Cat form.<br />
        * Feral Instinct (Feral) no longer increases threat generated in Bear form, but now increases damage done by your Swipe ability by 5/10/15%.<br />
        * Improved Faerie Fire (Feral): Now also works with spell hit, in addition to ranged and melee hit %.<br />

Also now only reduced threat for Restoration spells, and reduces the chance that your healing over time spells (Lifebloom, Regrowth and Rejuvenation) will be dispelled, rather than all Druid spells.<br />
        * Tranquil Spirit (Restoration) now also includes Nourish.<br />
        * Tree of Life (Restoration): 30% snare penalty has been removed.<br />
        * Tree of Life (Restoration): Can now cast Dispel Curse.<br />

No way it is 4% right now.  Well according to wowhead comments, it is ~3.3% in cat form and 10% in bear.  So, it is a nice boost to cat and a bit of nerf to bear.<br />
<br />
And the changes to Feral Instinct to no longer boost bear threat. Yikes.  WTF.  Maybe all bears will get a threat increase?</div></div><hr />

Not sure it OP, but it is nice.  Trees also get an out of combat rez.  That alone might make me switch to resto (healing) when I hit lvl 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lockjaw (Feral) replaced with Savage Roar:<br />
Savage Roar (Rank 1)<br />
25 Energy 100 yd range  &lt;--- What's up with everything having a 100yd range initially???<br />
Instant<br />

1 point : 9 seconds<br />
2 points: 12 seconds<br />
3 points: 15 seconds<br />
4 points: 18 seconds<br />

Does this stack?  Seems like we could have 2-3 up at once if it does.  If not, we'd have to alternate between Rip and this during PvE cycles???</div></div><hr />

This change is designed to put Protection Warriors back up at the top in terms of tanking a single mob, such as a raid boss.<br />
It also allows druids to keep our current speciality which is tanking multiple mobs with swipe spam.<br />

<br />
It's an interesting ability.  First off I would suggest that this is intended to function in a similar way to Rogue's Slice and Dice ability.  So going by that no, it will not stack.  And yes, consequently the best response would seem to be to alternate this ability with Rip.<br />
<br />
However it also opens up several new cans of worms in the process.  This ability means that attack power will have a new attractiveness to druids, perhaps intended to pull cat druids back to prioritising strength and agility equally.  Currently agility is largely the favoured stat.<br />
<br />
I will save my theorycrafting until the exact stats of the ability have been finalised, though.<br />

I have to disagree here.  They specifically stated they want all tanks to be viable in end game.  Swipe spam is ok, but Paladin &gt; Swipe like it or not. <br />
<br />
Warriors are getting a threat increase to Def stance ( going to 45% ) and we're getting a threat decrease.  Seems a bit much, while I never really had issues tanking 5 mans this could cause issues for some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another thing this change does (if we don't get a base bear threat boost) is separate Kitty from Bear talent specs even more.  As a bear, I'd pass over &quot;Rend and Tear&quot; (renamed from something else in the Alpha), but now it seems like I'd have to take it.</div></div><hr />

I hate that change.  It's hard enough pugging as a bear tank with damage meter happy mages and locks without my threat generation being nerfed.  Without that threat generation coming from somewhere else, it will just make pallies even more the pug tank of choice.<br />
<br />
It also looks like they are trying to encourage the use of Maul with the change to Mangle, which is less threat efficient currently.  What am I missing?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Since when are Prot Warriors NOT the best for tanking single targets?  Their bag of tricks is much more extensive than ours is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus there are another talents that boost maul damage, mangle damage (improved mangle) and the global damage increase from master shapeshifter (which I assume every feral will take despite having to waste points in Natural Shapeshifter [damn you Blizzard]).  So, in  the end we may end up with more threat???  But it isn't obvious from the information we have today.</div></div><hr />

Further salvation is getting overhauled so that while it will reduce threat it will also reduce healing and damage. This might have some long reaching affects.</div></div><hr />

I am seeing a trend developing, and that trend seems to indicate that Death Knights and Warriors will share the spotlight in this expansion. <br />
Did Primal Tenacity get better or worst?  I never took it before (% seemed too low), but now it seems even weaker.  Just as well, I don't have the talent points to spend any longer.<br />
It's definitely worse now. Only reason I had it before was for the pvp prowl bonus, and the extra threat was gravy for pve. Now it's a very easy talent to skip getting.<br />
<br />
I'm really not seeing the love that ferals need. They are fixing **** that should have been in the game on release (using pots in forms/weapon fury/weapon proc enchants), and all the ferals are in the streets dancing and drinking wine like it was water. But those changes don't even balance us with the current classes, let alone the new wotlk stuff. And the wotlk feral stuff doesn't blow me away like it should.</div></div><hr />

As a bear I don't think we got one new skill.  Imp Mangle (which seems very weak) and Master Shapeshifter are the only real improvements for bear.  But they could just offset the loses from the change to Primal Instinct.<br />
<br />
The two things all Druids have to be happy with is that we now have a so-so (it can break itself) CC for 5-mans regardless of our primary role (tank, melee dps, healer, caster) and an OoC Rez.</div></div><hr />

Bear seems to have zero real changes.  Kitty seems to have gotten a big boost (especially in PvP) and Resto (for PvE) seems great.  I haven't followed the moonkin changes, so I can't comment on those.<br />
<br />
I wonder if Blizzard is pushing the Druid back into a healer role since the stupid DK will be a tanking class.  The changes to resto certainly seem to boost 5-man skills as well.  Making it a bit easier for someone to pickup/learn the skills.  I just might switch to resto once I hit 80.  Someone is going to have to heal all those DKs running around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The feral changes for kitty are amazing!!!!  They actually made Tiger's Fury useful. I smack it every time the damned cooldown is up.  Its kind of like Adreneline Rush now.  So you get huge amounts of energy all at once.  So you drain your energy down, smack it, keep pounding out abilities.  With the %increase in AP to Feral staffs, I'm doing some hefty damage.  I'd say easily a 20-30% increase in DPS just by feel.</div></div><hr />

But it sort of seems like they may have weakened, or at least stagnated, bear tanking.  That is just from looking at the talent tree.  Maybe there are other changes not reflected in the tree that make up for the apparent unbearable changes in the Feral tree.:grin:</div></div><hr />

Thus far I'm not seeing a wealth of what I'd deem Feral druid gear.  Maybe I'm missing something in the way the talents have reitemized druids, but its all rogue gear.  There is a very nice staff for people who haven't gotten the badge gear, but overall, the gear has been Meh... but I'm in a mix of badge gear, Kara, ZA and T5.  So I don't expect to see upgrades till the next zone or two.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to comment on quest rewards about that, but its all rogue gear thus far.  The new druid staffs are nice for new druids.  It gives you a very  nice boost, but still won't over take the purple ones you get yet in Outland.  By 62-64 I think I'll seriously have to start looking for upgrades.  If I get into a dungeon group tonight I may have to really look at the gear that drops.  <br />
<br />
Its been ages, but does haste do squat for druids?  I thought haste only helped lower your attack speed for melee and we already have the lowest attack speed you can get.

<br />
Yeah, haste doesn't do crap for Cat form except lower your attack speed which is already at 1.0 (yes you can have a sub 1s attack speed).<br />
<br />
For bears, I would think haste would be nice to help generate extra threat and reduce th GCD.</div></div><hr />

I also talked to a Feral in beta who said that Infected Wounds does (http://wowthinktank.blogspot.com/2008/07/druid-what-gear-to-get-for-wotlk.html?showComment=1217011860000#c869894760357  0895780) work on bosses.
