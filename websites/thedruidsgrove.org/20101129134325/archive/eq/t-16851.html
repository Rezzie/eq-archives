Korea.<br />
<br />
But as a Republican, if I got disgusted and wanted to leave, what country is more &quot;Republican&quot; than the US?  <br />
<br />
In some ways I'd think China would be a good fit except for that whole communist thing, but they haven't gotten around to regulating business yet (much).  Republicans would love that.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure where the intellectual conservatives would go.  David Brooks might have to take up residence next to William F. Buckley, Jr's grave.<br />
<br />
It would take a lot to goad me into moving abroad in the near future.  I worry a lot less about the size of government than I do about how invasive it is.  For instance, it wouldn't bother me to pay higher taxes for things like nationalized health care or higher education but expansion of the PATRIOT act or similar authoritarian infringements on our civil liberties would worry me greatly.  <br />
<br />
That said, if the sh1t really hit the fan, I'd move to Australia (http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=ohut50&amp;s=4) and keep Canada as a backup country.</div></div><hr />

For kicks I would say Mexico, you know a country that was always about to go up and up, until rampant political corruption to slap down your countrymen, because of all the crazy things they could get away with.<br />
<br />
For myself though, I might actually enjoy many of the different cultures out there, so, I would probably settle for a less invasive government.</div></div><hr />

By sheer coincidence I stumbled upon one answer to your question.  If you read this thread  (http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2102408/posts)on Free Republic (don't read after you've just eaten) you'll see that some of the posters are suggesting that succession would be a possibility.</div></div><hr />

Republicans would have their work cut out for them if they're looking for a country where abortion is illegal, the government isn't left-leaning, the gun laws are nonrestrictive, and their neighbors are social conservatives.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panamah</div><div class="date">10-10-2008, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh right, I forgot about Dubai.  But they'd probably feel pretty stymied unless they were Muslim.  And we know how Republicans often feel about Muslims.<br />
<br />
Hong Kong... part of China, a communist country.  Republicans usually equate communism with satanism.<br />
<br />
Singapore, isn't that a pretty tightly regulated place?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamion</div><div class="date">10-10-2008, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hong Kong was a British colony til 1997 and is now a special administrative district of China, which is similar to what we call a territory.  Its economic policies are separate from those of China's -- they don't even use the same currency.  It is often regarded as the closest thing to a true free market in the world; very easy to start a business there, lax labor laws, absurdly low taxes, as many 'free trade' laws as possible, etc.  Hong Kong is known for its efficient court system and extremely low corruption.  The most anti-free market aspect of Hong Kong is that the government owns virtually all of the land; most land in Hong Kong is leased from the government.<br />
<br />
Singapore's economic policies are similar to Hong Kong, but the government there is extremely strict when it comes to social policies.  Singapore was also a British colony until a few decades ago.<br />
<br />
What makes Singapore and Hong Kong so unique to the region was their colonial rule.  They were essetially British controlled ports and not much else; the British kept the peace, ran the port, and ran courts, but generally allowed the people to do whatever they wanted to, so entrepreneurs were allowed to prosper.  <br />
<br />
Conservative think tanks constantly rate Hong Kong and Singapore quite high on the index of economic freedom:<br />

Where can Republicans threaten to move if Obama wins? (http://www.slate.com/id/2202070/)<br />
<br />
Ok, this one crossed my mind and apparently theirs too:  Israel.  They also suggest Poland and Cayman Islands.  Runners up were: Switzerland, Singapore and Hong Kong.</div></div><hr />
