The short answer is &quot;no&quot; but thats kinda deceptive as there are &quot;some&quot; advantages to Wood Elves and Halflings that I believe Human and Half Elf don't get. (And if I'm wrong please correct me with out flaming me so others will have the correct information)<br />
 <br />
Woof Elf<br />
-Innate Hide (Useful at higher levels to break charm freeing a spell gem or finding a clicky)<br />
-Fletching/Tailoring (Although Fletching isn't useful to us as a class if your an aspiring artisan it makes life alot easier.  Aslo we have one of the better DoN Tailoring skill up routes)<br />
 <br />
Halfling(Karana Deity)<br />
-Inate Hide(read above)<br />
-Harvest Sacks (100% W/R bags that Halflings can only make!!!  Good source of money when your skill is sufficient.)<br />
-Fletching(Read above)<br />
-10% xp bonus(Not sure if this was removed with the TSS expansion but if not another reason to be a &quot;furry feet&quot;)<br />
 <br />
Drakkin<br />
*** Don't own expansion so not sure of all there innate skills ***<br />
-Breath Weapon(For those druids who want a free DPS in groups, but not even sure what kinda damage it does LOL.)</div></div><hr />

I am newly made drakkin druid of the 23rd season. The Breath Weapon is very nice and has about a 5 minute refresh at level 4 (the level I am now or shaould I have 5??) it has a direct damage portion of 28hp and 15hp per tic dot (4 or 5 ticks I can't remember). Considering I only have 2 dots at that level 32hp and 5hp it is a very nice addition.<br />
 <br />
I also has a resist debuff depending on your starting dragons colour (druids can be green (poison?) and blue(cold?).</div></div><hr />

Drakkin attacks are based on color Green is Poison, Blue is Magic. The debuff is associated with the attack, thus green lowers poison resist and blue lowers magic. I have a Drakkin Rogue that is from the Black Dragon. It's attack is disease as is the associated debuff. I do find them fun to play.<br />
<br />
A word of caution on the breath attack. It is an area attack. So if you only want it to affect a single critter, make sure there are no others around (I've called unwanted attention to myself on several occasions). It's useful though when you're being mobbed by a small group of critters close to your level. As you pick them off one by one they all have some amount of damage already.<br />

A fairly good list, but missing one skill of halflings that I find to be a HUGE boon.<br />
<br />
Sneak. With this roguish handshake, you have magical faction.<br />

Pick something you'll be happy looking at, since race beyond some innate abilities doesn't really matter.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suva</div><div class="date">12-14-2006, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I picked a half elf based off 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1. My first druid was a halfling.  I fell in the water less than 5 minutes after making her and drowned because I had no idea how to swim. I decided I didn't like that starting city full of water.  This was when I was a true newbie to EQ and didn't know things like adjusting the gamma so I could have seen the water.<br />
<br />
2. I was warned if I made a wood elf I would fall out of trees and die a lot.  That did not sound fun.<br />
<br />
3. I'm already human, so didn't want my fantasy game character to be what I already was.<br />
<br />
This left me with a half elf starting in a city I had basic understanding of.</div></div><hr />

/comforts, most RL girls in EQ with at least a semi-sweet personality get that regardless of race they choose. But, yea I am sure Half Elf is much worse than others.</div></div><hr />

Oh I hear you about this one! I have sacrificed stats in order to keep the chain armor look. I currently wear a Fabled Fungus Covered Scale Tunic, and Elder Spiritist's Greaves, and while I could easily procure better tunic and leggings for myself (I turned down several leggings pattern for TSS armor), I've decided my satisfaction with the way my character looks is more important than the stats I'm missing out on.  <br />
<br />
I made a half elf back in the fall of 2000, and when Velious was released I was thrilled with the different armor textures that were available.  I really liked the looks we had open to us and I was so sad when Luclin came available and the new character models stuck us in that awful leather get up. <br />
<br />
Despite this self-imposed handicap I don't think I've done too poorly for myself equipment-wise considering I'm in a very small family type guild and don't raid often. http://eq.magelo.com/profile/74290</div></div><hr />

She is my main, a TSer and the decision was based on the variety of human classes.  DoN armor is still pretty good and she is able to make it for all of my alts.  She is a Master Artisan, the fletching to 300 for humans is very easy with cultural combines.</div></div><hr />
