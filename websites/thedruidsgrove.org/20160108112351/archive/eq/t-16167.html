<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">marikus</div><div class="date">08-06-2007, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've recently decided that I want to try and get to 70 with my druid (mostly for reptile at 68) and have never levelled past 65 with any character.  My druid has pretty miserable stats, (238 wis, 3500 or so mana, etc).<br />
<br />
What should I be making my target to solo?  I've seen people mention noble's causeway for lower levels, but would it be worthwhile at 65?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Back at my time I did Monster Missions when it was very hot.</div></div><hr />

Anyone translate for me?<br />

&quot;harbingers spire off Ds or NC&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;rcod&quot;<br />

&quot;regversion of the nest killing the drakes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HoH basement&quot;<br />
<br />
I have every expansion, but dont know my way around just yet. I actually went and duoed with a friend through some of old HS last night just to get my feet wet. Minor exps and not worth the effort but was a good indoor relearning exps.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am in the same boat, good gear for the beginnings of PoP, but out of practice and need to catch up to my friends that are all 75-80 soon.</div></div><hr />

NC = Nobles' Causeway another zone off of Dranik Scar, I'm partial to NC, more kiting room then again I didn't spend much time in Harbringers.<br />
<br />
RCoD= Ruined City of Dranik, this is off of the Bloodfields which we get a port to at level 66 I believe if you cant port there you will go through Dranik Scar-&gt;Bloodfields-&gt;RCoD again.<br />
 <br />
Regular version of the nest means the static version, ie it isn't an instanced zone just a normal one.<br />
<br />
HoH basement = 1 of 3 basement areas in Halls of Honor off of Plane of Tranquility.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ligge</div><div class="date">04-15-2008, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I found a great place in Steppes that you can charm the lt blue snakes and lizards at 65/66 and send them after each other and after the spiders. They are back by the spider caves.<br />
<br />
It was a great place to practice as they arent socialable so no adds and with myself and another druid we were tearing through stuff with 2 pets and 2-4 mobs at a time.<br />
<br />
Only risk on the multiple mob issue is unless you have the upgraded charm (she does) you have to charm the light blues only. So solo its an easy task to pick those out of the crowd and send them against the blues/whites - with some help your lower pet can kill them and then camo on and kill pet.<br />
<br />
We did this for hours last night with no downtime at all. I was nuking to my hearts content just so I could get a med break every once in a while.</div></div><hr />

It's may not be the best xp out there but as your faction improves you get some good armor, prob better that what you got atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">freakyflow</div><div class="date">06-17-2008, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi I am also an old player returning back for some new adventures. I haven't played since the GoD expansion. I am in the same boat as the OP. People have mentioned a few zones to go venture from reading posts. But where in the zone and what type of mobs should I go tackle? I don't want to go hit up a mob and start getting summoned and get beaten to a pulp. Any tips would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damas</div><div class="date">06-18-2008, 02:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should try the hotzones for the obvious reason of the xp bonus but since the hotzones usually have ppl there you should have a good chance at a group if you dont feel like soloing.</div></div><hr />
