<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xitix</div><div class="date">06-03-2003, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the [KeyMaps] section of eqclient.ini add a line for this if you haven't already. You can bind it to any key you wish. I use y because it's close to r which is the default binding for reply. For some reason it has no default binding *and* it's not even available under keyboard options in the client. <br />
<br />
So what does it do?<br />
Press the hotkey and up comes /rtarget &lt;name&gt; and using TAB and shift-TAB cycles through the last people to send you tells. Press BACKSPACE then ENTER to target that person if they are close enough. An example I get a tell for group haste, I hit Y, backspace, enter and ALT-2 to cast the spell. Makes responding to buff requests very fast and easy. <br />
<br />
Whats sorta broke?<br />
Two things. It's not listed under options in the client and that darn BACKSPACE you need to press. It put a space after the persons name just like the reply hotkey does which causes the target to fail. Have to delete the space each time before pressing enter.<br />
<br />
Anybody else still use this besides me? Would be nice to get it fixed and get more people using it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a hotkey with<br />
/rt<br />
/pause 2<br />
/cast 3<br />
/pause 2<br />
/tt Nine incoming!<br />
<br />
This targets the last person to send me a tell, casts the buff on them, and sends them a tell to let them know it is on the way - all with the push of a single button.  (I keep Protection of Nine in slot 3).  <br />
<br />
The only time it doesnt work is when someone else sends me a tell faster than I can hit the button.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What other commands are not listed that work with KEYMAP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xitix</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RTarget is a specific command and I don't think there are any other hidden commands like it. This one was advertised in a patch message before the new UI it just seemed to drop off the radar after that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what the question was.  <br />
<br />
Was it that you want to bind /rt to a single button &quot;y&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Seemed more to me like he was pointing out that it should be listed in keyboard options as well as pointing out the fact that it doens't quite work right..</div></div><hr />
