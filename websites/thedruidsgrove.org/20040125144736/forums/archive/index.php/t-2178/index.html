Shattered Seal of Warding (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15648)<br />
<br />
I looted one and hubby looted one and they ID differently.  His says &quot;These unbreakable Seals&quot; and mine says &quot;Lies a Power Corrupt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Is it a sub quest for Emp key?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Teaa</div></div><hr />

<br />
From memory these are just meant to be titbits of info to help you solve the quest for the Ring of the Shissar.<br />
<br />
Have to admit tho that I never really paid much attention to TM's loot (or lack of :) ), other than whether a pouch dropped or not :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is to add to your godly Druidess skills of course  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stormhaven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, originally they were for making the key into the Emp's room.  Now they're just No Drop / Destroy fodder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oaky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">afaik they have no other purpose than understanding how to start the Cursed cycle: loot them, identify them, re-order the puzzle, and understand that you actually have to kill all 10 taskmasters within 1 hour to spawn the glyph covered serpent, start of the Cursed cycle</div></div><hr />
