<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">11-26-2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As of the 3.0.8 patch, this quest is optional.  You can still do it if you'd like, or you can learn Aquatic Form from any druid trainer at level 16.<br />
<br />
This quest is from the same NPC as the first two druid quests, Mathrengyl Bearwalker in Darnassus, and can be started at level 16.<br />
        <br />
Mathrengyl yet again sends you to Dendrite Starblaze in Moonglade. Dendrite will first ask you to find a bauble at the bottom of Lake Elune'Ara, and then take it to the Shrine of Remulos and use it. The bauble doesn't actually look like a bauble ... it's more like a wooden block (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=154) or something. It's also a bit hard to see, you'll have a 30 minute time limit, and may be competing against other druids looking for it. Having fun yet? :)  Be sure to look in the deeper parts of the lake, where the bottom slopes down into little hollows.  (You can see the locations of the Shrine and Dendrite on the Moonglade map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=153).)<br />
        <br />
After finding and using the bauble, talk to Tajarri by the shrine. She'll send you to find the two halves of the Pendant of the Sea Lion, and tell you to ask townsfolk in Nighthaven for clues. The two griffon masters will each tell you the location of one of the half-pendants.<br />
        <br />
The first part, Half Pendant of Aquatic Agility, can be found in Darkshore. See the Darkshore map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=142) for its location (the glowing dot). The box containing the pendant is between the northernmost two fangs. You'll probably have to fight a couple level 17-18 threshers, but this half is overall pretty easy.  (If you're using a map addon, the loc is 49,11.)<br />
        <br />
The second part, Half Pendant of Aquatic Endurance, is in Westfall, and a bit trickier to get to.  Swim out into the water near the location marked on the map, and be sure to watch out for the reef sharks that can be swimming nearby.  Eventually, you'll find a ledge with a bubbly fissure that will allow you to catch your breath (it's also just inside the fatigue area).  The pendant is in a chest right next to the fissue, as noted by the Westfall map (http://www.thedruidsgrove.org/wow/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=141).  (If you're using a map addon, the loc is 18,33.)  Ignore the ship; the pendant used to be near it, but no longer.<br />
        <br />
With both halves of the pendant in hand, head back to the Shrine of Remulos and use one of the halves to combine them. Take the completed pendant back to Dendrite, and then back to Mathrengyl in Darnassus. He'll give you aquatic form and a pretty nifty belt (http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=16608)!<br />

I added a couple more images, to match the Horde walkthrough.  It should now be up to date and correct as of December 31, 2005.  Thanks to Sobe for adding the picture of the fissure and Sobe and Stormhaven for updating the quest info! -Yrys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Amerylla</div><div class="date">11-28-2004, 01:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished this quest tonight.  I would just stress one thing.  Make sure you hit the fissue on the way down, if you don't it is likely you won't make it.  You need to get right next to it and it resets fatigue and breath.  I missed it the first time and died right as I got to the chest.  I also learned something interesting doing this.  As a dead person you don't need to worry about breath (obviously) but you *do* continue to take fatigue.  I was far enough away from my corpse on top of the water that I did not have the option to rez until I was right down at my corpse, but then I had full fatigue once more.  There was no way to accept the rez and get back out, I was dead by the time I got there.  I would suspect that the fissue would have solved this, but perhaps not, went ahead and took the hit.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to be so long winded but the moral is don't neglect visiting the fissure, and fatigue is still a problem when you are dead..=)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yrys</div><div class="date">11-29-2004, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a long run.  Take the boat to Menethil, then run east, south, southwest across Wetlands (this is pretty tricky at 16, but doable if you're careful) to Loch Modan, then slightly south to the crossroads, northwest to Dun Morogh, then mostly west to Ironforge, then take the tram to Stormwind, then Elwynn, then Westfall.  You might also want to grab flight points as you go along.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormhaven</div><div class="date">12-03-2004, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished up this quest yesterday and wanted to add a couple of things.  I got a loc for the fissure, but not one for the chest (sorry).  I'll add that when I get home, it's on a screenshot.  One thing to note, the fissure is pretty small, and it's very, very deep under the ocean.  It's not quite the bottom of the ocean, there's lots of valleys under the water - the fissure was located more along the top of a lip rather than the bottom of the valley.  You'll also get a &quot;popup&quot; if you mouse over the proper fissure - it should say something like &quot;bubbly fissure&quot;.  There are no mobs in this part of the ocean.<br />
<br />
I had a priest along with me, so I wasn't too concerned about dying.  <br />
<br />
Like Yrys said, what you're looking for is a huge boat (like the ocean crossers).  Staring out to the west, the boat should be directly down and on your left (south) if you're at the fissure.  The boat looks like a crash, the front of the boat is inside of the valley wall and the back is kind of tilted a bit more upwards.  The chest is towards the back of the boat and looks like one of the lockboxes, not a full sized &quot;battered chest&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you're swimming at normal speed and no breathing enhancers, you cannot make it from the fissure to the box, unlock the box, and back to the fissure.  However, you should be able to swim close enough to the fissure that if you have a rez'er, they can reach and rez you (apparently priests cannot rez while fatigued, so they have to be able to rez you from the &quot;protection&quot; of the fissure or other non-fatigue water spots).  You can't take more than about three &quot;ticks&quot; of drowning damage - it's a lot like the old EQ drowning - fast and deadly.  Best bet is to loot the chest and TP:Moonglade or have some of the alchemy swim+breathing potions on you.<br />
<br />
I believe the pendants were 750xp and then the spell awarding itself was 1150xp.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for all the tips, should be a breeze now.

Also I find better to loot the neclage and port to the Moonglade (you can take a few dommage from drowning) that trying to swimm back to the bubbles and you need to go to the Moonglade anyway to finish this quest.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">12-06-2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a quest in Darkshore for EB(waterbreathing) potions and I got swimming speed potions from somewhere (guildmate I think).  They will give you peace of mind but don't help much since they don't stop fatigue and that is what kills you.  The swim speed potions help more than the EB in that it gets you to the chest faster and gives you more time to teleport out.   If you swim along the edge of the dropoff at a level where you don't get the breathing bar you can swim all day till you find the anchor since there are no hostile monsters. (Edit: There are two hostile sharks that patrol the edge of the dropoff but shouldn't agro if you keep your distance).  The clam is due west of the anchor and is a small white dot on the bottom.   Swim straight to there.  When you are ready, use the swimspeed potion if you have it (only last less than a minute and long cookdown like the SoW(runspeed) potions.  The Box is on the other side closer to the stern (back end) of the boat.  If you swim right over the middle of the boat behind the mast you should be right on top of it.   Preset any hotkeys before you do this so you have teleport Moonglade as a hotkey you can hit once you loot.   Good luck and happy swimming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Artobro</div><div class="date">12-09-2004, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the great details.  I completed this quest today.  It probably took me 3 and half hours total.  About one hour to get to the claw sticking up over on Darkshore - I died once when I got jumped by 2 elder thrashers.  The other part took me about 2 and half hours.  It was a long haul from Auberdine to Westfall.  Its possible to do this at level 16.  There are some higher level mobs on the sides of the road in a few places, mostly they were level 20-22 so they aren't going to kill you in one hit.  Just keep running and they'll eventually go away.  I also ran into some Orcs guarding a couple of the tunnels you have to walk through.  I just kept on running and they gave up.  It took me two deaths before I finally found the box on the other side of the sunken ship.  As someone mentioned earlier, get your teleport spell handy and use it as soon as you loot the pendant.  You're not going to make it back to the bubble fissure.<br />
<br />
This was a very fun quest to do, but I'm a little disappointed with the seacow.  I was under the assumption that you would be able to use your feral abilities for combat underwater.  I was obviously wrong about that one because when I tried some underwater combat for the first time in seacow form, I got punked.  Its a pretty gimpy form to use for combat, but its nice to have if you want to speed up travel and there is some water nearby.</div></div><hr />

You saved me tons of time trying to find each piece, and I was able to do the first part with no death, and the 2nd part with only 1 death.  I died right beside the box by the ship, so finding it the 2nd time was easy - I just followed my corpse and dived only when I was on top of it so I didn't run out of breath :)<br />

<br />
Just go to the deepest parts of the lake (you can tell where this is by the color on your map) and start swimming around near the bottom.  You'll find it in about 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

The lore that goes along with the quests mentions something about endurance, and the swim to that quest really did take some endurance.  Actually that is still one of my favorite quests to date.  It wasn't easy, I had a blast doing it.  Wish they had quests like that for the other forms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weeser</div><div class="date">12-25-2004, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just did this quest and the change has made it very easy especially if you have a water breathing potion or a handy dandy warlock to cast waterbreathing spell on you. The map location in thread is great look for the island thing swim to the right of it until you see dark blue shelf line approaching watch out for school of reef sharks that wander easy to stay away from just be aware of them. <br />
Look for big anchor just before sea shelf drops off swim straight off drop in front of anchor you'll see the bubbly fissure ahead of you, you aren't in fatique area you won't even need to use fissure to breath if you have potion or spell big chest sitting right next to fissure open it teleport out ... I still had 6 minutes of a 10 minute breathing spell on me when I landed in Moonglade.</div></div><hr />

You cannot see it unless you dive.    I have done this with 3 different druids (beta, PvP and non-PvP) and it was in different spots each time but still in the same general area.   A map of this area and its spot might be a good link to add to the map links.</div></div><hr />

It is not directly next the the bubbly fissure. I was expecting this portin of the quest to be much more difficult. You can see the sunken ship at the bottom and I imagine it would have been much trickier before they made the change. The maps and descriptions helped a ton. Thanks =)</div></div><hr />

I had a brilliant time completing this quest though, espcially as I hadn't ventured out of Darkshore before this. Luckily I had a Gnome mage and two other friends to help along the way.<br />

I shall be swimming around the Darkshore coast on the Stormrage  realm (EU) tonight giving it a try. I'm really enjoying playing my Druid :)</div></div><hr />

This really was a pretty fun quest, especially the part in Westfall... It really felt like I was swimming to the bottom of the Pacific, it was so deep.  Was kinda neat just sitting there on the Bubbly Fissue 500 feet below water surface, chilling out.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ayehateyew</div><div class="date">02-24-2005, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a little swim out of Darkshore yesterday, headed North and kept going. I figured I might as well explore so I swam around the coast, all the way round the other side, every now and again getting out to try and climb over the mountains, but never quite making it (devious, they are).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, once I got opposite (looks on the map) IceThistle Hills I came up against some Level ?? beasties blocking my path. I tried to walk it along the coast, but they were crawling up there too. I didn't fancy being lunch so I hearthstoned out of there - frustrating to have swum so far but fun anyway.<br />
<br />
I might try going South later today and see what's there - still new to the game so it's fun to find new places :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could not find in any of the patch notes where it was changed, though I may have overlooked it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the chest with the second half is now located right next to the fissure (as mentioned above by fooey) and you no longer have to swim into deep water to find it.<br />
<br />
Locate the anchor next to the big dead fish on the coast of Westfall, swim roughly NW from there and look for the anchor on the bottom.<br />
<br />
Get a good breath, swim down to the anchor then over the egde of the ridge toward the deep water (stay out of the deep water) and you will soon see a fissure on a lip near the deep water. A box is next to the fissure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragner</div><div class="date">03-02-2005, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things about the timed Bauble part.  You can fail with the creation so do not goof off.  I went to the deep sea found the bauble and had a ton of time so I goofed around til like 5 minutes left.  I got to the temple area(or whatever that was) and right clicked and it FAILED and I lost the bauble.  I had to run to the lake and fortunelty I found another bauble very close to the shore near the temple and ran back and completed in time.  So I know for a fact that there are atleast 2 spots that the bauble spawns and that you can fail.<br />
<br />
Aquatic form is great, I love hunting in Lakeshie Lake - noone bothers you down there and the Murlocs drop really good loot - I often get 6 drops off of 1 murloc there.  I made 1gp an hour there several times.  My standard practice was swim to range in Walrus form then Shapeshift and Moon/Fiery then switch to Cat for the kill.  If they run then shapeshift and moon for kill.  Loot and heal if needed and shapeshift to walrus and repeat.  Very easy.  Traveling by water in almost all the zones is the safest way to travel anyways.  We also outswim just about anything and border zones like Duskwood are 10000% safer traveling by water then any other way.</div></div><hr />

swim from Menethil Harbor, after getting lost and dead trying to run to Westfall I swam the shoreline, there were no monsters, nothing to fight, it took maybe 40 minutes, there are very few places to get out of the water, no way to get inland until you pass the city of Stormwind and reach the shore of Westfall, there you can get our, but watch for the beasties, find the flight master, etc.<br />
<br />
I started just south of the Gold Coast Quary and swam out to the edge, then north to the anchor, the bubbler and chest were down the clif face, a few feet north of the anchor. You could easly do this without an EB potion.<br />
<br />
You should not ever see the fatuge bar, if you do you are too far from shore. that holds for the swim south and the final swim for the chest.<br />
<br />
Once I decided to swim this was an easy to do quest, with two new flight masters found.</div></div><hr />

The only remaining reason some people find this quest difficult is that they do not have the IF flightpath. Running from Menethil Harbor to Loch Moden at level 16, while actually fairly safe, looks scary.  If you already have the IF flightpath this quest is now easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly,<br />
<br />
I started the quest with those darn baubles and I kept finding a bauble holder shining red. I'd click on it and the red color would go away but I wouldn't see anything in my inventory. Is this what I'm looking for? Once the red goes away should I run like crazy? :P<br />
<br />
Secondly,<br />
<br />
Obviously I failed the quest. I've talked to everyone that was involved with the quest and was not able to resume it. I abandoned the quest and talked to the Druid trainer in Darnassus that originally gave me the quest. Still nothing. I contacted a GM and after much searching of course the only information they could give me was that this was not the person I need to speak to. So I'm now also stuck with not being able to try the quest again. <br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm new to WoW and admit not quite used to quests like this but more used to kill umpteen amount of creatures to get said item :P Thank you so much :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, thanks for this great guide. If anyone has any trouble finding the exact point for the Westfall piece, I advise using the bends in the road and the lines coming out of the drawn compass as a guideline. I did so using the image so graciously provided and found it.<br />
<br />
But I didn't have any trouble with breath or fatigue, curiously. I can't even recall seeing my fatigue meter, but there was the magic bubbles with the box, oddly enough. I think there's more of a breath issue in the lake for me.<br />
<br />
My biggest piece of advice is when pursuing the Darkshore piece, be mindful of any patrolling Threshers. The box is located between the two rocks (or at least was for me) and I had a path cleared to it only to be double teamed by a planned combat and a patroller. Just...heads up. Love the guide.<br />
<br />
Also, try to get as much exploration done when you run to Westfall. I did the entire run and managed to get over halfway from 16 to 17 not counting any other xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A warlock already there could summon you in as well.<br />
<br />
Another tactic while the lunar festival is on is get the invitation, then teleport into Moonglade using our spell, then run to where all the moonbeams are down in the field and use the invitation in the one going to Stormwind.  (You could also use the invitation in Darnassus to get to Moonglade, but then you'd have to wait around for 8 minutes while the cooldown resets.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you need to catch the boat from Auberdine to Menethil Harbor run through the Wetlands up to IF (you will probably die once or twice the aggro radius on some of the mobs is huge at that level), then catch the Tram down to SW.</div></div><hr />

I did this quest last night at 16 and this guide proved invaluable. I would never have found the pendant halves without it. All the info still seems accurate except that the first pendant (by Darkshore) now has some level 18 beasties around it.<br />
<br />
I got to Westfall by swimming along the coast (seemed appropriate for the quest). The only place I found where it was possible to come ashore was just below Stormwind where I took time out to aquaint myself with the major cities of the land of men.<br />

All in all this was a really great quest. Not sure how much actual use aquatic form is going to be, but getting it was fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I have done already, is wandered around a lot. By doing this, I've got flightpaths from pretty much everywhere in here to everywhere else I now need to go.<br />
<br />
So I would suggest that people try this, and fly between the various places (apart from Auberdine to Westfall, which involves a boat to Menethil Harbour and a flight from there to Sentinel Hill). Not only will this speed things up, you're very unlikely to get killed (unless you jump off the gryff).<br />
<br />
But this is a splendid guide which I will be putting to the test tomorrow!</div></div><hr />

<br />
One small thing, though, which is probably because I'm an idiot - I used the shiny bauble in the wrong place (not completely inside the boundaries of the Temple) and it disappeared. So I had to go back into the lake to get another bauble (there's one in the first small circular part of the lake to the East of the Temple).<br />
<br />
But yeah, got to everywhere fairly quickly after that.<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

I completed the quest with no serious problems. Just a little story for u. I started this quest as a 16. Started searching for the bauble, looked @ the time and had to go to work. I logged out. Well, I got out of work and logged back hoping to continue and found a failed quest. Sorry I am a newbie, can't u tell. In order to resume this quest I had to abandon it and speak to Dendrite in Moonglade again. I got lucky. To Yrys, THANK U SOOOOOOO MUCH. Your plan + maps laid the icing on the cake. To Aidan, u were right it was dab smack in the middle, only i came from the north. I was done with the bauble quest in less than 7 minutes. Most of the time is getting it back to the temple. Just want to let u guys know about the 1st piece in Darkshore. It was guarded by 6-8 Elder Thrashers, pull one at a time if needed, u don't have to kill all of them u know... For me, it was easier to stay on top of the water directly above the chest and pull the elder thrasher that seemed to be guarding the chest. Make him come to u. Remember that entangling roots still works in the water.. Once he is gone, u can easily drop down to ur chest and move on to the next chest. As for the 2nd piece in Westfall, That level 20 (Elite) Shark was waiting off the reef and he looked hungry. A warlock put a 10 minute water breathing spell on me. I think I used 4-6 minutes of it. The chest IS still right next to the fissure. I do recomend TP back to Moonglade once u have the piece. Once I completed my quest, I leveled, it was sweet.....<br />

Lastly, I want to thank everyone for their part in helping us newbies in getting to where u r now. I took everyone's advice and it worked out great.<br />

Thanks, great guide.<br />

When I did this quest today I found the first pandant piece ridiculously hard to get (the Westfalls one) it took me more than 2 hours to reach Westfalls and another to get the pendant.The second one at Claw Rock however took me five minutes. There were no Threshers to be seen anywhere near the rock except one Level 12 which died straight away. Am I just lucky here?</div></div><hr />

While I was there I completed a separate quest. I believe something &quot;..Gyromast..&quot;  You have to collect a few things and then kill an elite 20 something robot. At the end you get some silver and 5 water breathing potions. Perfect to keep with you on your trip to Westfall and your long swim.</div></div><hr />

it took me sooo long to finish cuase i could get no help other than &quot;yeah its in darkshore and westfall, go find it for your self noob hahaha&quot; so i went to the net hoping to find a guide like this...i found one but not half as good as this. becuase of the frustration/mean people and all it took me 2 days (not nonstop) to get this over with. after that i vowed to never let another &quot;noob&quot; druid have the same problems as me. ive now walked 4 people through this quest but its a looong journey for me since ive already done it and have flight paths!! now i just send them here and they all have thanked me for making it so easy but the reall thanks go to you guys such an awesome job!!</div></div><hr />

Didn't have to go deep/swim fast or anything. I opened it while sitting in the fissure with all the time in the world.  :texla:</div></div><hr />

It's cheap and effective. I say two because there's a chance you'll run into the 22+ elite &quot;Reef Sharks&quot; while trying to get the second half of the pendant, and if it nails you you'll loose the potion's effect.<br />

I found this quest to be easy after reading this post and getting the x,y cords correct. The only really annoying part is all the running around you have to do. Watch out for the reef shark, look for the anchor in Westfall. The co-ords are incorrect if you're checking the first few posts on thottbot. If you can't afford a water breathing potion, follow the cords and turn up your terain and draw distances so you can see the anchor from the surface and watch out for the damned shark!</div></div><hr />
