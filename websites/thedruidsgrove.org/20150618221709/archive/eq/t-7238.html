<br />
I've read in multiple threads posted by 60+ druids that summoning mobs are no biggie to solo.  I was wondering, as a new Heirophant, if you could throw out some strategies to use when soloing summoning mobs (at the moment I can't think of a way to keep myself alive long enough to drop your typical summoner).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />

If the mob is rootable just keep it rooted, so when it summons you it'll hit you a couple times and then you just back away from it.  Between summons you cast DoTs and heal yourself.  Another strategy is to just sit there and tank the mob.  Obviously this requires decent gear though.  Finally with a charmed pet the tactics should be pretty self explanatory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they don't hit very hard (I self buff to just under 4k hps) - I'll ds tank them, nuke, back away to heal if I must.  Root applied at all times<br />
<br />
If they Hit harder, I root and lay 2 dots on first (normally can land the second one before I get summoned), back up, Nuke, get summoned, back up, nuke, get summoned, back up, heal or nuke, repeat.  Root applied at all times. If my mana is &lt;45% and they still have over half life, I throw in the white thing early and escape.  <br />
<br />
Mobs that I can't snare or root, normally don't get a look at long enough to see if they summon.<br />
<br />
If there is an opportunity to charm, I will use one almost everytime and hope it don't break.  When I play with charm to kill a summoner, I root my to-be pet first, charm him, then pull my target to my pet and root it on my pet.  If charm breaks and I get summoned.... at least both mobs are rooted with a chance for recovery.  I'll apply DS to my pet after engage.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

Backing into a corner used to work wonders to help you channel thru spells and heals but with the new auto rewind thing that's borked.. you'll just bounce off and have your spell interupted from the movement heh</div></div><hr />

It is VERY annoying, not just for casting, but for normal everyday things.  If you get to close to a counter or wall, you are thrown back.  Have I said, &quot;VERY annoying&quot; yet?  hehe</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to run up the wall to get an overhead view of the first cavern and I'm constantly booted back into the middle of the hall.  I was able to get it to work, but it usually took multiple tries to succeed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lylean Winterleaf</div><div class="date">04-14-2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It really depends on level and difficulty. Got to say, the only summoning mobs I'be soloed successfully at 62 were the corrupted brownie for the epic and the fabled chief goonda. With the brownie I just kept it rooted, threw dots on it and healed myself in between summons if I had to. You can get fast casting heals and dots / nukes off, casting time of the spell and good timing is essential there. Also, the corrupted brownie seemed to start summoning fairly late 8only at around 80% health or so), so it wasn't too bad. <br />
The fabled chief goonda was as all the other fabled mobs not rootable or snarable, so I just ran like hell, tried to get enough distance to him with SoE to be able to get a dot off before he came into melee range, then ran like hell again. Admittedly though goonda is one of the easiest fabled as he is a caster, so he stopped fairly often to cast, which made things a whole lot easier. <br />
Don't see me soloing any other summoning mobs any time soon. Died to the corrupted seafury cyclops once and to the fabled Proon, so hard hitting summoning stuff = bad!</div></div><hr />

Tried Bzzibuzzana and the Irritating Mushroom in PoM with charmed skunks.  Admittedly, I could have been better prepared, but the most frustrating part was the fact that I had the mushroom down to 1% (I wish I had DS on me), when charm broke, and the bixie down to 6% when charm broke.  <br />
<br />
Sigh.  Think there must be some sort of curse on my charm spells to make them crap out at exactly the wrong moment :(</div></div><hr />
