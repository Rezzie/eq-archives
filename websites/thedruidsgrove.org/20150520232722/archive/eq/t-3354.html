<br />
I've been looking for a list of items that grant either infravision or ultravision.  Can anyone rattle out a quick list?<br />
<br />
I know of a 'Glowing Stone Band' which I've seen in the Bazaar for 499pp, would that be one to go for, or are there cheaper/more useful items that grant infravision nowadays?<br />
<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />

Get a little grp together go down and grab one, it's a bit of fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, the stone band looks like the most likely option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There used to be a drop in the Grimling Forest called a Grimling Eyeball that had infra - it was range and face slot, I believe.  I don't know what dropped it though.<br />
<br />
You might also try a bazaar search for a Eyepatch of the Shadows, not sure what they run for.  It's a pretty high level Kael encounter, so it's probably worth a few plat.  Also, it's ultravision, not infravision - they usually go for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's actually for a level 17 alt of mine ;) <br />
<br />
I'm only 38 as a main, so most stuff is simply out of my price range.  Just saw the ring after raking in a couple of hundred plat in cougar earrings and thought &quot;should I get this, or is there something cheaper out there now that so much time has passed?&quot;<br />
<br />
May go the get-it-yourself option, but haven't been properly playing EQ for a while, need to make some friends again first :evil:</div></div><hr />

<br />
First cheapest option is adjusting the gamma setting in the new UI to around 50%.  &lt;img src=http://lag9.com/wink.gif&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wore a glowing stone band on my monk till I was 60 with a dozen aa or so.  It works.  Finally picked up a tranix crown from the bazaar when it opened.  Hunted fg's for a month and never got one 8(   Was fun tho, recommended for a small tough group :cool:   And please, remember to snare!  They run fast!<br />
<br />
Playing with the gamma never did a thing for me.  It annoys me to no end when people say &quot;oh just turn up the gamma!&quot;  It annoys me more that VI seemed to think that being able to SEE their game should require hours and hours of work for a race (well 2 races but eruds have other issues) with no discernable benefits, or fiddling with my own computers drivers!<br />

<br />
Seems to depend on your graphics card... mine's pretty dark even with it set at 100%... one option is to get Powerstrip and tweak it even further :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">09-08-2002, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gamma might not work too well if you have no night vision at all, since EQ will draw unlit areas as totally black.  A nice light source, such a froglok crown or greater light stone, might fix some of this.  But with infravision, you can give yourself the effective power of ultravision by bumping up the gamma.  And with ultravision and high gamma, it's almost blinding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">09-09-2002, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm that's a quite likely explanation.  /sigh.  Still annoys me.  I've long since made it a habit to sacrifice a main inv slot for a Greater Lightstone.  It hasnt been till recently that I've discovered the need for keeping one or two in the bank for CR / coffin time runs.<br />
<br />
Also a good use for that 10shot UV mask from chardok hehe (down to 7 shots!).<br />

<br />
Also, since it's for a monk, you might consider the Horned Beetle Mask from Hollowshade Moor.  Drops off Gorehorn, a level 35ish large beetle (who's pretty MR).  Mask stats:  +6 AC +4 Str +3 Sta +6 vsMg +6 vsPos  with 5 charges of UV.  weight 0.1  Also lore :( <br />
I keep one on both my Erudite Paladin and Cleric for CR ;) .  (Haven't bought any more SCM yet.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">09-11-2002, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, whilst those have charges of ultravision, they're only really useful for CR.  I'm looking for something more permanent :)   But thanks, each idea helps.<br />
<br />
Glowing stone band seems like the best solution all round - didn't buy it on sight though, which is a shame as I've heard it's uber-rare and doesn't usually sell as cheap as it was on the bazaar (500).  Oh well :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cloudien</div><div class="date">09-25-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sweet, grabbed a Glowing Stone Band for 250p :) <br />
<br />
Due to the Bazaar Effect: lots of stuff out of banks that nobody could be bothered to sell + sudden ability to sell it all = lots of supply.  Big supply with a lower demand = LOW prices.<br />
<br />
I think they put them a bit *too* low this time though - there were about 4 people selling them at this price, and within 10 minutes they'd gone.<br />
<br />
A good buy I think :)</div></div><hr />
