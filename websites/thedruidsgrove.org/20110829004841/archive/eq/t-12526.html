 <br />
my guild has just entered anguish, we've been in tacvi for about a month, and we've just started attempting yar'lir (3rd attempt and he's down to 30ish%).<br />
i'm really lacking in foci, so any suggestions on good items with foci on from anguish+tacvi+don dragons would be great.<br />
 <br />
thanks,<br />

I was wondering what you would suggest for the rings, face and earrings.<br />
<br />
For rings I have it narrowed down to Ring of Persecution, Ring of Deterrence,  Ring of Ire Intent and Ring of the Serpent.<br />
<br />
For face I have it narrowed down to Mask of the Ancients, Mask of Forbidden Rites and Xxeric's Matted-Fur Mask.<br />
<br />
Earring I have it down to Earring of Dragonkin, Accursed Earhoop of Pain, Stud of Chilling Precision, Clawed Earring of Determination and Loop of Entropic Hues.<br />
<br />
I was also wondering if you would consider doing one of the lesser items and replacing it with 1 of the higher items later on or if any of the above items are so rare I should be looking for an alternative instead.<br />
<br />
Here is my Magelo incase it helps.<br />

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />

If you're not near the top priority, best bet is to find the best upgrades you can in tacvi since tacvi gear will carry you a decent amount of time and generally isn't the most expensive stuff (assuming a dkp system) you can get.  If you are near the top of the loot list then I would say make an alternate magelo with the few really nice pieces of gear that you want (i.e. Mask of the Ancients, Accursed Earhoop of Pain, etc...). <br />
<br />
Clickies like Xxeric's Matted-Fur Mask and Earring of Pain Deliverance, are good ones to have.</div></div><hr />
