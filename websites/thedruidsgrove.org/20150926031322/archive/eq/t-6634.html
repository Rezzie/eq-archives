<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tudamorf</div><div class="date">02-10-2004, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The description of Spell Casting Subtlety reads:  &quot;After training this ability, NPCs will notice your magical activities 5, 10, and 20 percent less.&quot;  Arguably, this is one of the better GoD AAs so I went out and tested it to see if the description holds true.  (Note, this ability costs 3/6/9, as opposed to the caster version which costs 2/4/6.)<br />
<br />
The test was rather simple.  I generated a high degree of taunt with one character on the usual Guinea pig (mist panther) and then attempted to taunt off with snare, counting the number of casts it takes.  I used two different taunt values and repeated each test twice (it was the same in both instances, each time).  Positioning of the characters was about 75 paces and remained constant.  Memory blur reset the subject after each test until it retuned to indifferent.<br />
<br />
Premise:  if snare generates X taunt per cast, and if, per the description, SCS makes the target notice the snare 20% less, then we would expect post-SCS snare to generate .8X taunt per cast.  That would mean it would take &lt;b&gt;25% more&lt;/b&gt; hits of snare to generate the same taunt.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Test 1&lt;/b&gt;:  Taunt is Tashan + Slow + Tashan + Slow.  Without SCS, it took 5 casts of snare to taunt off.  With SCS3, it took the same 5 casts of snare to taunt off.  This test suggests that the actual effect is &gt;= 0% and &lt;= 17%.  This is inconsistent with the premise; if it took 5 casts before, and you now have to cast 25% more, you would expect it to take 6 or 7 casts, depending on how much you taunted past the break point the first time.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Test 2&lt;/b&gt;:  Taunt is Tashan + Slow + Cripple + Tashan + Slow + Cripple.  Without SCS, it took 6 casts of snare to taunt off.  With SCS3, it took &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; casts of snare to taunt off.  Clearly SCS3 is doing &lt;b&gt;something&lt;/b&gt; here.  This test suggests that the actual effect is &gt; 0% and &lt;= 25%.<br />
<br />
While my crude test doesn't answer the question definitely, it answered my two most pressing concerns:  (a) this ability does do &lt;b&gt;something&lt;/b&gt; to affect taunt and (b) that effect is to lessen the taunt (believe it or not, there was a time where this ability was rumored to work in reverse).  I hope someone else has the time to test this skill more thoroughly so that we can verify that the in-game description is correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can control my nukes and debuffs and usually not get agro.  But one small heal to a tank can get me summoned and beat down instantly though.<br />
<br />
I've read some posts of people in beta saying it didn't work on heal spells.  If it doesn't work on heals, it's pretty useless IMO, at least until I have points to spend I don't know what to do with anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now with spell casting subtelty 2(not yet 3) the first single snare, does not gain me aggro for a first summon when i put hasted frog on the giant.<br />
<br />
Definately noticed i could Hand of Ro, or Eci's Breath when the target was at 90-95% on ldon without getting aggro, as opposed to the 85-90% hp before.</div></div><hr />

Jolt would have been much better.  But we asked for SCS and they gave it to us.  It's too bad we didn't research true worth of the AA first.  Heh ... I keep hearing this quote in my head ... &quot;Be careful what you wish for...&quot;</div></div><hr />

The quote I hear is &quot;Don't make assumptions.&quot;<br />
<br />
You assume that druids didn't ask for Jolt, and were not aware of the differences between SCS and Jolt and the advantages and disadvantages of each.  Both of your assumptions are wrong.</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  Passive abilities are inherently more useful than activated ones or spells, even if the spells are more effective.  With a spell, I have to (a) waste a spell slot, (b) waste mana, (c) waste time target the offending NPC each time (not necessarily the thing I have targeted at the moment), and (d) waste time casting a spell and waiting for recast.  Spells can be resisted (e.g., enchanter's Boggle).  Spells also aren't helpful when there are multiple targets are aggro.  All of these hassles do not exist with a passive ability.<br />
<br />
Jolt may be nice for a ranger, who isn't tight on spell slot real estate and almost always wants to cast it on the current target in between swings, but it's too simplistic a spell for druids.</div></div><hr />

Looking at the crude test, SCS performs exactly as announced. I purchased all 3 levels and can see quite a difference : I nuke more I heal more, I get aggro less easily in general. <br />
<br />
One thing it wont do is eliminate aggro. But it does reduce it, and thus, it does help us, AND mages, perform better. A mage could sustain 20% more DPS without gaining aggro (Actually it would be 25%,  1/0.8).<br />
<br />
You dont want it, thats your prerogative. I like it just fine, I dont regret the purchase one bit.<br />

<br />
I was testing my limits on a ring event in POE, chain nuking with destroy summoned on summoned, using summers on others.  I think it was Peregrin Numbskull that I started casting destroy on at 90% and chained it till he was dead.  Hit 21 times.  I know DS has a lower agro than our other nukes, but I would think that would have gotten some attention.  Then during mud ring, I healed once and BAM, agro.<br />
<br />
In normal exp, I have a group of friends that do PoF tables often, kiting in circles.  We rotate, one druid kites while another meds, the rest of the group going nuts with DPS.  I normally pull with snare, hit with a Eci, then throw a couple nukes when I'm kiting and I kept agro just fine.  Well last night it was a PITA trying to keep agro, I was having to toss alot more nukes to keep him focused on me, even had the SK casting voice of thule to help me out.<br />
<br />
The effect SCS had on my hate kiting was unexpected, but I'll get lvl 3 soon as I can spare the AA for it.  I think it was worth it, although I was hoping for more effect in the healing area rather than the nuking.</div></div><hr />

Your agro issue is with your spell choices, not SCS.  A group of me with SCS3 and 5 Wizards I kept agro almost constantly under their nuking by casting snare a lot.  Pull with Snare (or E`ci when pulling outside the tables area), hit E`ci's then snare a ton.  I don't usually start nuking until about 50% (after a good 4-6 snares have hit) and even then a snare once for every nuke.  Do that and you'll have no trouble keeping agro in even the most damaging goups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was lobbying for Jolt actually back in the day actually.  So yeah, druids were asking for Jolt.  But most druids were asking for SCS thinking that it would solve our aggro problems.  Mages have done the same experiments and while SCS performs as advertised, the mages found that it only allowed them a single extra cast of Shock of Swords before getting summoned within the same time period.  For druids ... That would be an extra cast of chloroblast.<br />
<br />
While I won't turn away and extra chloroblast, it still isn't all that.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
Testing on Jolt shows that a resisted Jolt still reduces aggro.  I would point you over to the Ranger's Glade for proof, but they've got their panties in a bunch about another druid ability right now.  Druids comming to the Glade to ask for Jolt is going to make them go super-critical.</div></div><hr />

omg that would SUCK<br />
<br />
and yeah, I agree, keep aggro with ensnare...even just chaining...</div></div><hr />

It is not a miracle cure, but it helpson debuffs and unkes, alot. In God trials 5 and 6, where named mobs are hitting hard (1500+) and FAST, scs is a lifesaver. I can use hand of ro earlier, and nuke harder. One thing I have noticed though; where I woudl cast a sylvan infusion (love this spell btw) before the first cleric CH woudl land, (yes, an 11k tank can get taken down in less than 10 seconds here) I ran a substantial risk of almost instant death. Wheather Sylvan infusion is very high agro, or scs does not work on heals, I do not know, but be aware.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
While you may be able to get away with a bit more and not draw agro you still do need be mindful of the spells you're casting. <br />
 <br />
SCS isn't going to allow you to just empty your mana bar, you still need to actually think about the spells you are using and the timing of casting them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">beasthealer</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 05:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that part of the problem in getting heals agro is that it AE agro.<br />
Healing a tank affect all monster around you while Nuke only Agro the one mob.<br />
That effect how it seem to be working, also Since i heal for much more then i nuke (AHA3 + mar gift) give me about 20% more agro from heals compare to Nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiane</div><div class="date">05-03-2004, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a way though that makes SCS more effective for healers, which is why they've been reluctant to give it to us for so long.  Because it's a flat change on the cast which gets applied to anything that notices.  With nukes, that means only the target notices x% less, but for heals, it means everything in range notices it less, for a much greater net effect.<br />
<br />
I did finish up SCS3 finally.  Cant say I notice a *lot* of difference, but there is some.  I'm very used to riding the edge of aggro, and it allows me to push it a little more, which is nice because in xp groups at least I cant spend my mana fast enough by nuking without getting aggro...</div></div><hr />
