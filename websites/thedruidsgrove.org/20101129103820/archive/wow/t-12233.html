So I was wondering, where should I draw the line with wearing cloth? <br />
<br />
I assume it's pretty much okay in a raid situation because, although healers do take damage, the damage healers take is small in comparison to a pvp scenario.<br />
<br />
So, what I'm really asking is in an arena setting, preferably 2v2, should I being wearing full leather, or can I sub a few pieces of cloth in, or could I get by wearing all cloth? (Keep in mind in any situation I would never slack on Stamina)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance ;3</div></div><hr />

<br />
Armor which is often overlooked (even by me sometimes) is very helpful in arena settings, especially when your shift into Bear and it multiplys your armor value. Unless your cloth piece is FAR greater than your leather one, stick with leather at all costs (and Blizzard has fine tuned itemization so you won't have to choose between armor types most the time)</div></div><hr />

We get additional healing with +spirit and Tree of Life form. This is why you're seeing a lot of spirit on our armor.<br />
<br />
In arena situations; I would honestly avoid cloth. The armor decrease just isn't worth it when you're generally the first target sought after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
will you actually be in tree form? or caster?<br />
<br />
if tree then HELL YEAH pour on the spirit increases healing 25% of spirit. in caster form this bonus does not apply so yes in fact its useless <br />
<br />
cloth gear does have better stats than our leather in some cases.  in PVP/Arena it wont make a difference in caster form. what are you talking +100 armor from cloth to leather. if the cloth is better then go w/ it. <br />
<br />
w/ season 1 avail now it might be easier to replace the cloth w/ it and add + resilance gems to lessen damage and as far as the above poster also nice stam buff<br />

As long as there is no warlock, it basically plasters a HUGE &quot;Kick me!!&quot; sign on your druid and if you have the better resilience of the group (like i do), then this can cut down seriously on your healing burden. Stack up your three hots and shift to travel form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He started by putting all HoTs on himself.  Then he shifted catform and killed 1 horde.  Then he went tree again, put more hots up, then cat.. killed another.  It was pretty incredible to watch.<br />
<br />
This was pre-tbc though.<br />

In arena you'll want to stick to leather.</div></div><hr />

Have to earn it back with leet healing skills.</div></div><hr />

Like anyone even notices what type of gear you are wearing...<br />
<br />
I will say, that the new &quot;inspect&quot; feature that allows you to see other players talents has opened my eyes to just how bad some folks spec their characters.  I'm only familiar with Hunter and Druid specs, but just about every Druid and Hunter I have looked at  (maybe 2-3 of each type) has had a handful of really bogus talent points.  Maybe they just don't care?  Maybe I'm just too much of a min/max player to just go and place talent points willy-nilly based purely on the tooltip description?</div></div><hr />

Hum, Tree Form is a BC Talent. It's not possible that was pre-BC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abies</div><div class="date">12-09-2007, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it could have been with patch 2.0. That was before BC came out, but it had all the new talents in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">12-10-2007, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Tree Form came out with 2.0, 4-6 weeks before TBC. I was in Naxx as a tree. It was a trip.<br />
<br />
And, things were a lot different pre-tbc as opposed to now, especially in pvp. Think about it, after 2.0, everyone had high warlord weapons that put out an 'obscene' 80ish dps/2-hander and what, high 60ish dps/1hander? Also players had closer to 6000 health when well geared and today we're at what? 10k? I see a player who's arenaing with less than 10k health and ROFL.<br />
<br />
So I see it as entirely possible that the tree could have done that TBC.</div></div><hr />

One druid on my server, famed for having the highest +healing of _anyone_ on the server, did an experiment the day tree form came out.<br />
He went outside Ironforge and asked people to duel him.  The idea was that they had to kill him.  All he would do is stand there in tree form, and heal himself.  They could use stuns, silences, or whatever they liked against him.<br />
<br />
I sat and watched rogues backstab him continously for more than 15 minutes.  Mortal strike warriors bashed their heads against him, mages oom'd on him, everything.  Not once did he die, not once did he run out of mana, or fight back, or even move - not so much as turning on the spot.  He just sat there healing.  Nobody, but nobody, could kill him.<br />

Hmm a mana draining warlock with a dps pet out couldn't even do the trick?<br />
 Keep all dots stacked on him, keep the pet on him, then continuously drain mana, probably should have worked, eventually anyway.  Anyway theorycrafting that scenario is moot at this point.</div></div><hr />
