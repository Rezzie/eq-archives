<br />
i may finally start a DK - quick question<br />
<br />
Does it matter on the race ?<br />
<br />
Almost all the dk's i see and know are Blood Elves ?<br />
<br />
But i fancied sticking with a Tauren ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SmartBlond521</div><div class="date">07-24-2009, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that it depends more on your preferred play style.  I play Alliance, but I stuck with my NE because I enjoy having that racial ability (shadowmeld).  Since the DK will retain the racial ability of whatever you choose, that is one factor to consider.<br />
<br />
The starting stats of all of the DK races are posted on the community site at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/deathknight/</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-25-2009, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok past 58 now.<br />
<br />
been sent to thrall for a quest.<br />
<br />
a little stuck on talent points.<br />
<br />
anyone got a good levelling build for unholy - as the really good DK tank i talk about a lot recommends unholy to level for various reasons....aoe/self heal etc<br />
<br />
i've got 49 points to allocate ! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-27-2009, 03:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok got a bit of help from the excellent DK tank we often 5 man with.<br />
<br />
so spent all 49 in the Unholy tree.<br />
<br />
if anyone has a recommended levelling spec...unholy or otherwise please post it as i still need to look more into DK's.<br />
<br />
atm i'm just pushing buttons not really knowing what is doing what or when i should be using blood strike versus plague strike etc etc<br />
<br />
hmmm the grove has been very quiet over the weekend....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used one of the Unholy Builds there...but it really depends on play style.  For leveling, you might be interested in taking the talent called &quot;On A Pale Horse&quot; which increases your movement speed.  Other than that I really have no idea.  She's been sitting in an inn for about 2 months or more now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-28-2009, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks Des<br />
<br />
i'm unholy as that was recommended for levelling.  combination i was told of aoe plus some self healing.<br />
<br />
yes i think he mentioned pale horse cos it kept reminding me of the old westerns....high plains drifter and the slightly newer Pale Rider.<br />
<br />
as i briefly mentioned elsewhere i am finding it quite easier. 1 on 1 with a same level mob i probably lose 100 HP ! <br />
<br />
I am doing a bit of questing in EPL - bring back the memories....the guy with the 2 dogs at the Marris Stead, the Undercroft.....<br />
<br />
I thought i could ride through that Corrins place but got dismounted !  pulled 4 mobs and thought oh sh1t i'm dead. But nope.....put out some aeo stuff and pestilence.  used the self heal ability of some strike or other and a pot (although i think this was wasted) and still ended with just over 50% HP.<br />
<br />
Hoping to hit 60 in another day or 2 and move over to outlands.<br />
<br />
I need to get some professtions started to....thats my main reason for finally looking to level a DK - fed up of being the only person I know with a single high level and 2 professions !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-29-2009, 10:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, my DK still doesn't have any professions.  Just wasn't looking forward to going back to lowbie land to grind them out =( and she's level 68 right now.<br />
<br />
I just don't play the toon often enough.  I have my caster toons, that are fun for &quot;caster moods&quot; and my melee toons for when I feel like hand to hand combat...lately I've liked my casters more.<br />
<br />
Although, I don't quite understand my elemental shaman.  They're primarily casters, as I understand it.  But the whole...totem thing...too much to remember...that, and if I drop them before a fight, the first thing a mob does is come tear them down...then try to beat me up.  =(  /cry I don't understand the classsss....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-30-2009, 02:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i dont mind going back to lowbie areas for professions - i've done that before when i took up herbing on my then level 60 and happily trundled around Azeroth for a while getting lowbie herbs and helping out the occasional levelling person with something when they saw a maxed out lvl 60 go past them ! :p<br />
<br />
shammies are really useful in some of the 5 mans with that fear totem. and they can do very good dps.  a couple we do stuff with who are nicely geared...mainly epics around ilvl 200-213 put out 2.6k or a bit more.<br />
<br />
i do love having one for the extra crit/spellpower totem and the one that adds to spell haste.<br />
<br />
They appear to be fine at healing to, although i have no idea what they have as healing abilities apart from that chain heal....no idea if they are HOT healers like druids or not.<br />
<br />
At least if a mob is tearing down your totem its not beating on you giving you time to take it down....totems as alternative target ftw ! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">07-30-2009, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My impression of Shaman healing is a mix: strong AoE with Chain Heals, moderate single target heals with Healing Wave, and moderate HoT with Riptide.<br />
<br />
We have a couple of Resto Shammies that I raid with from time to time, but my Shammy is only in her late 20s, so can't speak much from direct experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">07-30-2009, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure I fail at Shamaning.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand the class.  I forget to drop totems...and sometimes just don't want to waste the mana on dropping a totem or struggling to pull mobs back to them....I'm a bad bad shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-03-2009, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hehe Des, i'm doing ok atm solo questing with the DK.<br />
<br />
what's bugging me atm is DK professions.<br />
<br />
instead of levelling i've spent the weekend back in The Barrens picking n00by herbs / sigh to level herby.<br />
<br />
they give you a DK at 55, who by the time you finish the new DK area is 58 and ready to go through the Portal (which by the way i could not remember its location!). You get some pretty nice looking blue gear through the opening quests for every slot....<br />
<br />
yet you have to level from 1 a profession meaning you have to go back and waste time in Azeroth when all you want to do is level !<br />
<br />
surely they cuold have done this differently......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinae</div><div class="date">08-04-2009, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed.  I am DREADING that epic grind for lowbie mats. <br />
<br />
I was thinking of making the old DK into a Blacksmith, since I'm hoping to make her into a tank eventually (our guild is HURTING for tanks), but man, the prospect of A) spending insane amounts of gold to level the profession or B) Spending insane amounts of time leveling mining with BS and probably also sick amounts of gold...it just makes me cringe.  But, it'll be worth it to level them w/o cheating (as in buying all the mats instead of farming them) because there's at least the chance of getting some return $ on it.<br />
<br />
And making gear for other guildies and my alts...hmm...we shall see...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">08-05-2009, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well as i level her herby i am notciing a change whereby i am still getting level ups on herbs in The Barrens at past 150 herby skill ?<br />
<br />
Just need to decide where to go next to take me past 200.  Then work out how quickly i can be at the level that will allow me to pick HFP herbs so i can recommence levelling.<br />
<br />
still sitting at 20k from lvl 60 as i was about 5 days ago!</div></div><hr />
