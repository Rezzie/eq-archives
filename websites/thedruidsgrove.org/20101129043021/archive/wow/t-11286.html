It is so nice to be able to play and just dominate everyone. Granted I only got my guy up to 31 whenever I get near the x9 mark I'm always toping the list in kills. When I grind I can take on 2-3 guys without really ever having to stop to take a break.<br />
As I'm typing this I'm not sure why.. I just got sick of trying to hard to get my guy geared well but seeing small differences(unless I'm trying to get lots of sta/ac). I must say it was really wierd not being able to heal my fellow players, however it is nice not to have someone yell at me because I didn't heal them when 5 alliance were on them :p.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-21-2006, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I really like my warlock too.  Though I've been stuck in my mid 40's now for a while, and as I'm on a different server than my raiding druid, have very little time / patience to find PuG's for Ulda / Mara, which I really need to do to get through this lv 40 slump.  <br />
<br />
I'm currently Affl speccd, probably going to spec into Demonologist at 45 (so I can still have insta corr), but I think I'd miss Imp Life Tap, Imp Life Drain and Fel Concentration.  Though a heavy destruction build seems insane, with the front loaded Conflag / fire damage.<br />
<br />
Hard sometimes for me to decide who to play - my druid (still favorite), 60 shadow priest, 44 warlock, 33 fury warrior, or this new lv 28 rogue that I just started.  Too many alts &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

Although honestly I think I'm gonna have the same problem with her that i had with my hunter, leveling's fun as heck, 5 mans are fun as heck, but raiding might be a bit boring.  I really enjoy the druid versatility in raids, I guess just range DPSing bores me a bit. :(  But we'll see.. I figure it'll be nice having a 60 lock to bring on raids where we need casters badly (some reason we have a lack of dependable casters for raids).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Practice</div><div class="date">11-22-2006, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried most of the other classes, and although I'm spending a lot of time with my warrior alt at the moment, I really like my warlock.  I wish I'd left him at level 19 for a while though, 'cos he kicked a** in the BGs. :)<br />
<br />
The two classes that I don't enjoy playing so far are paladins and rogues.  Paladins seem confusing and complicated, and rogues are just simply boring.  It's strange because I really love cat form.  Go figure. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">11-22-2006, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I couldn't get into rogue either, although I tried twice... just got kinda bored after level 18 or so.  I found priest to just be annoying to level 1-10, so uh, never got far there, although shadow priests sound quite fun, and I died 29372923 times playing a mage in westfall so never got far there either &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
I have a level 60 druid, 60 hunter, 40 lock, 30 warrior, and a 16 pally right now... plan on remaking the pally once BC comes out, cause I want a sexy blue chick xD  I really enjoy the pally so far, seems a lot like druid, but since I'm remaking her, I'm not leveling her atm.<br />
<br />
Oh I tried a shammy too on another server, that was fun.  Might start one of those come BC too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">11-22-2006, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually kinda hated my rogue that I started until about lv 20 when I got vanish and poisons.  My damage dealt went up quite a bit, and I never die anymore with vanish.  Rogue starts getting pretty fun at 26 or 28 when you get Cheap Shot.  And to me rogue is pretty much only fun if you are a sword rogue (I've been both sword and dagger so far).  There is something kinda lame to me about stabbing someone in the back when you can be slicing their face with two (good) swords.  <br />
<br />
Dual wielding Fury Warrior is SUPER fun too.  So much damage and rage generation.  <br />
<br />
I have a 16 palladin with some good gear (that I got as drops while leveling my rogue), but I'm having a hard time getting into it.  I heard that it gets a lot more fun at lv 20 when you can spec into Seal of Command in the Ret tree.  Not sure if I'm gonna keep leveling this one.<br />
<br />
Shadow priest was SUPER fun to level, as they are really really strong.  Getting past the first 19 or so levels was kind of a pain (smiting ftl) but once you get Mind Flay it starts to get fun, then once you get Shadow form, forget about it.<br />
<br />
Warlock is probably the easiest class to level (since my shadow priest), and most fun I've had.  Which is cause they are just so strong.  And I'll get jumped by rogues 4 lvls higher than me and I can death coil, fear wtfpwn.  Warlocks are basically godly.  But yeah Khar, I can see just spamming ShadowBolt in raids getting a little boring.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if I'll get her to 60 ever or not, but 70 with crusader strike does look pretty tempting.<br />
<br />
23 Priest ( shadow ) - Fun as hell. Leveling with my friend who rolled a lock.  We kill things, lots of things, quickly.<br />
<br />
18 Warlock - never got into him that much.  Just couldn't get the feel for it, I might reroll a human ( rolled a gnome named &quot;Ibiteknees&quot; - maybe that's the problem )<br />
<br />
35 Mage - he's fun.  Fire spec and things just drop to the floor.<br />
<br />
I rolled a rogue, but only got her to 11 - just didn't really feel it.<br />
<br />
I have a UD priest on a pvp server =D .  Ezmode, I know but what the heck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, a few of the pallies in my guild have transfered to the PTR, and have said that Crusader Strike is insane.  Apparently DPSadin is viable now.<br />

Gnomes eww.  My favorite part by far about my horde characters are killing gnomes.<br />
<br />
Warlock + Shadow priest = scary damage.  I wish my Shadow Priest was UD.  Devouring Plague and WoTF is imba vs Starshards and Shadowmeld.</div></div><hr />

I, too, tried a warlock alt when my server went down. Gnome, of course. I was still a beginner, granted, but I just didn't like it... I think it was being a gnome. I'll probably reroll one in the future.<br />
<br />
I'll have to say though, druid has to be my favorite class. And yeah, I also made a rogue alt (catform addict I am), but I've died so many freaking times in Westfall... I just can't get used to the lack of heals and lack of bear form... I never noticed how reckless I am until I rolled that rogue. I hope it gets better, and I never thought I'd say that.</div></div><hr />

Really like levelling my druid too (35 now); it's so versatile. But I only just manage to use my cat-form since I mostly miss all those things my rogue can do. Some real burst damage, anyone?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Im only lv 30 with my rogue right now, so i just barely got kidney shot.  I'm a LONG way off from raiding with my rogue, as all my raiding time is devoted to my druid.  I kinda just started a rogue to learn how they work, and am starting to have a lot of fun with it.  <br />
<br />
I'm thinking of a Prep / Hemo build, but i'm not sure.  Hows hemo pre lv 60? I heard its great for combo point generation... Im a human rogue, so I have the +sword racial, and combined with Precision in combat I rarely miss things.  Which is nice.  I played with daggers and got frustrated at missing stuff all the time.  I've been maxing out both skills, and carry a good dagger with me... so many different ways to spec and play a rogue its crazy.  <br />
<br />
Then again, I started playing my warlock again this weekend, and got a few lvls and some gear (woot bad mojo mask) on it in ZF, and am jazzed on my warlock again.  Argh too many alts, not enough time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uvgrin</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I kind of got one rule about playing mmorpg, and that's no raiding. I know I miss out on lots of good gear. That's my imaginary line I don't step over. <br />
That's sort of why I started my lock, my druid sort of hit the glass ceiling. It would of taken lots of time for smaller improvements. My druid is just my equipment farmer now :p<br />
<br />
I've got alot of +shadow gear, I've almost got 130 or so shadow spell power. The only problem is I'm like a glass cannon, I own most classes though within 3-4 of my lvl. except hunters I'll get them down though I hope. Well and rogues that 1 shot me those are problematic too :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atrus</div><div class="date">11-27-2006, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too have alot of alts.<br />
<br />
Warlock is my favorite by far.<br />
<br />
From now on if I want to do damage in pvp I'm just going to go in with my lock.  It's alot of fun.  Fear/Deathcoil/Howl/Curse of Ex make it so I can &quot;protect&quot; the flag carrier or even catch the other team's flag carrier so I still feel useful in doing something besides damage.<br />
<br />
I'm going to take my druid (or maybe even a paladin) into pvp when I want to support/heal.</div></div><hr />

I find it hard to live without the versitility and things like stealth! I played a rogue for a while and quickly learnt to gouge and then bandage before the stun wore off. Saved me heaps of times. Still they are very squishy.</div></div><hr />

I really don't think hemo's worth it till you get to 60 - or close to anyway; mainly because you need really heavy weapons, but also because the last skill upgrade is at lvl 54(?). I suppose it could go with something like Thrash Blade, but I haven't tried it.<br />
<br />
And maybe I should rephrase myself about raiding: because of the lesser DPS, hemo isn't a really good raiding build; a raid can make use of one hemo rogue, but not more. But it's sick CP generation, which makes it really fun to play :)<br />
<br />
