Is it in game, is the quest broken?  I've heard atm its broken, but can't really confirm.  I haven't heard of anyone finding a new arc / mission for a new spell/disc, so kinda believing it atm.<br />
 <br />
At the same time, that arc/mission is for the better of the 2 spell/trap/skill that players get, so possibly people are being secretive?  Figured i would see if anyone has any leads on where / what's goin on?<br />
 <br />
:physics: <br />
 <br />
So, I'm thinking that the mission/arc is in Elddar Forest.  I haven't seen many people messing around there because of getting ToB flagged.  There are a few group/solo missions you can get there, that i haven't had a chance to complete to check out yet.</div></div><hr />

It's not there. Unless it has something to do with the &quot;Chalice of Life&quot; that drops from the raid boss (Sony stated that this item currently has no use, but will next patch).<br />
<br />
After the next patch I'll see if I can do anything with the Chalice. The Eldarr missions are fun, and there's some decent loot for non-raid oriented people from the solo tasks there, but no spell.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Aye, I knew i saw someone post that it might be broken.  Only question i have is to the reliability of the information?  Did she get her info about the quest from a GM/Dev or some super secret inside info?  (Just to make 100% certain its currently broken and not just being called broken because ppl havent found it yet.)</div></div><hr />

I would say he's very reliable. <br />
<br />
In any case there's no telling when they might push it live (if done server-side) so keep your eyes open at least :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fenier, the Access for Razorthorn quest requires collecting 10 &quot;vials of corupted blood&quot;  in the box you are given by the NPC before entring Sverag, Stronghold of Rage.  Once all 10 are collected, you hand the box to the NPC and you get the flag.  Nothing else is required for this flag.  However, the Level 70 Aura Arc and the Skylance Arc, combined with the Razorthorn access, results in Theater of Blood Access.<br />

<br />
The secondary quest, after completing the Skin quest for your Barkspur spell is called Becoming The Vessel.  However, it is currently broken, since Grand Librarian Maelin does NOT return the books to you after you receive your new spell.  Those books are required for Becoming the Vessel.  The 03-14 patch is set to fix this.<br />

Yea I get that, but the Skins quest assigns you the Vessal quest which is required to Unlock the instance which gains you the flag for Razorthorn.<br />
<br />
Now I suppose you could just get invited into a group for the Corruption Task which means you can skil the Skins and the Vessal Quests, however, that requires you know someone who has done the first two tasks, and I didn't want my answer to be misleading in that sense.<br />
<br />
I suppose I could have been clearer, but for most people they will have to do the Vessal Quest to access Corruption, or at least this should be the case for most people for the next several weeks as I would think the number of people who have done Vassel is fairly small as we're less then 2 weeks into the expansion, and the fix for the quest isn't till mid March.<br />

Considering just to heal 2 ppl yo'd spend almost 1600 mana. It des have short range which is the sux whem u cast and everyone is OOR but otherwise it's a nice spell to have. WTB better nukes now so we stop getting pushed into the healer role.</div></div><hr />
