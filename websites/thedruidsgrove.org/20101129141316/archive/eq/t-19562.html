The Jaina voice from The Warcraft series of real time strategy had a warmer voice to her.  But, she whimpered alot as well in that series what with Arthas about to mow down a bunch a civilians infected by Mal'Ganis at Stratholme. Thrall, well Rexxar, The Shadow Hunter guy, Chen the panda, if you got him, killing her dad.  The burning legion thing in Kalimdor although it was funny when she defied Archimonde. The Sylvanas voiceover didn't care much for.  But, then again, I am probably more attached to those voices through that series.  Alot of people don't care much for the ending storyline, thinking it is a bit anti climatic with the their must be a lich king or the scourge will slaughter everyone mindlessly.  It was the same way with Pirates of the Caribean 2 and 3.</div></div><hr />
