<br />
So here is the scoop, I am going on a business trip, which gave me an excuse to get a laptop so I can play wow in my offtime. Does anyone have any ideas for good accessories to go with a difficult to use laptop? I have a mouse at the moment which should help significantly but there is no num keypad, and the insert,home,delete,page up/down are all in wierd spots. I've seen those gamers controllers, but I don't know if those work with how. Thanks for any advice! :D</div></div><hr />

So if it worked with eq, it's gotta work with wow. I've got about 20-30 hotkey's I use fairly regurarly. Thanks alot, I think I'll pick one up on my way home. Has anyone else used that piece? I'm curious if the controller part works to move around.</div></div><hr />
