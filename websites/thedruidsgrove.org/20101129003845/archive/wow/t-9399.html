<br />
What sort of playability can I expect from a Gigabyte 6800 PCI-E??<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a 400$ VC and I just wanted to know how to could handle in oh say... come pvp action or something. L8r!!!:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

What card do you currently have, or is this a totally new machine?</div></div><hr />

Buy the model that was cutting edge 3 months ago for half the price instead (spending $200 instead of $400).</div></div><hr />

I built my first computer from scratch instead of upgrading an old one and went for the top of the line. Of course after 2 months it wasn't top of the line anymore so I felt bad about that $500 card I splurged on. It is capable of resolutions twice of what my monitor is capable so most of it is useless for me. In all honesty, unless you play a FPS and reaction time is the key to victory you won't even use the top of the line capabilities. In MMORPGs, even with an excellent connection, lag will reduce the gameplay edge you would get no matter what you do; so it just comes down to getting a card that will allow you to play in any area with any number of people without dragging your performance down to unplayable levels. I would say just about anything with 256MB will do it until the next wave of games come out that requires the next generation cards. I know its hard to resist, but keep that extra money, spend it on a better keyboard/mouse etc. Something that will reduce the carpal tunnel from constantly playing and you will thank yourself for it.<br />

Eather way that will be a really nice card to play WOW<br />

*edit<br />
Also make sure you have plenty of ram atleast 1gig no less....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I currently have an Asus FX5700 256MB video card, and at that level the 256MB of RAM makes a HUGE difference in framerate and the quality I can set WoW to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mojo</div><div class="date">10-14-2005, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at a bunch of benchmark sites, and I only noticed like a 3-5 FPS difference between 128MB and 256MB VC. The thing to upgrade to get very noticeable results is RAM fo sho. something like a 25% increase in smoothness in-game. Oh well, im sure this computer will do just fine. Just gotta wait for 8 more hours......... heheh(then a little longer to get WoW cause now im completely cleaned out xD)</div></div><hr />
