<br />
What i'm trying to do though is to add my clickies (epic/arms) to a text hotkey and I've run out of ideas on how to do it.<br />
<br />
I know /doability is not the command as I thought it was, is there any text prompt to activate it either from it's slot, or from the hotkey bank?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eqduffer</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 09:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No way to do that, to my knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TryonB</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't hotkey it via text, but you can click-hold then drag an inventory slot to your hotkey bank.  Pressing an hotkey linked to an item in your inventory (either equiped or general) is like right-clicking it from your inventory window.<br />
<br />
But if your looking to do something like...<br />
/stand<br />
/(cast clickie item)<br />
/pause xx<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
...then no, I don't think there is a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ausversucht</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that you can hotkey the clickies by themselves, and yes I'm looking for a way to do something like this:<br />
<br />
/pause xx, /cast DOT1<br />
/pause xx, /cast DOT2<br />
/pause xx, /cast DOT3<br />
/(castclicky)<br />
/(castclicky)<br />
<br />
I would of course rearrange for best effiency/quickest overally damage, but roughly this is what I'm looking at doing.<br />
<br />
edit: clickies wouldn't need pauses</div></div><hr />

The clickies you mentioned would, they still have a cast time :) <br />
<br />
Hehe, When I'm doting up a mob, I like to alternate between spells and clickies to reduse cast time.  (Epic, Swarming Death, DoD bracer, IoR) that was there is no delay to start casting the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ausversucht</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, I was only thinking of the pause for spell gem refresh, but I would've figured it out the first time I tried (assuming I could ever figure out how to get em to cast in the first place). ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palarran</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 12:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really wanted to, you could start assigning a single keystroke to two different hotkeys.  This would activate two hotkeys at once with a single keystroke, letting you put a clicky item in one hotkey slot and a message in the other.  It's a very common thing for monks to do, to tie their epic clicky to flying kick.  Keep in mind it's a global change (applies to all characters played on that computer)...<br />
<br />
Edit: Err...forgot that you wanted to activate more than one clicky with a single keystroke.  Don't think that can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">L1ndara</div><div class="date">08-11-2003, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can get MacroQuest.  Of course, if you're caught using it, SOE could technically ban you although I don't know of anyone that has been.  As long as you don't set up obvious long abusive macros I doubt they'd care.  Aside from letting you do simple things like what you want which the game should allow, it also lets you have exact mana amounts instead of just a %, when you /tar it will always work, not like without it where even someone standing right beside you often can't be targetted, it will show you the class/level of anon people in the same zone, it can give you the direction and distance to people and tradeskill items including groundspawn.  You can also set up macros to do even the most insanely complex things like running around buying/foraging/picking up items, tradeskilling, selling etc.<br />
 <br />
  Anyway, worth it just for the accurate mana numbers and proper targetting that won't give &quot;out of range&quot; or whatever on the tank right beside you you're trying to target for a heal.  The exact direction and distance to players is pretty nice too, better than tracking and for classes without tracking it's really handy.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  I did for months, it was great.  Now I don't use EQ, so using MacroQuest is somewhat... pointless.</div></div><hr />
