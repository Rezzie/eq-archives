<br />
For all those out there with Primal Tenacity...is it worth it?  Does it work?  It it worth it even though I can only put 2 point in?<br />
<br />
Nature's Grasp is an old fav of mine - saved my kitty/bear arse plenty of times and I miss it, but Primal Tenacity does have it's appeal...especially after umpteen million times being HoJ'ed, stun locked, feared or death coiled...<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

I'm a big fan of any kind of stun / fear resist talents for PvP.  Though NG is huge for PvP too.  I actually ran into the same exact thing as you, and decided to put my last 2 points into PT.  <br />
<br />
I took unbreakable will with my priest for her pvp build, and now that I respecc'd out of it (back to wand spec), I notice getting stunned.  <br />
<br />
Heres another question:  Does PT give a chance to resist Dazed effects?  i.e. concussive shot, or when riding and getting hit by a mob and knocked off a mount?  Or are dazes not considered stuns?</div></div><hr />

I've got 3 points in primal tenacity right now, decided to give it a try and dumped nature's grasp and brutal impact to get it (I've got Intensity right now, and honestly I love it, for the rage and for the casting mana-regen for when I have to heal).  I was getting really annoyed with all the fears in dungeons and well, since I'm not pvping much at the moment (I use nature's grasp far more often in pvp), decided to give it a whirl and see how I liked it.<br />
<br />
And I'm still trying to figure out if I like it, lol.  To me it works... but not when I'd like it to work of course. It's very nice having a chance to resist fear when tanking, though, helps the group out quite a bit when you do resist.  When I'm DPSing I also get the joy of resisting the fears, then getting the boss beating my kitty butt, which is easily countered with a switch to bear, lol, which helps the group as well, so the boss doesn't go off to a squishy.  <br />
<br />
If I pvped, I'd probably be unsure as well, both seem pretty handy, but honestly I'd probably still keep nature's grasp, that's just very awesome for pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Primal Tenacity is good but you should try to get at least a point in NG and either put another one in there or maybe just opt for a 5%...up to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 1 point you can't go wrong.<br />
<br />
But I tend to pvp alot.  If indoors all the time where roots don't work, go with any other option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chloee</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it to be more of a PvE skill.  In PvP, I want things that will always work as you're always having to plan moves ahead as a Druid.  If it only worked sometimes, I'd lose my train of thought.  Instead I just use my PvP trinket. My guild doesn't really have fear ward outside of a twink Dorf, so its been valuable to me in heroics and on Nightbane tanking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anubrim</div><div class="date">03-09-2007, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back before the expansion came out and all i did was pvp I had 3 points in primal tenacity for about a month. After that month I personally decided it was not worth it. It does work from time to time but it seemed like I was getting feared and stunned just as much as I did without it. <br />
<br />
 My opinion is that 1 point in NG is worth alot more than 3 in PT. If I was balance or resto. spec. I would keep 5 points in NG but as feral i keep just 1 and it works great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
15% is really quite much in the WoW-universe, and resisting that crucial stun or fear can be what won you the battle.<br />
<br />
Oh.. and no, it doesnt work on daze. 110% sure.</div></div><hr />

Have a good weekend!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I consider it to be valuable. I also run 1pt in NG, love it more as a pre cat form rather than a &quot;oh shiat&quot; ability. So funny watch a warrior take a couple of combo points then get trapped by NG then I lat a rip and run off with a decent amount of DoT going on!</div></div><hr />
