Until i hit 70 i am not sure what better option i have as if i get cloth items i get the +spell dmg i need etc cant seem to get that with leather at the moment, i am going to repecc to leatherworker and get that up so i can make the epic set at 70 but all advice is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I've seen enchant/tailor boomkins. There's just more available for casters in cloth than leather. You'll find them wearing the occassional leather piece, usually set pieces, but there's no need to bias yourself toward leather if you're a caster.<br />
<br />
This isn't as true for holy paladins. To solo, they need plate. They might find some cloth that offers an upgrade to their healing, but can be forgiven to bank it in favor of plate for levelling.<br />
<br />
Whereas boomkins don't need high damage mitigation to solo. A holy paladin solos in melee range. A boomkin shouldn't find herself in melee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Snufflekins !  What a nice name for a druid ^_^<br />
<br />
Cloth/Leather is a secondary consideration for most boomkins.  Spell damage and other boomkin stats are more important than the armor value, although obviously if you had 2 items that are equal in every way except that one is cloth and the other is leather, go for the leather :&gt;<br />

This obviously is more important after you hit 70.<br />
<br />
This will change as you aquire your T5 boss-killer suit.</div></div><hr />
