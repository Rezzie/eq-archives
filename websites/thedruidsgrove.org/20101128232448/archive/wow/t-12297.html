<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ravnia</div><div class="date">01-04-2008, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently acquired Footwraps of Wild Encroachment (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=33582) to replace Zierhut's Lost Treads  (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=30674) but undecided what gems to socket them.  Do I ignore the socket bonus and lose +5 str from the Zierhut's Lost Treads and socket them with 2 +12 stamina gems?  Or get Shifting Nightseye (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24055) and Enduring Talasite (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24062) to receive the socket bonus and gain +1 str? Will the stamina be better than the str?  <br />
<br />
I am over the 415 defense cap.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 3 str do not make that much difference IMO.<br />
You could also go for +4 agi +6 sta if you need more dodge/crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dilalamer</div><div class="date">01-04-2008, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they are for tanking, the choice is obvious that you should go with AGI/Stam or pure Stam gems. Which one should be obvious based upon your role in raids: If you MT, get the pure Stam. If you offtank, the AGI/Stam will probably give you more bang for your buck.<br />
<br />
If you are using them for DPS, I'd say throw in one agi and one agi/hit gem. <br />
<br />
If you're going to use it for both, *always* socket for tanking. If you fail as a tank, everyone notices. If you fail at DPS, you have several other people to make up the shortfall.</div></div><hr />

Personally I find those boots not much better for tanking than the heavy clefthoof boots.  Defense skill gives you dodge chance as well, remember :&gt;  The difference in armor isn't huge either.<br />
Buuutt..  if you really want to use them for tanking... here's what I'd suggest.<br />
Red and yellow sockets.  Set bonus: +3 str<br />
So get:<br />
[Shifting Nightseye] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24055) +4 Agility, +6 Stamina (counts as red and blue)<br />
[Jagged Talasite] (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24067) +4 Critical Strike Rating, +6 stamina (counts as yellow and blue)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This gives you:<br />
<br />
12 Stamina<br />
4 Critical Strike Rating<br />
4 Agility<br />
3 Strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of:<br />
<br />
24 stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what I'd do, anyway...<br />

Why did you get the footwraps of wild encroachment for kitty DPS as opposed to the Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots? 29 str/29 agi &lt; 60 AP/29 AGI/22hit, IMO. I have mine slotted with 4agi/6 stam and an 8 agi gem and a 12 AGI enchantment, giving me:<br />
<br />
54 AGI,<br />
60 AP (plus the 54, yeilding 114 total AP or 125 with HotW),<br />
25 to-hit.<br />
<br />
Your's is giving:<br />
37 str (74 base AP)<br />
29 AGI (yeilding 29 AP, 103 total AP or 113 with HotW).<br />
18 to-hit<br />
+8% run speed<br />
<br />
I'd consider using the wild encroachment for tanking and get the Tabi boots for DPS. You're giving up 1% crit, 7 to-hit and 12 AP. Even if you switch out the +12 AGI enchant for a swiftcat's, your're still gaining 1/2% of crit, 17 to-hit and break even AP. I'd say that 1/2% of crit makes the boots worth while all by itself.</div></div><hr />

Much to my chagrin an hour's theorycrafting showed the two boots to be basically the same, with only extremely minor variances.<br />
<br />
<br />
The differences:<br />
<br />
Yours gives more crit chance, dodge chance, and hit rating.<br />
Mine give more armor, stamina, +healing, spell crit, intellect, and movement speed.<br />
<br />
The AP difference between the two in a raidbuffed situation is less than 1AP.<br />
