 <br />
So I was raiding last night with the guild I am apped to. And we were backflagging for Demiplane. Starting with the Bloodeye event.<br />
 <br />
So we clear the zone as normal and engaged Bloodeye. Due to a limited amount of curer's in the raid we had some deaths before Bloodeye himself was killed. So those of us that were dead and hovering at the time Bloodeye died and the task updated did not get the &quot;Task completed&quot; green text and we did not get the Blood Curse AA update. Petitions and bug reports were submitted and as far as I know only one was answered at the time of me logging out last night.<br />
 <br />
The answer was - if you are &quot;hovering&quot; in a mission or task at the completion, you will not get credit for the task completion.<br />
 <br />
This is a feature I, and others I am sure, would have liked to have known upon the implementation of this new &quot;feature&quot;.<br />
 <br />
Good luck all.<br />

While this may be intended it doesn't make sense to me. If it's to prevent some sort of 'cheating', then you shouldn't be able to use /rs or /gu or /g (didn't try /say). <br />
<br />
I thought it would be nice to tell everyone in all my chat channels that I was dead and to skip me in the druid epic rotation. But I couldn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good to know. I don't use the semicolon but I'll have to start. Seems odd it would make a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
does anyone else have CoTW regularly fail when people are dead with the new hovering system?  <br />
<br />
I've had it fail a lot, and not because people are zoning when I click it.  To make it work properly, I ask people to respawn at their bind location before I click... this seems to work.<br />
<br />
Hardly makes sense though, so must be a bug, right?</div></div><hr />
