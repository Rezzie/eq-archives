I am thinking from a pvp standpoint, because in pvp it seems that burst is king. Outlasting is great 1v1 but that never happens.<br />
With all that being said, I was curious what everyone thinks. I'm not thinking of anything crazy, but I am sacrificing small amounts of ap for higher crit. So far I'm liking it I seem to be a bit higher on the list.</div></div><hr />

Before that adding more attack power actually helps your DPS more.  It really depends on how much crit you are adding and how much AP you are sacrificing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sond</div><div class="date">11-28-2006, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The OP was asking about PvP, not raiding. In PvP against most classes, agi/crit is king because you only get a couple hits before you are dead. <br />
<br />
You aren't going to outlast a warlock, shaman, shadow priest, stun lock rogue, or fire mage. If you can't kill them in the first few seconds, you are a dead druid.<br />
<br />
You probably aren't going to outlast an arms/fury warrior or a PvP hunter.<br />
<br />
You can't outlast a Paladin, but he can't kill you either.</div></div><hr />

Some people like to crit more and hope for crit strings to win battles for them.  Some like more AP so they crit harder and do more reliable damage.  Neither answer is 'correct'.</div></div><hr />

IMO i think that once you reach a certain amount of crit chance, your not helping yourself much by building on that over and over again.  for instance, 28% crit isn't much better than say 23-24% crit, whereas with 24% your critting almost as often but with much higher crits resulting in more burst dps (not to mention higher regular hits as well).  especially with the new LotP adding 5% crit instead of 3%, AP/STR is gonna be the way to go.  especially with 20% str being added thanks to heart of the wild.  Well, thats my opinion, sry for the long post, im just super bored.  Let me know any other opinions, this is the third or fourth belief ive had on ap v crit and i dont doutb it will change again :)</div></div><hr />
