 <br />
hopefully they could fix both and change the icon =p</div></div><hr />

The no wore off message tho, ticks me off a bit.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I am a bit worried about this spell, as the dot effect will keep breaking mezzes, so it's going only to be useful when encs are not in group .. or mybe not<br />
umm RSS ... puller trains 2-3 .. druid cast spore spiral .. 15 seconds pass .. mobs play flipper taking turns summoning the druid .. is this scenario correct?</div></div><hr />

It is simply a root version of our 69 Snare with a knockback effect.</div></div><hr />

Will this work to interrupt gates?</div></div><hr />

Have not tested it much on casters, tho I would assume the knockback is powerful enough to interupt a cast.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winenose</div><div class="date">10-06-2005, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried this in The Narglior Pits or whatever the zone is with Boss of the Pit. It was part of DS access. Something started to cast gate, Spore Spiral hit it, I didn't see it bounce  back / up as I usually, but got no resist message either.. and the mob DID gate away. <br />
 <br />
So I still have no clue if it interrupts casting. There's some casters with long cast times.. like cleric golems in Thundercrest.. can probably do some controlled-environment testing there while they CH.</div></div><hr />

Appears to be fixed with today's patch.<br />
<br />
At least the one time I casted it today, I got a wear-off message and I have never gotten one before the patch.</div></div><hr />

Me and another druid buddy got the spell at the same time and we pretty much just spent the next mission only rooting the mob and having fun with the tank.  Good times.<br />
 <br />
The jump effect is only be a gimmick though.  It doesn't interupt spells.  I tried it on all three types of casters in PoF, including cleric CH.  It didn't affect them at all.</div></div><hr />

Well the thing is, you're rooting, then knocking back... so they just &quot;jump&quot; and stay in the same place. If the root was AFTER the knockback, they would effectively knock back and then root. I don't know if this is intended however...</div></div><hr />

very short range, long cast time, long reload time make this spell a sucker. <br />
range and cast and recast times were justified when this spell was an AOE, didnt need to be targeted and u could start casting before mobs were in range. Now it plain sucks =(<br />
And the knockback is not long enough to push mob out of melee range, so it will continue bashing on the tank.<br />
 <br />
In solo situations, 1 min durations is just too short to be of any use.<br />
 <br />
Pity, i was really looking forward when this spell was an AOE and it was a big delusion=(</div></div><hr />
