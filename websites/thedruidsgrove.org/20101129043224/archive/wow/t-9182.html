I find it quite quiiiite weuird that @ lvl 60, a single ring has more armor than an entire suit of lvl 1 armor! AN ENTIRE SUIT! IN ONE RING! I mean I find that embarrasing. When I was playing FFXI, I would laugh at some people when there entire set of armor was worth like... 1 of my daggers (I had gotten LL 3 times, at 400,000 gil each, I was stinkin rich) I just find it odd that a small ring has enough protection to out-armor a noobs entire set of armor. Even noob like... metal mail has less protection in some cases, and that covers your entire armor!<br />
&quot;AHA! MY PINKY HAS MORE ARMOR THAN YOUR BODY n00b!!!!!&quot;<br />
