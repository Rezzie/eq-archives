<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-06-2006, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what is some good AQ20 Feral Gear?  I'm behind a firewall and bored at work today.  I know about the rep set, but what are some good drops?  Someone mentioned that a good helm drops of Moam, and I just got some good gloves off of Kurinax (toughened silithid hide gloves i think).<br />
<br />
We've been clearing MC a lot, spending a lot of time learning BWL and running ZG in our spare time, and haven't spent much time in AQ (unfortunatley I can only raid 3 or 4 nights a week MAX).  Just starting to get into it, and its a lot of fun so far.  Have cleared up to Moam.  Also, if anyone has any tips on any of the fights, that'd be cool.  Kurinax is cake, so is Buru, occasionally have some trouble on the general if fears dont get off in time or something.<br />
<br />
I am trying to get my feral gear set better before I respec heavy feral when the expansion comes out.  Currently have every single high ac and ap piece from instances pre ZG and AQ, and though I'd give my right eye for a Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark, doesn't really look like I'll be getting that any time soon.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

My guild is about on pace with yours - we've cleared ZG ( Jin'do &amp; Edge of Madness included ), MC, and took down Razorgore last night.  AQ we've downed Moam, Kurinaxx, Buru and Rajaxx, Ossirian is still kicking our butts ATM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I gotta get me those boots, helm and chest piece.  Wow.  I've got the epic wristguards of stability from MC, so I'm happy with those.  That choker of the shifting sands is really nice too...<br />
<br />
Gratz on taking down Razorgore!</div></div><hr />
