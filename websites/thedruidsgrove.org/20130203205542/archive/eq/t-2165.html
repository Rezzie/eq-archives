Ok I know many of you are skeptical about this but I THINK I know how to do this encounter solo. Now before any of you begin to rant and flame THINK CAREFULLY about it because you may just end up eating your words as I am going to try this today. As you already know (or SHOULD KNOW! ^__~) Faydedar is required for the druid epic, which at level 59 I have yet to recieve. Yeah Yeah I know but I'm not in a guild and no one on the server seems to want to help me =( lol<br />
<br />
So lately I've just been reading up on things and how people solo'ed them and I know this will take many tries before I finally get it, but in the end it will be worth it for me. <br />
<br />
By now you are probably thinking about the old exploit people used to solo him, but my idea is perfectly legit. <br />
<br />
---The Idea---<br />
<br />
We all know Faydedar has a 500 damage AE/Dispell. Now with me not having dire charm it would be practically impossible to solo him BUT keep listening, I think I have devised a way to beat him with just Call of Karana and normal druid buffs. With that said I will now explain my idea. <br />
<br />
What I plan on doing is charming a raptor and keeping the raptor healed/buffed while he takes out Fay. I plan on having KEI for mana and possibly Aego/Focus so if charm breaks I won't be killed right away. I charm and buff the raptor, swim to the oasis, summon my pet to me, turn in the froglok essence and engage. Now here's how I will work things out from there.<br />
<br />
---The Action---<br />
<br />
First things first. Thinking ahead, Faydedar will obviously dispell charm. What I plan on doing is this.<br />
<br />
First I charm the raptor and CRAP buff him. Once crap buffed, I will break charm and dot him. At this point his buffs will look something like this:<br />
<br />
dot<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
<br />
Now is when I charm him, which makes his buff set up look like this.<br />
<br />
dot<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
crap buff<br />
charm<br />
<br />
Now I wait for the dot to wear off and give him an extra crap buff THEN I completely buff him to full potential and commence the attack. With the buffs set up like that, Fay will be unable to dispell charm and hopefully with all his buffs I will be able to hopefully take out Fay solo. <br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
In conclusion I would like to ask what everyones ideas on this are. Do you think it's possible? Please try to hold the flames as this is simply an informational post and all I wish is to recieve the comments of others. So if you think I should do something different, then by all means let me know! Thanks and hopefully you will see me with my epic next time I come here!</div></div><hr />

You won't be able to re-charm.  I don't know what a raptor's hps are or damage, but it better have a lot.  I think Fay will eat a raptor.  Just get a group of friends together to kill Fay.  Fay not that hard with 60+ levels and aa points now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bismuth</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll probably end up having to spend too much of your time during the fight buffing/healing your pet in order to do the quick damage on Faydedar that would be required.  Your raptor's damage output won't be enough, since anyone trying to solo Faydedar would be relying on faster DPS.<br />
<br />
Another prohibitive factor is that at level 59, you'll probably have to spam chloroblasts since I doubt it would be possible to keep up with heals on your pet with Tunare's Renewal.  That won't be enough healing to keep your pet up for long...<br />
<br />
Also, just FYI, summon companion doesn't work on charmed animals, but only summoned BooBoo.  You'll have the added annoyance of holding a raptor's hand all the way to the inner island.</div></div><hr />

Also I don't think the pet would have the dps to get Fay's hp moveing at a good rate. And you would want the moist hp/mana for this and that means lvl 65 =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Triz Wiakicyoazz</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so I tested things out to see how they would work eariler and this is the information I gathered.<br />
<br />
1.) I charmed a Vicious Raptor which hits for 115 and fast with Savage Spirit.<br />
<br />
2.) I was able to kill 3 raptors before my pet's health was at half. Each raptor hit for 100-115.<br />
<br />
3.) You're right, Summon Companion doesn't work on Charmed mobs but I was able to get a raptor to walk all the way over there. I charmed him, sow'ed him, broke charm, and ran over there. He was pretty much right behind me the whole way.<br />
<br />
4.) With resists I'm sure my pet would be a formidable force against Fay.<br />
<br />
I know I could just get some 60+ people to come help me but whenever I ask someone they say &quot;How many people do you have&quot; or something to that effect. When I tell them however many they usually respond with &quot;Come back when you have more&quot;... I'm not in a guild and not only would this be a great feat for someone to accomplish but it would also be a nice reward =)<br />
<br />
I suppose tommorrow I will try to take him out. Today was just testing out the limits of things.<br />
<br />
[Edit: Also it's good to remember that Faydedar runs when at about 10-15% health. If I can take him down to around that before my pet dies then I can finish him off with dot's/nukes. Another thing is that Fay has only around 32k hp. If my pet hits for an average of 100 double, then thats 150 hits. With Savage Spirit he attacks about every second.]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xendrix</div><div class="date">03-13-2003, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also remember that you have to be in melee range for your spells to land.  If Faydedar is running, it is hard to work it out to where you are in melee range when you are at the end of your cast.  I personally think you have an extremely low chance of success, but more power to you.  Get 5 friends to help and it should go pretty smoothly if they have decent levels, AAs, and resists.  If you can't gather 5 friends for 30 minutes or less, well then I don't know what to tell you.<br />

And with a bard along, it is cake. Forget your strategy of charming a raptor...your mana will drain to zero trying to heal it with crappy TR. Charm will break, you will be oom, and dead.<br />
<br />
I was able to complete epic guildless. You can too. Just have friends in the game from grouping, duoing, etc. and ask them for help. People are often happy to help someone complete their epic with a simple fight like Fay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd have better luck getting a level 65 enchanter to try and charm the Iksar Master (not sure if it's possible).  He used to kill the normal Faydedar solo all the time when Fay would path too close to him :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maporfic</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 07:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I am sure a druid can solo Fay. It is only a matter of time before it happens, so who wants to be first?<br />
<br />
I don't think CoK will be enough due to the wear off = summoning bit. But with Dire Charm and proper buff stacking it should be doable. The druid will likely need some AA points into healing abilities, and a KEI. <br />
<br />
2 items that will help a ton = Bracer of Hidden: insta cast see invis on pet for junk buff AND the Key to Crypt from PoD: insta cast resist diseas buff on pet. Fay only dispells up to 2 buffs at a time, IF the aoe is not resisted. <br />
<br />
I summoned up Fay yesterday to check some things out. I lasted a LONG time kiting him around AND my bear pet lasted 15 minutes too (mostly due to really bad pathing I think). Fay hits max for 230ish (doubles). With 114 fire resist I resisted more than 3/4 of the aoe's. <br />
<br />
Somthing to think about: Fay has been duo'd by a warrior/cleric team, prolly more than once. IF you were to DC the named raptor: Dino, he has about 8k hp, and doubles for 115ish. Haste and buff him up and you got somthing very similar to that warrior. <br />
<br />
Tunare's Renewal would be your heal spell without a doubt. doubles for 230?? That is weak by today's standards. TR will do a great job of keeping mr Dino alive. I think the only challenge is gonna be having the mana to keep him alive for the duration. <br />
<br />
I toyed with the iksar master a bit just for kicks as well. He is a nasty sob. Runs FASTER than soe, very high MR. LVL 61 I think. I do not see how a chanter could possibly charm him. I could not get a snare on him for the life of me (literally). Maybe Tash would help, but you would die a dozen times just trying. He does not see invis, and he WILL attack if you get close to him. Single hits for 380ish, and kicks for 270's. <br />
<br />
Another thing to try is giving 2 different 1hs weapons to your raptor pet, he might quad. Also, get some pet gear from a mage for extra haste (summoned weapons are nice for pets). <br />
<br />
In the end it is likely easier to just spend 20 minutes in tell hell grabing every NICE person you can find to help kill Fay, but to solo every Cleansed Spirit would make it feel that much better every time you clicked on your epic effect. <br />
<br />
Don't give up if this is what you want to do. <br />

I shouldn't have even told you guys because I knew you would just flame me for trying something different. Anyhow today is the day that I'll actually try to pull it off... yes I will have to hold the raptors hand as he walks to the oasis. I did it yesterday. It takes about 3 minutes. Alright well I'm off to eat some breakfast then attempt it... Wish me luck :)</div></div><hr />

Nothing wrong with trying something hard.  Lots of folks automatically ruled out soloing summoning mobs (not as much since we got better AAs) but many Druids have been doing them for forever.  So go for it.  You really don't have anything to lose except some time and a little xp.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, don't dismiss reasonable advice as &quot;flaming&quot; because it doesn't reinforce your idea.  You'd be wise to listen and learn.  I would bet a root beer float that a Druid could solo Fay right now without exploitation.  But what some folks are saying is that you may lack a couple of the essential tools (better heals, AAs, gear, etc.) to be that Druid.  But that's what makes EQ so much fun, that everyone has the option of trying.<br />
<br />
Heh, enough of my Tony Robbins routine ;)   Good luck!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kineada</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Soloing Fay could prolly be done.  You will need to be 65 with a lot of toys though (meaning you won't want the epic by the time you can do it).  Also, this won't be true solo since you'll need some other buffs (Symbol, Focus, Brells, VoQ, SD, etc.).  You should have around 7khp, LR5, ID5, SotW3, WoW3 and prolly all the other stuff as well.<br />
<br />
First off, you will need some insta-clickies.  You will need all you're spells and you will need a few stacks of insta-heal shaman potions.  You will need a whole slew of free damage items (epic, DoD bracer, Tempest Blade, sporecaller, etc.).  And you will need to max out your DS (potion, SotW3 and WoW3 whenever it pops up).<br />
<br />
Yep!  I'm talking about ye olde porcupine method.  Find a nice corner to wedge yourself in, you are going to have to channel all your spells.  You will need to time the bashes and kicks so your spells have a reasonable chance of going off.<br />
<br />
With a whole mess of luck and some perfect execution, you will be the first druid to have a Fay head mounted over your fireplace with gold-leaf lettering:  Solo'd 03/14/03</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bjond</div><div class="date">03-14-2003, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My 56 monk has tanked stuff that doubles for up to 380 only healed by a cleric's CH (Juliah for 9th ring quest).  His HP was only around 3700, so TR really would have done just about the same on him as real CH -- I don't think CH ever hit when he was under 1k hp.  The only real significant difference for Faydedar would be the AE.  Your pet is likely to get hit for full on the AE even if you buff his resists.  He'll also likely have lower DPS than my monk, but far more HP.  You won't have to worry about your pet dying because TR isn't fast enough and you'll likely get full value on every TR.  Charm breaking, pet being feared, and resists are your major issues for solo'ing it.<br />
<br />
If you get Dire Charm first, that would eliminate half of your worries.  I'd try it with a DC pet in a second .. worst case you just gate out if you get summoned.  You can almost certainly channel a gate soon enough to live.  Fay is a real pansy.<br />
<br />
BTW, you might be able to try a few tricks, like pulling Fay to the house and rooting him so his AE hits and agro's the NPCs there.  You'd want to make sure you relog once you root him and he agro's the NPCs to clear your agro.  You don't want to get summoned once Fay starts getting hurt.  Assuming Fay is tougher, they might really soften him up a lot.  Some of those house NPCs are moderately high level.</div></div><hr />

Then when they don't even get flamed, but merely disagreed with, they whine about being flamed.  Furthermore, you said you're doing this because no one would help you, not because you're trying something out of the ordinary.  In that case, arguing with people who suggest you bring a group is just stupid.  Perhaps that's why you can't get anyone to help in the first place.  Anyway, I'm sure there are druids out there who can solo Fay, but you're not going to do it at 59 ... end of story.  32k doesn't seem like a lot when you have rogues and wizards, but it's a whole different world when it's just you and a raptor.</div></div><hr />

If one pet drops the other will keep argo so the other druid can get control again.

One thing i didn't see mentioned at all was the AE Fear.<br />
<br />
Sure with halfway decent MR you'll be able to resist it, but all it takes is one bad fear and you'll be looking at a cold run back.<br />
<br />
Having tried to duo fay with a 63 Rog (NToV + Ssra Gear) and me 62 Druid (hodgepodge of gear, pretty bad by most standards).<br />
<br />
First attempt went bad, Fay to 60 when fear lands on me (178 buffed MR), short duration but long enough to through off the TR cycle, rog dies, I die. Find out the hard way that fay didn't depop for atleast 14 hours (Test Server, may be different on the productions).<br />
<br />
2nd Attempt, Fay to &gt;20 percent but due to low rog health Fay didn't run, again fear lands mid TR (210 MR this time) rog dies, I die. (Bring in a 60 ranger, 65 cleric, kill fay, after summoning corpses).<br />
<br />
Lowest number of people I've succeded with is 3 (63 Rog, 62 Mag, 62 Dru), this one wasn't even funny.<br />
<br />
All of the above duo / trio attempts were done with just druid buffs, and clickies.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to DS the pet... the 2nd Failed attempt we would have won had we remembered DS (It slipped both of our minds), had we had it we should have won.<br />
<br />
So again best of luck on your solo attempt, you're more crazy than I.<br />

<br />
BUT, consider:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are in range to heal a pet, you will also be in AE range, and you will get debuffed and fire bolted;<br />
&lt;li&gt;dispelling doesn't always happen in top-down fashion, so eventually that charm WILL get dispelled no matter how hard you try;<br />
&lt;li&gt;even with a super MR setup, you'll get feared occasionally, and that will interrupt any spell in progress, making TR very unreliable.&lt;/ol&gt;Personally, I think you will be eaten alive in 15 seconds trying this, but if you're prepared to waste two hours setting this up only to die, go for it.<br />
<br />
If you really want to succeed, you should probably think more towards the level 65/uber gear/porcupining idea, though that's also quite a long shot.</div></div><hr />

Even at level 60 with crap gear I can probably do it (Well it isn't really crap gear... I have 255 wis unbuffed and ~800 AC with ~1600 HP... all those unbuffed)... Anyhow yes as soon as no one is camping him I will let you know how I did...</div></div><hr />

I forget.. is Fay slowable?  if so then my guess would be that a shaman will be the first class to solo him..</div></div><hr />

This is my first time ever attempting to solo a dragon so my obvious first choice would be Yeldema. I got her down to 50% with 80M left over and pet at full health when I got a cragwyrm add... I just gated because it wasn't worth it to try to kill both of them. Best way I think to pull her is stand in max melee range, hit her once, run back to beach where pet is and /pet attack. Yeah you'll get hit once but the dragon won't summon you while your pet is beating on it trying to take agro from your snare ;)  <br />
<br />
Soon enough I will take her down...probably tommorrow, (She seems REALLY easy...) and I will start doing other dragons. I know I won't have a pet that good for Fay but I want to get the basics down first... And yes I know Fay is way harder that any WW dragon except Kland and Sont but like I said, this is my first time. I want some experience in doing it =P<br />

<br />
  I have been on many Fay kills and most went fine.  I do think you can do this but with alot of pre work.<br />
  <br />
  I have a question.<br />
  <br />
If you charmed a raptor and took it to the island and left it   will the raptor there stay or leave?<br />
<br />
This is what my idea is...  Not sure how many HP raports have or how long they will last in a fight but,.....<br />
<br />
1.  Bind where the raptors are.<br />
2.  Charm one and bring it to the island<br />
3.  Start fight and use raptor to hold fay<br />
4.  Gate back to raptors and wait for your charmed raptor to die<br />
5.  charm another one and bring to fight ( this have to be done really fast )<br />
6.  send new charm raptor in and you gate back to get another.<br />
7.  keep this up till it Fay is dead.<br />
<br />
  I have done this with other mobs but never a Dragon.<br />
and I have never used Raptors.<br />
 <br />
Let me know what you guys think.  mabe?<br />
<br />
Grrr solo Fay Grrr  I will do it some day !</div></div><hr />

At 55, my monk/druid could duo the warlord room with some difficulty -- at 58/58, it's trivial.  The trick for it is to use harmony to pull.  You can get singles every single time that way and space out the room before you move inside.  Also, before you start, be sure you clear all the roamers outside the jail.  They can and will heal (including CH for some) through the walls and that can force you to evac.  Once you move inside the room, you won't have to worry about them.</div></div><hr />

I had a guildie who needed him so took a group to do it last night. It has been a long time since I fought fayd last so I was prepared to grit my teeth on a one group encounter...<br />
<br />
Boy was I ever wrong. The first surprise that came to me was that at 65, Fayd is now light blue. Had no chanter there so I was running with PoS and regular RM up. Resisted all the Dragon Roars. I was dispelled a bit though. The dispelling did not go in a linear fashion. I had the clicky item from CoD quest in the top slot. It lasted the whole fight. In fact the only 2 buffs that were dispelled were tranq and Stalker, which were 4 and 6 slots down respectively. Imagine that...<br />
<br />
As for the group, it was a high powered group to be sure. 65 warrior with 70 some aas, 65 rogue, 64 beastlord, 65 druid (myself), 65 druid (who needed Fayd), and a 61 shammy who forgot to get in melee range to cast, so Fayd never got slowed. Through a non slowed Fayd, the warrior took 2 KRs. He had no cleric buffs so was sitting in the neighborhood of 5-5.5k hp.<br />
<br />
Now, a few things that have already been covered here. A raptor won't have near the hp/ac/resist of this warrior. Since the dispel was not from top to bottom, it's a crap shoot as to whether or not charm will be dispelled. If charm is dispelled, it shouldn't be a problem to get out alive. and if charm goes the distance, well, there's victory. If you have sufficient lvl, I do not think that the fear should be an issue. At 65 with average gear, I believe only Sont and Kland have landed a fear on me, and then rarely, but Sont moreso than Kland. <br />
<br />
I'd be willing to give it a shot at soloing Fayd, but this would mean camping another froglok essence, which is not difficult, but not something pressing since I don't know of anyone who needs epic anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this can definitely be done, so keep trying. You may want to gain a few levels before you seriously try it though.</div></div><hr />

  I have been talking to another druid friend. He says, mabe she can be spawned and you leave.  She will then attack other stuff and take damage. When you come back mabe she will be weaker and thus you will stand a better chance of a solo.<br />

He just sits on the beach if you dont engage him. I have seen him despawn within 20 minutes of a wipe AND I have seen him stay up over an hour after a wipe. <br />
<br />
I have spent a bit of time toying with Fay, thinking of ways to solo him (legitimatly). If you try to pull him out of the inn area he paths into a wall. He has a short memory, so if you get out of agro range he will heal up and forget you until you get back into range.<br />
<br />
Normal Fay spawns within 24 hours of a patch (or so), then paths to the Iksar Master within a few hours and gets killed by him. Normal Fay respawns in about 7 days. Does NOT drop druid epic piece and has very very crappy loot for a dragon. <br />
<br />
After a few more weeks of AA's and I get my 2boxed cleric to 49 (for rez's) I plan to give Fay a few attempts solo since i actually still need his drop. <br />
<br />
Of course as soon as soemone does it, expect a nurf. <br />

I got trained by a bard a few months back who's group had lost to fay and who wanted to get the silly lizard out so they could CR.  Heaven only knows why, but she assumed for some reason that no one was camping raptors, and as I had soe debuffed before I realized that there WAS a dragon behind me, it wasn't long before I got to make the run back.<br />

The point to the story is that you can get fay out to the master, though I have no idea if you could time anything closely enough to get the kill through anything but luck.<br />

<br />
  I have an update for you guys on a Fay solo.<br />
<br />
I took control of the camp this weekend.  and setup the kill for Sunday evening.  The turn in guy is on an 11:00 hr spawn for sure..  I clocked it.  <br />
  With about 30 people it still was a hard fight.  the avg. level was about 56.  <br />
<br />
  I know that he will do the following during fight<br />
<br />
1.  dragon roar.<br />
2.  dragon breath.<br />
3.  fear you.<br />
4.  summon you.<br />
5. dis spell you of 5 or more buffs<br />
<br />
I am very sure that is mob is not soloable.  <br />
<br />
The only way that I can see him being soloed is for you to...<br />
<br />
Not get dis splled<br />
Not to get feared<br />
Not to get summoned<br />
Keep what ever Pet Tank healed and not take argo from pet.<br />
Some way or another to slow him.<br />
<br />
If you guys have a idea that could do all this and more please let me know.  I would love to here it.<br />
<br />
Oh yea I died in the process... but we did kill Fay!<br />

Not to get feared <br />
-- High MR and high level.  a 65 with 150-200 MR would have little problem resisiting Faydedar's fear.  Dunno about the pet.<br />
<br />
Not to get summoned  <br />
-- Let the pet keep agro.  This is sorta critical to the 'i solo'd fay' plan as it was presented above.<br />
<br />
Good luck to those who try this, if any ever do.  <br />

<br />
Get summoned, run for 3 seconds, cast nuke, get summoned and hit for a round, run for 3 seconds, rinse repeat.  <br />
<br />
That being said - wyverns are light blue and have about 8k hps, barely hit me, are snareable and dont have dispel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fay hits for a maximum of 225 - it is his AE that does most of the damage.  If you resist it you don't have a problem at all.</div></div><hr />

I don't think any of the raptors are 51+, even the named one, right?<br />
<br />
Truncheon of Doom requires level 50 and is 2-handed.<br />
<br />
Swarmcaller requires level 46 and is 2-handed.<br />
<br />
Locustlure requires level 46.<br />
<br />
Anyone know the level range on the vicious raptor?  Allakhazam lists it as 43-45.<br />
<br />
Another question...is Faydedar stunnable?</div></div><hr />
