<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">10-13-2009, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of questions,<br />
<br />
Level 80 will remain the cap?<br />
<br />
(2) New races - Goblins &amp; Worgen - to be leveled from 1-80?<br />
<br />
The &quot;face&quot; of all 4 continents will be changed forever?<br />
<br />
What will we do with our 80 toons - new content?<br />
<br />
Will you guys roll new toons?   <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to a Worgen Mage.  I would have preferred a Shaman, but alas, I'm alliance all the way.  <br />
<br />
I'm also looking forward to leveling another toon on par with fellow guildies.  At this point in the game, we all have alts that are so scattered level-wise, that it's hard to level with people.  Can't wait to get back into Kara with my peeps!  <br />

<br />
I'd still pay for the privilege of a naked level 80 with no rep/skills. I know I tend to be in a minority on this but I really don't enjoy the levelling, it's a barrier to actually starting to play.<br />
<br />
I thought the new level cap was 85 (sigh, here we go again :()</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skwidrific</div><div class="date">10-13-2009, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, while i know *nothing* about leveling alts, my guildies have claims of 1-80 within a week /played. I would imagine that's with all of the Bind on Acount gear they can get. I've seen blue responses saying that the Bind on Account gear that offers exp bonuses won't work after level 80, so it looks like it's goign to be an honest grind for everyone to 85.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with Nellie.  I have a shadow priest that the guild wants me to level who's been stuck at lvl 41 for...months now.  It's really hard to find the time to level the alts in between raids and having our brand new pvp officer forcing me into arena skirmishes every time I'm ungrouped &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am the only person i know with 1 lvl 80 !!<br />
<br />
And i've played WoW since the EU Final Beta and then from Day 1 of its EU launch !<br />
<br />
Levelling is just painful. I dont have the time let alone the inclination to level multi chars like most people i know.<br />
<br />
how some of my guildies have 4 or more lvl 80's is beyond my capacity to understand !<br />
<br />
i have a 58 mage whose not levelled in prob 18 months. i do also now have a 66 DK and i will admit its faster levelling now with the xp u get from q's and the fact i now use questhelper and tom tom. plus heirloom items. but even so its taken a while to get to 66 and i can see it taking my a long while yet to hit 80.</div></div><hr />

The next closest is my DK at 71.  Between trying to get the raiding in and RL...I don't have the time or the motivation to level an alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
got a lvl 71 alli alt and some lower ones, but they are just too painful to lvl .<br />
<br />
*makes a banner for the people with only one lvl 80* :gratz01:</div></div><hr />

<br />
my DL is now 67 :p and i've not even logged her in over 3 weeks !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">11-16-2009, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two 80 toons, my Tree (main) and my Shadow Priest (alt).  <br />
<br />
When I leveled the priest, I had to stop at around level 40 - she was excrutiating.  Shoot, sit, drink x 1,000,000.<br />
<br />
I placed her aside for about 6 months, then rolled up me sleeves, logged her back in and got her leveled to 80.  The moment she dinged 80, I literally did a happy dance around my desk.<br />
<br />
Now she's pwn.  <br />
<br />
I certainly understand why some people prefer to have only one 80 toon.  It is a lot of work.  But there's something rewarding about being able to say, &quot;which toon do you need?&quot; when a 10 or 25 man is being put together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raging Epistaxis</div><div class="date">11-17-2009, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My holy/prot pally just dinged 80 four nights ago, my first alt to get to max level (60, 70 or 80 when they were max).  I'm still waiting on the pwn part.  <br />
Well, ok to be fair AoE mob grinding is pretty fun, but taking 5 minutes to kill a same level elite = not so much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magellan19</div><div class="date">11-17-2009, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My holy/prot pally just dinged 80<br />
<br />
Gratz on that!  <br />
<br />
I, too, have just rolled pally with the same spec(s) in mind.<br />
<br />
I'm learning quickly, however, that it's a very complex class and I need to invest in a &quot;How to Level a Paladin book for Dummies&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Since the world is changing to such a drastic degree, do you think Loremaster will still be attainable?<br />
<br />
It's been a curiosity floating around our guild since BlizzCon and I haven't really found any info.  I was curious if anyone's heard anything.<br />
<br />
@ Gwyth, &lt;3 the banner!</div></div><hr />

<br />
but kalimdor one is 240 quests to go.. go fig :banghead_</div></div><hr />
