<br />
I am at work right now and as I am behind a WebSence Block like some others in the forum i can not help with my input right now, sorry for the inconvenience.<br />
<br />
For those of you with my same problem here you have an item db that is not yet blocked ---&gt; http://wowd.org<br />
<br />

Thrall's Resolve(if you're horde)<br />
<br />
The Arathi Basin Pvp Reward set is very high armor. If you manage to get to exalted the shoulders there are 258 armor.<br />
<br />
Warden Staff<br />
Unyielding Maul<br />
<br />
At'alai Spaulers of the &lt;random&gt; - Sunken Temple for these, they can be farmed by a solo 60 druid, but tough on the drop rate.<br />
<br />
Slaghide Gauntles of the &lt;random&gt; - From the boss that spawns from the ogre &quot;event&quot; in LBRS(the pike and Omokk's head). Tough to do 5 man, but you can bring 15 and still get the gloves.<br />

The WoW boards are down right this moment, but try this thread too: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx?fn=wow-druid&amp;t=296661&amp;p=1&amp;tmp=1#post296661<br />

It's mostly cat gear type stuff and feral gear, but it's a huge list of potential gear for druids sorted by slot. It also includes more end game stuff like Malfurion's Blessed Bulwark /drool</div></div><hr />

Mine are 'of the Monkey', generally 'of defense' is the most coveted by druid tanks, but all have very high AC.<br />
<br />
You'll definatly want some Defiler Boots and Shoulders (I wear the belt aswell, less AC then Lava but better stats overall for what I do).  <br />
<br />
The Animist Gear in ZG is another good place for high-AC-leather... boots, pants and shoulders.<br />
<br />
Mark of Tyranny from the Rend head quest.<br />
<br />
Warden Staff or Unyielding Maul.. wanna buy the Warden or do DM north runs for the Maul... Staff is slightly better, but they're pretty comperable.<br />
<br />
I can get to 11.5k AC if I wear my tortise band (which is usually sitting in the bank)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One blurb from it this is supposely the highest armor you can get, if you enchant with armor and agi on everything.<br />
<br />

If you barkskin and then direbear that means you will have 20% + 75,41% = 95,41% Damage Reduction?</div></div><hr />

enchants and armor patches are applied after the shift..they are not part of the bonus</div></div><hr />

There are no diminishing returns, or at least it's small enough to not worry about. It's been explained over and over. For a very simple, layman's view of it, read this short explanation: Warriors: There is no Armor &quot;cap&quot; (http://conquest.teamgbu.com/viewtopic.php?t=470)<br />
<br />
For a well-backed mathematical analysis, I suggest reading this post: AC and diminishing returns (long) (http://wow.forums.thedruidsgrove.org/showthread.php?t=9476)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bovus</div><div class="date">01-15-2006, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While your arguement is interesting, I find it mostly esoteric as it ignores several points:<br />
<br />
1. All items in the game have certain stat point allocation (remember the defense nerf circa 1.7 or 1.8?), and selecting an item solely on the basis of it's Armor means one is likely sacrificing stamina, resistances, or other stats.<br />
<br />
2. Few &quot;boss&quot; mobs rely solely on physical damage.  Armor's mitigation affects only physical and not spell-based damage.<br />
<br />
3. +Defense items have significant, proven benefit (speaking PvE).  The most important are miss increase, crit reduction, and crushing blow reduction.  Armor, by itself, does little to reduce spike damage.  Against bosses, mobs that mortal strike, or simply melee-heavy elites, avoiding spike damage from back to back crits is preferable, in my mind, to reducing the number of times healers drink from every 3rd pull to every 4th.<br />
<br />
4. Overheals - even with mana conservation tools like those in CTRA, some % of heals in a fight are extremely likely to be overheals.  When you are dealing with damage mitigation of such small amounts as 10% per hit, it's possible that an average group/healer wouldn't ever see the benefit, as it is absorbed through overheals.  I speak as someome who primarily uses HT Rank 6 in MC.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, ignoring key stats important to tanking (%hit, %crit, stamina, defense, and dodge amongst them), is foolhardy.  The only reason to strive to achieve 10K armor is simply the end itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elkwood</div><div class="date">01-15-2006, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm have u done much tanking  bovus ?  WHile u bring up some very good points the  defense thing and ac thing is way off base.<br />
<br />
For warriors its different. They get a bigger benifit out of defense then we do. Yea we need some but i found through playing around that my base +23 defense i have from gear is fine. Anything over that and u start to take big stat hits to make it worth while.<br />
<br />
For as ac goes. More the better long as u dont kill off your other stats to bad. I found that 12k range is pretty good for mc, THough i do alot of my tanking in the mid 11 range. Just depends on how much  resist gear i need or if i feel i need alot of ap for one reason or another.<br />
<br />
Btw i not saying u cant tank with less then 10k ac. Just saying that its a big difference between 9k bear tanking and a 12k bear.</div></div><hr />
