As I have stated in other posts I solo 99.9% of the time and have only run the Stockades twice with a group. I am currently attempting to solo the deadmines and have run into a snag. I have never run it before this and have found that I can not get past the door in the chamber beyond Rhahk'Zor. I can kill him and open the door behind him but in the next chamber there is a door that is always closed and I do not know how to open it??? <br />
<br />
Can someone shed some light on a nooberific druid PLZ</div></div><hr />

If yes, turn around when you reach the cannon and go back the way you came, and take your first right.  At the end of this short tunnel you'll find some gunpowder on the ground.  Pick it up and use it on the cannon.<br />

You still have to fight that group but you can single pull them once they path back.</div></div><hr />

If it's not opening for you, chances are you or the server or the instance is bugged.  Try resetting the instance and check it again.<br />

With a group, you have to leave the instance, break group, regroup then reenter instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here's how I do it.<br />
<br />
1.  Everyone in the group zones out.<br />
2.  Everyone apart from the leader leaves the group.<br />
3.  Someone other than the first leader invites everyone again.<br />
4.  The person who just did the invites zones in first.  Once they are inside, everyone else zones in.<br />
<br />
This method has always worked for me.  I don't know if it can be made simpler than that or not..<br />

<br />
a) I want to see how far I can get solo<br />
b) It is a very quick way to level my weapon skills.<br />
<br />
I will see if giving it a day or so rest if I can get past that part.</div></div><hr />

After the run down to the shredder, unfortunately I had to go back to work before I had a chance to take the shredder on, I hearthed out and disenchanted all the greens that I got ended up with 17 strange dust, 5 greater esssences, and a small glimmering shard. Thanks for all the help.</div></div><hr />
