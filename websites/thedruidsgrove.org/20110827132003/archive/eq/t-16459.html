I am now 67 haven't played in a while, haven't charm kited in even longer(I am social player, I get to talking and there goes my night). Have had trouble getting my 65+ spells, mostly from lack of effort and or grouping. What spells should I be using in my line-up......don't even know any of my spells post-65, haven't played my drood in probably over a year. Anyway, thanks for your help on the subject.<br />

I guess I could look my spells up, but then that would be too easy.</div></div><hr />
