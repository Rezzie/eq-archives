I am firm believer in getting some basic aa's out of the way over straight leveling. (healing adept springs to mind along with heal crits ....obv scm is a must)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
If you are soloing and do not have a strong desire to see 75 you have hit some of the nicest root/kiting areas (sorry I loved HoH).<br />
 <br />
If you have a guild or group of friends that you always group with or that is helping you getting some levels and gear will increase your survivability a fair bit. AA's help define the way your character grows. Are you a healer, buffer, or do you want to work on your dps.<br />
 <br />
If there are spells ahead of you that are game improving and that you want, or an AA that you really want to get then work for them.  There is no right or wrong.<br />
 <br />
What I have found thru leveling various toons and classes do what YOU want and have fun.</div></div><hr />

I solo, group, main heal, backup heal, buff, port, and dps. I try to do a little bit of everything and am in a family-type guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being in a family type guild, I would suggest that you take a look at who you typically group with and try to stay in their general level range. It can be very frustrating if your friends leave you behind - for example they all hit 69 and start grouping in RSS and you are level 66 and can't zone in. Conversely, if you level up and they don't, you might find yourself bored grouping with them because their optimum exp mobs/zones will become light blue.<br />
<br />
I have leveled a number of alts, including recently a Paladain and with the exception of Run 3 / Metabolism, I went 100% exp up to about 70 then did a few other important class AAs then went 100% exp til he hit 75.  Of course my situation is very different because I have a number of alts, all of which are 75 and most of which have over 1000 AAs so it was easy to level him and made no sense not to.</div></div><hr />
