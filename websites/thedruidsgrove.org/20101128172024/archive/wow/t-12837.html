From a druid perspective, it seems as though, Howling Fjord is &quot;better&quot; as the trinket rewards are nicer (138 blues instead of 138 greens).  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
Also, what's up with factions in LK?  As of today, none them show purchasable items.  Is the whole faction reward system changing in LK?</div></div><hr />

Actually for a feral druid I LOVED the Green trinket called Deathknight's anguish.  That thing is just amazing with our attack speed.  its got a decently high proc rate too.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I have no idea what's up with factions.  I got to exalted with Valiance whatever and it never had anything purchaseable.  There are supposed to be vendors, but maybe they are keeping that stuff all under their hats for now.</div></div><hr />

Your spell damage will probably be a good deal more now... so.... you should be able to solo using non boomkin form spells and solo pretty decently.  Some holy priests were talking about how soloing for them was pretty easy using Smite etc.  The damage is a great deal more now that you don't need a dps set.</div></div><hr />
