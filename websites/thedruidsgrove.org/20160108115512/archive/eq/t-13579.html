 <br />
For the Druid epic 1.5, I had just received the Aninmated Heads Scroll in Tox forest. I was reading 8a of the 1.5 quick reference and read left to right, instead of the other way around. As a result, I combined the Soul Stone and the Aninmated Head Scroll in the Mangled Head in Tox Forest instead of the Feerrott. I got back the Animated Heads Scroll and that was it! I tried to talk to the &quot;compelled spirit&quot; in Feerrott but could not get him to talk to me. <br />
 <br />
Does anyone know if:<br />
1. Can you fail the Epic at this point?<br />
2. The combine location is crucial to the completing this section of the quest?<br />
3. Can the compelled spirit be spawned without the combining in the Feerott?<br />
4. If the combine is working correctly, and I combined int he wrong location and lost half the parts for the quest, do I have to restart the entire Epic 1.5 quest?<br />
 <br />
Thanks in advance . . .<br />

I would think that you really do need to do that combine in the zone, as some druids early on did this and found themselves in the need to redo the quest or petition.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Nimchip about petitioning. But, I would expect that you will have to redo this part again :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TenadenFirestorm</div><div class="date">03-22-2006, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the responses all. I had petitioned before I posted this thread but knew they would take a day to respond. (As usual) They were no help. The GM said I must do the combine in the Feerrott. I will have to redo the combine, which means I would need the Mangled head. <br />
 <br />
I lost the mangled head in the bad combine so I will need to do all the steps needed to get it back, which in turn means I will need to go back to step one. <br />
 <br />
One note, it would be better if 8a of the 1.5 quick Reference warned about doing the combine in any locaiton but the Feerrott. <br />
 <br />
Thx Again, Tenaden</div></div><hr />
