<br />
1. Bears are very hard to snare if you don't have your L69 DoN chromatic snare, Serpent Vines. If you don't have it, you need to use your animal MR debuff or have a player in your group MR debuff the bear first.<br />
<br />
2. Pull the bears from the lake edge up to the plateau where there is plenty of room to kite. Think drakes from Cobalt Scar.<br />
<br />
3. Your cold rain spells will, of course, be ineffectual. Load up your spell bar with dots and Solstice Strike.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to add, be cautious.  Almost everything past the gate in Valdeholm is KOS, but you don't have to go through it to get to the quest NPC.  The door to enter to reach him is at -1641, -1032, 86.</div></div><hr />

I left and went down a tunnel and a giant picked me up by my neck and set me back to the Strongarm room. . heh heh at least he did not kill me.</div></div><hr />

&quot;LOADING PLEASE WAIT&quot;<br />
<br />
This weeks episode is titled: <br />
<br />
&quot;Notes On Farming Icefall Bears For Frosted Quest Drops&quot; <br />
<br />
About a dozen bears spawn at the shores the lake and about 3-4 on the plains next to the lake. Pull them to the plateau above the lake, not to the plains next to the lake. Why? Two very good reasons why, my friends: <br />
<br />
1 - Wolves on the plains that are amiable to rangers and druids will assist the bears if you get too close to them. <br />
<br />
2 - A named (Hunter) that quads for 3350 roams the plains (and summons!). <br />
<br />
<br />
Next week on &quot;LOADING&quot; <br />
<br />
Silverfur's corpse_02: &quot;Hey, think I can quad those red cons while you tank the named without healing back up, Cade?&quot; <br />
<br />
Cadence's corpse_02: &quot;Sure! Inc on -&quot; <br />

Killing the xxxxxxxx of Zek in Frostcrypt can raise your factioin.  I kill (or rather, sit outside of the group praticing 1hb) about 20 of them and get back to dubious.</div></div><hr />

He would cast Bone Strike,  I dont know what it does as it never landed on me. I swear he was kiting our Pally around. He would run out aggro various wolves and bears on us then summon, run out and summon. Was a longish fight but we got him in the end. He dropped a belt for casters.</div></div><hr />

Note to Bear hunters:  There are also adult cave bears near and in a cave on the East side of zone (near crevice with spiders).  Just have to watch out for one wandering dire wolf, Grimjaw (Named wolf), and that Tarnuk Farwalker dude.  If you kite the bears closer to the side of mountain you should be OK for the most part.  If not... well...<br />

So you can get 2 bracers.   I dont know if this was from the new faction patch, but just collect as many ivory tusks as you can and keep doing that quest till you get amiable faction and get a 2nd bracer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">serinity_inny</div><div class="date">03-01-2007, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm before it used to be you had to do all 4 tasks (CoS, runed diamond, ivory tusk and this) to get character flag then you could repeat it over and over (did10 bracers for faction) but pre-patch post patch went from warmly to ally in one tusk turn in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elric91</div><div class="date">03-02-2007, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">after reading this post i went to thentil strongarm at dubious faction and requested the task again and he gave it to me. (shrug)<br />
 <br />
did the turn in and got another bracer and i have never done any factioning of any sort and other than this bracer task.<br />
 <br />
the only other task i ever did was the runed diamond so unless there is some sort of bug it looks like there is no factioning needed to get a second bracer and at most the only other required task would be the runed diamond to get the task again.<br />
<br />
i know after i got my first bracer i tried to get task again and he would not give it again..then there was the faction patch and i went back and tried again after i read this forum and he gave task no prob so im thinking either stealth nerf, or since i did the runed diamond after i did bracer it might have unlocked it again like a task arc, or it could be a bug.<br />
 <br />
    <br />
                              EDIT:<br />
 <br />
     ok..i can now confirm 100% there is no required faction other than dubious, and there is no pre-requisite tasks or any other task progression arc needed to get a second bracer.<br />
 <br />
     i just took a lv 70 shammy guildie to icefall recently and he had never done any tasks at all in valdeholme other than when he got the first bracer. we got him 4 pelts, ran to valdeholme , and at dubious ,and with only having done the bracer task he was able to get the armor supplies task.<br />
 <br />
    he did the turn in and got the second bracer, so it looks like we are looking at a nerf. we can simply have 2 bracers now, and i for 1 think this is great, after all the negative nerf hits in the past its cool to finally see a positive nerf to a quest.</div></div><hr />
