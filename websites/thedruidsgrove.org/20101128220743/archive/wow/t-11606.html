Im just curious about this.<br />
Which would you like as your tank in a dungeon/raid?<br />
A warrior (any spec) <br />
or a feral druid</div></div><hr />

I have been given many compliments and am on tons of peoples friends list now asking for me to tank this and that. Even going so far as pointing out the impression that bear tanks are better now than a warrior. It will be interesting if this continues after the nerf, but I intend to continue tanking as often as I can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(note: not that I've come across such a pet, but I'm just sayin *g*)</div></div><hr />

Don't forget about paladins either.<br />
<br />
The more love a paladin gets a tank will also break the &quot;warrior only&quot; tank concept and give more room for bears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I'm on healing duty, I've healed for lots of warriors and some prot pallies, prot pallies can be awesome tanks as well.  Never healed for a feral since I'm the only bear tank I really know xD</div></div><hr />

Your probably right about that, aslong as you have a good healer :)</div></div><hr />

Especially now that I've respecced to Balance.  Most warriors don't want to tank.  They just want to do &quot;mad dee pee ess in their pee vee pee&quot; gear.  I'm having a blast egging warriors in the expansion to respec back to prot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hope I know how to tank.</div></div><hr />
