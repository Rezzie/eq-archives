In the previous path, my att power was 969. I crit 1400-1500 consitantly with ravage and ferocious bite. Since patch 2.01. I have 1000 attack power but ravage hits for 500-700 consitantly.  Only difference is I know have leader of the pack. I thought this would increase crits.<br />
<br />
Why am I suddenly not hitting hard at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Right now my AP is at 1188 and my crit is 22% i think. My Ravage usually crits somewhere between 1700-2100. My Ferocious Bite seems to crit for less, say between 1400-1700 but that does depend on how many combo points and energy If I remember right. Mangle crits between 600 and 1200.<br />
<br />
 All I can think of is double checking the gear that you have equipped and double checking yoiur talents but im sure you have done that already.</div></div><hr />

I have a guildy who has almost 100 attack power less, 0.3% more crit chance, and he crits higher, and all the time. He often pulls agro off of me cause he is hitting way harder.

Wish I didn't hit like a little girl now lol :). When i crit, I do crit hard 1900-2100ish. But its rare. Kinda a shock, like &quot;holy crap! i crit! Screenshot!&quot; kinda deal lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Relevart</div><div class="date">12-17-2006, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a talent in deep feral that increases the damage of your melee crits.  If you didn't pick this up, you'll notice that people hitting for less are critting for me.  As for crit rates, since the pathc, I've set every single critline record.<br />
<br />
Ferocious bite - 2495<br />
Rake - 369<br />
Maul - 1257<br />
Mangle(Bear) - 1490<br />
Ravage -  2886<br />
Shred - 1423<br />
Mangle(cat) - 1570<br />
Claw - 1059<br />
<br />
<br />
Some of those were set up in duels (i.e. i faerie fire a mage, wait for stealth, trinket, tiger's fury, and ravage, or mangle) but everything else came from pvp.  All level 60 targets.</div></div><hr />
