<br />
 We hit a couple of the good Horde cp farming groups and they did beat us. However because it was a hard fought win for them they started afk'ing out whenever they would see us after that. As the day went on more groups started AFK'ing when they saw us come in, sad really, but we were rolling then 3-0 almost every game.<br />
<br />
 At the peak of the evening we had an average queue time of 2 minutes, and matches were only lasting 5-10 minutes because the hordlings kept AFK'ing before the match started.<br />
<br />
 We had two druids in our group all day long, one being myself. with a preist and or a paladin by our side we simply could not be stopped it seemd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It takes away the realism of a war there.  &quot;Oh I'm not ready for your attack - AFK&quot;<br />
<br />
Good job on winning although I do like the horde better.</div></div><hr />

It seems that alot of people are just in it for the bonus honor, not the actual pvp competition and fun.</div></div><hr />

Playing a game solely to advance and not to have fun.  Once you have everything and the best of everything if you didn't have fun doing it, I don't think you will have fun with it.</div></div><hr />

Druids rock in WSG.  Got caught yesterday in the 40-49 bracket against a horde group with at least 4 druids, it was scary.  To see a pack of them come rolling up in travel form or pop out of stealth, or stack 4 MFs on me, was a sight to behold.  they pwned us but good, but it made me proud to be a druid.<br />
<br />
At one point, I found one of them alone with our flag on their roof.  It was a long drawn out fight of hibernates, Mf's and heals, which I eventually lost (he had 2 levels on me).  But between my finding him in stealth cat, him going bear for D, me going Moonkin for armor on offense, him bash-healing me, and my hibernate-healing on him, my OoC, his roars, etc...; we pretty much used every move in the druid book and it was a blast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry about the afk's.  In my opinion if you afk in the BG's you should be given like a 2 hour penalty or minus honor (like a dishonorable kill gives).  There is no sense in holding up the line for others so that you can go in an not play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buttons</div><div class="date">01-30-2006, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have AFK'd out of a few WSG's....but not because of the other team....because of my own team.  I love the Horde side....and there are some awesome players on the Horde on Dalaran....but then there are some that make the WSG experience miserable.  As much as I love WSG and all....when I see a majority of those that make the experience horrible.....I AFK.  I play WoW to have fun....so I'm not going to pay $15 a month for those people to ruin all the fun.<br />
<br />
With all that being said...(sorry I had to rant....that's been happening way too much lately)...Druids rock WSG!  Hibernate/Entangling Roots/Travel Form/Sneaky Cat Form....I love it all!  I have made a low level priest though that I want to try in WSG also.  I actually have quite a few alts mainly for WSG....it's just so much fun.  When you find a great group....it's a blast to spend hours and hours playing.</div></div><hr />

But I dont mind losing in WSG if its a good fight and not one sided.  Although rolling over the other side can be fun as well I know they hate it as much as me.  I find Nature's Swiftness is so helpful in WSG, dont know what I would do with out it.  Having a instant Root, Hibernate, or Healing Touch is just priceless.  Though I find after the 5-6 time you root/hibernate them while running with the flag they tend to jump you every time they see you.</div></div><hr />

Now if I cap the flag just once the Alliance group up on me with 5 guys.....kinda sad that they have to gang up on me....haha!</div></div><hr />
