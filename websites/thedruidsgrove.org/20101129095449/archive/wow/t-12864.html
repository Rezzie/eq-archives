<br />
I have a sPriest Tailor, and I'd like to make my set, but I'm told to hold off until the expansion.  Apparently there will be a better set available to make.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after I make whichever set I can make, I'm thinking of giving up tailoring for Inscribing.  <br />
<br />
I've had mixed reactions on this decision.  I absolutely hated leveling Tailoring (I did it for my set that I'm STILL undecided about) and inscribing looks to be fairly straight forward since my Priest and Druid are both Herbalists.<br />
<br />
BUT, I'm told that I can make good money off of Tailoring and since I've already gone through hell and back to level it......<br />
<br />
I just don't know.  <br />
<br />
The only thing I do know is that there is no way I'll give up Alchemy (on my Druid).  Good Grief, I could not imagine life without Alchemy.   <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

From one perspective you can make money off it.  Everyone is going to want Glyphes, but if lots of people do Inscription the market will be flooded with Glyphes and the odds of making a good profit have yet to be seen.  Now the parchements you can make for enchanters??? Those might sell really well.  Every enchanter is going to want to be really friendly with an inscriptionist so they can sell their enchants on the AH.<br />
<br />
Tailoring for a clothy I think has always been somewhat superior.  They typically make crafted gear that is really useful.  There are typically things you can make and sell at any point.  Inscription is kind of a wild card at this point.</div></div><hr />

Engineers have goggles, LW have wrists, JC have rings, etc.  What the heck do I get if I'm an inscriber?  An off-hand, that I can't use as a Feral?  Access to Darkmoon Fare cards?<br />
<br />
The shoulder enchants seem sort of week, but if no one else gets shoulder enchants, then it might be worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, thinking of that, does a DK have to level herbalism from the beginning if he combines it with Inscribing?  Because, if so, there will be a lot of DK's running around fighting over Peacebloom.  :grin:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solarflash</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also keep in mind that if you dump your tailoring your priest will no longer be able to wear that &quot;specialty&quot; set.  So I would make sure that you have replacement gear ready.  <br />
<br />
I made that mistake with my mage a while back...I wanted to start creating shadoweave cloth to sell and soon realized my spellfire set no longer would equip!  <br />
<br />
Well thats a quick way to blow a few hundred gold....oops.<br />
<br />
I would reccomend waiting for your DKnight, maybe rolling a lowbie alt now to farm up some plants to quickly level inscribing but, the Dknight will already be a high enough level to powerskill all the way to 300 without having to worry about leveling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-02-2008, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a SW tailor on my Warlock.  haven't used it in ages, but the FSW set was amazing to start in, and it was nice to be able to make 18 slot bags for myself, my alts and all my banks.  <br />
 <br />
In wotlk Tailoring has the option of 'weaving' certain enchants into cloak.  The spell damage one is a chance to inflict 1000 to 1200 holy damage to your target when you land a cast.  Which seems OP to me, I'm sure there is either a crazy internal CD or absurdly low proc rate.  (i'll search for the other tailoring cloak enchants and edit them in)  Either way, I'm keeping tailoring, and I'm sure there will be some nice new craftable gear available (which I'm sure will require xxx skill to wear like fsw).<br />
 <br />
Enscription gets to use another glyph (major I think).  Which is pretty rad as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charnas</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ended up dumping alchemy for inscriptions on my druid.  I'm ok with the slightly increased shoulder inscriptions as the perk.  I am also really loving having recall scrolls, and being able to make scrolls of agility.  My priest is ench/tailor and being able to make vellums helps out a lot, as i no longer need to find somebody else for the rare enchants that he has.  I'm really leaning toward picking up tailoring as well, and dumping herbalism once I get inscriptions up to lvl 450.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Yeah, I love this change.  Was really annoying having to find someone to enchant all my other toon's gear, and then tipping them 10g+ for some of the rare enchants that my main had.<br />
 <br />
I'm looking forward to actually being able to make some money now with enchanting too by selling the enchants on the AH.  I'm gonna put a couple Executioner's and +30 Spell Powers up on the AH this Weekend :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so wot needs to go with Inscription for someone with only 1 high level char to make it worth it ?<br />
<br />
i make nice money from my Herby so would need convincing to drop that and altough my LW is not great i am hoping Wrath brings some good new patterns etc and not all BoP !<br />
<br />
btw with inscription if u buy a glyph its lasts til u replace it ?  they dont have number of uses or anything silly do they ?<br />
<br />
i assume you can replace them by putting another over it like u do with gems ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From what I've seen, the main mats are herbs for inscription.  <br />
 <br />
Right now inscriptions are selling for very cheap on my server cause 239586 people are leveling it.  I suppose this will change when the 'uber inscriptions' come out at lv 80 and are attainable through rep or something.  <br />
 <br />
There are no 'charges' on them, you have them permanently until you want to change them.  Changing them, as you said, is exactly like changing gems (which I can see happening a lot for people who switch back and forth from a pure PvE build to PvP build.  If they implement double specs, they should implement double inscriptions.  Maybe thats the money sink...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charnas</div><div class="date">10-17-2008, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inscriptions are locked in until replaced.  Think of it like another &quot;talent&quot; choice I guess.  I think once you've capped out inscription you really don't need a massive amount of herbs, and buying them on the AH wouldn't be bad, either enchanter or tailor would go with it, as they really don't have a gathering profession requirement.  If you pick up anything else you'll be dumping a bunch of money on the AH just to get your skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">10-18-2008, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok thanks.<br />
<br />
i'll see if i think i need to give it a go.<br />
<br />
depends if i finally level my stuck 57 mage whose a herby as well as my main.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inscription hasn't been bad, but thus far its kind of a &quot;meh&quot; profession.  Extremely easy to level if you are doing it on the way up, but just kind of &quot;meh&quot; overall.  Its great to have for the guild and you're horde of alts, but just doesn't feel that strong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tlbj6142</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hoping they add something neat-o to inscription with LK, right now you really only need one inscriber per server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-20-2008, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah pretty much agree with your statement.  I promised myself I wouldn't power grind it this time like I did Jewelcrafting.  I'm glad I didn't.  I'd imagine we'll get some special &quot;inscription only glyphs&quot;, but beyond that, you don't need a ton of Inscriptionists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charnas</div><div class="date">10-29-2008, 08:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there are some decent offhand items for casters with inscription.  That and the I find myself burning through my scrolls of recall quite frequently as I've been running about working on achievements :)  It's also a nice source of agility scrolls for those classes that use those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Allahanastar</div><div class="date">10-29-2008, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From a caster's perspective... most of the off hands are complete crap.  I've been trying to figure out if they are worth using, and mostly the answer is no, no, no.  I'll hope they have some nice epic ones eventually worth using.  <br />
<br />
I should specify my character is level 66 and bomkin.  Having a choice of offhands at that level with +Fire damage or loads of stamina with no other stats isn't particularly enticing.</div></div><hr />
