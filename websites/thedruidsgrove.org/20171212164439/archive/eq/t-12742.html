There's a few wanderers that are pretty much always single.  Snare (preferably Mire Thorns/Serpent Vines) first, then root with Spore Spiral/Savage Roots (or one then the other... ornate pants are $$).  Probably just a warping mob you caught though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellen</div><div class="date">11-30-2005, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a warping mob... the way the path across the bridge can be tricky.  If you pull them such that they path off the ledge they'll either pop back on bind or pop on you.   If you run to far ahead of them while running down the bridge I believe what happens is you seperate the vertical distance too much and it thinks you're trying to use an exploit / get into a safe spot so it warps onto you.<br />
 <br />
Normally when I do those for the first mob I'll stand to the left side of the bridge (so it doesn't try to cut across gap and fall off) and cast immo to get it's attention then run down the bridge... about half way I'll turn around to make sure it's not gonna run off and start to try and get snare on before it catches up.  You have to get used to it as you'll have broken line of sight depending on where the 2 of you are.</div></div><hr />

Essentially, the mob must follow you painstakingly across the bridge in order to avoid a warp.<br />
<br />
If you walk the mob off the bridge, it will warp onto you.  This is so regardless of where you are standing.  If you are levitating, and walk even slightly off the edge of the bridge, even for a second, the mob will warp to you, hit you, and fall to the floor beneath.  When it hits the ground, the mob will then warp to your location again, and slap you around some more.  Good luck surviving a string of hits over 1k in damage :)<br />
<br />
The only safe way I have found to pull them is to ensure both you, and the mob, are on the bridge at the same time.  As it's a zigzag bridge, this limits the amount of distance you can put between you.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, I can't solo there reliably because the casters are too tough.  They gate when you get them close to dead, and I can't come up with a way of reliably stopping this (while solo).</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I used to ivu my necro and just run him into the tunnel on the other side of the bridge.  I can't confirm you can always IVU across those first few mobs, but usually easier to break in from the other side.  Best option imo is to go to Tshara room if it's not up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayuna</div><div class="date">11-30-2005, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another tip, gating mobs won't gate if near their bind, so if at all possible... fight them rooted right next to or on top of their bind point.  If the mob is bound right next to 3 other mobs, either be prepared to root CC all of them (it's fun sometimes, try it!) or don't pull it.  Patience really pays off on pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arrturis</div><div class="date">11-30-2005, 11:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I solo the nest quite often (as a necro) and I generally do what kamion does. Invis vs undead to the Tshara tunnel (that area is reletively safe). Two mobs path close to each other but if you wait for them to path away you can pull the dragon one and kill it. Once you've killed the first mob its simple kiting (although you might want to use the walls to give you a bit more turn around space).</div></div><hr />

The mobs can't fall off the bridge, that's it. All of that camp is pullable without warping and/or getting hit. There's at least one double pull, but if you can handle one, you can handle two.<br />
 <br />
As far as I know, there's no casters among the cursed / fallen stuff at the door. Might be wrong tho..<br />
 <br />
Getting an instance to solo is good tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Netura</div><div class="date">12-01-2005, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are casters at the door in non-instanced. Cursed can be enchanters or clerics, and I believe all fallen are wizards. The Corrupted Drakes are never casters.<br />
<br />
I often use the warping to help me pull, hehe. Can also use it to split the double pull, if you can figure out how to do it. Its not too hard to be honest, just snare the one you don't want, run directly over the edge and then back onto the bridge so the unsnared one warps onto you...then run down the bridge and snare the one that warped. The other will have most likely returned to its bind spot; if you did it right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, pick up a potion or poke someone with IVU for a cast. Sometimes the undead just before the door will see through, but that can't really be helped until you clear them. I go near T'Shara's room. The hallway just outside is a safe area.<br />
<br />
The Nest on that side is pretty extensive, with live and undead mobs. Enjoy exploring!</div></div><hr />
