<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ubara</div><div class="date">03-28-2005, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a lot of talk about leatherworking and alchemy, but I hadn't seen anyone posting about engineering, so as my intro post I figured I'd give that a shot.  :)  I've enjoyed reading these forums, so I hope I can contribute in some way.<br />
<br />
I finally settled on playing a Druid Engineer after experimenting with a bunch of other classes and professions: a Holy Priestess and Seamstress (my &quot;main&quot;), a Warrior Alchemist, a Rogue Engineer, a Hunter Engineer... at this point, engineering was becoming pretty addictive, and while the guns and bullets were great for the hunter, and the target dummies great for anyone, I actually missed serving in the healing role.  <br />
<br />
Since I've pretty much enjoyed playing all the classes, and have a couple of friends who play various flavors of Druid, I went and rolled myself a Tauren Druidess -- who, I vowed, would be an engineer.  <br />
<br />
Why?  Not for the firepower, but mainly, for having a means to resurrect outside of Rebirth: Goblin Jumper Cables.  Engineer  headgear, while cloth, is helpful -- especially when you're wearing it already at level 17!  As mentioned before, target dummies can be quite helpful at crucial times.  Having an Ornate Spyglass gives me something akin to the shaman's Farsight (or the Hunter's Eagle Eye), and which is usable indoors.  The list goes on!<br />
<br />
The next question will be which school of engineering will I aspire to?  Goblin or Gnomish?  I'm currently leaning towards the latter for a variety of reasons, but it's far enough down the line that I've got plenty of time to think.  <br />
<br />
In any event, thanks to the admins for setting up these boards, and thanks to the readers for your time in reading my little essay.  :)  Happy hunting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have no stun while in caster form which i spent most of my life in since bearform wasnt that great then...bombs were a must have for me when soloing healer type mobs or just a nice AE when having more than one target.<br />
<br />
Plus is was really the only tradeskill that looked fun...drops and quest items were always as good or better than anything I could of made myself for armor.</div></div><hr />

Atm I am doing mining/blacksmithing mainly for armor/weapons for friends and keys for myself.  I also want the blacksmithing anti-fear trinket.  I will try it out for a bit and if I don't like it I will drop it for ench, get a smoking heart of the mountain and then pick engineering up.  Overall, engineering is fun but, like so many things, is useless to us except in caster form.  Mainly I plan on getting it on my druid for the shrinking device :)  tiny-tauren at your service :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kulothar</div><div class="date">06-16-2005, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I made some practice targets on an alt the other night just to skill up and send them to my druid primary. A bit later had a bad pull and got 4 mobs.  I finished off one mob and was planning to run so I dropped one of them and all 3 mobs turned and attacked it leaving me alone so I decided to heal up and go to work on them.  Basicly it turned a possible death into an additional 3 kills.   Later, doing an instance on a near wipe I dropped one and it had the same affect.   The mechanical chickens are fun to play with also.</div></div><hr />

The fruits of any other profession are for sale at the auction house. Want a nice crafted piece of armor? You can buy it. <br />
 <br />
I just feel enigineering gives me an edge, and all the devices can be a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

I think harvest reapers are the reason I leveled up faster then so many other people I knew, from 30'ish to 40'ish they really help the grind.<br />
<br />
For druids Gnomish &gt; Goblin engineering imho.  The gnomish deathray seems to be made for druids with root and heals, the gnome chicken lets you summon and forget some more dps and healing doesn't break the shrink effect on the world enlarger.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eridalafar</div><div class="date">09-29-2005, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Engineering for a druid = gadgets, bombes and limited pets (mostly). <br />
<br />
You can also make firearms, but as druid we can't use them. Most of the armors are for plate or cloth user (we can't use or we lose a lot of AC).<br />
<br />
Usefull to have another AoE attack (the bombes) it was one of the only way for a druid to get it, but soon every druid will get huricane (1.8 patch).<br />
<br />
The big differences between gnome and gobelins are:<br />
<br />
Gnome: more gadgets and a portstone to Gadgetzan.<br />
<br />
Gobelin: more bombes and a portstone to Everfrost.<br />
<br />
As a druid, I find the port to Gadgetzan a lot more usefull (we have the Moonglade port that is near of the Everfrost city) and we are getting more content in Sitiscus (that is near of Gadgetzan).<br />
<br />
The gobelin's engineer can create a better resser trinket, but the gnome's engineer  can use it.<br />
<br />
Gogo gnome engineering!!!!<br />

The trinkets, potions/special items and armor in extra let me about 2 and half empty bags of 16 slots.<br />

The free space in the bank is a lot rarer as I am putting all items I am sure that I will not use this play session. I realy can use a lot more of space in the bank.<br />

Still trivial to pull off if you already have a high level character..  I'll just send all my retired 12-slotters to my lvl 20 alt..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sundry amusement:  Eat deviate fish until you get the Shrink Effect and then use the world enlarger.   Ever seen a cheetah half the size of someones foot?  ;)<br />
<br />
Gnomish Battle Chicken is a sleeper.   Pop it in pvp and people laugh at it for doing the constant 1 dps.  About 10-15 seconds after you release it, it gets pissed, turns red and starts kicking 60-70 damage per second.   Root your target, back off and let the chicken go to town.<br />
<br />
Gnomish Death Ray!  Unexpected weapon and let you take down the L60's when your still L40.....  (if it doesnt backfire and kill you).    I've taken down a lot of people using this baby and have had very few backfires.<br />
<br />
Ultimate laugh attack....   Mind Control Helmet!     I get more Alli's screaming at me for this than any other thing I do.  Get an Alli just outside of gadjetzan, or any other alli town, hit him with Mind Control (which is actually pet control) and then send him to attack his own Wind Rider!!   I've done this to enough L60 alli in gadgetzan that they avoid me when they see me now.   Most times the L60's are dead in 15-20 seconds. =)<br />
<br />
Bots, Transponder, Parachute Cloak, there is just waaaayyyy too much to do as a Gnome Engineer and backing it with mining both saves and makes you money.    Druid Engineer is definitly the way to go.</div></div><hr />
