 <br />
I can buy ceramic shackles in the bazaar but they're still pretty expensive, I'm only just 66 though so would get use out of them.<br />
 <br />
According to Lucy there aren't that many options beyond the stone augments and the only BA5 one I've seen is up for 200,000pp, well out of my reach.<br />
 <br />
I saw someone mention favor points in relation to this subject on an old thread. Is that LDoN and what did he mean?. Is there something you can buy with the points for BA4/5? (yes I have been away that long).<br />
 <br />
 <br />
Edit: On further research it seems DoN might hold an answer. I can fin Muram's anger as a magic based augment but is there a fire one too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is also a qvic drop, mask of the chaotic void (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68819)<br />
30% up to lvl 67.<br />
<br />
edit: you can always use your tribute BA5.</div></div><hr />

I've never used the tribute system but it turns out thats a great to do it while I farm some crystals rather than buy them. You can get tons of tribute for a few hundred plat in the bizarre.</div></div><hr />
