<br />
I just hit lvl 63 this week and I am finally getting around to buying either Mask of the Hunter everquest.allakhazam.com/...spell=1565 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1565) or Mask of the Stalker everquest.allakhazam.com/...spell=2887 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=2887) for the 3 mana regen per tick.  <br />
<br />
My question is, do they stack with Form of the Howler everquest.allakhazam.com/...spell=1562 (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=1562) which currently gives me 2 mana regen per tick?  If they stack, getting 3ft for the 10k these spells go for is a decent bargain in my opinion.  But if they do NOT stack and I just use it as an upgrade, I am paying 10k for FT1.  <br />
<br />
I may still buy one of them, but it lowers these spells on my priority list, especially since I am also looking for Protection of the 9 which is a 2 mana regen per tick upgrade to my current Protection of the Cabbage.  <br />
<br />
If anyone has both Howler and one of these Masks and can tell me for sure if they stack or not, I will be grateful.<br />
<br />
Thanx,<br />

All 3 of those spells are in slot 3, so don't stack.<br />

  Get Mask of the Stalker, Howler doesn't work indoors at all and Hunter can't be cast indoors.</div></div><hr />

Also if you get a horse or a drogmor to help with sit aggro for healing you'll find it especially useful as you can't be in wolform and sitting a mount at the same time.  I have Mask of the Stalker and love it, and don't miss wolfform one bit!<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind though: do you plan on reaching 65 soon and do you think you might be able to get some 65 spells? If that's the case you might want to wait and get Mask of the Forest which is 4 mana tick. A druid guildmate of mine got his copy for 5k, but I think he was especially lucky as I usually see it for much higher than that, but it is an option you can consider if you don't want to spend the money on the these spells that might someday find themselves at the very back of your spellbook.</div></div><hr />

Or Mask of the Stalker if I didn't want to wait.  You can't always use form of the howler in every zone.  Some zones are indoors.  In fact a bunch are.  So that in mind Form of the Hunter is an exp grinding buff as most raid locations are indoors.<br />

They are all multi-hour multi-death raid targets.  IE you can die several times while in them and not be able to rebuff any outdoor only buffs.</div></div><hr />
