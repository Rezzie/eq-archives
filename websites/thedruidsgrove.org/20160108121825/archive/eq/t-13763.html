<br />
3rd - Relic<br />
4th - before they patched to droppable I seen 2 in Arcstone, after patch I seen 1 in Relic.  May still drop in both.<br />
5th - Relic<br />
6th - Relic<br />
8th - Arcstone<br />
10th - Arcstone<br />
13th - this orb used to drop from the mob which you kill for 12th while in task.  I believe it was changed to not drop from that mob any more and is a trash drop in Relic, I could be wrong though.<br />
<br />
I checked Lucy to confirm drops on 3, 5, 6, 8, 10.  You can look up each on Lucy and it shows mob names that have dropped each.  It is not necessarily 100% accurate and I am pretty sure any of the similar named to those listed drop them also.</div></div><hr />

Back when PoR first came out trash mobs in Arcstone and Relic used to drop these.  A couple patches back they changed it so that ONLY named will drop them.  So if someone tells you that trash can drop them, they just weren't aware of the patch which changed it to named only recently.</div></div><hr />

Kaidman I remember that the trash was dropping these before patch unfortunately never took the initiative to farm for them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stratofortress</div><div class="date">04-27-2006, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I killed a red con 'trash' mob in relic a few days ago called &quot;a soul scream&quot; (I think) and it dropped a orb. I also thought that with the patch (when they become grey orbs and tradeable) they could/would no longer drop from 'trash' (none named with CAP letters), but my kill a few days ago proved otherwise.<br />
<br />
I am down to needing 4th and 13th (and Dao raid 1). Took five kills of Champion U and Tempest to get a 10th to drop.</div></div><hr />

Goofy the way we now have to refer to mobs as named even though they are just higher level trash and have no upper cases. /shrug<br />

Much hate for Stillsheen. Tempest is good.</div></div><hr />
