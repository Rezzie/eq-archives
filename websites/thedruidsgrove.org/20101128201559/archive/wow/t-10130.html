<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asclatorian</div><div class="date">02-22-2006, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So everyone on my server has told me to get AGI gear for my cat form.  When I hover over the stats in the character info screen, AGI is for ranged, higher % to crit and dodge, + armor and STR is for melee dmg and some other stuff.  Since I am melee with cat, it would make sense to me that STR would be the better choice, but I'm new so I'm sure I'm wrong lol.  <br />
<br />
So if I am 2/26/3 or (something like that) and I plan to stay feral until 55ish and will actually become a primary healer, which stat will help me tear down mobs faster AGI or STR?  Just want to know which and why.  It also seems very rare to find a piece of armor with both of these stats on it.<br />
<br />
Thanks guys : )</div></div><hr />

Str boosts your AP faster (2 for 1), but Agi increases your crit perentage.  Since your crit damage is based on your base damage, and your base damage is determined by your AP, you are best off getting more Str until you have an AP of several hundred (have seen different calculations showing 700-900 optimal), and then start focusing on Agility for the crits.</div></div><hr />

So since I have about 1k+ AP I should keep upping the agi.  Thanks again : )</div></div><hr />

<br />
How true this is, I don't know.. prolly just a matter of taste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say go for lots of agility mixed with a little strength up until you're raiding Molten Core and Blackwing Lair on a regular basis.  Once you're raiding end-game instances, switch to more strength.  My reasoning is that early on a lot of your damage comes from Ferocious Bite/Rip, and building combo points for these finishing moves faster is a big advantage.  Once you have access to lategame gear however, a large amount of Strength will give your shred and ravage abilities (which are based on a percentage of your base damage) such a massive boost that the damage from Ferocious Bite and Rip becomes almost negligable.<br />
<br />
[./edit]<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're into damage equations you can work out which items will give you more (net) damage.  We know for example that 20 agility will give you 20 attack power and 1% crit chance (plus some dodge chance, but tbh I don't really care too much about dodge).  20 strength on a feral druid will give you 48 attack power.<br />
<br />
Suppose you're trying to decide between 2 different breastplates.  One gives 20 strength and the other gives 20 agility.  The best way to work out which will give you more overall damage is to have no breastplate equipped, look at your damage, then equip the strength breastplate.  Look at your damage again.  Take the difference between the 2 numbers, and you'll have an actual amount of dps that 48 attack power gives you.<br />
Take the str BP off again.  Look at your dps.  Look at your crit%.  Now equip the agility BP, note how much your dps increased by, and note how much your crit % increased by.<br />
<br />
For 20 agility it will be 1% more crit than without any BP equipped.  Supposing with the agi BP equipped your DPS is exactly 100dps.  1% extra crit chance means on average you will get 1dps more from the extra crits you get.  So, we take the difference between the extra DPS the str breastplate gives you, and the extra DPS the agi BP gives you (+1dps, from the crit chance), and you have firm mathematical numbers on how much extra damage each will give you.<br />
<br />
<br />
However...  with feral talents, a crit on an ability that gives combo points will give you 2 combo points instead of 1.  This makes it a lot harder to measure, and I have yet to figure out a good method for calculating damage increases whislt taking this into account.<br />
<br />
Ah, damage..  I love damage..<br />

Note it demonstrates the basic rule that the higher your crit percentage already is, the more str will boost you, and the higher your AP already is the more Agi will boost you.</div></div><hr />
