<br />
It should be noted that all (?) PvP gear will cost you both Honor and Arena points.  The high-end stuff has rating requirements as well (which I'd expect).  But I don't understand the AP requirement on BG gear.  Maybe we can get AP from something other than Arenas???  World PvP???<br />

As many of you know we will be featuring a new Battleground, a dedicated world PvP zone and all new PvP items in Wrath of the Lich King. In order to make the transition from The Burning Crusade to Wrath of the Lich King flow as smoothly as possible, all accrued honor points will be reset at the launch of the expansion. We do this to ensure select players do not have an unfair advantage at level 80 from stockpiling honor to instantly purchase the newest Wrath of the Lich King PvP rewards. For those with unspent honor points prior to the release of the expansion, we will be offering a few upgrades and special rewards in next content patch solely for purchase via the honor system.</div></div><hr />

We had hoped that the introduction of some new Honor rewards in the upcoming patch would give players a great opportunity to spend any of their remaining Honor. However, many players would still be surprised by an Honor and token reset as it isn&#8217;t something we&#8217;ve done in the past. As such, we've decided to not reset Honor or tokens upon the release of Wrath of the Lich King. Players who save their Honor will be able to spend it on level 80 rewards, although those rewards will be significantly more expensive than their level 70 counterparts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it was correct that tokens and honour should be reset OR 'old' tokens and honour should not be able to be used for 'new' level 80 rewards....<br />
<br />
the whiners win again ! :(<br />
<br />
<br />
does that last sentence mean if you sue 'old' honour/tokens it will be more expensive to buy items than if you use 'new' ?<br />
<br />
or are they simply saying that at 80 in Wrath items are going to cost a lot more honour/tokens and take much longer to get ?</div></div><hr />

i've only been able to cope with the amount of pvp i've done for the relatviely quick way to epics !<br />

infact i'm currently sitting on about 15k so i might add a bit more to that int he next 6 weeks and see what items are available in Wrath.</div></div><hr />

Basically if you max out your honor before WotLK arrives, you will have a small lead.  Farming honor items should take roughly the same length of time, though..<br />

i think what Blizzard has effectively done (hopefully, anyways) is seperate the PvE'ers looking for, like you say a &quot;quick way to get epics&quot; (the term welfare epics is negative, yet accurate sometimes) and people that genuinely love to PvP... especially since (from what i've heard) resilience will be worth nothing in intances when the expac is released (but i'll be starting another thread about that shortly)</div></div><hr />

Just like we all balked at 1000g and 5000g pre TBC before we realized how easy gold was to farm (and how much gold is given from quest rewards).  I'm sure that at 80 we will get an increased amount of honor to compensate for the increased cost of gear.<br />
 <br />
On a side note, they need to introduce anywhere between 2 and 6 new battlegrounds to get people interested in playing them again.  Even if they have the same dynamics as ab and wsg, just a different setting or something.  The same 4 bg's for the past 4 years ... ugh.  Ideally they would come up with some new mechanics or concepts, but Blizz is adamantly a PvE oriented company, so I'm not holding my breath.</div></div><hr />

thats why i bought wow and participated in the original Final Beta !<br />

<br />
Now I hope that Blizzard does increase the honor rewards from BG's at 80 at the ratio that the equipment costs increased. I'm not a big PVP'er since I started playing on EQ which isn't PVP at all. I haven't seen anything official on this though.</div></div><hr />

Exactly the same as me. I love PvE, and have raidied all the way through AQ pre BC and BT currently, but just don't have the time to sit down 3-4 nights a week for 4-5 hours straight to raid. I play a lot during the week, but its sporradic - I'm on and off depending on friends / bars / girlfriend / work etc.  I hate turning down people who would call and say &quot;hey, come meet us at the bar, this awesome reagge band is playing&quot; because were just about at Mother and there is no one else on with a SR set.  <br />
 <br />
So PvP has become a very fun thing for me to be able to still play the game without having to sit in LFG forever &quot;Looking for tank / heals, can summon&quot; or spend 4 hours clearing the same raid zone for the chance at x loot. <br />
 <br />
Then again, come wotlk i'll be raiding naxx again, as I like to take advantage of everything. Guess having a balance (and multiple toons) has kept me playing for 4 years.</div></div><hr />

Eh, zergfests are fun for a bit, but get old (i.e. low level Warhammer battlegrounds).  Outplaying the other team based on superior strategy / discipline is fun IMO.</div></div><hr />

This made me lol.<br />
<br />
I agree with you, but it is so rare in practice as to be laughable.  AV is all farming bots now, no one plays defense in AB because it's boring, and all anyone wants to do in WSG or EotS is run the flag without regard for strategy.<br />
<br />
It's starting to look like pvp gear will be superior for tanking over pve gear again due to the high armor and stam...not looking forward to a new bg grind.</div></div><hr />

Sad but true.  Though I tend to run with a good / geared druid and rogue (RL friends) in a group of 3.  Amazing how much 2 or 3 players working together screws up the other team, and can win games even if all the other dbags in greens are fighting on roads or chasing flags.<br />
 <br />
Increasingly recently in pugs on BG9 Horde has been playing organized.  I've had multiple 600 honor horde 0 honor ally wins in AV, and countless 4 caps (surrounding ally at BS) in AB.  EOTS has been a failure for a long time.  WSG isn't really worth pugging.  Too much turtling / too many paladins.  I attribute bg's getting better recently to the good players coming back and grinding honor again to hit the 75k cap now that it's not getting wiped.</div></div><hr />
