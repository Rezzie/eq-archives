<br />
I have done all subquests but only have 26 of 27 bones. I am missing the Little finger Proximal Phalanx, which is supposed to be one reward for the Maidens Grave quest cycle.<br />
<br />
I have done all quests from these two times with no luck, only other bones were rewarded. I have also petitioned and the GM kindl told me I had not done all quests.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to find out which quests I still have to do? Just missing one bone really gets on my nerve...<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

After I wrote this I thought about the quest journal and went through all steps in the tasks I did. Obviously I had missed the Maidens explore task - after I did this I got the missing bone and could combine for the hand aug. Nice aug and great quest, one should just learn to read carefully, hehe.</div></div><hr />
