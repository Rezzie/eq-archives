<br />
I'm a solo (3 week old) druid and just turned 50.  I'm also a newb to the druid class and am usually a necro (so know well how to kite, good xp spots, etc).  Found single kiting mobs in Dreadlands got me about an lvl per hour or 2 (even after hotzones moved).  However, now at 50 that xp has fallen way off the radar, so where's the next spot to hunt.  I've tried Skyfire, Burninging Woods, Goru'Mesa, etc, but the mobs take about twice as long to kill as they did in DL.<br />
<br />
Next, how does one pull a quad kite?  I have the tangle wood shield (which I use to pull with).  Does this mean, pick one, snare, DoT, pick another, snare, DoT, etc up to 4 then lightinging strike nuke em (or targetted AE) while they're chasing you around?<br />

Thanks for the advice in advance too!</div></div><hr />
