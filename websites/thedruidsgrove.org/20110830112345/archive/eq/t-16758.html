I want to digital download the expansions. I wasnt able to from the site, does anyone have a link?<br />
I cannot access the borrowed accounts, but my two original accounts i started myself I can access.<br />
I just saw that I joined this site January 11, 2004, wow 4 years goes by fast :)<br />
This site saved my sanity, taught me to fight Elysians and helped me get my Epic 1.0<br />
I started in Eqdruids, then came here, any idea what happened to eqdruids.com?</div></div><hr />

Then you click a button (advanced ?) to bring up the options, and select all the expansions from it.  After that it's hours of downloading.</div></div><hr />

Thanks all for the assistance.........I am sure Nro, Sro, WC, EC, Oasis, SK, RM will be so empty you can hear the wind blow. Yes WoW was always busy with folks all over, but I miss my childhood. I miss the old days.<br />
So if Splitpaw gloves drop for me at the spires, hey, they may be worthless, but will make me happy.<br />
Hey....can you still hand in Deathfist Belts in Freeport?<br />
Than again, I am looking to b a Necro so wont help :)<br />

Fenier pretty much wrote off TDG (when he was CC) and I don't know if other Community Leaders come here.  We don't have CCs anymore; just &quot;community leaders&quot;.</div></div><hr />
