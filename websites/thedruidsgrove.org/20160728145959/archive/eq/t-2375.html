<br />
Generian = follow right wall until you are at the most north part of zone - around the 2nd and 3rd pusslings houses, put your back to the wall and straight across on or near to the opposite wall is where the planarian larva thats his ph pops<br />
<br />
I just killed everything from 1st pussling house to 3rd pussling house to get them. With a charmed rat this was a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm 0 for 45 on planarian larva and counting.  Between 2 group sessions and innumerable quick trips on my own, I've been actively searching for the generian larva for a couple weeks now.  I've killed every planarian larva on track, repeatedly.  I can't imagine trying to get a whole group flagged if these drop rates are &quot;normal&quot; but, /shrug, that's PoP i guess  ;) <br />
<br />
PoD can be a fun zone.  I've enjoyed the hunting there so far.<br />

I'm getting the feeling they borked the spawn table when they made there be more than one of the &quot;larva&quot; types.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quote:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;hr&gt;How to farm the PoDecay keys<br />
<br />
After about 2 days of doing this and figuring it out (along with help from Zenne and Wrenn) I have acquired the following information: <br />
<br />
You need 4 items for this key. These drop ALL the time off rare wurms in PoD. The mobs are on a 22 mins timer. The 4 wurms are: <br />
<br />
1. Harrior. Pher for this wurm is &quot;a malarian larva&quot;. When you zone into PoD look out towards the lake and follow the zonewall to your right. When you hit the shore thats your camp spot. A tracker from here can track these mobs and single pull them to you. <br />
<br />
2. Scavian. Pher for this wurm is &quot;a tsetsian pupa&quot;. Your camp spot for this is approx +1200 +550. Get a tracker and track these wurms .. or alternatively kill all the wurms you see if you have a full grp (slower preferred). <br />
<br />
3. Genesian. Pher for this wurm is &quot; a planarian larva&quot;. Camp spot same as Scavian above. <br />
<br />
4. Sengion. Pher for this is &quot;a tachian catterpillar&quot; but there are several of these. After some research alongside Zenne we believe we have found one that is actually the Ph. +1250 neg 575 is where we believe the PHer for this spawns. You can camp right near here alongside the zonewall. Alternative theory is there are multiple PHers in which case you kill ALL the tachian catterpillars near you. <br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
For point 4 both me and zenne found the named spawn at the loc we listed above. But since we never came back to pod after getting the keys we cannot confirm it 100 percent. But I am pretty sure thats where named spawns. So far I have never seen it spawn anywhere else.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronwann</div><div class="date">01-10-2003, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forget if it was the Sengian or Scavian, but whichever it was, I saw two of it up at the same time.  This would lend credibility to the multi-PH theory at least for that worm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maddux</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This guide helped me tremendously.  I managed to get all four in the course of about 2.5 hours, and was doing some xp at the same time.  I also got 2 ethereals off of the named, so i'll be hitting them even after this.  I assume this is extraordinary luck, but at least the spawn rate doesn't seem to be too bad.</div></div><hr />
