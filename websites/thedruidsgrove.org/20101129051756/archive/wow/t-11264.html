I actually went out and purchased a mouse with the two side buttons and theres also to buttons on top around the mouse wheel.  I love it.  I have every movement programmed to my mouse.  So, I can run by holding the two mouse buttons and if I want to strafe left i hold the left side mouse button down with my thumb.  Strafe right I hold down right side button with my 3rd finger(ring).  I also have back programmed on a button behind the mouse wheel.  I like being able to focus one hand on movement and the other all on my keyboard to select actions.  This has become second nature to me and I cant imagine playing without it.  Its easy to tell when someone is not on top of their movement skills as I usually run circles around them.</div></div><hr />

I left auto-run with Num Lock.  Q is bear, E is cat, R is decursive and T is travel.  Shift+F to mount.  <br />

I use the mouse primarily to pan the camera and click on things ofcourse ;)</div></div><hr />

I honestly feel like I would be really slow if I used the keyboard to move and select attacks.  Im not one to stand still i a fight so it seems that would really hinder my skills esp in PVP.  I love jumping behind people and attacking and then as they turn around I just jump behind them again and shred.  Ofcourse this dont always work because some people move very well but even at 60, some do not.</div></div><hr />

I turn with my mouse. I only have one button on my mouse and thats bound to travel form for easy access escape. In catform it's bound to stealth.<br />

I have everything mapped to keys, except soothe animal. I refuse to click on things as it gimps my reaction speed. ^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nit666</div><div class="date">11-12-2006, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use the mouse and the default keys depending on what form I am in and what is going on. I have a 5 button mouse with bear form on the left side button, cat on the right side button and travel on the top button. Makes changing forms a dream. The top two buttons are the default mappings).<br />
<br />
Also most of my hot keys are set up on the number pad as well as the default so I have access to three bars of spells using the number pad, Alt-numberpad, and Control-numberpad combinations. This can restrict movement a bit but I find that I can get around pretty good using just the keys when fighting and use the mouse when the target moves out of range or if I want to run away.</div></div><hr />

The only real customization to keybinds I have made are adding auto-run to one of my mouse buttons and toggling walk/run (yes...i know im a fag) and Shift 1-4 for shifting into forms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Droodz</div><div class="date">11-13-2006, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">dont feel noobish, the only reason i use the setup is because in the other mmos ive played im used to this, i wish i could have mouse one as forward, and mouse to as back =( but oh well, also a suggestion, use f1 f2 f3 and f4 for your different forms. that saved me a ton of clicking and time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">11-13-2006, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use default stuff too, although I gotta admit one of the reasons I suck in pvp is because my opponents easily outmanuever me so to speak, like run circles around me and stuff &gt;_&gt;  It's not a problem in PvE, but yeah :/  I oughta experiment with the mouse thing more, right now I just use the mouse for camera angles and clicking.  I changed some spell keybindings around a bit and just use them plus keys 1-7 or so(caster: F=moonfire, z=root, x=sleep, c=barkskin; cat: f=ravage, z=shred, x=pounce; bear: f=charge, z=demo roar), but that's about it.  &lt;_&lt;  I r noob too, I'm so not used to fancy keyboard set ups, cause I mostly play console RPGs, lol.</div></div><hr />

I have to resort to clicking on the icons with my mouse and it's really slow and ineffective!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uvgrin</div><div class="date">11-21-2006, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I set it up so the mouse &quot;forward&quot; and &quot;backward&quot; buttons are strafe left and right. I had them for something else before. This little set up has helped me the most I'd strongly suggest you try it out for a month or so. This frees up your other hand to do whatever you want. (such as drink coffee :p ).<br />
Here is the mouse I use cheap reliable and it works. The one I have is actualy quite old it was one of the first optical mouses out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nos</div><div class="date">11-22-2006, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I use a Nostromo n52 speedpad left handed controller.<br />
<br />
It has a directional pad I use for movement. With the software it came with, I was able to fully customize all the buttons I use to the 3 rows on the controller. For instance, my forward movement I mapped on the directional pad to use the numlock key (autorun).<br />
<br />
For turning fast, I still use my mouse (holding in the right button) for mouselook.<br />
<br />
It took awhile to get used to using the n52, but I can't see playing the game without it anymore.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: The software/controller has the ability to macro key sequences outside the game. I do NOT use this function and I suggest no one else does either.</div></div><hr />
