<br />
Any idea if this is just another boar mount with a different graphic or if this warhorse might move at a fast rate?<br />
<br />
I have no need for yet another slow mount but a free bard speed horse would be nice.</div></div><hr />

Different Graphic....now if they picked the graphic of the steeds in PoN I would be picking that one for sure.</div></div><hr />

Especially since last time I bought bought a retail box for DoD, Amazon didn't ship my box until three weeks after the expansion came out.  /rude Amazon<br />
<br />
So maybe someone knows what speed the new horse moves at?  Because if it moves at the same speed as the boar / slowest horse, I'll just do digital download.</div></div><hr />

I'll see if I can find it. Afaik it is the same speed as robo-boar out of the box.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ok found the reference. It was on caster's realm:<br />
&quot;...worth noting is that there may be an optional quest to improve the maximum runspeed of this horse&quot;.<br />
<br />
So nothing concrete about that yet.</div></div><hr />

Sprite - *jisahl_fennin* will the new mount have the same speed as the boar mount, or will this one be faster <br />
Rashere - For the Prophecy of Ro warhorse, I'm planning to allow you to turn in the claim item along with a normal bridle and receive a warhorse that moves at the speed of the horse summoned by that normal bridle. So, you can either use the base speed warhorse or get yourself a faster one through the turn in.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This quote is from the above listed link:<br />
Sprite - *Egras_Zek* You mentioed a way to turn in old horse for new style with /claim. Is this also the case for the Glowing Drogmor and Seru Horse? <br />
Rashere - I'm still debating on those. Those are loot items that represent a very specific creature, namely the fastest drogmor and horse available to most players, so I'm not sure if you should be able to turn those in and get a really fast warhorse instead. If you have a strong feeling about it either way, I'd encourage you to start up a thread on the EQLive forums and voice your opinion.</div></div><hr />

Can anyone get a few screen shots of what it looks like to be on a horse now days please? <br />
<br />
Or I could try the old frre horse quest again if I can remember it, lol.</div></div><hr />

No part of the horse is visible in first person mode now.<br />
<br />
I always used to shrink when I used a horse anyway, so that not much of the horse was visible.</div></div><hr />

In the bazaar stables, talk with Stable Hand Kyle.  Find the chest on the floor. Inside will be a Automated Barding Oscillator and a book.  Put your best bridle and the new one in it and hit combine.  I've seen said to leave the stables to make the combine but have not personally confirmed.  I will probably claim my warhorse on my monk, and a chain bridle for upgrading it, since I already have casino's speedy drogmar drum.</div></div><hr />

If I had a medium speed horse and made it a warhorse, later could I upgrade to a 100K horse? It seems like you would be able to, but if you do a second combine would you also get the first bridle back to exchange for some plat?</div></div><hr />

Bought a black horse, and did the combine.... It works =)<br />
<br />
And if you wanted to upgrade it later, Place your new warhorse in and hit combine... It will remove the horse and the warhorse, thus having both again to upgrade later.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhoderas</div><div class="date">03-24-2006, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious what the advantage would be to have a warhorse compared to a regular horse. I didn't see anything mentioned as far as the ability to have spells interrupted less often while getting hit on a warhorse, stuff like that (Wouldn't that be schweet!). Other than the graphic, is there really any difference? Plainly speaking it would cost me about 5.00 extra per expasion to get a horse that doesn't do anything special other than look kewl. not ranting just wondering if there's a difference between the 2 I haven't heard about. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaidman</div><div class="date">03-24-2006, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No differences.</div></div><hr />
