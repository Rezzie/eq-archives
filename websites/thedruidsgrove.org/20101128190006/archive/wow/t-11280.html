On our first run we got through 5 bosses with only two wipes, but than we sort of hit a wall at the baron. We called the raid after about five wipes in two hours. <br />
<br />
Most of the priests were dispelling during this fight, so druids and shamans were left to main heal. Hellfire was really kicking our butts though. Any ideas on good FR gear for druids that wont totally slaughter my mana pool?</div></div><hr />

You can try for weapons like Kindling Staff from BRD (+10 FR w/ stats). Get a Fire Enchant on your cloak or even an Ony Cloak if you can afford it. Flamestrider robes are good too (+10 FR iirc, not sure where its from). If you're getting really desperate. Try getting a Volcanic piece. Flamescarred shoulders are also pretty nice as well (BRD i think).<br />
<br />
Try aiming for about 100+ FR.<br />
Heres a good link for any resistance armor.<br />

Also, we mostly heal the MT on this fight -- any melee dps that are stupid enough to not get out of his waves when they start (the first ones are a lot weaker than the final ones), can blame themselves. ^^<br />
<br />
Basically, ignore everybody but the MT when healing on this fight, if you're struggling like you are. The rest can bandage. Also, if you've got problems keeping the MT up when the baron does his waves, yell at him to get out of range faster -- it sounds more like he needs to improve, not you. :)<br />
<br />
I definitely wouldn't nerf my healing with FR gear in this fight -- it'd only make it harder, since the only fire damage you should be taking is when you're the bomb. <br />
<br />
There are two places in MC where FR gear is good for a healing druid: the lava packs (between Garr and Sulfuron/Golemagg), and Ragnaros.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used flamestrider robes for a long time before getting my cenarion chest and I still have some fire resist bracers that dropped off Incindeous in BRD with +int.<br />
<br />
As Zach mentioned don't worry too much about FR gear except on the lava packs and Rags and on Rags you'll want to have 2 fire resist pots anyways.<br />
<br />
As per the melee, you can toss a rejuv on them if they really won't shut up, but otherwise you should be focusing on the MT.  Sounds like you have the strat down, just takes some practice.  Grats on getting to Gheddon so quickly.</div></div><hr />
