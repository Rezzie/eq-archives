Wow getting a lvl 10 IN there will be really hard. He'll be pulling mobs from accross the cave.</div></div><hr />

When I hit lvl 50, I had my professions maxed, so I had a guildy escort me from Shat to Thrallmaar so I could train.  I was a fricken Ravager/Boar magnet.  We both died once on that walk.  Though that did allow me to pickup the first aid books since the GY is right next to the BE town with the trainer.<br />

Should have given him a tip.:grin:</div></div><hr />

However, their advantage starts to diminish at higher levels. This says it better. A 29 rogue soloing deadmines, taking 3 elites a pull? Try that with a warrior/priest/mage/warlock/hunter/paladin/druid/shaman. It changes as the game progresses, for instance when warrior DPS approaches rogue DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i got to the goblin in the walking saw done ok and was able to easily take on 2 of the elites and 2 non elites at once so im quessing if i take it slowly i should be able to get through the whole thing at 37 :)</div></div><hr />

I'm confident I could have soloed at 40 (balance spec), but I surely would have had problems with the goblins.</div></div><hr />

You'll be lucky to only deal with 2 elites at a time. I really don't think you can get through deadmines without being able to solo 3-4 elite level 20 mobs at a time, which is something more likely done at 40 and above.</div></div><hr />
