<br />
I have heard that with season 3 coming up, your ability to wear arena gear will become dependent on your rating; that is, if you get 2k rating to get the shoulders, but then later your rating falls to 1600, you will no longer be able to use them.<br />
<br />
<br />
My question is; does this only apply to season 3 arena gear?  Or will I no longer be able to wear some of my season 2 pieces?<br />

<br />
The rating requirement is for *purchasing* gear, not wearing it.<br />
<br />
1850 for S3 weapons, and 2000 for shoulders. And it only counts for S3 gear, AFAIK</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone know if we can joined a 2000 rating team for like a day to buy gear and then leave?</div></div><hr />

Beginning with season 3 every player has a &quot;personal&quot; rating in addition to the rating(s) of their team(s). That rating is based on the arena matches the player took part in. <br />
<br />
And it is that personal rating that is checked when purchasing gear.</div></div><hr />

Wow... That could be really good or really bad. I run with a pretty big 5v5 team (the team is full and we make sure everyone on the team gets their points. Consequently, we sit around 1600 rating). When I am on and we 5v5, I get to go with our best healers and our best MS warrior and a freakishly good hunter, so I imagine my personal rating will be good. Our poor priest healer, who goes to all the matches will sadly be stuck at the team rating level. :(</div></div><hr />

Yea no more free rides but this rating system only applies to weapons and shoulders so no matter how bad/unlucky/undergeared you are, you can still earn and save up points and potentially get every piece except the weapons and shoulders (can always go for S2/S1 too). Gives the 'elite' PvPers some distinction from the rest.</div></div><hr />
