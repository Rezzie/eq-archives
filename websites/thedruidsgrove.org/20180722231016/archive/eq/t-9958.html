<br />
Only to have a bard, come along and say that mob belonged to thier group, and HIGHSUN it back to spawn.  <br />
<br />
Which also tends to summon me, or one of my group half-way across the zone.  <br />
<br />
Highsun is a BROKEN, far too easily abusable spell by griefers.<br />
<br />
Ways to Nerf/Fix:<br />
1) Check Agro List.  If the person on top of agro list is not in the bards group, highsun fails.<br />
<br />
2) HighSun puts Bard on top of Agro List +1 like Taunt and Stuns Said Bard for 10 Seconds.  Let them be summoned instead for Highsunning an Agroed/Summoning Mob.</div></div><hr />

As much as wed like to see soe police this kind of behavior better, the reality of the situation is that unless a gm sees it happening with his own eyes nothing is done.  By their very nature these incidents are hard to catch because they happen so quickly.  Hence the ability needs adjustments so that this cant happen.<br />
<br />
Had a bard on my server pull this stunt on us all nite other nite.  Was infuriating</div></div><hr />

It sickens me however to hear that someone is abusing an ability far beyond its intent and irritating other players.  Respectfully, the first option isn't fair to bards that raid, where this might be an appropriate place to use this song.  The second option only benefits that bard further because they will not only take the named from you but will now be with it and able to pull it immediately to their group.<br />
<br />
To fix this problem, I would suggest not allowing the spell or work on npcs that are injured below 99% of their health.  Not only would it resolve this problem but it would probably help raid leaders with inappropriate/accidental usage of this song as well.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp, sorry to hear people do this.  <br />

<br />
That would kill people from being able to reset Xegony when they have a problem and other mobs as well.  kinda kills the whole point of highsun for some strategies.  I think the idea of being in the group or raid would be a better idea.  No sense nerfing an ability.  We have enough of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is HUGE.  no other ability. NONE has the power to take a mob away from me, Im fighting.  NONE.<br />
<br />
So a mob thats anywhere above 50ish percent gets highsunned away from a group allowing easy KS.<br />
<br />
Trains, etc.  u can still damage the mob, to gt that critical 51% to get kill credit.  Sure there are other ways, to bring additional adds to train someone.<br />
<br />
But there is only 1 way, to poach a mob away from a group fighitng it.  Just 1 broken way.</div></div><hr />

Nerfing abiltiies is not the answer - if it was some druid ability that someone was talking about being nerfed because of an illegimate use of it, this board would be up in arms about &quot;sony not thinking things through, nerfing perfectly good abilities because of a few bad players, or SoE is out to get druids&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is an issue of KS, it's ****ing easy to see from the logs who had agro on the mobs first in what group he was and who did the damage, from there it's only a small step to useing this info and bane the griefer.<br />
The problem is that Soe refuse to take that this small step and have been avoiding this for the last few years, i remember a time when GM's would bane peoples for KS, today it's need to be an extreme case of someone KSing a mob in front of 3 GM 2 guides there GF and family member before they will consider a bane.<br />

And from what i remember there is a detailed log saying what happen with mob, i destincly remember that GM used to be able to see who was the one that got the first agro on such mobs as ragefire and Serv.<br />
<br />
As someone who's class get huge amount of &quot;nerf them&quot; posts on other class board i detest posts that call to nerf other classes, your saying highsun is broken since a bard can steal your mob? when a chanter useing memblure + tash can do the same, so can a good cleric (atune+stun+da) it's true the bard is more effective but that's dont mean that other classes can't do it.<br />

And what about the multi-group, non-raiders?  If we have 2 groups working together, but don't have a formal raid going because we don't like the raid experience nerf, bard in group 1 can't use his spell if tank in group 2 has the aggro?<br />

This is just someone KS'ing.  It doesn't matter how he is doing it.  You need to petition it just like any other KS'ing issue, not cry for class/spell/&quot;tool&quot; nerfs.</div></div><hr />

If you will tell me that's it can be used to KS people then the problem is NOT highsun it's KS plain and simple.<br />

<br />
And what type of  bard would Highsun a mob that his group 2 tank is fighting?  Mez maybe,  but sent the mob your tank is on back to its spawn spot?  If this became a problem they could just form a two group raid but then you said you dont like the raid exp..   The only time I could see this as an issue is if you are PLing a 2nd group but even then mez would work.   I guess you are argueing that if the bard brings all the mobs he should be able to have a second group hold them while he sends back all the ones that he doent feel like farming...    yeah.. that would work..  pull them all then send back all but the named...</div></div><hr />

Unless they actually SEE it happen, nothing is done; The bards using highsun in this manner know this ..so they do it with impunity.  I think thats why the clamoring for nerfs, because this ability makes it extremely easy for bards to do this.  Most of the bard population would never consider using this skill in this way; unfortunately in game just as in RL ..it only takes a few bad apples to ruin the batch for everyone</div></div><hr />

One that makes absolutely NO roleplaying sense at all, and is a griefers dream.  But bards in general are a griefers dream, its why 99% of the griefers nowdays seem to play bards.  Selos, DA, Highsun, all make a wonderful griefing package.  Selos and DA make a bit of sense for bards, but I never got where highsun came from, or why it was given, pulling was not the bard's forte, pulling was supposed to be the monks', but oh well, what's done is done, and with EQ's track-record, it will take them about 2 years to fix anything like this.  The way highsun is used just seems patently wrong imo.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">corlathist</div><div class="date">10-20-2004, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What legitimate use is thier for Highsun, when the mob is NOT engaged by your group or your raid?  Name 1 I challenge you.<br />
<br />
Highsun doesn't clear agro, so if 2 groups were teaming to kill something, what possible reason if the bard wasn't puller ((highest on agro list)) would the Bard have to HighSun a mob?  99% of all mobs that 2 groups would team on Summon.   So if you Highsun a mob anyway, its going to summon the tank/etc and start killing people.<br />
<br />
It's not that hard to code a simple check, if the mob isn't agroed on your group or RAID ((ala RZ)) it doesn't work.  They have already showed they have the ability to check if your on same Raid ((RZ, Flags)) or Group ((TLs without a box)) so again, can a single Bard come up with a SINGLE scenerio<br />
where High Sun is useful/needed outside of Raid/Group?<br />
<br />
Give me 1 encounter where Highsun, is useful on a mob thats already engaged.  Obviously if the Mob was pulled by Bard, Bard would be highest/Only on Agro List so Im not talking about a nerf that would effect pulling in anyway.<br />
<br />
I dont care about HighSun/FM as a pull combo, thats fine.  Don't touch that.<br />
<br />
I care about when Highsun is used to throw a mob from a different group that has it engaged.   I've seen this happen in WOS.  I've Seen this happen in Kotd.  I've seen this happen in a variety of places.<br />
<br />
I think one part of the reasoning is because there is a distinction in Player Rules and Everquest Rules.   In SOME CASES, ((vary by people, location, and server)) people claim a mob based on &quot;Camp&quot;.  So if a mob is pulled from that &quot;Camp&quot; Highsun/Trains/Etc are all considered &quot;ok&quot; because the mob was &quot;stolen from the camp.&quot;  Problem is by EVERQUEST rules, the definition differs.  It's first Agro.   If someone else pulls/agros a mob, and you use HighSun, you may think its deserved/okay BUT it is a direct violation of the Everquest Rules.<br />
<br />
Thinking about this reminds me of another time, I had this happen to me in Kotd.   Was Sitting on East wall.  Another group was on South Wall.   Server Crashed.  My group got back in very fast.  Wandering Hynid popped in the South area.   I pulled the Hynid before the south group was fully back/ready.  Keep in mind, this wasn't a Named Spawned by thier efforts of killing a PH, this was a named spawned because of a server crash.  Not to mention it was a wandering field mob.  The bard at South felt it was perfectly valid after we engaged to HighSun the Mob.   Because the Bard Said &quot;we were stealing thier mob.&quot; as if they owned it.  That's the attitude of some players.   And thats the attitude of some bards which promotes HighSunning.</div></div><hr />

Snare has a lot of agro and once they take them to their camp and damage them the previous puller is still high on the agro list if they were snared.   I have learned to Egress after a bard runs by and my mob disappears or if one steals my pulls any more for safety sake.   What is worse is when you end up in their camp from a summon and they accuse you of trying to KS their mob.  (yes this happened two days ago in WoS) <br />
<br />
This is like in the old days when monks/SK/necro pulled a train to your camp and FDed to kill you so they can take a named (or just to grief you).

Back in the day pre-raid function, I can see arguing against changes to high sun with those kind of examples.   <br />
<br />
But this isn't then.   The code does exist to check if mob is on someone on the raid.  RZ does that specifically.   Same code could be added to check on use of highsun.</div></div><hr />

I mean they know who we are.. &quot;SOMETIMES&quot;. <br />
<br />
I had one Bard threaten me the other day.. at the Tables.. when I pull at the tables..  I pull 2-3 mobs at a time so we basically clear all the way up to the pillars and castle area.. not knowing that there was this &quot;New Camp&quot; called pillars.. and the happy Druid Sobe has been pulling there for the last 5 hours.. this bard sent me a tell<br />
<br />
His statement was.. Pillars is mine! - Out of confusion of this new camp.. &quot;have to remember AL was the first to Break Fire on MM/second overall and basically we discovered the Xps camps along with other High End pop guilds.. there just wasn't a need for a new camp.<br />
<br />
So I said.. er.. u solo'ing or something? He said no - &lt;b&gt;we just called pillars!&lt;/b&gt; - I said um I been pulling from there for the last 5 hours.. he said well now its time to stop.. I said .. okay excuse me and maybe its my ignorance.. but is this a new camp.. or something that your just making up ? - He said WTF you some sort of MORON this camp has always been here.. what are you a fooking NOOBIE Ranger???! (of course I am chuckling at this point).. <br />
<br />
So told the group.. group responded stating.. yea .. there is a new camp.. actual a couple since OoW came out.. I said oh.. well what should I do he's claming Pillars.. they said its fine.. just pull tables and castle area.. we will just tone it down some. So.. I continued.<br />
<br />
Bard again starts going off on me.. WTF we got pillars! I said.. I am not pulling from pillars I am pulling from the castle area.. he exclaims YOU NOOBIE RANGER! I AM GOING TO FADE ALL MY MOBS ON YOU. PILLARS INCLUDE CASTLE! - <br />
<br />
This is where.. that little nerve tweaks.<br />
<br />
Okay guy.. u go ahead.. I am sure I can just tank your mobs have fun with your Fade.. &quot;HAHA FOOKING NOOBIE RANGER WHAT ARE U EBAYZ, RANGERS CAN&quot;T TANK THESE!&quot;.. -  told group - group got upset and of course he tried to fade on me.. then realized that I was a Druid the HARD WAY.<br />
<br />
So yes.. griefing happens.. Highsun sure.. it has its faults but overall its saves more raids; groups etc.... FADE is nice but again.. it has its faults.. along with FD and other spells/abilities.. as for us.. EXODUS is nice.. Just one of those things.. we all have .. and try not to abuse.. so before you call for this.. understand there is more at stake.. even in our world!<br />
<br />
I understand the frustration.. but in the end.. what comes around goes around.</div></div><hr />

Nope.  I answered your questions or challenge.  And I'm still right on about them.  A giant running toward thurgadin is &quot;not engaged&quot; by anyone in the raid, or else would not be running toward Thurgadin.  <br />
<br />
Very Simply Put. Highsun should not work on Mobs that are fixated on people NOT in your raid or NOT in your group. Proove me wrong if you can.   <br />
<br />
It was a stranger bard who was simply observing us doing a 10th ring war and taking faction hits (i.e. not part of our raid) that saved us by highsunning the stray giants, and taught us to do the same in the future.  Do I win a prize?  :p<br />
<br />
I dislike intensely calls for nerfing other classes.  You got burned by a griefer, and now want to hurt that griefer's entire class as a result.  Highsun is used to great benefit in higher level raids as well, but I'm less willing to discuss those instances.  I answered your questions literally and you resort to being insulting.  That alone suggests to me your argument for nerfing another class's ability lacks merit.</div></div><hr />

Heh, so a random bard saved you with it one time lol.   Frankly put if you needed that random bard in todays terms you could (a) invite them to your raid function.    (b) frankly put you deserved to lose.  but most importantly.....   again.... you miss the point.    Your example would not be effected by my proposal at all.<br />
<br />
Not in the least.   Stray Giants without Agro on anything, would still allow highsun to work.    Very carefully please, I'm not trying to be insulting but you keep missing the most basic and important point.<br />
<br />
I said IF the Giant HAD agro on some other player NOT group/raided with the bard then and only then would HighSun not work.  <br />
<br />
Unagroed Mobs === Highsun Works<br />
Mobs Agroed by the Bards Group === Highsun Works<br />
Mobs Agroed by the Bards Raid === Highsun Works<br />
<br />
Mobs Agroed by another Group/Raid === Highsun Fails.<br />
<br />
You'd have still been saved by random bard<br />
And you still havent given an example of a legitimate use of Highsun when someone outside the bards raid or group has Agro.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Sobe I understand where your coming from.   And training/griefing if you could code ways to stop faded/fd trains without changing/nerfing the ability<br />
Im sure people would.<br />
<br />
But you got to admit what I am proposing with Highsun is far different than what you are saying.    The Code as evidenced by things like Invis/Tls exists to check groups.    <br />
<br />
Hell though Invis code can go away now thanks.  Speaking of Invis its the same perfect example here as highsun.  Invis was changed to group only because people were killing pets with it.   Sure 99% of people werent using it to grief, but it was simple fix to make it group only and that made the game better.<br />
<br />
Your example boils down to a basic flawed premise.  You can't fix all griefing, so dont fix highsun.  Thats like saying you can't stop all murder, so why make it illegal.   Anytime you can fix even a fraction of the ways people grief others, it makes the shared game world better.<br />
<br />
Likewise I lived with Highsun as is, didnt call for nerfs because of griefers, until I realized that not only does the code to check in group exist...<br />
But so does the code to check in raid.   Ala RZ, Ala Projections, etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please stop trying to prove you are so much better than everyone else and you are right and everyone else is wrong.  In all honesty you are both right.  The extra bard was not griefing, he was helping.  Also, your proposed &quot;fix/nerf&quot; should be fine.  You are all just arguing semantics.<br />
<br />
Griefers of all classes have their ways.  You can't just take all the tools away because someone abuses them.  I still would like a nice steak knife for my t-bone, even though some moron killed his wife with a similar knife last week.   :bonk:</div></div><hr />

Maybe example is a little too far, I grant you.   But I was simply trying to point out one of the things I see in life all the time.   Someone uses the idea that you can't fix everything, to justify not fixing something.   And as a concept I have a problem with that.  Sure you can't fix every form of griefing, but again why not fix those you can?<br />
<br />
<br />
Beast:<br />
<br />
None of your posts seemed directed at me/asked me a question.  *Shrug*<br />
I took &quot;You&quot; in your posts to refer to previous poster, not me.   Names or Quotes ensure you get a response.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I agree with you in principle that the idea is KSing is wrong, and yes GMs should be the answer.   But, heres where I bend to practicality.   GMs are not the answer.  They dont respond quick enough.  And as for banning the KSer lets face it, I doubt many people cancel billing because a KSer wasn't punished sufficiently.   While Banning would likely be the bigger issue.<br />
<br />
In either case though, I disagree with your principle which boils to &quot;Allow Griefing to occur then punish it.&quot;   I vastly prefer &quot;Prevent Griefing when possible.&quot;  Sure makes everyones game more enjoyable than spending an hour, or whatever dealing with GMs to get the issue resolved.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
Let's twist the discussion a moment to make a point.<br />
What would you do if TLs had thier TL box removed?   If a wizard with a wave of fingers could port you to zone in, or to CT, or to fear.<br />
<br />
Would that be acceptable use of power of teleportation?  <br />
<br />
After all the TL box can be a PITA, especially if you want to be sent to zone in which means you must be in the Wizards group.   So for at least TL to evac point, it should just work right?<br />
<br />
Do you realize how many petitions, how many problems, how many grief issues that would raise?   I'm certain too that 95% of wizards would use<br />
this responsibly.   It's the 5% of wizards that would become a bane<br />
<br />
There's plent of precedent in Game Already where simple changes were put into place to prevent griefing.<br />
<br />
1) Invis Change:  Group Only to prevent Grief Pet Poofing.<br />
2) TL Boxes Needing a Confirmation<br />
3) TL to Zone Evac being group only.<br />
<br />
Again, Im not saying Nerf the core ability of Highsun.   I am saying Nerf the one easy method its used to grief.   Make it group &amp; raid only.<br />
<br />
And yes, I will acknowledge their are other ways to grief.  Memblurs, and FD, and Trains, etc.  But so what?  Fix those methods of griefing you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The giant was created by the raid.  That is like saying that the mobs that spawn from a named during a PoP or OoW raid are &quot;Not Engaged&quot;.  Once they spawn they agro.  The giants in this case agro Thurgadin and the dwarves and the raid is there to protect them.  They were created by the raid and if someone other than the raid agros them it is by poor planning on part of the raid in not warning people.  <br />
<br />
It was a stranger bard who was simply observing us doing a 10th ring war and taking faction hits (i.e. not part of our raid) that saved us by highsunning the stray giants, and taught us to do the same in the future.  <br />
<br />
So you are saying that a random bard decided to interfer in the raid.  I can think of so many things wrong here I cannot list them all.  What if he Highsuns a mob that is being root/rotted or snare/arrow killed? or one that is being pulled to a group to kill as part of the raid?  The puller has to start over.  What if a druid is kiting it away.  He loses track of it.  In both cases if the giant summons suddenly you have people pulled away from the raid if the giant gets damages by some random ranger that likes to shoot arrows at giants..   If you have an organized plan and someone outside of your raid starts zapping mobs away on you, I think that is interfering.  <br />
<br />
Do I win a prize?  :p.<br />

Sigh.. not the prize you wanted.. <br />

Repeating that you miss read his question several times and then not anwering based on the question does not show a very clear understanding of his arguement so you cannot judge its merit. I agree he is getting a bit testy but your replies are not to the issue.   Everyone seems to agree that it has great benefit and should not be nerfed in its ablity to function.  He never said it didn't have a positive use.  Try reading his &quot;Challenge&quot; again..</div></div><hr />

Rallos Zek encounter. Tanks on the adds during fake RZ stage get saved when the bards high sun them.  <br />
Kinda off topic, but in both cases you should have lost the encouter. If you can't handle the adds, you have no business winning them. Highsun is overpowered, and they should never have put it in the game in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Extremely rare is the circumstance in which a bard would have legitimate cause to send another group/raid's mob back to its spawn point.  It is sensible to preclude such a rare 'good' circumstance in the interest of preventing such an ability to be used in a way not intended by designers. And let's assume Verant/SOE did not design any abilities expressly for KSing or griefing. <br />
<br />
Similarly, if I saw someone sitting directly in the path of a hostile mob, casting invis on them could be a good thing. However, casting invisibility on someone can have negative consequences (e.g. failing a quest exchange, causing a healer to lose them from target, etc.) ... therefore, the ability is restricted to group-only. Sure, limiting it to group-only doesn't prevent mishaps, but this restriction universally prevents the ability from being used maliciously by those outside your group.<br />

<br />
Highpowered or not, its not fair to say someone should have lost an encounter because they used an ability given for the same purpose. As they didnt &quot;sploit&quot; anything they did nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
On topic however, everyones suggesting making it group aggro only, but whereas games like FFXI and EQ2 have the &quot;its aggrod its mine&quot; coding, EQ1 does not. Is them attempting to put this in worth the 400 other bugs its likely to cause? No. Its not. In addition, griefers shouldnt be handled by nerfing the class in which they play - they should be handled individually on a given server. Flame em, reject them, petition them, whatever gets you to sleep at night, but targetting a whole class is unfair. <br />
<br />
I personally have never had this happen to me, and wouldnt expect it to in the areas / people I play with. If you expected anything else from the masses in WoS then you were fooling yourself. Its called BoT 2.0 for a reason.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately I have been the victim to highsun's use in WoS and that was not the situation.    <br />
<br />
This is a simular situation to invis as mentioned.  When I hit lv 10 and was hunting in Oasis I learned really quick to fear the sand giants.   My first experience with them was casting a heal on someone only to turn around and see a giant boot and &quot;Loading please wait&quot; ..  (Lesson 1, do not heal someone running by, there is probably a reason they are running).  Once I had caught the boat back (forgot to bind in freeport) and looted my corpse,  I started casting camo on people for their safety ...  A few seconds later one of the people that I invis'ed /shouted &quot;Hey, who cast invis on me?&quot;.  Thinking he wanted to thank me I /ooc'ed that I did...   Unfortunately the mage I cast it on didn't appreciate the madman beating on him and my L337 language proficiency went up a couple of points.   <br />
<br />
A few months later invisibility was &quot;Fixed&quot; so you couldn't cast it on people outside of your group.   Just an example of a very good spell with very good uses that needs to be fixed so it cannot be used to cause others grief. <br />
<br />
Personnally I never expect a fix to this.  If they could fix this then they could also flag first agro on a mob which could be used to prevent KSing and that is not practical with all of the other &quot;Bugs&quot; that need to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bards were supposed to be jack of all trades. Someone who could do everything, and their downside was that they couldn't do those things as well as the speciality class. But since PoP there are things that only bards can do along with all the things they could already do pretty well. Highsun is one of them. I think that's the reason some people are calling for bard nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Bad analogy.  You can't stop murder, so instead you put in the deterence factors and put energy into catching the murderer.  Similarly in EQ, that answer is not nerfing another class.  If Corlathist spent half the energy into making a record against the griefer as he has in asking that bards be nerfed, I think that would go a lot further in stopping other potential griefers.  (Perhaps he has posted to the guild the griefer belongs to, or the server boards naming the griefer, or even the bard class boards naming the griefer.  I just haven't seen any indication of such.)<br />
<br />
As to whether we should have lost the 10th ring war or not is not really relevant.  I answered Coraliths questions (challenges) exactly as posed.  <br />
<br />
My point is simple enough.  There are many ways to steal a mob from another group.  Many such ways have already been listed in this thread.  The problem is not the abilities, but the person using them wrongfully.  I think the better and easier solution is going after the griefer, rather than calling for nerfing another class's ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When /targetgroupbuff first went in, the very first day, you could /tgb ports (this was before translocates, iirc.)  Anyone could get immediately ported to poHate (you know, the original one that sucked when you ported into it) or anywhere else.  Later that same day the servers were brought down, and this ability was nerfed.  Now this feature, which could conceivably have many legitimate uses, was far more open to abuse, and the potential disruption ir could cause was greater than the convenience gained, so it was removed.<br />
<br />
Kulothar already mentioned the invis thing.  Same deal.  (Although it should be noted that it could probably be changed back now, since pets dont poof when their owners go invis now... but thats another discussion!)<br />
<br />
It's a function of any society to make decisions where individual convenience must be sacrificed for the greater stability.  This is really no different.  The potential and actual every day abuses of highsun far outweigh the benefit it *might* have, especially now that the code seems to exist for restricting it to mobs aggro'd on the bards group/raid.  Nobody is honestly saying it should be removed entirely, but this very light restriction would have no impact on people who are playing nicely.  There would be basically no functionality lost by putting in this restriction, none that is actually used in a beneficial way every day, and an entire category of griefing could be eliminated.  Be honest, the number of times a driveby bard has *helpfully* highsunned a mob away from me is exactly zero.  Seems like an easy decision to me.</div></div><hr />

Gimme a break.  Like has been said thats Crap of Logic.  Because you can't stop EVERY method of griefing doesnt mean you dont stop those you can.<br />
<br />
But more importantly even your example as a way to get around the group/raid restriction only is weak as hell.  Like the group/raid your trying to do this is not going to be enganging the mob?   The moment chanter mezzes it, its broke.   The moment memblur hits so does reagro.    <br />
<br />
The whole point....  the whole point....  is to prevent Highsuns instant poof a engaged mob that is engaged by a different group/raid.     Of all the griefing methods, this one is by far the most instantaneous in its effect, and the easiest to fix since the code is already there for spells like invis and encounters like RZ.</div></div><hr />

Highsun, can be a GODSEND.   Xegony is the perfect example.   I'd say that highsun there has been essential to our progress.<br />
<br />
BUT...  I've never seen Highsun used positively when the bard isnt with the Group or the Raid encountering the mob.<br />
<br />
Coding it to only work if the mob is agroed on the Raid or agroed on the group in question, wouldnt stop all the great uses of highsun.<br />

PS: yes memblur wipes agro.  BUT, if the mob is engaged by an opposing group your talking pure luck for Highsun to land in the split second the mob is unagroed, rather than the group/raid it was fighting</div></div><hr />

I dont know why Highsun was added but thats the only encounter I have seen that it has a use. Because of the timing need to do the event, because they are not mobs that can be offtanked.</div></div><hr />

One is lv 68 and the other 69.  They could not think of any reason to use Highsun outside of their group or raid.  The both thought coding it to not work on another persons mob wasnt a good idea since it could be used to save someones life.  When we discussed it being used to steal pulls they both agreed that the coding to not work on already agroed mobs was not a nerf and was better than it being used to grief.   A couple of suggestions were: <br />
<br />
1) If a mob can summon, have Highsun not work if agro'd by someone outside of the raid or group or have any &quot;existing&quot; agro passed to the bard. This would still allow griefing but I wouldnt get summoned into the bards camp any more.  <br />
2) having a pop-up box for the person with agro to accept the Highsun on their mob. <br />
<br />
We are not discussing making the song less powerful, just defining its conditions for usage to those helpful to solo, grouping or raids uses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neglecting problems because of a fear that the 'fix' might yield bugs, is just not an excuse any responsible programmer would ever dare use.  <br />
<br />
If you lost 5k HP every time you cast a buff, you'd expect them to fix (asap) and you'd rightfull expect that fix to be tested thoroughly enough to rule out most possible glitches. <br />
<br />
I don't know why people let devs off the hook so easily. If you expect less than a reasonable level of competency from a game's developers, that's usually what you end up getting. <br />

It actually messes the game up, imo.  You may as well give warriors/pallys a spell that summons any mob to them that they can get on target.  (Opposite effect, but similar in power imo).  Just to be able to say &quot;be gone&quot; and a mob be gone, I agree, it will save your butt, but its out of whack as an ability to pull with.  NOBODY can come close to that ability, not close.  I guess Im old and crotchety, and miss the days of what &quot;I&quot; considered legitimate pulling with monks and FD, and with SK's being able to fill in, in a pinch, and with all classes being able to be substituted in certain situations, but with a slight downgrade (ie, sk for monk, chanter's slow for shammys, a few druids to fill in for cleric, bard to fill in for chanter on mez, etc).<br />
<br />
To me, its a ridiculously powerful spell when used for its legitimate use, and even more ridiculously powerful when used to grief with.</div></div><hr />

Can you think about needing to cast snare every 18 sec?<br />
There is a price to pay for haveing those abilities, and there is a reason why despite there uberness so few people play bards.</div></div><hr />

Wow.   If the code is already in place on an ability.  It sure as heck can't be that big a deal to apply the same code to another spell.</div></div><hr />
