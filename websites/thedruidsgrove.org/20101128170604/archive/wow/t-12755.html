<br />
am i right in thinking that you can exchange these for T6 type of gear ?  from someone on the Isle of QD ?<br />
<br />
and all you need is 1 mote per item ? you dont need anytrhing else?  just 1 single little blue item mote ?<br />
<br />
ie never have stepped into or even near Sunwell Plateau let alone the likes of MH/BT ? no attunement or anything ?<br />
<br />
as if all you need 1 is Sunmote for a pretty brilliant upgrade to a gear slot then the price seems reasonable to someone with too much money, nothing to spend it on and with the absolute that they will never see the inside of any 25 man raid instance.<br />
<br />
or am i missing something very basic somewhere along the line !</div></div><hr />

You turn those in combined with a sunmote to get some new piece of gear.  Its not as simple as just a sunmote.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thanks for this - i need to investigate more before spending gold !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sunmote (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34664)<br />
<br />
You can click the &quot;Currency For&quot; and &quot;Reagent For&quot; tabs to see what you can get with them.<br />
<br />
You'll need BoP drops for the &quot;Currency For&quot; list, but just some mats for the &quot;Reagent For&quot; list (and someone who can make the item.</div></div><hr />

Say what you will about how easy PvP gear is to get, that Bladed Chaos Tunic (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34397) is unbelievable for Cat DPS. Three different gem slots make it very adaptable. And jeez, the Harness of Carnal Instinct (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34211) you trade in w/ a sunmote is awesome as it is for Bear form. I think it's a lot harder to get into Sunwell Plateau (time and guild commitment) than getting some honor in BG and buying 2 season old gear.<br />
<br />
Thank god I can get PvP gear because I'll probably never come close to that item. :cry: :cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kheldar</div><div class="date">07-31-2008, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah i agree Vika.<br />
<br />
amazing gear and if it was only that you needed a sunmote.........but having read that you have to swap in something else from Sunwell i'm never going to be seeing the need to buy sunmotes.<br />
<br />
i've ended up up with 4 of the s2 items. 2 of which i use for bear.</div></div><hr />
