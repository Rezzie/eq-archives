Log in my druid and do nothing so i switch to an alt, and do nothing. After about an hour or two of logging different charcters in and out i finally log off.<br />
<br />

There's rep to grind, gold to farm, tradeskills to level, instances to get attuned to, gear to get, arena, heck even weapon skills!<br />
<br />
Now do that again with an alt and thats a whole lot of gaming fun to be had.<br />
<br />
The only time I 'hit a wall' was when I realized that TBC would come out within a couple months so I stopped raiding and thought I did but realized the PvP set's 15% speed bonus would be awesome for leveling.<br />
<br />
Still use it today =o and yes it still rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harpo</div><div class="date">03-15-2007, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, happens every few months to me. Spend an intensive time (about 50hrs+ a week) playing. Rushing back from work to go to Kara or something and ending up not having time to eat. Then I realise wtf am I doing so I quit for a week or so. After a bit I log on to &quot;check my mail&quot;, get asked to go raid something and it all starts again.<br />
<br />
Just take a break and the love will return ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Claritondeus</div><div class="date">03-15-2007, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm at a point now where I have so many 'little' things to do:  grind rep, quest for gold, that I sometimes don't know where to start.  And all the things that I really want to do, i.e. run instances for rep / gear, require a minimum of 2+ hour investment.  <br />
<br />
It seems taht if I want to do anything meaningful with my druid anymore, I have to block out like 4 hours.  <br />
<br />
I logged on last night and tried for about 30 min to get a group to kill the Deathwail guy on top of the Black Temple for my Verdant Gloves, and ended up logging off frustrated after not being able to get anyone to help.  Happened like this the past 3 nights.  <br />
<br />
Oh well, that's why I have a lv 22 Orc Hunter.  I can play mindlessly for an hour and maybe get a level or something and have some fun.  So yeah Anu, I feel ya.  I have like 6 alts that I fool around on, and occasionally I find myself staring at the login screen thinking &quot;who am I gonna play today?&quot;</div></div><hr />

After about 20 minutes of mindlessly walking around somewhere I realise what a waste of time it is and go off on an alt or call up a mate, its just te way of life that every now and then you will get completely lost (e.g. seperately from wow: going to the fridge opening it and forgetting what I want, then remembering as I close the door, then forget once the fridge is open, repeated about 5 times it gets annyoing)<br />
My advise is just to take a little break, then come back in a bit and you will be back on track</div></div><hr />

I hit 69 last weekend, but I've been spending more time this week playing around on an alt or helping some lower-level guildies with some stuff. A lot of people in my guild are breaking my stones and telling me to hurry up and get to 70 so I can start playing with the grown ups again....I just figure I'll get there when I get there.</div></div><hr />

Bigtime.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda addicted to lvling alts too all of a sudden.  Argh.  <br />
<br />
Got a lv 12 Draeni shaman, lv 11 Blood Elf Mage, lv 19 human pally, lv 22 orc hunter, lv 36 tauren warrior, lv 36 human rogue, then my first main alt priest and second main alt warlock.<br />
<br />
I wanted to try out each of the races / starting areas and classes.  Too much stuff to do, too little time.<br />
<br />
*edit*  no desire whatsoever tho to play troll or gnome.  death to both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ixeos</div><div class="date">03-16-2007, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">have a lvl 21 Draenei Hunter..... such easymode, and w/ gift of the naru = heelz on pet I can solo 3-4mobs pretty easily if I have to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 My very first character was a tauran shaman that i got to level 44 before i found out a couple freinds were playing and they made me go alliance :P.<br />
<br />
 I liked the play style of the shaman before and I still do. I have always been a sucker for hybrids. Started him yesterday and bingo, hit lvl 20 today (woot! ghost wolf). Then i made the mistake of going to the shaman boards looking for spec information.<br />
<br />
 Damn is every class board full of nothing but people bashing and complaining about their class? Seems like thats all i see no matter what class I look at. Anyways Shoctopus will be my only alt project from now on.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menellinde</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before BC came out I got completely bored with my druid, which is horde, and wanted to see how the other half lived, so I made an alliance hunter on another server.  Levelled that to 60 then realized I could use a herb farmer and made a mage.  Levelled that to 60 while waiting on the xpack and found I liked it better than the hunter, mage is now 70 too.<br />
<br />
Changed professions on my druid a million times also out of boredom ( started skinner / leatherworker to 300 then tried herb / alch to 300, then did herb / ench to 200, now mining / JC at 375 ).  Changed professions on my mage ( started herb / alch, now tailor / ench ).<br />
<br />
Druid is at least revered ( nearly exalted ) with all factions, has all keys up to and including khara, has all the non-raid gear she can get for the most part and is pretty much &quot;done&quot; other than farming raid mats / gold / JC patterns.<br />
<br />
Now I can do all that again on my mage yay!<br />
<br />
If you haven't done it before, making alts on a new server in the faction you're not used to can be fun, and revitalize the game for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khar</div><div class="date">03-22-2007, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before BC I was so involved with raiding/farming for raids/pvping for new gear to mess with I really didn't get burnt out, then BC hit and I got even more &quot;addicted&quot; I guess because leveling to 70 and trying out the new zones and instances was such a blast.  Then I hit 70 and still had a blast with new instances and getting upgrades for my gear (plus finishing quests), everything seemed fine... then it kinda hit me like 3 weeks ago out of the blue, when I realized I had no more quests except group ones, lol.  I was burnt out.  <br />
<br />
I guess it was partially due to the fact I got to 70 and got keyed faster than most of my guildies, so while I was starting to get all hyped up about heroic instances and such, my guildies were like &quot;Setah, help us save Thrall!&quot; and the like.  I helped save Thrall I dunno how many times when I didn't need to, just to help out... but I got a bit bored I guess.  :(  <br />
<br />
So I took a bit of a break for the most part.  I tried alts, just couldn't get into them again (2 alts are stuck at 44/45, which are the hard levels for me).  After pvping for some gear before BC I was really burnt out on pvp (still am), so I haven't stepped foot in a BG since.  I had fun whining to guildies about needing Steamvaults runs all the time for a while, but got my rep pretty quickly surprisingly, got my Earthwarden and was done with that.  I ran heroic instances with another guild for a few days because they were suddenly short on tanks, had a blast, but I guess their warriors became active again or something because they stopped inviting me along.  I got 9 badges of justice, hard to say when I'll get more, which is a bit dissappointing because I was so drooling over that tank neck/ring.  :(  My guild hasn't even completed a heroic yet.<br />
<br />
So now I pop on during peak times every 2 days or sometimes more, just to see if anyone's doing a run I need (I need Mechanar for my Arc key, need Botanica for the staff... and that's it really).   I'll help guildies out with a run sometimes too.  I went back to an older game I played for years just for a change of pace, for now.  <br />
<br />
My guild's still not in Kara, and I love them to death, but I really wanna give it a go.  We're finally going to give it a try this weekend, but hard to say how we'll do because a lot of people need better gear still.  But I'm hopeful.  :)  <br />
<br />
BC was hard on a lot of people because of the fact that everyone leveled at different rates.  A lot of my friends are kinda burnt out right now, some are making new alts too.</div></div><hr />
